nt|yorkbeach:  welcome everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Hi Geoff|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  The system card for NS is http://www.wbu.org.uk/Int/2012/Trials/Systems/PGMP_2012v6.pdf|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  The system card for EW is http://www.wbu.org.uk/Int/2012/Trials/Systems/pjs-fk-wbf-card-2012.pdf|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  The systems are quite similar|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what you are going to see here is a 20 board stanza|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  effectively it completes a 31 board match|pg||
nt|vugraphzhg: Hi everyone, welcome to sunny Newport on the South Wales Riviera|pg||
nt|roswolf: how is it scored cross-imps ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there is a score from the first 11 boards - I shall let you know what is in a minute|pg||
nt|roswolf: more big fits|pg||
nt|roswolf: anything could happen in the next few minutes|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|roswolf: no0rth really passed!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a 13hcp hand?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@c transfer to @d it seems|pg||
nt|roswolf: the murk descends or maybe the start of fireworks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card says transfer after a @s overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: 21C I THNK IS A TRANSFER|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  remember @c may be a doubleton, as it is here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: HMM  a splinterÂ¬!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is dbl here!?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  must be as 2@d would be a normal force|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would want to ahve a better hand for the bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed julian|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  1@c is natural on this hand but is often a balanced hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi guys and all,  looks like splinter,  hope n/'s have discussed what ever next bid should be |pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: hi shirley we will find out soon!|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  we do not seem to have the correct auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  I am sure North will have opened|pg||
nt|vugraphzhg: sorry - wrong boards !|pg||
nt|roswolf: more darkness than light i suspect|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I agree with Julian,  I would perfer a better hand for the W bid |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South's X showing extras - will act as a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: might not north pass for blood!?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has not shown any diamond support - I think he his choosing between 3Nt and 4@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: how much blood is it? |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bidding suggests NS will not get rich from 3@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will never know:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  probably 1 down in 3@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: now is south thinking of reaching for the sky!?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: maybe|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  he must think that North has an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm this looks an icarus moment flying very close to disaster|pg||
nt|roswolf: but they land on their feet|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yorkbeach:  East just needs to avoid blowing a trick on the lead to beat this - will be obvious North has the @sK from 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2 aces to lose|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  all depends upon position of the @hQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will be out of luck|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  I would not have found the overcall|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: not vul etc   6 of them |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d = one major|pg||
nt|roswolf: nor me but taking advantage of the colours|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a lot of losers and not much of a suit|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|roswolf: they might find the moysian fit now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes South can pass, allowing North to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D plays well also |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East had passed South could have bid 4@d|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|roswolf: does south's pass mean anything in particular|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh,  I play the XX as first round control |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like North is trying to show a half stopper|pg||
nt|roswolf: so do i 3nt beckons!?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South bids the chunky 4@s again sensibly|pg||
nt|roswolf: does north relise that|pg||
nt|roswolf: realise|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is very murky|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe S should have bid 4 @D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this lands them in a great spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: by hook by crook |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Q32 is not ideal for a Moysain but South has now bid the suit twice - and North knows that if EW have the 1HAK then surely South has the @sAK|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they got there|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  on the West hand I would prefer to hear 1NT-3NT and lead a low heart|pg||

nt|roswolf: a downgrade!?|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer does not West to get in and lead a second heart|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  @s7 will be the entry if he plays to ruff out the @c|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  1NT = 14-16|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: may well be wrongsided|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s = transfer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  depends upon what 2NT from West shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Qx would be enough to qulify as support for some but I am not sure of the EW agreement|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  jump to 4@c may be RKCB|pg||
nt|vugraphzhg: I think 2NT denies good support|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if we get 4NT from West, it wil be showing 2 key cards plus the @cQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the pause suggests 4@c might be something else|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a position where they should know what they are showing/denying but i somehow haqve my doubts|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: wd|pg||
nt|sybarra: plop!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West thinks that by bidding 4@h he has denied a @d control|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so East's 4@s shows controls in both spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: they did know what they were doing:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes my mistake about the 4@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: np:)|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  yes I do not like opening 2Nt with a singleton unless it is the king|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  if it is an ace or a low card, your hand has more playing strength than partner expects if you play in a suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  at least the 4@c cue gave North the chance to show extras|pg||
nt|roswolf: north is clearly tempted to make 1 more try|pg||
