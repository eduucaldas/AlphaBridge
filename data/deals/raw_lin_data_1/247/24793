mb|2N|mb|p|nt|petergill: with the good five card suit, N hand looks like 23 count , not 22, to me|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|gronkvist:  4@D is trfto @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: transfer to 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Every bid ex 3@c here is trf in their 2 Nt system|pg||
nt|ritong: other room, east opened a weak two and was raised to 4|pg||
nt|ritong: north opted for silence|pg||
nt|petergill: Will make unless @D lead produces eventual @D ruff |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I cant understand that pass bye N|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|nt|ritong: surprising, but efficient somehow, when doubling would lead her to go down in 5@h|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: but South can pitch @D on @s so no ruff|pg||

nt|ritong: the swing was in fact created by rokia's conservative initial pass   @hKxx could be an explanation|pg||

pc|d2|nt|sybarra: well @S loser might be avoidable |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: heart finesse wrong  and on diamond lead KQ@C garbage   this could be a swing one way or the other|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now a an easy make even if missguess @s|pg||
nt|petergill: wikipedia on restricted choice http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice|pg||
nt|petergill: France lacks some of their usual champion players in this event, but is qualifying fairly easily for the Finals. Catherine d'Ovidio is not playing here, but is playing in next ...|pg||

nt|petergill: 4 imps behind, Sweden have a good score on the last board|pg||
nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: the defense was a killer here |pg||
nt|sybarra: in our room |pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|petergill: In the Open field, 12 NS pairs so far have played Bd 32, for two -1100's and two -750's |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|petergill: One of those Open 1100's was in 4@SX|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ritong: vives is not at ease  K865 rates to be a single stopper|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ritong: so if in 3NT you likely have to be able to cash 8 direct winners after the announced @s lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra Rimstedt did well at the other table not to let NS off the hook - by her disciplined (forcing) Pass of 3@D, when many lesser players in her seat would bid 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|ritong: therefore they go for the moysian fit  i like this|pg||

nt|petergill: without playing a top club from dummy|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
