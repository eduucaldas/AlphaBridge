nt|petergill: 5@CX is 300. 5@H is interesting - spade lead to @H contract is unlikely ... on @C lead, @D to ace, another club to shorten dummy's trumps, should make 5@H I think  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he could have defended 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: West might re-evaluate if South bids 4@C - with known club shortage opposite|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: a lot of thinking going on|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I take it all back sob :(|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: hard to stomach after the lead :(|pg||

mb|d!|mb|2D!|nt|kiwibridge: X=ss and system on transfer|pg||
