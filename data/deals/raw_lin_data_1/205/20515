mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|cicus: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: Hi all. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Gabor|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|gluckenval: 2@D = 4+@H.... può appunto essere solo 4° quando si hanno le @S più lunghe|pg||
nt|figb_rama: i risultati di tutti i play-off e i play-out sono su www.federbridge.it|pg||
nt|figb_rama: sezione gare / campionati|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 3 3@H è mano minima col fit 4°|pg||
nt|gioffi: se non attacca @c secon do me Lorenzo le fa|pg||
nt|zebutin: 2@H was good @S raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: l'uscita sembra favorevole al dichiarante, che altrimenti avrebbe avuto qualche cosa da indovinare, più d'una|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Should be manageable, but must be a little careful|pg||
nt|zebutin: so taking @H, and playing @S? or trying to toss @H away for @D?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pbmarstr: I guess 2 @S shows heart and a minor and that 3 @H is a good raise in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: both way will succeed I think, even cashing ace, king of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn:  Ã vet nok at det er 12 stikk. Men er det to tapere fÃ¶rst?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: result will be the same|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pbmarstr: should be an easy contract now|pg||
nt|cicus: a good stop as even 5@S may have been in jeopardy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|pbmarstr: we will see|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|cicus: I presume S has shown a minimum with 3@C and shortness with 4@C|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: ace of clubs, trumps and diamonds work now of course|pg||
nt|zebutin: for some that finese of @S might seem peculiar, because other player allready has shown he doesn't have any spades left. But quite normal play to keep control.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c8|pc|sK|nt|gioffi: ora A@S e @S tagliata se S surtaglia il dichiarante fa 10 prese a tagli in croce se non surtaglia potrebbe sbagliare la @H i finale|pg||
nt|gluckenval: noi vediamo che è tutto diviso bene, ma Lorenzo sta pensando a come fare la mano anche con le @H o le @S messe male|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|cicus: can't be sure but 3+S was probably a waiting bid with balanced distribution|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S|pg||
pc|c3|mc|11|nt|sverjohn: For new viewers: This is a paractice match between the Swedish BB team and Norway's open team which is not qualified|pg||

nt|pbmarstr: Grøtheim-Tundal is not among the fastest pairs in Norway|pg||

nt|sverjohn: Sweden has won the first 2 matches and show great form.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Peter Marstrander|pg||
nt|rodvenn:  Han spilte med oddsen og lot seg ikke lure av Boye.|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|pbmarstr: Hi|pg||
mb|d!|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|gluckenval: non sono sicuro che sia stato quello visto...|pg||
nt|zebutin: this had some chances to be roundpass|pg||
nt|zebutin: but quite normal looking 3rd hand opening from brogeland|pg||
mb|p|nt|gioffi: certo A@H non l'ha giocato|pg||
nt|gluckenval: anzi, tenderei ad escluderlo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: adesso non posso richiedere, comuqnue sicuramente fatte|pg||
mb|d!|nt|figb_rama: Francesca conferma fatte|pg||
nt|zebutin: and for some even normal looking 1st hand opening|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I wouldn't fancy chances in 4@s, 3NT better|pg||
mb|p|nt|figb_rama: quando c'è tempo e modo, dettagli :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@H was a pass or correct bid (S should bid 2@S if he has spades, not hearts)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Bad conscience now? |pg||
nt|sverjohn: No reason to pull whatsoever. Defencive values a lot better than most preempts|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|gioffi: ottimo 5@D per NS|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Yesterday the swedes won the two preliminary matches and lead substantially in the first "KO" match, but NOrway made a come-back and won the first "KO". So today we will see which ...|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: team is the strongest in the end|pg||
nt|cicus: 2nd X obviously T/O, interesting that E decided to defend at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|ianmcc: A deep position - doubling 2 of major|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gioffi: dopo l'apertura di Ovest|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 2 @C was artificial and showed spade support|pg||
nt|johnp: fine lead for ops|pg||
nt|cicus: he probably reckoned his heart honours won't be a great asset in a spade contract, facing shortness|pg||
nt|ianmcc: or rather converting Double|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|gluckenval: volendo, mi sembra anche 4@H, ma meglio 5@D.... basta K o J di @H in Est|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: @C 5 was high enough!|pg||
nt|warrens:  with a @d lead, looks like 1600|pg||
nt|cicus: do they play 16-board session? I expected 20|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gluckenval: o comunque indovinarle... non va bene giocare A@H e @H alla Q|pg||
nt|gluckenval: c'è da adire che Alfredo ha mostrato almeno 9 carte nere.....|pg||
nt|sverjohn: well, well e-w will probaly have a small discussion here|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|pbmarstr: A very risky penalty double here for a start|pg||
nt|rodvenn:  11 stikk her hvis han rekker Ã¥ komme frem og tilbake|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|zebutin: so brogeland seems to be losing 2@H, 2@D and needs to quess @C right to make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: website said 16|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gioffi: diciamo che basta il sorpasso al K@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pbmarstr: But as the cards lie the contract will go min one down|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|cicus: time to lead back a club for the ruff|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gioffi: l'eliminazione dopo il normale attacco @C è automatica|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|ianmcc: defence faltering maybe only 100|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cicus: oh, W may have felt the spades were threatening so he opened @Ds instead|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|sverjohn: Yes The Swedes had actually overbid the hand|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 2 @H is probably around 10-12 |pg||
nt|sverjohn: Should not miss the trump queen from the bidding|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cicus: EW still have 3 trump ticks and two side suit winners so -2 it seems|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no 300 I think, not bad value 4@s hard|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pbmarstr: I would have taken the diamond finesse at this point|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|gioffi: appunto|pg||
nt|cicus: so while it could have been 500, this 300 gives 9 fat IMPs to Australia, only 3 IMP's lost on defence|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think 3Nt beaten if careful|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pbmarstr: trying to lacate the heart honors now before the club guess|pg||
nt|zebutin: @H Q play most likely is just to get better picture of how points are distributed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodvenn:  Ãst har mange stikk, men kommer ikke til dem selv. Kanskje han fÃ¥r hjelp?|pg||
nt|rodvenn:  At spardamen vant stikk forteller ikke mye. Boye dukker nesten alltid med den fargen i bordet|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pbmarstr: But he will get that trick anyway when Grøtheim keeps his diamonds|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|rodvenn:  han tar den sikre finessen|pg||
nt|rodvenn:  Hvis han tÃ¶r Ã¥ stole pÃ¥ fordelingskastene i spar, vet Cullin at sparkappen gÃ¥r nÃ¥. hvordan komme inn og ta den?|pg||

nt|rodvenn:  Det ble vel bet?|pg||

nt|cicus: you can see open room bidding by positioning your mouse over results top left corner if in the web client|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|zebutin: yes, with xx in @S + 11hcp could have maybe sometimes even opened, so seems reasonable to try that way|pg||
nt|sverjohn: This used to be asking for spesific aces. Apparently not in e-w system|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A par result. It is called par when both sides of the table have maximised their score|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gluckenval: ecco, non si è visto, ma dopo aver eliminato i neri avrà giocato una qualsiasi @H dal morto ed è stato basso di mano... Alfredo non ha ritorni utili|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I myself don't know how you use the web client, I use the windows client|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1@D is transfer to @H|pg||
nt|zebutin: so 2@H promising 4card support and minimum|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|cicus: here is the tournamenet website: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Veldhoven.htm|pg||

nt|johnp: Cannot see how to avoid 4 loosers |pg||
nt|pbmarstr: too aggressive|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: This contract depends on no heart loser. Ca 20 %.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: here we go|pg||
nt|ianmcc: alert shmalert|pg||
nt|cicus: unfortunately that site is updated rather slowly so you are not going to see results of other matches there very soon|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@d wiil be minorwood|pg||
mb|p!|nt|gioffi: ci credo|pg||
nt|sverjohn: A good sacrifice as North can make 5 spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn:  Han vet at Boye mÃ¥ ha ruter ess, for hvis Frode har det, er han bet, siden frode har god hjerter.|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|pbmarstr: The cards are lying well for declarer, so this will probably come home|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|pbmarstr: small club would perhaps have been a trifle better. Now Nystrøm will consider that clubs are unevenly divided|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Both pairs play strong club systems with lots of relays|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: in this hand 4-4 @D fit seems to play better, can throw couple @H to @C and ruff one @H|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't explain the 2nd X - I don't think penalties is mainstream|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: north whispered shows points|pg||
nt|cicus: S may have felt 2NT as inadequate - but his long suit won't run...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gluckenval: Alfredo sulla piccola @S di prima deve aver passato l'8 in quanto non avendo visto il 10 in sud (@SK10) necessita del doppio impasse. Non basta più il Kx....|pg||
nt|zebutin: so doesn't need to have @H K at the right side|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a finesse for @H K which is porabably rigth so good contract|pg||
nt|rodvenn:  Bluff bid by upmark?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Even vuln. this looks heavy|pg||
nt|bobholl: you can't agrue with success (it worked)|pg||
nt|bobholl: argue|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cicus: with that said, such aggressivity is normal when bidding vulnerable games|pg||
nt|ianmcc: competiton here|pg||
nt|cicus: W could bid 4@H here but what shall he do over 4@S?|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe going slowly is the right tactic|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodvenn:  1 ru er Yeslek|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree.  Looks like a 9-winner hand.  But West will drive it to slam anyway.|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So Norway strikes back, and has had a good start in both rooms actually|pg||
nt|sverjohn: A friendly lie of the cards here|pg||
nt|zebutin: that's true|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S can make 5@s, +450 is par|pg||
mb|4S|nt|zebutin: 3@C just natural invite|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|cicus: anyway, I can't see N sell out to a @H game at these colours|pg||
nt|cicus: fit showing 5@C by E|pg||
nt|cicus: meaning he wants to compete to 5@H and he has length and strength in @Cs|pg||
mb|5D|an| |nt|ianmcc: a good pressure bid, but 5@s likely|pg||
mb|5H|nt|zebutin: EW play that 1nt from 3rd&4th seat is 15-16, but could have downgraded even from 14-16nt to 1@D opening|pg||
nt|zebutin: only 9hcp against 10-15hcp opening bid, but 7th @C must be worth something|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S can't lose|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|nt|zebutin: because of flat shapde&no intermediates|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 1 @S denies 4 spades. Double is 4+|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: So it is possible to win a grand. |pg||
nt|cicus: now N is sure of a double fit so no selling out to 5@H either|pg||
nt|ianmcc: pls don't X|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gioffi: non capisco molto il 2@S di claudio con la bilanciata minima dell'apertura|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could be able to get out for -1100?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: if 3@C invite i wouldn't bid as east |pg||
nt|cicus: actually, EW are going to gain an IMP here :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pbmarstr: It is great odds for this club finesse because W has probably not EK of diamonds after the lead|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: And the grand slam is nearly as good as a small slam. You need the diamon finesse both places|pg||
nt|zebutin: some agressive players maybe would have even axed this contract with Nybos cards|pg||
nt|cicus: this is only 650|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|sverjohn: 1@h is hearts or GF relay I think|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: so far so good|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: N s bids are all relays|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sverjohn: -1400 with 3 times spades|pg||
nt|zebutin: and 3@C is surely little stretched...but I trust Upmark-Cullin know what they are doing... or something :)|pg||
nt|cicus: OR scored 690 when NS there was doubled in 4@S already|pg||
nt|cicus: hard for E to refrain from X|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|zebutin: yes. usually if missing AK from somesuit, and it isn't lead, you can think that those honors are divided and count your points from there (as simplification)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gluckenval: ho detto una fesseria sulla mano di prima...  al 5@C... se non paga picche può anche pagare la @H perchè la @S va sulla @H, se gira l'impasse. sry|pg||
nt|gioffi: 2 sotto 300|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: essensial for EW to compete to the 3-level to get the plus|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems his pass would have been a forcing pass anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sverjohn: still an imp :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c6|pc|s6|nt|cicus: which is maybe indicated with so weak @Ds|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|zebutin: or if not lead = leader doesn't have both of those|pg||
nt|zebutin: so other opponent has (not here obviously), or they are divided|pg||
nt|cicus: what he lacks is a sure @D trick|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|vugraphznz: i messed up|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: declarer ruffed a heart|pg||

pc|cA|nt|gioffi: fa più o meno 3 sotto se lo tengono|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like automatic double...short @S and surely maximum what has promised&some length on every suit...couldn't ask for more...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|zebutin: so declarer most likely ducks 1st spade|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: should duck the first spade, or else he will have to guess which ace he must remove.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pbmarstr: Now the contract should go one down|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: As predicted the two first boards was a draw.|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Grøtheim has shown 17-19. No reason for North to look further. |pg||
nt|sverjohn: Big swing to Sweden as Brogeland gives away a double game not settling for 1 down|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Where this table played 4 @D x -1, the other table played 5 @C x 11! after what looks like a misdefense from Brogeland|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems to get 8 tricks (4@H+2@C+2@S) if quesses everything right...but after that needs something good to develope...|pg||
nt|bobholl: now the 8 of @C migth play a role :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: especially if Q is unblocked (which seems quite natural thing to do)|pg||
nt|rodvenn:  But will he play south for 4 hearts when he knows clubs are long with south?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|gioffi: credo che Lorenzo sull'intervento di 1@S sia costretto a dire Passo non avendo dichiarazione probabilmente giocano il dbl solo con le @H|pg||

nt|zebutin: yes on this layout @C shift would have been deadly|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: je har tydeligvis kommentatorrettigheter her, men veit ikke om det er så viktig at je sier noe|pg||
nt|zebutin: and when Brogeland has 3 @H it makes % even stronger for finessing the Q right way|pg||
nt|cicus: BTW, 3@S set spades as trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|gioffi: ora solo @S puo battere|pg||
nt|gluckenval: con i verticali che non possono muovere le @S loro, Lorenzo ha il tempo per organizzare lo scarto delle @S |pg||

nt|cicus: now if declarer takes the @C finesse, discards a @D and leads @S10, he can make 10 tricks|pg||

nt|grebrof: motspillene har ikke akkurat sitti for disse idag  - er vel den dagen da|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pbmarstr: ANother potential slam is coming|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|zebutin: in board 5 Norway got 9 imps back, when opponents sacrificed to 5@S, and they didn't bid slam (for even more imps)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d!|nt|remo: 3nt -2 o 6@C=? :)|pg||
nt|cicus: depend much on what 4H meant - if accepted the slam try then it may have been too much|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|pbmarstr: Did he block the clubs?|pg||
nt|cicus: they are surely going to discuss that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: looks like 2 @H RD would be +1:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is cold|pg||
nt|andersk: However a @C ruff will make it 2HR=|pg||
nt|andersk: Tundal thinking about raising?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess that even with the bad minor suit breaks, the wonderful major suit positions allow 6@d to make|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: probably. Will not play 2 @H R :-)|pg||

nt|pbmarstr: If the finesse lose, the contract goes down (S playing @H)|pg||
nt|henryb:  If the finesse loses the contract is always down. He doesn't have 12 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  Even with 5 clubs, only 4@d, 5@c and two aces|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|gluckenval: 4@S sarebbe stata buona difesa, ma molto difficile da trovare|pg||
nt|remo: coffee break :)|pg||
nt|figb_rama: a 8 mani dalla fine, femminile: Reggio Emilia 243 - Catania 170|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A low scoring 16 boards with the Brogeland mistake in 5 @C doubled as the substantial contribution to the outcome.|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|pbmarstr: There is 1 IMP for taking for Grøtheim here.|pg||

nt|pbmarstr: Molberg tells me that four times clubs will squeeze S out of a heart on the last board. 3 NT was on.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: I'm not quite sure what happened in the end at board 13, but as I understood it, 9 tricks were claimed|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: Upmark in OR took the A of @D and played @S 10|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Landing on two spade losers and a diamond loser|pg||

nt|zebutin: now had quite awkward bid on 2nd round when partner pushed to level of 3|pg||
nt|rodvenn:  Difficult defense here?|pg||
nt|zebutin: declarer might have hard time if opponents just play @H suit and force him to ruff in table. making finese of Q10xx problematic...then needs to get some trump reduction/etc to make ...|pg||
nt|zebutin: it|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I was wondering about reaching 6@d on board 12. Nybo and Brogeland reached 7, but did not navigate the double dummy problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: This is the last board in this set. The next session will begin at about 15:00 local time, in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|grebrof: som vi ser var ikke 3nt noen supervinner på det andre bordet og det blir ikke kontrakten her|pg||
nt|cicus: to look for a grand|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@S wont be fun|pg||

nt|figb_rama: e a chi ci ha seguito|pg||
mb|p|nt|figb_rama: il prossimo appuntamento è per i Campionati del Mondo|pg||
nt|rodvenn:  NystrÃ¶m did|pg||
nt|zebutin: to me it wouldn't be even close... but i'm usually overbidding my cards anyway...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: depends where you are sitting|pg||
nt|cicus: even 6@C goes down on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|figb_rama: nella seconda metà di ottobre|pg||
nt|figb_rama: troverete il dettaglio degli orari nei "prossimi vugraph"|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: This is the last board in this session. The next set will begin about 15 minutes after this board is done|pg||
nt|cicus: not clear E can find it|pg||
nt|ianmcc: oh dear|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe he should have given it more time but still not easy|pg||
nt|cicus: he should have asked where 2 tricks are going to come from|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: last board of this match, thanks for watching;|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: next round will start 13:45 local time (in about an hour)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|grebrof: blir vel fort beit her og|pg||
nt|grebrof: angående rutiner ved bordet - nå tar ihvertfall Bertheau seg god tid til å tenke ut hva som er beste spilleplan - ingen dum ide|pg||
nt|rodvenn:  I think Nybo may think he needs to keep something in reserve. Boye almost bid again|pg||
pc|h4|nt|figb_rama: quando una delle formazioni italiane sarà trasmessa su Bbo, la seguiremo con una sala italiana|pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?offset=0|pg||
nt|figb_rama: il Mondiale finirà il 29 ottobre e dal 30 potrete seguire su Bbo gli Assoluti Italiani a Squadre Miste|pg||
nt|figb_rama: senza soluzione di continuità!|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  apparently 2@s showed 4@s and a longer minor|pg||
nt|andersk: this will cost|pg||
nt|andersk: 800-1100|pg||
nt|cicus: surely no 2 red tricks are cashing|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expexct less then 1% would find the @S lead|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not bid is OR Israel win by 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|cicus: Australia was extremey conservative in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: club to the king seems best, with AQx west will take the ace and play another heart to force dummy to ruff|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodvenn:  Getting the contract right-sided|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodvenn:  Not fooling Boye!|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andersk: Imo Berthau is too agressive|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see myself stop short of 6@C after a 3@C opener|pg||
nt|ianmcc: staying out of slam missing AQxx is not very extreme|pg||
nt|yuval10: for those who uses 4@d over 3@c as "kickback" it looks like working good here|pg||
nt|cicus: what I am saying is that I can't stop even if that is wrong|pg||
pc|h5|nt|grebrof: AK i @d - @s te E og @d te stjeling og @c mot K ser best ut|pg||
nt|zebutin: good lead...obviously Nybo has always some @H anyway for passing so casually and all...|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: THX all, this will be 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|frankaus: 6@D seems cold|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Fabulous shift from Nystrøm|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|andersk: 800 for sure|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cicus: depends on whether you are allowed to open on Q108xxx|pg||
mc|12|nt|johnp: Peter, this remind me about your first match from national team this year, you had a big loss at was judged down, but your team won. as we know..|pg||
nt|johnp: big loss first match|pg||
