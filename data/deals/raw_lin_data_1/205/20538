nt|gracelin: my guess is south might lead his clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: or what is called a canape lead, leasd the shorter suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: the S7 may not work so well, no declarer's S6 can stop the 4th round.|pg||
nt|gracelin: ok, this is more rational|pg||
nt|gracelin: now south's S7 will beat declarer S6 later.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but south does not know that.  on the run of Heart he needs to keep all his spades and let go the clubs.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Though China played in Bermuda Bowl many times in the 21 century, for Li and Liu, this is their first.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Li doesn't now want to play badly on his first board of the Bermuda Bowl.|pg||
nt|gracelin: from the 4th best lead, Li should know north has two cards higher than S5, which also means south cannot read that all his spades are already high after East wins SK.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: livestream shows they're bidding the next hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: hough the longer declarer thinks, the more south will know about the whole hand|pg||
nt|bebechira:  North said good lead Michael :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the latter lets you watch multiple tables -- one window per room|pg||
nt|gracelin: now DQ and a low Diamond may force declarer to guess who has CQ.  But even if he guesses wrong, 3C is still ok|pg||
nt|bebechira:  screen closed , kamil asking questions|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe for the length of the Precision 1D opening.|pg||

pc|d8|pc|cA|pc|s7|pc|d4|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: f course, declarer can also play HA to be on side and SK wrong.  In that case he will use long D to pitch spade and go down.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|cT|nt|gracelin: but East's earlier D8 may have told the story.|pg||
nt|bebechira:  sorry i lost play , i will claim at the end|pg||

nt|brolucius: Declarer finesses in spades, seeking a discard for one of his diamond losers.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: The location of the king of spades means that South does well in 3@C, but the same location means that E-W won't make 3@H|pg||

nt|brolucius: You can see what a good idea it was for North to keep the bidding alive over 2@H (which would have made). You should always be reluctant to let the opponents play at the two-level ...|pg||

nt|gracelin: China|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually unbal -- optional to open 1@C or 1@D if 5@D(332)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: seems no way to beat 4S with DK on side.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: what if Li - shifts to @D9?|pg||
nt|gracelin: East may try shift to D9, but declarer has little option but to finesse|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|gracelin: this gambit might work if declarer has 2C and 1D|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|gracelin: declarer will ruff his H, and even he gets overruff in club later, it's a natural trmp trivk|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ruff or @H?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would loser on loser  be awful play there?|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer's plan is to use H as entry to double ruffing finesse in club to eatablish a club for D discard.  Dropping CJ is a bonus|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh of course -- ruff @H|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|s3|nt|gracelin: now H ruff, cash DA, and C10 pitch a D is quite safe|pg||

mb|2H|nt|brolucius: North may respond 4@S  to his partner's one-bid. No, he has preferred 1@S.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rhelle:  And now West has a problem. 2@s is non forcing, but he has a very nice hand|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|rhelle:  He doesn't know about the wasted @h values in his partner's hand, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of auction some play 2NT by the opener as weak-strong. That allows them to show a strong 3@C rebid (by bidding 3@C) or a shapely weaker one (via 2NT).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|kit: This is interesting.  East will lead a high heart and shift to a minor.  But does he shift to the suit where he has the king, or where he doesn't?  That is what declarer will have ...|pg||
nt|kit: to judge.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S are not playing a strong 1@C system. That is probably why North did not want to make a pre-emptive 4@S response - in case his partner was strong and they could make a slam.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W has no quick entry to allow a @s thru.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rhelle:  the problem for East is communication. He can throw @cs on @h KQ, but how to get there?|pg||
nt|brolucius: When dummy has only one card in the suit led, the partner of the opening leader can give a suit preference card to suggest a switch.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: Now club ruff, heart ruff, and eventual diamond finesse will make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rhelle:  North needs to take and shift to a @c - but not sure even that is enough|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder what declarer would have done on a diamond shift|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rhelle:  the @h2 may help - Lavinthal for @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Of course, North also doesn't know that the 2@h opening was so weak in @h|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rhelle:  good switch|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi Rob and all|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hello|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes but too late I think|pg||
nt|rhelle:  no, just in time|pg||
nt|santyclz: N will think about what to ruff with on the 3rd @c, but it won't matter.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That might ddepend on whether he believed the SP signal that West had chosen to give.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the 3NT board that we watched a moment ago, the bidding and result were the same at the other table. You can check such things by hitting the MOVIE button at the bottom.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rhelle:  East can only cross with a trump|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the HQ will get ruffed|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|rhelle:  but now North can draw dummy's last trump and cash a @c|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|s2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|boedhy:  he has only 1 trump|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ah yes - silly me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think he should throw @c |pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he needs to discard, and wait until dummy is dead - South can hold up the @d 3 times|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Bauke takes second @d and plays @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  west ruffs and now e WIjs ruffs third @d and they have @h to cash...|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Kamil's 2@C is shows @C   a totally bizarre concept|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1C is the Precision strong 1C, 17+ balanced or 16+ unbalanced|pg||
nt|gracelin: East has game on his own hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5C by NS is a profitable sacrifice|pg||
nt|gracelin: and might push EW to 5H, which is down on spade elad.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a reminder that you can see players and hear commentary from Jan van Cleeff via http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|gracelin: If north bids 5C now, it's hard for East not to be pushed to 5H|pg||
mb|5C|nt|gracelin: and the natural 2C overcall will claim its voctory|pg||
mb|d!|nt|gracelin: victory|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in college we thought of writing a book "What's Going On?"  when auction around table started  1@C-2@C-3@C-5@C|pg||
mb|5S|nt|gracelin: I guess X encourages partner to bid, and pass asks for a double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: but as East, I might just bid 5H myself.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 5S has no chance with two round of club, or H ruff.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this contract opens up possibility for very nice defense|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, Heart to A, H ruff, underlead club for another ruff.|pg||

pc|cK|nt|rhelle:  so he will get excited!|pg||
nt|kit: And in fact, N-S have profitable save in 5@C, and pushing opponents to 5@H (which likely would have happened) is a big bonus|pg||

nt|boedhy:  can he ask for it?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, and he will|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@h = relay, asking for high cards|pg||

nt|boedhy:  so a good start for teh home team.|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|rhelle:  I guess that they could sign off in 5@d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  taht should be possible...|pg||

nt|rhelle:  9 tricks are of course easy once the @cQ drops|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so the NS aggressive auction looks like paying off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well it is sort of lucky offcourse on a @s lead you need that|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players would not have bid 3@C, vulnerable, worried that partner might have only 3 clubs. But you can see that making that pre-emptive bid has pushed E/W around.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is likely to have 1 honor for the bidding, if it's a @h this is a good contract.  The @sk dooms it.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Roland agrees.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It has always staggered me that so many very good players use it.|pg||
nt|kit: big advantage of Flannery is that you don't have to respond 1@S to 1@H on a 4-bagger, so opener knows it shows 5.|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|rhelle:  well ... I think Italy is very strong, especially in the absence of the alltime strong USA teams|pg||

nt|kit: which would be needed for 4@S to significantly gain over 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point.|pg||
nt|yke:  3NT is questionable to me. with a 5-3 fit you should play in spades when the long spades is the weak hand and in NT when the long spades is the strong hand|pg||

nt|boedhy:  only board 9 is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  It was bid and made at most tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention that 2@C on a passed hand should show a sound raise in partner's major was banned for years by the English Bridge Union.  They thought it allowed players to psyche ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in 3rd seat....|pg||
nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is no doubt what he is thinking about.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: Weinstein worried about a club ruff, so may play two top spades|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he plays trumps from the top and they break 3-2, he can set up the clubs, leeaving the master @SQ out. |pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|brolucius: You can see how hopeless it would have been for North to 'cover an honour with an honour'. |pg||
nt|santyclz: The bad news is the trump break.  The good news is that s didn't request a @d through.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kit: Now diamond shift and he is down.|pg||
nt|kit: Problem was he couldn't go up ace of hearts due to no entry to the club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South may hope that North started with @CKQJ.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: If North had that in clubs, North would have cashed another club at least|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: Yes, that's a good inference - one that South has missed.|pg||
nt|kit: But South failed to work it out, and a lost opportunity goes by|pg||
