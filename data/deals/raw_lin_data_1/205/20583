pc|h7|nt|xenya: if you are bidding confidently enough, you have a good chance to push non-vulnerable opponents a bit higher |pg||
nt|yuval10: it's likely that @c's are 2-2 because both defenders were in their hand once and didn't play @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps the only possible case in which it won't apply is when South has A@c singelton, and that's what makes W thinks|pg||
nt|yuval10: if South has the A@c, and he wins and play @d, then declarer has to guess, which of course is not optimal|pg||

mb|4C|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: are you allowed to say that in public?|pg||

nt|vbman: why does he ask for cl?|pg||
nt|fokal: if they are 2 aces, then the slam should be good . Since S doesn't have the K of @c and the K of @h he should have something like QJ of @d |pg||
nt|ahollan1: first key on longest suit [@D]  then on 2nd longest or highest of equal [@H]|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ritong: and a possible last swing|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mamos: the story of this match is the one big swing on Board 21|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so last board, grateful thanks to our great operator Pim, Jon for his comments and a big thanks spectators for your great feedback|pg||
mb|5D|nt|yuval10: with what looks like a good result for Israel, when 4@h is cold|pg||
nt|ritong: that would tie the match  not sure 2 imps is worth 1 VP|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder how 4@H went down in the OR|pg||
nt|ritong: relatively naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: north led a @c, ducked|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't have an indication from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: then grue draw @h A in order to avoid a possible guess later|pg||
nt|ritong: then the roof fell on him|pg||
nt|yuval10: here it looks like South would bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Americans have been a disappointment to me in this match - but quite a long way to go before the KO stages|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you can probably guess I'm wearing a broad smile at this stage Jon|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: pachtman had very good hand for hearts, but didn't realise the 7-5 distribution, looked more like 6-5 or 7-4|pg||
nt|mamos: and a few small swings mostly to Israel|pg||
nt|grebrof: thats true Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: tu nasi s¹ w 3BA, wist kierowy - musz¹ wygraæ|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow. did he ever|pg||
nt|drorp: Gino's tactic didn't work out, personally i would just blast a big diamond bid|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|ritong: no need to precise that south did not enter the bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: not many big mistakes have been made in this match - no wonder they have started well these teams|pg||
nt|drorp: last board of the match now, about an hour before the time is over|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a huge hand for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Thanks to Jon and Gary|pg||
nt|jbgood: you too, Gary:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|drorp: chagas may have found the bid that will get them to slam|pg||
nt|drorp: needs to find another bid now|pg||
nt|drorp: very tough slam to bid, based on the 10 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hardly Chagas "duty" to bid slam, but I guess S has one more bid if Chagas can dig up some @d-support|pg||
nt|mamos: Will EW pass if he bids 4@s|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Kevin was our great operator, apologies|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: that 5@C overcall is somewhat -- er -- exotic... |pg||
nt|drorp: great stuff from Chagas|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll never know|pg||
nt|drorp: passing the 4 level, impressive|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree - very good bid|pg||
nt|drorp: 6@D coming now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lechcold: dziwny rebid Yokoi (2@S zamiast 1BA)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ryskiel_: karo - wróg bez atu!|pg||
nt|grebrof: its hard with no aces|pg||
nt|drorp: woahh i didn't expect that|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeszcze dziwniejsze 3@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s now ( more likely than @d ) means 4 off|pg||
nt|jfanha: vão perder 16-14 em vez de ganharem 18-12...acontece aos destemidos barrativos desta vida...|pg||
nt|drorp: partner went over 4 level, how can he not have 2 aces|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lechcold: po karowym te¿ wychodzi|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ryskiel_: ale trzeba na co zagraæ|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale jest palcówka rozgrywkowa -jeli kara s¹ 5-3- trzeba trafiaæ piki|pg||
nt|lechcold: mamy zatem ³adne zwyciêstwo..punkty bardzo siê przydadz¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: wczorajsze mecze nr 2 i 3 nieco nas zaniepokoi³y...nie gralimy z potentatami a mecze przegrane|pg||

pc|d9|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: West could never imagine South bidding 5@c with 6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|dT|nt|yuval10: and who can blame him...|pg||
nt|ritong: saving at least 1 Vp|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
