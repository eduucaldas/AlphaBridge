nt|roswolf: another good result for India|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: W / S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: about 3@h bid and explanation; it was only alerted for E, not for W|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it is sour grapes and e/w are trying to win back the board in the appeals room|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 4@s was 1 down|pg||
