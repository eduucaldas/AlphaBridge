nt|athene: italy have been very impressive so far|pg||
nt|athene: and lauria-versace aren't exactly anyone's idea of a third pair :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: welcome everybody|pg||
nt|gracelin: H all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Lian and Dhi is the natural pair in the Chinese team.  Bocchi also play natural with variable 1NT range|pg||
nt|gracelin: we sstart the match with a slam hand.  6S is cold and 7S on the D finesse which works.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy is now lying first comfortably with an average of 24 VP in the first 4 round.  China lies 13th at moment.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2 c is 54 11-15, qualsiasi rever senza 3|pg||
mb|2D!|an|8+ if 4H FG|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|an|4H 5D GF|nt|gracelin: 2d must be a relay and 2H probably shows 5D/4H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|4th suit |mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT was slightly ambitious.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had an obvious raise with that splendid heart suit.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|gracelin: the later round of bidding is not explained in their CC so we will have to take some guess.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6S is more comfortable a contract than 6D.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|gracelin: since they are in GF tempo, mabe south will rebid is spade suit and get a raise on the way to 6S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|an|cuebid H and 1 or 3kc i think|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|brolucius: East tries to slip through a 9th trick in diamonds. |pg||
nt|brolucius: By leading the jack, pretending to finesse against the Q, he aims to catch South asleep. Not today!|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: so the 4NT might be Turbo, showing odd numbers of key-card, in the meantime cue in H.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6D will go down if it's East hold that K10xx in trumps.  |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mathat: Q @c lead 3 r  @h|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: declarer may have a guess at the end whether West has 3 or 4 cards heart.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|gracelin: I presume he will discard the losing club on 3-round of H.  But he smply takes the trump finesse.|pg||

nt|nickf: to start the match - you need to click on REDEAL down the bottom|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: The ended in an slightl inferior slam and the cards ae not forgiving|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: NS play strong club, UDCA|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: No percentage in North entering the bidding.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ... and North has then protected with a take-out double.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: bocchi looking sy west cards on board 1|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|gracelin: trying to see how he could make the slam :)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|athene: EW play standard short club, 5-card majors, strong notrump|pg||
nt|gracelin: West will bud to 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|brolucius: East has bid 2@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5H will be very expensive at this Vul.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rensph:  As most of you will have noticed these names do not match the countries playing - I'm sure operator will get to that in a second|pg||
nt|rensph:  seems we're back and good to go. :) Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 down|pg||
mb|5S|nt|gracelin: but often the opponents will not believe they are given a gift|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|brolucius: When the opponents find a fit and then stop at the two level, the other side know that the points are divided and that they will likely have a fit somewhere.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: declarer needs to guess trump to make this, but I am afraid he will not.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mathat: @c is 2-2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|gracelin: from the 5H bid and the double, it's likely that north has a singleton trump|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gracelin: how can he believe north bids 5H at unfav Vul. with this 5422 hand.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer finesses in spades, seeking a discard for one of his diamond losers.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: The location of the king of spades means that South does well in 3@C, but the same location means that E-W won't make 3@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after all, north only bid 2H in first round.  So maybe declarer will figure it out.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will have to finish this and re start to link with other table so after this hand ill close this|pg||
nt|gracelin: got it|pg||

nt|rhelle:  hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This room will be shut down shortly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: moment of truth. he would love to finesse the SJ but entry is not cnvenient|pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the first time Lian plays for China.  His partner Shi is a veteran and reach semi-final in the 2009 BB|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|rhelle:  NS had a relay sequence, where North asked South questions about his distribution and strength|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|sT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see what a good idea it was for North to keep the bidding alive over 2@H (which would have made). You should always be reluctant to let the opponents play at the two-level ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in a fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he's on the wrong track|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|mathat: think bocchi in vuln bid 5 with sngl @s|pg||
nt|gracelin: south cannot hace a singleton club, or he would lead one for the ruff, so the finesse is to play south for 3-5-3-2 very unlikely since north is raising 2H with 6|pg||
