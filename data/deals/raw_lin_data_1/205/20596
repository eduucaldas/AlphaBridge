mb|p|nt|stoffers: Hi all|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S would be off, losing 2@H+@S+@C=4 tricks for the defence.|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|lml: especially because he has a nice way to get out in 2@d|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: does 1@h show a 4 card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes, was the answer, normally|pg||

nt|lml: north=south have a heart ruff here|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT was balanced showing less than a strong notrump|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that's why it was asked, also if spade suit could be there|pg||

mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|5S|nt|jaapfr: 6@H can go down but unlikely x@D x@C:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 6 hearts is a good contract... needs a los dia lead and a club ruff tobeat|pg||
nt|roswolf: what's wrong with 6@H IN PRACTICE??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nothing:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: but south can expect partner NOT having a spade entry once they bid the slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: very tough defence to break it with east declarer|pg||
mb|6H|nt|tomi2: maybe he can work out that this is the only way|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s will take insurance surely|pg||
nt|tomi2: fredin of course needs to be awake to take his queen once a small dia is lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure 1 out of 1000 will lead x@D kibs imo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 6@S |pg||

nt|desinka: hi David|pg||
mb|5H|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desita :)|pg||
nt|desinka: the best one.. but lets see the contract..|pg||

nt|lechcold: skok Martensa bezkompromisowy, ale mo¿e wepchn¹æ EW w szlemika, którego po³o¿enie wymaga..sami widzicie czego:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H is not making but in this vul it is hard for N to let it go|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: live scores under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|lml: of course a double by north-south would have worked well but that was hard to do|pg||
nt|ady: tht there may be a problem|pg||
nt|lechcold: decyzja Jassema ca³kowicie zrozumia³a|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêdzie bardzo tanio|pg||
nt|lechcold: a wist @D2 to hazard straszliwy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: Apparently they were not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: anybody see anyway to double 4@S?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|star6ija: assuming that 3@cs establishes GF, 3@h maybe sounds more or less natural|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ron_sc2002: nice play|pg||
nt|lml: no peeking!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they know ... now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||
nt|star6ija: I like Martel's way of bidding|pg||
nt|stoffers: Loosing a couple of diamonds and maybe one spade here, more coffee :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: so far canada has been the aggressor and it has worked|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: yes, certainly Martel could have bid 3@S rather than 3@D, but they should have survived.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|s5|nt|lml: they stole the contract on board 2 in 2@D|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: and here they pushed north-south too high|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s8|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 6 @c .....|pg||
nt|lml: West will likely open a weak 2 in spades|pg||
nt|udo: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would open 2@C with east's hand for sure|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: then south might try 3@C maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Udo and wlc :)|pg||
nt|udo: i am at work, but will try to comment sometimes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would be 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: E hand is 3 loosers|pg||
nt|lml: he decided his spades were too weak for that|pg||
nt|udo: 3@D = inverted,,weak raise with good support,,quite common agreement nowadays|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||
nt|lml: a matter of style|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
nt|lechcold: tym razem 1@C Wujotowy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is maybe inverted minor and 2N showing 15-17?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1N 18-20|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Same lead in the OR.|pg||
nt|wild card: hi|pg||
nt|wild card: this looks like a makebale contract|pg||
nt|wild card: *makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphznv: bulgaria scored 10 on the slam hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i would have overcalled 1@H with the north hand but pass is ok if your partner is there for you with a double|pg||
nt|kemperg: the only lossing line?|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: lol|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ron_sc2002: agree.. partner probably wont bid again so better to make pressure on E and bid directly 5@C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: would all of you have got to 6@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tricky too bid|pg||
nt|lml: it sure is|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|athene: north might have intended 4@C to say "you can save in 5@C if you like"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: an established partnership like the Herbst have it easier because they know what to expect from each other|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: played on @S and @H 3/2. |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|wild card: but when you try to ruff your diamonds you only need spades 3/2 and diamonds 5/3|pg||

nt|athene: bocchi-madala play quite an active game so i would not be surprised if bocchi bids 5@C in that same position|pg||
nt|athene: a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|kemperg: seeing bears on the road|pg||
nt|lechcold: atak atutowy spod trzeciej dziesi¹tki winien zasugerowaæ Martensowi, ¿e w innych kolorach Upmark ma niewygodne do wistu konfiguracje|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak mi sie wydaje|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 5@C bid would win 4 imps and maybe more if EW will bid to the 5 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||
nt|wild card: on fleisher's line of play, he would probably only have succeeded if spades were 3/2|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: 2@s+5@ss+4@cs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 7-10hcp|pg||

nt|wild card: or 4/1 with the 4card with the 3 trumps|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: in the Open Room they did start with a weak 2 using multi ... that may have made it a bit harder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S were 3/2, you mean @Hs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 2@C is both majors by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: duboin giving his partner quite a bit of leeway for 2@C at favourable|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 2@H is a fine contract|pg||
nt|lml: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 2/3@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: more than 13|pg||
nt|lml: on the finesses|pg||
nt|wild card: I mean if hearts were 3/2 and spades 4/1 he would have also gone down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|garden2005: zdaje siê, ¿e matematyczna lekko wiêksza szansa zawiod³a (> o @dJx)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: but his @DQJ are not going to be much use facing shortage|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: likely 11 tricks with nice lay of diamonds and spade split|pg||
nt|stoffers: Einarson with a huge hand after whats shown here, i would rather bid 3@s than 3@d|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: with 33 HCP most pairs should reach a slam somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: maybe all|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|lml: needing a club finesse you really dont want to be in the grand but ...|pg||
nt|ady: nice cheap trick to begin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yet to see a routine game hand:)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|lml: so south knows they are off the @CQ from the keycard response|pg||
nt|udo: @D discard?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|stoffers: But, bad splits and game not making today- quite lucky for him|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: as expected, bocchi bid 5@C and reaped a large reward|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely ruff and would bank on @D finesse, whick is correct.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: from south 6@C is better |pg||
nt|lml: with the @SQ protected|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: and the defence made the same to beat 5@H|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|nt|lml: as the cards lie of course nothing can hurt a grand|pg||

nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: transfer to @C.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
mb|3H|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||

mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Only lived in Denmark last 31 years, being an Icelander|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||

pc|s3|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: i do not understand.... :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
nt|wild card: by staying somewhat lower, south africa gained 3 IMPs, getting the lead in this match|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@H a likely contract for NS and makeable as the cards are placed.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||

mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||
nt|stoffers: Duboin knowing about a diamondlooser now (no 4@d)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: czy Volva produkowane pzrez Szwedów s¹ te¿ sztuczn¹ metod¹ robione?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D=a) some game interest  b) mild slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South writing explanations|pg||
nt|ady: 2 level high enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H would be strong game interest, nothing about @H|pg||

nt|star6ija: but they are going to be back shortly as far as I know Aronov - Stefanov simpathy to the higher levels|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but it was me who did not notice that on the king of diamonds \e played the ten |pg||
nt|ady: diamonds played for declarer by defence  so an overtrick last hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: maybe he played the Jack of Diamonds instead of 9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: the reason that the slam works is that north-south dont have quacks they have controls|pg||

nt|antoniz: 140|pg||
nt|lechcold: z tak cienkimi numerkami pikowymi nie ka¿dy zdecydowa³by siê na skok w tych za³ozeniach|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphznv: they like to play with 6 trumps i think|pg||
pc|c3|nt|udo: this lead helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  that 1N was 9-12|pg||
nt|star6ija: they reached the worst possible contract...even 3N has greater chances|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lechcold: Fredin na drugim stole tego nie zrobi³|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wild card: well, you already have told you're low on points, and you'll never make your hearts in a spade contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: some play re-double in east seat compels 2@C  which east would pass with what he had  or if a higher suit would then bid his suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have 3 ranges for 1N   at fav  1/2=9-12  3/4=11-14  otherwise 15-17|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|udo: still,,,9 tricks ,,hmm,,,,may need some endplay|pg||
nt|athene: will he try finessing the @S9 for a dummy entry?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|udo: i see only 7 tricks actually|pg||
nt|famus: that 1 imp is becoming more illusive with each passing board--sounds like poetry!!:)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|nt|athene: @SK there was safe, wasn't it? i guess not if east had @SQ109xx, but is that really possible?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ehsana: hello all :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|lml: so probably 4|pg||
nt|lml: and likely a push or an imp in it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphznv: a spade to the @s J|pg||
nt|athene: lauria decides to give up on the heart finesse since it might be wrong anyway and even if right, very hard to get to take it twice|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EA--can u tell us who was their coach--i forget the name??|pg||
nt|athene: even if the @S10 is onside|pg||
nt|ehsana: Kokish's  reps in Karachi|pg||
nt|famus: ah ok--ther are people looking here for those reps:))haha--joking|pg||
nt|athene: if the hearts are breaking, then it is advantageous to cash them|pg||
nt|star6ija: how he will go probably wrong|pg||
nt|ady: can make   ruff high and draw   and play on either red suit  |pg||
nt|star6ija: I think chances are greater for ruffing with the 8 here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fingers on the ten...not on the table|pg||
nt|ady: have to guess|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: to take some exit cards away from the defence and make them discard|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d5|nt|famus: with two entries it wud've fetched him more to return @hs--but Lauria does it for him|pg||
nt|ehsana: hink Lauria is giving all up|pg||
nt|athene: but if they aren't breaking, cashing them just sets up a trick or tricks for a defender|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finesse @ss now|pg||
nt|udo: @S to 9 and still interesting|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: guessed right    though perhaps a little luck;y|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, but ... if W has 4 trumps with 9 promotion is already done|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||

nt|skaftij:  rathe heavy 3@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lechcold: 1@C Wujotowy|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: NS play multi - maybe he thinks that hand is too strong for weak-two but too weak for 1@S|pg||
nt|wild card: board 10, EW in the open room also bid 4@h, got a diamond lead, declarer misguessed trumps but still got home after a wrong defence|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|wild card: south apparently wants to know whether to play 3NT or 4@s, and that's an easy decision for north|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Natural 4@S but appears difficult to make on J@D lead.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: think this will end in game|pg||
nt|ady: not slam|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wild card: 3@h conventional, I've seen Americans do that before|pg||
nt|wild card: with both @dA and @cK offside, he will go down|pg||
nt|wild card: and 3NT might be made|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lechcold: ten Grue jest bardzo grony|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphznv: it did|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: he is trying for the crossruff but it wont work for him|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: west might have pushed with 5@C   and taken a view if east cu 5@D|pg||
nt|wild card: he can discard 3 clubs now|pg||
nt|wild card: but after @d10, I doubt he will depend on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: przepraszam, priv:) ale Joe Grue, naprawdê jest grony|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|ady: premature Q@C|pg||

nt|wild card: probably he will have to|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: as if @C ever get any respect  now they're premature|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: the good news is that the long hand is overrufing the spades|pg||
nt|lml: so he will probably come to the diamond 9 eventually for 7 tricks|pg||

nt|ady: double squeeze now|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: [sorry  or unbal 5+@C 15+ HCP]   1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ritong: not mentioning @h Kxx, always a small problem to hold Hxx in other major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i forgot Martel was allowed to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, NS system in the other room put west on lead against the slam, so japan didn't get their imp |pg||
mb|3D|nt|skaftij:  But not likely to go beyond 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: the cards lie very well for north-south|pg||
nt|ehsana: DBL was nota good option ??|pg||
nt|wild card: this will probably force p to bid 4@s, he will ask for keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: will west offer notrumps, or just bash in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he surely must bid SOME game, with a good 17 count facing drury|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: why not?|pg||
nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: curiously  most tables will have identical auction even though very different inferences|pg||

pc|sA|nt|famus: i think it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and @h K might be a falsecard with KJx|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S has a chnace now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer will make this one - is my guess|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
nt|lechcold: 130 i -2 impy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wild card: probably he wasn't considering anything else than 6@s, but east had some questions about the auction or kept the tray for a couple of seconds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No play, can cash a @C otherwise make 7.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
pc|d2|nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now, it be even go 2 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will surely ditch a @h|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: best for declarer to play 2nd round of clubs from east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank now|pg||

nt|skaftij:  2 times @c|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
nt|athene: south has a pretty nice 12; he might just invite|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|athene: of course if west doubles a 2@H transfer that might alter things|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next session will be at 16.45 hours..|pg||
nt|athene: but they play 2-way stayman over the mini notrump|pg||
nt|athene: and no transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N back |pg||
nt|lml: no big deal when you have nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last board now // Hope you all enjoyed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board now|pg||
nt|ady: final hand of the session    thx all    thx specs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Einarsson decided quickly not to finesses @h, queen being more likely with South and ruff pending|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final board of match at our table    3rd/final session of the day scheduled to begin in about 1 hour|pg||
mb|1D|nt|skaftij:  This is the last match today|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: now south has the choice of 2@S, weak takeout|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@C "weak stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL = 4 or 5 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H for e/w looks the spot|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|skaftij:  Thank you all kibs for good comments, I was not able to bring all forwards |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
nt|skaftij:  thanks to our magnificent operator|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bob|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match. Thanks to our operator Natalia and specs for watching some absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big win on last board expected for Swedes|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziwny splinter|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwny|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 5@D can then only 3 imps win|pg||
nt|lechcold: miejmy nadziejê, ¿e nie bêdzie nieporozumienia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3NT jest dobre|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly    nust know I would like a cup of tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 1@C includes weak NT as well as some strong hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx all for watching|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks, last board for the day here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@c must show @d and @s|pg||
nt|wild card: Last board of this match. Next round will start at 13:45 local time (in somewhat more than an hour)|pg||
nt|wild card: is that correct Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Think so.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why East bid 4@H instead of 1@D transfer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry in Polish dzien dobry|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tough to find the slam|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzienn dobry:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzien:)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
nt|ady: because I want my cup of tea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol ...for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming weat holds weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weat???   that was supposed to be weSt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  Levin in 6@S East|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that will be worth some imps to usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that after Stefanov opened 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south stil thinking ...do not go away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room  "Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicker. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S""|pg||
nt|ady: play of 6@S easier after £@C opening|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we will restart in 50 mins from now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Daily Bulletin always shows the lineup of vugraph matches for the day   http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp?redirect=1&|pg||

nt|wild card: swift surrender by NS|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@D ³atwo mo¿na po³o¿yæ|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Could make 3NT, 6@D+1@C+2@S=9.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: how do you allocate it?|pg||
nt|lml: we have "both|pg||
nt|lechcold: @CA - lavinthal pikowy i dalej wiadomo|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lechcold: a i bez tego nie ma jak tego graæ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes would be beauty @CA x@S @C for down 1|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwne decyzje obu naszych graczy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie sympatyzujê ze Splinterem z rêk¹ S....kompletnie nie sympatyzujê|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jassem chyba pomylil sie w systemie|pg||
nt|antoniz: ja te¿ nie|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Martens zrozumial 3@s jako splinter @h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: the light overcall drives to the wrong lead, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't know what 4@c meant, maybe finding best denomination|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: and Lindop|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: and Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: votes each way|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeli to tak mia³o byæ, to jednak nie bêdê wkuwa³ systemu M-J:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: yes the 2NT bid was a killer|pg||
nt|lml: I think west is more to blame myself|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they would have played the double of 2NT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@C fit for at least 1 with good hand |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Jonsson had the chance to defeat, just missed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30 OR|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|lml: if you play 3@S is not forcing maybe you could but that is hard|pg||
pc|d6|nt|harmon: .|pg||
pc|dA|nt|harmon: Baxter has clear 3h bid competition in spades|pg||
nt|harmon: 3s is forcing|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: versace plays the @DQ to make it look as though he has nothing in diamonds in hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: still, Bocchi-Madala should wander into this game without much trouble|pg||
nt|lechcold: mecz skoñczy siê 16:14 dla nas|pg||
nt|lechcold: wynik chyba lepszy niz gra|pg||
nt|lechcold: i jak na historiê naszych potyczek ze Szwedami  -ca³kiem niez³y|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|ady: safety play in hearts   make sure not to lose finesse to stiff king|pg||

pc|h5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thanks all see you back in 1 1 /2 hour ca.|pg||
nt|ritong: now he can determine that north has singleton @s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|udo: but with @c 3-3 , no need to find @S queen|pg||
nt|ritong: with 5@h presumably, 4@ds and 3 @cs if he tests the suit, what he certainly will do|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after he cashes the clubs, the spade guess won't present a problem|pg||
nt|lechcold: B-N zagrali poprawnie na drugim stole|pg||
nt|lechcold: tutaj posz³o ze 30 impów:(|pg||
