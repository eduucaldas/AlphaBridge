mb|p|nt|gluckenval: Fantunes's system is a conv. one... they didn't change their agreements since 2001 more or less :) any opening bids at level 1 is usually 14+ (with ecceptions), 1NT weak 12-14 with ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 5M too, and the openings bid at level 2 are in the range 10-13|pg||

nt|paulg:  with Roland and Bill|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Both methods have  plusses and minuses.|pg||
nt|paulg:  which, with all due respect, is not as intimidating as doing it with Larry Cohen|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|hantveit: probably 1nt-p-2kl-p-2h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Zmud99: of course Piekarek didn't open 3@D|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|stoffers: good lead, down now as declearer played 'safe' |pg||
nt|santyclz: That seemed more likely until the continuations.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bjr à tous|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c2|pc|dA|nt|psyck: we seem to be missing the auction other room, but it cannot have been as good as here anyway|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|penseur9: bonjour|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|pc|dT|nt|penseur9: playing low spades to try and prevent declarer to go to dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup: shortage of entryes made this +1 and it looks very normal|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hantveit: anyones guess|pg||
nt|santyclz: It looks as if we're in for some imaginative bidding this round.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ace to prevent the overtrick.|pg||
nt|hantveit: well, the good thing is that this gives us action already from the start. they stopped in a normal 1N in closed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: it is about a 30.5% slam|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe 2H was a kind of TO ? but I have to emit, i have never heard about such a thing before|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  EW had good sacrifice here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone|pg||

nt|penseur9: great defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hantveit: 6h is on withouth club lead|pg||
nt|hantveit: 20-10 points, so should stop|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H N/S seems the max here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|stoffers: Nunes had to have exactly doubleton for playing the ace to be wrong, + 0-3@h ofcource. Unlucky by Gromov!|pg||
nt|gluckenval: about the lead of the italians, they have a 3 pages of supplementary sheets for their slavinsky leads... i.e. with 83 the lead is rev. (small from 2 cards)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but not in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  awkward hand for North .. 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  my request to be flown out to the warmer climes of Monaco has been refused, but still a pleasure to see some world-class players|pg||

mb|2D|nt|psyck: @d for no loser was about 62% & of course need @s fin...|pg||
nt|psyck: for 1 loser i meant|pg||
nt|stoffers: declearer will have some pressure on 5 rounds of spades, and need to find the Q@c to make this|pg||
nt|hantveit: but if we look on lousers, there is 12 tricks. (24-8-4=12 tricks)|pg||
nt|hantveit: losers|pg||
nt|santyclz: 12 tricks in @hs, unfortunately e-w have 2 first.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2@h is constructive here, so EW probably play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 20:20 HCP both sides and likely NT.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Hello|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts and another, Bill?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  W has to find @d switch now|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, if they take it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not any more.|pg||
nt|penseur9: lookis like 4 loosers here|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: the last CC we have for NS is : http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c is a little precipitous|pg||
nt|hedyg: they have made some changes since..|pg||
nt|hedyg: no CC for EW|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back Hedy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed for the contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: they are from Genova, Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Paul :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3NT would probably have been the choice of most, second choice 3@s|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Rankings before last match : 1) White House 137  2) Bonori  136  3) Zimmermann 133  4) De Botton 129  5) Patane 126  6) Italia School 124  7) GIB 121  8) Ward Platt 120  9) Corsica ...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 120  10) Brondi  116    Top 6 teams qualify for Quarter Final tomorrow ( plus 2 teams from Patton B )|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup: some chancce for -2 now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the match is very close, so each and every imp counts|pg||
nt|hantveit: a wash, and next|pg||
nt|kjadams: close game here.   Spade lead should scuttle it.|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi CK and John-wlc|pg||
nt|kjadams: Thanks ara|pg||
nt|kjadams: 1 imp for Bonori on 1st when declarer opted for a heart finesse rather than a double squeeze.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Both lines look close to even money|pg||
nt|paulg:  Nunes also senses problems for them|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I guess H and another, or H + minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  i wonder if double was not penalty, as South looks too strong for 3@s opposite a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hervé!|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Hervé|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 3 world champions at table|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: work on minors or ruff @h?...|pg||
nt|kjadams: this hand, I can't see any line to avoid a loser in each suit, so down 1 will be best case, and down 2 seems possible.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not the best lead on this hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gluckenval: cut & paste from their leads... i.e.: K6532 = 2; K653 = 6; 9832 = 2; 983 = 9; 92 = 2;|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but I don't count|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2 in NS....and 1 is operating :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: Fantoni can tell from the bidding that they have a fit problem|pg||
nt|penseur9: if you don't Roland... where do I stand :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Standings after Round 8/9 : 1) Gladysh 140  2) Zimmermann 138  3) White House 138  4) Ventin 122  5) Marill 120  6)  Vainikonis E  117  7) De Botton 114  8) Welland  112  9)  ...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Vainikonis  110  10 ) Zaleski  88    First 2 will play a final of 3X16 tomorrow |pg||
nt|runnerup: west has already shown 1 ace -so time to give ruff -wd|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fantoni can also see the @sAK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator is?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psyck: most lines work here...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Nathalie Frey is operating :)  Venice cup winner in Estoril :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: fantastic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sex change operation? it reads Frederic in his/her profile|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 hearts and 4+ in a minor|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Zmud99: yes but it's false|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: well, that is by the way|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7@D would seem to be on here.  I don't know if it's biddable but 6 seems like a good shot.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d5|nt|hantveit: next hand is interesting...|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  your bets? 4@d vs 4@s? higher stakes?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I'm a 4 bidder both ways...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even 5@d with indicated @s lead look quite fine|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, they play real bridge, not double dummy|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hantveit: a cold seven as we can see, they stopped in closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: 2 @c and 2 @s -3|pg||

nt|hantveit: 2H is a bit weak for my taste|pg||
nt|santyclz: 16 top tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: @D ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 losers only, strong suit, and a H in partners suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: kalispera Manos :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H relay, at least invitational|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam possible here I'd think|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Remember that the 1@s bid by Nunes shows a good hand.  Lessor hands are opened 2@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: hard to plat 3NT when opps bid 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 10-13, unbalanced|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ybob: play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|runnerup: 4 @d is a winner -but you cant bid it anymore|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 10-13 (good 9) 5+.|pg||
nt|stoffers: bad splits here, but will bring home 10 tricks easy|pg||
nt|gluckenval: obviously, in 3rd seat and not Vul they are undisciplined :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: should North take control of the bidding here?|pg||
nt|kjadams: Spades will make 3 or 4 here.   Club suit frozen, but tough to arrange a pitch.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|hantveit: still, they should be able to find it now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is like the previous hand ... North has all the wrong cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And this will go down a large number of 50's ... should East have hit it?|pg||
nt|penseur9: the dealer must be as tired as the players at this hour :)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H might have made|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  Some pairs rebid 1NT with the West hand, but never in France |pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup: the moment of truth|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Drum-roll, please...|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks to go -1 ok|pg||

nt|ybob: for that was better bid 4@D over 3NT|pg||
nt|hantveit: 7H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many people who play 2/1 reserve a 3@h rebid on this auction for a solid suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: if partner holds xxx in dia, it is still a 52% chance to make. dia 2-2 or dia q drop|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Tez :) welcome|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: I don't think he can double 3@D, partner did not have to be this strong|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hantveit: might bid 6d on the way|pg||
nt|hantveit: wereas Multon will be given the honor to bid 7H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  not without risk of course|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|santyclz: With the @H10 and @cace onside and the j dropping this should make an overtrick.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hantveit: north might be afraid a pas on 6D...|pg||
nt|santyclz: @h q|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's problem here is that west can get in with the @CA and draw a third round of trumps|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stoffers: Well judged by Gromov to double the third time (pass forcing), if he had passed i am sure dubinin had bid once more. That said 5@d or 5@h is very unlucky not to make|pg||
nt|gluckenval: def. borderline... I really don't like so much when I'm going 3 off... I think a good sacrifice bid should be for 1-2 off, no more|pg||
nt|stoffers: well, this is 2 off|pg||
nt|stoffers: Needed club-club lead and ricing with A@s to get it three down, tough to do that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I agree ... too tight at imps|pg||
nt|kjadams: The term "frozen" means neither side can lead the suit without sacrificing a trick.|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi william|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|stoffers: -3 now i guess|pg||
nt|stoffers: Short of trumps, good defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think East was in a more difficult position, tough to overcall 2NT with the source of tricks destroyed|pg||
nt|hedyg: as they say cinquanta il pezzo|pg||
nt|ady: caash out job|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: Well done.|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this auction 3NT clearly stands no chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good result for NS in the CR.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  i don't think I've ever said that|pg||
nt|hedyg: never played against Italians?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they know my limitations|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mathat: thinking to retern @d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And as it's turned out, probably very difficult for the defence to find the way to beat this three tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Basically West at some point had to cash the 3 major suit tops, and get out with @CJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h4|nt|athene: but the @DJ comes down with only one diamond ruff so all should be ok|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gluckenval: now @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  but on a less descriptive auction you'd prefer to be in 3NT than 5@d|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|penseur9: there you go :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: Good defense|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  sorry, i missed the highly favourable spade layout here that makes 3NT makeable|pg||
nt|tez: wd.nice defence|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, two tricks slid away ...|pg||
nt|penseur9: loks like -1|pg||
nt|athene: interestingly, even if east had had another diamond and one fewer spade he would still have been stuck because he has to guard all three side suits|pg||
mc|13|nt|ady: cheap|pg||

nt|hantveit: a better feeling now for NS, but can they really believe 7H is not a wash?|pg||
nt|penseur9: this may cost a few IMPs here|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very |pg||
nt|rnmalik: positive no @C and 9 tricks only.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psyck: a hand that only Roland would find interesting here|pg||
nt|ybob: slam time ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: i agree -4 @d -for lead ,but can you think about lead against 4nt in that |pg||
mb|1H|nt|penseur9: oups... same at other table :(|pg||
nt|kjadams: the other table shifted to clubs vs game which gave up the extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: i guess if one pair stops in 2@H and the other reaches 3@H, it's just that the pair in 3 loses imps sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: 5 imps for stopping low on board 2.|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Duplication error on board 3 - we will go to board 4|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hantveit: anoth biggy here|pg||
nt|hantveit: but as noone is holding a longer suit, it is harder to bid it.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i have more confidence in them reaching 3NT this time|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ybob: of course not|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hantveit: it should not be bid either I think... what do you guys mean?|pg||
nt|hedyg: N wishing she had made a bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: like 1@s|pg||
nt|kjadams: Could have led clubs once, but not twice, if lead Q.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: for 2 reasons...|pg||
nt|tez: if they play 1@c 1@d 1NT(May have 4 card major) ...they could stop in 3 NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: on  2, the CR in 2@H +2 for 7 IMPs Las Girafes|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: 4@s was one off if Dubinin played @h at an early stage, 5@c is makable because K@c is always single :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: seven is only on if no club lead, trumphs breaking 3-2 and heart 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  strong @c in action - E is entitled to bid knowing partner has 17+|pg||
nt|runnerup: now west will overbid -yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry was checking why 3NT was -3 last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if 1@s is diamonds or 3 controls?|pg||
nt|kjadams: interesting 3S call here.|pg||
nt|kjadams: quite strong and with a side 4 card major.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|caruga: un numerone|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kjadams: 2S here looks like a transfer to clubs, with 2N showing an accept of a club game invite.|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, that was the only swingy hand with the slams & games on other boards being fairly strightforward|pg||
nt|kjadams: 10 tricks for the taking with the club Q dropping.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough hand this one ... 5@C is the spot, NOT 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: *les...|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C unlucky for e/w   spade ruff|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody's 4@s.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gluckenval: 5@C makable only playing @CK stiff.... hard to find laso after the dbl |pg||
nt|gluckenval: also|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no miracle happens here, I suppose|pg||
nt|stoffers: The lead indicates sout to have AKQ there...|pg||
nt|stoffers: i bet he gets it right|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nunes should have played the A@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer realized 4@s is one off, but how it helps him with guessing @c right?|pg||
nt|stoffers: WQell, he doesnt know its off, because @h could be 4-2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, void in @c makes 4@s palyable, too|pg||
nt|stoffers: But he has a strong indication to play North for the exact hand now, he needs those highcardpoints to have a t/o double|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|runnerup: i think this was a good guess |pg||
nt|gluckenval: if South has really AKQ, North sould have the others hcp ... North vul. doesn't bid dbl with 10 hcp, better wait dbl from p |pg||
nt|hedyg: unfortunately we have no system card or CC for EW|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, so no game makes ... VERY tough hand :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Tomorrow we will start broadcasting at 14.03|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How about 4@S?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No 4@S is hopeless.  Everything is hopeless|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Their best chance is probably to get to 5@C and hope that the defence mis-steps|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  can in fact make    diamonds can be ruffed out  king an extra discard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think it can ... there aren't enough entries.  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: likel make now with no @H ruff.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: likely|pg||
nt|kjadams: The zimmerman team has been one of the top teams in the world in the last couple years.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good hand on which to get a coffee.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gluckenval: should|pg||
nt|runnerup: east was very active (aggressive-if you want .bidding 2 @s)|pg||
nt|kjadams: The are a threat to win any event they have entered.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to decide who has the long diamonds; if north has them, you hold up since the heart finesse is into south|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  I should admit, @s position appeared very unlucky for declarer - both honours offside|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, i spoke too soon|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: 1...as it is his fav 20-20....2nd) as it can occasion his unfav 'f' conv by north|pg||
nt|santyclz: Only 11 top tricks. |pg||
nt|hantveit: that is a 0,25X0,68x0,53 % (plus stiff spade j)|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think 5 in spades, 4 i dia, 2 in H and one in C|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|runnerup: no science -so that even if 2 @s are off -who guesses to lead that|pg||
nt|paulg:  they could have played in 3NT anyhow ... 3@d with @dxxx was not a great description of the hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe there are ... I'll take that back|pg||
pc|hK|nt|penseur9: fortunatly 3NT is a south lead, might have a chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, they've reached a reasonable contract, but of course Nunes was not going to lead a spade into a bid and raised suit|pg||
nt|ady: take 8 tricks cheapest|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: now north may shift to a spade|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gluckenval: here we are...|pg||
nt|stoffers: very important trick coming up..|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes ofcause in good day you can meke this |pg||
nt|penseur9: with a @S return might promote a 9th... I'm a born optimist :)|pg||
nt|athene: he needs his partner to have an entry and some tricks somewhere - spades or clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, I need more caffeine!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sfoxa:  I'm tempting to approach the table and see Dubinin'd eyes|pg||

nt|stoffers: Wd|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh. yes!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|paulg:  my kibitzers are certain that 1@s is conventional, even if they cannot agree on the specific meaning|pg||
nt|penseur9: are we seing the right bidding here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are, they overbid a little|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: Yes...|pg||
nt|penseur9: this contract a a slight chance but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would not make either|pg||
nt|penseur9: will Fantoni lead trump here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done by Angelini to make 5@D|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he got a heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then easier, spade lead much better for the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North did not overcall in the other room, a bit strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How much does one need to overcall I wonder|pg||
nt|penseur9: I suppose that both rooms bidding can qualify as surprising... possibly strange :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni is  1 in the world, that also applies to (lack of) pace :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: he might opt for a @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=103  Fulvio Fantoni|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless Nathalie fell asleep|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's past midnight in Monaco|pg||
nt|penseur9: right and I beleive one more round to play afterwards|pg||

nt|tez: i said for number 3|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: and they are surely right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol  it took him 8½ minutes to find the only lead that gives the contract|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: naither 5 minutes now Roland? :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: another*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although there is still scope for declarer to go wrong of course|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: you both are LOL|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  we have four more boards to investigate the system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: who would lead a trump from Qx?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tez: agree Paul:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this hand I would be wary of overcalling 1@s with no length in clubs and not great values|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: 200|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: diamond switch tricks 2 could have been more   but thats asking too much|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Fit jump?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: Elle avait caché un As !!!|pg||
nt|hantveit: they lead a club at the other table, but Stabile must have picked wrong card in trick 11 and 1 imp out|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Fit showing jump?|pg||
nt|penseur9: can he mange the @Hs Roland?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|paulg:  3@d now, good raise?|pg||

nt|hedyg: i have support for any suit my pd bids|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes that too LOL|pg||
nt|athene: double 2@C is an alternative for north|pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: 1@S = 0-11 without 4 cards @S|pg||
nt|ady: 6th diamond becomes good after 3 ruffs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, he doesn't even need a club trick|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he thinks that should promise four spades for sure|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup: that is interesting now|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|hantveit: interesting contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is (super) gazzilli for F-N?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 4@C bid may have staved off 3nt by s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  agree. 2@d would have been better for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but will W pass?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, he did|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|santyclz: Other Table, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 14-17 with @c or 17+ any|pg||
nt|hedyg: but also unbalanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay, 2@H= @H+@c|pg||
nt|paulg:  fantoni-nunes play more 8- and 9-card major fits in 3NT than any other expert pairs I've seen|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: the pass asked for the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: Twisted Swine type runouts after NT doubled maybe|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2 times trumph, but what if south covers the second trumph?|pg||
nt|paulg:  less advisable here of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: so Fantoni has shown minimum for his 1@H opening 5@H 4@s and refused the invite by Nunes|pg||
nt|penseur9: this one will play better... time for coffee|pg||
nt|ady: trying a@H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The one thing he better not do is draw two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nunes will "know" @HA is not cashing ... no Blackwood|pg||
nt|ady: why lead an ace then   could have been club void?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: 5@H and 4@c of course! sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: as we can see, no way to game now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, he had to lead something.  And neither of the singletons is at all attractive|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  looks like one down with this lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but defence has to cash its tricks now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it looks fairly easy for the defence to let 4@s make|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Rubens Hand Evaluator rates the n hand as 12.60 points:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=a108+1062+kqj754+4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @c return, declarer will have his work easier|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck: NT Runouts: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/SwineTwisted.html|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@c could have been @c & @d here if they play that style|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hantveit: maybe just play dia now, and give away that ruff|pg||
nt|mathat: if duk the @d meda 4|pg||
nt|athene: this won't play well; if the defence can get a force on west, he can say goodbye to his club suit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: 3NT looks a lot better than 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: 7-2 hands rarely play well in the short suit unless partner has five-card support|pg||
nt|athene: 7-4 hands|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|santyclz: It's an  old fashioned 2@d bid, but not in the last 4-5 decades.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tez: 4th  seat 2@h..intermediate i think|pg||
nt|kjadams: This double looks like zimmermann felt the vulnerable game bid created a forcing pass.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: it is not an obligation to play in a suit contract just because you have a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he might have drawn the conclusion that the @CA was more likely to cash, otherwise, East might have fished around for a grand slam or maybe used Exclusion Blackwood|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: because if you are 7-4, you are short in the other two suits and you get forced|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  seems better for defence now|pg||
nt|runnerup: west was active this time -ew has only 19 points and he was willing to double ns on 2-levelcan be costly |pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: @HK good shift, now it's easy to follow it up with the small heart|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gluckenval: all in trsf for them, 1@C -> 1@D/@H = 4@H/@S, so 1@S = no 4M|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2 club losers and 2H|pg||

nt|athene: oh dear!|pg||
nt|athene: did he really do that?|pg||
nt|athene: this whole hand is a battle between west's trump length and north's|pg||
nt|athene: giving him that one extra trump gives him the club suit back|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: I suppose it is quite normal for NS to get to this game , with or w/o interferance|pg||
nt|psyck: It has its chances, especially with W marked with high cards & potentially endplayed|pg||
nt|psyck: Dec larer is planning to strip W of muinors 1st|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|psyck: (i try to respond to all private messages...but i may be swamped occasionally...)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: when you are defending against this sort of contract, where declarer is in a 4-4 fit with a really long side-suit, all you care about is making sure he can't ever draw trumps and ...|pg||
nt|athene: keep control to cash the suit|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you do that it turns out he can change plans and crossruff but that is too bad, killing the side-suit is the first priority|pg||

nt|hantveit: or let the dia run to the ace and play another dia... |pg||
nt|paulg:  looks like NS should stop in 3@s here, but often someone bids one more|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|penseur9: 1@C or 1@D from E?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Small plusses in both rooms add up to 4 imps for Zimmerman.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: good 4@S here|pg||
nt|kjadams: others think that if NV opponents ever bid over your vul game that you have to double, but here you see the result.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i guess the 2@d opener is multi 2@d, showing a weak two in either major|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d was multi showing a weak hand with a long major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = 10-13 with diamonds|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psyck: Maybe Operator should change E's name to Zia :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: board 4 was more difficolut for Multon in other Room.... the overbid was 1@D (not dbl) and the final dbl was from South....|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry Paul :(|pg||

nt|kjadams: Hi Joe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gluckenval: 1D = 4+/4+ same rank|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after strong club opening, NS may use their methods to pre-empt|pg||
nt|runnerup: well you cant do this in every board -otherwise youll have heart attact very soon-down 1 by uppercup|pg||
nt|paulg:  i did presume that West might show some support!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  at least they have ones|pg||
nt|hantveit: anyway, a big lead now for Zimmermann after only 5 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  at least we agree!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz2:  I wonder what the x was, majors?|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 imps per hand in average|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|athene: north might opt for notrumps over spades with that hand, even with the 5-3 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  looks like, but what about points?|pg||
nt|paulg:  double by West is pass or correct|pg||
nt|penseur9: 1@C strong but west whit 4 points could lead to problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: some east migth open here -althougth east has a 3-suiter not suitable fos muidenberg |pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 3nt now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think I might have tried to bid my clubs|pg||
nt|tez: what do you bid with West hand?pass?2@h 3@h?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: hmm, operator updated 4@s to -1|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe Zia did not cover 3rd @d or something|pg||
nt|hedyg: double was: pass if your suit is @H , else bid your suit|pg||
pc|dT|nt|runnerup: they really likes to bid|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Again e has done a lot of bidding on 2 hcp.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  makeable with @c lead and guessing @h right|pg||
nt|penseur9: their are no on line results available on line unfortunatly|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Extremely weak nt non-vul.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|runnerup: perhaps Nunes had his moment for 2 @d -now more difficult |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  natural one down now|pg||
nt|kjadams: aggressive 2N will pay off here.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Optomistic bid by n.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: this seems to be a couple down after @d finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would pass if i had no other bidding cards|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Tez, welcome|pg||
nt|athene: well, either game makes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz2:  E-w gained 3 imps on bd four to shoot into the lead!|pg||
nt|runnerup: but like you see -no mistakes -very good lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  i thought it would go 1@h (1@s) 3@h (3@s) all pass|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: with likely 3 minor suit losers  needs spade finesse   and luck with hearts|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  will West underlead his clubs to get a spade ruff?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes!|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, that 6@C was too much for my pc :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: This is turning into a rout.|pg||
nt|kjadams: In theory, that finesse not safe, but declarer's assumption that they can't cash 3 spades here is right.|pg||
nt|kjadams: If east started with A63 of spades, this would now go down.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fantoni will be considering three hearts to pitch his club|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  so he paused|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Well, he needs the @Sqj doubleton, he knows the @D distribution, what does that say about the rounded suits?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|santyclz: I'm in favor  of their moving right along.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S not bid in CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Virtually cold grand slam now|pg||
nt|ady: with the spade diamond 2 suiter|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, sry, @s shift wasn't required.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Easy 4@H game here|pg||
nt|ybob: EW can win 12 trick in @D |pg||
nt|hedyg: playing 3 rounds of @c on lead sure helped|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sfoxa:  wondering about the reason|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would not open 2s in south. Too strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Let's follow their methods. Bill will explain|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: it can often be difficult for operator to get all the cards right, when they play fast or cards not seen clearly, play may have been slightly different in the 4@s -1 than shown|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW might get active and will regret finding their otherwise good @S save.|pg||
nt|hantveit: partner dos not need much before 4s is on|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a @s after taking the @c was the right move, however east deserves a prize for his imaginative defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: seems EW play that 3M shows 5 card in the other majors to have the strong hand playing the suit contract in case there is fit|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 3@S shows 5@H GF ( not alert )|pg||
nt|tomi2: north could not bid 2@C, this would have shown both majors in their methods|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3NT here, nothing much to it really- Danger is getting to high in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  west forced to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@S = natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C = natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks pal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Happy to be of service|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure how we would cope without you|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulg:  is that a weak two or a constructive two bid? Looks far too good for a weak 2@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is a vulnerable 2nd seat weak 2|pg||
nt|athene: this double might warn them off the doomed 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: not so much reason to double here|pg||
nt|athene: first of all, you are on lead against notrumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: 2@S is a fit - jump, I think, however, West generally will have a 4th @D for this.|pg||
nt|stoffers: That 3@d bid might lead them offtrack|pg||
nt|stoffers: and it did..|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When we explain our version of Fantunes to our opps, we generally say: "our system is more natural than yours"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: few play FJ with 3 card supp, or may have stretched to hinder strong @c bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 1@C could be 2 cards on many weak nt hands or 0+ but then he must have 18+, thats unlikely|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs 5@d Fantoni needs to lead K@c tough|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3S or pass in my opinion|pg||
nt|santyclz: Seems like a book vulnerable weak 2 to me.  The 6/4 adds to the value but still...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But now the difficult part, cuebids, Turbo, whatever|pg||
nt|ady: so far seems very natural|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wstuart: I'm pretty insistent in my partnerships of having at least 4 of thee anchor suit (partner's suit) for a fit jump.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4H here has 2 spades and a club to lose.   Needs kx of hearts onside.|pg||
nt|athene: secondly, most people play smolen and suchlike so even if NS end in a major, you will be on lead|pg||
nt|athene: the only time it's right to get your partner to lead a diamond is when the opponents are going to end up in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: of course the problem here is that the double got them into clubs when they would have played 3nt :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sfoxa:  1@s = 0-11, no 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Rubens hand evaluator agrees with you.  12.55 http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=ak10972+42+7+10652|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c probably a min balanced hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s seems to be forcing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wstuart: It make s avery bid difference in these competitive auctions to know what the caliber of your fit(s) are.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Vs slam you dont lead the king, because partner is to overtake it...Have to lead small from Kx|pg||
nt|stoffers: Thats a free tip actually :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  may well be repeated next door|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  âOther Tableâ, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As you predicted...|pg||
nt|mathat: dbl promises @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: punishing his pd for overcalling?|pg||
nt|paulg:  east seems to have the same understanding of double to me|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5C gives up any chance of a plus score.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H is -1 and so is 5@C for NS, their best spot.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is not the bestlooking for west -but good guess @d saves the day -and luck +guess in @c also|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is possible that East would have bid 4@h over a simple raise, but this has no real play on this layout|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: i can hear Tamburelli swearing into his beard all the way here!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tomi2: I dont think north would overcall with j6th only red so Bakkeren should get this one right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  lack of @c cue is obvious now|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Fulvio could find it.... |pg||
nt|stoffers: They found out the @c problem in the quebidseries, but so did Fantoni i guess|pg||
nt|stoffers: The questionable bid here is 3@d, i suggest 2nt with all those soft cards. Queens and Jacks plays good in NT |pg||

nt|ritong: last time fantoni did that, he got ruffed on the lead  perhaps he will make a remark about that displaying the dummy|pg||

nt|bjacobs: South cued 4@S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|penseur9: 3@D should make but possibly 3@H by E/W might have also|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hello Henri|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi |pg||
nt|ritong: sorry for the initial caps|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3S force|pg||
nt|kjadams: battle for overtricks here.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i like South's 3@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S = no major|pg||
nt|penseur9: we must thank our excellent commentators, Roland, Bill, david and henri also...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psyck: as of now at least|pg||
nt|pfbr: hi Henri :)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c dbl was not for penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: corrected to down 3 ok|pg||
nt|tez: ty all:) Ty Hedy:)|pg||
nt|kjadams: can only presume they play 10-12 or so NT.  Do not have their system notes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: duck a @C and hope 2@D cash - high xruff after that|pg||
nt|wstuart: If the def leads trumps to prevent that, life could get interesting.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, trump leads best|pg||
nt|stoffers: But, partner had 5-4 and not 5332 so no problem this time|pg||
nt|hedyg: X over 1NT= same strength|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very light NT-non vul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  your appearance should be marked :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: a safe contract as the card lie|pg||
nt|hantveit: gave a trick at the lead so 11 now it seems|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wow, they really overplayed it in the closed room!|pg||
nt|tez: neck n neck now:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: double by N showed strength|pg||
nt|hedyg: btw you all like 2@c by W???|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  i would say it is an aggressive double of 1NT ... we tend to want a point or two more in the UK|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the last board of this session.  Does anyone know when the next starts?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hantveit: 13 tricks in 4S at the other table. Spade J lead?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would have passed the redouble ... it does not show a desire to play in 1@H-XX for me|pg||
nt|penseur9: very hard to predict final score yet|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks Roland you beat me to it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because I am 6 hrs ahead of you|pg||
nt|penseur9: I beleive they will restart tomorrow at 2pm local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill's comments even faster as he is a further 9 hours ahead|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|athene: that lesser-known bidding art: "splinter rebids by a 1nt opener" |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW will gain an imp here - important for them|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard to believe the @s6 becomes a 2nd stopper.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 8 top tricks here.  Needs to establish one more, which can be done in clubs with a good guess.|pg||
nt|santyclz: A small @c to  the 9 looks good here.|pg||
nt|kjadams: he must guess that spades are not running.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a pretty good hand for hearts what with the ruffing value|pg||
nt|ritong: bonjour madame|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stoffers: nice splits here, and 110 or 140 incoming|pg||
nt|ritong: i try to procced more discreetly usually:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A couple of alert specs tell me that 6@C can make on a spade lead also. Complete cross-ruff and score last trump en passant. Well spotted|pg||
nt|ritong: quel plaisir de vous voir:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: we play penalty dbl after rdbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt make the 2@c bid look any hotter to me|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: What's the Saturday weather like, Bill? And the lottery numbers please|pg||
nt|santyclz: N couldn't afford to duck the @s for fear of a @h switch.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  looks like it is going one down, which it a little close for comfort|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes and -1 makes sometimes...|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Paul|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry guys, get some uniformed information "no" but I asked for someone who knows the EW agreements and not his own ones ;)|pg||
nt|stoffers: that 7 of spades is gonna win defence a trick soon..|pg||
nt|santyclz: Played by w, @c lead.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|wstuart: Here are a couple of sites that people refered for the tourney:|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass= you pick a suit pd, i can take any|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told the next session starts in 5-10 minutes.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|stoffers: No, sry :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes|pg||
nt|hantveit: Stabile played spade K when east played low spade from table? very strange|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's pleasant day, about 20C|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wstuart: http://www.visitmonaco.com/us/News/News/Monaco-Welcomes-the-International-Bridge-Elite|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps a penalty card?|pg||
nt|hantveit: a little break here now, so closed can speed ut ahead|pg||
nt|santyclz: The closed room seems to have disappeared.|pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe, but then it must have been dropped at the table...|pg||
nt|kjadams: the ace play blocks suit.   |pg||
nt|kjadams: ducking allows unblock.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|santyclz2:  Friendly hand. Declarer could easily lose control if things weren't breaking so well.|pg||
nt|psyck: that was the last deal of this match|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 more matches in this session|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: cashing side winners now to prepare xruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: all it takes is a tiny glitch|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wstuart: http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/fbm-prince-albert-ii-cup-inaugural-edition.html|pg||
nt|penseur9: thank you to all our fine spectators for their comments and questions... hope to se you all tomorrow|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The stock market is going down|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulg:  this time last year I was playing with a Scotsman who has lived in France for the last 30 years ... it became clear to me that we lived in different universes when it came to bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What else would you like to know?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: 9 @C and duck equally good.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: this pair plays 3NT as a solid MAJOR opening. many players play as solid minor some as solid "any suit"|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: lottery numbers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 12, 16, 23, 27, 36 and 40|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
nt|penseur9: I can give you the loosing numbers Roland :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: well done|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stoffers: Multon didnt rebid 3@d in Open room on previous, and won 13 on that decission|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d6|nt|psyck: playing @d's towards AK is good technique in case N is short|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||

pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: Thanks all entertaining match.|pg||
nt|mathat: if J @c is !E ?|pg||
nt|mathat: never x to the 9|pg||
nt|kjadams: Light opener in other room stole the board!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Then they are 3-2 and anything works or e has made a strange play from kj10x and nothing works.|pg||
nt|mathat: safety play x @d to the N and x @c from dummy|pg||
nt|mathat: nows S were is the 7 @s|pg||
nt|mathat: N|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: operator loves to joke LOL|pg||
nt|penseur9: as some predicted, we have a tye|pg||
nt|tez: she should take last trump i thk..for sqz..it was not real sqz but..|pg||
