mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psridhar: basically they had an unfortunate opener Vs Bulgaria, losing 5-25 , but the other two matches were drawn |pg||
nt|yuval10: good morning all|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  hi Yuval|pg||
nt|psridhar: tough deal to start with here -NS may try a slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: 11 tops in 6N with either a 5th @H trick OR @c hook or squeeze|pg||
nt|andyv:  12 tricks are there....4@h, 3@c, 3@d and 2@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: tough call, N promised 19 already, and he has some extra point and A@h |pg||
nt|andyv:  if in 6N, declarer will be forced to take the @c hook once the @h suit doesn't come in|pg||
nt|yuval10: he lacks spots though|pg||
nt|psridhar: NT has been rt-sided -else he @c lead can remove 2 working options in one go|pg||
nt|andyv:  already right sided (NT that is)|pg||
nt|psridhar: W can win  @d and test him with a @c shift if @H have not been tested till then|pg||
nt|andyv:  defense can make this very difficult by leading a @s and removing an entry from either hand early|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can hold up twice on @ds to prevent easy access to dummy|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: there you go|pg||
nt|andyv:  so , Q@s will be lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  oh well, this makes it easy|pg||
nt|psridhar: West can wiin @d early and push a @c removing both winning options-but the @c lead alas..|pg||
nt|yuval10: that'd make the play quicker|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  lead doesn't make sense when you are holding such a @s holding|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|kit: 3NT call is risky, but passing is just as risky|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: it's west thinking. Not South of course|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: would west dble with only 2 jacks?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although it really doesn't matter much what he plays as he's due to get 2@d tricks without the ruff.|pg||
nt|kit: right, but he doesn't know that|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well what is W doubling on?|pg||
nt|kit: who knows -- but when I see a sure set I take it|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: fleisher still thinking|pg||
nt|jcwla: And if W is out of @S?|pg||
nt|kit: there is no way West would be leading queen of diamonds from Qxx on this auction -- it must be a short suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|xenya: top 12 tricks with  4-3 @Hs with a club finesse in reserve, also some squeeze chances|pg||

nt|xenya: i'm afraif i can't explain this auction|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Martel bought the contract at 3@S in the open room so USA 1 takes the early lead.|pg||

nt|xenya: he will after 5@H by N|pg||
nt|szalay: I feel it nearly automatic|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|kit: However, the 4@S call is effective, pushing the opponents overboard when 4@S was headed down.  Same auction at both tables.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The double with three only @H's does not seem to have a lot of upside and we see the danger here.  Would prefer to have a stiff for this 4@S.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: Might not llike having only 3 hearts, but I don't think North can sit back and pass -- too easy to lose a double part-score swing when partner has a minor.|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  small heart or @d10?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: With South's 5@C call under pressure, North has to guess whether or not to bid the slam|pg||
