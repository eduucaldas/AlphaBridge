pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: if you are bidding confidently enough, you have a good chance to push non-vulnerable opponents a bit higher |pg||
nt|yuval10: it's likely that @c's are 2-2 because both defenders were in their hand once and didn't play @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps the only possible case in which it won't apply is when South has A@c singelton, and that's what makes W thinks|pg||
nt|yuval10: if South has the A@c, and he wins and play @d, then declarer has to guess, which of course is not optimal|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|drorp: i bet this table will be the 1st one in the room finishing the set, they've played 12 boards in just about an hour so far|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think basically you should have a @h-stopper for the 1nt-bid anyway - the dbl mainly shows length and it is a suggestion only - S wasnt fooled to pass :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3major openings normally asks for aces in Ps hand - S has everything|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: 2BA = forsing z fitem|pg||

nt|lechcold: u nas rzadko grywane, w USA w³aciwie standard|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but 3@h really is mysterious|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: if the play record is correct, S won 4@s in the other room - 2 down may be a wrong entry |pg||
pc|h7|nt|grebrof: with the @hs 3-3 this would be an undebid with this lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: he has 6@s, he has a @d super stopper, but he elects a third possibility with @h xx  strange|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|drorp: running the diamond with 10 top tricks could've been seen a bit embarassing if it went K@D, @D ruff, @C to A and @D ruff|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|grebrof: well |pg||
pc|c5|nt|drorp: but the chances of that were very slim, and not all saftey plays are worth while, losing 1 imp every time is costly also|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 2 to go|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h4|nt|ritong: zack is trying to reconstitute the hidden hands  he has no chance to get that right imo|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer is supposed to hold 7 @hs, for starters|pg||
nt|xenya: settling for 2 off is not a problem here -- just ruff a club, losing a club and a trump -- but if he tries for something better he mat regret it|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard contributed @h Q on the lead, so no trump trick for his side|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: so last board, grateful thanks to our great operator Pim, Jon for his comments and a big thanks spectators for your great feedback|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: with what looks like a good result for Israel, when 4@h is cold|pg||
nt|ritong: that would tie the match  not sure 2 imps is worth 1 VP|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder how 4@H went down in the OR|pg||
nt|ritong: relatively naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: north led a @c, ducked|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't have an indication from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: then grue draw @h A in order to avoid a possible guess later|pg||
nt|ritong: then the roof fell on him|pg||
nt|yuval10: here it looks like South would bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Americans have been a disappointment to me in this match - but quite a long way to go before the KO stages|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you can probably guess I'm wearing a broad smile at this stage Jon|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: pachtman had very good hand for hearts, but didn't realise the 7-5 distribution, looked more like 6-5 or 7-4|pg||
nt|mamos: and a few small swings mostly to Israel|pg||
nt|grebrof: thats true Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: tu nasi s¹ w 3BA, wist kierowy - musz¹ wygraæ|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow. did he ever|pg||
nt|drorp: Gino's tactic didn't work out, personally i would just blast a big diamond bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ritong: no need to precise that south did not enter the bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: not many big mistakes have been made in this match - no wonder they have started well these teams|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: chagas may have found the bid that will get them to slam|pg||
nt|drorp: needs to find another bid now|pg||
nt|drorp: very tough slam to bid, based on the 10 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hardly Chagas "duty" to bid slam, but I guess S has one more bid if Chagas can dig up some @d-support|pg||
nt|mamos: Will EW pass if he bids 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: woow..the french team are looking for english blood at the 1 level|pg||
