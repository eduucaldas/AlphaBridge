mb|2C!|nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  a close question whether to double or bid 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  On the surface 4@s is a very reasonable contract -- down because of the bad red suit breaks.|pg||
nt|3for3: north south play canape with a big club...|pg||

mb|1N|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: 5@S C NS depending @SK first|pg||
nt|henryb:  South's vulnerable overcall is unlikely to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4@S looks good here but down on bad breaks @S 4-1 k@C offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: this is a feisty auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n or 5@d look really cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Schwartz-Finkel play 2/1 with many special agreements in various auctions|pg||
nt|henryb:  Vivaldi-Mosca also play fairly straightforward methods but unusual 2-bids|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  3!n is better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: a safe 6@H save for ew with 6@HX-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I expect Schwartz will bid 4@s and probably play there|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south being cautious|pg||
nt|roswolf: rightly so|pg||
nt|3for3: east should be able to handle this...since south's trumps are so low|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jaapfr: 11 tricks now after @H lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be quick i hope|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the crux here is how can EW enter the bidding with their @C@H fits (almost impoossible)|pg||

pc|h9|nt|henryb:  Of course if the N-S cards were switched, 3!n would not look as good|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  down 1, which is actually a good save against a making 4@h for N-S|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hlortz: was mosca's pass over 4@S forcing?  maybe|pg||
nt|3for3: levin doesnt want arnim in to play 2 more rounds of trump|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S failed in open room...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: this is where players err -south knows no defence works therefore play quickly and conservr mental energy - there is a lot of bridge left to be played|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|3for3: it looks like declarer can prvail, trump a heart in hand...even though the 3d club gets ruffed, and overruffed, the long diamond can be the10th trick... I think!|pg||

nt|henryb:  hello|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jaapfr: most likely 4@S-1 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: almost impossible to reach DD par 6@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  Strong NT  - Stayman - 2@h or possibly transfer and 2@s as final contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: i expect 3@S/P/P/3NT to be very common on this hand|pg||
nt|3for3: east could double but..|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: hmmmmmm another 4@s this time for n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand. so many options.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|henryb:  North may raise 2@h to 3|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W make 6@h unless N-S negotiate a @c ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H makeable and 6@S by NS a good save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: best to pass as E but tough|pg||
nt|jaapfr: best=best result|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well if 4@C IS A CUE IN THEIR SYSTEM I WOULD BID IT|pg||
nt|roswolf: but many play it as a big 2 suiter even in this type of sequence|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S, I think, might make 4@s or 5@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They make 5@S, max.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now 3nt in right hand whilst @C lead very unlikely|pg||
nt|3for3: that will still lead to 3nt|pg||
nt|3for3: I'd lead a club here...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: also if 2@S would be a wjs - a slam try is indicated|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H clearly slamming|pg||
nt|roswolf: noryth signs off with his load of trash|pg||
nt|roswolf: SHOULD sign off|pg||
nt|henryb:  or four in a "death wish|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3? that's for wimps lol a bold 4!|pg||
nt|3for3: but a spade could have easily been right|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: 3nt now imo|pg||
nt|hlortz: well all that wasted @D stuff a bit unlucky but pressing for game not vul seems 'optimistic'|pg||
nt|henryb:  wimpishness has a lot so say for itself: if you had to choose between 2@h and 4@h, 2@h would be most people's choice on the N-S cards :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|jaapfr: 3nt is down with @C lead whilst no entry in E|pg||

pc|d3|nt|jaapfr: good 4@S but a pity down 1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ods 99-1 it is down 1 here:)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  I think 5@s does not make if E-W tap dummy before both their spade winners are gone|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: the scores are not updated yet http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|roswolf: thinnish 3nt bid and made in the other room|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: now all the more diff ...even impossible|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is incredible - what is he thinking about - the number of angels you can get on a pinhead!?|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile you sell several 6-7 imp losses to gain one 10 imp or 6 imp gain. not a good tradeoff, imo|pg||
nt|henryb:  close whether to respond 1@h or pass. I would pass. but if he bids 1@h, as he did, partner will raise to 4.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: an ace and J, I would respond.|pg||
nt|henryb:  not an easy hand to play. but cards lie favorably|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: he wants to see the defence against multi|pg||

nt|3for3: we know meyers couldnt open 2@D, since that was multi.  i'd think most would open 1@D if 2 not available|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: its just awfully good,  but not perfect   |pg||
nt|3for3: on the board, with a vul game swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: Della in the other room did open it 1 @D |pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: south so far told he had 10 cards in 2 suits and no void.|pg||

nt|3for3: not bad at all|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|henryb:  Here is one of those pushy games that put pressure on the opponents|pg||

nt|sybarra: rehi Danny |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt is not a cool alternative|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: "the Viking club" played by Grøtheim and Tundal is probably the most famous system from Norway, but still few players in Norway actually play it|pg||

mb|p|nt|projekt1: precision 1@d|pg||

nt|3for3: most play that double of 2@C here is a good hand...says nothing about clubs.|pg||
nt|3for3: Like she had penalty doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: you need real methods with this range of nt,  and defending it |pg||
mb|d|nt|grebrof: S does have a huge hand + its not pretty bidding a suit topped by the JT|pg||
nt|alpagavp: quasi impossible to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 6@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  a good slam well reached by the germans in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: make 7, has to ruff 2 D on the table as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i think Levin wrote as if i had doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: but this is the Venice Cup,  so all systems "on"  |pg||
mb|p!|nt|mikael_w: yes, almost posible to beat 3 NT if dec makes alot of missguess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|grebrof: so it should be possible to copy this|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any slam played by N will be cold (not 6@h/@c) :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: and if we play 6@d for south hand the only lead that beats the contract is @c no?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 1N as West, but it is very unclear|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Double would be reasonable|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: which doesnt have much play even on a non spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT (Jacoby) or 4@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not sure what version of Jacoby the Americans play|pg||
nt|henryb:  Much too good for 4@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C short and 3@D short.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: W not into bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the best is to play 6NT from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H shows a smattering of hcp i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no 2@H is preference for weak with both majors|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|nkgupt: i have seen many experts rebid 2@d on such hands and find it diff to catch up later|pg||

nt|nkgupt: well is wat i said ....a good 3@d bid|pg||

nt|grebrof: 2@s shows the @c suit I am told - thank you|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think she was going to pass anything Arnim bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: she has a 5 count opposite 10-12,  so she knows opps have more points|pg||
nt|sybarra: she was in mucking it up |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes, i guess she would, doesnt seem to be other option, would have played in a 3 3 fit :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep  my guess also |pg||
nt|sybarra: from her hand opps likely to have game anywhere |pg||

nt|rnmalik: should be an easy make.|pg||
nt|3for3: well, 10-12 at unfavorable is pretty loony, imo.  No offense to those who do so|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: he could have ducked the @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes with certain dbles you could go for 800 or so |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: almost none playing 12-14 vul, 10-12 would be too much|pg||

nt|hlortz: and its 3:35am here in seattle so i'm off to bed. enjoyable comments and some action hads|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D multi overcall?|pg||
nt|sybarra: something special |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty! lets see if we get to 100 imps on this set|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bobh1: on 13, where NS had a shapely 11 opposite 8, they did bid 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h is 5+@h, 5+ second suit, less than opening strength|pg||
nt|hlortz: hands that n key is nnnnnnnnnnnnnnot going to behave :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bobh1: and lost 5 imps|pg||
mb|d|an|5-7|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: see you all tomorrow for the next matches, starting at 10.30 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may use the "multi overcall" vs a big club system |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am guessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they are yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult auction for n/s to get into, but then do they really want to be "in" |pg||

nt|alpagavp: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: this looks like a good save for NS|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like down 1, no tragedy when 4@d makes E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: power bidding|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|grebrof: 4 @s must be better than this|pg||
nt|3for3: meyers cant be sad defending with 6 trump is always fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: if Sabine passes,   might have been -2 and tied match?|pg||
nt|3for3: i think it would have been better than that for ew.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hlortz: even better 3n makes ew also lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D can make except for super defence, @CA and small @S.:)|pg||
nt|projekt1: again a possibility for phantastic defence : @cA -10, low @s -  @c ruff|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|bobh1: S's hand is borderline for 2N...it's a little too good, if anything|pg||
