mb|p|mb|2D|nt|roswolf: this is a feisty auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n or 5@d look really cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Schwartz-Finkel play 2/1 with many special agreements in various auctions|pg||
nt|henryb:  Vivaldi-Mosca also play fairly straightforward methods but unusual 2-bids|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henryb:  3!n is better|pg||

pc|sK|nt|hlortz: was mosca's pass over 4@S forcing?  maybe|pg||
