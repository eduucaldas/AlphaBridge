mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: my guess about 2@D response came from Nystrom-Bertheau Supplementary Notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assumed same relay structure even though they use different opening 2-bids|pg||
nt|cicus: upmark-cullin system notes (page 4) confirm your explanation, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 7   Nystrom-Bertheau got shut out of @S, sold to 2@C South  and Pakistan on the board with 11 imps|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3H|nt|farrukh: so it seems that there may be some ruling involved looking at the bidding and the table score for board 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i thought other room played 6@H  but movie showing 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which way do you think score will be adjusted??|pg||
mb|4D|nt|farrukh: i am told that they played 6@h is right.|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: 2@C CHECKBACK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s = 3 card spades|pg||
nt|farrukh: but now either it is operator error or Director's ruling, so we'll get the update shortly|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   6@H moved back to 4@H was the adjustment|pg||
nt|farrukh: in fact most likely its a director's ruling because the score showed a pushed board and then it changed later|pg||
