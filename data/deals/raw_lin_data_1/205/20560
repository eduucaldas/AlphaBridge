mb|p|nt|jdonn: 1@c is 16+ artificial, 1@H is 8-11, any shape|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe its open room bidding|pg||

nt|jdonn: hello|pg||
nt|vbman: auction dosnt fit says a kib|pg||
nt|jdonn: the vugraph operator assures the players and auction are correct, but something doesn't make sense. This pair plays precision, but this is a natural auction (other than 1@d showing ...|pg||

nt|vbman: maybe country is true players names are wrong|pg||
nt|nickf: no, these are the players from the Closed room.|pg||
nt|vbman: 2nt minimum or constructive?|pg||
nt|jdonn: 2nt I think they would almost always bid, to leave opener room to continue showing shape|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jdonn: this is not an easy slam to reach, with 31 and no fit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jdonn: but it's a great slam|pg||
nt|vbman: someone may overtry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vbman: 4nt quant here?|pg||
nt|jdonn: North will probably pass, he has 20 opposite 8-11 with no fit|pg||
nt|vbman: by lall?|pg||
nt|vbman: if part continues to show shape l wonder if it shows xtras too or only obligation??|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vbman: opertor,,,|pg||
nt|jdonn: south's jack of hearts and ten of diamonds are what make slam so nice but it's pretty much impossible to find out about the cards in that detail|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  East will be tempted to pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North may respond 4@S  to his partner's one-bid. No, he has preferred 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we are up to speed now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to claim the first 2 |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is two down, assuming the defence attack clubs early enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  And now West has a problem. 2@s is non forcing, but he has a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: but nanev, with singleton spade facing a takeout double, might bid on|pg||
pc|h4|mc|12|nt|rhelle:  He doesn't know about the wasted @h values in his partner's hand, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of auction some play 2NT by the opener as weak-strong. That allows them to show a strong 3@C rebid (by bidding 3@C) or a shapely weaker one (via 2NT).|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  well done then anyway :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  NL is taking a bid lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I totally agree with this call.  South knows his side has at least 8 clubs and E-W have at least 8 hearts, so odds in favor of competing to 3@C|pg||

nt|vbman: this one is getting to be a street fight|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vbman: will bid|pg||
nt|jdonn: he certainly might bid, east didn't double 5@s|pg||
nt|vbman: the double of 4sp must mean 'l want to bid more'|pg||
mb|6C|nt|jdonn: and even if 6@H were going down, n/s might mistakenly sacrifice in 6@s anyway|pg||
mb|6S|nt|vbman: great guess josh|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn: n/s don't know if slam was making or down, but 6@s is so cheap at this vulnerability that north wouldn't want to take a chance|pg||

mb|d|nt|boedhy:  offcourse South Africa not among the favorites|pg||
nt|rhelle:  true - but a very solid team|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  although Apteker Gower are a good international pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  And teh Netherlands are among the topfavorites especially on home turf|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@c will be lead directing|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is very high up on Roland Wald's list of the world's 10 worst conventions too.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Roland agrees.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It has always staggered me that so many very good players use it.|pg||
nt|kit: big advantage of Flannery is that you don't have to respond 1@S to 1@H on a 4-bagger, so opener knows it shows 5.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  well ... I think Italy is very strong, especially in the absence of the alltime strong USA teams|pg||
nt|brolucius: Roland thinks the convention is so totally awful that he forbids commentators to use the F-word. (I will let your one aberration go unreported on this ocasion, Kit.)|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  think this last one will loose|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kit: Weinstein evaluates his hand too strong for 1NT opening due to good 5-card club suit and 2 aces.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H call shows 5 spades, 4 hearts, invite values if I remember|pg||
nt|brolucius: The US South did enter on the @CK-Q-J-x-x-x hand and they then pushed E/W to 5@S for a 13-IMP swing.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|boedhy:  against 5@s doubled|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|boedhy:  with all the good tens and the @h king onsite he will make 9 tricks...|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to our excellent VG operator for the bidding explanations. Roland told us that the operators have been practising for a while and they have certainly been very good.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Good point. Some play that an immediate double shows values, some that it denies them.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: now it is looking more likely he is short in spades - with 2-4-2-5 he might open 1nt?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|santyclz: Anyone for a 3@h bid  by s on the 2nd round?|pg||
nt|kit: How can North possibly take another call?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W stopped in 2@H making, for China, on the board where we saw South make a pre-emptive raise to 3@C. 5 IMPs.|pg||
nt|athene: of course if he has a singleton spade you are down too :) but if he has doubleton, what are the odds it is Qx?|pg||
nt|kareno: He is the opening bidder which changes things somewhat.|pg||
nt|kareno: And no @h k|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure, it was close call|pg||
nt|athene: the @H10 here makes 6@H better|pg||
nt|athene: i mean better than it might have been :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|kit: South could have a doubleton spade and a 6-count it would seem.  Unless these bids don't mean what they look like.|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@h is practically laydown while 6@s relies on 3-2 spades pretty well.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|boedhy:  And apteker will get the @c right|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|athene: if south knows his partner's shape then 6@H looks clear, with the good suit texture, even not knowing of the @H10 opposite|pg||
nt|kareno: Still it is hard to posit such a perfect fit.|pg||
nt|athene: a pity - my guess is south found out distribution but didn't know he was facing so many prime cards|pg||
nt|kareno: I would guess Italy will find the slam in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: and he didn't have any way to make a mild slam try in hearts - if he had done so, north would surely have accepted|pg||

nt|boedhy:  But Muller wil be thinking about this...|pg||

nt|boedhy:  only one in 7@d on the board... Chili against Italy bog lead for them also|pg||
nt|yke:  some players might just open 1NT. But maybe they play 13-15 NT since they play precision?|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North has a monster hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: some would overcall 1nt here, but pass looks fine with that shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and indeed Prooyen Verhees also bid it and even made a uptrick|pg||
nt|brolucius: The KR evaluator program seems to take a bizarre valuation of jacks. Roland quoted an example where Q-J doubleton was allocated only 0.75 points, compared with x-x. Seems much too ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little for me.|pg||
nt|athene: wait till they bid hearts, then double for takeout :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: Their system got the bidding too elevated before south could describe his hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@d = 0-8|pg||
nt|athene: that's the classic recipe for that south hand|pg||
mb|2S!|an|forcing|mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Apteker was very happy to be in it and played very save..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@h = 19+|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = 6-8, balanced|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can they get 6@s in south....|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so any 4333 or 4432|pg||
nt|boedhy:  which is very good|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rhelle:  2@h = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@c = 4333 with a 4-card minor|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but the system will let it play in North probably and |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now versace runs to hearts and north doubles |pg||
nt|athene: but south won't (shouldn't) stick this, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: cue 2@H, check for 44 spades, bid 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: even though it's nice to go for penalties at this vulnerability, you know opps surely have an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: so defending at the 1-level might well be wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think not.  His pass of 1@d doubled was likely influenced by the vulnerability.  As it is north was on the thin side of the double and might have eschewed the double of 1@h ...|pg||
nt|kareno: with such thin hearts.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: On this hand, East may have upgraded his hand to 18 points, with two tens that accompany other honours, and two 4-card suits.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  3@d = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s = 3-3-4-3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  as South promises at least 1 control (a king), the North hand is now looking pretty good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then 6@s is is a little better then 50% because you can guess the @d and on a @d or non @d lead you get info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had he opened 1NT, which I assume shows 15-17, West would doubtless have stayed low. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Changing the 10,8 to the q,j on the hand above yields 17.5 points, still low but more reasonable.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Weinstein didn't even search for a 5-3 spade fit.  He judged that with 3-3 in hearts and clubs it was very unlikely that spades would take 2 more tricks than notrump, ...|pg||
nt|kit: which would be needed for 4@S to significantly gain over 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point.|pg||
nt|yke:  3NT is questionable to me. with a 5-3 fit you should play in spades when the long spades is the weak hand and in NT when the long spades is the strong hand|pg||
nt|yke:  because you might not be able to enjoy the long spades because of the entries|pg||
nt|kit: with AQx of clubs, there is no entry problem to the long spades|pg||
nt|yke:  good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: At matchpoints there would be more incentive to look for a 5-3 spade fit, since making 1 extra trick in spades is worth something.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  ah! a variation :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s is a strong 1-suiter, |pg||
pc|h4|nt|rhelle:  although why North wants to play a @s contract himself is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well South africa has bid it and made it|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  now...... sign of or low @d lead...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ai ... North may pass 4@s now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle:  I still think North would have done better to keep relay'ing|pg||
nt|brolucius: West at the other table did try to cash two spades against 5@S doubled and allowed the game to be made. |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one down against 4@S making in the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart five in north could possibly have been promoted to a trick with persistence in diamonds after cashing clubs.  The play is complex|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: very quick @H9|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking that if he doesn't overtake this and cash the @DK for a spade pitch, the defence can draw trumps and cash two spades|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case the nine was a poor choice because it opens him to the promotion.|pg||
nt|athene: but the trick comes back for the defence with a trump promotion in diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, he is always losing out one way or another - even if he didn't waste the nine, the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|athene: for example on a diamond if he can ruff high north can pitch a club and get a club ruff with the @H5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but, let's be honest, it's a marginal slam. Around 50%, so staying out of it is no shame|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: 5@C doubled, I mean.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|boedhy:  and the small @d lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: Note the diamond ten, calling for a club (and why did north not play the spade queen on that first spade trick to show possession of the jack?)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: anyway, a game swing back to bulgaria when duboin made a costly lead of @CA from AQJ against the 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: to be fair, it was harder for him to lead a heart when declarer had actually bid the suit|pg||

nt|santyclz: One of the few hands where blackwood answers all your questions.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players use it as game-forcing rather than 'limit or better'.|pg||

nt|boedhy:  yes|pg||
nt|boedhy:  the fact that he could lead the @s ten|pg||

mb|3C|nt|santyclz: So much for 3nt by n...|pg||

pc|h4|nt|rensph:  Creative approach by W - had east shown a 5card major he'd be ok with that, too|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: So the auction, say, 1nt - 2@d (gfs) - 2@s - 3@s offers a choice of contract.|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  sort of wrongsided it now|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||

nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
nt|athene: he really has not got that much defence|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case, north might sit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||

nt|athene: versace wondering whether to start clubs with small towards the ten i suppose|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the session. I would like to thank Dirk, our splendid VG operator. Excellent session and many thanks!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|boedhy:  4nt quantitative|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, unless you're in 6NT and you get the wrong lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  could be 12 tricks played from East|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rensph:  3@C puppet stayman here, little to the play in 4@S> Declarer will draw trumps and then requires the @HK to be onside|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rensph:  he might be able to play for a throw-in|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Also, many thanks to Kit and Joe, my fellow commentators. We were awarded a fair bunch of boards - neither excellent, nor hopelessly boring - somewhere in between.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rensph:  should the throw-in fail (If S holds the 3rd spade) he can still finesse the hearts himself|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|kareno: This is a hand I would rather leave to partner to declare always - too many choices.  I agree that a club to the ten is tempting.  The diamonds have opened a path for the defense.|pg||

nt|vugraphzns: again 3nt seems better contract|pg||
nt|jdonn: 4@s here is on the spade guess, which it seems normal to get wrong but we shall see|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: lauria versace found it|pg||
nt|jdonn: the heart lead showing shortness may be a clue, implying more length in the other suits including spades|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jdonn: well i should say, the bidding and the lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: the @s 9 might confirm or infirm his intuition|pg||
nt|jdonn: if he finesses the spade now he will lose a spade but make it|pg||
nt|jdonn: since he will be able to throw a diamond loser on the clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vbman: yes|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|vbman: if seven is a correct card|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jdonn: its hard to say what the right play was, north might have been falsecarding from 9x of spades|pg||
nt|jdonn: but Q9 was certainly possible|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but who would play @s7 from 76x with no apparent reason to?|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean, as SP|pg||
nt|jdonn: i think south can play his spades pretty randomly|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|nt|ritong: possible|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s6|mc|8|nt|ritong: i tend to think, however, that real tough guys, and justin is no doubt one, do not falsecard that deep, in general|pg||
nt|vbman: a nightmare like session for ew has ended|pg||
nt|jdonn: don't see what happened but it could have gone down 2, getting their heart ruff eventually|pg||
pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|boedhy:  throwing imps like candy..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board, we start again at 13.45|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: that is in 1 hour|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes do you know there agreements|pg||
nt|rhelle:  they play dstructive preempts this vul(doesn't everybody?)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  what is the range|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but the temptation to bid 6@c must be strong|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt overcall perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: would be interesting to see how lauria-versace handle such interference|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  getting to 6@d now is too hard, I think|pg||
nt|rensph:  Even if spades break 4-1 taking the ace and returning a spade works equally well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: So many thanks to Bob Drijver our excellent Operator.  To the specs for their wit and wisdom.  To Bill Frisby for his contributions and, of course, to WBF for allowing us to watch ...|pg||
nt|kareno: their marvelous production of the world championships.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|rhelle:  4@d may be an artificial slam try in @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will bid 5@c now expecting @h points|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally, this double shows a desire to penalize opps, but my guess is EW just use it to show some values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The next session starts in around 1 hours and 10 minutes. It will be the last session of the day.|pg||
nt|kit: This time it is right to play the 5-3 major-suit fit|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even promising spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board for the day, back tomorrow at 10.30 Paris time|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  still liking his hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rensph:  in this layout it all mattered very little, had north held the @HK it would've been a very effective @SQ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|boedhy:  now pass finally|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good sequence - 5@c is again 50% at best|pg||
nt|boedhy:  slam again 50% or so|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North: you guys have a bit of a @h fit|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, you'd better reserve your seats for the entire tournament - there is much wonderful bridge coming up!!|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rensph:  3N is made on a heart lead and continuation here, but if defenders set up a diamond trick early on declarer will still have to find the @SQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  I'm also informed that lauria made 4@S on this hand|pg||
nt|rensph:  3NT, sorry|pg||
nt|jacksond: if plays donde for spade queen he makes quite easily|pg||
nt|rensph:  sorry, 3N making with clubs 3-3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: North realised that his partner must have had some purpose in bidding 2@C checkback. When it turned out that he was not looking for four hearts, he knew that he must have been ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: looking for a 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|boedhy:  and offcourse this one is down on @s lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  thinking about it, 6@c is down on a @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: 10 easy tricks with spades splitting, but only 8 in notrump|pg||

nt|kareno: So that's it and Italy will get most or all of the VPs for this match.  Well done!!|pg||
nt|rensph:  lets see how declarer handles 4@S here though|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|boedhy:  well good start for the Netherlands...and with all these difficult and lively boards fun to watch|pg||
