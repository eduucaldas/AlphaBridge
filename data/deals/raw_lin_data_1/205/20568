mb|1S|nt|lml: David Lindop is thinking how many spades|pg||
nt|desinka: hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desita :)|pg||
nt|desinka: the best one.. but lets see the contract..|pg||
nt|desinka: Hey, Momchil@h|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H is not making but in this vul it is hard for N to let it go|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: live scores under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|lml: of course a double by north-south would have worked well but that was hard to do|pg||
nt|ady: tht there may be a problem|pg||
mb|6D|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Apparently they were not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: anybody see anyway to double 4@S?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|star6ija: assuming that 3@cs establishes GF, 3@h maybe sounds more or less natural|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: nice play|pg||
nt|lml: no peeking!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they know ... now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||
nt|star6ija: I like Martel's way of bidding|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: so far canada has been the aggressor and it has worked|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|kit: yes, certainly Martel could have bid 3@S rather than 3@D, but they should have survived.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|lml: they stole the contract on board 2 in 2@D|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lml: and here they pushed north-south too high|pg||

nt|desinka: I'm not sure what is 2@S...coz some of the bulgarian pairs play 2@S inv with no 4M and the asnwers are min and max|pg||
nt|kit: a lot easier for declarer to "double dummy" up king of hearts than for West to find that defense|pg||
nt|udo: agree,,,,only an idea:)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|udo: now,, its easy:)|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: I think E-W play attitude leads vs. NT, so from West's point of view his partner might have 5 hearts and the spade play an attempt to steal  9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|vugraphznu: From what I can make out from the writing, 2@S is inv with both minors|pg||

nt|desinka: thx,Bas|pg||
nt|kit: Levin trying to figure out if anything can matter -- since he holds 3 diamonds, he will realize that the defense must be done.|pg||
nt|kit: But declarer can't claim, since he doesn't know the diamonds are splitting.|pg||
nt|desinka: after 2 moves will claim:)|pg||
nt|desinka: 2-3|pg||
nt|kit: is Levin still in the tank?|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
mc|9|nt|kit: The diamond back seemed clear -- hoping his partner has queen of spades so declarer would have only 5 diamonds and 1 trick in each of the other suits|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: Levin: "Sorry (if) I insulted you by thinking." Not sure if he said if or not :)|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 6 @c .....|pg||
nt|lml: West will likely open a weak 2 in spades|pg||
nt|udo: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would open 2@C with east's hand for sure|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: then south might try 3@C maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Udo and wlc :)|pg||
nt|udo: i am at work, but will try to comment sometimes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would be 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: E hand is 3 loosers|pg||
nt|lml: he decided his spades were too weak for that|pg||
nt|udo: 3@D = inverted,,weak raise with good support,,quite common agreement nowadays|pg||
mb|2C|an|ALERTED|mb|p|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||
nt|lml: a matter of style|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is maybe inverted minor and 2N showing 15-17?|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphznv: bulgaria scored 10 on the slam hand|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: i would have overcalled 1@H with the north hand but pass is ok if your partner is there for you with a double|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|lml: wow ... well done north south|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: lol|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ron_sc2002: agree.. partner probably wont bid again so better to make pressure on E and bid directly 5@C|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: tricky too bid|pg||
nt|lml: it sure is|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|athene: north might have intended 4@C to say "you can save in 5@C if you like"|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ron_sc2002: and the defence made the same to beat 5@H|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: as the cards lie of course nothing can hurt a grand|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: well, north threw a trick, yes|pg||
nt|athene: he could have kept @DJ and the heart winner|pg||
nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
mb|1H|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
mb|1N|an|alerted|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt = @h fit|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: invitational values|pg||
nt|udo: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explained from Versace to Masood|pg||
nt|ady: around 1NT  loooks likely|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||
nt|famus: Hello Udo & William|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=12-14 EXCEPT  3rd seat vul = 15-17|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ron_sc2002: Pass is clearly forcing in this situation|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N has bid 6@s|pg||
nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||
nt|star6ija: complicate decision for Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Aronov will open 1N and Stefanov will bid  so  nobody stopping in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- does DBL now show 2@D?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they play 14-16 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|star6ija: I expected this bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
pc|dK|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
pc|d9|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so he does not have to take the @d decision|pg||
nt|lml: there may be a trump promotion on a diamond play now |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: but still i think @DK shift is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if the @CQ got covered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe it will be 1N in the other room|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s2|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|ady: cards lay well for declarer |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: discussion in bulgarian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i do not understand.... :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s2|nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
nt|ady: 1 trump out of the way|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|kemperg: he knows @CA with partner, so @DA on leader|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6 the auction was 1N-all pass|pg||
nt|star6ija: Karaivanov would be surprized realizing that Trendafilov still is not shorter in trumps than him|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lml: or a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice play|pg||
nt|udo: i think he should find the duck,,,he knows @D are running most of the time|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: and if declarer has the @DA, it is clear that playing ace and another trump just releases control and allows the diamonds to run|pg||
nt|ady: club ruff coming soon|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|athene: this is very often a problem for the defence - whether to draw trumps or not|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: when declarer is trying for a ruff but has a threatening side-suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: and underleading or ducking the ace of trumps is often the key|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugraphznv: blame me |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Weinstein did it well in board 7...almost equalized it :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a lesson there about signalling with card you can't afford to play|pg||
nt|ady: another part score hand   clubs likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the rest of the play correct...except the ten instead of the 5 at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|udo: will end in 3 NT, i think|pg||
nt|famus: well this wud certainly propel them higher than desired|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|udo: but cards dont lie very nice|pg||
nt|famus: 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead would be very nice|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Martel's 1@S showed either 5+@C or some shortness|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if north played 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he'd either open 1N with 12-14 or rebid 1N to show strong NT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: (nice for declarer, i mean) :)|pg||
nt|ady: can set up the hearts    but no entry with clubs 4-2   so should make just 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|famus: tuff transportation prblms|pg||
nt|athene: probably heart lead now, ducked|pg||
nt|udo: great lead,,,,,,,amazing how often they find best lead|pg||
nt|famus: duck 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: GREAT to watch such leads :)|pg||
nt|famus: dont blame NS to be in 3NT--how much they go down is moot|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: this looks to make with no problems with the clubs working|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 4-1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: 500 here without much bother; that's fine when your game is touch and go|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you lose 3 imps if they make the thin 4@S in the other room|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|lml: he should make an uptrick on the lie of the cards|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: but sometimes you gain 12 when it goes off|pg||
nt|athene: those are good odds for just taking the money|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|star6ija: there are some diffivulties|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: some might be wondering why it's so obvious for east to duck his @HA there at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Aronov in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||
nt|athene: it hurts declarer's transportation|pg||
nt|athene: and also helps your own|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: now EW can cash two hearts any time west gets in|pg||
nt|athene: if east won the first trick he couldn't attack hearts any more|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer would have a sure trick and an entry|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: now give up a spade if finesse wrong |pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein never bid where karaivanov-trendafilo wore out their red cards|pg||

nt|famus: vicious--but artful|pg||

nt|athene: ok i am told 4@C asks for keycards|pg||
nt|athene: if so, north won't be taking so long :) just a matter of counting four steps|pg||

nt|athene: and north has the well-known problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N shut his eys and looks to the ceiling... thinking|pg||
nt|athene: he has some extras but his only available cue-bid goes past game|pg||
nt|lml: so can west find the diamond lead ... the @DQ|pg||
nt|lml: north should bid 4@H here|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what 2NT would show?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N not convenient with partners bid, 4@h seems logical|pg||
nt|lml: I guess 19?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can't say, I assume so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass or correct for N|pg||
nt|lml: the Canadians had a bit of a strange auction on the previous board to end in 1@S|pg||

pc|h4|nt|athene: right, so i can believe THIS is keycard|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: missing @HJ10xx you cash the single honour first because you can only pick up 4-0 break one way|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you had the 10 you would cash the honour from hand first as you can pick up Jxxx in either hand|pg||

nt|athene: (i am sure bocchi madala will reach six)|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ady: 3NT  best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but south has the diamonds so it would have to be 6nt (or 6@S, but that is not likely)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H    totally new concept|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|famus: 6NT wud be great|pg||

nt|athene: lauria did not double 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: but the italians don't double these bids very often|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might still lead a club|pg||
nt|famus: i bet a @c lead|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|athene: can cash @SAK and play three rounds of trumps now to force east to give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw the club loser from dummy and ruff in hand but then dummy has only one trump to deal with two club losers|pg||
nt|athene: so one down|pg||

nt|athene: but if they aren't breaking, cashing them just sets up a trick or tricks for a defender|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finesse @ss now|pg||
nt|udo: @S to 9 and still interesting|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: guessed right    though perhaps a little luck;y|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, but ... if W has 4 trumps with 9 promotion is already done|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  11  Levin east overcalled artificial 1@C with 1@S|pg||
nt|ady: playing on hearts for 9th trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|famus: so 7 it is|pg||
nt|athene: easy for masood now; he knows his pd has the @DA entry to hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphznu: About 25 minutes remaining for four boards. A little bit behind schedule|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think they will miss slam here, with East overcalling and West having a mountain|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not the easist contract to bid after such a start|pg||
nt|desinka: i watch what is the contract in all tables..most of them play 6@S..|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|an|Pick a game (does not agree !S)|nt|kit: I think West will eventually just bid 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|an|Never really discussed Levin: naturalish|nt|desinka: the intresting in CR - Marten dont open 3@C.. so you have enough space to bid the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|an|KC !S|nt|kit: the slam isn't exactly cold, though you would want to be there|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: they will agrue abt that for sure :)|pg||
nt|desinka: Agree!|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|kit: Far from clear how to play 6@S, though most lines will probably lead to 12 tricks|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: On club lead, declarer might win and play jack of spades, which doesn't work well.  But I think he can recover with ruffing finesse in clubs, and eventualy red-suit squeeze on ...|pg||
nt|kit: South|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: Alternative approach is to try to ruff diamonds in dummy, but North might be short in diamonds.|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicked. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S"|pg||

nt|vugraphznu: Levin upset now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: He should continue with fourth round of spades, getting that trump out of South's hand before he gets involved in anything else|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|s8|nt|kit: But this is probably okay|pg||
nt|kit: South will be squeezed, and depending on the entry position Levin might wind up with a double squeeze for a sure thing.|pg||
nt|udo: chat chinese declarer played same way and was successfull in the end|pg||

nt|ehsana: 4S|pg||
nt|ritong: so far so good|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: NS play multi - maybe he thinks that hand is too strong for weak-two but too weak for 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
pc|h2|nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: best for declarer to play 2nd round of clubs from east hand|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|h7|pg||

pc|cA|nt|athene: but now the defence get the @DK set up too fast|pg||
