mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the NS system defines 2@C as 6+ with no 4M but maybe 5M, and 2@D=mini-multi [aka Wagner]|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: so 1@D opening covers a lot of territory|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: now Auken will definitely go  a-slammin|pg||
mb|4S|mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: some of you mentioning  Deas underlead of @D to get @C ruf|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ahollan1: but after 4@S  more likely they save against 6@H|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at this level of interferenced  usually DEPO instead of DOPI|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that means  DBL with Even  PASS with Odd  number of KC|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: When it';s above the trump suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of these conventions can be flip flopped too    DOPE  DEPO     DOPI DIPO etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected  save instead of double dummy defense against 6@H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if you normally lead A from AK   it makes sense at 5level or higher to revert to King from AK|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 2 reasons:  1) often lead unsupported ace  2) gets count in potential cashout situations|pg||

nt|roswolf: big misfit danger lurks for everyone|pg||
nt|rhelle: this looks more interesting|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rhelle: looks like EW can make 6@h, whereas NS have a good save (-1) in 6@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: that save has been found at the other table|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cicus: again not easy for NS to enter the bidding|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: no double - no trouble seems apt here|pg||
nt|cicus: as usual, the hand with shortness acts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|rhelle: 2@d is no doubt a transfer to @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: and rightly so since this will make on this layout|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, is that not a penalty bid?|pg||
nt|rhelle: lots of top players play transfers in these competitive situations|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: true, N had no means to invite|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rhelle: I'm told that 2@d is just a GF |pg||
mb|5D|nt|rhelle: I can see the logic of that - 6@c also looks a distinct possibility|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|cicus: still, with a passed partner you don't have to pursuit nonvul games|pg||
nt|rhelle: now, have they agreed what to do over intervention of 4NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2 popular schemes are DOPI-ROPI and DEPO-REPO|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: maybe he expected 5-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Double=0, Redouble=1 or Even / Odd|pg||
nt|rhelle: it seems they didn't quite understand each other|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|rhelle: so although EW miss slam, they still pick up 11 IMPs|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  so far so good, though 7th trick is to be found|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a large number of pairs in the Bermuda Bowl are playing  1m-(1@H)-1@S = 0-3@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for them  DBL = 4/5@S and they have other bids for 6+@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: that said, both red suits are so kind for declarer, that 3NT always makes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cicus: e.g. 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  2@H for INV+ and 2@S weak  is frequent treatment|pg||
nt|alunand14: 13 tricks now...........|pg||

nt|cicus: I cannot assess the merits of such an agreement but it is too popular to be bad|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my immediate reaction is that it has same benefit of all transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there is a large group - especially in north america  that wants to apply law of total tricks   so  Neg DBL = exactly 4@S and 1@S=5+|pg||
nt|cicus: that was a popular treatment here even before the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: can't tell why|pg||
nt|ahollan1: momentum|pg||
nt|rhelle: mmmm leading the @dQ is a losign play when South has the singleton K|pg||

pc|h2|nt|roswolf: seems a strange decision at trick 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: fortunately the @CA is right|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer needs to "unblock" the spade ace next|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cicus: 6@H is the right target - trump losers may be a problem if spades are chosen|pg||
nt|farrukh: if i remember these relays correctly, N has shown 6+@s in a balanced hand and his controls, either in standard way or in zz terms|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: my guess about 2@D response came from Nystrom-Bertheau Supplementary Notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assumed same relay structure even though they use different opening 2-bids|pg||
nt|cicus: upmark-cullin system notes (page 4) confirm your explanation, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 7   Nystrom-Bertheau got shut out of @S, sold to 2@C South  and Pakistan on the board with 11 imps|pg||
nt|farrukh: if S is thinking so long there may have been some glitch in the relays|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s4|nt|cicus: as I said I think this is slightly inferior to 6@H but OK now|pg||

nt|alunand14: lah, menang @S mestinya cabut trump dulu ?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: now declarer will have a sinking feeling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H in other room|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cicus: two playing options here - either draw trumps and hope @Hs come in or try to ruff a @D then draw trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since both majors split 32  i think this makes -- just make sure to win this trick in hand that ensures reentry to dummy|pg||

nt|rhelle: declarer has 5 trump tricks, 3 @c, 1@s|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: there is a toiletbreak now, they will be back in a few minutes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and they are all back now.|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a deserved 10 IMPs to Germany, IMHO|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: they play 3 sets per day with short breaks between matches  but then get to enjoy the evening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a wonderful concept|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: many would have overcalled an offshape 1NT here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: standard bidding, 2 @s will be the end contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or 1@S|pg||

nt|glen: hopefully they can use 2NT here to get to 5-3 @C fit|pg||
nt|glen: or pass|pg||

nt|roswolf: good point glen|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: hmm, I expected 4@S from S but the vulnerability biased him|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: still 3@C is not good with no ruffing value in the S hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: oeps, this can get nasty|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: 4@S??  at which point|pg||
nt|rhelle: A delicate 2NT contract|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: immediately over the double|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  proper contract (if only NS hands in consideration), and hardly found @cA lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to find without clues from the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: another chance now for the defense|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: balancing double  =  never jump to game   not to mention hasn't guaranteed 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: I did not consider passing, but also did not look at the colours|pg||
nt|cicus: you are right, 4 spades were not guaranteed|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: Nystrom opened East hand  1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ahmed playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand much easier to play seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|cicus: very true - drawing trumps results in only 8 tricks if @S do not break|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  apparently, N couldn't have singleton @c after 1NT opening|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|glen: EW have a zillion years of experience and they know there's blood in the water|pg||
nt|glen: hence everything by NS will get X'ed|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for bidding 3NT as South|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  so, E has to find a way|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: trying to think single dummy ....   want to preserve QJ  so  win dummy @H to Ace, @C finesse     i think|pg||

nt|cicus: S was extremely conservative in OR|pg||

mb|3D|nt|roswolf: true glen|pg||
nt|glen: better to X 3@S to show support|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: but I am ultra aggressive in such situations, those not so crazy would bid only 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  first step done. what about the play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i think normal play is to get hearts wrong|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  there is no problem with @s guess - the A must be onside. the problem is in guessing @h correctly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: as playing heart to the jack also caters with AQx onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 3nt is expl. as balanced, 12,13pt|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzpb: 11 tricks from top with club A gone, 12 with spade finesse|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4 losers in the red suits - defence need to take their @s trick before it goes on @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle: great lead!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't object to 1@S, 2@S or 3@S in this situation|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  though, I can hardly imagine N's reasoning|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but well done by palmer to give them a chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: south will have shown her diamond count, so north's only chance was to cash @cA|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 1@H max of 15 HCP|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|cicus: but you saw that Mohiudd bid it first :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=good raise of @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|glen: never accept the trojan club|pg||
nt|rhelle: that is a red-blooded 2@c overcall|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: after bd 25 25-11 to India|pg||
mb|p|nt|alunand14: small slam from N|pg||
nt|rhelle: after this sequence, North can envisage @c shortage in her partner's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S had a re-double in her hand and then decided for 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: still, 4@h is a bit lazy, with this fine-looking hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c is normally invitational or better - so it sets @h as trump suit|pg||
nt|rhelle: which means XX to show 1st round control looks perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: what would 3@S by S have meant??|pg||
nt|rhelle: we can see that 6@s is perhaps a superior contract|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|vugraphzpb: but then cashing @cA also isn't wrong, the 3rd spade will go on the @dJ|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s is natural, I'd think|pg||

mb|6D|nt|ahollan1: 3@H was not invitational|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|glen: a 9 count 2/1 in the open room got EW to 3NT|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|glen: 2@H had some risk in a potential misfit auction, there was no way N was bidding again|pg||
nt|roswolf: with screens hesitations are less likely to cause adjustments|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it is about thinking of N and thereafter bidding of S of 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is present bud bidding is not ended....|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: W raises his hands on pass of S after 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a wild shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: pass cards of W are not in sequential order on the tray, TD is now called by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as south  - west has lost his cool|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: again fireworks?|pg||
nt|glen: sometimes you need to "calm the fuss down" to think clearly, but the fireworks can be distracting|pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand is all about the @CK|pg||

nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 8-11?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision opening bids for EW    1@D should be 2+   2@C=6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they've made 2@C DENY 4 card major  i'm checking cc now|pg||
nt|3for3: i dont think they play 1@D guarantees 2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, hope, kibs enjoyed comparing the matter of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3NT can't be beaten here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: chance now to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but east has a minimum, at least in my book|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: maybe west should have bid it already|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a vulnerable overcall at 2-level should show a good hand in my opinion|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ open team were in 5@D making|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|farrukh: so it seems that there may be some ruling involved looking at the bidding and the table score for board 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right Danny -- they play 2@D=mini-multi|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: i thought other room played 6@H  but movie showing 4@H|pg||

nt|rhelle: as the axe was getting perilously close to her neck |pg||

nt|ritong: benedicte could try the cue in pard's known shortness|pg||
nt|rhelle: on repeated trump leads, this may not be fun either|pg||
nt|rhelle: and what do we do against doubled partscores, boys and girls? We lead trumps|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: but..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s = 3 card spades|pg||
nt|farrukh: but now either it is operator error or Director's ruling, so we'll get the update shortly|pg||
nt|ritong: you never know|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzpb: to pick up a few imps, instead of losing 11 if New Zealand would have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: excellent!|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh   6@H moved back to 4@H was the adjustment|pg||
nt|farrukh: in fact most likely its a director's ruling because the score showed a pushed board and then it changed later|pg||
