nt|athene:  declarer's problem here is untangling his nine tricks of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|kit: it may look like 9 easy tricks now, but how does declarer collect his heart winners?|pg||
nt|athene:  if he just takes the obvious route and knocks out the diamond ace, then a club shift leaves him a bit stuck|pg||
nt|athene:  the @SQ is an entry|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eggy: This isn't that clearcut - looks like declarer nneeds to play spades first|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: so he has to take the unobvious route of unblocking hearts and a low spade|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene:  but north can jump up with the king and cash clubs|pg||

nt|eggy: not now though|pg||

nt|eggy: but if S had ducked the 2nd diamond?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kfay: I think that Steve is far more likely to have led from the minor in which he holds an honor than one where he doesn't.  If he didn't hold the @dA he'd be leading a club usually.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: Declarer would know who had the ace of diamonds after the 2nd round of diamonds|pg||
nt|kfay: So I'd tend to agree with the voice commentary.  Much more likely you can set up a suit where you have help for partner than expecting them to flesh our your 3 small.|pg||
nt|kit: not unexpectedly 4@S failed in other room, giving usa2 a nice start|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kit: excellent 6@D contract here -- might not be so easy to bid.  North's hand is primish, and the 2NT rebid doesn't suggest that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene:  responder uses transfers after the 2NT rebid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kfay: 3@c was a puppet to 3@D, 4@d was a raise and 4@H is RKC|pg||
nt|athene:  of course he isn't rightsiding diamonds, but transfers have other advantages|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kit: They will get to slam now -- Levin has a huge hand compared to what he might hold.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene:  usually it is not recommended to use blackwood with a void unless you know for sure that partner either has, or has not, the ace in your void suit|pg||
nt|eggy: I reckon that N can just about count the tricks now though|pg||
nt|kit: pretty difficult to rightside diamonds after 1@D opening|pg||
nt|athene:  but when south finds his partner with four keys, he is ok :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene:  ah, ok, i am told it's north who used blackwood - that makes a lot more sense|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kit: and he chose the third :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kit: Problem with 2@D is that he has to come again and pretty much force to game|pg||
nt|athene:  yes, and that is overstating his hand|pg||
nt|eggy: 2D doesn't seem to be that helpful really, you'd have thought it would guarantee a club fit wouldn;t you?|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C just might handle|pg||
nt|athene:  well traditionally, double-then-cue was just a game force, but people don't usually play it that way these days|pg||
nt|kit: seems like he has to bid his spade suit now|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT comes home also|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene:  i don't see how south can bid anything but 3nt now? you just need @CQxxxx with partner?|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will try 3NT -- needs only Qxxxx of clubs and out for that to make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: Good decision by Weinstein to suppress his spade suit -- although it didn't have to work out|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|nt|athene: but maybe that is penalty if you think 4@H defined west's hand quite closely|pg||

mb|d|mb|r|nt|athene: 2@C then some action now shows it quite nicely though :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: i was expecting 3@C maybe over the double|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, always nice when opponents cooperate|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kit: I think Wooldridge can bid 5@C now|pg||
nt|eggy: could well take a shot at it now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, now he knows his partner has a fourth club, which makes a huge difference|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W happen to be able to make 6@C with some good luck and some good guessing, but bidding 5@C will be enough to win a decent swing.|pg||
nt|athene: to pass 2@C, east could be 1-5-4-3 or something horrible|pg||
nt|eggy: If for no other reason than the inward gloating opportunity if it makes :)|pg||
nt|athene: but the way it's gone he surely has a much better dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Since Kxxx of clubs and nothing else gives decent play for 5@C, seems like a clear call to me.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|kit: This is just plain cutting things too fine I think|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think 4@C is a bit of a "partner torturing" bid|pg||
nt|eggy: surely there's a more helpful bid that 4C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt, pass 2@C, but then volunteering a free 3@C - that has to show east's hand quite narrowly|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: so you should take charge|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: Here we have a very reasonable slam, which in practice will likely make as East will probably lead ace of diamonds|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: if you have a control-bidding sequence that pinpoints north has no diamond control and south has a control, east *might* find the small diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: this auction is a typical start|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: north denied diamond control, so now if south makes any forward-going move, he has to have the @DK|pg||
nt|kit: Some are suggesting low diamond lead.  I think that is double-dummy.  North figures to have king of diamonds if either opponent does, and partner might have stiff|pg||
nt|kfay: This is an interesting spot and one that comes up often in Bridge World bidding problems.  What does 4X mean after 2@C-2@D; 2M-3M?  For N/S I'm pretty sure it shows a real 2nd ...|pg||
nt|kfay: suit.  To get around the problems that causes in cuebidding they use 3NT to show a few hands including a single-suited spade slamtry|pg||
nt|athene: well, he could have a singleton, but he didn't splinter over 2@S, so that is unlikely|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|kit: 4NT RKC, 5@C 1 or 4, 5D asks for queen of trumps, 5@H says yes and king of hearts I believe|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: yes|pg||
nt|kit: Well, if North's 4@H call really denies a diamond control then low diamond lead is at least possible|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen east is not scared to back his judgement taking a slightly "non-obvious" view, when he bid 3nt with 4-4 spade fit a few boards ago|pg||
nt|kit: But can you trust the opponents that much?|pg||
nt|athene: that is true of all USA2|pg||
nt|athene: so i think small diamond is definite possibility|pg||

mb|6N|nt|kit: Weinstein thinking of bidding 6Nt to protect a king|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Well you know them best Kit, but Levin plays a fairly straight bat doesn;y he?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but which king can he be protecting?|pg||
nt|kit: And so he did -- but now he will have to guess the diamonds himself|pg||
nt|kit: oh right -- North is declarer|pg||
nt|athene: north is playing the notrumps as well as the spades|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: come on, 4th best of longest|pg||
nt|kit: I'll bet Weinstein may have forgotten that also|pg||
nt|athene: boink :) told you|pg||
nt|athene: north might rise king yet of course|pg||
nt|kit: Easier to guess the diamonds on low lead vs. 6NT than vs. 6@S|pg||
nt|kfay: Leading away from the @dQ would scare me a lot more than leading away from the @dA on this hand|pg||
nt|eggy: Now which is more likely in this auction? underleading the Q or the Ace|pg||
nt|kit: I think vs. 6NT more likely to underlead ace than queen, so I expect he will get it right.|pg||
nt|athene: if he guesses right, the @S7 is the entry to untangle 12 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: Note 7 of spades needed entry to get king of clubs|pg||
nt|eggy: I agree it's the ace, but NS could so easily have 12 tricks on top, so I think that you'd have to lead from either.|pg||
nt|athene: you might lead a diamond from the queen here hoping to find pd with @DK and a spade entry?|pg||
nt|kit: Lead from queen more dangerous than from ace here, so I think he should go right.|pg||
nt|athene: north is thinking about the auction, i suspect|pg||
nt|athene: thinking "what has our auction told east - has it made it very appealing for him to underlead?"|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: sure - or even Kxx and Jx|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Levin did not have penalty double available over 1NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: I think they play Rusinow leads vs. NT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: yes their card says Q from KQxx, K asks for unblock or count|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: @DQ, trying to force an entry to his partner's hand?|pg||
nt|eggy: Was there a case for that card @ST at T3?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: Levin still stuck in -- will probably shift to diamond now, hoping partner has ace|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|eggy: It's not as clear inthese days of opening 1NT with a five card Major, but still looked a bit tempting|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: when you defend 1nt you have to remember, one suit alone isn't going to get the job done|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: Now a different problem -- if declarer has 3 diamonds, need to duck.|pg||
nt|kit: Which I think he will do.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|eggy: and ifLevin is in again - he probably needs to try C2 |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|athene: north doesn't want to duck and then get endplayed with the next diamond|pg||
nt|kit: Levin just making sure he defeats the contract|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if west had @CK for example instead of the queen|pg||
nt|kfay: Live scoring from all the matches (Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup, and is available at bridgewinners.com  The scores are presented there in |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: He doesn't know the goal is to collect extra undertricks.  Since his partner clearly marked with a club honor, this defense will always defeat contract|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s7|nt|kfay: victory points.  To convert the scores back to IMPs you can use the chart here: http://www.bridgeguys.com/WGlossary/WBFconversion.html|pg||
nt|athene: well, he doesn't know that it makes no difference what he does :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: he is losing either 600 or 700 points on the hand :)|pg||

nt|athene: 67-0 after 10 boards|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|kit: I wonder about that 3@D call with Axx of spades.  Maybe should have simply bid 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: Problem is that Weinstein wasn't sure his Qxx was sufficient stopper.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: 5@D will probably make, but not at all sure -- and 3NT a lot more secure|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kit: I think 4@H may be RKC, so they could be in slam here|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Well, on a spade lead it can come home -- and that might be the lead|pg||
nt|athene: no lightner double (heart lead) from east - he knows on the bidding south probably has short hearts |pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't feel that a heart lead is going to be killing, necessarily|pg||
nt|kit: since 5@D showed 2 with queen of trumps, might punt with a trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: it might be useful to warn partner off a costly lead in spades, though?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: since one pitch won't help, I think he will go up king of hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Everybody laughing at contract, but if East had queen of clubs this would likely be making|pg||
nt|athene: yes, although it is far less likely that west has underled here|pg||
nt|eggy: He's done well and East will know from the 4H bid the position|pg||
nt|athene: since south is very likely to have 3-1-5-4 or so|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how playing low can every gain|pg||
nt|athene: no, it can't|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: no point even keeping the @HK as a menace against east because if he has the @CQ you make with the finesse anyway|pg||
nt|eggy: To be fair, this only requires the club finesse and trumps not 4-0|pg||
nt|kit: Now will just take club finesse and go down|pg||
nt|kit: no, probably need trumps 2-2, since need 7 trumps, 4 clubs, 1 spade|pg||

nt|athene: the point is you can't possibly want to bid hearts naturally but you might have a huge diamond suit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: some might consider using the two cues to differentiate between 3- and 4-card raises|pg||
nt|athene: but with 4-card support you can go to the 3-level|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|athene: then declarer would be short of an entry for enough heart ruffs|pg||
nt|ritong: @d Q on was close to certainty|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ritong: if needed|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kfay: 2NT is game forcing, balanced hand|pg||
nt|kit: After the 2NT (forcing) call, Levin will be thinking club slam|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: If they get to slam, opening lead will be critical.  Diamond lead defeats it outright.  Other leads, declarer has a chance (I think) if he reads the position.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kit: Weinstein will accept will all these primes I think|pg||
nt|kit: 6NT also has chance of course|pg||
nt|kit: I think vs. 6NT Wooldridge will go passive with club lead -- he knows his partner can't have much.|pg||
nt|kit: In real life, on club lead I can't see declarer doing anything but diamond to king.|pg||
nt|athene: yes you can make slam double dummy on a passive lead|pg||
nt|athene: lead a spade from south|pg||
nt|athene: west has to split, then you strip squeeze him in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: piece of cake|pg||
nt|ritong: much superior to @d ace on:)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|kit: Weinstein has minimal point count, and no source of tricks.  But he does have those nice primes.  I think he should go.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Predicted one right.  Now, let's see how I do on the opening lead.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: a @c seems indicated|pg||
nt|kit: 2 for 2.  Now if only Weinstein can make my third prediction wrong.|pg||
nt|athene: against 6 of a suit, it's normal to lead aggressively|pg||
nt|athene: so when someone leads a trump that is often revealing|pg||
nt|athene: but against 6nt, you normally lead passively|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't think south can read much into this lead|pg||
nt|kit: One point about winning opening lead and playing diamond to king at trick 2.  If West has AJx, he just might duck, figuring declarer for KQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||

nt|ritong: or AQ|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: east might not split from @DQJxx|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: so it might go to king and ace then you recover by squeezing east if he had @SQJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: might have some return on last board  we will see that|pg||
nt|athene: many people would bid 3@H over 3@C with that hand, but you are meant to have more big cards for an overcall of a pre-empt|pg||
nt|athene: south might have visions of @CAK opposite and 7@C|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what sort of trump asking bids they have|pg||
nt|kit: good hand for grand slam force if can show exact holding|pg||
nt|ritong: @c suit is often problematic|pg||
nt|athene: some people use modified responses to grand slam force to show exact holdings|pg||
nt|athene: but not usually when clubs are the trump suit|pg||
nt|kit: 6@C down on spade lead though, and if Hurd finds out about void he could lead it.|pg||
nt|athene: hard to lead a singleton against a slam when you hold AK|pg||
nt|athene: not impossible if south bids in such a way as to show the heart void|pg||
