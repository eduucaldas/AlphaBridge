nt|yuval10: perhaps the only possible case in which it won't apply is when South has A@c singelton, and that's what makes W thinks|pg||

nt|fluffy: the 2 diamonds can get rid on many ways, ruffing in dummy, setting hearts or doing something with clubs or a combo of all|pg||
nt|fluffy: and of top of that he doesn't yet know if he needs to do anything because maybe @sK is just onside and there is no trump loser|pg||
