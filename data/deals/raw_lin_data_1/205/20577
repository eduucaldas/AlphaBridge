nt|vugraphzpb: 8-11?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision opening bids for EW    1@D should be 2+   2@C=6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they've made 2@C DENY 4 card major  i'm checking cc now|pg||
nt|3for3: i dont think they play 1@D guarantees 2|pg||
mb|3H|nt|farrukh: so it seems that there may be some ruling involved looking at the bidding and the table score for board 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right Danny -- they play 2@D=mini-multi|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: i thought other room played 6@H  but movie showing 4@H|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ritong: but..|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s = 3 card spades|pg||
nt|farrukh: but now either it is operator error or Director's ruling, so we'll get the update shortly|pg||
nt|ritong: you never know|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh   6@H moved back to 4@H was the adjustment|pg||
nt|farrukh: in fact most likely its a director's ruling because the score showed a pushed board and then it changed later|pg||
