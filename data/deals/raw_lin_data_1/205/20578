nt|lml: north=south have a heart ruff here|pg||

mb|p|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desita :)|pg||
nt|desinka: the best one.. but lets see the contract..|pg||
nt|desinka: Hey, Momchil@h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H is not making but in this vul it is hard for N to let it go|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: live scores under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: of course a double by north-south would have worked well but that was hard to do|pg||
nt|ady: tht there may be a problem|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: Apparently they were not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: anybody see anyway to double 4@S?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|star6ija: assuming that 3@cs establishes GF, 3@h maybe sounds more or less natural|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: nice play|pg||
nt|lml: no peeking!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they know ... now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||
nt|star6ija: I like Martel's way of bidding|pg||
nt|stoffers: Loosing a couple of diamonds and maybe one spade here, more coffee :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: so far canada has been the aggressor and it has worked|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|nt|kit: yes, certainly Martel could have bid 3@S rather than 3@D, but they should have survived.|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 6 @c .....|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: i would open 2@C with east's hand for sure|pg||

nt|udo: i am at work, but will try to comment sometimes|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ron_sc2002: E hand is 3 loosers|pg||
nt|lml: he decided his spades were too weak for that|pg||
nt|udo: 3@D = inverted,,weak raise with good support,,quite common agreement nowadays|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||
nt|lml: a matter of style|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is maybe inverted minor and 2N showing 15-17?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bulgaria scored 10 on the slam hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|athene: i would have overcalled 1@H with the north hand but pass is ok if your partner is there for you with a double|pg||

mb|2D|nt|athene: well, north threw a trick, yes|pg||
nt|athene: he could have kept @DJ and the heart winner|pg||
nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||
nt|famus: Hello Udo & William|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|ron_sc2002: Pass is clearly forcing in this situation|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N has bid 6@s|pg||
nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||
nt|star6ija: complicate decision for Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Aronov will open 1N and Stefanov will bid  so  nobody stopping in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- does DBL now show 2@D?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they play 14-16 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|star6ija: I expected this bid|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Only lived in Denmark last 31 years, being an Icelander|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
pc|dK|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
pc|h3|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so he does not have to take the @d decision|pg||
nt|lml: there may be a trump promotion on a diamond play now |pg||
nt|stoffers: Ah, nice|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|athene: but still i think @DK shift is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if the @CQ got covered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe it will be 1N in the other room|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|s5|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: they play upside down|pg||

nt|ady: cards lay well for declarer |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|h4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: can bring down K@H in 3   but cant play a spade from north at the same time|pg||

nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: If one of the pairs finds out they will ofcource correct the score|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||
nt|stoffers: Duboin knowing about a diamondlooser now (no 4@d)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||

mb|1S|nt|lml: and canada went ahead ... but with a lot of luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 10-12 1NT|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Weinstein did it well in board 7...almost equalized it :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a lesson there about signalling with card you can't afford to play|pg||
nt|ady: another part score hand   clubs likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the rest of the play correct...except the ten instead of the 5 at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|udo: will end in 3 NT, i think|pg||
nt|famus: well this wud certainly propel them higher than desired|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|udo: but cards dont lie very nice|pg||
nt|famus: 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead would be very nice|pg||
nt|skaftij:  and reached it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C  gazilli,  2@S less than 8  no 3@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = 15+|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: Martel's 1@S showed either 5+@C or some shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: or natural|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: if north played 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he'd either open 1N with 12-14 or rebid 1N to show strong NT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: (nice for declarer, i mean) :)|pg||
nt|ady: can set up the hearts    but no entry with clubs 4-2   so should make just 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|famus: tuff transportation prblms|pg||
nt|athene: probably heart lead now, ducked|pg||
nt|udo: great lead,,,,,,,amazing how often they find best lead|pg||
nt|famus: duck 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: GREAT to watch such leads :)|pg||
nt|famus: dont blame NS to be in 3NT--how much they go down is moot|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: this looks to make with no problems with the clubs working|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 4-1|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: 500 here without much bother; that's fine when your game is touch and go|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you lose 3 imps if they make the thin 4@S in the other room|pg||
pc|s9|nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|nt|lml: he should make an uptrick on the lie of the cards|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|star6ija: there are some diffivulties|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: some might be wondering why it's so obvious for east to duck his @HA there at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Aronov in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||
nt|athene: it hurts declarer's transportation|pg||
nt|athene: and also helps your own|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: now EW can cash two hearts any time west gets in|pg||
nt|athene: if east won the first trick he couldn't attack hearts any more|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer would have a sure trick and an entry|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: now give up a spade if finesse wrong |pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein never bid where karaivanov-trendafilo wore out their red cards|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lml: is this a safer line?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|athene: some people play 4@D shows this sort of hand -very strong suit with support for partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok i am told 4@C asks for keycards|pg||
nt|athene: if so, north won't be taking so long :) just a matter of counting four steps|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@C is a splinter in fact|pg||
nt|athene: and north has the well-known problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N shut his eys and looks to the ceiling... thinking|pg||
nt|athene: he has some extras but his only available cue-bid goes past game|pg||
nt|lml: so can west find the diamond lead ... the @DQ|pg||
nt|lml: north should bid 4@H here|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what 2NT would show?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N not convenient with partners bid, 4@h seems logical|pg||
nt|lml: I guess 19?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can't say, I assume so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass or correct for N|pg||
nt|lml: the Canadians had a bit of a strange auction on the previous board to end in 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt and 4@h should not make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: still, he has such a nice hand, i think he SHOULD go past game|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: complimenting Bjarni on his average dummy putting :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: right, so i can believe THIS is keycard|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: claim and toilet break|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: missing @HJ10xx you cash the single honour first because you can only pick up 4-0 break one way|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|athene: if you had the 10 you would cash the honour from hand first as you can pick up Jxxx in either hand|pg||

nt|athene: (i am sure bocchi madala will reach six)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT  best spot|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: NS play multi - maybe he thinks that hand is too strong for weak-two but too weak for 1@S|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: will west offer notrumps, or just bash in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he surely must bid SOME game, with a good 17 count facing drury|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: why not?|pg||
nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||

nt|ritong: yes, and @h K might be a falsecard with KJx|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: and declarer will make this one - is my guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
pc|s5|nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now, it be even go 2 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will surely ditch a @h|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||

nt|skaftij:  2 times @c|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H for e/w looks the spot|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|skaftij:  Thank you all kibs for good comments, I was not able to bring all forwards |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||

mb|4C!|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
