nt|vugraphznu: hi Andy welcome|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  4@s most likely spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: an easy 4@S  although EW may try to defend 2@hx|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|andyv:  hi Kit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznu: wlc Kit|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein was rooting for aa takeout double which he could pass -- which Levin might well have chosen, planning on converting 3@C to 3@S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N a bit more nervous contract|pg||
nt|kit: key is whether North leads his suit or his partner's vs. 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N doesn't have too many entries|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S can be beaten as more awake kibbers have pointed out not so sure its as easy for the players |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  only 7 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|kit: With this lead, 3NT is immediately defeated|pg||
nt|mamos: this however looks an easier defence|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|andyv:  Weinstein did have a tough call....soft values and 3 stoppers in overcaller's suit|pg||
nt|kit: South's 3 of clubs return is either his only remaining club or he has 4, so North could have won and continued.|pg||

nt|kit: Or South might split, thinking he is ensuring a trump trick.|pg||

mb|p|nt|stoffers: Hi all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: 11 tricks looks ok for e/w|pg||
nt|stoffers: So, Italy has started in great fashion (as usual), but iceland has some work to do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: 1@H was a bid of convenience for West|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S would be off, losing 2@H+@S+@C=4 tricks for the defence.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: especially because he has a nice way to get out in 2@d|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: hello|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: but I suppose the vulnerability was a disincentive|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: does 1@h show a 4 card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes, was the answer, normally|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: 2 black aces looks the only likely losers|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|athene: east's double obviously says "i want to bid 3@H, but i am doubling just in case you happen to have a big club stack,  so you can pass"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi William...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Ron|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lml: he couldnt support diamonds at the two-level with a weak bid|pg||
nt|lml: north=south have a heart ruff here|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT was balanced showing less than a strong notrump|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that's why it was asked, also if spade suit could be there|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|stoffers: Fine auction by the Italians here to the best contract, 650 and time for coffee|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: or not :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, so N smarter than us|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: 1NT = 14-17|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably the poor quality of the @hs was N's deciding factor but switch S's @hs and @ds and passing 2@h would not have been the winning action.|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe a little lucky  - NS have too much values concentrated in the minors as it happens|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|lml: David Lindop is thinking how many spades|pg||
nt|desinka: hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desita :)|pg||
nt|desinka: the best one.. but lets see the contract..|pg||
nt|desinka: Hey, Momchil@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H is not making but in this vul it is hard for N to let it go|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: live scores under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|lml: of course a double by north-south would have worked well but that was hard to do|pg||
nt|ady: tht there may be a problem|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|kit: Apparently they were not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: anybody see anyway to double 4@S?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|star6ija: assuming that 3@cs establishes GF, 3@h maybe sounds more or less natural|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ron_sc2002: nice play|pg||
nt|lml: no peeking!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they know ... now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||
nt|star6ija: I like Martel's way of bidding|pg||
nt|stoffers: Loosing a couple of diamonds and maybe one spade here, more coffee :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: so far canada has been the aggressor and it has worked|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: yes, certainly Martel could have bid 3@S rather than 3@D, but they should have survived.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: they stole the contract on board 2 in 2@D|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|lml: and here they pushed north-south too high|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: 4@Sater  was ambigious for me|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h seems to have a lot of play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Weinstein can project singleton heart in partner's hand, so right to compete to 3@C even with only 4 clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|mamos: would a forcing defence have prevailed?|pg||

nt|kit: if Weinstein had to follow to third round of spades declarer would make it, but now Weinstein ruff low, and declarer is a trick short.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm surprised Weinstein has a problem here -- seems like this should be straightforward defense.|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is maybe inverted minor and 2N showing 15-17?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: lol|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ron_sc2002: agree.. partner probably wont bid again so better to make pressure on E and bid directly 5@C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: would all of you have got to 6@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tricky too bid|pg||
nt|lml: it sure is|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|athene: north might have intended 4@C to say "you can save in 5@C if you like"|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: an established partnership like the Herbst have it easier because they know what to expect from each other|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: played on @S and @H 3/2. |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|wild card: but when you try to ruff your diamonds you only need spades 3/2 and diamonds 5/3|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|andyv:  sometimes we do see illusions when we are defending|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: He was just making sure, but really there was no possible alternative defense.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kit: Classic weak 2 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  W have enough for 3N?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mamos: he might think that he has but he hasnt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the @c suit will be the drawback|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|andyv:  if playing feature, this should keep them out of game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: I think 3@h showed good suit bad hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: on previous hand, declarer could have made via straight crossruff -- same contract and lead in other room, so we shall see if they can do better.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphznu: Livin looks at syscard opps now|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT might well make - eg on Spade lead |pg||
nt|kit: Somewhat of a guess here, but playing low will set up a spade trick for a diamond discard, forcing the opponents to get things very right if the hand can be defeated.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  that option not available now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|kit: Levin decided that looking at king of spades in dummy, more likely would underlead ace than queen|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  making 3|pg||
mc|9|nt|kit: Also, if North has both AQ of spades, then South probably has king of diamonds anyway since North passed hand|pg||
pg||

nt|athene: bocchi-madala play quite an active game so i would not be surprised if bocchi bids 5@C in that same position|pg||
nt|athene: a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|kemperg: seeing bears on the road|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 5@C bid would win 4 imps and maybe more if EW will bid to the 5 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||
nt|wild card: on fleisher's line of play, he would probably only have succeeded if spades were 3/2|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|vugraphznv: 2@s+5@ss+4@cs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 7-10hcp|pg||
nt|kemperg: should fear a ruff|pg||
nt|wild card: or 4/1 with the 4card with the 3 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in the Open Room they did start with a weak 2 using multi ... that may have made it a bit harder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S were 3/2, you mean @Hs.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 2@C is both majors by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: duboin giving his partner quite a bit of leeway for 2@C at favourable|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 2@H is a fine contract|pg||
nt|lml: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 2/3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: more than 13|pg||
nt|lml: on the finesses|pg||
nt|wild card: I mean if hearts were 3/2 and spades 4/1 he would have also gone down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: but his @DQJ are not going to be much use facing shortage|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: likely 11 tricks with nice lay of diamonds and spade split|pg||
nt|stoffers: Einarson with a huge hand after whats shown here, i would rather bid 3@s than 3@d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: with 33 HCP most pairs should reach a slam somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: maybe all|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: needing a club finesse you really dont want to be in the grand but ...|pg||
nt|ady: nice cheap trick to begin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yet to see a routine game hand:)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: so south knows they are off the @CQ from the keycard response|pg||
nt|udo: @D discard?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|stoffers: But, bad splits and game not making today- quite lucky for him|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: as expected, bocchi bid 5@C and reaped a large reward|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely ruff and would bank on @D finesse, whick is correct.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: from south 6@C is better |pg||
nt|lml: with the @SQ protected|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ron_sc2002: well done by bocchi|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: wd.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: if he plays a trump now, the roof comes in; south just draws trumps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ron_sc2002: and the defence made the same to beat 5@H|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
mc|9|nt|lml: as the cards lie of course nothing can hurt a grand|pg||
pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: They play 15-17, but are willing to upgrade a lot as seen here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 4, 4@h went down 1 in CR|pg||
nt|kit: yes, same line of play.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: Spade lead would have been effective, but I don't think there will be much chance for declarer anyway|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos: this needs something nice in Clubs but not quite here|pg||
nt|kit: This is cute falsecard -- it really can't cost.|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer has K10 doubleton, the clubs are running anyway.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|kit: Levin now knows clubs are 4-2 -- would never falsecard from Q109, since declarer might have Kxxx.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: Levin knows he needs ace of spades onside -- that gets him to 1 spade, 4 clubs, 2 hearts, 1 diamond, and hopefully another red-suit trick.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|d8|nt|kit: Levin expects North to lead back a heart -- that will set up a heart trick, and then all he needs is ace of spades onside.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: the diamond discard exposed Levin to a diamond shift, but he can see that North won't be able to find that from any holding.|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: that's true|pg||
nt|udo: north discarded all hie entries to @HJ|pg||
nt|kemperg: think they have free drinks anyhow :)|pg||

mb|1N!|an|14-16|nt|athene: well, north threw a trick, yes|pg||
nt|athene: he could have kept @DJ and the heart winner|pg||
nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
mb|2S!|an|inv or !cs|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: transfer to @C.|pg||
mb|2N!|an|min|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt = @h fit|pg||
nt|udo: looks like:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: invitational values|pg||
nt|udo: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explained from Versace to Masood|pg||
nt|ady: around 1NT  loooks likely|pg||
nt|wild card: what's the range of 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||
nt|famus: Hello Udo & William|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=12-14 EXCEPT  3rd seat vul = 15-17|pg||
nt|wild card: thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: more spades from west|pg||
nt|lml: a lot more it appears|pg||

nt|stoffers: Hi there Denmark :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sort of :-)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|ron_sc2002: Pass is clearly forcing in this situation|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N has bid 6@s|pg||
nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||
nt|star6ija: complicate decision for Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Aronov will open 1N and Stefanov will bid  so  nobody stopping in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- does DBL now show 2@D?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they play 14-16 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|star6ija: I expected this bid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|skaftij:  Only lived in Denmark last 31 years, being an Icelander|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
pc|hT|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so he does not have to take the @d decision|pg||
nt|lml: there may be a trump promotion on a diamond play now |pg||
nt|stoffers: Ah, nice|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: but still i think @DK shift is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if the @CQ got covered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe it will be 1N in the other room|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Should make comfortably|pg||
pc|s2|nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: they play upside down|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrrick as it has gone|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well for declarer |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|wild card: in the other room, west raised his partner to 3NT immediately|pg||
nt|wild card: a good bid in my opinion although we can see 3NT won't make on this board|pg||

nt|andyv:  so far 1 for 6 in making contracts|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kit: If North bids 4@H, will Levin "accept the transfer" and bid 4@S?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3H|nt|kit: I must admit I don't understand the reason for the 2NT call.  What will he find out?  I think he should just bid whatever number of hearts he thinks is right.|pg||
nt|kit: Now Levin gets to describe his hand at a lower level.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kit: And Weinstein will surely bid 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H makes, so 4@S is a decent save.  The question is whether or not it is a good save -- i.e. a save that makes.|pg||
nt|mamos: the Club bid is bad news for East though|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I guess Weinstein bid 4@H rather than 4@S to tell his partner he had some cards in case of further competition or slam possibility.|pg||
nt|kit: N-S bought it for 4@H in other room, so will be a big pickup for USA1 regardless of the fate of 4@S.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  any reason for 4@s not to make?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think declarer can quite survive the bad minor-suit splits here.|pg||
nt|mamos: not enough tricks?|pg||
nt|kit: very good reason -- what 10 tricks does declarer take?|pg||
nt|andyv:  good reason:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Kit is right, 4@hX made in CR|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: Having seen the queen of clubs falsecard on the earlier board, Levin will be suspcious of the king of diamonds.|pg||
nt|kit: Although South has shown hearts and clubs and a 4-1 trump split will be difficult to survive, so he will probably think it is a stiff king.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||

nt|kit: And now the worthless ruff and discard.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
mc|9|nt|mamos: if North had jumped directly to 4@h here  it would have made life more difficult for East - 4@h may be  a weak hand or may be a strong one |pg||

nt|vugraphznv: discussion in bulgarian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i do not understand.... :(|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
nt|wild card: by staying somewhat lower, south africa gained 3 IMPs, getting the lead in this match|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|rnmalik: 4@H a likely contract for NS and makeable as the cards are placed.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stoffers: If one of the pairs finds out they will ofcource correct the score|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||
nt|stoffers: Duboin knowing about a diamondlooser now (no 4@d)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
nt|ady: 1 trump out of the way|pg||
pc|s2|nt|stoffers: 6 (lucky) imps to Iceland on bd21, they take what they get against opponents like this|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|kemperg: he knows @CA with partner, so @DA on leader|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: on  6 the auction was 1N-all pass|pg||
nt|star6ija: Karaivanov would be surprized realizing that Trendafilov still is not shorter in trumps than him|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: or a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice play|pg||
nt|udo: i think he should find the duck,,,he knows @D are running most of the time|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: and if declarer has the @DA, it is clear that playing ace and another trump just releases control and allows the diamonds to run|pg||
nt|ady: club ruff coming soon|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|athene: this is very often a problem for the defence - whether to draw trumps or not|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer is trying for a ruff but has a threatening side-suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: and underleading or ducking the ace of trumps is often the key|pg||

nt|athene: japan might get their first imp there, if East in the other room leads his ace against six|pg||
nt|athene: (i am sure bocchi madala will reach six)|pg||
nt|lml: well Baxter's choice of 2@S turned out to be a good choice although perhaps south would still have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: so Canada has the lead again|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|athene: if they can take the club finesse and make 11 in 3nt|pg||
nt|stoffers: A lot of dull boards this set|pg||
mb|d!|nt|kemperg: Have to leave now, bye all|pg||
nt|athene: make 10 sry|pg||
nt|famus: wud b good for morale:)|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|lml: I am not sure about that last result ... looked like 2 down not 1 down|pg||
nt|star6ija: I do not expect they to go further than 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: i asked them and the claim was for 1 down, 1 also though like 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I asked them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=ART FG  a) @C  b) 4@H  c) long @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he actually has 2 of the 3 options covered|pg||
nt|stoffers: We want action and blood :)|pg||
nt|wild card: not the first time we see a transfer on one level today|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: i played against Lauria-Versace 3 or 4 times,,,when they are on a run,, u feel pressure every second|pg||
nt|athene: slam is not so bad here, if played by north to protect the @CK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D asks|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 and a half :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 3NT  best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: but south has the diamonds so it would have to be 6nt (or 6@S, but that is not likely)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H    totally new concept|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|famus: 6NT wud be great|pg||
nt|athene: north may now offer 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: but it's tricky|pg||
nt|athene: good hand but no aces|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|udo: nice bid by South,,now North shoudl accept,,, he has a clear max|pg||
nt|wild card: interesting question is, what would redouble instead of 1@s mean|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I believe 1@s did show a 3crd|pg||
nt|wild card: and does dbl on 1@h show a takeout hand (like this), or something in hearts|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|athene: well, this might make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now the lead // who would lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: lauria did not double 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: but the italians don't double these bids very often|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might still lead a club|pg||
nt|famus: i bet a @c lead|pg||
nt|udo: @C looks like he natural lead........maybe a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's close between club and spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is not "that great"|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|udo: 13 now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|famus: might lose an imp or two here--coz the Ita wud b in 6NT if at all|pg||
nt|ady: this will likely make in spite of bad split|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: defence just has trump tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: well, if bocchi-madala play 6nt from north side, Pakistan can feel it is just not their day|pg||
nt|stoffers: Got to go, thx all and see you :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  True Viking attitude :-)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|athene: can cash @SAK and play three rounds of trumps now to force east to give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw the club loser from dummy and ruff in hand but then dummy has only one trump to deal with two club losers|pg||
nt|athene: so one down|pg||
nt|athene: west didn't want to shift to the @CQ because declarer could have stiff king (four clubs with east for the double)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry five|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|skaftij:  Thx Christer|pg||

nt|udo: sy, still 12|pg||
mc|7|nt|lml: surprising result in the OR|pg||
nt|athene: he probably just asked if the @HQ falls|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a lot of italian words being said|pg||

nt|ady: bidding to poor games can be costly|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This might get interesting|pg||
nt|wild card: South Africa is back on lead, in the closed room west went for 800 on board 9|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: so Canada takes a big 10 imp lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at these colors  1N=11-14|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: surely East runs|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: west didnt bother with stayman with a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
nt|lml: all quacky too|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w now of the hook|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: true...west breathing easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: would you bid 2@s or 2@h now?|pg||
nt|wild card: we can see 2@h is a much better contract|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphznv: he looks more relaxed now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S looks appropriate however could bid 2@H, matter of judgment.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: 3@D promising 4-card major(s) but not 5|pg||
nt|ady: the 2@C rescue might also have been painful on good defence|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|famus: good for u Jan--coz all those must b which u wudn't want ur young son to hear!!!:)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace often have quite intense "discussions" when they get a less than perfect board :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  9 quick tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphznv: they like to play with 6 trumps i think|pg||
pc|c6|nt|udo: this lead helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  that 1N was 9-12|pg||
nt|star6ija: they reached the worst possible contract...even 3N has greater chances|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|wild card: well, you already have told you're low on points, and you'll never make your hearts in a spade contract|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: some play re-double in east seat compels 2@C  which east would pass with what he had  or if a higher suit would then bid his suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have 3 ranges for 1N   at fav  1/2=9-12  3/4=11-14  otherwise 15-17|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|udo: still,,,9 tricks ,,hmm,,,,may need some endplay|pg||
nt|athene: will he try finessing the @S9 for a dummy entry?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|udo: i see only 7 tricks actually|pg||
nt|famus: that 1 imp is becoming more illusive with each passing board--sounds like poetry!!:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: @SK there was safe, wasn't it? i guess not if east had @SQ109xx, but is that really possible?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|ehsana: hello all :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: so probably 4|pg||
nt|lml: and likely a push or an imp in it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphznv: a spade to the @s J|pg||
nt|athene: lauria decides to give up on the heart finesse since it might be wrong anyway and even if right, very hard to get to take it twice|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EA--can u tell us who was their coach--i forget the name??|pg||
nt|athene: even if the @S10 is onside|pg||
nt|ehsana: Kokish's  reps in Karachi|pg||
nt|famus: ah ok--ther are people looking here for those reps:))haha--joking|pg||
nt|athene: if the hearts are breaking, then it is advantageous to cash them|pg||
nt|star6ija: how he will go probably wrong|pg||
nt|ady: can make   ruff high and draw   and play on either red suit  |pg||
nt|star6ija: I think chances are greater for ruffing with the 8 here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fingers on the ten...not on the table|pg||
nt|ady: have to guess|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: to take some exit cards away from the defence and make them discard|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|famus: with two entries it wud've fetched him more to return @hs--but Lauria does it for him|pg||
nt|ehsana: hink Lauria is giving all up|pg||
nt|athene: but if they aren't breaking, cashing them just sets up a trick or tricks for a defender|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finesse @ss now|pg||
nt|udo: @S to 9 and still interesting|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: guessed right    though perhaps a little luck;y|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, but ... if W has 4 trumps with 9 promotion is already done|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|famus: @H back|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: on  11  Levin east overcalled artificial 1@C with 1@S|pg||
nt|ady: playing on hearts for 9th trick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|famus: so 7 it is|pg||
nt|athene: easy for masood now; he knows his pd has the @DA entry to hearts|pg||
nt|udo: soith ahs a @D exit now, for north to cash the @H s|pg||
nt|udo: south|pg||
nt|ehsana: loks 4 away|pg||
nt|udo: 2 down,,whatever he does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will be hard to duplicate Martel's 4@S making|pg||
pc|c9|nt|famus: -2|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|nt|athene: lauria just hoping south has the @DA of course|pg||
nt|famus: :)|pg||
nt|ady: dont split|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: but diamonds coming in now|pg||
nt|star6ija: well played|pg||
pc|h5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: ecept no entry|pg||
pc|d9|nt|udo: his only chance,,|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: that would mean north doesn't get the hearts AND south gets endplayed|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|d|mb|3S|nt|kit: This is the most awkward of the 4th suit sequences, since often one must complete the description at a high level.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|kit: I guess they always raise on 3, so Bosenbeerg can bid 3@S with a doubleton honor.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: this all worked out well though|pg||
nt|kit: Not clear where declarer is going to find 10 tricks here, although it did make in other room.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 rounds of @ds will cause some headache for declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: actually 3 rounds of diamonds happened at other table, and that let contract make!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  if he ruffs high, will he finesse the J@s?|pg||
nt|kit: I think best defense may be a trump shift, though far from obvious.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  even if S pitches on 3rd @d, he may still have to finesse in @h suit for 10th trick|pg||
nt|kit: which he will -- that's what happened in other room.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  Walter Johnson points out that the squeeze would work|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  but now must take finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt is a possible call with that south hand|pg||

nt|ehsana: $S on fro N/S|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S|pg||
nt|ritong: so far so good|pg||
nt|skaftij:  rathe heavy 3@s|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: NS play multi - maybe he thinks that hand is too strong for weak-two but too weak for 1@S|pg||
nt|wild card: board 10, EW in the open room also bid 4@h, got a diamond lead, declarer misguessed trumps but still got home after a wrong defence|pg||
mb|3H!|an|inv+ in !ss|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wild card: south apparently wants to know whether to play 3NT or 4@s, and that's an easy decision for north|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: Natural 4@S but appears difficult to make on J@D lead.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: think this will end in game|pg||
nt|ady: not slam|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|wild card: 3@h conventional, I've seen Americans do that before|pg||
nt|wild card: with both @dA and @cK offside, he will go down|pg||
nt|wild card: and 3NT might be made|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|c7|nt|vugraphznv: it did|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: he is trying for the crossruff but it wont work for him|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: west might have pushed with 5@C   and taken a view if east cu 5@D|pg||
nt|wild card: he can discard 3 clubs now|pg||
nt|wild card: but after @d10, I doubt he will depend on the heart finesse|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: premature Q@C|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|wild card: probably he will have to|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: as if @C ever get any respect  now they're premature|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is that the long hand is overrufing the spades|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lml: the cards lie very well for north-south|pg||
nt|ehsana: DBL was nota good option ??|pg||

mb|5H|nt|athene: will west offer notrumps, or just bash in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he surely must bid SOME game, with a good 17 count facing drury|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: why not?|pg||
nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||

mb|p|nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||

nt|wild card: probably he wasn't considering anything else than 6@s, but east had some questions about the auction or kept the tray for a couple of seconds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No play, can cash a @C otherwise make 7.|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||

nt|vugraphznu: yes..|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  NS bid to 5@d in CR, hence the 5@s contract|pg||

nt|andyv:  now will auction die if S bids 5@d?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mamos: the dbl should stop him bidding 5@d perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, if he bid 3N expecting to run @ds, then he should bid 5@d here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  but you were right mike|pg||

nt|mamos: once N has doubled 4@S  I think South can only bid 5@d if he is pretty sure it will make - hence I think he has to Pass here albeit reluctantly|pg||

nt|lml: and 9 tricks in a normal 1NT contract|pg||
nt|ritong: would you downgrade west?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that 11th trick on board 30 might be the "1 imp" board for Pakistan|pg||
nt|famus: ah--went thru some transfer sequences--great|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ritong: i don t think versace will|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wild card: north's hand looks like 3NT|pg||
mb|3S!|an|transfer to 3NT|nt|wild card: the heart stopper and the high card point count are not sufficient though|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: why not 1N from Karaivanov???   i thought 9-12 in this situation|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand 4@S and 5@D.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lml: both teams are playing good bridge with Canada making a few good decisions |pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: no,,,,,,,1NT is a preempt,,so never downgrade:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: 5@d needs attentive declarer play|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ritong: opening 1NT has other virtues than showing 15/17|pg||
nt|ady: too high e/w|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 10 tricks claimed very shortly |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  good sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: do you like bypassing diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: it did work to get them a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lead is asked @d 6|pg||
nt|athene: it's definitely not a bad 15 count|pg||
nt|wild card: I guess he'll lead Q of @c|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wild card: plenty of time to shift to a heart later on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q alright but @D:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: north pened a tactical lead direct 1 spade in 3rd seat to get the right lead if defending|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: ducked it ... cool|pg||
nt|ehsana: 2H shows 4spades|pg||
nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|udo: style is to upgrade much more often than the other way|pg||
nt|athene: three aces and the @H10 makes up for 4333|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: I like the small club|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if it gets north|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: perfect play the small @c|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|lml: had north wanted south on lead for something he may have ducked|pg||
nt|lml: looks like north will get a spade and a club for +1|pg||
nt|lml: for Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: Israel made an extra uptrick on the previous board to come back to a 9 imp deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: +1 it seems to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but N is thinking a lot|pg||
nt|lml: my guess is he will shift to a heart|pg||
nt|lml: it wont matter|pg||
nt|lml: second choice is another diamond|pg||
nt|lml: who thinks a heart?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|ahollan1: would like to see auction after  P-1N[9-12]|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|athene: right about now, in fact|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30, Lauria in 3NT in OR|pg||
pc|c4|nt|udo: @S 3-2,, @H finesse,,all is fine|pg||
nt|udo: no @C ruff|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|wild card: now the heart ruff is lost|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
nt|athene: south has a pretty nice 12; he might just invite|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|athene: of course if west doubles a 2@H transfer that might alter things|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next session will be at 16.45 hours..|pg||
nt|athene: but they play 2-way stayman over the mini notrump|pg||
nt|athene: and no transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N back |pg||

nt|ady: final hand of the session    thx all    thx specs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Einarsson decided quickly not to finesses @h, queen being more likely with South and ruff pending|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: final board of match at our table    3rd/final session of the day scheduled to begin in about 1 hour|pg||
mb|1H|nt|skaftij:  This is the last match today|pg||
mb|d!|an|4+!ss|nt|athene: now south has the choice of 2@S, weak takeout|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@C "weak stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL = 4 or 5 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H for e/w looks the spot|pg||
mb|2H|nt|skaftij:  Thank you all kibs for good comments, I was not able to bring all forwards |pg||
mb|p|an| |nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
nt|skaftij:  thanks to our magnificent operator|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bob|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match. Thanks to our operator Natalia and specs for watching some absorbing bridge.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly    nust know I would like a cup of tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 1@C includes weak NT as well as some strong hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx all for watching|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: thx Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks, last board for the day here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@c must show @d and @s|pg||
nt|wild card: Last board of this match. Next round will start at 13:45 local time (in somewhat more than an hour)|pg||
nt|wild card: is that correct Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Think so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why East bid 4@H instead of 1@D transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tough to find the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
nt|ady: because I want my cup of tea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol ...for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming weat holds weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weat???   that was supposed to be weSt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  Levin in 6@S East|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that will be worth some imps to usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that after Stefanov opened 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south stil thinking ...do not go away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room  "Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicker. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S""|pg||
nt|ady: play of 6@S easier after £@C opening|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|vugraphznv: 4@C fit for at least 1 with good hand |pg||

nt|harmon: .|pg||
pc|d3|nt|harmon: Baxter has clear 3h bid competition in spades|pg||
nt|harmon: 3s is forcing|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: versace plays the @DQ to make it look as though he has nothing in diamonds in hand|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
nt|udo: but with @c 3-3 , no need to find @S queen|pg||
nt|ritong: with 5@h presumably, 4@ds and 3 @cs if he tests the suit, what he certainly will do|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after he cashes the clubs, the spade guess won't present a problem|pg||
