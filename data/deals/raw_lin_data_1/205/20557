mb|1D|nt|gluckenval: gli amici/avversari giocano un sistema abbastanza naturale, con l'apertura 1NT differenziata tra zona (15-17)  prima (12-14), e la vecchia 2@D multi, come particolarità|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: and declarer accepts 11 tricks // I dont think he should have|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lml: 1@H was a bid of convenience for West|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lml: especially because he has a nice way to get out in 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: south might have bid double |pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: hello|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: but I suppose the vulnerability was a disincentive|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: does 1@h show a 4 card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes, was the answer, normally|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|athene: east's double obviously says "i want to bid 3@H, but i am doubling just in case you happen to have a big club stack,  so you can pass"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi William...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Ron|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: he couldnt support diamonds at the two-level with a weak bid|pg||
nt|lml: north=south have a heart ruff here|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT was balanced showing less than a strong notrump|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that's why it was asked, also if spade suit could be there|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|athene: 3@C would have been easy enough on a heart lead|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 3@H should go down but no so bad as 3@C will make|pg||

mb|5H|nt|lml: David Lindop is thinking how many spades|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H is not making but in this vul it is hard for N to let it go|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 6 @c .....|pg||
nt|lml: West will likely open a weak 2 in spades|pg||
nt|udo: good morning|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: i would open 2@C with east's hand for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: then south might try 3@C maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Udo and wlc :)|pg||
nt|udo: i am at work, but will try to comment sometimes|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ron_sc2002: E hand is 3 loosers|pg||
nt|lml: he decided his spades were too weak for that|pg||
nt|udo: 3@D = inverted,,weak raise with good support,,quite common agreement nowadays|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||
nt|lml: a matter of style|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: i would have overcalled 1@H with the north hand but pass is ok if your partner is there for you with a double|pg||
nt|kemperg: the only lossing line?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|lml: wow ... well done north south|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ron_sc2002: agree.. partner probably wont bid again so better to make pressure on E and bid directly 5@C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: would all of you have got to 6@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tricky too bid|pg||

nt|athene: bocchi-madala play quite an active game so i would not be surprised if bocchi bids 5@C in that same position|pg||
nt|athene: a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|kemperg: seeing bears on the road|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 5@C bid would win 4 imps and maybe more if EW will bid to the 5 level|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: in the Open Room they did start with a weak 2 using multi ... that may have made it a bit harder|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 2@C is both majors by E|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: duboin giving his partner quite a bit of leeway for 2@C at favourable|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 2@H is a fine contract|pg||
nt|lml: lots of tricks here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: more than 13|pg||
nt|lml: on the finesses|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: but his @DQJ are not going to be much use facing shortage|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lml: with 33 HCP most pairs should reach a slam somewhere|pg||

pc|h8|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|athene: as expected, bocchi bid 5@C and reaped a large reward|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ron_sc2002: well done by bocchi|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: if he plays a trump now, the roof comes in; south just draws trumps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ron_sc2002: and the defence made the same to beat 5@H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sQ|nt|lml: as the cards lie of course nothing can hurt a grand|pg||

nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
mb|4S|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||

nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: or a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice play|pg||
nt|udo: i think he should find the duck,,,he knows @D are running most of the time|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: and if declarer has the @DA, it is clear that playing ace and another trump just releases control and allows the diamonds to run|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d5|nt|athene: this is very often a problem for the defence - whether to draw trumps or not|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer is trying for a ruff but has a threatening side-suit as well|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: a normal 3nt|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: do you like bypassing diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: it did work to get them a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lead is asked @d 6|pg||
nt|athene: it's definitely not a bad 15 count|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: ducked it ... cool|pg||
nt|ehsana: 2H shows 4spades|pg||
nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|udo: style is to upgrade much more often than the other way|pg||
nt|athene: three aces and the @H10 makes up for 4333|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: I like the small club|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if it gets north|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: perfect play the small @c|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: had north wanted south on lead for something he may have ducked|pg||
nt|lml: looks like north will get a spade and a club for +1|pg||
nt|lml: for Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: Israel made an extra uptrick on the previous board to come back to a 9 imp deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: +1 it seems to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but N is thinking a lot|pg||
nt|lml: my guess is he will shift to a heart|pg||
nt|lml: it wont matter|pg||
nt|lml: second choice is another diamond|pg||
nt|lml: who thinks a heart?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphznv: i do :-)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|athene: right about now, in fact|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|udo: @S 3-2,, @H finesse,,all is fine|pg||
nt|udo: no @C ruff|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is not good|pg||
nt|lml: that club play is a problem|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
nt|athene: south has a pretty nice 12; he might just invite|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|athene: of course if west doubles a 2@H transfer that might alter things|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next session will be at 16.45 hours..|pg||
nt|athene: but they play 2-way stayman over the mini notrump|pg||
nt|athene: and no transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N back |pg||
nt|lml: no big deal when you have nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last board now // Hope you all enjoyed|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d!|nt|athene: now south has the choice of 2@S, weak takeout|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@C "weak stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL = 4 or 5 @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: how do you allocate it?|pg||
nt|lml: we have "both|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|ritong: the light overcall drives to the wrong lead, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: and Lindop|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: and Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: votes each way|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lml: yes the 2NT bid was a killer|pg||
nt|lml: I think west is more to blame myself|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they would have played the double of 2NT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|lml: if you play 3@S is not forcing maybe you could but that is hard|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|harmon: .|pg||
pc|hT|nt|harmon: Baxter has clear 3h bid competition in spades|pg||
nt|harmon: 3s is forcing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: versace plays the @DQ to make it look as though he has nothing in diamonds in hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: still, Bocchi-Madala should wander into this game without much trouble|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s5|pc|d8|nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thanks all see you back in 1 1 /2 hour ca.|pg||
nt|ritong: now he can determine that north has singleton @s|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|udo: but with @c 3-3 , no need to find @S queen|pg||
nt|ritong: with 5@h presumably, 4@ds and 3 @cs if he tests the suit, what he certainly will do|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after he cashes the clubs, the spade guess won't present a problem|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: but right, the @c break makes this academic|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not risk it, just for an overtrick|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: oh sorry he doesn't need it anyway|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|udo: so,,this was very good italian session again,|pg||
