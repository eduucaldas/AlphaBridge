nt|vugraphznt: Hi all and welcome to this match from Veldhoven. Iceland vs. China|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Play will start in a minute -- Einarsson and Jorgensen are discussing their defense|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: against the chinese system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|barnets:  morning all from florida|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy v USA in the Bermuda Bowl has a good ring to it. These events are enhanced by the decades of history behind them.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am watching the live video stream, but it is from the other table at the moment.|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Utaly picked up three big wins on the first day, but they had some harder fights yesterday.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphznt: There we go|pg||
nt|ady: still leading?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphznt: welcome everybody|pg||
nt|gracelin: H all|pg||
nt|brolucius: China beat them by 1 IMP in a great match. (There was a very rare vice squeeze on the last board - worth looking up in the VG records).|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: part score in diamonds  looks best|pg||
nt|brolucius: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|brolucius: .. for the live video pictures|pg||
nt|ady: could Bocchi get over ambitious in hearts|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Bocchi's 1@C is natural. All 3 Italian pairs play 2-over 1, which means that a two-level response to one of a suit is game-forcing.|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|gracelin: Lian and Dhi is the natural pair in the Chinese team.  Bocchi also play natural with variable 1NT range|pg||
nt|gracelin: we sstart the match with a slam hand.  6S is cold and 7S on the D finesse which works.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy is now lying first comfortably with an average of 24 VP in the first 4 round.  China lies 13th at moment.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2 c is 54 11-15, qualsiasi rever senza 3|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D via a negative double is weaker than a direct 2@D on the previous round.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: there is a double dummy defense to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: west considering   will likely raise in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 2d must be a relay and 2H probably shows 5D/4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: witam na meczu Polska-Bu³garia|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wooldridge bid 1NT (transfer to 2@C) intending to support spades on the next round. That is why transfers are so effective in many situations. They give you two bites at the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: cherry.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wooldridge explaining he is not 100% sure if 1nt shows clubs or could be a raise in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sometimes they differ , depends on 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but hurd explained as @C ,  madala just wants to know the insides|pg||
nt|ady: would double of 3@S be penalty from North  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ins & outs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: madala asking for the director|pg||
nt|brolucius: When 1@C is basically natural but maybe two or three cards, it is usually best for the defenders to treat it as natural in their subsequent bidding.|pg||
nt|barnets: it seems norths double relates to wests 1n bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  1N=transfer to @C's, but since N opened 1@C, this showed a strong 3-card raise.  Hurd's immediate 2@S over the X showed a minimum|pg||
nt|ady: not sure  what south is meant to do?|pg||
nt|barnets: if wests bid showed clubs perhaps norths x also showed clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: That agreement prevents any misunderstandings, such as may have arisen here.|pg||
nt|barnets: hence x of 3@S would also be penalty|pg||
nt|barnets: by north|pg||
nt|ady: that would seem to be a reasonable choice|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not immediately obvious why N/S should call the director. They are probably happy to be defending 3@S.|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 rounds of spades would seem to defeat 3@SX even with 3 club tricks for declarer|pg||
mb|4D|nt|fluffy: the important factor here for south, is that perhaps on some meanings of 1NT he is on forcing now, and on others he isnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT was slightly ambitious.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had an obvious raise with that splendid heart suit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: to powa¿ny przeciwnik, który siê powa¿nie liczy w walce o awans do ósemki |pg||
nt|ady: not even necessary to do that       east unable to ruff any diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: actually they do not have a misunderstanding, wooldridge just giving all the info he can|pg||
nt|ady: this looks down 1 on the baad diamond split|pg||
nt|ady: will Bocchi try 4@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: even before madala asked anything about 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: A messy start to the match.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|gracelin: the later round of bidding is not explained in their CC so we will have to take some guess.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6S is more comfortable a contract than 6D.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lets see if they find the "killing defence" here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: since they are in GF tempo, mabe south will rebid is spade suit and get a raise on the way to 6S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense is easier now east has bid diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they didnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: antykontra Mihova mo¿e spowodowaæ wist  treflowy |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: is it a winner now?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: if S ducks one @h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and I guess thats not DD :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes that may work also|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|brolucius: East tries to slip through a 9th trick in diamonds. |pg||
nt|brolucius: By leading the jack, pretending to finesse against the Q, he aims to catch South asleep. Not today!|pg||
nt|desinka: hello all|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps NS weren't prepared to defend against this 1NT convention|pg||
nt|fluffy: looks like Bocchi though that double of 1NT asked partner not to make any forward moves, but south didn't understand it that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to understand that 5@D. His partner did not have enough to bid 2@D on the first round.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: so the 4NT might be Turbo, showing odd numbers of key-card, in the meantime cue in H.|pg||
nt|lechcold: Grzegorz hamowa³ jak móg³, ale Krzysztof mia³ za du¿¹ kartê....|pg||
nt|ady: a lot of bidding on this hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: 6D will go down if it's East hold that K10xx in trumps.  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: but if east has one heart and two clubs you have to win first heart|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphznt: and now focus is on Einarsson|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Our valiant operator is trying to recover from the crash (which of course was not his fault at all).|pg||
mc|9|nt|mathat: Q @c lead 3 r  @h|pg||

nt|ady: USA playing 3NT with n/s cards  OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: A pretty awful board for Italy, whatever was the cause of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to relog because open room was down|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|brolucius: No percentage in North entering the bidding.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ... and North has then protected with a take-out double.|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: 4@h = @ss|pg||
nt|ady: 1@S?|pg||
mb|2N|an|4!H|nt|brolucius: 1@S denies spades. With 4 or 5 spades he would double.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gracelin: trying to see how he could make the slam :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: EW play standard short club, 5-card majors, strong notrump|pg||
nt|gracelin: West will bud to 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many use a cue-bid to show a sound 3-card raise, 2NT shows a 4-card raise.|pg||
nt|barnets: NS in danger now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East has bid 2@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5H will be very expensive at this Vul.|pg||

nt|rensph:  seems we're back and good to go. :) Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: but often the opponents will not believe they are given a gift|pg||

nt|psyck:  (you can mute the audio to hear voice commentary here)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few would bid 1@H, vul against not, on those South cards. |pg||
nt|ady: will try club switch|pg||
nt|ady: 9 or queen?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|brolucius: When the opponents find a fit and then stop at the two level, the other side know that the points are divided and that they will likely have a fit somewhere.|pg||
nt|ady: and then again at 3 level|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|gracelin: declarer needs to guess trump to make this, but I am afraid he will not.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably down one but can in fact pick up the spades|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mathat: @c is 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: So South survived a potential second disaster as a diamond lead would have produced 1100 should west have chanced a x of 3@H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|gracelin: from the 5H bid and the double, it's likely that north has a singleton trump|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: how can he believe north bids 5H at unfav Vul. with this 5422 hand.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer finesses in spades, seeking a discard for one of his diamond losers.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|kit: The location of the king of spades means that South does well in 3@C, but the same location means that E-W won't make 3@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after all, north only bid 2H in first round.  So maybe declarer will figure it out.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will have to finish this and re start to link with other table so after this hand ill close this|pg||
nt|gracelin: got it|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: moment of truth. he would love to finesse the SJ but entry is not cnvenient|pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the first time Lian plays for China.  His partner Shi is a veteran and reach semi-final in the 2009 BB|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rhelle:  NS had a relay sequence, where North asked South questions about his distribution and strength|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2N|nt|fluffy: 2NT = 3@S + 6@d|pg||

nt|nemeo: all'altro tavolo sono arrivati a 5@h su cui Woolridge è un po' che pensa|pg||

nt|barnets: a low diamond lead V 6@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: North may respond 4@S  to his partner's one-bid. No, he has preferred 1@S.|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: had to claim the first 2 |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is two down, assuming the defence attack clubs early enough|pg||
nt|barnets: works quite well|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rhelle:  And now West has a problem. 2@s is non forcing, but he has a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: but nanev, with singleton spade facing a takeout double, might bid on|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX in other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|rhelle:  He doesn't know about the wasted @h values in his partner's hand, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of auction some play 2NT by the opener as weak-strong. That allows them to show a strong 3@C rebid (by bidding 3@C) or a shapely weaker one (via 2NT).|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: fearing his opponents have a huge fit and more shape than they do have|pg||

pc|d5|nt|athene: when he bids 4nt you might think it is offering two places to play, in which case he should pass 5@C|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: N/S are not playing a strong 1@C system. That is probably why North did not want to make a pre-emptive 4@S response - in case his partner was strong and they could make a slam.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W has no quick entry to allow a @s thru.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the problem for East is communication. He can throw @cs on @h KQ, but how to get there?|pg||
nt|brolucius: When dummy has only one card in the suit led, the partner of the opening leader can give a suit preference card to suggest a switch.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@h = 4@h, 5+@d|pg||

nt|gracelin: good convention.|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a diamond guess to make 4@H|pg||

nt|kit: And in fact, N-S have profitable save in 5@C, and pushing opponents to 5@H (which likely would have happened) is a big bonus|pg||
nt|athene: slam might be harder to reach if west opened 2@S - what do you do with that north hand? just punt 3nt?|pg||

nt|rhelle:  4@d = 2 controls; an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he ask for it?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, and he will|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@h = relay, asking for high cards|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|rhelle:  5@c = @dK, @hK, nothing in @c|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@d = asking for more high cards|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@s = DQ, not @hQ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  On the last board at the other table Verhees van Prooyen were in the better 3nt contract, which on the layout is cold..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so a good start for teh home team.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so really, NS are unlucky that South's red Q is in @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  otherwise they'd bid 7@d|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would have been better to raise clubs right away|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: may cash club and try diamond to the 10|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: entries mean he is likely to make it on the lucky heart diivision|pg||
pc|s2|nt|boedhy:  still think a lot of pairs will end up in 7 @d tho and i dont see a way to make it|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@h I don't understand - that is a sign-off|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in my version - clearly they play this differently|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I guess that they could sign off in 5@d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  taht should be possible...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 5@h is the relay, and 5NT shows the @dQ and denies the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: that will bring 8 tricks  unless 6 card spade suit out|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  yes probably has a specific meaning..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  showing the desire to compete|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and now he has done his part and passes|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|ady: might make only 9 if spade is ducked early by defence|pg||
nt|ady: when hearts split well will have 9 tricks and be relucant ti risk diamond finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rhelle:  NS need to cash their 3 tricks in a hurry|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but looking at the hands....|pg||
nt|daman:  my oleasure     a great interview|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d = more @ds than @cs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem here was the wide range 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: needs to win in east hand to make 12|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see that but he is trying to guarantee just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: on this lead|pg||
nt|barnets: there is no absolute guarantee I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: take the A , play @D and then take safety play perhaps for 9|pg||
nt|barnets: when he loses the lead the def shift to a spade|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lechcold: akurat w przypadku otwarcie 1@D nazwa "Precision" nie jest zbyt trafna:)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|boedhy:  5! is cold|pg||
nt|kit: Good judgment by all to reach par here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: West does not want to play a second top spade here.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|boedhy:  @s|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the @s8 will be lavinthal for @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  South can see he needs 2 @d tricks to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he needs the @dK in North|pg||
nt|rhelle:  might as well play the @dJ now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: They show standard count on king lead 5-level or higher contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will have given count.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and make 10|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|barnets: now he has the guarantee for his contract|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kit: Now, when West shifts to a heart East will have to deduce that reason West didn't cash second spade is that it isn't cashing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: bound to lose the @D for safety|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: 3C is also making here, so either 9 or 10 tricks will result in a tied board|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lechcold: 1@D to 11-15 punktów bez starszej pi¹tki i uk³adów pasuj¹cych do otwarcia 2@C|pg||
nt|kamyk: no i to w³anie jest precyzyjne opisanie charakteru rêki:)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has advertised length in the majors, so declarer will probably play West for the @DQ.|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say north had K10xx in diaimonds and hearts were 4-2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|boedhy:  difficult to see who must bid again|pg||
nt|kit: will just have easy squeeze -- will not need to finesse|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|kit: Note Levin's heart plays -- trying to hide king of hearts so declarer places him with other high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer just needs one of SA/HK to be on side.  In fact both are.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|boedhy:  but think  South has a sort of lesser rick decision|pg||
nt|boedhy:  risk|pg||
nt|kit: I doubt if declarer will be fooled here, but still good defensive technique|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: he would be down|pg||

nt|santyclz: Other Table, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|boedhy:  and then finding out he makes the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  think this last one will loose|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h is supposedly 10-12, multi for weaker hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@h = 6@hs 10-12 hcp|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kit: Weinstein evaluates his hand too strong for 1NT opening due to good 5-card club suit and 2 aces.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H call shows 5 spades, 4 hearts, invite values if I remember|pg||
nt|brolucius: The US South did enter on the @CK-Q-J-x-x-x hand and they then pushed E/W to 5@S for a 13-IMP swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lost connection, up to speed now|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 4H with the right guess of S, but they lack the points to go that high|pg||
mb|1S|nt|boedhy:  against 5@s doubled|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: so you were right Martin :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this has stolen the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  Normall NS play 1NT as a good 12-15|pg||

mb|1N|nt|gracelin: Hi Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  with all the good tens and the @h king onsite he will make 9 tricks...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to our excellent VG operator for the bidding explanations. Roland told us that the operators have been practising for a while and they have certainly been very good.|pg||
nt|kit: Routine 4@S contract, will easily make 10 or 11 tricks, and almost sure to be same at other table.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so you are cheating|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|brolucius: I am still getting kibitzers querying that it was right to enter with 3@C over 2@C on that South hand. Everyone knows that they should interfere over a strong 1@C, but it is just ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: as effective over 2@C, when the opponents are almost certain to have a game and will want to show their long suit rather than double you.|pg||

nt|athene: so he has to have four hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also west was more or less marked with spade ace since opponents points had to be divided|pg||

nt|barnets: in open room wst in 5@H on @D8 lead|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Good point. Some play that an immediate double shows values, some that it denies them.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: now it is looking more likely he is short in spades - with 2-4-2-5 he might open 1nt?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  ah, a good hand for EW|pg||
nt|ady: overcalls gettin lighter and lighter|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@S shows five and is 11-21 points. |pg||
mb|d|nt|boedhy:  yes no alert on 2@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT is not marked as forcing on their convention card.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy had an average of 24 VPs in the last 4 matches but they meet resistence here, at least until now.|pg||
nt|pelu: in Or N open and they are on rute to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  most pairs play some sort of relay in this situation|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think pass is wrong if west is not limited|pg||
nt|rhelle:  I guess it depends on the EW system|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: GF relay|pg||
mb|3H|nt|boedhy:  5@c is very good |pg||
nt|boedhy:  difficult to see for Muller... now they will bid it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  probably|pg||
nt|boedhy:  does anyone know where we can find the runnning scores?|pg||
nt|kit: whether forcing, seme-forcing, or NF not much choice|pg||
nt|kit: But the 2@S preference is very questionable|pg||
nt|gracelin: with the fitting cards in H, north will bid agressvely|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Bauke not amused....|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Muller that is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3 possible slams on this board, although 6@C is probably down on diamond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: dec rose K so is down in 5@H|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz: Anyone for a 3@h bid  by s on the 2nd round?|pg||
nt|kit: How can North possibly take another call?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W stopped in 2@H making, for China, on the board where we saw South make a pre-emptive raise to 3@C. 5 IMPs.|pg||
nt|athene: of course if he has a singleton spade you are down too :) but if he has doubleton, what are the odds it is Qx?|pg||
nt|kareno: He is the opening bidder which changes things somewhat.|pg||
nt|kareno: And no @h k|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure, it was close call|pg||
nt|athene: the @H10 here makes 6@H better|pg||
nt|athene: i mean better than it might have been :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he doesn't like his CK after the double|pg||
nt|pelu: but the D of 2@C sh slow N down|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: ta kontra, to typowa akcja Narkiewicza - nie ma ziewania|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: South could have a doubleton spade and a 6-count it would seem.  Unless these bids don't mean what they look like.|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@h is practically laydown while 6@s relies on 3-2 spades pretty well.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, indeed.  A good stop, probably enough for them to ake the lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: take|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think li should have mentioned his hearts before raising clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  And apteker will get the @c right|pg||
nt|lechcold: wa¿ne, ¿e walet trefl jest tam gdzie byæ powinien:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Li is really taking his time here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: looks like 4@S down 1 or 2 = 5-6 IMP for Italy|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: new zealand is the surprise of the tournament so far, they are leading usa2 by 35-10|pg||
nt|barnets: west played north for @DA as he is quite capable of having|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: if south knows his partner's shape then 6@H looks clear, with the good suit texture, even not knowing of the @H10 opposite|pg||
nt|kareno: Still it is hard to posit such a perfect fit.|pg||
nt|athene: a pity - my guess is south found out distribution but didn't know he was facing so many prime cards|pg||
nt|kareno: I would guess Italy will find the slam in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: and he didn't have any way to make a mild slam try in hearts - if he had done so, north would surely have accepted|pg||
nt|barnets: a good pickup here for USA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|boedhy:   http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for the runnning scores click on live scores bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still think much more system default or bidding mistake from Gower that they were not bidding it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  But Muller wil be thinking about this...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  sure - but as South you're still kicking yourself|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only one in 7@d on the board... Chili against Italy bog lead for them also|pg||
nt|yke:  some players might just open 1NT. But maybe they play 13-15 NT since they play precision?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: 15+ - 18 1NT.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Anyway, as Kit remarked, they have had to take a rather close view to reach game after their chosen start.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 15+ to me.  Maybe a 5 card major is a barrier for them.|pg||
nt|gracelin: bad lucks for China that HK is not on side.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: diamond lead will create problems with spades 4-2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact i dont see a way to make the hand|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|boedhy:  on board 6 I was right lot of peaple in 5@s even 4@s doubled...|pg||
nt|yke:  for me it is a 1NT opening. But that's just a matter of style|pg||
nt|gracelin: good play on route to 9 tricks.  Declarer can later duck a round of D, draw top trumps and pitch dummy's D on good H, then ruff a D.|pg||
nt|pelu: even with @HK onside there are hard work to make 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: same play if Hearts are 3-3, declarer can pitch one D on H to lose only 1S, 1D and 1C|pg||
nt|pelu: and 12 opp 11 - and bad @C-value is not game potentional in green|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer in 2S here needs to find way to encounter a possible 4-1 trumps break, thus the huddle.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: the hand might still prove difficult|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is north has a better hand than he might have, but not really enough to take control|pg||
nt|kareno: Spades break.  Or third club can be ruffed with ten of hearts.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North has a monster hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Italians can win imps either by overbidding or underbidding.  You have to admire their judgment.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is why when you are in 2s you draw trumps and claim 3, so you dont do something stupid on the important boards|pg||
nt|ady: nothing nuch on here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: some would overcall 1nt here, but pass looks fine with that shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and indeed Prooyen Verhees also bid it and even made a uptrick|pg||
nt|brolucius: The KR evaluator program seems to take a bizarre valuation of jacks. Roland quoted an example where Q-J doubleton was allocated only 0.75 points, compared with x-x. Seems much too ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little for me.|pg||
nt|athene: wait till they bid hearts, then double for takeout :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D shows H, as before|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: Their system got the bidding too elevated before south could describe his hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@d = 0-8|pg||
nt|athene: that's the classic recipe for that south hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Apteker was very happy to be in it and played very save..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@h = 19+|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = 6-8, balanced|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can they get 6@s in south....|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so any 4333 or 4432|pg||
nt|boedhy:  which is very good|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the Vul for weak NT.  North is in the range but decisde not to open on 5-4 distribution.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h and 3@C sh make - but thats max|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north did not open weak NT or rebid NT, south knows north has an unbalanced hand and should have 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: China in 2@H in OR|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D = kiery|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rhelle:  2@h = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@c = 4333 with a 4-card minor|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but the system will let it play in North probably and |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now versace runs to hearts and north doubles |pg||
nt|athene: but south won't (shouldn't) stick this, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: cue 2@H, check for 44 spades, bid 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: even though it's nice to go for penalties at this vulnerability, you know opps surely have an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: so defending at the 1-level might well be wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think not.  His pass of 1@d doubled was likely influenced by the vulnerability.  As it is north was on the thin side of the double and might have eschewed the double of 1@h ...|pg||
nt|kareno: with such thin hearts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is not making|pg||
nt|pelu: some work for 9 tricks here, |pg||
nt|gracelin: and as usual, Bocchi judged correct;y to stop in 3C|pg||
nt|barnets: looks ok to me|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: On this hand, East may have upgraded his hand to 18 points, with two tens that accompany other honours, and two 4-card suits.|pg||
nt|pelu: difficult lead for East|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but with Bocchi beind the wheel, I thk he can hold his loss to at most 4 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: looks though they are heading for game|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  3@d = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s = 3-3-4-3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  as South promises at least 1 control (a king), the North hand is now looking pretty good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then 6@s is is a little better then 50% because you can guess the @d and on a @d or non @d lead you get info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had he opened 1NT, which I assume shows 15-17, West would doubtless have stayed low. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Changing the 10,8 to the q,j on the hand above yields 17.5 points, still low but more reasonable.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Weinstein didn't even search for a 5-3 spade fit.  He judged that with 3-3 in hearts and clubs it was very unlikely that spades would take 2 more tricks than notrump, ...|pg||
nt|kit: which would be needed for 4@S to significantly gain over 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point.|pg||
nt|yke:  3NT is questionable to me. with a 5-3 fit you should play in spades when the long spades is the weak hand and in NT when the long spades is the strong hand|pg||
nt|yke:  because you might not be able to enjoy the long spades because of the entries|pg||
nt|kit: with AQx of clubs, there is no entry problem to the long spades|pg||
nt|yke:  good point|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson had a lot of water and now he goes to the toilet|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: At matchpoints there would be more incentive to look for a 5-3 spade fit, since making 1 extra trick in spades is worth something.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: after laying down his cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  ah! a variation :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s is a strong 1-suiter, |pg||
nt|gracelin: even with this lead, if declarer is to ruff spade, he might lose a 2nd trump trick.|pg||
nt|pelu: some cross-ruffing af 9 tricks now - even play for 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: so likely there are still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: def have no tricks|pg||
nt|ady: the lay out is friendlt|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 clubs one spade|pg||
nt|barnets: one heart or 1 diamond should make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle:  although why North wants to play a @s contract himself is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well South africa has bid it and made it|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in other room|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rhelle:  4@c is a cue|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: both 3NT  23 hcp|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|boedhy:  now...... sign of or low @d lead...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ai ... North may pass 4@s now|pg||
nt|lechcold: nietrafnie Grzegorz|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle:  I still think North would have done better to keep relay'ing|pg||
nt|brolucius: West at the other table did try to cash two spades against 5@S doubled and allowed the game to be made. |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one down against 4@S making in the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart five in north could possibly have been promoted to a trick with persistence in diamonds after cashing clubs.  The play is complex|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: very quick @H9|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking that if he doesn't overtake this and cash the @DK for a spade pitch, the defence can draw trumps and cash two spades|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case the nine was a poor choice because it opens him to the promotion.|pg||
nt|athene: but the trick comes back for the defence with a trump promotion in diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, he is always losing out one way or another - even if he didn't waste the nine, the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|athene: for example on a diamond if he can ruff high north can pitch a club and get a club ruff with the @H5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but, let's be honest, it's a marginal slam. Around 50%, so staying out of it is no shame|pg||
nt|pelu: @C9 8 7 6 are strong ruffs|pg||
nt|gracelin: east has doubled 1C, so he doesn't have a singleton HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now ruffing finesse in spade is the safe route|pg||
nt|gracelin: if instead, going to dummy with HQ and play another trump, West can win CK and play D to force declare losing control.|pg||
nt|barnets: with 4 tens and 3 nines though :)|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice intermediate spot cards|pg||
nt|ady: it is possible to mis guess spade|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: 5@C doubled, I mean.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|boedhy:  and the small @d lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kareno: Note the diamond ten, calling for a club (and why did north not play the spade queen on that first spade trick to show possession of the jack?)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this hand could have been made too|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: anyway, a game swing back to bulgaria when duboin made a costly lead of @CA from AQJ against the 4@S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: to be fair, it was harder for him to lead a heart when declarer had actually bid the suit|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: K@H exit now|pg||
nt|barnets: yes he needs to guess it|pg||
nt|barnets: same situation exactly in open|pg||
nt|barnets: @HK to ace|pg||
nt|barnets: the n@SQ|pg||
nt|barnets: from dec|pg||
nt|ady: north knows that east is aware of the diamond position and cannot afford to cash the queen  so would exit with a heart even with K@S|pg||
nt|barnets: brings home contract|pg||
nt|barnets: made by grue in open|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: yes   that would be winning line|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|boedhy:  thirst imps to south africa|pg||
nt|ady: but if the king was with east that would fail|pg||
nt|barnets: so in open dec decided west had @SK so corectly led the @SQ in case he had !KJXX|pg||
nt|barnets: @SKJxx|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|brolucius: His partner had opened 1@H and he could not believe that he would hold five spades.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|pelu: so "only" 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|brolucius: Still, a heart switch looked OK, because East could then switch back to spades.|pg||
nt|gracelin: for the same effect.  9 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|barnets: must get it right now|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe not|pg||
nt|ady: if Bocchi does not make  USA will be well ahead|pg||
nt|barnets: the great players usually get this situation right at the table|pg||
nt|ady: giving due consideration|pg||
nt|barnets: using their table presence|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphznt: a short break - players are going to the bathroom|pg||

nt|santyclz: One of the few hands where blackwood answers all your questions.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players use it as game-forcing rather than 'limit or better'.|pg||
nt|kareno: If west leads that tempting diamond it is all over for south.|pg||

mb|6H|nt|brolucius: What would he bid with 7-8 and a doubleton spade?|pg||
nt|kit: he would bid 2@H, transfer to 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see. It is good to have such accurate methods.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS conducted a Gazzilli auction here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C is normal response to forcing 1NT or any 16-17 up hand, 2D is 8 p and GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and 40 minutes for 6 boards is not much...|pg||
nt|brolucius: For the past few weeks I have been doing voice commentary instead of tap-in commentary. It is good to see that I can still type OK. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: 5@S was a fine bid by south|pg||
nt|barnets: holding just J high trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: he kept a grandslam option open|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wouldn't have risked it with those trumps!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 5@S was less serious try then 5NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: than|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Bob for the bidding explanations. How they find time for it, as well as putting in all the bids and plays, I will never know.|pg||
nt|ady: what is best lone in 7    ruff 4 clubs in south hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: with such good trumps perhaps north should have accepted the invitation to the party|pg||
pc|c9|nt|boedhy:  luckly easy 3nt..|pg||
nt|barnets: the key to bidding many slams is who has control of the high trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: north knows his partner has invited a grand slam|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: East (Sementa) lead @sA - but then in trick 2 @DA :(:(|pg||
nt|famus: cud b a swing|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't blame him.  He was looking at his 2 Aces, and these Chinese did bid slam off 2 Aces before.|pg||
nt|barnets: and he has AKQ of trumps|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: so 11 to 14 IMP on way for China|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|famus: may be--cant say till it ends|pg||
nt|gracelin: As north has not shown his 6th spade here, East may not find the killing defense.  However, without cashing SA, I thk 6C is still in trouble.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he has shown 6sp and 4H already|pg||
nt|pelu: will S pass to 4@s?|pg||
nt|gracelin: don;t thk North will ass, South has shown 8+|pg||
nt|ady: not enough entries to ruff 4 clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see how important the 4@C bid was set the slam ball rolling. If you could only bid 4@C with a club control, it would be a tricky time for North.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: The advantage of doing the tap-in commentary is that you have a split second to check whether your comment is completely stupid before you press enter.|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but then when you do say something stupid you look so bad :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Against that, some duff comment is preserved for posterity on the VuGraph web-sites. If you say something clueless, no-one records it and you can hope that the spectators thought ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: you were joking.  |pg||
pc|h4|nt|boedhy:  still @h stop|pg||
nt|gracelin: pass|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rensph:  North might very well have bid 6NT after discovering @SA and the lack of a club stopper in partner's hand|pg||
nt|famus: he knows 11@s|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: ruffing 3 diamonds in runs risk of 10@H making for defence   I think small slam is enough|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  south will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|athene: hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Two - no need to preempt with a solid opening bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China has another chance here, 6S is cold|pg||
nt|fluffy: not your everyday vulnerable preempt|pg||
nt|fluffy: 6@s is far from cold requiers a good guess i ntrumps or in the minors|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Italy they say Vulnerability is for children and Bocchi is no children.|pg||
nt|fluffy: normally you should gues trumps, but you are not entry rich to dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but they won't use the bid with this hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rhelle:  2NT = balanced|pg||
nt|kit: This is as flat a 4@H hand as you will find, it sppears.|pg||

nt|pelu: Shi didnt dare to cue 4@d|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: he had taken a bid but took it back|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rhelle:  (no singleton or void)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rensph:  6@S makes on the rather fortunate heart position here, but they'll likely end up in 4@S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|boedhy:  2227 balanced tehese days :)|pg||
nt|athene: wow, only 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to bid a few more than that after partner doubles clubs for takeout|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: this should be down, even down two is possible|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|boedhy:  well maybe south should go for 3nt then ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|boedhy:  sort of wrongsided it now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could it be slam looking form south...|pg||
nt|kareno: I also play that double as takeout.  And they have a light opening style with the forcing club system.|pg||
nt|rensph:  wouldn't want to get anywhere near 6@S usually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best now is spade shift|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: USA 1 took a big lead when China went down in 4@S rather than the 3nt on bd 25.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You remember the deal where Levin upgraded a 17-count to 18, reaching 3NT opposite 7? China played that deal in 4@S, on a 5-3 fit and went one down. So, Kit's advice on the deal, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that West should not seek a 5-3 spade fit proved to be good advice.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they are there, I am quite sure Shi will take 12 tricks.  He is the best player in the team and reach semi final in BB in 2009.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fluffy: if declarer missguesses trumps he will need to find @dQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: or squeeze south in the reds|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a difficult task|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S = 2Aces + @SQ - Lian exp @sAKQ :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he even has time to establish a long Heart|pg||
nt|famus: natural for him to play !j--but if he opts to play a small @s--the play ends at trick 2|pg||
nt|famus: @sj|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the vugraph schedule so you can plan your days and weeks      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|pelu: he know that N is short in @S, so he could play @S6|pg||
nt|famus: that wud end the thrill!!:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has so many entry to dummy, so I thk to take CA and play small spade to finesse S10 is the right play|pg||
nt|fluffy: Imaine for example playing a low spade and south ducking @sK9xx he might lock you in dummy with a heart and you have no way back to hand except destoying you chances of stablishing ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: this will be the 3. slam-swing in the match - the first 2 gave China 25 IMP and prob 12 more here|pg||
nt|gracelin: China should be proud of themself in outbidding the Italians in 3 slams in one set.  If Shi makes this.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: but one of the slam only maded on a defensiv error|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: various ways to come to nine tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: take a ruffing finesse in spades is one|pg||
pc|c4|nt|boedhy:  offcourse it was 50% but south has a very strong hand imo|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi must be thinking harder than we do except he is not looking at all 4 hands.  I am sure the line he chooses is the best one.|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the page for the result fromthe 3 events     http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|famus: so the Chinese wud b the first to put a dent in this Italian Juggernaut--They've rolled over evry other opponent mercilessly, and i dare say artfully till now|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|rensph:  pointed out to me that it's not 12 tricks if E leads a club through, so S would have to play the hand in order to succeed. :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: And all he needs are eight :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|athene: now overruff, diamond shift kills the dummy entry|pg||
nt|gracelin: now he need to guess DQ for his slam.  Declarer may try Heart 3-3 first,|pg||
nt|pelu: did he realy need to play @SJ?|pg||
nt|famus: so he has to play on the red suit squeeze but i think must surrender a @S NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: I say no, since he as so many reentries to dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: so only 8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|famus: to keep trump control and check out @hs|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|rhelle:  so far NS have 12 plus scores - they will be happy|pg||
nt|gracelin: at this Vul. 2D shows 4S and 5+ minor with 5-11 pts|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2c was 18-19 , madala passed|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|barnets: quel systeme !|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: this upgrade may get them to the good slam, 2@S followed by 4@C splinter|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: some might be tempted to double this with north but he does not have that great a hand|pg||
nt|athene: you either need a shortage so you can get some ruffs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|boedhy:  yes they will be pretty confident about there list|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only board 9 is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  It was bid and made at most tables|pg||
nt|athene: or you need such good trumps you just make them by force|pg||
nt|kareno: Nanev very close to a second double.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't know you were bi-lingual.|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention that 2@C on a passed hand should show a sound raise in partner's major was banned for years by the English Bridge Union.  They thought it allowed players to psyche ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in 3rd seat....|pg||
nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
nt|athene: he really has not got that much defence|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case, north might sit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is no doubt what he is thinking about.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rensph:  only worry of declarer here is to avoid losing 2 spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: with the knowledge of south's 4-cad spade, declarer can take deep finesse there to get 4S, 1H, 2C and 2D.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: 5@h= 2 aces no @sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see it is 14-16, so not an upgrade, and to me worth 4@D over 4@C since diamonds good for many discards|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Weinstein worried about a club ruff, so may play two top spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 37 IMP for China on 3 slams !|pg||
nt|gracelin: as there are only 2 entries to dummy, he could cash SA first to see what's north singleton, when the S7 shown, he know to double hook S10 and SQ|pg||
nt|fokal: he can evan afford to cash the @s As|pg||
nt|famus: this shud b a swing back to Italy if @s dont go to deep fin|pg||
nt|fokal: *even|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fluffy: in 4@s, 4 players made, 10 players went down|pg||
nt|fluffy: making 3NT is for sure a supperb score|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Italian declarer must be among the 4 that make|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer lacks the entries for finesse south for Q107x, so he must hope north hold one of the Q, 10, or 7.  So cas SA and take the double hook|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer can fleely cash @sA now right?|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kareno: This is a hand I would rather leave to partner to declare always - too many choices.  I agree that a club to the ten is tempting.  The diamonds have opened a path for the defense.|pg||

mb|d|nt|boedhy:  throwing imps like candy..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board, we start again at 13.45|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: that is in 1 hour|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes do you know there agreements|pg||
nt|rhelle:  they play dstructive preempts this vul(doesn't everybody?)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  what is the range|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but the temptation to bid 6@c must be strong|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt overcall perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: would be interesting to see how lauria-versace handle such interference|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like a normal 4H hand on this last deal of the set.|pg||
nt|barnets: east overcalled one heart in open|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has preferred a double to 1@H (the modern choice) and may escape a penalty.|pg||
nt|ady: great result for USA here in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course they opened 1@D at the other table.|pg||
mb|1D!|an|!H's|nt|rhelle:  getting to 6@d now is too hard, I think|pg||
nt|rensph:  Even if spades break 4-1 taking the ace and returning a spade works equally well|pg||
nt|antoniz: bardzo trudny po otwarcie przeciwnika|pg||
nt|fabsayc: about the time they finish in open room :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: So many thanks to Bob Drijver our excellent Operator.  To the specs for their wit and wisdom.  To Bill Frisby for his contributions and, of course, to WBF for allowing us to watch ...|pg||
nt|kareno: their marvelous production of the world championships.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Opened room started 10 minutes later than this room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are bidding 15 there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: because the match is on VuGraph|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: bocchi pointing out 3H makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  4@d may be an artificial slam try in @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will bid 5@c now expecting @h points|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally, this double shows a desire to penalize opps, but my guess is EW just use it to show some values|pg||
nt|barnets: I prefer the unfortunate 1@H bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: 1@D will be a transfer bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The next session starts in around 1 hours and 10 minutes. It will be the last session of the day.|pg||
nt|kit: This time it is right to play the 5-3 major-suit fit|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even promising spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board for the day, back tomorrow at 10.30 Paris time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: here at the playing site in Veldhoven|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our excellent operator Jan Nielsen|pg||
mb|1N|nt|boedhy:  still liking his hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite this loss of Italy they still do lead the Round Robin pack after round 5|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rensph:  in this layout it all mattered very little, had north held the @HK it would've been a very effective @SQ|pg||
nt|famus: i rate them favourite to win|pg||
nt|gracelin: some care is needed here.  But I am confident Shi will also bring this home.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: LIAN already left the table|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a well educated quess Famus±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: the next match will start in 40 minutes from now.  Tks all for watching and hope you have enjoyed some great hands.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will also like to thank Felipe, our most capable operator who explained many bidding sequences to us.|pg||
nt|pelu: a way to play is @cA - @H to Q, @hA and then 4x@D discard @s, then @C AND MAKING 11|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks tough for E )DD very easy'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he is afraid for @H loss @C@C and @SA for down 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer want to cash HA first as a safety play(he could afford t lose one trump), but here the threat for club overruff made that play not totally safe.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and very afraid for ducking this IF S 6 card @C|pg||
nt|famus: playing @hA is sure wau to -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7 card|pg||
nt|famus: 6 cards he has so needs to duck|pg||
nt|gracelin: with a 7-card club suit at this Vul. south may have bid more.  so duck the first club then take trump finesse maybe a good way.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope he does not go for the line @CA @HA x@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: dojd¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba...|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: and to the spectators for some alert analysis|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and to the commentator for an excellent job |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do you think 3@d is forcing or not here?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W seems to be in doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  now pass finally|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good sequence - 5@c is again 50% at best|pg||
nt|boedhy:  slam again 50% or so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well the 6 card trump support is hardly clear|pg||
mb|2N|nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North: you guys have a bit of a @h fit|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, you'd better reserve your seats for the entire tournament - there is much wonderful bridge coming up!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W decides that 3@d was non forcing and passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder if he has A10x in spades if things would have been different|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Li just left the room -- and now Liu is on his own -- will he manage that?|pg||
nt|ehsana: .....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile 5@D in open room going down undoubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi now has a decision to make. Pass, 2NT, 3@D? He has chosen 2NT.|pg||
nt|ady: request for a link to running scores please|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rensph:  3N is made on a heart lead and continuation here, but if defenders set up a diamond trick early on declarer will still have to find the @SQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  I'm also informed that lauria made 4@S on this hand|pg||
nt|rensph:  3NT, sorry|pg||
nt|jacksond: if plays donde for spade queen he makes quite easily|pg||
nt|rensph:  sorry, 3N making with clubs 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North realised that his partner must have had some purpose in bidding 2@C checkback. When it turned out that he was not looking for four hearts, he knew that he must have been ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: looking for a 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@C Krzysztof potraktowa³ jako normalny cue-bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and offcourse this one is down on @s lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  thinking about it, 6@c is down on a @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: 10 easy tricks with spades splitting, but only 8 in notrump|pg||
nt|brolucius: if you want to listen to Voice Commentary, you should go directly to website: http://www.bridgebase.com/|pg||
pc|s2|nt|famus: yes--too tired--as pointed out by informed kibtz-- taking @H  A wud need to squeeze|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphznt: Bye for now|pg||
nt|kareno: So that's it and Italy will get most or all of the VPs for this match.  Well done!!|pg||
nt|rensph:  lets see how declarer handles 4@S here though|pg||
nt|gracelin: He play Hear to break 2-2 or a singleton honor drops.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pity|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy recovered 19 mps in last 2 boards for a tied match.  Bye all|pg||

nt|barnets: should the two teams meet later on in the KO stages|pg||
nt|barnets: a good match and especially fine performance by the young USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: East doubled 1@C, so not certain that declarer will score four diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will not hold a singleton diamond for his double, so declarer will start with the @DK.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|ady: especially getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|barnets: this will still be a small swing to USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: With -500 on there partners' card, it was very much the right thing to do (as it happens) to bid game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..their..|pg||
nt|barnets: who will win this match and have a carry forward of some kind|pg||
nt|ady: may make even with 3 diamonds    as long as playing 1st club from north|pg||
pc|s4|nt|boedhy:  well good start for the Netherlands...and with all these difficult and lively boards fun to watch|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|barnets: I am not sure of the exact carryovers but it usually depends on which team finishes higher in the round robin|pg||
nt|brolucius: West false-carded the @DQ, to mislead declarer as to the position of the @DJ.|pg||
