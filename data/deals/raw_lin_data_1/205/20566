nt|alunand14: yes.... + 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|farrukh: so it seems that there may be some ruling involved looking at the bidding and the table score for board 8|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i thought other room played 6@H  but movie showing 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which way do you think score will be adjusted??|pg||
mb|2H|nt|farrukh: i am told that they played 6@h is right.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: 2@C CHECKBACK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jaapfr: likely end score Indonesia wins 49-39|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s = 3 card spades|pg||
nt|farrukh: but now either it is operator error or Director's ruling, so we'll get the update shortly|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   6@H moved back to 4@H was the adjustment|pg||
nt|farrukh: in fact most likely its a director's ruling because the score showed a pushed board and then it changed later|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here -1 (how to get @SQ SD:)?|pg||
