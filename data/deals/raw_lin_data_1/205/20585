pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: a large number of pairs in the Bermuda Bowl are playing  1m-(1@H)-1@S = 0-3@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for them  DBL = 4/5@S and they have other bids for 6+@S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cicus: e.g. 2@H|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: my immediate reaction is that it has same benefit of all transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there is a large group - especially in north america  that wants to apply law of total tricks   so  Neg DBL = exactly 4@S and 1@S=5+|pg||

nt|cicus: upmark-cullin system notes (page 4) confirm your explanation, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 7   Nystrom-Bertheau got shut out of @S, sold to 2@C South  and Pakistan on the board with 11 imps|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Nystrom opened East hand  1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ahmed playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand much easier to play seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|cicus: very true - drawing trumps results in only 8 tricks if @S do not break|pg||

nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D not 2@C???|pg||
nt|ritong: weird|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Dennis, thank you for the hard work done |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: you're welcome :) thank you for the commentary|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|sfoxa:  World Champioship is a unique opportunity to follow 10 tables in a while|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: weird = underbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 1@d is conventional|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 8-11?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision opening bids for EW    1@D should be 2+   2@C=6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they've made 2@C DENY 4 card major  i'm checking cc now|pg||
nt|3for3: i dont think they play 1@D guarantees 2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, hope, kibs enjoyed comparing the matter of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3NT can't be beaten here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: chance now to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but east has a minimum, at least in my book|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: maybe west should have bid it already|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a vulnerable overcall at 2-level should show a good hand in my opinion|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ open team were in 5@D making|pg||
mb|3D|nt|farrukh: so it seems that there may be some ruling involved looking at the bidding and the table score for board 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right Danny -- they play 2@D=mini-multi|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: in their big win over USA2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i thought other room played 6@H  but movie showing 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which way do you think score will be adjusted??|pg||
mb|p|nt|farrukh: i am told that they played 6@h is right.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the chinese women even bought the contract now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: 2@C CHECKBACK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: likely end score Indonesia wins 49-39|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the last board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  Note 26   2@C=6@C  no 4M but maybe 5M|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: just in time|pg||
nt|ritong: benedicte could try the cue in pard's known shortness|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: but..|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s = 3 card spades|pg||
nt|farrukh: but now either it is operator error or Director's ruling, so we'll get the update shortly|pg||
nt|ritong: you never know|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzpb: to pick up a few imps, instead of losing 11 if New Zealand would have bid 3NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   6@H moved back to 4@H was the adjustment|pg||
nt|farrukh: in fact most likely its a director's ruling because the score showed a pushed board and then it changed later|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here -1 (how to get @SQ SD:)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Egypt-Israel  USA2-Italy  Brazil-USA1   all BB on voice tomorrow|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
