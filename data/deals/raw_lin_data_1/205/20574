mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: the later round of bidding is not explained in their CC so we will have to take some guess.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6S is more comfortable a contract than 6D.|pg||

nt|brolucius: East tries to slip through a 9th trick in diamonds. |pg||
nt|brolucius: By leading the jack, pretending to finesse against the Q, he aims to catch South asleep. Not today!|pg||
nt|desinka: hello all|pg||

mb|1H|nt|athene: NS play strong club, UDCA|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|brolucius: East has bid 2@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5H will be very expensive at this Vul.|pg||

nt|rensph:  seems we're back and good to go. :) Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: but often the opponents will not believe they are given a gift|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|brolucius: When the opponents find a fit and then stop at the two level, the other side know that the points are divided and that they will likely have a fit somewhere.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|gracelin: declarer needs to guess trump to make this, but I am afraid he will not.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mathat: @c is 2-2|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gracelin: from the 5H bid and the double, it's likely that north has a singleton trump|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gracelin: how can he believe north bids 5H at unfav Vul. with this 5422 hand.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer finesses in spades, seeking a discard for one of his diamond losers.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|kit: The location of the king of spades means that South does well in 3@C, but the same location means that E-W won't make 3@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after all, north only bid 2H in first round.  So maybe declarer will figure it out.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will have to finish this and re start to link with other table so after this hand ill close this|pg||
nt|gracelin: got it|pg||

nt|Walddk4: This room will be shut down shortly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: moment of truth. he would love to finesse the SJ but entry is not cnvenient|pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the first time Lian plays for China.  His partner Shi is a veteran and reach semi-final in the 2009 BB|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rhelle:  NS had a relay sequence, where North asked South questions about his distribution and strength|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: You can see what a good idea it was for North to keep the bidding alive over 2@H (which would have made). You should always be reluctant to let the opponents play at the two-level ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in a fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he's on the wrong track|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mathat: think bocchi in vuln bid 5 with sngl @s|pg||
nt|gracelin: south cannot hace a singleton club, or he would lead one for the ruff, so the finesse is to play south for 3-5-3-2 very unlikely since north is raising 2H with 6|pg||

nt|gracelin: rehi everyone|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|rhelle:  East will be tempted to pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North may respond 4@S  to his partner's one-bid. No, he has preferred 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we are up to speed now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to claim the first 2 |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is two down, assuming the defence attack clubs early enough|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|rhelle:  And now West has a problem. 2@s is non forcing, but he has a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: but nanev, with singleton spade facing a takeout double, might bid on|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rhelle:  He doesn't know about the wasted @h values in his partner's hand, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of auction some play 2NT by the opener as weak-strong. That allows them to show a strong 3@C rebid (by bidding 3@C) or a shapely weaker one (via 2NT).|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: fearing his opponents have a huge fit and more shape than they do have|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: This is interesting.  East will lead a high heart and shift to a minor.  But does he shift to the suit where he has the king, or where he doesn't?  That is what declarer will have ...|pg||
nt|kit: to judge.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, this is interesting|pg||
nt|antoniz: witaj Grzegorz:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: when he bids 4nt you might think it is offering two places to play, in which case he should pass 5@C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: N/S are not playing a strong 1@C system. That is probably why North did not want to make a pre-emptive 4@S response - in case his partner was strong and they could make a slam.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W has no quick entry to allow a @s thru.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rhelle:  the problem for East is communication. He can throw @cs on @h KQ, but how to get there?|pg||
nt|brolucius: When dummy has only one card in the suit led, the partner of the opening leader can give a suit preference card to suggest a switch.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|gracelin: Lian was in a tough situation to guess the trump layout under the bidding.  Italy really earned this swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2s was 5+ spades veery weak|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sementa led a trump in the other room against 4S, which is tougher for declarer.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphznt: 2 clubs 15+ any reverse without 3spades or nat|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: sometimes when you have a scrambling bid like this you can use it to show a weak bid in the highest-ranking suit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: Now club ruff, heart ruff, and eventual diamond finesse will make|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North needs to take and shift to a @c - but not sure even that is enough|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a high spade, if 10 or J drops, he may ruff to hand to ruff the 3rd H.  If nothing drops, just pull the other trump|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: in other words 5@H over 4@S would be "good" and 4nt - whatever - 5@H is "bad"|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: I wonder what declarer would have done on a diamond shift|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rhelle:  the @h2 may help - Lavinthal for @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Of course, North also doesn't know that the 2@h opening was so weak in @h|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rhelle:  this is exciting - looks like a @d slam for NS|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: 6@c 1@d  o 5-4 minore sing @S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rhelle:  1@s = @h, unbalanced|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine not bidding 3@C on South hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows major-minor, shapely|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1NT = relay|pg||
mb|2S|nt|boedhy:  Rob Helle is teh coinventor of teh system Muller de Wijs are playing|pg||
nt|athene: overcalls are 3 or 4 cards with a longer suit somewhere else|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@h = 4@h, 5+@d|pg||
nt|athene: so according to that scheme, lauria could have overcalled 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe, vulnerable, he thinks it's unduly risky|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like fairly old-fashioned precision club, so NS are just bidding naturally after the 1@C|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@s = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2NT = short in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: quite possible that in the other room west opens a weak 2@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: good convention.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but lauria-versace seem to be very conservative with their weak twos, and weak jump bids in general|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's seems those Italians always have a right gadget to describe their hands perfectly.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if ducked to HQ, a club shift will beat it.  So declarer may decide to go up with HK and wor on spade|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s = 0-4-6-3|pg||
nt|boedhy:  WIESMULLER = Tarzan that is what they called their system|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Now North knows the @c losers will go on the @s AK|pg||

pc|dK|nt|rhelle:  so he will get excited!|pg||
nt|kit: And in fact, N-S have profitable save in 5@C, and pushing opponents to 5@H (which likely would have happened) is a big bonus|pg||
nt|athene: slam might be harder to reach if west opened 2@S - what do you do with that north hand? just punt 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, no need to pre-empt opps if they don't bid slams even when given a free run|pg||
nt|athene: really you should not miss this slam|pg||
nt|athene: if you play a strong club and opps politely yield you the floor|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rhelle:  4@c = relay, asking for controls|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still needs the third round @H control|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@d = 2 controls; an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he ask for it?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, and he will|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@h = relay, asking for high cards|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|rhelle:  5@c = @dK, @hK, nothing in @c|pg||

pc|dT|nt|rhelle:  5@d = asking for more high cards|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@s = DQ, not @hQ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  On the last board at the other table Verhees van Prooyen were in the better 3nt contract, which on the layout is cold..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so a good start for teh home team.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so really, NS are unlucky that South's red Q is in @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  otherwise they'd bid 7@d|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would have been better to raise clubs right away|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still think a lot of pairs will end up in 7 @d tho and i dont see a way to make it|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@h I don't understand - that is a sign-off|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in my version - clearly they play this differently|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rhelle:  I guess that they could sign off in 5@d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  taht should be possible...|pg||

nt|santyclz: Roland agrees.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It has always staggered me that so many very good players use it.|pg||
nt|kit: big advantage of Flannery is that you don't have to respond 1@S to 1@H on a 4-bagger, so opener knows it shows 5.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|kit: Now, when West shifts to a heart East will have to deduce that reason West didn't cash second spade is that it isn't cashing.|pg||

pc|h4|nt|brolucius: When declarer runs the trumps West will have to keep the @SA and so unguard the diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would allow declarer to pick up the suit when West held x-x-x (and had to throw one) and East started with Q-x. |pg||

nt|athene: of course if he has a singleton spade you are down too :) but if he has doubleton, what are the odds it is Qx?|pg||
nt|kareno: He is the opening bidder which changes things somewhat.|pg||
nt|kareno: And no @h k|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sure, it was close call|pg||
nt|athene: the @H10 here makes 6@H better|pg||
nt|athene: i mean better than it might have been :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he doesn't like his CK after the double|pg||
nt|pelu: but the D of 2@C sh slow N down|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kamyk: ta kontra, to typowa akcja Narkiewicza - nie ma ziewania|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: South could have a doubleton spade and a 6-count it would seem.  Unless these bids don't mean what they look like.|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@h is practically laydown while 6@s relies on 3-2 spades pretty well.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, indeed.  A good stop, probably enough for them to ake the lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: take|pg||
pc|sK|nt|boedhy:  And apteker will get the @c right|pg||
nt|lechcold: wa¿ne, ¿e walet trefl jest tam gdzie byæ powinien:)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like 4@S down 1 or 2 = 5-6 IMP for Italy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|athene: if south knows his partner's shape then 6@H looks clear, with the good suit texture, even not knowing of the @H10 opposite|pg||
nt|kareno: Still it is hard to posit such a perfect fit.|pg||
nt|athene: a pity - my guess is south found out distribution but didn't know he was facing so many prime cards|pg||
nt|kareno: I would guess Italy will find the slam in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: and he didn't have any way to make a mild slam try in hearts - if he had done so, north would surely have accepted|pg||

nt|boedhy:  for the runnning scores click on live scores bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still think much more system default or bidding mistake from Gower that they were not bidding it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  But Muller wil be thinking about this...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  sure - but as South you're still kicking yourself|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only one in 7@d on the board... Chili against Italy bog lead for them also|pg||
nt|yke:  some players might just open 1NT. But maybe they play 13-15 NT since they play precision?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|brolucius: 15+ - 18 1NT.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|brolucius: Anyway, as Kit remarked, they have had to take a rather close view to reach game after their chosen start.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 15+ to me.  Maybe a 5 card major is a barrier for them.|pg||
nt|gracelin: bad lucks for China that HK is not on side.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|boedhy:  on board 6 I was right lot of peaple in 5@s even 4@s doubled...|pg||
nt|yke:  for me it is a 1NT opening. But that's just a matter of style|pg||
nt|gracelin: good play on route to 9 tricks.  Declarer can later duck a round of D, draw top trumps and pitch dummy's D on good H, then ruff a D.|pg||
nt|pelu: even with @HK onside there are hard work to make 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: same play if Hearts are 3-3, declarer can pitch one D on H to lose only 1S, 1D and 1C|pg||
nt|pelu: and 12 opp 11 - and bad @C-value is not game potentional in green|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer in 2S here needs to find way to encounter a possible 4-1 trumps break, thus the huddle.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|athene: the hand might still prove difficult|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is north has a better hand than he might have, but not really enough to take control|pg||
nt|kareno: Spades break.  Or third club can be ruffed with ten of hearts.|pg||

nt|brolucius: South had a choice of 2@H, 3@H and 2@S on the second. Maybe even 2NT. He was fortunate to find the game after choosing 2@S.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North has a monster hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Italians can win imps either by overbidding or underbidding.  You have to admire their judgment.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|athene: some would overcall 1nt here, but pass looks fine with that shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and indeed Prooyen Verhees also bid it and even made a uptrick|pg||
nt|brolucius: The KR evaluator program seems to take a bizarre valuation of jacks. Roland quoted an example where Q-J doubleton was allocated only 0.75 points, compared with x-x. Seems much too ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little for me.|pg||
nt|athene: wait till they bid hearts, then double for takeout :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D shows H, as before|pg||
mb|2D!|an|4!h|nt|kareno: Their system got the bidding too elevated before south could describe his hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@d = 0-8|pg||
nt|athene: that's the classic recipe for that south hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Apteker was very happy to be in it and played very save..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@h = 19+|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = 6-8, balanced|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can they get 6@s in south....|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so any 4333 or 4432|pg||
nt|boedhy:  which is very good|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the Vul for weak NT.  North is in the range but decisde not to open on 5-4 distribution.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h and 3@C sh make - but thats max|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north did not open weak NT or rebid NT, south knows north has an unbalanced hand and should have 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: China in 2@H in OR|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D = kiery|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@h = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@c = 4333 with a 4-card minor|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but the system will let it play in North probably and |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now versace runs to hearts and north doubles |pg||
nt|athene: but south won't (shouldn't) stick this, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: cue 2@H, check for 44 spades, bid 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: even though it's nice to go for penalties at this vulnerability, you know opps surely have an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: so defending at the 1-level might well be wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think not.  His pass of 1@d doubled was likely influenced by the vulnerability.  As it is north was on the thin side of the double and might have eschewed the double of 1@h ...|pg||
nt|kareno: with such thin hearts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is not making|pg||
nt|pelu: some work for 9 tricks here, |pg||
nt|gracelin: and as usual, Bocchi judged correct;y to stop in 3C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: On this hand, East may have upgraded his hand to 18 points, with two tens that accompany other honours, and two 4-card suits.|pg||
nt|pelu: difficult lead for East|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but with Bocchi beind the wheel, I thk he can hold his loss to at most 4 tricks.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rhelle:  3@d = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s = 3-3-4-3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  as South promises at least 1 control (a king), the North hand is now looking pretty good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then 6@s is is a little better then 50% because you can guess the @d and on a @d or non @d lead you get info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had he opened 1NT, which I assume shows 15-17, West would doubtless have stayed low. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Changing the 10,8 to the q,j on the hand above yields 17.5 points, still low but more reasonable.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Weinstein didn't even search for a 5-3 spade fit.  He judged that with 3-3 in hearts and clubs it was very unlikely that spades would take 2 more tricks than notrump, ...|pg||
nt|kit: which would be needed for 4@S to significantly gain over 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point.|pg||
nt|yke:  3NT is questionable to me. with a 5-3 fit you should play in spades when the long spades is the weak hand and in NT when the long spades is the strong hand|pg||
nt|yke:  because you might not be able to enjoy the long spades because of the entries|pg||
nt|kit: with AQx of clubs, there is no entry problem to the long spades|pg||
nt|yke:  good point|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: At matchpoints there would be more incentive to look for a 5-3 spade fit, since making 1 extra trick in spades is worth something.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ah! a variation :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s is a strong 1-suiter, |pg||
nt|gracelin: even with this lead, if declarer is to ruff spade, he might lose a 2nd trump trick.|pg||
nt|pelu: some cross-ruffing af 9 tricks now - even play for 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: so likely there are still 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle:  although why North wants to play a @s contract himself is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well South africa has bid it and made it|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rhelle:  4@c is a cue|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|boedhy:  now...... sign of or low @d lead...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ai ... North may pass 4@s now|pg||
nt|lechcold: nietrafnie Grzegorz|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rhelle:  I still think North would have done better to keep relay'ing|pg||
nt|brolucius: West at the other table did try to cash two spades against 5@S doubled and allowed the game to be made. |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one down against 4@S making in the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart five in north could possibly have been promoted to a trick with persistence in diamonds after cashing clubs.  The play is complex|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: very quick @H9|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking that if he doesn't overtake this and cash the @DK for a spade pitch, the defence can draw trumps and cash two spades|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case the nine was a poor choice because it opens him to the promotion.|pg||
nt|athene: but the trick comes back for the defence with a trump promotion in diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, he is always losing out one way or another - even if he didn't waste the nine, the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|athene: for example on a diamond if he can ruff high north can pitch a club and get a club ruff with the @H5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but, let's be honest, it's a marginal slam. Around 50%, so staying out of it is no shame|pg||
nt|pelu: @C9 8 7 6 are strong ruffs|pg||
nt|gracelin: east has doubled 1C, so he doesn't have a singleton HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now ruffing finesse in spade is the safe route|pg||
nt|gracelin: if instead, going to dummy with HQ and play another trump, West can win CK and play D to force declare losing control.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: 5@C doubled, I mean.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|nt|boedhy:  and the small @d lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: Note the diamond ten, calling for a club (and why did north not play the spade queen on that first spade trick to show possession of the jack?)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: anyway, a game swing back to bulgaria when duboin made a costly lead of @CA from AQJ against the 4@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: to be fair, it was harder for him to lead a heart when declarer had actually bid the suit|pg||

nt|boedhy:  thirst imps to south africa|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s9|pc|d5|nt|brolucius: His partner had opened 1@H and he could not believe that he would hold five spades.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: so "only" 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|dJ|pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Still, a heart switch looked OK, because East could then switch back to spades.|pg||
nt|gracelin: for the same effect.  9 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphznt: a short break - players are going to the bathroom|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|athene: interesting decision for south now|pg||

nt|antoniz: szlemiczek na impasie,zobaczymy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|kareno: My choice under the circumstances would probably be the losing 3nt.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|brolucius: 2NT is just marked as strong raise on the cards, but must be GF or South would not have bid just 3@H. |pg||
nt|santyclz: One of the few hands where blackwood answers all your questions.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players use it as game-forcing rather than 'limit or better'.|pg||
nt|kareno: If west leads that tempting diamond it is all over for south.|pg||
nt|athene: well 3nt hasn't got many tricks even if the @DQ isn't found|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually 3nt is doomed anyway but the diamond makes it quicker :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|boedhy:  south difficult decision now|pg||

nt|boedhy:  first double?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  penalties, no doubt - 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West did not alert 2@C, thinks natural|pg||
nt|boedhy:  second double still take out|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2nd is take-out|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: 2D is a safer contract than 1NT which can be set with 3S, 3C and a H.  Bocchi made a great lead to pave the way for a successful defense.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|boedhy:  2@c minors|pg||
nt|rhelle:  oh, that lead will make EW trump short|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and if then NS play 3 rounds of trumps, the roof will come down|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this will be disaster for EW|pg||
nt|rhelle:  especially as the West hand is dummy, so the defence is much easier that way|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes|pg||
nt|boedhy:  the fact that he could lead the @s ten|pg||
nt|pelu: what a lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  quiet 1NT for EW here, diamonds break 4-4 so will end up with 6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|gracelin: admittedly, he has no good lead with his hand.  He'd rather attack dummy's suit than declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south thinks to overtake and shift if north leads from doubleton K10, south has no entry to eastablish his spade anyway.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: in OR @H-lead from N - and easy make|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W pokazal 4333 10-13|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|boedhy:  now he will try to ruff a @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so close to 6 tricks...|pg||
nt|kit: If Weinstein chooses to lead from a king he will lead clubs, since no double of 5@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: What a waste of a hand, a good relay pair could use 11 rounds of bidding to get to the same contract.|pg||
nt|kit: But the passive lead reasonable, and now declarer takes them all|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he allows Bocchi to have led from K10x.  He must have seen it before.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can duck this as well and defenders still need to defend carefull to ge all their trics.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rensph:  looks like some excellent slams available for NS here, as long as N plays|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  3NT + 1 is quite a nice result from the other table|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rensph:  south will show a strong hand with diamonds which should get north excited enough to try for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: Nice tool, 3@D by lauria would be very good overcall in @S, perhaps more|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rhelle:  1NT = relay|pg||
nt|brolucius: East perhaps hopes to be able to redbi 3@D, to show that hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  I'm not sure I agree with 5@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@c = @c|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|gracelin: Wonder how 6C was made at closed room.  Seems the bad break in spades will sink it.  SA and spade will surely beat it.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rensph:  They did manage to avoid 6@D but I believe south could've cuebid over 4@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Muller is known for his slow play |pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@d = 3-1-5-4 exacty|pg||
nt|kit: 2@D by Bobby would not be natural -- however, 2@S shows invite values|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: What would he bid with 7-8 and a doubleton spade?|pg||
nt|kit: he would bid 2@H, transfer to 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see. It is good to have such accurate methods.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS conducted a Gazzilli auction here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C is normal response to forcing 1NT or any 16-17 up hand, 2D is 8 p and GF|pg||
pc|hT|nt|boedhy:  and 40 minutes for 6 boards is not much...|pg||
nt|brolucius: For the past few weeks I have been doing voice commentary instead of tap-in commentary. It is good to see that I can still type OK. |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|boedhy:  luckly easy 3nt..|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: East (Sementa) lead @sA - but then in trick 2 @DA :(:(|pg||
nt|famus: cud b a swing|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't blame him.  He was looking at his 2 Aces, and these Chinese did bid slam off 2 Aces before.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: so 11 to 14 IMP on way for China|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|famus: may be--cant say till it ends|pg||
nt|gracelin: As north has not shown his 6th spade here, East may not find the killing defense.  However, without cashing SA, I thk 6C is still in trouble.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he has shown 6sp and 4H already|pg||
nt|pelu: will S pass to 4@s?|pg||
nt|gracelin: don;t thk North will ass, South has shown 8+|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: The advantage of doing the tap-in commentary is that you have a split second to check whether your comment is completely stupid before you press enter.|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but then when you do say something stupid you look so bad :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Against that, some duff comment is preserved for posterity on the VuGraph web-sites. If you say something clueless, no-one records it and you can hope that the spectators thought ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: you were joking.  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|boedhy:  still @h stop|pg||
nt|gracelin: pass|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rensph:  North might very well have bid 6NT after discovering @SA and the lack of a club stopper in partner's hand|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: talking about system|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|kareno: Yes he had a winkle|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@D better than double on that shape.|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Stayman|nt|athene: i double versace passed 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt :)|pg||
nt|rensph:  W might be tempted to bid a thin game here, but it's NV so might very well pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: So much for 3nt by n...|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C a little scary -- Weinstein thinks opponents might have a slam.|pg||
nt|pelu: but a problem for NS that they never found their 5-3 fit in @c|pg||
nt|lechcold: transfer na kolor wroga to Stayman|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: but many would just bid 3nt rather than use stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: 5@D was a sensible option by North. Some would bid 5@C, claiming that they couldn't be any better for a passed hand. But South only made a simple overcall.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rensph:  Creative approach by W - had east shown a 5card major he'd be ok with that, too|pg||
mc|9|nt|gracelin: They may end up in 2S with the Gazzilli.|pg||
pg||
qx|c29|st||md|3SHDC,SHDC,SHDC,SHDC|sv|b|nt|brolucius: Yes, good defence.  did not want to be caught giving a ruff-and-discard on the second round of spades|pg||
nt|athene: after 1@S - 1NT, how many clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: i bet he bids just two|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rhelle:  2@c = 11-15, 6+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS do play 1@S - 2@D as hears|pg||
nt|rensph:  other table reached 3N and made it, so 7 imps to South Africa|pg||
mb|4S|nt|boedhy:  south will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|athene: hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Two - no need to preempt with a solid opening bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China has another chance here, 6S is cold|pg||
nt|fluffy: not your everyday vulnerable preempt|pg||
nt|fluffy: 6@s is far from cold requiers a good guess i ntrumps or in the minors|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Italy they say Vulnerability is for children and Bocchi is no children.|pg||
nt|fluffy: normally you should gues trumps, but you are not entry rich to dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but they won't use the bid with this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2NT = balanced|pg||
nt|kit: This is as flat a 4@H hand as you will find, it sppears.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|fluffy: aat least with the club opening he will guess clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Shi didnt dare to cue 4@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess Lian will move on|pg||
nt|pelu: but Lian still looking for slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he had taken a bid but took it back|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rhelle:  (no singleton or void)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rensph:  6@S makes on the rather fortunate heart position here, but they'll likely end up in 4@S|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  2227 balanced tehese days :)|pg||
nt|athene: wow, only 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to bid a few more than that after partner doubles clubs for takeout|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|boedhy:  well maybe south should go for 3nt then ?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sort of wrongsided it now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could it be slam looking form south...|pg||
nt|kareno: I also play that double as takeout.  And they have a light opening style with the forcing club system.|pg||
nt|rensph:  wouldn't want to get anywhere near 6@S usually|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: USA 1 took a big lead when China went down in 4@S rather than the 3nt on bd 25.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You remember the deal where Levin upgraded a 17-count to 18, reaching 3NT opposite 7? China played that deal in 4@S, on a 5-3 fit and went one down. So, Kit's advice on the deal, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that West should not seek a 5-3 spade fit proved to be good advice.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they are there, I am quite sure Shi will take 12 tricks.  He is the best player in the team and reach semi final in BB in 2009.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fluffy: if declarer missguesses trumps he will need to find @dQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: or squeeze south in the reds|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a difficult task|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S = 2Aces + @SQ - Lian exp @sAKQ :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he even has time to establish a long Heart|pg||
nt|famus: natural for him to play !j--but if he opts to play a small @s--the play ends at trick 2|pg||
nt|famus: @sj|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the vugraph schedule so you can plan your days and weeks      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|pelu: he know that N is short in @S, so he could play @S6|pg||
nt|famus: that wud end the thrill!!:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has so many entry to dummy, so I thk to take CA and play small spade to finesse S10 is the right play|pg||
nt|fluffy: Imaine for example playing a low spade and south ducking @sK9xx he might lock you in dummy with a heart and you have no way back to hand except destoying you chances of stablishing ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: this will be the 3. slam-swing in the match - the first 2 gave China 25 IMP and prob 12 more here|pg||
nt|gracelin: China should be proud of themself in outbidding the Italians in 3 slams in one set.  If Shi makes this.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: but one of the slam only maded on a defensiv error|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: various ways to come to nine tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: take a ruffing finesse in spades is one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|boedhy:  offcourse it was 50% but south has a very strong hand imo|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi must be thinking harder than we do except he is not looking at all 4 hands.  I am sure the line he chooses is the best one.|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the page for the result fromthe 3 events     http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|famus: so the Chinese wud b the first to put a dent in this Italian Juggernaut--They've rolled over evry other opponent mercilessly, and i dare say artfully till now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rensph:  pointed out to me that it's not 12 tricks if E leads a club through, so S would have to play the hand in order to succeed. :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|kareno: And all he needs are eight :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: now overruff, diamond shift kills the dummy entry|pg||
nt|gracelin: now he need to guess DQ for his slam.  Declarer may try Heart 3-3 first,|pg||
nt|pelu: did he realy need to play @SJ?|pg||
nt|famus: so he has to play on the red suit squeeze but i think must surrender a @S NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: I say no, since he as so many reentries to dummy|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: so only 8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s6|nt|famus: to keep trump control and check out @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: take @S10 and play @DJ - he has a ruffing finess later in @c|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is to eatablish his club trick first|pg||
nt|pelu: my bet: he will make :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|gracelin: H to dummy, run CQ, covered, ruff|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south overruff and play Heart, dummy wns, cash CJ, and ruff Heart back, the last trump will double squeeze NS|pg||
nt|fokal: true|pg||
nt|gracelin: and south cannot discard H here.  Best for im is to discard a D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: hm|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: Madala did just that.|pg||
nt|fokal: E can't afford to play a trump now|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs offered my free cofeee if making - I look forward - he will make!|pg||
nt|fokal: since he doesn't know what to discard from dummy|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d8|mc|10|pg||
qx|c30|st||md|4SHDC,SHDC,SHDC,SHDC|sv|o|nt|boedhy:  I meant North |pg||
nt|famus: wd China|pg||
nt|pelu: so S has to discard a @h, but then again @D to K, @H-ruff and S can be endplayed on @s9|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south doubles 1@S and then north bids 1nt, i suppose|pg||
nt|gracelin: I have predicted Shi will make this slam.  Glad he didn't let me down.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|rhelle:  so far NS have 12 plus scores - they will be happy|pg||
nt|gracelin: at this Vul. 2D shows 4S and 5+ minor with 5-11 pts|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2N|an|GF|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: some might be tempted to double this with north but he does not have that great a hand|pg||
nt|athene: you either need a shortage so you can get some ruffs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|boedhy:  yes they will be pretty confident about there list|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only board 9 is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  It was bid and made at most tables|pg||
nt|athene: or you need such good trumps you just make them by force|pg||
nt|kareno: Nanev very close to a second double.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention that 2@C on a passed hand should show a sound raise in partner's major was banned for years by the English Bridge Union.  They thought it allowed players to psyche ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in 3rd seat....|pg||
nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
nt|athene: he really has not got that much defence|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case, north might sit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is no doubt what he is thinking about.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  only worry of declarer here is to avoid losing 2 spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: with the knowledge of south's 4-cad spade, declarer can take deep finesse there to get 4S, 1H, 2C and 2D.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|kit: Weinstein worried about a club ruff, so may play two top spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 37 IMP for China on 3 slams !|pg||
nt|gracelin: as there are only 2 entries to dummy, he could cash SA first to see what's north singleton, when the S7 shown, he know to double hook S10 and SQ|pg||
nt|fokal: he can evan afford to cash the @s As|pg||
nt|famus: this shud b a swing back to Italy if @s dont go to deep fin|pg||
nt|fokal: *even|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: in 4@s, 4 players made, 10 players went down|pg||
nt|fluffy: making 3NT is for sure a supperb score|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Italian declarer must be among the 4 that make|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer lacks the entries for finesse south for Q107x, so he must hope north hold one of the Q, 10, or 7.  So cas SA and take the double hook|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer can fleely cash @sA now right?|pg||
nt|famus: has to beware of entries to play @s twice- but also needs to check the hand---Declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||

nt|brolucius: You can see how hopeless it would have been for North to 'cover an honour with an honour'. |pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|kit: Now diamond shift and he is down.|pg||
nt|kit: Problem was he couldn't go up ace of hearts due to no entry to the club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South may hope that North started with @CKQJ.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: If North had that in clubs, North would have cashed another club at least|pg||

nt|gracelin: EW can make 3H, so 2S -1 or -2 is no big deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: the lead guesses diamonds for declarer, and now defeating 2@s will require a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|boedhy:  well stopped|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs behave but not much else.  Good lead - actually Bridge World has an article this month about the benefits of major suit leads against notrumps - and their general success.|pg||
nt|athene: versace wondering whether to start clubs with small towards the ten i suppose|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the session. I would like to thank Dirk, our splendid VG operator. Excellent session and many thanks!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|boedhy:  4nt quantitative|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, unless you're in 6NT and you get the wrong lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  could be 12 tricks played from East|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|rensph:  3@C puppet stayman here, little to the play in 4@S> Declarer will draw trumps and then requires the @HK to be onside|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lechcold: Grzegorz nie powinien tak siê emocjonowaæ swoimi walorami w czerwonych kolorach|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rensph:  he might be able to play for a throw-in|pg||
nt|kamyk: w sierpniu 80 Rosiewicz piewa³: "Bulgarija,Bulgarija, u Polijaka awarija"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Also, many thanks to Kit and Joe, my fellow commentators. We were awarded a fair bunch of boards - neither excellent, nor hopelessly boring - somewhere in between.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rensph:  should the throw-in fail (If S holds the 3rd spade) he can still finesse the hearts himself|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|c32|st||md|2SHDC,SHDC,SHDC,SHDC|sv|e|nt|rensph:  ducking that spade looked a little odd|pg||
nt|pelu: as so often - many partscore swings for Italy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: no trudno..teraz ³adny szlemiczek|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|boedhy:  throwing imps like candy..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board, we start again at 13.45|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: that is in 1 hour|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes do you know there agreements|pg||
nt|rhelle:  they play dstructive preempts this vul(doesn't everybody?)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  what is the range|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but the temptation to bid 6@c must be strong|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt overcall perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: would be interesting to see how lauria-versace handle such interference|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like a normal 4H hand on this last deal of the set.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rhelle:  getting to 6@d now is too hard, I think|pg||
nt|rensph:  Even if spades break 4-1 taking the ace and returning a spade works equally well|pg||
nt|antoniz: bardzo trudny po otwarcie przeciwnika|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kareno: So many thanks to Bob Drijver our excellent Operator.  To the specs for their wit and wisdom.  To Bill Frisby for his contributions and, of course, to WBF for allowing us to watch ...|pg||
nt|kareno: their marvelous production of the world championships.|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphznt: bocchi pointing out 3H makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  4@d may be an artificial slam try in @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will bid 5@c now expecting @h points|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally, this double shows a desire to penalize opps, but my guess is EW just use it to show some values|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The next session starts in around 1 hours and 10 minutes. It will be the last session of the day.|pg||
nt|kit: This time it is right to play the 5-3 major-suit fit|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even promising spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board for the day, back tomorrow at 10.30 Paris time|pg||
mb|5C|nt|boedhy:  still liking his hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite this loss of Italy they still do lead the Round Robin pack after round 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  in this layout it all mattered very little, had north held the @HK it would've been a very effective @SQ|pg||
nt|famus: i rate them favourite to win|pg||
nt|gracelin: some care is needed here.  But I am confident Shi will also bring this home.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: LIAN already left the table|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a well educated quess Famus±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: the next match will start in 40 minutes from now.  Tks all for watching and hope you have enjoyed some great hands.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will also like to thank Felipe, our most capable operator who explained many bidding sequences to us.|pg||
nt|pelu: a way to play is @cA - @H to Q, @hA and then 4x@D discard @s, then @C AND MAKING 11|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks tough for E )DD very easy'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he is afraid for @H loss @C@C and @SA for down 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer want to cash HA first as a safety play(he could afford t lose one trump), but here the threat for club overruff made that play not totally safe.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and very afraid for ducking this IF S 6 card @C|pg||
nt|famus: playing @hA is sure wau to -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7 card|pg||
nt|famus: 6 cards he has so needs to duck|pg||
nt|gracelin: with a 7-card club suit at this Vul. south may have bid more.  so duck the first club then take trump finesse maybe a good way.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope he does not go for the line @CA @HA x@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: dojd¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba...|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|boedhy:  now pass finally|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good sequence - 5@c is again 50% at best|pg||
nt|boedhy:  slam again 50% or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North: you guys have a bit of a @h fit|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, you'd better reserve your seats for the entire tournament - there is much wonderful bridge coming up!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: :(|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|rensph:  3N is made on a heart lead and continuation here, but if defenders set up a diamond trick early on declarer will still have to find the @SQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  I'm also informed that lauria made 4@S on this hand|pg||
nt|rensph:  3NT, sorry|pg||
nt|jacksond: if plays donde for spade queen he makes quite easily|pg||
nt|rensph:  sorry, 3N making with clubs 3-3|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|brolucius: North realised that his partner must have had some purpose in bidding 2@C checkback. When it turned out that he was not looking for four hearts, he knew that he must have been ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: looking for a 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@C Krzysztof potraktowa³ jako normalny cue-bid|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|boedhy:  and offcourse this one is down on @s lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  thinking about it, 6@c is down on a @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: 10 easy tricks with spades splitting, but only 8 in notrump|pg||
nt|brolucius: if you want to listen to Voice Commentary, you should go directly to website: http://www.bridgebase.com/|pg||
pc|dA|nt|famus: yes--too tired--as pointed out by informed kibtz-- taking @H  A wud need to squeeze|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bye for now|pg||
nt|kareno: So that's it and Italy will get most or all of the VPs for this match.  Well done!!|pg||
nt|rensph:  lets see how declarer handles 4@S here though|pg||
nt|gracelin: He play Hear to break 2-2 or a singleton honor drops.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pity|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy recovered 19 mps in last 2 boards for a tied match.  Bye all|pg||
nt|famus: so a well deserved 1 imp:) thnks all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still China wins    wddddddddd±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.  They tied with both Sweden and Italy today|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±' ±'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i try to smile but fail............±)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ty everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: see you soon|pg||
nt|lechcold: przyda³oby siê 4N jako cue-ogólny|pg||
mc|13|nt|antoniz: po kontrze w 3tr,chyba lepsze 4tr|pg||
