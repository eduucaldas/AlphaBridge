nt|vugraphznv: 6 @c .....|pg||
nt|lml: West will likely open a weak 2 in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would open 2@C with east's hand for sure|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: then south might try 3@C maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: E hand is 3 loosers|pg||

mb|1D|an|transfer for hearts|mb|1S|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||
nt|lml: a matter of style|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: north might have intended 4@C to say "you can save in 5@C if you like"|pg||

nt|athene: bocchi-madala play quite an active game so i would not be surprised if bocchi bids 5@C in that same position|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ron_sc2002: 5@C bid would win 4 imps and maybe more if EW will bid to the 5 level|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|stayman|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lml: in the Open Room they did start with a weak 2 using multi ... that may have made it a bit harder|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an| |nt|ron_sc2002: 2@C is both majors by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: duboin giving his partner quite a bit of leeway for 2@C at favourable|pg||

nt|lml: lots of tricks here|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|lml: more than 13|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: but his @DQJ are not going to be much use facing shortage|pg||
mb|3H|an| |mb|p|nt|lml: with 33 HCP most pairs should reach a slam somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: maybe all|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lml: needing a club finesse you really dont want to be in the grand but ...|pg||
mb|4N|an| |mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|lml: so south knows they are off the @CQ from the keycard response|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: as expected, bocchi bid 5@C and reaped a large reward|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
