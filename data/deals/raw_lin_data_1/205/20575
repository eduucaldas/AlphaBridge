nt|vugraphzns: BUL 29   POL 22|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: result from closed room: South 5@d making 13 tricks .. score 440|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|vugraphzns: so far exactly same bidding as in the closed room|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 3@c bid is helpful for Bulgaria I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: in the Closed room Narkiewicz made a DBL with the N hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|nt|star6ija: but if W pass, what is the option for N...pass?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@S/@D both contracts makeable.|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: Aronov is doing some thinking here|pg||
nt|star6ija: 440 is the result in the CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: 5@D making all 13 tricks = 440|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzns: Aronov puts his cards down|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: on the table |pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@c is maybe option Aronov considering now|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: and is shaking his head --- lets see his bid :)|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: takes up the cards again -- but still no bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: staring intensively at the bidding tray |pg||
nt|vugraphzns: picks a bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: and it is .........|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: a PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: Ace of @d is a card that insures 5th level...he is thinking what can go wrong if partner has 2 major Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: but this missed slam still give Bulgaria a few imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: Bulgaria 30 .. Poland 22 or something like that|pg||
