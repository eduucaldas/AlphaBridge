pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|ian111:  going for the other 7 card fit|pg||
nt|mango joe: when that doesnt work he will have to play on @D break|pg||

nt|ian111:  if he thought the D were 3-3 he could have relied on the long D for his 10th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  big double fit here for NS but only 10 tricks in 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the save in 5@c is likely which might push NS to 5@h|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mango joe: Its the only comparison we have so far. Kibs can check comparisons by clicking on MOVIE at the bottom of your screen|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: Asimple 4@H here... tough to reach?!?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: and he played it very fast ...|pg||
nt|ian111:  board 17 flat - but I preferred Spear's line|pg||
nt|mrdct:  gill might splinter in @h if available|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ian111:  a C at trick 2|pg||
nt|mrdct:  or introduce a clever psyche with a view to retreating to @c later|pg||
nt|mango joe: good result for Australia in closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: likely collect 2@H and then South will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|mango joe:  West cud hv made a negative X one wud hv thought|pg||
nt|mrdct:  as south, i like to keep 2@H as a natural bid in this auction|pg||
nt|mrdct:  north might suspect west has psyched now!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  yes - X seems normal|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4@H is a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 3@D now may get them there...|pg||
nt|figo: that he does almost always|pg||
nt|ian111:  4H very close|pg||
nt|mrdct:  actually - undo all of those comments - i believe EW play transfer over their 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mrdct:  1@h will just be showing 4+ @s|pg||
nt|mango joe: looks like only 89 tricks on likely @H lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct:  whilst NS can be held to 10 tricks, that depends of a defence of two black aces at tricks 1 & 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@H is 4 +@S|pg||
nt|mango joe: 8 lol|pg||
pc|hT|nt|viren169: or 4@H as you say!|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D for us mere mortals!|pg||

nt|ian111:  e/w recovered to bif 4H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mango joe: easy to miss slam here which needs either @Cs to come in or @S 3-3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ian111:  bid |pg||
nt|ian111:  N/S take the red save - might go -2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|garnetts: sorry caps lock  try A@C and three rounds of @D s|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure even I could go down!|pg||
nt|mango joe: a good vul sacrifice if he gets @S right|pg||
nt|mango joe: E will have to find 4 discards on the run of @cx and may have to bare his K@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct:  this looks to be one or two down - so a lost opportunity for australia|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west has perhaps already shown his hand with his 1@S bid and ought to have left the 5-level decision to compete to east|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ian111:  as so often - no one able to double|pg||
nt|mango joe: so Australia draws level|pg||
pc|d6|nt|viren169: 5 @H + 3@S + 2 ruffs = 10 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: west is pondering|pg||

nt|vicky888:  Hello all, hi mahesh :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Vicky|pg||
nt|mango joe: a 2@C opening in precision often has a  card major as it did in this case at the other table|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4 card major|pg||
nt|mrdct:  4@h for EW looks good here|pg||
nt|mango joe: he had a chance to test the @S and then perhaps guess if E had Kx or W had 10x @H|pg||
nt|mango joe: once @S didnt break|pg||
nt|mango joe: cards lie nicely for E/W here|pg||
nt|mango joe: good duck of @H by Arun|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|paulg:  do you transfer to clubs with the South hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: we have a strong club |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: today the drinks are on the house ...by the organisers|pg||
nt|viren169: and one for you, no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is routine now |pg||
nt|vicky888:  Amazing start for Hemant Jalan|pg||
mb|d|nt|mango joe: easy 3NT here for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: 6@C and 6NT both make though very unlikely to be bid|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: We are in the wrong place!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: o|pg||
nt|vicky888:  light 3rd seat opening will need to take out to 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: still 11 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and I also will act as W now - non vulnerable|pg||
nt|mango joe: wonder what 2@S is, its certainly not weak but 9 tricks seems to be the limit here with 2 trump losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it is interesting, as it has to play three tricks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: That is a nice touch--wish they would do that here too  --well done|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|paulg:  Sandy Duncan is one of the most conservative bidders that I know ... a very solid and sound player|pg||
nt|mrdct:  stiff @cA is a little bit hard to evaluate - but west has nothing more to say than 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  @s lead best for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@sx pass interesting other room|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct:  the double of 4@c might have meant "don't lead a @c"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mango joe: another good board for Poddar|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|viren169: looks like a strong 1@C auction to 4@H here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure what 2@S was meant to achieve--3@H looked better--stronger than a direct 4@H |pg||
nt|viren169: just showing 4@S on the way - I guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: 11 tricks--next |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: let @cK win|pg||
nt|paulg:  is Duncan still thinking?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks more like a deadlock:)|pg||

mb|d|nt|mango joe: esp in the last round of the round robin|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mango joe: qualified for the semis by the skin of their teeth |pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: I have to admit I'm in the 1N-3N camp.|pg||
nt|garnetts: with AQxxx in a minor it will be 5 tricks a lot of the time and you should bid 3NT in my view because partner will never know that|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|garnetts: oddly enough 2-1 scores here because it will start either with 1@D or 1@C and the 1NT response will show up to a about 11 and clubs which will shut east up for the right reasons |pg||
nt|suketbombi: Mahesh can we have the udate on scores?|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: What would you have bid David with East's hand?|pg||

nt|mango joe: 3@S 4@H + 1@D shud be easy|pg||

pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: NS have now passed the best contract 3nt|pg||

pc|c3|nt|garnetts: They have also pinpointed the defence too --no heart control |pg||
nt|viren169: North was hoping they went on!|pg||
nt|garnetts: North should lead the A@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: this will clear things up for him|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: north asking east....thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: Not an easy lead...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|suketbombi: have a great party thx for the brodcast and Good luck for the taj trip see you on Friday|pg||

nt|mango joe: can he find out about Q@S?|pg||
nt|mango joe: he cant bid 7 with any surety|pg||
nt|mango joe: he knows abut K@D A@C and Q to four @hs|pg||
nt|mango joe: and he knows that N will have a bit more for his opening |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: hoping that partner has @sq also|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes but it will be on a hope rather than certainty|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: 8-card suits on S as well as N|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  perhaps it went fast at the end and he did not pitch all his diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if 3NT is a 4-level minor pre-empt, or a flawed solid suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: in the old days it was a running suit, but time has changed.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: hemant jalan  , leads alpha    75-0|pg||

nt|ian111:  both sides can make 10 tricks in a minor|pg||
nt|ian111:  which final ?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Hemant or Scotland?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Commonwealth Games Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzat:  Hemant Jalan leads Alpha by 75-0:   Arun Jain leads Magic Eyes( thailand) by 22:   Australia leads Formidables 51-19|pg||
nt|ian111:  Hemant |pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: This is a board, wher you have to choose betwenn 5 ot 7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ian111:  it was close with about 8 boards to play, but ended up over 40 to Hemant|pg||
nt|mango joe: 2@H shows less than 4 points normally, its the weakest response|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|paulg:  if North would bypass a 4-card diamond suit to bid 1NT, as many would, then pass is an option that would not work out well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  but Duncan-Gordon are pretty old-school and so retreating to clubs looks sensible|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

nt|mrdct:  gill might ruff this to lead a @c through|pg||

mb|p|nt|mango joe: 40 imps needed in 3 boards, havent seen that before|pg||

pc|s5|nt|mrdct:  this will be 1 or 2 down i think|pg||

nt|mango joe: E/W close to slam and in fact it makes due to lucky @S position|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: sorry for undo|pg||
nt|mango joe: np Mahesh|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: they playing on? i thought it was 12 X 3|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mango joe: Mahesh?|pg||
nt|ian111:  i thought so too|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes  12 x 3 |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: this set started with 15 as 1st|pg||
nt|mango joe: but this is 13th board|pg||
nt|ian111:  so why are we playing bd 25?|pg||
nt|mango joe: ah ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 15-  26|pg||
nt|mango joe: ok thanks|pg||
nt|ian111:  ah yes - 13/14 removed|pg||
nt|ian111:  looks like 4S -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  31 imps in 2 boards looks unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  needs a H guess and C finesse|pg||
nt|ian111:  could try 3NT and hope to avoid a H lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s on E or do you show a 2-suiter? |pg||
nt|paulg:  a slam swing on board 25 has given Hemant Jalan some breathing room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i show two-suiters these days|pg||
nt|mrdct:  pretty much need two double game swings|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  in my system, it would be 3@c to show non-strong spades and clubs|pg||
nt|mango joe: puppet|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  Duncan's bid depends on their methods after a reverse ... some play 2NT as artificial (with weak hands)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now E? do you regret only 1@s?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yet to get a push board|pg||
nt|ian111:  not easy to bid the thin but good 5C|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|mrdct:  it would take a horrible defence to let NS make 5@d here - not that they are at all likley to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: arun jain 117- magic eyes 78|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  3NT probably suggests a weak club stop|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Gordon has nowhere to go .. he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: usually the weaker hand bids the major he doesnt have |pg||
nt|ian111:  4S by E might make on CJ lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  are the results on the web anywhere?|pg||
nt|mango joe: 9 top tricks now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzat: see hcl website|pg||
nt|mrdct:  both 5@c and 3NT depend on the @s hook|pg||
pc|c9|nt|paulg:  this should be beaten on a club lead, as long as West does not cover the @sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  given West's poor spade intermediates, this should be easy to avoid|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|paulg:  this will play well with the doubleton club with north and the @d10 preventing a force|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c is much easier than 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Ian|pg||
nt|andybe: good lead but will not gain any imps|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ian111:  hi |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|paulg:  not an easy lead for East to read, although to beat the contract he has little choice about playing West for an honour|pg||
nt|paulg:  or playing West for 98xx|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mango joe: at least the @H guess was easier|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the HCL website only seems to have hte results up to round 9 of the swiss|pg||
nt|mango joe: he will know Q@S and a key card is missing so will stop in 5 probably|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzat: Aus vs Ind 1 for the silver and bronze medal.....Scotland have won the Gold Medal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Scotland has already won the Gold medal as the top national team in the event|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|vugraphzat: 2nd 3rd place|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mango joe: all to no avail though|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1 to 12 boards ...than 15 to 26|pg||
nt|ian111:  4S made at the other table|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ian111:  2h might struggle too|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ian111:  S tried a small C at trick 2 after a H lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think bbo timetable was wrong - this started exactly one hour afer the advertised start time|pg||
nt|mrdct:  when is the restart?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mango joe: he will have no choice but to get @Ss right so i predict a make|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s4|pc|cT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ian111:  i watched murdoch spears this morning and they were tired|pg||
nt|mango joe: so Poddars lead looking more unassailable now|pg||
nt|ian111:  it's been a long 10 days|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  as the cards lie, 5@d makes but tough to find when South says some of his values are in clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ian111:  but he's got enough power in trumpd|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cannot se any way to take 8 tricks |pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|nt|mango joe: have they reduced the boards for semis & final as well?|pg||
nt|mrdct:  of course in 5@c @s finesse not required if you can setup a long @h trick|pg||
nt|mango joe: maybe thats why they started later|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: and 10 tricks in @c|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mango joe: now @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  once you've decided to overcall 1@s I think it's pretty impossible to play in clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  and if 2@d is Michaels and 2NT the lowest two suits, perhaps he had no option but to overcall 1@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, you should therefore show a 2-suiter on lowest level|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: next vugraph in 5 minutes time|pg||
nt|mango joe: so 3 Indian teams in the semis|pg||
nt|mango joe: there was a problem with communicatios so only 9 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: declarer claimed 10 and accepted|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  it's a compromise that was expensive this time, but gains in simplicity|pg||
nt|mango joe: the number of good Indian teams here is really impressive|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzat: 41 imps 5 boards|pg||
nt|ian111:  particularly to Subhash - the main orgnaniser|pg||
nt|mango joe: thats that then|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2@S alerted as lead direction with @d fit|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Arun Jain 85 vs Magic eyes 53|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ian111:  looks like 3NT is difficult to make |pg||
nt|ian111:  but west is going to come under pressure|pg||

pc|s4|nt|andybe: with the spade ruff this will be down 2 for 3 imps to AJ|pg||

nt|fugitiv: good contract|pg||
nt|fugitiv: the south hand is worth alot more than 14 with the sharp cards, intermediates, and nice 5 card suit|pg||
