mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|xenya: might not be so boring on a spade lead but still makes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: They can get a spade ruff but thay can't get a club too|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|iceking: Zia might swift to @C|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but then they don't get a spade ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: same thing, 10 tricks|pg||
nt|iceking: yes same thing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and if they don't take the club trick now they won't get it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2729.html  for standings after round 7 |pg||
nt|iceking: Welland will probably play @S here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade ruff must be the only chance for the defence|pg||
nt|iceking: and give away ovetrick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It will cost a trick but it doesn't matter much with this format|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: he has @s 7 in hand (under the table) -- but has put it back several times now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and now he is "rocking" on his chair and has put his cards on the table|pg||
nt|iceking: zia could have started with x xx Jxxxxxx KJx with that its down if Zia gets his ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, @SA singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Zia is reading the Bulletin |pg||
nt|iceking: and Zia almost has that hand so Welland probably should return @S here|pg||
nt|iceking: yes sry A stiff |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: together with Madala |pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: Zia is 1 with 212 and Zorlu is 2. with 192|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: small upgrade from N?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and south might do the same|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: Auken-von Arnim  vs   Bertheau-Nyström|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe 3@S now|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, they play 15-17, but the 5c is treated as 1 extra|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: We will get names up soon|pg||

nt|peacokk: A squeeze |pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: are the norwegians awake enough to bid this slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Probably not the best line to play anyhow|pg||
nt|peacokk: in the long run|pg||
nt|tez: zorlu assael have 9 card @h but very bad split|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: S hand, despite the 14 count, is too slow. Passing 3d is very reasonable |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Roland. 4@d must be in no danger, so 3@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: MGrand possible - which will fail|pg||
nt|sommer: good game|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a club lead to break 4 of a major i think|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sommer: this isnt best contract|pg||
nt|sommer: still makeable|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: defence looks favoutite here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: flat hands are often disappointing|pg||
nt|sommer: if W takes the normal way in @C's, NS must hurry to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: something lower you think Povi?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Garner/Weinstein will let it through|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is ok;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is also a winner but difficult to spot|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: with the diamond finesse working 13 tricks are there|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C 4-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: it wont be bid - of course|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: 4-0|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: just a question of how many - not enormously important at this form of scoring|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sommer: got the chance there!|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry |pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: in grand u have 12 tricks by finess @cJ - but if decl start ruffing @Ds for the 13. trick he is down - only the finess for @dK will give him 13|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sommer: not easy for S to shift from KJ6|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe these guys are world champs or something:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The scoring is IMPs so big pick up possible here for HeHe|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, maybe 5@D can go down on a club lead, but East would never find that|pg||

nt|thorvald: While we wait you can have a look at board 1 from previous round, where 6 declares went down i 7 clubs. Can you spot the winning and best line on the actual layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and when Welland lead the @s 7 everything ended immediately|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: Typical Zia 3rd in hand non-vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 1N, what else :)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|iceking: seems like a standard 1nt opening to me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: 2@s = invitational with 5@ss|pg||
nt|xenya: Zia not happy |pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|iceking: he could have passed 2@C or?|pg||
nt|thorvald: With a partner that passed in the first round coldn't he pass 2@c with confidence ?|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@S also played in closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could, and telling Madala that he psyched|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure what is best|pg||

nt|iceking: i would have just have opened 3@C but this is ofcourse more fun for us|pg||
nt|thorvald: I agree with the 3@c opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play 15-17|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good evening all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: Well, 14 balanced with @SQx. I understand pass|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Welland could have started with a 2S (as a passed hand) to encourage Zia to bid more |pg||
nt|roswolf: i bet bocchi/madala wont miss out there|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S|pg||
nt|ndemirev: HIs hand was great in context |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is a match from round 6 and the last today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they're ok in 3NT, but 4@s looks likely|pg||
nt|pelu: just the opening Martens hoped to see :(:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: strong club, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  any 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=relay (I think), may be 20+|pg||
nt|peacokk: I guess they will end up in 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: can they get to 3nt by west?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: and a @c lead against 3nt hadn´t defeated if Welland had played  @cQ from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham and Raju Tolani|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: i think S should have read the @H position on the previous hand|pg||
nt|tez: need agrement here..whats dbl?t/o to @d or good @c's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and not 5@d either|pg||
nt|sommer: no chance, I guess|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe even -2 after small @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: if see LH open with both majors - u bid 2@S in S? - not me - but I am old :)|pg||
nt|sommer: could be wrong to pass too, but you are right, Peter|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sommer: in these zones, W may be very light|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: probably long suit, wekaish hand, and reasonable conclusion  |pg||
nt|mamos: standings after first two rounds of this strong tournament at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S would be second negative so 2@C shows some values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hence 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2727.html  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 1@s might not be to everyone's taste, but it has worked well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mamos: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|xenya: they found a nice spot|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sommer: yes, this will be easy - guess, it will be bid all over|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: not a hand of great interest  -- Butler style scoring I think  effectively imp Pairs    scored on 80-0 match basis|pg||
nt|mamos: ten boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: total imps across the field, two results scratched, with a cap at 40 imp  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pairs are given 40 imps so no negative scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't lose more than the 40 IMPs you have when you start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big scores in the last round:  80-0  77-3  and  71-7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: Screens are not in use|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 75 minutes to complete 10 boards|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice underlead by Bocchi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: yes but it is a misfit hand and i would therefore pass|pg||

pc|s9|nt|suketbombi:  will cash out for 120 to helness|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: unlucky, but likely to happen at all tables|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Many spectators do not understand a word when they see 1NT and I don't blame them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zia tried to mislead the opponents|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|vugraphzsg: NS playing Walsh|pg||

nt|vugraphzsg: you want to make a bet on that Magnus ?|pg||

nt|thorvald: Any count on the diamonds ? - welland did throw a club |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Madala has seen that before|pg||
nt|iceking: and when Zia shows up with the 7 i think he will get it right|pg||

nt|thorvald: Jassem played the 8 of @c in the same position in CR, doensnt seem right to me|pg||
nt|thorvald: sty 9 ofc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pekka Viitasalo: Once declarer sees how the hearts are he knows that the clubs must be as they are; otherwise the def would have taken the hearts ending East and played a club|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 3NT or 4@h|pg||
nt|sommer: at least one would be quite safe, imo|pg||
nt|xenya: E would have been squeezed on the last trump, yes|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ndemirev: 4H is a normal destination here |pg||

nt|sharkey: 4@S shud fail with E as declarer as well previous board|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: fourth highest of dummy's longest and strongest |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Lead 3.-5.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, fifth|pg||
nt|pelu: decl has to look for his 9. tricks in @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny heart position - suit is blocked. Of course South canot know that |pg||
nt|roswolf: but he may have to play for it in effect|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S misguesses @H think will fail if EW play passive defence|pg||
nt|pelu: look like !§D10 is the correct card - woring - then West easy can set up his @D - so 1. trick on @DK and then @D to 10 - to keep control|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: or not :(|pg||
nt|sommer: this may be American Stayman|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|peacokk: Well played by Nyström, just a overtrick at stake here|pg||

mb|p|nt|sommer: yes..specs ask me..I am right..it is puppet Stayman|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: this looks hopeless|pg||
nt|pelu: spects tell: 15-17 - but Helness also open on 14 - seen 2-3 times here in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|sommer: is @H 3-3 with @HA right enough?|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ndemirev: 14-30 i guess |pg||
nt|ndemirev: this lead may tip Zia to actually making it |pg||

pc|s6|nt|mamos: same sort of idea|pg||

mb|p|nt|sommer: this board belonged to EW:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but has been hijacked|pg||
nt|sommer: ..even a VERY lucky 3N dd:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: sorry West thinking?|pg||
nt|pelu: and buy the board|pg||
nt|pelu: Board 12 - final contract in OR also 2@s - but played by EW - Zia in 3. seat open 1NT on his 1-2-4-6 hand and Roy aked for major|pg||
nt|pelu: down 3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: yes   maximum   and good tricks |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and more will come!|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- this does look like a partscore hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 11 tricks in @HS for e-w and wud get to the game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: East knew keycards were missing|pg||
nt|peacokk: Nyström didn't cue a shortage in partners suit and they were at the same wavelenght, well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 2@S intervention seems very aggressive|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might make six on a non-club lead|pg||
nt|sommer: oooo|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: again just the odd overtrick to be played for|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match at this table: Weinstein-Garner vs Blakset-Røn|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=transfer to hearts, 2N=transfer break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect 3@d=re-transfer, but not sure |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt must be a supper accept and 3@D a retransfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was told 2Nt also announced a min hand in their methods|pg||
nt|suketbombi: every card working overtime and Q ( of @CS in will make 11 tricks|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ndemirev: 4S here is a desaster on the layout. |pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S by S is for me an overbid - max 3@D = invit with @s-support|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S Ok - but 4@S - I dont understrand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next round at this table (20 mins past the hour): Helness-Helgemo  vs  Martens-Jassem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2728.html  for standings after round 6 |pg||

nt|suketbombi: 5@C an excellent contract but if NV E-w will fight hard and get to 5@H wud be a bad result for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: can NS get to 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can all see 3NT is good - but South can't see the KQ to six|pg||

nt|pelu: Jelness could have passed 1NT out - now EW - with 26 HCP are close to 3NT|pg||
nt|sommer: E 1NT was too good|pg||
nt|roswolf: ttasl -TEACH THEM A SHARP LESSON|pg||
nt|sommer: he has 15..but 4-3-3-3|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mamos: lol mike i think she could|pg||
nt|sommer: 8 losers...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: although she will shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will w]be good/bad news|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: typical pairs action - pre-empt to the limit, then let the opponsnts sort it out. |pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|suketbombi: now a trump?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: too late tho|pg||
nt|mdgraham: shouldn't matter - one spade ruff brings down the queen |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Think it required an initial trump lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: can set up @DS too while @Sak intact @Ds 3-33 or JX best chance|pg||
nt|pelu: again: we have a lots of spectators I like all the comment, but I dont like that there are so many "John Do's" - pl update your profil with name and nation - many commentators dont ...|pg||

nt|sommer: that was strange:)|pg||
nt|sommer: imho|pg||
nt|pelu: only few boards to go - but in a long match that bidding will slow NS down a little :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: quite an unusual lead - @DQ must have been an option|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@d here has to be competitive, otherwise South may get frozen out with a strongish balanced hand|pg||
nt|peacokk: Not much in the play here, we all would score the 9 obvious tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as to the suit quality (and length) required, well...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sommer: Nusine was Blaksets cat..I think:)..must be dead for years now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, diamonds are 3-3 and there are the entries to set them up|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no can set up @Ds in isolation|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sommer: Tor will be unhappy with his 2@D:)..|pg||
