nt|xenya: 7N there i'm informed|pg||
nt|bt: if not 98% is in 7nt i am disappointed|pg||

nt|xenya: not sure about 4@H (what about a trump lead) but 5@C is cold|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5-card majors yes (fiannly), but not 2/1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You don't see Acol much any more, among top players that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps only the Hackett twins|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|iceking: here is another bid that in usa most would respond @S not @D|pg||

nt|iceking: not sure what 1nt was|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT may not deny Major suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|iceking: another reason why you should respond 1@S not 1@D |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: This may roll in, mind you, but it's lucky|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|iceking: are these regular pds |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume 2@S was GF showing 4-5 in @S/@D|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|iceking: and that is some overbid|pg||

nt|tomi2: then partners @DT would be the needed entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Callaghan should have inserted @DJ to create an extra entry in Dhondy's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: for @C9|pg||

pc|s2|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|othered1: pushy Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Those who were wondering about the beer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Not if you intend to pass the response|pg||
nt|othered1: That's quite a positional call (the pass) with an 11 count|pg||
nt|xenya: semi-garbage stayman?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|heyz:  now the guys with 25 HCP can start bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess, but you might have found the only partial that could go down on an ugly trump break|pg||
nt|rmb1: A good 11 count at that, but you don't know value of @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: EW reverse attitude, standard count|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: NS all upside-down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  2@h would not be my choice (of course 1@h would not have been either|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|neobas: Not a pretty contract|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rmb1: Dunn gained on  1 when OR played in 4@C+1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: this is not an easy contract|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|peachy: I doubt that he will manage 9 tricks, too much work to do|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|neobas: I think most of us would be in it still though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it begs the question of how to bid 6-4 hands, here a 2@H rebid would have worked better|pg||
nt|peachy: even so,  I expect both rooms to be there|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like down now, with no quick entry to dummy to play trumps|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|heyz:  easy for me to say from here but if you dont come in precision pairs will steal you blind|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|neobas: In my opinion with 2@D you have told about 9/13 of your cards, and with 2@H only about 6/13|pg||
nt|fabsayc: passing 3@H seems fairly clear to me|pg||
nt|peachy: there is advice existing that with bad hand 6-4, rebid the major insted of showing the 4-card minor|pg||
nt|peachy: if he is into that, then it was a guestion of was the hand bad :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Hard to find a bad 6-4 though|pg||
nt|neobas: Especially one with 13 HCP|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Thor Erik deep in thought|pg||
nt|peachy: Current standings in the league: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html|pg||

nt|heyz:  tough hand for Jeff to play|pg||
nt|henryb:  Johnson has great faith in Meckstroth. But this is abid against the LAW. His side must have only eight @s, and the opponents are likely to have only eight @h, so the three level should belong to them|pg||

nt|henryb:  On the otherhand, A10732 is not the sort of defensive holding you normally want against a one level contract|pg||

nt|fabsayc: standard London rubber bridge style|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|heyz:  need to figure out how to blackwood on this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|bt: i think 3@D is inv if decl is 10-12 balanced|pg||

nt|vugraphzrk: Its meaning is becoming evident|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: A reluctant pass by Rob|pg||

nt|tomi2: i think I would lead a loe spade too|pg||
nt|iceking: it depends like i would never lead low from QJxxx into strong nt opener |pg||
