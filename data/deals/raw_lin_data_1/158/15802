mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4@S beatable if Lauria finds diamond lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i expect a lot more bidding|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: 3@H is pass or correct|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: some of it perhaps today|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yuval10: 4@h making is a good result for France, since you have 4 losers with a @s lead and the obvious @d continuation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and double was probably takeout of spades, hence the 4@H bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rcerreto: in CR W replied 1NT and that was all|pg||
nt|Vugraph132: anyway WE have a bid Achilles heel|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rcerreto: sorry, E|pg||
nt|Vugraph132: the system|pg||
nt|Vugraph132: they had no time to discuss the system properly|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|rcerreto: in this age of thin openings 1NT response got sensibly heavier|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess Monica Cuzzi plays classic|pg||
nt|rcerreto: still, I think 2NT is forcing here|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Versace adapts|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Vugraph132: they could mistake the system... this is why Lauria told his wife: "When they alert, don't ask anything!! Ask at the end of bidding"|pg||
nt|rcerreto: then Cuzzi chose to force up to game|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my, what is 3@D?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rcerreto: can't be a real suit, he should have bid them on 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes Francesca and we should all listen to those words each time we play|pg||
nt|rcerreto: still, it looks strange not to support @c|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: specs tell me 3@D= 3 cards @c in the L/V system|pg||
nt|Vugraph132: when Versace told Lauria: "you have no chance to win", Lauria replied "I just hope you will bid many relays" :))|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow Monica cannot pass that|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I'm told that 3@d showed values with implied @c support, makes sense|pg||
nt|hedyg: but i dont see why no pass over 2NT|pg||
nt|rcerreto: because it's forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if Versace is playing 2@c gf and Cuzzi is not|pg||
nt|Vugraph132: at the end of the bidding if they ask I will add explanations|pg||
nt|hedyg: well if 2@c is gf and 2NT is conventional then you must bid 1NT with 11 hcps|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I think that not even Monica, which is a traditional bidder, plays 2NT inviting any more|pg||
nt|hedyg: do we know for sure that she bids 2@c as gf?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rcerreto: not sure but very likely, maybe Francesca will tell us later|pg||
nt|hedyg: Francesca do you have any sweets left?|pg||
nt|Vugraph132: ok 2@C was GF for Versace|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes we know that, as his bid over 2NT showed|pg||
nt|Vugraph132: 3@d was 3@C cards for Versace|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: sisi|pg||
nt|Vugraph132: for Cuzzi no|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|rcerreto: not only because it worked better :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but there maybe 1NT was forcing|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|rcerreto: surely not a strcit force since W passed|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s7|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|yuval10: hmmm this slam isn't so good, to say the least|pg||

nt|rcerreto: yes|pg||
nt|rcerreto: still, you win tricks in the same way they did 80 years ago|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rcerreto: and defense is stronger today|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|rcerreto: 2@c is "gazzilli", Lauria stretched a bit|pg||
mb|2N|an|weak with !c and !d|mb|p|nt|hedyg: he has a 6th @s|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 2NT is weak with both minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s looks better than 3@c|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 3@d|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rcerreto: you mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Lauria cannot bid @d|pg||
nt|rcerreto: no he can't|pg||
nt|hedyg: now Lauria can be 2 2 in minors , Morgantini must be worried|pg||
nt|rcerreto: S *could* bid 3@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: as long as that is a stop bid|pg||
nt|rcerreto: not obliged surely|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand 3@C has the advantage that Lauria is playing it :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would let him play for sure!|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 3@d would have the benefit to keep the bidding open|pg||
nt|rcerreto: she's in the maximum range of the weak bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: you want to keep the bidding open as S?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: she promised 5-5 max 7 hcp|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: that Q@H is not news, she needs to have those max 7 hcps in her suits|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: could Lauria not have 5 @s, 4@h and 2 2 and bid 3@C?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: well, 4@c looks plainly wrong to me|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|hedyg: the good news for Lauria is that he is not doubled|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I agree she has some extra but then why not showing the 6th @d ?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|rcerreto: partner could have 2-2 in minors|pg||
