mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzqp: All four players are @dt category national players|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c reasonable, after that i am not sure about Double, perhaps direct 2@s would work better, obviously partner has not much values|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and a @d loser still inavoidable|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think @s J then @c was another cool option, now Miguel may hold up 1st @d with his Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzqp: Capucho is thinking...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and Rodrigo may set same defense line in clubs , that may cause declarer to concede three tricks there|pg||
