mb|d|mb|p|nt|geot: Two of my personal favorites to win this tournament meets here. My other favorites between the 16 pairs are Helness - Helgemo and Weinstein - Garner,|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d on NS is a nice contract as the cards lie|pg||
nt|geot: But so many good pairs|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good morning everyone, welcome to Copenhagen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Hello Mike!|pg||

nt|mdgraham: http://www.copenhagen-bridge-invitational.com/  for the tournament website|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2723.html  for standings after round 1|pg||

nt|iceking: NS are very active and agressive |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like it, but ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Bridge is for bidders -- thats what my partner tells me -- but :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italians do it all the time and they win a lot. So it's probably the right approach|pg||
nt|iceking: its really tuff to play against them, have been murdered by these 2 often not a pleasant feeling:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|iceking: if 1nt is 12-14hcp i think Helness could invite here |pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzsg: He thought about it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S10 is a great card and the finesse is marked|pg||
pc|h3|nt|iceking: even 3nt i think is fair |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|iceking: and the T9 of @C could have some values|pg||
nt|davpro: left alone in the bidding EW would have bid 3N...that's what is good with agressive bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anybody bid 2@H with East hand instead of Dbl?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|iceking: i cant see me doing that so answear is no|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is obviously the problem with an overcall like this. Partner may play you for a suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|c6|nt|iceking: for sure |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|iceking: but i like it anyway |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo could have done it anyway, and would have, but now it was easy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Give W another point or two you may have to|pg||
nt|iceking: @S is the boss suit bid it everytime possible |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: now Helgemo shows his cards -- claiming some tricks -- it is 9|pg||

nt|mdgraham: There are eight tables in play, so the result you see from the other room is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a @c return from W and only 11 tricks.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: club or spade lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may go for a club, as only one honour card needed from partner - which, of course, he hasn't got|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: 2NT is presumably forcing - a modern-ish treatment |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s2|pc|dJ|nt|geot: Heart from west is best now|pg||
nt|geot: or ells declarer will ruff a club and lose only one club and two trumps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead seems better for the defence. looks makeable now|pg||
nt|geot: If Bjarnarson switches to a trump, declarer is in trouble unless he plays low from north|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree, but declarer can play low |pg||
nt|geot: Difficult choice for Bocchi|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|geot: wd|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: and now West can simply cash out|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: In myb  opinion the only way|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|geot: if he plays the king he need spade to be 3-3|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|geot: last cards went fast:) ofc he took the ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pelu: when partner open 2@H I like to have a very good @s-suit - sore to be decl :):):9|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|pelu: only problem @DA to the right - solved!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problem for South now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|geot: Another game that will make, three games in a row for the Italians|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice contract and 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: could 3nt be an alternative to 4@s on S?|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: Fast play, but no screens:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or as now a @d lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: classic weak two|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: EW have a super fit here -  and @SQ is well-placed|pg||
mb|3C|an|7-10 4!h or 8-10 3!h|mb|4D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so this could be at least 790|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|geot: South has some values and a partner who overcalled at the 3 level. Not unreasonable to double?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d is a good save|pg||
nt|pelu: the 3 IMP = 5@cX - 300 against 4@s|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzsh: K for count and A for att|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable indeed, but you suspect it be singularly unsuccessful |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like the double. Tell declarer how to play|pg||
