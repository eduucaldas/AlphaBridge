mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: 4 in a major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 2@D = transfer to @hs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bagman: the Raptor (or Lindqvist) 1NT promises take out with 5+ card minor and 4c major|pg||

nt|Walddk2: any bets against?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: but West will show some HCP before N has to play @D|pg||
nt|bagman: West has 15 so place to have 2 more|pg||
nt|bagman: and some of the 13 might not show up before the decision|pg||
nt|pelu: West dont know where @C10 is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Betfair offers  4:1|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: I take the bet :) 4-1 tx|pg||
nt|bagman: but Bocchi did bid the transfer; over Woolsey he did not have to|pg||
nt|bagman: maybe that indicates a working value somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, in hearts :)|pg||
nt|pelu: normal a lose bets to Roland - but I never give up :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello Geoffrey!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hej Sören!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: are the norwegians awake enough to bid this slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed thorvald|pg||
nt|thorvald: 7@D seesm with odds, needing @d 3-1 and spades 3-3 or queen double or @Ds 2-2 and @Ss 4-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|xenya: hello David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html  for standings after round 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was just looking through the VG records for this event. Several big boards yesterday.|pg||
nt|jtr: Thought you were away somewhere (exotic)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room eventually is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@c i imagine was Drury|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's singleton ace in partner's suit is not a good omen for bidding on.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes 7@d is a nice contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: My co-commentators for this match are Mike Graham and Thorvald Aagaard|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|roswolf: first prize is $9500|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi Ralf|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Probably not the best line to play anyhow|pg||
nt|peacokk: in the long run|pg||
nt|tez: zorlu assael have 9 card @h but very bad split|pg||
nt|roswolf: 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards. This is a match from round 12. Format is IMP-scoring.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he Geoffrey!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ndemirev: S hand, despite the 14 count, is too slow. Passing 3d is very reasonable |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Roland. 4@d must be in no danger, so 3@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: MGrand possible - which will fail|pg||
nt|sommer: good game|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a club lead to break 4 of a major i think|pg||
nt|thorvald: An easy game here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what a South hand!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and I like this bidding!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H either natural or any hand that might want to use relays|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so far on the right hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sommer: this isnt best contract|pg||
nt|sommer: still makeable|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, 3NT much better|pg||
nt|roswolf: and duly reached|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS SHOULD BE BID these are world champs but natural methods are not best suited to this hand - i typed this without sight of north's bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: honestly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2734.html  for standings after round 12 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there seems to be a lot of ace-underleading going on today |pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: defence looks favoutite here|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia downgraded his @ss to 4 cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, Drury, you think.|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice to have 7 in case partner forgets:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: You are right|pg||
nt|andyv:  and that link seems to have a problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  (or I typed it wrong)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: even i could make this one|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: flat hands are often disappointing|pg||
nt|sommer: if W takes the normal way in @C's, NS must hurry to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: something lower you think Povi?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Garner/Weinstein will let it through|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is ok;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is also a winner but difficult to spot|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger and for standings after round 11 go to http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2733.html|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: with the diamond finesse working 13 tricks are there|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C 4-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: it wont be bid - of course|pg||
nt|jtr: Happens|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: 4-0|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some pairs use Safe Drury.|pg||
nt|jtr: You are Mrs Bird perhaps?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade support, with clubs... just in case.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, but my wife is. Are you feeling OK?|pg||
nt|jtr: Some work sorting this one out|pg||
nt|thorvald: Any suggestions of how to play this ?|pg||
nt|jtr: You and sorry:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: But anyway nice to see some of the local players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it doesn't look a huge test|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just a question of how many - not enormously important at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|roswolf: My co-commentators for this match are Gabor Szots and Thorvald Aagaard.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: no goals scored yet though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, there was an own goal|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cost a game swing - 4@H let through with four top losers|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sommer: got the chance there!|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry |pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: in grand u have 12 tricks by finess @cJ - but if decl start ruffing @Ds for the 13. trick he is down - only the finess for @dK will give him 13|pg||
nt|jtr: Tried to steal a @s trick|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still playing to get as many tricks as possible, i think he will play clubs next |pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is the most frigid of grands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D i smaybe the only slam here that does not make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sommer: not easy for S to shift from KJ6|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe these guys are world champs or something:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The scoring is IMPs so big pick up possible here for HeHe|pg||
nt|thorvald: on a heart continuation that is|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, his entries are getting tangled now|pg||
nt|jtr: The @d is quite effective in that regard|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, might be tricky|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|thorvald: he can afford 3 spade loosers, but its getting messy |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jack Oest|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: as a spec observes 2nt- 7nt may be a sequence for us mere mortals|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Auken ask about the bidding and while Bertheau answer, Nyström takes pd cards and claim...|pg||
nt|thorvald: Yes, that is a practical sequence :-)|pg||
nt|cicus: sure. and I bet some pairs will bid it that way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a nice lead as he knows the void on S|pg||
nt|joest: hello all|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Jack!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Well, maybe 5@D can go down on a club lead, but East would never find that|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt and 5@d was makeble..5@c beats only @c lead (may be)|pg||
nt|xenya: also difficult to defend though|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|jtr: Good cash|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brolucius: West did not go in with the @HK because (a) it would assist declarer in developing his second suit, and (b) he might have had a Q-10 guess there.|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he might just lose 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Bocchi: Clubs are good:)|pg||

nt|jtr: Looks normal|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jtr: Works if the ruff is from Hx too i think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Swedes must do much wrong in the last round to lose it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E can place 4-6 in @s and @d now|pg||
nt|joest: now Brogeland just needs to cover the club to hold down the overtrick|pg||

nt|roswolf: expect west to be imaginative here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: good evening all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Happy days...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Well, 14 balanced with @SQx. I understand pass|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Welland could have started with a 2S (as a passed hand) to encourage Zia to bid more |pg||
nt|roswolf: i bet bocchi/madala wont miss out there|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now the fun may start|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is the sort of west hand where transfers are good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - stick the overcalle ron lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jtr: And its subsequent forms|pg||
nt|thorvald: http://www2.bridge.dk/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2fFiles%2fFiler%2fDivisionsturneringer+2010-2011%2f1.+division%2f11-Bjarnarson-Askgaard.pdf is CC for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S=?|pg||
nt|roswolf: THX|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|roswolf: some may have bid a fit-jump as west|pg||
nt|thorvald: 5@D looks like a possible contract, and it even looks like a winner|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cAJ on E will make 5@d easy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: expensive!|pg||
nt|roswolf: north puts his head on the block|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S|pg||
nt|ndemirev: HIs hand was great in context |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is a match from round 6 and the last today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they're ok in 3NT, but 4@s looks likely|pg||
nt|pelu: just the opening Martens hoped to see :(:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
nt|thorvald: I wouldnt have done that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: blimey, where will this end|pg||
nt|roswolf: much blood should flow|pg||
nt|pelu: blood on the table :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 0.001 to slow|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: strong club, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  any 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=relay (I think), may be 20+|pg||
nt|peacokk: I guess they will end up in 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: The @c opening works well here lead wise|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: I had to improvise a lead. BBO doesn't accept claim before lead:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: the save would be expensive|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: can they get to 3nt by west?|pg||
nt|jtr: Or could have:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like 4@H to me depends on reading the @h right - or wrong because the right solution is the antipercentage one|pg||
nt|thorvald: This wasnt the right contract with that lead|pg||
nt|thorvald: in danish unfortunately|pg||
nt|joest: Brogeland has something extra|pg||
nt|joest: and it still might not be enough|pg||
nt|thorvald: Suspecting some bad breaks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: isn´t 4@s far better than 3nt?|pg||
nt|joest: in the sense that it makes?  :)|pg||
nt|joest: not easy to offer a choice of games on this sequence though|pg||
nt|joest: Saelensminde dare not remove 3NT imho|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: Declarer has plenty of tricks.... but so do the defenders.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you would expect a better side-suit for a fit-jump though|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: and a @c lead against 3nt hadn´t defeated if Welland had played  @cQ from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham and Raju Tolani|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can only see 8 tricks in nt. anyone of you?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: i think S should have read the @H position on the previous hand|pg||
nt|tez: need agrement here..whats dbl?t/o to @d or good @c's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and not 5@d either|pg||
nt|sommer: no chance, I guess|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe even -2 after small @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: if see LH open with both majors - u bid 2@S in S? - not me - but I am old :)|pg||
nt|sommer: could be wrong to pass too, but you are right, Peter|pg||
nt|thorvald: But now it seems safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: well not a good hand for PRC i agree|pg||
nt|jtr: Hard to bid 5@c here|pg||
nt|thorvald: Hard to see any way to make 4@H |pg||
nt|roswolf: well a revoke would help|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2@d was good @h raise|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sommer: in these zones, W may be very light|pg||
nt|thorvald: Could be worse, but at least in a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Peter!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm bidding can be dangerous|pg||
nt|pelu: exp only down 1? |pg||
nt|ralfwil: can W find the @c lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on diamond leads south may lose control|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it's his partner's suit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: East is on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but East is on lead|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of tricks on crossruff|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: probably long suit, wekaish hand, and reasonable conclusion  |pg||
nt|mamos: standings after first two rounds of this strong tournament at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S would be second negative so 2@C shows some values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hence 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that may buy it|pg||
nt|andyv:  after W passed 1@s, the vul made it dangerous for E to further compete.|pg||
nt|thorvald: So one plan is to throw a @s on the Kof @H and the ruff a spade and 2 @Hs on the table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: once West turns up with @CA, North wiLl place @cA with East, so no ruffing club finesse  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, @hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: a trump back looks best|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2727.html  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 1@s might not be to everyone's taste, but it has worked well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be so good as the previous one...|pg||
nt|thorvald: I like the lead, making the defense much more easy|pg||
nt|joest: defense can just play passively|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mamos: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|xenya: they found a nice spot|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sommer: yes, this will be easy - guess, it will be bid all over|pg||
nt|thorvald: Understandable, but might give away the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can make|pg||
nt|pelu: close to make - @H placed wery well for decl|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs to take the ruffing heart finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: easy after the X of 3@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: may play on spades first when he is at least a trick short|pg||
nt|joest: as long as they are dedicated to removing the club ace|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: not a hand of great interest  -- Butler style scoring I think  effectively imp Pairs    scored on 80-0 match basis|pg||
nt|mamos: ten boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: total imps across the field, two results scratched, with a cap at 40 imp  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pairs are given 40 imps so no negative scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't lose more than the 40 IMPs you have when you start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big scores in the last round:  80-0  77-3  and  71-7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South probably wants to bid, but he has no guarantee of a fit anywhere |pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: Screens are not in use|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 75 minutes to complete 10 boards|pg||
nt|pelu: ????????????????|pg||
nt|thorvald: Interesting, not place for any mistakes in the defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite so|pg||
nt|andyv:  not an easy hand to play from either side|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice underlead by Bocchi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
nt|thorvald: Difficult to find the last, but a duck in clubs might have helped|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: yes but it is a misfit hand and i would therefore pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c ruff before drawing trumps is best|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: Bet Zia got the 80|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sommer: now a @S trick can be promoted|pg||
nt|sommer: ..for W|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sommer: @C@C@C..@H..and @c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzsh: Zia 73, but Nystrôm 80|pg||
nt|mdgraham: low trump?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: a bit bow and arrow if you ask me i like trial bids over a nat raise - std methods are often best|pg||
nt|joest: this was not the sort of result north-south needs to mount their big finish|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! another @c and the same continuation|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: you can understand the @CK lead - East wanted to draw trumps as quickly as possible |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: but no problem here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jtr: It would have been a lot more interesting on a @c lead|pg||
nt|xenya: excellent lead of course -- a normal-looking heart allows it to make |pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: for standings after round 6 go to http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2728.html|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  E might pitch @h here|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sommer: ..IF W had covered|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and lucky now when @s are 3-3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Vladimir!|pg||
nt|joest: hi vladimr|pg||
mc|7|nt|suketbombi:  will cash out for 120 to helness|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
pg||
qx|o13|st||md|3SQJT8H985DAQ62CQ5,SAK63HK642DJ9CAT2,S92HQ7DKT854CJ876,S754HAJT3D73CK943|sv|b|nt|Walddk2: I said Auken, not Christiansen|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Madala showed all his cards to declarer and claimed one down|pg||
nt|bagman: Auken had so much extra that he thougth he could cope with bad breaks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bagman: In 4@S he might have weak trumps and go down on a bad split with 9 tricks in side suits|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: bad result if EW misses this one -- does Madala has enough to bid 4?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I had expected Bocchi to bid 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|pelu: he also has to make 4@H - dovn on @D-lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but we don't know which lead he would get against 4|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR: @S lead, @H to 10, @C to 10 and B 1S again and now a @D-loser on the 4. club|pg||
nt|pelu: so a very good results for the polish pair in CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS lead second and 4th through declarer|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: decl can play @S again - and later force NS to open @Cs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: He can afford to pass the @HJ to endplay N to open up the clubs|pg||

nt|suketbombi: nodd needed tho|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Sry abou the start. The players started before time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: np|pg||
nt|pelu: no qsueeze :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: for standings after round 7 go to http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2729.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Welland: Sry|pg||
nt|thorvald: But zia would be endplayed on a club-lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2730.html  for standings after round 8|pg||
nt|thorvald: But I guess it will happen at most of the tables|pg||
nt|jtr: There are a few weak NTs around|pg||
nt|thorvald: And now a slam EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a chance to see the e/w slam methods|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Ralph --and everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: He might be able to eliminate the hand though|pg||
nt|roswolf: normal or just a rubbish multi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@H   seems normal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Ns game here too - just a question of which one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT or 4@h|pg||
nt|sommer: at least one would be quite safe, imo|pg||
nt|xenya: E would have been squeezed on the last trump, yes|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 @H here|pg||
nt|sommer: only for one overtrick:)|pg||
nt|mamos: if 1NT is 12-14  may play ther|pg||
nt|jtr: He can get out with a  trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: 2NT=12-13 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: so it should be a huge win for the Poles|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ndemirev: 4H is a normal destination here |pg||
nt|ndemirev: 6H could make double dummy |pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S shud fail with E as declarer as well previous board|pg||
nt|thorvald: No preempt with 2 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: fourth highest of dummy's longest and strongest |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Lead 3.-5.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, fifth|pg||
nt|pelu: decl has to look for his 9. tricks in @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny heart position - suit is blocked. Of course South canot know that |pg||
nt|roswolf: but he may have to play for it in effect|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S misguesses @H think will fail if EW play passive defence|pg||
nt|pelu: look like !§D10 is the correct card - woring - then West easy can set up his @D - so 1. trick on @DK and then @D to 10 - to keep control|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H =p/c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: or not :(|pg||
nt|sommer: this may be American Stayman|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another thinnish game|pg||
nt|thorvald: But then restricted choice no longer apply i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2MA is better than 2@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy NS game on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well he would win in dummy and play a @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty for info|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ndemirev: 3D  must show 5+H|pg||
nt|ndemirev: now Welland may find another bid |pg||
nt|suketbombi: we say sorry for Being late not being ahead of time:)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that 1NT NS is 14-16 - 2. time N open 1NT on 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Then ruff a @d and play trump  If Zia had Hxx he would be endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: Might have raised @cs here|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 tricks to start with|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be straightforward - a strong club system shouldnt get overboard|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4th suit forcing will get the job done nicely|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now East have described the hand as 3-5-1-4 with extra values, West hand doesnt look that slammish, but a single vs 3 small diamonds are nice|pg||
nt|roswolf: feisty auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: east should let this go|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D could be on a void - diff to find 5-3 fit here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the actual position for these pairs is?|pg||
nt|pelu: 1 and 12|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 1st, EW 12th|pg||
nt|roswolf: for standings after round 13 go to http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2735.html|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is surely not East thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Well played by Nyström, just a overtrick at stake here|pg||
nt|mamos: East has poor Spades  and knows declarer only has three minor cards|pg||
nt|sommer: S showed 4c@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: It was|pg||
nt|sommer: hi Søren:)..gl and well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: hi povl|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h was a sort of two-way shot here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: yes..specs ask me..I am right..it is puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe they make something maybe we do|pg||
nt|cicus: when they open 1@C we won't undestand the bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: no screens in use|pg||
pc|s9|nt|thorvald: And a lot of possibilities to mare more :-)|pg||
nt|thorvald: *Make|pg||
nt|joest: depending on the NT range, a somewhat marginal Stayman call|pg||
nt|joest: even finding the trump queen won't be good enough here|pg||
nt|bt: han låter flickvännen gå|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: this looks hopeless|pg||
nt|pelu: spects tell: 15-17 - but Helness also open on 14 - seen 2-3 times here in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|sommer: is @H 3-3 with @HA right enough?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, they play 15-17.. but upgrades a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: still has to lose a club|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: i expect @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT was an alternative, when holding both the red aces. But he might prefer West to play it, perhaps with some red queens.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mamos: ah well|pg||
nt|sommer: quite normal in US to jump to 3@C changing from normal to (Am)puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sommer: lucky @C's too..it MAY make!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Interesting 3@D by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D seems far too busy for me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike! with a 5-card @c...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Board 2: If dec keep @dQ, East might discard his diamond|pg||
nt|thorvald: Anyone that would have found a 3rd hand opening in south ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: but if they upgrade often - the syetm sh tell 14-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I confess I'd be quite happy to defend 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: to me it is obvious|pg||
nt|thorvald: On board2 East have to ruff the heart and can't dioscard a diamond|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps East read a bit more into 2@s|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ndemirev: 14-30 i guess |pg||
nt|ndemirev: this lead may tip Zia to actually making it |pg||
nt|sommer: I think it's ok to upgrade with 5c's or 10's/9's|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is almost a pure 50% but at this form of scoring a poor proposition imo|pg||
nt|roswolf: is this passable!?|pg||
nt|thorvald: My guess: 1@C = strong, 1@D negative, 1@H relay and West will be describing his hand, with 4 spades, 5 diamonds, 3-5 hcp, and East will set the final contract (4@S)|pg||
nt|cicus: NS may set the final contract :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: well 3NT can make even on a club lead, as North have no entries|pg||
nt|cicus: I think E is contemplating 6@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: more likely i agree|pg||
nt|cicus: probably knows full distribution of W|pg||
nt|roswolf: that wont be a success and as leaders why take a flyer!?|pg||
nt|thorvald: We have seen them bid very aggresively on slams, and with great success|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they are locked into @S 3nt as a general slam try is ok|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not? @dQJ10 and @cQ are very nice cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @hQJ10...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two rounds of diamonds will be awkward|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Yes S has only 2 @hs|pg||
nt|thorvald: As pointed out by one of the kibitzers 6@h is better|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond leads will allow welland to produce a trump coup to succeed i think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos: same sort of idea|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 1nt is flexible in their hands|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes specs have noticed 3NT makes|pg||
nt|thorvald: Hoping for 2 @d-honers blcoking|pg||
nt|brolucius: (2@C was game-forcing. The so-called two-over-one system).|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: ok, that was not right:)|pg||
nt|pelu: a bid gping from + to -|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: what conclusion can Zia draw from this lead?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ndemirev: We'll see :) this is Zia|pg||
nt|roswolf: conservatism usually works when holding a lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sommer: this is a walk in the park..N will probably take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there might be a few NS pairs in 3NT here - particularly if North starts 1NT|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|xenya: Zia and his nose...|pg||
nt|roswolf: play should be very quick|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: West has one king or 2 Quens. "We know nothing about the jacks"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that was an odd first two tricks :) |pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must now play @cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: N/S: It happened before|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: a endplay against East will now work|pg||
pc|s5|nt|thorvald: Now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As W I had preferred 6@h with @hQJ10|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the play would be easier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two rounds of spades and then a long pause...|pg||
nt|thorvald: I can't see how he can shorten him self, so to me it looks like one down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: now 6@C would have been more challenging...|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|xenya: not my cup of tea, vulnerable and soft scattered values|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he found a possibility to discard a @d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: west will come under pressure soon|pg||
nt|pelu: thats ok - but opp shuld be told |pg||
nt|roswolf: obviously the system has a flaw then|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sommer: @H@H now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: just needs the trump finesse -no trump coup available since suth has only 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Must iness in @c and ruff the 3thirs before playing @h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|thorvald: 6@C is makeable, but not biddable i think|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: still has to guess @H I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: just to endplay S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sommer: y|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sommer: very lucky, indeed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cA now and a @d|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes the trick is not to be carried away here|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not so sure it makes|pg||
nt|thorvald: This is a match between the 4th placed and the 6th placed pairs. Both hoping for a good round and get in the top 3|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sommer: 2N!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H=pre-emptive|pg||
nt|andyv:  W should be able to dbl here|pg||
nt|pelu: ok I see now - late4 :(:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not the strongest opening bid in the world|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed better to be lucky rather than good - but GOOD + LUCKY = WORLD CHAMPS i suppose:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The cards lie well for a heart contract.|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s may run into choppy waters|pg||
nt|thorvald: This would have been more interesting on a @D-lead|pg||
nt|joest: rebid 3@h or 2NT?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sommer: ..not that 3N is a good option;-)|pg||
nt|sommer: wow|pg||
nt|xenya: surprise|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: only 26 hp:)|pg||
nt|ndemirev: The slam was not good a pecentage but it paid off well. They must pick up a huge swing on the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like that reverse|pg||
nt|thorvald: How are your methods to get out after a reverse ? |pg||
nt|cicus: 3@C is most probable stop|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes well "blackout" is popular|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S now and 2NT by N is not forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NS 10-12 NT 1st/2nd - no upgrade here|pg||
nt|peacokk: 1@D 11-13BAL or 4@S/@H 4+@C/@D|pg||
nt|sommer: missing "game" with 26!!..26=game:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but not in this|pg||
nt|xenya: and a 5-card suit, and primes, and intermediates...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 5@D is an Optimum Contract wonder what 3@H was shortness with a Minor leangth?|pg||
nt|jtr: But you might bid it if East rebids 3@c|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: EW may bid game and not  make it here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Walsh means that you can respond in a 4-card major when you have longer diamonds.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks finis|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: East may double|pg||
nt|roswolf: for standings after round 12 go to http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2734.html|pg||
nt|thorvald: AT the other table we have the current leaders Nyström and Bertheau, and they missed the game at Board 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 4@C from West and they will reach 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: very restrained|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north will backpedal furiously now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: feet firmly on terra firma|pg||
nt|roswolf: the green card works again|pg||
nt|jtr: Applies when you rebid 1NT missing out a major|pg||
nt|thorvald: promising 4-card support, now Bocchi will bid the game|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should pass - well done|pg||
nt|thorvald: I used to play 2@S as non-forcing using Weak Jump Shift, but nowadays 3@c seems to be the only way out|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sommer: I for sure expected E to bid 2NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  I never care for bids where the weak hand takes pd out of 3NT range|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Nystrom-Bertheau made 6@H on board 21|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as they are playing against the second-placed pair, that won't do them any harm|pg||
nt|roswolf: invitational with that c*** -geez|pg||
nt|cicus: 2NT is often played as a puppet to 3+C then any bid is signoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed gabor|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Maybe and misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|thorvald: If you push this one to game as West you are making it hard for partner to keep open at situations like this. Its a strong NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Players talks on last board:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead solves most of the problems|pg||
nt|thorvald: Again the 4 in major is better, this will be difficult because only one entry to the table|pg||
nt|joest: i suspect Brogeland will win in hand and pass the ten of clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2nt is ok with me, but my bid on N is 3@s and ask partner to choose between 3nt and 4@h |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|sommer: this is a "walk in the park"|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|suketbombi: excellent contract|pg||
nt|jtr: Not a nice hand to play|pg||
nt|thorvald: But still spades are 3-3|pg||
nt|thorvald: and opps can make 2 @H so 1 down is not that bad|pg||
nt|jtr: But you block the @ds taking the finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: Sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that easy to defend either|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems right to play a @h through now|pg||
nt|thorvald: No you will play clubs trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|jtr: And let partner play another @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's minor-suit honours may look of dubious value to him, but in fact they will prove useful. |pg||
nt|jtr: In the USA a lot rebid one major not promissing @cs|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sommer: 9 or 10 |pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: probably nine tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: EW lucky -- this time|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but he didnt like his 6 loser hand|pg||
nt|mamos: on previous board NS bid game on 24 withoiut blinking  seems very odd auction this board|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pelu: Zia follow the same plan as Helness - and will be down 1|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact the last thing the defence want is an early @d ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: hope so or these guys will have to give up the red meat for breakfast|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: @d2 was Malmø|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why 4@s on W |pg||
nt|mdgraham: odd - expected 4@H from West over 4@D|pg||
nt|joest: last chance to cash the ace of diamonds :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: 3@H shows a singleton|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia is trying to shorten declarer so he cant use the @ds|pg||
nt|jtr: But i rather think Welland will get endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: One of those hands where you know the exact shape at trick one|pg||
nt|brolucius: When the opener raises responder's major, it is possible that he has only three-card support. It is therefore important to have some sort of continuation that allows you to check ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: how many cards he has for you.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: close choice between 3N and 3@H i  think -- but i never thought of 3@S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sommer: ..11?:)|pg||
nt|sommer: last chance for @HK|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes I was told stiff with many hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it can't be a bad plan, then|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sommer: it is right NOT to bid to hard on "white" games, but this was VERY cautious (read "too..)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|nt|jtr: 4@s went down on 11 at the other table|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S here are using 2@S for that purpose.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and indeed, there is a case for East to bid 4@h over 4@C |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sommer: W will have an open @C finesse now for 11|pg||
nt|jtr: Big catch up for Bocchi against the leaders|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ndemirev: this should make on normal play |pg||
pc|sT|nt|thorvald: Non-vulnerable you don't have as good odds for bidding borderline games|pg||
nt|jtr: Scores on http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Madala held only trhee-card heart support, he would bid something like 2NT or 3@C instead of 3@H. |pg||
nt|jtr: After the previous round|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: perhaps West took 4@d as a choice of majors rather than strictly natural|pg||
nt|thorvald: 10 tricks now on a showup-squeeze|pg||
nt|joest: Jassem defending straightforwardly, hoping partner has some partial heart help|pg||
nt|ralfwil: just to be sure to reach game|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sommer: was this good?|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like an easy one, yes|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there is a handling problem with both majors breaking badly|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Zorlu might be able to tell the exact shape of the defenders' hands after this trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think @sQ had been better than @s9|pg||
nt|ndemirev: at least it will be a fair assumption |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ndemirev: So all will depend on how he plays the hearts |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks two down |pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: play @sK|pg||
nt|ndemirev: K here will kill dummy |pg||
pc|h3|nt|thorvald: S is trying to transfer ace of@D to north, why I don't understand, we dont want declarer to know we have Queen of hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South has opened 1NT - West will know where @DA is|pg||
nt|thorvald: Alas just ducking to give partner a ruff|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cannot see any way to make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no - if he plays a trump he will get forced |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|thorvald: Bocchi and Madala was allowed to make 4@H on board 2 because Ventin underlead ace of @D as his opening lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and squeezed for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: he has ten top tricks now, even without a squeeze|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but a show up....|pg||
nt|joest: as long as clubs not 4-1 he knows he has nine even if hearts dont come home|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|xenya: nos S can get a @D ruff -- down 1!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: Welland needs to be careful about being endplayed|pg||
nt|thorvald: He cant ruff this one, but let partner ruff the next @D|pg||
nt|jtr: Another @s would have effected that|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Nice duck with @dK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: and that´s why W should have played @sQ|pg||
nt|ndemirev: looks down now i think|pg||
nt|xenya: so the @SQ was MUCH better -- now or earlier|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: If he ruffs this and exits with the @cK the defence are stuck|pg||
nt|jtr: If Zia overtakes he ruffs|pg||
nt|jtr: If not he pitches a @h|pg||
pc|hT|nt|thorvald: 1 down, squeeze on S|pg||

nt|jtr: Sneak a @c through?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 3@c would be 6@c|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: ok now|pg||
nt|roswolf: another feisty hand perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm this hand is also tricky|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks tricky in 3nt|pg||
nt|thorvald: It was a very nice duck with the ace of @D. Taking that trick would have given declarer a possibility to make the contract|pg||
nt|joest: since he could have made thehand by playing hearts first if east is 6-1-3-3|pg||
nt|xenya: yet another dram|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: interesting distribution|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still it would have been rigt to try hearts and then the clubfiness|pg||
nt|xenya: yet another Norwegian drama -- third in a row|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: another straightforward game hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Notice the pass by Zia|pg||
mb|2C|an|Nat or 2 suits|nt|ndemirev: A mighty club opener by Zia|pg||
nt|jtr: He wont be surprised by the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Madala is thinking and Bocchi points at the coleurs|pg||

nt|roswolf: well maybe not so tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this may have its interesting points|pg||
nt|jtr: Horrible rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this might get too high|pg||
nt|thorvald: Does not look like a 2@C bid to me|pg||
nt|cicus: awkward hand for N, many invent a 1@S response here|pg||
nt|joest: good chance Brogeland was playing for a swing there, b/c he thought (correctly) he needed one|pg||
nt|joest: he got one|pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: 6@h is ok now.but very hard to find|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia is very disciplined with his opening bids|pg||
nt|jtr: Wise when you play with Welland:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why it's better to hold Aces, Mike:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I know - but I never get any of those|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree thorwald|pg||
mb|2H|an|MA, !s not longer|nt|mamos: the last three or four times Ive watched there have been loads of eight and nine cards suits  the dealing machine seems to have  the balanced box ticked today|pg||
nt|roswolf: a choice og games|pg||
nt|roswolf: of|pg||
nt|cicus: I like 2@C by a passed hand|pg||
nt|joest: this is a situation where it is good to know how high north-south is forced and whether doubles here are penalty or just 'more cards'|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: Not in 3rd hand as we have seen :-)|pg||
nt|jtr: 2NT not perfect but expresses the values well|pg||
nt|thorvald: Well, showing 6-9 by agreement makes at lot more attractive :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have bid 1@S but they have a gadget - works here a treat|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this wont play too well|pg||
nt|thorvald: How many tricks on a spade lead ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead and expensive|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ndemirev: after this start it should be in play|pg||
nt|roswolf: a safe level|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: At matchpoints, North might bid 2@S. At IMPs he would be worried that partner could place him with a better hand. Stil, I think some players would bid 2@S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Partner cannot do much damage on a passed hand, even if he does think you have a better hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2@s would be @s+mi and 2@d is multi (NT-defense)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see. Thanks!|pg||
nt|jtr: AKA Reverse Cappelletti|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's not common in Chandlers Ford|pg||
nt|jtr: Banned i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can place the @DA with South because North did not overcall.|pg||
nt|jtr: @cK too probably|pg||
nt|jtr: But he cant afford to cross with a @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: @c2 in hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Warren Spector|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: geiger|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: may duck this, then @sA and another later |pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 2@H was USP, I think|pg||
nt|sommer: =good @Sraise|pg||
nt|sommer: USP is short for Usefull Space Principle|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of a psychological trial for EW here. You go off in a reasonable slam and game, and then the opposition bid and make three games in a row   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: First prize in this event is 50,000 Danish Kroner, around 7,000 Euro, US$ 9,500|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy to get the impression that it's not your day|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: where are they going here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@d must be a slam trial- or?|pg||
nt|roswolf: only god and zia knows|pg||
nt|warrens:  oops, looks like they've missed their chance.  might be 3 in a row gone awry|pg||
nt|thorvald: Zia do not want to play 3NT, when opps are know to hold 9 spades, but 5@C doesnt look like a winner|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @s9|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sommer: 23 hcp but makeable game|pg||
nt|thorvald: He needs to pick up the spades, and cant afford to duck the hearts, so its ace, play spades, with a finess of north and using diamonds as an entry|pg||
nt|xenya: will probably go down though|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but will E ever find @SQ?|pg||

nt|xenya: they were running second before the last round -- i doubt they are anywhere near that now|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: well, same auction to 3@D at the "other" table, but East bid 3@h and West 3NT  |pg||
nt|roswolf: this does look a woolly auction 5/6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: MIke and I want some exciting hands  -- perhaps if all the specs cross their fingers ..................|pg||
mb|4D|nt|tez: 5@c 1/4 6@d is asking @d king|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  I was told bad things happen 3 at a time in bridge.  What if you have 4 bad results?|pg||
nt|roswolf: -3 looks like|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this is another board that does not look very good for EW|pg||
nt|warrens:  It's the start of a new set of three.:9|pg||
nt|warrens:  :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: INDEED|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Break for lunch after this round. Restart at 15.20 local time, in 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
nt|thorvald: Then it will be 3 times 3 bad boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: A spec spotted this play earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Garner-Weinstein vs Bertheau-Nyström at this table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Helness-Helgemo vs Zia-Welland at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Great matches|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@c isn't too bad - has good chances if clubs are 2-2. Unfortunately, they ain't|pg||
nt|roswolf: and very slow pplay to boot|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|sommer: guess not..my guess is -1 or 2|pg||
nt|mamos: not unless North carelessly drops it  !|pg||
nt|ndemirev: @S A, @HQ and @DK |pg||
nt|ndemirev: is good for 7|pg||
nt|joest: lack of entries to dummy should doom this one|pg||
nt|thorvald: Would have been easier just to pass 2@c for a +-score :-)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|brolucius: A diamond through the @DA (an avoidance play) will give him time to set up a spade too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  life would be easier for W if E had one the first @s and led back the Q@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|Walddk4: First prize in this event is 50,000 Danish Kroner, around 7,000 Euro, US$ 9,500|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the way things are going EW will be lucky to score 0|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Chandlers does not have an apostrophe I believe|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh it does|pg||
nt|warrens:  10 of @C a good try, hoping for a cover from HHx|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|suketbombi: @S partial offered the best chance but 2nt is practicle and defence will get a @H a@S and 3@CS|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Zia-Welland in this room next round|pg||
nt|sommer: IF you want to negleckt the rule of 9-never, you rather finess S for @SQ because of the opening, so the game was "unmakeable"|pg||

nt|xenya: so the problem was not to bid 6 but to avoid bidding 7|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there were no inferences as to the @H Q one way or the other |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: East claimed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do you have a new keyboard? Unlike you to use apostrophes.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: In London they can't decide if it's Earls or Earl's Court|pg||

nt|ralfwil: If W had played @cQ to ruff and @d10 from dummy.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I bought a new keyboard rather than another of your books|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ndemirev: One could argue Zia did open the bidding but that doesn't mean much |pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: of course he was playing to make|pg||

mb|p|nt|sommer: 4@H sonn for S|pg||
nt|jtr: Welland operating|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but otherwise it looks a normal 4@H contract|pg||
nt|ndemirev: So declarer did well to go with the apriori chances|pg||
nt|xenya: great set for Zia/Welland so far|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the last round today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 tomorrow, 4 Sunday|pg||
nt|ralfwil: how many @s from W? 2 or 3?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sommer: ..soon, even|pg||

mb|d|nt|peacokk: 1@C 16+ 1@D negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|pelu: in the "good old days" u could bid 3@D in W 9-11 - and but the board|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2@S looks safe to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an unexpected variation|pg||
nt|thorvald: 6@S will be hard to bid ,and i think it will go down because of the bad @D-break|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: vul isnt in his favour|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is idiosyncratic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure why 1NT - can open 1@C and rebid 1@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: 2@D presumably transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D 0-4 zz points|pg||
nt|mamos: Wse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: zz points: A=3, K=2, Q=1|pg||
nt|sommer: again, no real challenge..coffetime|pg||
nt|sommer: ruffingfinesse @D for overtrick after @HAK|pg||
nt|andyv:  shows the value of the hand|pg||
nt|thorvald: They will be happy that this round is running out of boards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sommer: this board belonged to EW:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but has been hijacked|pg||
nt|sommer: ..even a VERY lucky 3N dd:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala judges that he is too strong for a 2@S response to the take-out double. He shows his strength with a cue-bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: sorry West thinking?|pg||
nt|pelu: and buy the board|pg||
nt|pelu: Board 12 - final contract in OR also 2@s - but played by EW - Zia in 3. seat open 1NT on his 1-2-4-6 hand and Roy aked for major|pg||
nt|pelu: down 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: even at green i dislike souths 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: AND BLOOD IS ABOUT TO FLOW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yes   maximum   and good tricks |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and more will come!|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- this does look like a partscore hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 11 tricks in @HS for e-w and wud get to the game|pg||
nt|jtr: he deosnt care about trivial matters like that:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might not play well|pg||
nt|thorvald: Whats the range for ventins 2NT. Partner bid a free 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Why lead @hs?|pg||
nt|jtr: Good question|pg||
nt|jtr: about the range i mean|pg||
nt|thorvald: What would 3 @S be then ?|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder what N's X meant|pg||
nt|thorvald: West should lead a trumph |pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: I couldn't hear the explanation |pg||
nt|roswolf: x was tempting fate|pg||
nt|cicus: because it seems to me S expected more|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: X of 3@d was penalty:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ??????|pg||
nt|joest: wow|pg||
nt|thorvald: wonder if North guesses this|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mamos: East knew keycards were missing|pg||
nt|peacokk: Nyström didn't cue a shortage in partners suit and they were at the same wavelenght, well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 2@S intervention seems very aggressive|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s are doomed now|pg||
nt|cicus: hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might make six on a non-club lead|pg||
nt|sommer: oooo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S would show around 8-10, in standard systems, but the fifth card in the major is worth at least 2 points extra.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html  for standings after round 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, some would bid 3@S on that hand. |pg||
nt|jtr: For those that have sad lives- http://www.eleflat.co.uk/Earls_Court-65_SW5-info.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So you can get any result from 40-40 to 80-0. We did have a couple of 80-0's|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: again just the odd overtrick to be played for|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match at this table: Weinstein-Garner vs Blakset-Røn|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=transfer to hearts, 2N=transfer break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect 3@d=re-transfer, but not sure |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt must be a supper accept and 3@D a retransfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was told 2Nt also announced a min hand in their methods|pg||
nt|suketbombi: every card working overtime and Q ( of @CS in will make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Q9 of @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: pew|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia wants to look at trick 1|pg||
nt|pelu: the major-hand - helgemo-helness overbord in 4@D NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West needs to push a diamond through at an early stage  |pg||
nt|thorvald: There seems to be 5 top loosers and a spaderuff|pg||
nt|pelu: @S-ruff will cost the @D-trick|pg||
nt|thorvald: yes, after that lead|pg||
nt|joest: Brogeland painted quite a picture there, including the penalty double of 2@d|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: At the other table: Zorlu-Assael vs Bocchi-Madala|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|joest:   of ways to combat this|pg||
nt|joest: most play a jump to 2@s|pg||
nt|thorvald: just 4 down and a huge pickup for Norway :-)|pg||
nt|joest: is weak|pg||
pc|c4|nt|thorvald: Does 2@D promise extra values as it suggest an offshape take-out double ?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ndemirev: 4S here is a desaster on the layout. |pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S by S is for me an overbid - max 3@D = invit with @s-support|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S Ok - but 4@S - I dont understrand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next round at this table (20 mins past the hour): Helness-Helgemo  vs  Martens-Jassem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2728.html  for standings after round 6 |pg||
nt|roswolf: table speed is slowing down|pg||
nt|pelu: even if decl eliminate the red suits and play @C to the A he go down ruff-discard dont help him 4-4 in C|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about 1NT with 5M422 |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pelu: now @S-ruff in|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: it certainly worked well here.|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s might just be competitive although that seems like sort of a normal bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|suketbombi: this will be quick from here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup another odd view from the americans|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, with @C's 4-4, he can make if he guesses a red suit |pg||
pc|h2|nt|ndemirev: 3N had some remore chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: N's X was negative and didn't create a force. N could pas  2@s|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ndemirev: *remote|pg||
nt|pelu: the 10 IMP came from board 2 - Welland in 3NT - lucky here when @dAK in N|pg||
nt|joest: alternate: pass and then bid spades, which shows values in case someone is clowningaround|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t understand why W didn´t show his @s as fast as possible|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|thorvald: Clubs are 4-4 so Welland just need to play on @D and guess those, but hearts are attractive too|pg||
nt|joest: that will have Jassem bidding game at warp speed|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sommer: he scared me:)|pg||
nt|sommer: may go 3 light now, but it was still impossible to pun..imo|pg||
nt|cicus: it was maybe hard for W to lead a small spade|pg||
nt|cicus: then E could have returned a black card without losing a trick|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: looks like a low diamond coming|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could even exit with a club if he thinks they are 4-4   |pg||
nt|warrens:  he might exit a @C, but that forces him to pitch 2 @D's from his hand, not great|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now North did part with a @D - does that change anything ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but why not bid conventionally and ok boringly and then it wouldnt matter|pg||
nt|warrens:  I would try Ace and a small @D.  might see something useful from S or might luckily endplay N if he has Hx in @D and you misguess|pg||
nt|warrens:  in fact, since N pitched a @D, 2 rounds of @D's gives him 2 chances to get it right|pg||
nt|warrens:  with the actual layout now|pg||
nt|roswolf: even if he makes he still loses an imp|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: the Slam played by East would have been difficult to defend perhaps|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d8|pg||
nt|sommer: and 11|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, no problems for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: That was right|pg||
nt|thorvald: Bocchi and Madala continuing a great set at the other table and are closing the gap - Standings at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2733.html|pg||
nt|xenya: surely Jassem thought a forcing position had been created?|pg||
nt|joest: not sure what 2@h here was: perhaps just 'pick a black suit now that you have been doubled in 2@d"|pg||
nt|warrens:  anyway you look at it, well done by Brogeland|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|h7|nt|ndemirev: *one more "disaster" :) |pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|roswolf: YES|pg||
nt|warrens:  not sure|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s3|nt|roswolf: another plus score from nowhere for zia|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s4|nt|sommer: but no beer:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: coomes down to this|pg||
nt|thorvald: If that was the plan I don't understand why he didn't cash the last spade before playing @D|pg||
nt|warrens:  He took away his chance to guess the @D first.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: a brilliant piece of insanity if he gets this right !!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Welland: Sry pd|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after this long thinking - i guess he will misguess|pg||

nt|warrens:  I think it's very, very difficult to play well after a string of poor results.  |pg||
nt|warrens:  Well done|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: West can assume South holds @DJ - which means North has three hearts and South two|pg||

nt|mdgraham: another hand with @C AKQ10 seventh|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and that too in @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Madala has 14 cards and Bocchi 12|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :):)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not good|pg||
nt|suketbombi: not fair also:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: TD sorted it out|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes flattish bd|pg||
nt|sommer: y, 150 will be common|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed david|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a momma papa slam|pg||
nt|jtr: Potential slam here|pg||
nt|jtr: Hmm not quite mmomma papa is it?|pg||
nt|thorvald: It seems the slam will go down, but I think it will be bid 15 vs 15|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he bids again|pg||
nt|brolucius: Normally he has to, unless he is a passed hand perhaps.|pg||
nt|roswolf: cool for cats|pg||
mb|3S|nt|thorvald: As 3@C is making this was an ok contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: (wasnt possible to get the beer..and the o.t.)|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy to bid and provided rightsided trivial to make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so @hK more likely to be with the 3-card holding - so West did well to get that right   |pg||
nt|roswolf: From @HKxx N might have pitched a heart instead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, you'd rather be in the slightly easier 4@S |pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: 'Forcing to suit agreement' is a phrase that you often see.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia: well played|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2732.html  for standings after round 10|pg||
nt|cicus: quite light vul overcall|pg||
nt|thorvald: Knowing hearts was 4-4 from the start the odds doesnt change|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what about 1nt instead of D on S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: thats what pards are for|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: Preempt Ok with KTx in @H ?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzsh: Bocchi want 6 cards more|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 5@C an excellent contract but if NV E-w will fight hard and get to 5@H wud be a bad result for them|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: can NS get to 3NT now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mamos: 3NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can all see 3NT is good - but South can't see the KQ to six|pg||
nt|pelu: but for sure  Nt better than 4@S - also every time @D are 4-3 - so I will take lucky back :) and just compliment Zia-Welland :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: h/h again frisky|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think they are playing High-low double here|pg||
nt|cicus: now how does N avoid playing in 4@H?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now he denies 4@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|sommer: EW are playing a system called "Nusine@C"|pg||
nt|thorvald: How will you make it on a @d-lead ?|pg||
nt|jtr: Transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Very useful if partner has Kx|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder why he did not bid 3NT immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, i think a helicopter is needed to reach dummy and make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Bocchi: He plays better?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is that a common method, David. I can't remember hearing about it before.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Weinstein: slower|pg||
nt|jtr: I have seen it before  maybe with this pair though|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: In my opinion E has to act and bid @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia: Bid 3@h pd|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w in 3nt?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..they were in 1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Jassem is thinking:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i know this is a TTASL position|pg||
nt|sommer: will Jassem realy raise now??|pg||
nt|sommer: dont think so|pg||
nt|pelu: Jelness could have passed 1NT out - now EW - with 26 HCP are close to 3NT|pg||
nt|sommer: E 1NT was too good|pg||
nt|roswolf: ttasl -TEACH THEM A SHARP LESSON|pg||
nt|sommer: he has 15..but 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: ie bid game and make it when you could have passed them out in partscore|pg||
nt|andyv:  another safe contract|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think so.  A109xxxx a good suit for a non vul 3 level preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: lol mike i think she could|pg||
nt|sommer: 8 losers...|pg||
nt|jtr: Welland probably has one but i am not sure about Wrang|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think a @h lead is the only way to make it, but looking at west hand a heart might be the only way to beat it, knowing partner has an ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heliocopter might be available|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point thorvald|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, it might be necessary to set up a trick before partner's ace is knocked out|pg||
nt|roswolf: also welland is prone to this sort of play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D=weak with 6+@H, or stronger with 5+|pg||
nt|pelu: easy make when @s10 drop|pg||
nt|warrens:  and a K on the side ok|pg||
nt|warrens:  even in @H's|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: although she will shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will w]be good/bad news|pg||
nt|brolucius: Often played as a splinter bid.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well some sanity returns|pg||
nt|warrens:  1N is reasonable, but Qxx, Jxx and Kxx are pretty poor holdings, so I don't think the hand values out to 15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, that's true Geoff (about the @h pitch) |pg||
nt|warrens:  more like 13.5-14|pg||
nt|warrens:  no spots higher than an 8 either|pg||
nt|pelu: but S can finess with @s9|pg||
nt|pelu: Zia-Welland X 3@H - and took the @S-ruff = 300|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: typical pairs action - pre-empt to the limit, then let the opponsnts sort it out. |pg||
nt|jtr: South has not shown his values yet|pg||
nt|jtr: He has now|pg||
nt|cicus: after this bidding his spades are even less tempting|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now a trump?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: too late tho|pg||
nt|mdgraham: shouldn't matter - one spade ruff brings down the queen |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Think it required an initial trump lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: can set up @DS too while @Sak intact @Ds 3-33 or JX best chance|pg||
nt|pelu: again: we have a lots of spectators I like all the comment, but I dont like that there are so many "John Do's" - pl update your profil with name and nation - many commentators dont ...|pg||
nt|pelu: answer chat from thus "no-name" spects - please :):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a good start|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Bad/bad news?|pg||
nt|sommer: wow ...sryyyy|pg||
nt|sommer: that was strange:)|pg||
nt|sommer: imho|pg||
nt|pelu: only few boards to go - but in a long match that bidding will slow NS down a little :)|pg||
nt|jtr: OK All academic|pg||
nt|roswolf: anyway no real test now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: quite an unusual lead - @DQ must have been an option|pg||
nt|jtr: DB99 knows all these things|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Interesting to see how many make 6@S on 13, if anyone else is in it that is|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: play low|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@d here has to be competitive, otherwise South may get frozen out with a strongish balanced hand|pg||
nt|peacokk: Not much in the play here, we all would score the 9 obvious tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as to the suit quality (and length) required, well...|pg||
nt|cicus: safety play in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: lets look at the decl play : @S to J and A - @s7 from West - finess the 9 if from 87 - but top if 107 og 3 card |pg||
nt|thorvald: This looks 2 down to me|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, and quickly at that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sommer: Nusine was Blaksets cat..I think:)..must be dead for years now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, diamonds are 3-3 and there are the entries to set them up|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no can set up @Ds in isolation|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can bid 2@S otherwise, hoping that partner can rebid NT.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cicus: protecting @SQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: First prize in this event is 50,000 Danish Kroner, around 7,000 Euro, US$ 9,500|pg||
nt|thorvald: He can afford to loose that club, even though its hard to see a hand where West doenst have King of @S|pg||
nt|cicus: indeed|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sommer: Tor will be unhappy with his 2@D:)..|pg||
nt|pelu: Martens can only see 8 tricks - but wjen he play @C - he will smile :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Only problem in 6@S is that Wrang has 4 hearts, so against the slam i think I would have lead the unbid suit - anyway this one will have no problems  11 trcicks ?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh|pg||
nt|pelu: here we go|pg||
nt|roswolf: wd|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sommer: answer to many: It wasnt the cat, who invented the system:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Thought he would overtake and finesse @c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sommer: ..Lars did|pg||
nt|cicus: and 8 of spades also showed 4 small ones - as a spec tells me|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs to get their diamond trick set up|pg||
nt|pelu: easy come - easy go - now the "D-loser can be parked on @C|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes biters bit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: anyway, a good game safely in the box for NS |pg||
nt|sommer: the good thing is, he cant go wrong:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..good for EW:)..not for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: If S has Hxxx in clubs there is an endplay?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah well you win some you lose some|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: unfortunately S has no more diamonds -- if N had cashed the @DA first...|pg||
nt|sommer: so..7 tricks for E|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|ndemirev: Sorry, my network I suppose |pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: excitement?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is going to be a long auction|pg||
nt|ritong: losing one in the process|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of iMPs for the swedes - but most of the IMP are lost in OR|pg||
nt|thorvald: On the lead of Ace of @C its not that hard, but wont all bid some minors with the east hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: weird|pg||
nt|jtr: How mnay @hs?|pg||
nt|jtr: many|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ndemirev: 6@H earlier was worth 17 imps |pg||
nt|thorvald: Non vul, passed partner, 4@H and let them guess|pg||
nt|jtr: How ever many, North will bid @ss|pg||
nt|jtr: Well maybe not over 6@h:)|pg||
nt|cicus: Nyström had the same shape 2 boards before|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: Nort is going to use some room|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose if partner ALWAYS made their contract i would forgive a few overtricks:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would bid only 3@H with that suit.|pg||
nt|xenya: E will raise?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Well done to stop in 2C in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|joest: if given a second chance.  don't see how you can get in on the first round|pg||
mb|2C|an|!ds|nt|xenya: on 14, where EW went down in 2@S here, Madala in the other room managed to make 3N -- quite an achievement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you D on E or bid 1nt?|pg||
nt|ndemirev: you can click on "movie" to review the played boards|pg||
nt|sommer: like 2@S X made?:)|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@d may get them to 5@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: Make it KQ10xxxx and I might be as adventurous as you.|pg||
nt|xenya: via 4@D|pg||
nt|thorvald: Only 4@S is secured, and now the double fit have been revealed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the last round today we get to see Bocchi-Madala vs Bertheau-Nyström at the other table. What a match, second against first! In about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|jtr: And, as a spec noticed, 5@s goes down|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@D is a fit-showing bid - obvious when he is a passed hand, and probably the same even if he were not.|pg||
nt|thorvald: A new partscore, I guess 2@s will be the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: as yes. Didn't see the Norht hand.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT-3NT looks good|pg||
nt|brolucius: West will have a tricky decision what to lead against a high club contract.|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems a boring board|pg||
nt|cicus: they have a gadget to show this hand type|pg||
nt|roswolf: they will get a shift on now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sommer: the made 3NT at least one table ("OR") in b14, where E passed 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup:)|pg||
nt|sommer: again we saw an upgrade..this time from E|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but the 3 10's are ok to evaluate it as 12|pg||
nt|roswolf: north is fixed by 2nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would too|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mamos: WEst isnt going to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: pity - would have been fun to see all the EW relays |pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|sommer: you are a fast typist!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..easy to be faster than me:)|pg||
nt|sommer: hard for S to pass 2@S, but here it looks too tough|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks another minus score in the viking column|pg||
nt|warrens:  the X risks getting N/S too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not really Povl :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: looking for 5 card major or else 3Nt i gues|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Helness: 4@h i S has a chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup gadgets galore|pg||
nt|roswolf: and south doesnt say anything|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzsh: Board 7|pg||
nt|thorvald: Claim :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: o:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, diamonds becomes more attractive than hearts, because you expect that suit to be ruffed early.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: not an exciting hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but 1NT=15-17, West investigates a possible club slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: now that is a view by north|pg||
nt|roswolf: now n/s being imaginative|pg||
nt|joest: i confess I like to open 1@c with 5-6 in the blacks|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, me too, unless system doesn't allow it|pg||
nt|joest: with the boss suit, I can always just keep bidding: and usually do :)|pg||
nt|xenya: this is not the Polish style i think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: i was about to say how should West make a slam try  he found a way|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical shot, 6@h - 7@H may be on but how to bid it if it is? |pg||
nt|ralfwil: is this correct?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|cicus: no unfriendly lies this time|pg||
nt|warrens:  the club position makes 3N magical.  not, it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might start with 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but sometimes it's not worth the strain|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the CC, it looks like West was finding out about a 5-card major|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's not just Hx of @C's onside, it's H9 that makes it work!|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: yes that is what I thought|pg||
nt|warrens:  4?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: should be defeated - heart ruff, trump promotion on the @S10|pg||
nt|pelu: we try again - correct bidding but by EW :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Yes, this is correct:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one problem sloved|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "solved"|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2NT is 4+@c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With that hand many players open with 1@c and jump to 2@s - showing a good hand and a 5-5+ suiter|pg||
nt|thorvald: So 2 down ?|pg||
nt|joest: four is a pretty big bid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|thorvald: South would have bid 4@S with an ace and a king i think|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2726.html  for standings after round 4|pg||
nt|sommer: after 1N - p- p - 2n you must giive p some "space"|pg||
nt|reisig: hmmm|pg||
nt|joest: of course it's possibly Jassem thinks Marten is 6-5 the other way|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: as West could have transferred to clubs |pg||
nt|suketbombi: strip squeeze for 11th trick:)|pg||

nt|suketbombi: no N discarding after |pg||
nt|ritong: agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like may be down 2|pg||
nt|thorvald: The first double probably showing 18-20 bal, and there is 21, but to me it looks bad|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: short break|pg||
nt|sommer: I was just told, "Nusine" actually was Knut's cat... I was almost right..I said "Blaksets cat" ..and "Lars invented it...quite correct anyway|pg||
nt|sommer: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/NusineClubOpeningBids.html|pg||
nt|ndemirev: I get a note that 17 may not be correct - It would mean that everyone bid 6H and went down. Not entirely impossible |pg||
pc|cA|nt|thorvald: He didn't believed the actual layout|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sommer: 2n=2x|pg||
pc|c3|nt|suketbombi: S can guard @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: but that just looks normal to duck trick1|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|roswolf: passivity doesnt pay in strong club auctions - intervene at any cost imo|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|andyv:  bad only because it forces pd to the 3 level and if he doesn't have @cs or @hs, the hand will not play well (QJ of @s may as well be xx)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|thorvald: He was afraid of a shift to spades|pg||
nt|pelu: I am impressed of the operators 4 hard days - close to 200 boards - and very few mistakes - well done Søren and Jan !!!!|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: http://www.copenhagen-bridge-invitational.com/  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|cicus: he probably did not have a bid available to show 4333|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: this is bridge but not as we know it|pg||
nt|warrens:  Zia now knows that declarer has 6 @C's and 3 @H's, so unless he's going to play for declarer to have a stiff spade, this is straight forward|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  Erik Kokish might overcall 1@s|pg||

nt|pitiful:  looks like 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 3 spades and a heart ruff + 3 diamonds and a @CA|pg||
nt|bagman: Some complications might come from the 5-2 trump break (violation of Burn's law) but most ways lead to 8 tricks with the @SQ dropping and E having 3 diamonds|pg||

nt|Walddk2: First prize is 50,000 Danish Kroner, around 7,000 Euro, US$ 9,500|pg||

nt|bagman: NS cannot make 5@D as there are 2 hearts and one club to lose (at least) and cannot make 3Nt as there are 5 hearts to lose; so no big deal if NS score some plus|pg||

nt|roswolf: refreshing to find someone not bashing a game|pg||
nt|roswolf: whem in doubt double for t/o and then try to work out where to play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 2 mins|pg||
nt|joest: too little too late I'm afraid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that possible heart slam was bid on board 6 - unforunately, North was on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10-12|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 9 tricks for EW and 5 for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 12 tricks next door - Helgemo tried the @DK opening lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: all the spot cards making a difference here|pg||
nt|peacokk: EW might be in trouble now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not for the rest of us|pg||

nt|andyv:  a quiet 3N?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 1nt from E?|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: and now will h/h hustle here as well?|pg||
nt|jtr: We may see another type of 3@s bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers are saying that West should have gone to 5@H with his diamond fit.|pg||
nt|jtr: No|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they are.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup:(|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@d is @hs|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could bid 3@D with a stronger hand. His actual 3@S is pre-emptive.|pg||
nt|jtr: More @ds later i imagine|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: yes - this could end up in something doubled - no, South has come to the rescue|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: I am slow I still dont see how he maded 4@S? ruffed a @c and played @hK?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s looks sorta obvious|pg||
nt|roswolf: the americans dont do "obvious" quickly:)|pg||
nt|sommer: wasn't it --2, ope?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah had enough!?|pg||
nt|sommer: Søren?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Seeing the 2 hands NS what is your preferred contract ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems dangerous|pg||
nt|joest: i would think it might go 2@s all pass here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ndemirev: It will brobably be a partial |pg||
nt|jtr: Wow The leaders bid and made 6@h on 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@d forcing?|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems odd that it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: wasnt 2N -2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: No @d conn|pg||
nt|roswolf: another bizarre bid by west - but there again what do i know!?:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, it's something doubled, anyway|pg||
nt|mamos: well  it came to something doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just not by EW|pg||
nt|sommer: tough, but makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: East took one @d|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sommer: the stiff @DK helps W|pg||
nt|suketbombi: to early for him to run the @H to T with so many chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most people hate leading from four to the jack - will South run it?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S/4@S 3@HS a @C + possible 2@DS may not run|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: It was easy?|pg||
nt|roswolf: to us palookas yes:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt|pg||
nt|cicus: 6 NT if no club lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Unless 2@D was forcing to game.|pg||
nt|thorvald: He bid a free 2@H so he must have some values|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sommer: with @HAK in S, he may even score an overtrick..but I think, he will try to make 8 first:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now he can count 3 spades and 4 clubs and a diamond, when NS dont start ruffing @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Zia-Welland missed the game in 14 (6 imp)|pg||
nt|sommer: ahh, ok|pg||
nt|jtr: Well did he bod a free 2@h?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now showing a strong raise in @D - is 6D not where you want to be on any lead ?|pg||
nt|cicus: 4-3 spades is 62%|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ritong: he opted for the bid which was closest to his cards i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Welland ask ab lead|pg||
nt|jtr: bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: firmly|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: three rounds of hearts then three rounds of spades then four rounds of diamonds finds east endplayed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ndemirev: 3D was a nice bid |pg||
nt|thorvald: Ofc depending on whether the transfer is showing values or just suit|pg||
nt|jtr: Advanatge of transfers there is that you can be weak or strong|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2@D is a transfer, that usually means that you are free to bid it on a weakish hand with hearts, as David implies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Madala is showing his @ss|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D otherwise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: onward and upward|pg||
nt|roswolf: another magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|thorvald: Fully describing the hand as 0-5-2-6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Madala will dare not reyrn a @H:)|pg||
nt|pelu: prob down 1 - but 2@S makes - so.. - in OR EW bid over 3@C|pg||
nt|joest: club switch right now breaks all that up: but just for the o/t|pg||
pc|dT|nt|thorvald: with @hs 3-3 its makeable, but I don't think he will guess it|pg||
nt|ritong: double then @hs is not really attractive|pg||
nt|ritong: neither a direct 2@h|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@hs and exit @c?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: But, as someone points out, 4@c maybe creates the game force|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: EW clearly seem to have misjudged   not clear what South's 2@D showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2@d nat nf|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't see anyway to beat this|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: return:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Helgemo has 10 6 in @h|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peacokk: Pass was probably forcing and DBL for penalties|pg||
nt|tez: defence has 6 trick in 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems not|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sommer: now @SAKQ and @C's|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D is likely now i feel|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzsh: yes|pg||
nt|peacokk: Pass by Nyström over 2@D|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cicus: this is even better|pg||
nt|roswolf: commentators curse strikes again|pg||
nt|thorvald: Hard to find the @c lead in 6NT, but this is just doomed|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: but an intelligent decision by Auken|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: east wont be happy until he sees pards @S10|pg||
nt|thorvald: Explain why you want to play 6@S and not 6@D ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: What is he going to do with all his spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think he can make it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me looks like -1|pg||
nt|warrens:  not enough pitches, oh, I miscounted|pg||
nt|warrens:  thanks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs the five outstanding trumps to break 2-2 |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah an inspired comment!:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or @cQJ doubleton|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cicus: I may miss something but I can see the same 12 tricks if spades behave|pg||
nt|joest: now Saelnesminde will pull a trump, three rounds of diamonds, ruff a heart to hand and put east in|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play on @d now, and E is endplayed like Jack said|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: can make 9 by endplaying S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may play clubb to the Q now |pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: as spects point out: only down on @D-lead! the @H can be set up til discard 2x1D |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: South probably knew tha EW could not pass 2@D out|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|thorvald: exiting with a @s will still see him home as south wil be squeezed before declarer|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jtr: WEll, if South could cash teh last @c it wouldnt work|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe a match where the score will not add up to 80|pg||
nt|roswolf: or a club discard by west or pigs might fly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Time's up|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hT|pg||

pc|dK|nt|suketbombi: yes He has unblocke @H8 i was told:)|pg||

mb|5D|nt|Walddk4: 3NT can't make on best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But difficult to find|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but it is a practical try|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: If you are member off a Nordic Bridge Federation pls visit http://bbonordic.com/|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not at all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next round in 5 minutes|pg||

nt|mamos: nice  sfae spot|pg||
nt|mamos: safe|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Thanks Mike Thanks to Soren for the great Job and Many thanks to all KIBS for their Comments|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Second that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @c5?|pg||
nt|thorvald: I dont think 3 nt are having any chances here, perhaps on a @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@d=0-4 zz points |pg||
mb|5N|nt|tez: last here..ty all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like declarer has to pin @d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty to Soren, our operator, to Roland, Mike, Thorvald and to all the specs who make this game so enjoyable.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ask sometone to buy you a sandwich, Søren|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: lol:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: At the other table NS stopped in 1@S but Bocchi competed and NS went quickly to 5@C |pg||
nt|cicus: I am being called to the lunch table every 1 minute now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ZZ points: A=3, K=2, Q=1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: It looked like East had done enough in the bidding before 5C |pg||
nt|ralfwil: by playing @dQ and after that @d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 90|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry Dinner and after that going to a theatre!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry all, must go. See you later. Thanks all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: HE-HE are N/S|pg||
nt|pelu: If porblem with the board - then good that its a flat 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: np now for the players. Only for me:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start in 15 mins|pg||
nt|pelu: have u seen the - almost - killing lead? @s7 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: That would be fun:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bertheau led @CK and Røn dropped the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then came the switch, but a diamond|pg||
nt|jtr: Now @h@h @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: 20 opposite 4 does not play as well as 12 opposite 12, because you cannot move backwards and forward so easily.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is a transfer to 2NT if opener has 19-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he hasn't he bids something else|pg||
nt|thorvald: 4@C showing @H i think, and 4@D agreeing ?|pg||
nt|joest: frankly I'm surprised Boye isn't already playing 7@h now that he knows about four aces|pg||
mb|6H|nt|vugraphzsh: all alerted|pg||
nt|roswolf: well interesting sequence|pg||
nt|pelu: remember 2@H making by Helge - Bocchi-Madala bid and maded 3NT - a lot of right placed cards -: finess for @SJ - need 2 entries to dummy for the double-finess in @H |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the italians walked on water on that one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After this round there will be a break for lunch. Restart at 15.40 Danish time, in 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|pelu: almost flying :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: 1@H natural or relay, 1@S 4+@S 4+@C/@D i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  have some work to do here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are probably 50 kroner at the venue. And 38 kroner for a Coke|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Just guessing|pg||
nt|thorvald: See you again in the next round, this shouldnt have any difficulties|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: lots of bids  getting high|pg||
nt|mamos: albeit slowly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@h=natural or any hand that wants to use relays |pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy easy to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: sorry all, must go. See you all tomorrow.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Will Silla?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR : 1ut -3ut :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Zia led a spade|pg||
nt|thorvald: it looks like 9 tricks on that lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spade lead next door|pg||
nt|roswolf: well game let through on the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And Helgemo had to guess|pg||
nt|joest: 4@c showed hearts I'm told and then came blackwood|pg||
nt|joest: he knows he is not facing a king so the grand can't be very good|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: this has been a fascinating set of boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was an auto auction - only one way to go|pg||
pc|s3|nt|warrens:  has to guess who has the spade K|pg||
nt|thorvald: He just had two bad boards will this be no. 3 ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  bye Mike|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D better|pg||
nt|suketbombi: $@S was a good contract difficult to Judge the Right values|pg||
nt|roswolf: cool|pg||
nt|thorvald: He need to pick up the @d and play East for @HHx and Ace of @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 26 imps on the fate of this one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sommer: this 2@C is (in Italy at least) called Gazzilli|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slight surprise West passed over 1@S with @HKQx - maybe they don't play support doubles |pg||
pc|h6|nt|suketbombi: 4@S|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 tricks but Bocchi found a safe-play for 10 (if @ds 4-1!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Specs suggest thaat the ruffing finesse is the percentage play. Why can't West have Kxx instead of East?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks everyone, bye|pg||
nt|pelu: @S3 lead from Zia - almost 50-50 in major|pg||
mc|13|nt|brolucius: At the local club some would not notice the fall of the 10 and the 9, but Bocchi has eagle eyes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Last boardBocchi shows @s6|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: That all, thx for this year:)|pg||
