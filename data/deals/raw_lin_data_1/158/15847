mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: 2@h=good raise in spades|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: we have here almost the same spade suit as earlier when i mentioned declarer just has to play it for two losers|pg||
nt|athene: this time leading to the king right away won't work so well|pg||
nt|iceking: needs to do little more work|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may have to ruff a heart in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: but of course this hand there is more work to do in the other suits yes|pg||
nt|iceking: has to do well make this one it seems|pg||
nt|pocken: Interesting bord, I think he´ll start with a heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if he has to ruff a heart or a diamond in dummy he may well lead to the @SK|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||
nt|iceking: @H Q now |pg||
nt|athene: bocchi played ace and another heart and west ducked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bocchi did not lose a heart trick :)|pg||
nt|athene: it's really not a day for these expert ducks :)|pg||
nt|athene: we saw Nystrom against 4@H earlier|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this time he will be on the other side|pg||
nt|iceking: Fredrik might take some time one this |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair, usually when someone plays ace and another you don't put him with QJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I guess it was Bertheau that was the "duck" in the last round:)|pg||
nt|iceking: its far from clear what is correct line here, and here we see 2 world class players pick different line|pg||
nt|athene: and if he has Q10 you think if you duck he is likely to misguess|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe east could pitch the 10 to avoid this?|pg||
nt|iceking: this doesnt look like making does it|pg||
nt|athene: no, because the hearts aren't good|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|iceking: might end few down here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: no - if North ruffs a diamond he will need to find @sA onside|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: so even if you did guess the spade layout you just can't do everything|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|s2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs to ruff a heart too|pg||
nt|athene: he might ruff a heart in dummy and then hope for doubleton @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: or he might lead a spade to the king and hope for a 3-3 heart break|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: so it is a great board for the italiens (in 2nd) compared to the swedes (leaders)|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt many will make game here|pg||
nt|athene: if you do go for the heart ruff you are still often losing to a trump promotion on the club anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: scores after round 9: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: you could also try the heart ruff and then hope for a doubleton @S10 and lead the @SJ to pin it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d7|pc|s8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: ok he tried the @HJ just so he could see if they were 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: trying to get the best of both words|pg||
nt|athene: both worlds|pg||
nt|athene: but now even if east had @S10x and west had @SAQx for example, you are down to the trump promotion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no direction home|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: This information is only for the "scandinavian viewers": HUSK, at melde dig ind i BBO NORDIC -- saa du kan være med i turneringen den 14. november 2010|pg||
nt|athene: (west captures the @SK and leads a club)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham, Mike Amos and Erik Fryklund|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In theory, a match can finish 80-0, but that is theory|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS?|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Tez|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia is 1 with 212 and Zorlu is 2. with 192|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: small upgrade from N?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and south might do the same|pg||
mb|2C|an|Drury|nt|Walddk4: Auken-von Arnim  vs   Bertheau-Nyström|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like a normal 4 @S, but with open cards 3NT looks better to me|pg||
nt|thorvald: A partscore in @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: NS 2nd, EW 9th|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe 3@S now|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, they play 15-17, but the 5c is treated as 1 extra|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: We will get names up soon|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 16 +16 to start with|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html  for standings after round 2|pg||
nt|mamos: my brain needs start up time  but cant see 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|peacokk: A squeeze |pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
nt|roswolf: choice of games here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to David Bird|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: are the norwegians awake enough to bid this slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed thorvald|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|xenya: hello David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html  for standings after round 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was just looking through the VG records for this event. Several big boards yesterday.|pg||
nt|jtr: Thought you were away somewhere (exotic)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room eventually is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@c i imagine was Drury|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's singleton ace in partner's suit is not a good omen for bidding on.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peacokk: Probably not the best line to play anyhow|pg||
nt|peacokk: in the long run|pg||
nt|tez: zorlu assael have 9 card @h but very bad split|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: S hand, despite the 14 count, is too slow. Passing 3d is very reasonable |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Roland. 4@d must be in no danger, so 3@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: MGrand possible - which will fail|pg||
nt|sommer: good game|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a club lead to break 4 of a major i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: this isnt best contract|pg||
nt|sommer: still makeable|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, 3NT much better|pg||
nt|roswolf: and duly reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: defence looks favoutite here|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia downgraded his @ss to 4 cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, Drury, you think.|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice to have 7 in case partner forgets:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: You are right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: flat hands are often disappointing|pg||
nt|sommer: if W takes the normal way in @C's, NS must hurry to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: something lower you think Povi?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Garner/Weinstein will let it through|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is ok;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is also a winner but difficult to spot|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|roswolf: with the diamond finesse working 13 tricks are there|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C 4-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: it wont be bid - of course|pg||
nt|jtr: Happens|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4-0|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some pairs use Safe Drury.|pg||
nt|jtr: You are Mrs Bird perhaps?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade support, with clubs... just in case.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, but my wife is. Are you feeling OK?|pg||
nt|jtr: Some work sorting this one out|pg||
nt|thorvald: Any suggestions of how to play this ?|pg||
nt|jtr: You and sorry:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: just a question of how many - not enormously important at this form of scoring|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|sommer: got the chance there!|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry |pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: in grand u have 12 tricks by finess @cJ - but if decl start ruffing @Ds for the 13. trick he is down - only the finess for @dK will give him 13|pg||
nt|jtr: Tried to steal a @s trick|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still playing to get as many tricks as possible, i think he will play clubs next |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sommer: not easy for S to shift from KJ6|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe these guys are world champs or something:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The scoring is IMPs so big pick up possible here for HeHe|pg||
nt|thorvald: on a heart continuation that is|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, his entries are getting tangled now|pg||
nt|jtr: The @d is quite effective in that regard|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, might be tricky|pg||
pc|h5|nt|thorvald: he can afford 3 spade loosers, but its getting messy |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|jtr: This works well to start with|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Well, maybe 5@D can go down on a club lead, but East would never find that|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt and 5@d was makeble..5@c beats only @c lead (may be)|pg||
nt|xenya: also difficult to defend though|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: for standings after round 8 go to http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2730.html|pg||
nt|jtr: All becomes well|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|jtr: Good cash|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: West did not go in with the @HK because (a) it would assist declarer in developing his second suit, and (b) he might have had a Q-10 guess there.|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he might just lose 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Bocchi: Clubs are good:)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d7|nt|pelu: an "normal play is: @sA @d to A @D ruff, @C to king and entry shor - he need to play @C to finess|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: cross-imps across the field, top and bottom scores excluded. |pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html  for standings after round 9|pg||
nt|jtr: @cJ now ad hope the ruff is with 3|pg||
nt|jtr: and|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One more round after this today, the remaining four tomorrow|pg||
nt|thorvald: Perhaps ruff the @D first|pg||
nt|jtr: And hope for 2 trumps in hand  Yes|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|dJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Matches have a "cap" at 40 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm oh well perhaps you have to be a palooka to make this one|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not clear which of those two lines is better, or Bocchi would already have moved into action. Ah, the club.|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks normal|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jtr: Works if the ruff is from Hx too i think|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|sommer: well done|pg||
nt|sharkey: "palooka"?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very basic(poor)player|pg||
nt|pelu: this line succes if @Ds 4-2 and @Cs 3-1 - the best plan - but failed here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: life is cruel|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|pc|d2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: so is bridge - you win some you lose some|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|nt|pelu: agree - only a weak player would make :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: with difficulty|pg||
nt|iceking: impossible hand just have to bid 3nt and go 2 down |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: my Double Dummy Solver says that the best result here is 5@d NS -- I will bet no pair bid that :)|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Now they avoid the 3NT trap|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: 5@C is a very good contract once West opens|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|iceking: yes it is |pg||

mc|11|nt|Walddk2: Stroganoff is even better|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but not even a try? not like Zia!|pg||
nt|suketbombi: that was a quick job|pg||

nt|brolucius: Happy days...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Well, 14 balanced with @SQx. I understand pass|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Welland could have started with a 2S (as a passed hand) to encourage Zia to bid more |pg||
nt|roswolf: i bet bocchi/madala wont miss out there|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jtr: And its subsequent forms|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S|pg||
nt|ndemirev: HIs hand was great in context |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is a match from round 6 and the last today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they're ok in 3NT, but 4@s looks likely|pg||
nt|pelu: just the opening Martens hoped to see :(:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: strong club, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  any 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=relay (I think), may be 20+|pg||
nt|peacokk: I guess they will end up in 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: The @c opening works well here lead wise|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: can they get to 3nt by west?|pg||
nt|jtr: Or could have:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like 4@H to me depends on reading the @h right - or wrong because the right solution is the antipercentage one|pg||
nt|thorvald: This wasnt the right contract with that lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Declarer has plenty of tricks.... but so do the defenders.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: and a @c lead against 3nt hadn´t defeated if Welland had played  @cQ from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham and Raju Tolani|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|xenya: i think S should have read the @H position on the previous hand|pg||
nt|tez: need agrement here..whats dbl?t/o to @d or good @c's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and not 5@d either|pg||
nt|sommer: no chance, I guess|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe even -2 after small @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: if see LH open with both majors - u bid 2@S in S? - not me - but I am old :)|pg||
nt|sommer: could be wrong to pass too, but you are right, Peter|pg||
nt|thorvald: But now it seems safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: well not a good hand for PRC i agree|pg||
nt|jtr: Hard to bid 5@c here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sommer: in these zones, W may be very light|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: probably long suit, wekaish hand, and reasonable conclusion  |pg||
nt|mamos: standings after first two rounds of this strong tournament at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S would be second negative so 2@C shows some values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hence 3NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2727.html  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 1@s might not be to everyone's taste, but it has worked well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be so good as the previous one...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mamos: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|xenya: they found a nice spot|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sommer: yes, this will be easy - guess, it will be bid all over|pg||
mc|7|nt|mamos: not a hand of great interest  -- Butler style scoring I think  effectively imp Pairs    scored on 80-0 match basis|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: fourth highest of dummy's longest and strongest |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Lead 3.-5.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, fifth|pg||
nt|pelu: decl has to look for his 9. tricks in @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny heart position - suit is blocked. Of course South canot know that |pg||
nt|roswolf: but he may have to play for it in effect|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S misguesses @H think will fail if EW play passive defence|pg||
nt|pelu: look like !§D10 is the correct card - woring - then West easy can set up his @D - so 1. trick on @DK and then @D to 10 - to keep control|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H =p/c|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mamos: or not :(|pg||

nt|roswolf: another thinnish game|pg||
nt|thorvald: But then restricted choice no longer apply i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2MA is better than 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well he would win in dummy and play a @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty for info|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ndemirev: 3D  must show 5+H|pg||
nt|ndemirev: now Welland may find another bid |pg||
nt|suketbombi: we say sorry for Being late not being ahead of time:)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that 1NT NS is 14-16 - 2. time N open 1NT on 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Then ruff a @d and play trump  If Zia had Hxx he would be endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: Might have raised @cs here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peacokk: Well played by Nyström, just a overtrick at stake here|pg||

nt|jtr: Maybe they make something maybe we do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks hopeless|pg||
nt|pelu: spects tell: 15-17 - but Helness also open on 14 - seen 2-3 times here in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|sommer: is @H 3-3 with @HA right enough?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, they play 15-17.. but upgrades a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: still has to lose a club|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: i expect @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT was an alternative, when holding both the red aces. But he might prefer West to play it, perhaps with some red queens.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: ah well|pg||
nt|sommer: quite normal in US to jump to 3@C changing from normal to (Am)puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sommer: lucky @C's too..it MAY make!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: but if they upgrade often - the syetm sh tell 14-17|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 14-30 i guess |pg||
nt|ndemirev: this lead may tip Zia to actually making it |pg||
nt|sommer: I think it's ok to upgrade with 5c's or 10's/9's|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: same sort of idea|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 1nt is flexible in their hands|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes specs have noticed 3NT makes|pg||
nt|thorvald: Hoping for 2 @d-honers blcoking|pg||
nt|brolucius: (2@C was game-forcing. The so-called two-over-one system).|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: what conclusion can Zia draw from this lead?|pg||

nt|ndemirev: We'll see :) this is Zia|pg||

nt|thorvald: promising 4-card support, now Bocchi will bid the game|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: I for sure expected E to bid 2NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sommer: this is a "walk in the park"|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: excellent contract|pg||
nt|jtr: Not a nice hand to play|pg||
nt|thorvald: But still spades are 3-3|pg||
nt|thorvald: and opps can make 2 @H so 1 down is not that bad|pg||
nt|jtr: But you block the @ds taking the finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: Sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that easy to defend either|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems right to play a @h through now|pg||
nt|thorvald: No you will play clubs trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|jtr: And let partner play another @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's minor-suit honours may look of dubious value to him, but in fact they will prove useful. |pg||
nt|jtr: In the USA a lot rebid one major not promissing @cs|pg||

nt|mamos: on previous board NS bid game on 24 withoiut blinking  seems very odd auction this board|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: Zia follow the same plan as Helness - and will be down 1|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact the last thing the defence want is an early @d ruff|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: 3@H shows a singleton|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia is trying to shorten declarer so he cant use the @ds|pg||
nt|jtr: But i rather think Welland will get endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: One of those hands where you know the exact shape at trick one|pg||
nt|brolucius: When the opener raises responder's major, it is possible that he has only three-card support. It is therefore important to have some sort of continuation that allows you to check ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: how many cards he has for you.|pg||

pc|s6|nt|sommer: it is right NOT to bid to hard on "white" games, but this was VERY cautious (read "too..)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|jtr: 4@s went down on 11 at the other table|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S here are using 2@S for that purpose.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sommer: W will have an open @C finesse now for 11|pg||
nt|jtr: Big catch up for Bocchi against the leaders|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ndemirev: this should make on normal play |pg||
pc|h8|nt|thorvald: Non-vulnerable you don't have as good odds for bidding borderline games|pg||
nt|jtr: Scores on http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Madala held only trhee-card heart support, he would bid something like 2NT or 3@C instead of 3@H. |pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|sommer: was this good?|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like an easy one, yes|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there is a handling problem with both majors breaking badly|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Zorlu might be able to tell the exact shape of the defenders' hands after this trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think @sQ had been better than @s9|pg||
nt|ndemirev: at least it will be a fair assumption |pg||

nt|sommer: ..even a VERY lucky 3N dd:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala judges that he is too strong for a 2@S response to the take-out double. He shows his strength with a cue-bid.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: sorry West thinking?|pg||
nt|pelu: and buy the board|pg||
nt|pelu: Board 12 - final contract in OR also 2@s - but played by EW - Zia in 3. seat open 1NT on his 1-2-4-6 hand and Roy aked for major|pg||
nt|pelu: down 3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mamos: yes   maximum   and good tricks |pg||

nt|jtr: he deosnt care about trivial matters like that:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might not play well|pg||
nt|thorvald: Whats the range for ventins 2NT. Partner bid a free 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Why lead @hs?|pg||
nt|jtr: Good question|pg||
nt|jtr: about the range i mean|pg||
nt|thorvald: What would 3 @S be then ?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: East knew keycards were missing|pg||
nt|peacokk: Nyström didn't cue a shortage in partners suit and they were at the same wavelenght, well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 2@S intervention seems very aggressive|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s are doomed now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might make six on a non-club lead|pg||
nt|sommer: oooo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S would show around 8-10, in standard systems, but the fifth card in the major is worth at least 2 points extra.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html  for standings after round 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, some would bid 3@S on that hand. |pg||
nt|jtr: For those that have sad lives- http://www.eleflat.co.uk/Earls_Court-65_SW5-info.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So you can get any result from 40-40 to 80-0. We did have a couple of 80-0's|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: again just the odd overtrick to be played for|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match at this table: Weinstein-Garner vs Blakset-Røn|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=transfer to hearts, 2N=transfer break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect 3@d=re-transfer, but not sure |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt must be a supper accept and 3@D a retransfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was told 2Nt also announced a min hand in their methods|pg||
nt|suketbombi: every card working overtime and Q ( of @CS in will make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Q9 of @Cs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sommer: pew|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia wants to look at trick 1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: At the other table: Zorlu-Assael vs Bocchi-Madala|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|thorvald: Does 2@D promise extra values as it suggest an offshape take-out double ?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ndemirev: 4S here is a desaster on the layout. |pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S by S is for me an overbid - max 3@D = invit with @s-support|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S Ok - but 4@S - I dont understrand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next round at this table (20 mins past the hour): Helness-Helgemo  vs  Martens-Jassem|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an| |nt|sommer: (wasnt possible to get the beer..and the o.t.)|pg||

mb|3S|an|trsf to 3NT|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugraphzsh: Bocchi want 6 cards more|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT?|pg||

nt|roswolf: ttasl -TEACH THEM A SHARP LESSON|pg||
nt|sommer: he has 15..but 4-3-3-3|pg||

nt|sommer: 8 losers...|pg||
nt|jtr: Welland probably has one but i am not sure about Wrang|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think a @h lead is the only way to make it, but looking at west hand a heart might be the only way to beat it, knowing partner has an ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heliocopter might be available|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point thorvald|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, it might be necessary to set up a trick before partner's ace is knocked out|pg||
nt|roswolf: also welland is prone to this sort of play|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although she will shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will w]be good/bad news|pg||
nt|brolucius: Often played as a splinter bid.|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|suketbombi: now a trump?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: too late tho|pg||

nt|sommer: imho|pg||

nt|jtr: OK All academic|pg||
nt|roswolf: anyway no real test now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite an unusual lead - @DQ must have been an option|pg||
nt|jtr: DB99 knows all these things|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@d here has to be competitive, otherwise South may get frozen out with a strongish balanced hand|pg||
nt|peacokk: Not much in the play here, we all would score the 9 obvious tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as to the suit quality (and length) required, well...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sommer: Nusine was Blaksets cat..I think:)..must be dead for years now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, diamonds are 3-3 and there are the entries to set them up|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no can set up @Ds in isolation|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can bid 2@S otherwise, hoping that partner can rebid NT.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|sommer: Tor will be unhappy with his 2@D:)..|pg||
nt|pelu: Martens can only see 8 tricks - but wjen he play @C - he will smile :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Only problem in 6@S is that Wrang has 4 hearts, so against the slam i think I would have lead the unbid suit - anyway this one will have no problems  11 trcicks ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jtr: Oh|pg||

nt|roswolf: ah justing cashing his top tricks|pg||
nt|thorvald: INteresting hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: excitement?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is going to be a long auction|pg||
nt|ritong: losing one in the process|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ritong: weird|pg||
nt|jtr: How mnay @hs?|pg||
nt|jtr: many|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ndemirev: 6@H earlier was worth 17 imps |pg||
nt|thorvald: Non vul, passed partner, 4@H and let them guess|pg||
nt|jtr: How ever many, North will bid @ss|pg||
nt|jtr: Well maybe not over 6@h:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos: Nort is going to use some room|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose if partner ALWAYS made their contract i would forgive a few overtricks:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would bid only 3@H with that suit.|pg||
nt|xenya: E will raise?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|xenya: on 14, where EW went down in 2@S here, Madala in the other room managed to make 3N -- quite an achievement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you D on E or bid 1nt?|pg||
nt|ndemirev: you can click on "movie" to review the played boards|pg||
nt|sommer: like 2@S X made?:)|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@d may get them to 5@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: Make it KQ10xxxx and I might be as adventurous as you.|pg||
nt|xenya: via 4@D|pg||
nt|thorvald: Only 4@S is secured, and now the double fit have been revealed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the last round today we get to see Bocchi-Madala vs Bertheau-Nyström at the other table. What a match, second against first! In about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|jtr: And, as a spec noticed, 5@s goes down|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@D is a fit-showing bid - obvious when he is a passed hand, and probably the same even if he were not.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: as yes. Didn't see the Norht hand.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT-3NT looks good|pg||
nt|brolucius: West will have a tricky decision what to lead against a high club contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: the made 3NT at least one table ("OR") in b14, where E passed 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup:)|pg||
nt|sommer: again we saw an upgrade..this time from E|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but the 3 10's are ok to evaluate it as 12|pg||
nt|roswolf: north is fixed by 2nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: WEst isnt going to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: pity - would have been fun to see all the EW relays |pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|sommer: you are a fast typist!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..easy to be faster than me:)|pg||
nt|sommer: hard for S to pass 2@S, but here it looks too tough|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks another minus score in the viking column|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: not really Povl :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: looking for 5 card major or else 3Nt i gues|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Helness: 4@h i S has a chance|pg||
mc|13|nt|vugraphzsh: Board 7|pg||
nt|thorvald: Claim :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: o:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzsg: 2nt = 12-15 and at least 5-5 in @c+@d|pg||

nt|mdgraham: for some people, yes :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: refreshing to find someone not bashing a game|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: that possible heart slam was bid on board 6 - unforunately, North was on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10-12|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 9 tricks for EW and 5 for NS|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: all the spot cards making a difference here|pg||
nt|peacokk: EW might be in trouble now|pg||

mb|2D|an|!hs|nt|roswolf: and now will h/h hustle here as well?|pg||
nt|jtr: We may see another type of 3@s bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers are saying that West should have gone to 5@H with his diamond fit.|pg||
nt|jtr: No|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they are.|pg||
mb|3S|an|Mixed raise|nt|roswolf: yup:(|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@d is @hs|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could bid 3@D with a stronger hand. His actual 3@S is pre-emptive.|pg||
nt|jtr: More @ds later i imagine|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: yes - this could end up in something doubled - no, South has come to the rescue|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: I am slow I still dont see how he maded 4@S? ruffed a @c and played @hK?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s looks sorta obvious|pg||
nt|roswolf: the americans dont do "obvious" quickly:)|pg||
nt|sommer: wasn't it --2, ope?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah had enough!?|pg||
nt|sommer: Søren?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ndemirev: It will brobably be a partial |pg||
nt|jtr: Wow The leaders bid and made 6@h on 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@d forcing?|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems odd that it is|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sommer: wasnt 2N -2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: No @d conn|pg||
nt|roswolf: another bizarre bid by west - but there again what do i know!?:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, it's something doubled, anyway|pg||
nt|mamos: well  it came to something doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just not by EW|pg||
nt|sommer: tough, but makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: East took one @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: the stiff @DK helps W|pg||
nt|suketbombi: to early for him to run the @H to T with so many chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most people hate leading from four to the jack - will South run it?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S/4@S 3@HS a @C + possible 2@DS may not run|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: It was easy?|pg||
nt|roswolf: to us palookas yes:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Unless 2@D was forcing to game.|pg||
nt|thorvald: He bid a free 2@H so he must have some values|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sommer: with @HAK in S, he may even score an overtrick..but I think, he will try to make 8 first:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now he can count 3 spades and 4 clubs and a diamond, when NS dont start ruffing @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Zia-Welland missed the game in 14 (6 imp)|pg||
nt|sommer: ahh, ok|pg||
nt|jtr: Well did he bod a free 2@h?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: he opted for the bid which was closest to his cards i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Welland ask ab lead|pg||
nt|jtr: bid|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 3D was a nice bid |pg||
nt|thorvald: Ofc depending on whether the transfer is showing values or just suit|pg||
nt|jtr: Advanatge of transfers there is that you can be weak or strong|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2@D is a transfer, that usually means that you are free to bid it on a weakish hand with hearts, as David implies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Madala is showing his @ss|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|suketbombi: Madala will dare not reyrn a @H:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|thorvald: with @hs 3-3 its makeable, but I don't think he will guess it|pg||
nt|ritong: double then @hs is not really attractive|pg||
nt|ritong: neither a direct 2@h|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@hs and exit @c?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jtr: But, as someone points out, 4@c maybe creates the game force|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: EW clearly seem to have misjudged   not clear what South's 2@D showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2@d nat nf|pg||
pc|d6|nt|suketbombi: return:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Helgemo has 10 6 in @h|pg||

nt|brolucius: 20 opposite 4 does not play as well as 12 opposite 12, because you cannot move backwards and forward so easily.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is a transfer to 2NT if opener has 19-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he hasn't he bids something else|pg||
