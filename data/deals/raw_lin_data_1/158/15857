mb|2C|an|23+|nt|h_karluk: missing @h and @c A slam is out of question|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and @c A unfavorably placed tho @dK hook onside|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: so that's just an everyday 4@h for NS pairs|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: having 6151 at West @c ruff immaterial, especially when there's top trump (@hA)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but ruffing to 2nd @d brings a cheap trick and there's nothing to do|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 3@s may save the day |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: you know there's a double dummy defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d A + ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h K ( almost impossible in practice when one has AQ ) then another @d ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: normal practice is what Antonio follows, firm lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: good|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: -50 or 100, which immaterial in teams|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and in practice hard to pick which suit most promising after ruffed to 2nd @d|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: as the declarer's hand is hidden|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while seeing @c K96 at the table one may easily go on with @cQ |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: and there's singleton @hQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say everything guessed well, is there a potential hazard? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok let's count it out again|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s A, @h A, and a ruff|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think @d8 was better ( in case they play odd even signals)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now declarer draws a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and tackles diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or concede a heart|pg||
nt|h_karluk: takes a @d ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to 4th @d discards a @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzqp: Palma is thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and ruffs 2 times to table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so 4@s S=|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: i think he will play a @h|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh very good|pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: to @d west ruffs, to @c declarer ruffs|pg||

mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: i think ....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: with two aces and 6 cards trumps, add singleton @c, spades cool, also diamonds not bad, good decision|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now the matter is bringing 4@h to home, okay, let's take a deep breath and see|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|h_karluk: and as i can see not much problem, i think even i can make this one, lol|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i am not sure double is the answer there, i think 3@c more satisfactory, however it might be their agreement|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: you know many prefer to use take out doubles with at least full opener and having 3 cards in rest suits|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as passed hand the limit is good 10-11|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: time to think and analyse the lead|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the question is opening leader picked 4 cards or playing for his partner to take a @s switch|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: i think Gromoeller recognised it as 1st option|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: and his spade holding is in a quite good position|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: both red suits and enough points to play 4@h|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|h_karluk: maybe 4th suit forcing now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: oh yes 3@c is fsf (fourth suit forcing)|pg||

nt|vugraphzqp: the comentaries will be by Karluk, our thanks to him|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gromoeller is from Germany, as far as i remember|pg||
nt|vugraphzqp: Correct|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: thanks sir|pg||
mb|2D|an|one major|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|h_karluk: and i guess, in that case east is Ludge Silva, also from Germany|pg||
nt|vugraphzqp: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both pairs are established partnerships|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: so that will be indeed a very keen competitive match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1NT indicates an 15-17 balanced range|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two pass quite normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and in balancing seat Silva's 2@d conventional bid also reasonable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Pedro's double is not for hearts after initial pass|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: likely unusual vs unusual, implies ability to compete in other suits|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|d3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: in case Antonia bids 3@c his hand was ready to bid 3@d natural|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: sorry Antonio, my apologies to all|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|11-13|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and i think NS would be active to buy it with 2@s with their decent fit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: hmm, quite conservative but sure they know something about their opponents|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess they just didn't want to get any risk when both nonvul, just a part score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so they let them to play there|pg||
nt|vugraphzqp: e is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzqp: Silva*|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ludger found a nice dummy hand|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: especially in @d suit, just Ace outside, brings 3 tricks to him|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately hearts do not behave friendly to him|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both missing honors are offside|pg||
nt|h_karluk: split honors would be highly helpful|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzqp: Silva is thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now three spade and two hearts tricks are inavoidable to lose |pg||
nt|h_karluk: that is for sure off one|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ludge quite normally may thinking about is it a false carding or not, i mean underled ace or not |pg||
nt|h_karluk: *Ludger|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if both missing honors are being placed in North then nothing to do, but at the table one should consider many possibilities|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: for example say Ace in South|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: then North may get a cheap trick|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and enjoys with spades plus @h A|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: and you may win with @hK, then unblock clubs, enjoy with diamonds, so thinking about a crucial matter was quite sound|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
mc|6|nt|h_karluk: deceptive plays are quite well known for declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, was good try|pg||
pg||
