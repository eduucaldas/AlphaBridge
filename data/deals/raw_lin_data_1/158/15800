nt|ian111:  if he thought the D were 3-3 he could have relied on the long D for his 10th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  big double fit here for NS but only 10 tricks in 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the save in 5@c is likely which might push NS to 5@h|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|viren169: Asimple 4@H here... tough to reach?!?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: and he played it very fast ...|pg||
nt|ian111:  board 17 flat - but I preferred Spear's line|pg||
nt|mrdct:  gill might splinter in @h if available|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ian111:  a C at trick 2|pg||
nt|mrdct:  or introduce a clever psyche with a view to retreating to @c later|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: likely collect 2@H and then South will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|mango joe:  West cud hv made a negative X one wud hv thought|pg||

nt|mrdct:  north might suspect west has psyched now!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ian111:  yes - X seems normal|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4@H is a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 3@D now may get them there...|pg||
nt|figo: that he does almost always|pg||
nt|ian111:  4H very close|pg||
nt|mrdct:  actually - undo all of those comments - i believe EW play transfer over their 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mrdct:  1@h will just be showing 4+ @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  whilst NS can be held to 10 tricks, that depends of a defence of two black aces at tricks 1 & 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@H is 4 +@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: or 4@H as you say!|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D for us mere mortals!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@d MIGHT DO IT AND IT WILL GO OFF |pg||

nt|viren169: Not sure even I could go down!|pg||
nt|mango joe: a good vul sacrifice if he gets @S right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct:  this looks to be one or two down - so a lost opportunity for australia|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west has perhaps already shown his hand with his 1@S bid and ought to have left the 5-level decision to compete to east|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|ian111:  as so often - no one able to double|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|viren169: 5 @H + 3@S + 2 ruffs = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should find this defence |pg||

pc|c2|nt|viren169: have I missed something?|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Vicky|pg||
nt|mango joe: a 2@C opening in precision often has a  card major as it did in this case at the other table|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4 card major|pg||
nt|mrdct:  4@h for EW looks good here|pg||
nt|mango joe: he had a chance to test the @S and then perhaps guess if E had Kx or W had 10x @H|pg||

mb|2H|nt|paulg:  Irving Gordon won the World Senior Pairs with a 90-year-old Boris Shapiro|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm not sure what west's dbl means. perhaps a side 4-card suit where bidding 3@d would show 5-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: if Hemant jalan eam win here...the winner of the Aus vs Scotland will win the gold medal|pg||
nt|mrdct:  possibly a pass missed here|pg||

nt|ian111:  3H is a slightly fortunate make|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes with QX@S onside|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Same for u and kibs Paul|pg||
nt|mango joe: This hasnt been an exciting set so has favoured the teams leading in their matches|pg||
nt|mrdct:  it's been a long month of bridge for paul gosney who played in the Rosenblum, then the World Youth Championships, then the Commonwealth Nations and now the HCL - I'm sure he's feeling a little bit homesick by now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: NS have now passed the best contract 3nt|pg||
nt|mango joe: dont much care for Norths opening as he doesnt have a rebid over 2@Cs|pg||
mb|4N|nt|garnetts: They have also pinpointed the defence too --no heart control |pg||
nt|viren169: North was hoping they went on!|pg||
nt|garnetts: North should lead the A@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: this will clear things up for him|pg||
nt|garnetts: If he doesn't like that the A@H is a standout |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: north asking east....thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: Not an easy lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: have a great party thx for the brodcast and Good luck for the taj trip see you on Friday|pg||

nt|mango joe: 5@S shows Q@H i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
nt|mango joe: can he find out about Q@S?|pg||
nt|mango joe: he cant bid 7 with any surety|pg||
nt|mango joe: he knows abut K@D A@C and Q to four @hs|pg||
nt|mango joe: and he knows that N will have a bit more for his opening |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: hoping that partner has @sq also|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes but it will be on a hope rather than certainty|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ralfwil: I can understand the @s lead from E|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mango joe: or QJ@D to 4|pg||

nt|mrdct:  hard to see the formidables gaining here with australia having bid and made a game in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 8-card suits on S as well as N|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  perhaps it went fast at the end and he did not pitch all his diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if 3NT is a 4-level minor pre-empt, or a flawed solid suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: in the old days it was a running suit, but time has changed.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: hemant jalan  , leads alpha    75-0|pg||
nt|mango joe: wow!!|pg||
nt|mango joe: E/W likely to reach the unmakeable 3N|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|paulg:  difficult for East to move on, despite his controls|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@h is on a @s finess also 7@h|pg||
nt|mango joe: who won the final Ian?|pg||
nt|ian111:  both sides can make 10 tricks in a minor|pg||
nt|ian111:  which final ?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Hemant or Scotland?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Commonwealth Games Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzat:  Hemant Jalan leads Alpha by 75-0:   Arun Jain leads Magic Eyes( thailand) by 22:   Australia leads Formidables 51-19|pg||
nt|ian111:  Hemant |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ralfwil: This is a board, wher you have to choose betwenn 5 ot 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  it was close with about 8 boards to play, but ended up over 40 to Hemant|pg||
nt|mango joe: 2@H shows less than 4 points normally, its the weakest response|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulg:  if North would bypass a 4-card diamond suit to bid 1NT, as many would, then pass is an option that would not work out well|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but Duncan-Gordon are pretty old-school and so retreating to clubs looks sensible|pg||
nt|mango joe: India has a lot of depth in bridge, many ggod teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: satya checking opps conv card for lead explanation?|pg||
nt|mango joe: nothing to do with the suit|pg||
mb|3S!|an|puppet to 3nt|nt|mango joe: good|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mango joe: was 4@D forcing here? I think not|pg||
nt|ian111:  hard to stop, but a lack of Aces ...|pg||
nt|ian111:  3C usually FG|pg||
nt|mango joe: esp after S opens|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  there is little worse than leading a trump to cut down dummy's ruffs and seeing 3334 put down|pg||
nt|mango joe: only @C lead gives declarer a chance|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mango joe: he isnt thinking of ducking is he?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct:  west will try to tap dummy but to no avail|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ian111:  slight danger if CA led|pg||

pc|s4|nt|paulg:  claim easy 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|mrdct:  gill might ruff this to lead a @c through|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|ian111:  playing a small S rom dummy means E must cash the C (unless he plays the S9)|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||

nt|mrdct:  this will be 1 or 2 down i think|pg||

nt|ian111:  i thought so too|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes  12 x 3 |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: this set started with 15 as 1st|pg||
nt|mango joe: but this is 13th board|pg||
nt|ian111:  so why are we playing bd 25?|pg||
nt|mango joe: ah ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 15-  26|pg||
nt|mango joe: ok thanks|pg||
nt|ian111:  ah yes - 13/14 removed|pg||
nt|ian111:  looks like 4S -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|mrdct:  31 imps in 2 boards looks unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  needs a H guess and C finesse|pg||
nt|ian111:  could try 3NT and hope to avoid a H lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s on E or do you show a 2-suiter? |pg||
nt|paulg:  a slam swing on board 25 has given Hemant Jalan some breathing room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i show two-suiters these days|pg||
nt|mrdct:  pretty much need two double game swings|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  in my system, it would be 3@c to show non-strong spades and clubs|pg||
nt|mango joe: puppet|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  Duncan's bid depends on their methods after a reverse ... some play 2NT as artificial (with weak hands)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now E? do you regret only 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: yet to get a push board|pg||
nt|ian111:  not easy to bid the thin but good 5C|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  it would take a horrible defence to let NS make 5@d here - not that they are at all likley to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: arun jain 117- magic eyes 78|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|paulg:  3NT probably suggests a weak club stop|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Gordon has nowhere to go .. he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: usually the weaker hand bids the major he doesnt have |pg||
nt|ian111:  4S by E might make on CJ lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  are the results on the web anywhere?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: see hcl website|pg||
nt|mrdct:  both 5@c and 3NT depend on the @s hook|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  this should be beaten on a club lead, as long as West does not cover the @sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  given West's poor spade intermediates, this should be easy to avoid|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  this will play well with the doubleton club with north and the @d10 preventing a force|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c is much easier than 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Ian|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ian111:  hi |pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|paulg:  not an easy lead for East to read, although to beat the contract he has little choice about playing West for an honour|pg||
nt|paulg:  or playing West for 98xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: at least the @H guess was easier|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the HCL website only seems to have hte results up to round 9 of the swiss|pg||
nt|mango joe: he will know Q@S and a key card is missing so will stop in 5 probably|pg||
mb|6C|nt|vugraphzat: Aus vs Ind 1 for the silver and bronze medal.....Scotland have won the Gold Medal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Scotland has already won the Gold medal as the top national team in the event|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: 2nd 3rd place|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: all to no avail though|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1 to 12 boards ...than 15 to 26|pg||
nt|ian111:  4S made at the other table|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ian111:  2h might struggle too|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ian111:  S tried a small C at trick 2 after a H lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think bbo timetable was wrong - this started exactly one hour afer the advertised start time|pg||
nt|mrdct:  when is the restart?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mango joe: he will have no choice but to get @Ss right so i predict a make|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s4|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ian111:  i watched murdoch spears this morning and they were tired|pg||
nt|mango joe: so Poddars lead looking more unassailable now|pg||
nt|ian111:  it's been a long 10 days|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  as the cards lie, 5@d makes but tough to find when South says some of his values are in clubs|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cannot se any way to take 8 tricks |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|mango joe: have they reduced the boards for semis & final as well?|pg||
nt|mrdct:  of course in 5@c @s finesse not required if you can setup a long @h trick|pg||
nt|mango joe: maybe thats why they started later|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: and 10 tricks in @c|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mango joe: now @S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  once you've decided to overcall 1@s I think it's pretty impossible to play in clubs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  and if 2@d is Michaels and 2NT the lowest two suits, perhaps he had no option but to overcall 1@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, you should therefore show a 2-suiter on lowest level|pg||
