nt|psridhar: not a happy moment if you inadvertantly become a stepping stone in their bidding :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Bocchi congratulates himself now -- Madala is certainly not impressed|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|psridhar: Bocchi may feel better after he lands this grand now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|petergill: Previous board: Perhaps NS are not a regular partnership, if North's Pass of 1@S was based on the idea that Sotuh would have jumped to 2@S on his actual hand? |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 37 HCP - running 5 card suit - I exp 7 out of 8 pair in 7NT/7@s|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The Swedes had 6 rounds of bidding to the cold 7NT. Some of us would just bid 2NT  7NT. Too simple I suppose|pg||

nt|psridhar: it is important that Madala takes control since he can see 5 spd tricks with his holding after KCB and can count 13 in 7N|pg||
nt|pelu: in my bokk: 5@c = 1 or 4 Aces incl @sK|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|psridhar: Bochi can find out about @S QUEEN but cannot be sure of the Jack |pg||
nt|pelu: and a fast claim|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure everyone will be in the grand in a field as strong as this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But accidents happen|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 37 HCP and 5 running @s...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: "is @ss 5-0" asks Bocchi -- "No" is the answar -- then claim|pg||

mb|1H|an| |nt|sommer: small upgrade from N?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and south might do the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Auken-von Arnim  vs   Bertheau-Nyström|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like a normal 4 @S, but with open cards 3NT looks better to me|pg||
nt|thorvald: A partscore in @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: NS 2nd, EW 9th|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|Walddk4: Maybe 3@S now|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, they play 15-17, but the 5c is treated as 1 extra|pg||

nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
nt|roswolf: choice of games here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to David Bird|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec points out that the CC for NS can be found at http://1833.bridge.no.Helgemo_Helness.html |pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|roswolf: are the norwegians awake enough to bid this slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed thorvald|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|xenya: hello David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html  for standings after round 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was just looking through the VG records for this event. Several big boards yesterday.|pg||
nt|jtr: Thought you were away somewhere (exotic)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room eventually is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@c i imagine was Drury|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's singleton ace in partner's suit is not a good omen for bidding on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Probably not the best line to play anyhow|pg||
nt|peacokk: in the long run|pg||
nt|tez: zorlu assael have 9 card @h but very bad split|pg||
nt|roswolf: 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards. This is a match from round 12. Format is IMP-scoring.|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|ndemirev: S hand, despite the 14 count, is too slow. Passing 3d is very reasonable |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Roland. 4@d must be in no danger, so 3@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: MGrand possible - which will fail|pg||
nt|sommer: good game|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a club lead to break 4 of a major i think|pg||
nt|thorvald: An easy game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: this isnt best contract|pg||
nt|sommer: still makeable|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, 3NT much better|pg||
nt|roswolf: and duly reached|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|mamos: defence looks favoutite here|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia downgraded his @ss to 4 cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, Drury, you think.|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice to have 7 in case partner forgets:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: You are right|pg||
nt|andyv:  and that link seems to have a problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  (or I typed it wrong)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: flat hands are often disappointing|pg||
nt|sommer: if W takes the normal way in @C's, NS must hurry to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: something lower you think Povi?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Garner/Weinstein will let it through|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is ok;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is also a winner but difficult to spot|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|roswolf: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger and for standings after round 11 go to http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2733.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: with the diamond finesse working 13 tricks are there|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C 4-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: it wont be bid - of course|pg||
nt|jtr: Happens|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|roswolf: 4-0|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some pairs use Safe Drury.|pg||
nt|jtr: You are Mrs Bird perhaps?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade support, with clubs... just in case.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, but my wife is. Are you feeling OK?|pg||
nt|jtr: Some work sorting this one out|pg||
nt|thorvald: Any suggestions of how to play this ?|pg||
nt|jtr: You and sorry:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: But anyway nice to see some of the local players|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: just a question of how many - not enormously important at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|roswolf: My co-commentators for this match are Gabor Szots and Thorvald Aagaard.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sommer: got the chance there!|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry |pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: in grand u have 12 tricks by finess @cJ - but if decl start ruffing @Ds for the 13. trick he is down - only the finess for @dK will give him 13|pg||
nt|jtr: Tried to steal a @s trick|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still playing to get as many tricks as possible, i think he will play clubs next |pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is the most frigid of grands|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D i smaybe the only slam here that does not make|pg||
mb|7N|nt|sommer: not easy for S to shift from KJ6|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe these guys are world champs or something:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The scoring is IMPs so big pick up possible here for HeHe|pg||
nt|thorvald: on a heart continuation that is|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, his entries are getting tangled now|pg||
nt|jtr: The @d is quite effective in that regard|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, might be tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: he can afford 3 spade loosers, but its getting messy |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: as a spec observes 2nt- 7nt may be a sequence for us mere mortals|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Auken ask about the bidding and while Bertheau answer, Nyström takes pd cards and claim...|pg||
nt|thorvald: Yes, that is a practical sequence :-)|pg||
nt|cicus: sure. and I bet some pairs will bid it that way|pg||

nt|psridhar: this 4@h d1 also may be duplicated across many tbls|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 3@d = I have something in @ds|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT makes on a @D lead, fails on a club lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: wow - tx from Madala|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps Bocchi, with such soft values, might have tried 3NT over 3@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: underleading aces is not always good :) -- yesterday Peter Bertheau did it TWICE -- in the same board|pg||
nt|psridhar: Did Ventin not find any other attractive lead?  may be he thought Madala for his 2N will hv a bal hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 2nt was just explained as a Asking Trialbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hope all bridge students are watching. This is exactly why your teacher says that you must not underlead an ace against a suit contract. You may not score it later|pg||
nt|petergill: Much needed imps for the Italians who are running 2nd with 4 rounds to go|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|psridhar: to his credit, Ventin knew a dia towards dummy will be played soon and he will be required to decide on ducking,..may be he felt declarer may misguess if he leads one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Once in a blue moon you may strike gold by doing it, but as a general rule: don't|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H will make, but I'm not sure that this is the best line of play|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: look at the bidding: Madala sign of i 3@H over 3@D - very often he will be short in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Madala has the @s A nearly out of his hand -- but then he takes it back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and starts thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: Madala could not afford to play @SQ at Trick 2, as North would duck, then give partner a spade ruff when the finesse is repeated. |pg||

mb|2D|an| |nt|suketbombi: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S|pg||
nt|ndemirev: HIs hand was great in context |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is a match from round 6 and the last today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they're ok in 3NT, but 4@s looks likely|pg||
nt|pelu: just the opening Martens hoped to see :(:(|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: strong club, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  any 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=relay (I think), may be 20+|pg||
nt|peacokk: I guess they will end up in 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: The @c opening works well here lead wise|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: I had to improvise a lead. BBO doesn't accept claim before lead:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: can they get to 3nt by west?|pg||
nt|jtr: Or could have:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like 4@H to me depends on reading the @h right - or wrong because the right solution is the antipercentage one|pg||
nt|thorvald: This wasnt the right contract with that lead|pg||
nt|thorvald: in danish unfortunately|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Declarer has plenty of tricks.... but so do the defenders.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and a @c lead against 3nt hadn´t defeated if Welland had played  @cQ from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham and Raju Tolani|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: i think S should have read the @H position on the previous hand|pg||
nt|tez: need agrement here..whats dbl?t/o to @d or good @c's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and not 5@d either|pg||
nt|sommer: no chance, I guess|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe even -2 after small @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: if see LH open with both majors - u bid 2@S in S? - not me - but I am old :)|pg||
nt|sommer: could be wrong to pass too, but you are right, Peter|pg||
nt|thorvald: But now it seems safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: well not a good hand for PRC i agree|pg||
nt|jtr: Hard to bid 5@c here|pg||
nt|thorvald: Hard to see any way to make 4@H |pg||
nt|roswolf: well a revoke would help|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2@d was good @h raise|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sommer: in these zones, W may be very light|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: probably long suit, wekaish hand, and reasonable conclusion  |pg||
nt|mamos: standings after first two rounds of this strong tournament at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S would be second negative so 2@C shows some values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hence 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that may buy it|pg||
nt|andyv:  after W passed 1@s, the vul made it dangerous for E to further compete.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2727.html  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 1@s might not be to everyone's taste, but it has worked well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be so good as the previous one...|pg||
nt|thorvald: I like the lead, making the defense much more easy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|xenya: they found a nice spot|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sommer: yes, this will be easy - guess, it will be bid all over|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: not a hand of great interest  -- Butler style scoring I think  effectively imp Pairs    scored on 80-0 match basis|pg||
nt|mamos: ten boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: total imps across the field, two results scratched, with a cap at 40 imp  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pairs are given 40 imps so no negative scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't lose more than the 40 IMPs you have when you start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big scores in the last round:  80-0  77-3  and  71-7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South probably wants to bid, but he has no guarantee of a fit anywhere |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Screens are not in use|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 75 minutes to complete 10 boards|pg||
nt|pelu: ????????????????|pg||
nt|thorvald: Interesting, not place for any mistakes in the defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite so|pg||
nt|andyv:  not an easy hand to play from either side|pg||
pc|cK|nt|suketbombi: nice underlead by Bocchi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: yes but it is a misfit hand and i would therefore pass|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: Bet Zia got the 80|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sommer: now a @S trick can be promoted|pg||
nt|sommer: ..for W|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sommer: @C@C@C..@H..and @c|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzsh: Zia 73, but Nystrôm 80|pg||
nt|mdgraham: low trump?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bit bow and arrow if you ask me i like trial bids over a nat raise - std methods are often best|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: but no problem here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: It would have been a lot more interesting on a @c lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: for standings after round 6 go to http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2728.html|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|andyv:  E might pitch @h here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sommer: ..IF W had covered|pg||
pc|h8|nt|suketbombi:  will cash out for 120 to helness|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: unlucky, but likely to happen at all tables|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S -1 shud be par - unless transfer bids place the contract with East and @C lead|pg||

nt|thorvald: *now|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think more likely down 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 8 and 9 of spades are looking large cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there might be a moral here - opening weakish hands third-in-hand vulnerable against not may not be the best idea|pg||
nt|thorvald: Michale Askgård is a very carefull declarer, and one of the best in DK to master the odds - so I expect him to play the best line, but I can't realy see what that is atm|pg||

nt|petergill: Ventin is playing fairly swingy bridge in order to try to catch up to the leaders, being in middfield after 11 of 15 matches|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|pelu: one the first real psykes I have seen here in Copenhagen|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Gus Hansen would approve|pg||
nt|psridhar: what is that 1@h by Madala?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He won the Pro/Am with Tom Hanlon|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Zia made one against Zorlu-Assael on the first day -- but Zorlu-Assael bid a grand slam anyway - but went down one|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other BBO table, North decided not to psyche. I must admit - at the suitable vulnerability, I would have been tempted.|pg||
nt|pelu: but he didn't psyche ! only some check-raises :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 1@h=@s I think Bocchi explained at the table|pg||
nt|psridhar: ok -so Madala has bid @s and @d ..that makes sense|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interesting that South bid only once: suggests that he read the psyche|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Bocchi deduced that Madala would certainly bid 4@h over 3@S if he held @HA, and with @SK and @DK Madala would probably bid 4@D over 3@S|pg||
nt|pelu: if 1@c naturel then I would bid 2NT in S = 9-11 + @C-fit - and make life even harder for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C can be 2 I suspect|pg||
nt|petergill: If South reads the pyche as weakness with clubs, surely South would have upped the ante to 3@C or 4@C over 2@C?|pg||

nt|jtr: There are a few weak NTs around|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: He might be able to eliminate the hand though|pg||
nt|roswolf: normal or just a rubbish multi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@H   seems normal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Ns game here too - just a question of which one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT or 4@h|pg||
nt|sommer: at least one would be quite safe, imo|pg||
nt|xenya: E would have been squeezed on the last trump, yes|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 @H here|pg||
nt|sommer: only for one overtrick:)|pg||
nt|mamos: if 1NT is 12-14  may play ther|pg||
nt|jtr: He can get out with a  trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an| |nt|mdgraham: 2NT=12-13 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an| |nt|ndemirev: 4H is a normal destination here |pg||
nt|ndemirev: 6H could make double dummy |pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S shud fail with E as declarer as well previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: fourth highest of dummy's longest and strongest |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Lead 3.-5.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, fifth|pg||
nt|pelu: decl has to look for his 9. tricks in @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny heart position - suit is blocked. Of course South canot know that |pg||
nt|roswolf: but he may have to play for it in effect|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S misguesses @H think will fail if EW play passive defence|pg||
nt|pelu: look like !§D10 is the correct card - woring - then West easy can set up his @D - so 1. trick on @DK and then @D to 10 - to keep control|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H =p/c|pg||
mb|1H|an|strong or nat|nt|mamos: or not :(|pg||
nt|sommer: this may be American Stayman|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another thinnish game|pg||
nt|thorvald: But then restricted choice no longer apply i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2MA is better than 2@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy NS game on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well he would win in dummy and play a @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty for info|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|ndemirev: 3D  must show 5+H|pg||
nt|ndemirev: now Welland may find another bid |pg||
nt|suketbombi: we say sorry for Being late not being ahead of time:)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that 1NT NS is 14-16 - 2. time N open 1NT on 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Then ruff a @d and play trump  If Zia had Hxx he would be endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: Might have raised @cs here|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 tricks to start with|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be straightforward - a strong club system shouldnt get overboard|pg||
mb|2C|an|gf|nt|peacokk: Well played by Nyström, just a overtrick at stake here|pg||
nt|mamos: East has poor Spades  and knows declarer only has three minor cards|pg||
nt|sommer: S showed 4c@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: It was|pg||
nt|sommer: hi Søren:)..gl and well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: hi povl|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h was a sort of two-way shot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: yes..specs ask me..I am right..it is puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe they make something maybe we do|pg||
nt|cicus: when they open 1@C we won't undestand the bidding|pg||
mb|2S|an|5+!d + one shortnes|nt|thorvald: And a lot of possibilities to mare more :-)|pg||
nt|thorvald: *Make|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks hopeless|pg||
nt|pelu: spects tell: 15-17 - but Helness also open on 14 - seen 2-3 times here in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|sommer: is @H 3-3 with @HA right enough?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, they play 15-17.. but upgrades a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: still has to lose a club|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mamos: i expect @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT was an alternative, when holding both the red aces. But he might prefer West to play it, perhaps with some red queens.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ah well|pg||
nt|sommer: quite normal in US to jump to 3@C changing from normal to (Am)puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sommer: lucky @C's too..it MAY make!|pg||
mb|3N|an|!c|nt|pelu: but if they upgrade often - the syetm sh tell 14-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: 14-30 i guess |pg||
nt|ndemirev: this lead may tip Zia to actually making it |pg||
nt|sommer: I think it's ok to upgrade with 5c's or 10's/9's|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is almost a pure 50% but at this form of scoring a poor proposition imo|pg||
nt|roswolf: is this passable!?|pg||
nt|thorvald: My guess: 1@C = strong, 1@D negative, 1@H relay and West will be describing his hand, with 4 spades, 5 diamonds, 3-5 hcp, and East will set the final contract (4@S)|pg||
nt|cicus: NS may set the final contract :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: well 3NT can make even on a club lead, as North have no entries|pg||
nt|cicus: I think E is contemplating 6@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: more likely i agree|pg||
nt|cicus: probably knows full distribution of W|pg||
nt|roswolf: that wont be a success and as leaders why take a flyer!?|pg||
nt|thorvald: We have seen them bid very aggresively on slams, and with great success|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mamos: same sort of idea|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 1nt is flexible in their hands|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes specs have noticed 3NT makes|pg||
nt|thorvald: Hoping for 2 @d-honers blcoking|pg||
nt|brolucius: (2@C was game-forcing. The so-called two-over-one system).|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: what conclusion can Zia draw from this lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: We'll see :) this is Zia|pg||
nt|roswolf: conservatism usually works when holding a lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: this is a walk in the park..N will probably take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there might be a few NS pairs in 3NT here - particularly if North starts 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: Zia and his nose...|pg||
nt|roswolf: play should be very quick|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: West has one king or 2 Quens. "We know nothing about the jacks"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: a endplay against East will now work|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|thorvald: Now 12 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: now 6@C would have been more challenging...|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: west will come under pressure soon|pg||
nt|pelu: thats ok - but opp shuld be told |pg||
nt|roswolf: obviously the system has a flaw then|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sommer: @H@H now?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thorvald: 6@C is makeable, but not biddable i think|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sommer: E is endplayed in a strange way:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: @d and @h first?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, but S has no other option|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: if he cashes another spade now...|pg||
nt|xenya: missing an ace and the trump queen, but 9 trumps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|thorvald: Nah, still only 11 wrong position for the double squeeze|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

mb|3C|an|Invit|nt|mamos: EW may bid game and not  make it here|pg||

nt|thorvald: promising 4-card support, now Bocchi will bid the game|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should pass - well done|pg||
nt|thorvald: I used to play 2@S as non-forcing using Weak Jump Shift, but nowadays 3@c seems to be the only way out|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sommer: I for sure expected E to bid 2NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  I never care for bids where the weak hand takes pd out of 3NT range|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Nystrom-Bertheau made 6@H on board 21|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as they are playing against the second-placed pair, that won't do them any harm|pg||
nt|roswolf: invitational with that c*** -geez|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|sommer: this is a "walk in the park"|pg||

nt|jtr: Sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that easy to defend either|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems right to play a @h through now|pg||
nt|thorvald: No you will play clubs trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|jtr: And let partner play another @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's minor-suit honours may look of dubious value to him, but in fact they will prove useful. |pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: @d2 was Malmø|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: 3@H shows a singleton|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia is trying to shorten declarer so he cant use the @ds|pg||
nt|jtr: But i rather think Welland will get endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: One of those hands where you know the exact shape at trick one|pg||
nt|brolucius: When the opener raises responder's major, it is possible that he has only three-card support. It is therefore important to have some sort of continuation that allows you to check ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: how many cards he has for you.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|sommer: ..11?:)|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|jtr: 4@s went down on 11 at the other table|pg||

nt|brolucius: If Madala held only trhee-card heart support, he would bid something like 2NT or 3@C instead of 3@H. |pg||

pc|c6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sommer: was this good?|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like an easy one, yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: this might get too high|pg||

nt|cicus: awkward hand for N, many invent a 1@S response here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 6@h is ok now.but very hard to find|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia is very disciplined with his opening bids|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I know - but I never get any of those|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: the last three or four times Ive watched there have been loads of eight and nine cards suits  the dealing machine seems to have  the balanced box ticked today|pg||

nt|cicus: I like 2@C by a passed hand|pg||

nt|jtr: 2NT not perfect but expresses the values well|pg||
nt|thorvald: Well, showing 6-9 by agreement makes at lot more attractive :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have bid 1@S but they have a gadget - works here a treat|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|ndemirev: after this start it should be in play|pg||
nt|roswolf: a safe level|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: At matchpoints, North might bid 2@S. At IMPs he would be worried that partner could place him with a better hand. Stil, I think some players would bid 2@S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Partner cannot do much damage on a passed hand, even if he does think you have a better hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2@s would be @s+mi and 2@d is multi (NT-defense)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see. Thanks!|pg||

nt|Walddk4: That's not common in Chandlers Ford|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: @c2 in hand|pg||

pc|d3|nt|sommer: 2@H was USP, I think|pg||
nt|sommer: =good @Sraise|pg||
nt|sommer: USP is short for Usefull Space Principle|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of a psychological trial for EW here. You go off in a reasonable slam and game, and then the opposition bid and make three games in a row   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: First prize in this event is 50,000 Danish Kroner, around 7,000 Euro, US$ 9,500|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy to get the impression that it's not your day|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sommer: 23 hcp but makeable game|pg||
nt|thorvald: He needs to pick up the spades, and cant afford to duck the hearts, so its ace, play spades, with a finess of north and using diamonds as an entry|pg||

nt|sommer: ..but will E ever find @SQ?|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|brolucius: A diamond through the @DA (an avoidance play) will give him time to set up a spade too.|pg||

nt|psridhar: any reason why Madala didnt finesse?|pg||
nt|psridhar: other than the cunning low @h to 9 was attractive?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I can tell you all that Madala knows what he just has done --- He looks VERY VERY annoyed with himself -- Bocchi just shakes his head|pg||
nt|psridhar: Madala has plenty of flair and backs his instinct successfully ..there must hv been some 'vibes' at the tbl for that play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: the only vipes at the moment comes from Madala :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: we are blissfully ignorant of the table chemistry sitting away :)|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR N in 3@DX|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and they are not "good vipes" :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Madala thought South - a passed hand - has @DA or @DK (no @D lead) and @CKQ so no @HK due to no opening bid|pg||
nt|petergill: and that North - the doubler - had more cards. Good double by Ventin, we should say. |pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Would 4@SX have made if he ran the heart to the nine?|pg||
nt|psridhar: the event leaders have nicked a profitable 300 on this -that will hurt EW more |pg||
nt|pelu: very close - @H to 10 and @HA ruff by Nand discard a @C - now decl in control to ruff 2x in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: seems like 10imps for NS here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room is just one of seven comparisons|pg||

nt|ndemirev: there were no inferences as to the @H Q one way or the other |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: East claimed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do you have a new keyboard? Unlike you to use apostrophes.|pg||

nt|roswolf: but has been hijacked|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: sorry West thinking?|pg||
nt|pelu: and buy the board|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: Why lead @hs?|pg||
nt|jtr: Good question|pg||

nt|thorvald: What would 3 @S be then ?|pg||

nt|thorvald: West should lead a trumph |pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: I couldn't hear the explanation |pg||
nt|roswolf: x was tempting fate|pg||
nt|cicus: because it seems to me S expected more|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: X of 3@d was penalty:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: East knew keycards were missing|pg||
nt|peacokk: Nyström didn't cue a shortage in partners suit and they were at the same wavelenght, well done|pg||

nt|cicus: hehe|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: might make six on a non-club lead|pg||
nt|sommer: oooo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S would show around 8-10, in standard systems, but the fifth card in the major is worth at least 2 points extra.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html  for standings after round 9|pg||

nt|suketbombi: 2nt must be a supper accept and 3@D a retransfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was told 2Nt also announced a min hand in their methods|pg||
nt|suketbombi: every card working overtime and Q ( of @CS in will make 11 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: Zia wants to look at trick 1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: At the other table: Zorlu-Assael vs Bocchi-Madala|pg||
pc|h4|nt|thorvald: Does 2@D promise extra values as it suggest an offshape take-out double ?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 4S here is a desaster on the layout. |pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S by S is for me an overbid - max 3@D = invit with @s-support|pg||

nt|sommer: may go 3 light now, but it was still impossible to pun..imo|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|petergill: 6@C is adventurous but cold|pg||
nt|petergill: assuming you pick @CQ|pg||
nt|pelu: no @S9 back from S - then 4@S is down - as I see - agree?|pg||
nt|psridhar: last hand how do u make 4@H if S returns a trump at trick2? |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|psridhar: that will be the popular defense i guess|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@S = GF - no 4 card @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 2@s = 4+@c at least invitational values|pg||
nt|petergill: Previous board: Yes, I think you are right - @S9 switch beats 4@S, but on South's actual heart play, 4@SX could have been made, I think . I will stick with "EW plus" as datum.|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: TD sorted it out|pg||

nt|sommer: y, 150 will be common|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed david|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a momma papa slam|pg||
nt|jtr: Potential slam here|pg||
nt|jtr: Hmm not quite mmomma papa is it?|pg||
nt|thorvald: It seems the slam will go down, but I think it will be bid 15 vs 15|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he bids again|pg||
nt|brolucius: Normally he has to, unless he is a passed hand perhaps.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|sommer: (wasnt possible to get the beer..and the o.t.)|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy to bid and provided rightsided trivial to make|pg||
mb|d|an|Hi-Lo|nt|brolucius: 'Forcing to suit agreement' is a phrase that you often see.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2732.html  for standings after round 10|pg||
nt|cicus: quite light vul overcall|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsh: Bocchi want 6 cards more|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 5@C an excellent contract but if NV E-w will fight hard and get to 5@H wud be a bad result for them|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: can NS get to 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can all see 3NT is good - but South can't see the KQ to six|pg||
nt|pelu: but for sure  Nt better than 4@S - also every time @D are 4-3 - so I will take lucky back :) and just compliment Zia-Welland :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: h/h again frisky|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think they are playing High-low double here|pg||
nt|cicus: now how does N avoid playing in 4@H?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now he denies 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: EW are playing a system called "Nusine@C"|pg||
nt|thorvald: How will you make it on a @d-lead ?|pg||
nt|jtr: Transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Very useful if partner has Kx|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder why he did not bid 3NT immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, i think a helicopter is needed to reach dummy and make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Bocchi: He plays better?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is that a common method, David. I can't remember hearing about it before.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Weinstein: slower|pg||
nt|jtr: I have seen it before  maybe with this pair though|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: In my opinion E has to act and bid @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia: Bid 3@h pd|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w in 3nt?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..they were in 1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Jassem is thinking:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i know this is a TTASL position|pg||
nt|sommer: will Jassem realy raise now??|pg||
nt|sommer: dont think so|pg||
nt|pelu: Jelness could have passed 1NT out - now EW - with 26 HCP are close to 3NT|pg||
nt|sommer: E 1NT was too good|pg||
nt|roswolf: ttasl -TEACH THEM A SHARP LESSON|pg||
nt|sommer: he has 15..but 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: ie bid game and make it when you could have passed them out in partscore|pg||
nt|andyv:  another safe contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: lol mike i think she could|pg||
nt|sommer: 8 losers...|pg||
nt|jtr: Welland probably has one but i am not sure about Wrang|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think a @h lead is the only way to make it, but looking at west hand a heart might be the only way to beat it, knowing partner has an ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heliocopter might be available|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point thorvald|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, it might be necessary to set up a trick before partner's ace is knocked out|pg||
nt|roswolf: also welland is prone to this sort of play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: although she will shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will w]be good/bad news|pg||
nt|brolucius: Often played as a splinter bid.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: typical pairs action - pre-empt to the limit, then let the opponsnts sort it out. |pg||
nt|jtr: South has not shown his values yet|pg||
nt|jtr: He has now|pg||
nt|cicus: after this bidding his spades are even less tempting|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|suketbombi: now a trump?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: too late tho|pg||
nt|mdgraham: shouldn't matter - one spade ruff brings down the queen |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Think it required an initial trump lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: can set up @DS too while @Sak intact @Ds 3-33 or JX best chance|pg||
nt|pelu: again: we have a lots of spectators I like all the comment, but I dont like that there are so many "John Do's" - pl update your profil with name and nation - many commentators dont ...|pg||
nt|pelu: answer chat from thus "no-name" spects - please :):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a good start|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Bad/bad news?|pg||
nt|sommer: wow ...sryyyy|pg||
nt|sommer: that was strange:)|pg||
nt|sommer: imho|pg||
nt|pelu: only few boards to go - but in a long match that bidding will slow NS down a little :)|pg||
nt|jtr: OK All academic|pg||
nt|roswolf: anyway no real test now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: quite an unusual lead - @DQ must have been an option|pg||
nt|jtr: DB99 knows all these things|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@d here has to be competitive, otherwise South may get frozen out with a strongish balanced hand|pg||
nt|peacokk: Not much in the play here, we all would score the 9 obvious tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as to the suit quality (and length) required, well...|pg||
nt|cicus: safety play in clubs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: Nusine was Blaksets cat..I think:)..must be dead for years now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, diamonds are 3-3 and there are the entries to set them up|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no can set up @Ds in isolation|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can bid 2@S otherwise, hoping that partner can rebid NT.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|cicus: protecting @SQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: First prize in this event is 50,000 Danish Kroner, around 7,000 Euro, US$ 9,500|pg||
nt|thorvald: He can afford to loose that club, even though its hard to see a hand where West doenst have King of @S|pg||
nt|cicus: indeed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sommer: Tor will be unhappy with his 2@D:)..|pg||
nt|pelu: Martens can only see 8 tricks - but wjen he play @C - he will smile :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Only problem in 6@S is that Wrang has 4 hearts, so against the slam i think I would have lead the unbid suit - anyway this one will have no problems  11 trcicks ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: Oh|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sommer: answer to many: It wasnt the cat, who invented the system:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Thought he would overtake and finesse @c|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sommer: ..Lars did|pg||
nt|cicus: and 8 of spades also showed 4 small ones - as a spec tells me|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match now|pg||
nt|psridhar: u cant reach 6@c if u leap to 5@c in the auction right ? :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Jan, Peter x 2 and PS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 4@h ew here|pg||
nt|petergill: Reopen into their cold 4@H?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3|pg||
nt|pelu: now 3@Hs and 4@H by Bocchi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and again -- opps could have passed the 1@s bid|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H - 4@H? Is 5@D a good save?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that is double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't tell me that you would pass the South hand after 1@S pass pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: the italiens did it a few boards ago - and here is the "Thank you" from Wrang :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I would not|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is unfair to expect Wrang to pass on that hand :)  it will be "Deal record bidding ", as Roland puts it :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p!|nt|Walddk2: They don't have the hand records  .... yet|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure not - the 2@D reopening from Bocchi was on a bad hand - here its 100% to bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: u need to have the deal record for such actions|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: no -- and they cant see it on my screen :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass seems to be the start of a rescue operation|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: but nice result for the swedes at the other BBO-table|pg||
nt|petergill: Madala's Dbl might make 4@H harder to reach|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is worthwhile discussing that X by Madala there - a popular method is some shape ( not 19 HCP ) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedes had a gadget that made them bid the game|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@H  5-5 in the majors in a hand with no more than 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Bocchi explained the DBL as strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C was strong|pg||
nt|pelu: only down 1 = a fine save against 4@H :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: The TD has been called |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: because S explained the pass as forcing a RD by S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Wrang tells: "I must do whatever I like"|pg||
nt|petergill: Ventin might have been unable to explain if his Pass is part of a rescue or not - if NS are not a regular partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Bocchi is VERY VERY VERY UPSET !!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So one has to compliment Bertheau-Nyström for having a convention that shows this exact West hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: "You told me pass forced a RD --- and then you PASS" -- "Thats not ......"|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|petergill: I imagine Wrang said this out loud, as top experts have a habit of doing, even with screens|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|psridhar: meanwhile let us discuss the merits of that X - opener can have a min hand with shape, he can just bid, with shape and strength , X is better ?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c8|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|h3|pc|s2|pc|h8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 3@H is a standout and that West's Dbl of 1NT just gave NS space to bid their hands and obscured West's hand from East.   |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Wrang did tell everyone that PASS was telling him to RD|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|vugraphzsg: and I believe Bocchi thought that Wrang would RD|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2733.html  for standings after round 11 |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: But after his pass Wrang said "I can do whatever I wanted to do" -- "PASS is telling me to RDBL - but I choose to pass"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he said it forces redouble, but no-one can prevent him from passing|pg||
nt|petergill: Then Bocchi is wrong to be outraged.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is allowed to take a view|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats for the Diro to decide, but personally i think Wrang's pass is a legal bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Roland is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Bocchi leaves the table immediately .. not saying thanks for the game !!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: we will be back soon|pg||
mc|6|nt|Walddk2: Not so nice|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes|pg||

nt|petergill: Wrang was not wrong|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx all bye|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Bocchi sent the TD away from the table without asking for a ruling|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: so there is No Case :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just a grumpy Bocchi|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: Nort is going to use some room|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose if partner ALWAYS made their contract i would forgive a few overtricks:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would bid only 3@H with that suit.|pg||
nt|xenya: E will raise?|pg||
mb|3H|an|16-19 or playing st., 5-5 MA's, nf|nt|xenya: on 14, where EW went down in 2@S here, Madala in the other room managed to make 3N -- quite an achievement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you D on E or bid 1nt?|pg||
nt|ndemirev: you can click on "movie" to review the played boards|pg||
nt|sommer: like 2@S X made?:)|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@d may get them to 5@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: Make it KQ10xxxx and I might be as adventurous as you.|pg||
nt|xenya: via 4@D|pg||
nt|thorvald: Only 4@S is secured, and now the double fit have been revealed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the last round today we get to see Bocchi-Madala vs Bertheau-Nyström at the other table. What a match, second against first! In about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|jtr: And, as a spec noticed, 5@s goes down|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@D is a fit-showing bid - obvious when he is a passed hand, and probably the same even if he were not.|pg||
nt|thorvald: A new partscore, I guess 2@s will be the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: as yes. Didn't see the Norht hand.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT-3NT looks good|pg||
nt|brolucius: West will have a tricky decision what to lead against a high club contract.|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems a boring board|pg||
nt|cicus: they have a gadget to show this hand type|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: the made 3NT at least one table ("OR") in b14, where E passed 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup:)|pg||
nt|sommer: again we saw an upgrade..this time from E|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but the 3 10's are ok to evaluate it as 12|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: not really Povl :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: looking for 5 card major or else 3Nt i gues|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: not an exciting hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but 1NT=15-17, West investigates a possible club slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: now that is a view by north|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: i was about to say how should West make a slam try  he found a way|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical shot, 6@h - 7@H may be on but how to bid it if it is? |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: no unfriendly lies this time|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: might start with 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but sometimes it's not worth the strain|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the CC, it looks like West was finding out about a 5-card major|pg||
pc|s9|nt|suketbombi: yes that is what I thought|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be defeated - heart ruff, trump promotion on the @S10|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|tez: hi:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tes can make 11|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|thorvald: Some play 1@S showing a hand that can't preempt|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: Zia seems to have dropped|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: 6@D is a fair spot, but the 5-1 spade break might make 6@D difficult|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room eventually is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
nt|petergill: South is likely to push all the way to 6@d, I think|pg||
nt|psridhar: In 6@D East hand comes under the fork on a h to dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: On @HJ lead, East might end up squeezed|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6N may have been bid with a design of protecting the @h king|pg||
nt|petergill: after the fork, I mean|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all - just back from lunch - Hi :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead, on the theory that South is ready for a heart lead, would be dynamic|pg||
nt|psridhar: but 6N seems hopeless|pg||
nt|pelu: prob a neutral @D-lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|petergill: Great lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: makes defence a little easier when you produce good leads :)|pg||
nt|pelu: down now even if @s were running!|pg||
nt|petergill: No wonder Mme Lavazza in her recent interview had so many good things to say about young Agustin Madala|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||

nt|mdgraham: for some people, yes :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: refreshing to find someone not bashing a game|pg||
nt|roswolf: whem in doubt double for t/o and then try to work out where to play|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: that possible heart slam was bid on board 6 - unforunately, North was on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10-12|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 9 tricks for EW and 5 for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: all the spot cards making a difference here|pg||
nt|peacokk: EW might be in trouble now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not for the rest of us|pg||
nt|jtr: Careful to avoid 6 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  a quiet 3N?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: and now will h/h hustle here as well?|pg||
nt|jtr: We may see another type of 3@s bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers are saying that West should have gone to 5@H with his diamond fit.|pg||
nt|jtr: No|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they are.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup:(|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@d is @hs|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could bid 3@D with a stronger hand. His actual 3@S is pre-emptive.|pg||
nt|jtr: More @ds later i imagine|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: yes - this could end up in something doubled - no, South has come to the rescue|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: I am slow I still dont see how he maded 4@S? ruffed a @c and played @hK?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s looks sorta obvious|pg||
nt|roswolf: the americans dont do "obvious" quickly:)|pg||
nt|sommer: wasn't it --2, ope?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah had enough!?|pg||
nt|sommer: Søren?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Seeing the 2 hands NS what is your preferred contract ?|pg||
mb|2H|an|gf|nt|ndemirev: It will brobably be a partial |pg||
nt|jtr: Wow The leaders bid and made 6@h on 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@d forcing?|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems odd that it is|pg||
mb|3C|an|5-5|nt|sommer: wasnt 2N -2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: No @d conn|pg||
nt|roswolf: another bizarre bid by west - but there again what do i know!?:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, it's something doubled, anyway|pg||
nt|mamos: well  it came to something doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just not by EW|pg||
nt|sommer: tough, but makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: East took one @d|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sommer: the stiff @DK helps W|pg||
nt|suketbombi: to early for him to run the @H to T with so many chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most people hate leading from four to the jack - will South run it?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S/4@S 3@HS a @C + possible 2@DS may not run|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: It was easy?|pg||
nt|roswolf: to us palookas yes:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt|pg||
nt|cicus: 6 NT if no club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Unless 2@D was forcing to game.|pg||
nt|thorvald: He bid a free 2@H so he must have some values|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sommer: with @HAK in S, he may even score an overtrick..but I think, he will try to make 8 first:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now he can count 3 spades and 4 clubs and a diamond, when NS dont start ruffing @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Zia-Welland missed the game in 14 (6 imp)|pg||
nt|sommer: ahh, ok|pg||
nt|jtr: Well did he bod a free 2@h?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now showing a strong raise in @D - is 6D not where you want to be on any lead ?|pg||
nt|cicus: 4-3 spades is 62%|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he opted for the bid which was closest to his cards i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Welland ask ab lead|pg||
nt|jtr: bid|pg||
mb|4D|an|nat|mb|p|nt|ndemirev: 3D was a nice bid |pg||
nt|thorvald: Ofc depending on whether the transfer is showing values or just suit|pg||
nt|jtr: Advanatge of transfers there is that you can be weak or strong|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2@D is a transfer, that usually means that you are free to bid it on a weakish hand with hearts, as David implies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Madala is showing his @ss|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D otherwise|pg||
mb|4S|an|cue|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: Madala will dare not reyrn a @H:)|pg||
mb|4N|an|BW|nt|thorvald: with @hs 3-3 its makeable, but I don't think he will guess it|pg||
nt|ritong: double then @hs is not really attractive|pg||
nt|ritong: neither a direct 2@h|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@hs and exit @c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: But, as someone points out, 4@c maybe creates the game force|pg||
mb|5H|an|2A no !dQ|nt|mamos: EW clearly seem to have misjudged   not clear what South's 2@D showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2@d nat nf|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: return:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Helgemo has 10 6 in @h|pg||
mb|6S|nt|peacokk: Pass was probably forcing and DBL for penalties|pg||
nt|tez: defence has 6 trick in 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems not|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: now @SAKQ and @C's|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D is likely now i feel|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsh: yes|pg||
nt|peacokk: Pass by Nyström over 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: this is even better|pg||
nt|roswolf: commentators curse strikes again|pg||
nt|thorvald: Hard to find the @c lead in 6NT, but this is just doomed|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cicus: but an intelligent decision by Auken|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: east wont be happy until he sees pards @S10|pg||
nt|thorvald: Explain why you want to play 6@S and not 6@D ?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|cicus: I may miss something but I can see the same 12 tricks if spades behave|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: can make 9 by endplaying S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may play clubb to the Q now |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|mamos: South probably knew tha EW could not pass 2@D out|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|thorvald: exiting with a @s will still see him home as south wil be squeezed before declarer|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: WEll, if South could cash teh last @c it wouldnt work|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sommer: @SJ and small @H:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so nine tricks in clear view|pg||
pc|sK|nt|suketbombi: yes He has unblocke @H8 i was told:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzsg: maybe he thought his partner has made a bad lead for a while :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We will get comparisons from the other room when we circle back to board 1 after this board|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: if that 1@s was NF, then South was worth more|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Bocchi asks Ventin about the bidding -- and I think the speak Spanish together|pg||

mb|2D|mb|d|mb|3D|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: Bocchi is shaking hands with himself -- thanking himself for not passing |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: Perhaps Norberto Bocchi's bare king makes his hand too weak to reopen. |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bocchi had a 6-4 shape, always gud playing potential, but here his balancing act gave oppo another bite at their vul game|pg||

nt|brolucius: 20 opposite 4 does not play as well as 12 opposite 12, because you cannot move backwards and forward so easily.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is a transfer to 2NT if opener has 19-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he hasn't he bids something else|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsh: all alerted|pg||
nt|roswolf: well interesting sequence|pg||
nt|pelu: remember 2@H making by Helge - Bocchi-Madala bid and maded 3NT - a lot of right placed cards -: finess for @SJ - need 2 entries to dummy for the double-finess in @H |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the italians walked on water on that one|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sommer: this 2@C is (in Italy at least) called Gazzilli|pg||
