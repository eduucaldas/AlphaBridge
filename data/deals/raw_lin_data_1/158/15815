mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I suspect the stiff will be the normal lead|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|heyz:  West has an easier lead than East vs @s contract|pg||
nt|bt: u have 2 know ur opps to duck that in dummy|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - and the question is how many try to take a double advantage (that isnt there)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|heyz:  solves any lead problems|pg||
nt|bt: now the question is, does north know his pds style?|pg||

nt|henryb:  I feel sure that he does|pg||
nt|heyz:  kib says this could be misinterpreted as t/o for @ss|pg||
nt|bt: a guess?|pg||
nt|heyz:  the dbl|pg||
nt|jbgood: that must be an odd interpretation - this is a normal suit showing double|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: N asking E what the double means. East stating, I am not sure.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: heavyweight 2NT overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrk: 3@d not alerted|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|xenya: hardly a takeout -- W could double before|pg||

nt|mrt2000: 3NT doomed, I fear|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|mrt2000: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|tejjyid: So, do you assume transfers are safe in undiscussed auctions?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: could hsve been much worse  though|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d bad weak 2 in a major or balanced 23/24|pg||
nt|peachy: he can take his eight and give up|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I personally think it's crazy, but I observe myself to be in a minority|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I'm with you  :)|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps without the misunderstanding, they would play in 4H|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H practically laydown, and they're in 3NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also, you have to assume if your system is 4 card majors, strong NT, that you are heavily oriented to natural bids|pg||
nt|peachy: NS sat down just before gametime and made a card, I was told. They dont usually play together (although did play in Norway sometime in the past)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This is actually an interesting question in big pickup environments like BBO, where you rarely have detailed discussions|pg||
nt|peachy: I make the blanket agreement with all partners that systems on, makes life simple|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and avoids mistakes like this too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Artur in the tank|pg||
nt|peachy: it has some flaws but avoids misunderstandings|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, system on covers a multitude of situations|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb:  West still has to find the @c shift|pg||
nt|jbgood: a very careful 3@s - but 3@d bid got defense to a nice start - conventions sometimes give away leaddirecting doubles|pg||
nt|henryb:  otherwise declarer can still make five|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Artur may surface and make the best of it, I think !   lol|pg||

nt|heyz:  agree|pg||
nt|xenya: S will get two more trumps and a diamond -- at least|pg||
nt|bt: and now east is endplayed|pg||
nt|peachy: there is also an inference that a 1D overcall that takes away no bidding room from oponents, can be potentially a very good hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|heyz:  two round of @D|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h5|nt|bt: south can get out a spade|pg||

nt|tejjyid: i don't think that inference is particulalrly valid, although I know it's popular|pg||

nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|bt: maybe a few 200s so average+ ew?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: just look again how the auction wpold have gone if Artur has passed throughout|pg||

nt|bt: that was interesting, lol|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean S ruffing small|pg||
nt|jbgood: if you remember brd 13: only 4 pairs got 9 tricks in spades - one pair being in 6|pg||
nt|bt: polowan now honorary swede|pg||
nt|heyz:  discarding would have wrked as well|pg||
nt|xenya: that is certainly plus for EW, but not average|pg||
nt|heyz:  also pointed out by Phil Clayton That Morgan could have ducked the heart at trick 1|pg||
nt|bt: ducking was deep if south has 3@H|pg||
nt|bt: kathy|pg||
nt|jbgood: 300 not good on the first one, so round may be average (+) for the swedes|pg||

nt|bt: 600 will be a nice score, noone will play like that|pg||
nt|henryb:  not so unreasonable on the auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess you all want an update on the standing - give me 5|pg||
nt|henryb:  always Jon|pg||
nt|heyz:  Johannesens, Hinze, Connie Goldberg, JoAnn Sprung, Daniel Lavee|pg||
nt|henryb:  eight boards to go|pg||
nt|bt: and with excitement we await jon|pg||
nt|henryb:  Which do you all think is the more important event? The World Pairs or the Rosenbloom?|pg||
nt|bt: pairs since it is the only pair wc|pg||
nt|bt: we have olympiad and bermuda bowl for teams|pg||
nt|bt: but i am in a minority no doubt, as usual, lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  The World Pairs was the original reason for this tournament, but the Rosenbloom, which began in 1978, seems to be gaining|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the Pairs should be more important|pg||
nt|bt: thx henry, lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  And I think they should shorten the Rosenbloom so it ends before the Pairs SF begin|pg||
nt|bt: true also, why the free tickets to the finals|pg||
nt|henryb:  How many players do you think have won the Pairs, the BB the Olympiad and the Rosenblum?|pg||
nt|bt: hmm good q|pg||
nt|henryb:  And what player do you think has won the most different WC events?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Fantunes have not won the Rosenblum|pg||
nt|bt: fantoni nunes havent?|pg||
nt|bt: that was my guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  Martel and Stansby have won all four, and Stansby has the World Seniors as well|pg||
nt|bt: martel-stansby won the rosenblum?|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes|pg||
nt|bt: but never the olympiad?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I believe so|pg||
nt|bt: i wouldnt think|pg||
nt|henryb:  the Olympiad also|pg||
nt|bt: i bet 1 $, thats not much now|pg||

nt|jbgood: Mihov - Stamatov 4th, Fantunes 5th, Hurd - Wooldridge 6th|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jgc: To answer Henry's questions: NO ONE has won all 4 - Chagas, Branco, Hamman and Meckwell have won 3 with a 2nd in the Rosenblum. A number of other players have won 3, including ...|pg||
nt|jgc: Jais-trezel,Stansby-Martel. Wolff has won 5 or 6 different WBF World Championships.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|jgc: Michael Golden got it - they both have ex-spouses who are the offspring of Nobel Prize winners.|pg||
nt|bt: i would cue w north hand here, 3@H is an underbid|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 hearts strikes me as odd - isnt 2@s a good raise all over today?|pg||
nt|bt: jon you are slow, but yes i agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jbgood: or he is just degrading his spade holding . rather sensible|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: 1 IMP at stake here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2NT 21/22 (again), 3@s shows 3@s (according to Sarah)|pg||
nt|peachy: Finally, thanks to all our spectators for watching and for providing bit of information and comments on the play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think North is a little weak for 2@s. the @sKJ cannot get full value after the opening bid|pg||
nt|bt: my opps sometime open without AQ in their suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: but not right this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrk: But not David|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: But if it did then 3Nt would be a slam try with no shortage!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bt: its not like 2@S will get you to game automatically|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a pretty good idea to let 3@S show a fit and 3NT deny one|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tricky to decide if a singleton ! is shortage or not|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tejjyid: Q|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right, you can't stop in 3@S if opener has a doubleton, but how often do you want that?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: arguably it's more use as a Q than a singleton|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  true. but sometimes their partners are very short|pg||
nt|jbgood: much too often your "bad" holding in an opp's suit turns out to be good|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  170 surely|pg||
nt|bt: he claimed 10 very likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes, S claimed for 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|bt: someone suggested 2N over 2@H and i like that|pg||
nt|heyz:  that might get you to 3N down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|bt: it doesnt work but its an alternative if you want to express hand value and spade holding|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 nt showinng 4 crd supp I might accept, natural - not my cup of tea |pg||
nt|tejjyid: Right Roland, who stops below game after 2NT?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|c3|nt|tejjyid: it's really a huge punt that only 3@S is the right contract|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|c4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|s8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: That's why I think it's important for responder to know if there is a fit or not when s/he transfers|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
mc|12|nt|tejjyid: It's a very worthwhile investment; the occasionaly crazy game for more good slams|pg||
