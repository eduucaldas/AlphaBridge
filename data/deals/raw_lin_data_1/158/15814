nt|neobas: I think most of us would be in it still though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it begs the question of how to bid 6-4 hands, here a 2@H rebid would have worked better|pg||

nt|peachy: there is advice existing that with bad hand 6-4, rebid the major insted of showing the 4-card minor|pg||

nt|athene: firstly they would be blocked and secondly west might have an entry in @HA anyway|pg||
nt|daman: with apologies to Tarzan|pg||
nt|athene: the problem here is that if you play for the drop and it's wrong, you might lose the whole suit ( no  dummy entry)|pg||

nt|daman: my Mom would play the Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a matter of two tricks, down 1 or +1|pg||
nt|athene: he might be trying to work out if possession of @DQxx would make east more or less likely to find this odd lead|pg||

nt|henryb:  Johnson has great faith in Meckstroth. But this is abid against the LAW. His side must have only eight @s, and the opponents are likely to have only eight @h, so the three level should belong to them|pg||

mb|3S|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|heyz:  need to figure out how to blackwood on this hand|pg||

nt|fabsayc: except when i played there was cheaper minor for takeoout over 3 preempts, and double for PENALTY|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Its meaning is becoming evident|pg||
mb|p|nt|heyz:  or turbo for italians :)|pg||
nt|bt: 1@C is 10-12 or 17+ unless they changed, the "swedish club"|pg||

nt|athene: the interesting play is when as a defender you don't attack the spades there because that would force declarer to go "all or nothing"|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a partscorish hand now|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: so you save an imp by giving him a safe play for 11 when you see the 10 or 12 play will produce 12|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lead important here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you would like another queen or so|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: 4@S seemed pretty unilateral imo|pg||
nt|athene: 6-4 looks normal enough doesn't it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A club lead would not have beeen so good for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: if you have 64 and partner raises you, you bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meckwell style|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid game and try to make it|pg||
nt|sommer: sure, 4@S is obvious|pg||
nt|daman: a modest approach might have been to make a game try in @Cs?   Doing things the old fashioned way?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But when did East promise 4-card support?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: you could make a game-try, but there is a danger then that partner might bid only 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play 5-card majors, not Acol|pg||
nt|sommer: wouldnt we all jump to 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: the danger is not high with this partner, admittedly, but still it's there|pg||
nt|daman: Kokish would recommend a game try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Me too, 4@S|pg||
nt|daman: with a plethora of losers|pg||
