nt|iceking: NS are very active and agressive |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like it, but ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Bridge is for bidders -- thats what my partner tells me -- but :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italians do it all the time and they win a lot. So it's probably the right approach|pg||
nt|iceking: its really tuff to play against them, have been murdered by these 2 often not a pleasant feeling:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|iceking: if 1nt is 12-14hcp i think Helness could invite here |pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzsg: He thought about it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S10 is a great card and the finesse is marked|pg||
pc|h3|nt|iceking: even 3nt i think is fair |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|iceking: and the T9 of @C could have some values|pg||
nt|davpro: left alone in the bidding EW would have bid 3N...that's what is good with agressive bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anybody bid 2@H with East hand instead of Dbl?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|iceking: i cant see me doing that so answear is no|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is obviously the problem with an overcall like this. Partner may play you for a suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|c6|nt|iceking: for sure |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|iceking: but i like it anyway |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo could have done it anyway, and would have, but now it was easy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Give W another point or two you may have to|pg||
nt|iceking: @S is the boss suit bid it everytime possible |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: now Helgemo shows his cards -- claiming some tricks -- it is 9|pg||

nt|mdgraham: There are eight tables in play, so the result you see from the other room is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a @c return from W and only 11 tricks.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: club or spade lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may go for a club, as only one honour card needed from partner - which, of course, he hasn't got|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: 2NT is presumably forcing - a modern-ish treatment |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s2|pc|dJ|nt|geot: Heart from west is best now|pg||
nt|geot: or ells declarer will ruff a club and lose only one club and two trumps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead seems better for the defence. looks makeable now|pg||
nt|geot: If Bjarnarson switches to a trump, declarer is in trouble unless he plays low from north|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree, but declarer can play low |pg||
nt|geot: Difficult choice for Bocchi|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|geot: wd|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: and now West can simply cash out|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: In myb  opinion the only way|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|geot: if he plays the king he need spade to be 3-3|pg||

nt|iceking: i have no words from agressive to very passive|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: So another missed game, but this time more expensive because N-S are vulnerable|pg||
nt|davpro: random?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|iceking: well they might play 2@D as very week multi is that possible|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|davpro: Could it be a bidding missunderstanding? RD = bid your suit. 2@s ment as forcing, nat?|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|iceking: i doubt that |pg||

pc|s3|nt|geot: Another game that will make, three games in a row for the Italians|pg||

nt|iceking: Boye might have just got a blind spot happens to us all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: "You were goooood" says Helness |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: to Brogeland|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think Boye intended it as forcing Roland|pg||
nt|iceking: with @D ace for sure onside hard to imagine hand from N 4@S has zero play|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Maybe you can't get to dummy to lead a diamond up|pg||
nt|iceking: so 2@H here sound |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I guess they are playing 2@d = VERY weak multi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D was a weak weak 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and 2@h as a better suit --- my guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They do|pg||
nt|iceking: like i said even vs some very weak multis hands like xx Atxxxx xx xxx on none trump lead you make 5|pg||
mb|2N|nt|davpro: kQJT8x isn't that weak...|pg||
mb|d|nt|iceking: so vul no matter how you think about it Boye should have just bid game |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 14.20 Danish time, in 1 hour and 20 minutes|pg||

mb|3C|an|7-10 4!h or 8-10 3!h|mb|4D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so this could be at least 790|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|geot: South has some values and a partner who overcalled at the 3 level. Not unreasonable to double?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d is a good save|pg||
nt|pelu: the 3 IMP = 5@cX - 300 against 4@s|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzsh: K for count and A for att|pg||

nt|Walddk4: His hand is unusual|pg||

nt|pelu: even 5@s down on @C-lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@c down 1½ :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Interesting point from kib - if West is going to bid again, what about 4NT to bring diamonds into the picture?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: can NS have a slam after pass from S? or immediately bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|pelu: when pd has support for @C and 4NT only give opp informations|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Blakset left the table. Short break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The format is IMPs Across the Field; top and bottom scores are removed.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which was just as well in the last round, when one pair went for a 1600 penalty :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should have been 2200|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Blakset is back but Bocchi is still thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: after @SA (against 5@c) many would play 1D and then a @D-ruff to S = down 2|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: With @hK on S there areonly 2 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Bocchi-Madala against Blakset-Røn in round 2 at this table. In the other room we have the Norwegian clash, Helness-Helgemo vs Brogeland-Sælensminde|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you all see north´s hand as an 1@h opening? |pg||
