nt|stewball: there are not many shy bidders in this field.....|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible to see people wandering into game in various ways but it certainly won't be universal|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 1@S opening i assume |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: EW play 10-12 notrump only first and third seat, favourable|pg||

mb|p|nt|stewball: 3nt looks best|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: declarer's only concern here is the trump suit|pg||
nt|iceking: 3nt w best spot Zia-Welland bid it |pg||
nt|athene: how do you play these spades for two losers?|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Amos, Povl Sommer and Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so we´ve got the 1st and 2nd pairs|pg||
nt|xenya: They were 1 and 2 after Round 3|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hello Tez|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia is 1 with 212 and Zorlu is 2. with 192|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sommer: small upgrade from N?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and south might do the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Auken-von Arnim  vs   Bertheau-Nyström|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like a normal 4 @S, but with open cards 3NT looks better to me|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: Maybe 3@S now|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, they play 15-17, but the 5c is treated as 1 extra|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: We will get names up soon|pg||

nt|mamos: my brain needs start up time  but cant see 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|peacokk: A squeeze |pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
nt|roswolf: choice of games here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: are the norwegians awake enough to bid this slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed thorvald|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Probably not the best line to play anyhow|pg||
nt|peacokk: in the long run|pg||
nt|tez: zorlu assael have 9 card @h but very bad split|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: S hand, despite the 14 count, is too slow. Passing 3d is very reasonable |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Roland. 4@d must be in no danger, so 3@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: MGrand possible - which will fail|pg||
nt|sommer: good game|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a club lead to break 4 of a major i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: this isnt best contract|pg||
nt|sommer: still makeable|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, 3NT much better|pg||
nt|roswolf: and duly reached|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: defence looks favoutite here|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia downgraded his @ss to 4 cards|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: flat hands are often disappointing|pg||
nt|sommer: if W takes the normal way in @C's, NS must hurry to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: something lower you think Povi?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Garner/Weinstein will let it through|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is ok;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is also a winner but difficult to spot|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamond finesse working 13 tricks are there|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C 4-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: it wont be bid - of course|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: 4-0|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: just a question of how many - not enormously important at this form of scoring|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sommer: got the chance there!|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry |pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: in grand u have 12 tricks by finess @cJ - but if decl start ruffing @Ds for the 13. trick he is down - only the finess for @dK will give him 13|pg||
nt|jtr: Tried to steal a @s trick|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still playing to get as many tricks as possible, i think he will play clubs next |pg||
pc|d7|nt|sommer: not easy for S to shift from KJ6|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe these guys are world champs or something:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The scoring is IMPs so big pick up possible here for HeHe|pg||
nt|thorvald: on a heart continuation that is|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, his entries are getting tangled now|pg||
nt|jtr: The @d is quite effective in that regard|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|thorvald: he can afford 3 spade loosers, but its getting messy |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: Well, maybe 5@D can go down on a club lead, but East would never find that|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt and 5@d was makeble..5@c beats only @c lead (may be)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes, 13-15 NV v V|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: 2nt = 4+@hs at least invitational|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT at least invitational with 4-card support|pg||
nt|athene: you might lose a trick in each suit here perhaps on a club lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 3@c=minimum|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: @S lead or|pg||
nt|iceking: looks normal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably won't learn enough about east's hand to count his points and work out he can't have a heart honour|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: so he might well play restricted choice wrong in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
nt|iceking: shows how stupid iam:)|pg||
nt|athene: it might be a position where west must drop the queen rather than the jack on the first round of trumps because east can be counted not to have the @HQ (no 1NT opener) but he still ...|pg||
nt|athene: might have the @HJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good lead but he is OK if he ducks|pg||
nt|iceking: now there is a break for the def|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East can't attack spades|pg||
nt|athene: it all depends how much declarer learns about the hand before he tackles trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't the heart guess for the overtrick?|pg||
nt|iceking: could have won with the K here i doubt Fredrik will have many entries|pg||
nt|athene: there's a case for winning the first club with the king|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west is known to be very weak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think trumps matter, Bill|pg||
nt|athene: partners who aren't bringing any defensive tricks to the party ask for nothing better than to be deceived :)|pg||
nt|athene: you think declarer will have a black-suit squeeze anyway?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: I am saying that you make 11 tricks if you guess hearts|pg||
nt|stewball: oops|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 if you don't|pg||
nt|stewball: trump was his best shot|pg||
nt|athene: why shouldn't you lose a trick in each suit?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|stewball: now he will play to his @s Q|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|athene: east could have played ace and another diamond there|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|stewball: Peter has duck soup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did they miss a slam? :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|athene: ducking is often a good idea, just not today|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Well, 14 balanced with @SQx. I understand pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S|pg||
nt|ndemirev: HIs hand was great in context |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is a match from round 6 and the last today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they're ok in 3NT, but 4@s looks likely|pg||
nt|pelu: just the opening Martens hoped to see :(:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: strong club, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  any 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=relay (I think), may be 20+|pg||
nt|peacokk: I guess they will end up in 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: The @c opening works well here lead wise|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: can they get to 3nt by west?|pg||
nt|jtr: Or could have:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like 4@H to me depends on reading the @h right - or wrong because the right solution is the antipercentage one|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: and a @c lead against 3nt hadn´t defeated if Welland had played  @cQ from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham and Raju Tolani|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: i think S should have read the @H position on the previous hand|pg||
nt|tez: need agrement here..whats dbl?t/o to @d or good @c's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and not 5@d either|pg||
nt|sommer: no chance, I guess|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe even -2 after small @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: if see LH open with both majors - u bid 2@S in S? - not me - but I am old :)|pg||
nt|sommer: could be wrong to pass too, but you are right, Peter|pg||
nt|thorvald: But now it seems safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: well not a good hand for PRC i agree|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sommer: in these zones, W may be very light|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: probably long suit, wekaish hand, and reasonable conclusion  |pg||
nt|mamos: standings after first two rounds of this strong tournament at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S would be second negative so 2@C shows some values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hence 3NT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2727.html  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 1@s might not be to everyone's taste, but it has worked well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|xenya: they found a nice spot|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sommer: yes, this will be easy - guess, it will be bid all over|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: not a hand of great interest  -- Butler style scoring I think  effectively imp Pairs    scored on 80-0 match basis|pg||
nt|mamos: ten boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: total imps across the field, two results scratched, with a cap at 40 imp  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pairs are given 40 imps so no negative scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't lose more than the 40 IMPs you have when you start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big scores in the last round:  80-0  77-3  and  71-7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: Screens are not in use|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 75 minutes to complete 10 boards|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice underlead by Bocchi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: yes but it is a misfit hand and i would therefore pass|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: Bet Zia got the 80|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sommer: now a @S trick can be promoted|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In 45 minutes|pg||

nt|roswolf: normal or just a rubbish multi?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: 4@H   seems normal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Ns game here too - just a question of which one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT or 4@h|pg||
nt|sommer: at least one would be quite safe, imo|pg||
nt|xenya: E would have been squeezed on the last trump, yes|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 @H here|pg||
nt|sommer: only for one overtrick:)|pg||
nt|mamos: if 1NT is 12-14  may play ther|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ndemirev: 4H is a normal destination here |pg||

nt|sharkey: 4@S shud fail with E as declarer as well previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: fourth highest of dummy's longest and strongest |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Lead 3.-5.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, fifth|pg||
nt|pelu: decl has to look for his 9. tricks in @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny heart position - suit is blocked. Of course South canot know that |pg||
nt|roswolf: but he may have to play for it in effect|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S misguesses @H think will fail if EW play passive defence|pg||
nt|pelu: look like !§D10 is the correct card - woring - then West easy can set up his @D - so 1. trick on @DK and then @D to 10 - to keep control|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H =p/c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: or not :(|pg||
nt|sommer: this may be American Stayman|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another thinnish game|pg||
nt|thorvald: But then restricted choice no longer apply i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2MA is better than 2@d|pg||

nt|jtr: Maybe they make something maybe we do|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|roswolf: this looks hopeless|pg||
nt|pelu: spects tell: 15-17 - but Helness also open on 14 - seen 2-3 times here in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|sommer: is @H 3-3 with @HA right enough?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, they play 15-17.. but upgrades a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: still has to lose a club|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mamos: i expect @d|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos: ah well|pg||
nt|sommer: quite normal in US to jump to 3@C changing from normal to (Am)puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sommer: lucky @C's too..it MAY make!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: but if they upgrade often - the syetm sh tell 14-17|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ndemirev: 14-30 i guess |pg||
nt|ndemirev: this lead may tip Zia to actually making it |pg||
nt|sommer: I think it's ok to upgrade with 5c's or 10's/9's|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mamos: same sort of idea|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 1nt is flexible in their hands|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sommer: 3NT EW seems like the contract now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Defense spoiled dec plan by giving the contract:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: 3NT easy game here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the trick is not to be carried away here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 2N!|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: only 26 hp:)|pg||
nt|ndemirev: The slam was not good a pecentage but it paid off well. They must pick up a huge swing on the hand|pg||
mb|r|nt|mdgraham: NS 10-12 NT 1st/2nd - no upgrade here|pg||
nt|peacokk: 1@D 11-13BAL or 4@S/@H 4+@C/@D|pg||

nt|jtr: But you block the @ds taking the finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: Sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that easy to defend either|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems right to play a @h through now|pg||
nt|thorvald: No you will play clubs trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|jtr: And let partner play another @d|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sommer: 9 or 10 |pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: probably nine tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: EW lucky -- this time|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but he didnt like his 6 loser hand|pg||
nt|mamos: on previous board NS bid game on 24 withoiut blinking  seems very odd auction this board|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu: Zia follow the same plan as Helness - and will be down 1|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact the last thing the defence want is an early @d ruff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: 3@H shows a singleton|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia is trying to shorten declarer so he cant use the @ds|pg||
nt|jtr: But i rather think Welland will get endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: One of those hands where you know the exact shape at trick one|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sommer: W will have an open @C finesse now for 11|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ndemirev: this should make on normal play |pg||
pc|s4|nt|thorvald: Non-vulnerable you don't have as good odds for bidding borderline games|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sommer: was this good?|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like an easy one, yes|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there is a handling problem with both majors breaking badly|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Zorlu might be able to tell the exact shape of the defenders' hands after this trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think @sQ had been better than @s9|pg||
nt|ndemirev: at least it will be a fair assumption |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ndemirev: So all will depend on how he plays the hearts |pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: play @sK|pg||
nt|ndemirev: K here will kill dummy |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|xenya: nos S can get a @D ruff -- down 1!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: Welland needs to be careful about being endplayed|pg||
nt|thorvald: He cant ruff this one, but let partner ruff the next @D|pg||
nt|jtr: Another @s would have effected that|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: and that´s why W should have played @sQ|pg||
nt|ndemirev: looks down now i think|pg||
nt|xenya: so the @SQ was MUCH better -- now or earlier|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: If he ruffs this and exits with the @cK the defence are stuck|pg||
nt|jtr: If Zia overtakes he ruffs|pg||
nt|jtr: If not he pitches a @h|pg||
pc|cA|pc|sJ|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: 2@C = Gameforce relay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now one million relays and zz's I think|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: anyone in the audience most welcome to message me if they know the bids in detail|pg||
nt|iceking: if they bid this slam i have a feeling they will be the only pair in the field|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D = non-mimum strength with singleton diamond|pg||
nt|athene: they use AKQ = 321 instead of HCP count|pg||
nt|iceking: well i have a feeling Roland is right hard to see Fredrik stop now|pg||
nt|athene: so "non-minimum" means 8-10 on that count|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I will try to do it - if the players explains the bidding at the table|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Here we have Per-Ola Cullin|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: and they might have as few as 5|pg||

nt|athene: so even with only 11 hcp they are not treating it as a minimum|pg||
nt|pocken: 3D = 8-10 zz 0-1 D, 4+ Cl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A = 3 z   K = 2   Q  =  1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Pocken, please tell us about the upsides of playing  zz's compared with the 'normal' 4321 scale|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|athene: mainly the issue is whether to try to ruff two diamonds in dummy|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||

pc|d8|pc|s8|pg||
nt|pocken: Aces are proportionally higher valued|pg||
nt|pocken: Jacks are less important when in the slam zone|pg||
nt|pocken: And, skipping jacks makes room two show the exact honor location relay-wise|pg||
nt|pocken: to* not two|pg||
nt|athene: declarer also has to consider whether to finesse trumps:- that would be wrong if north could win from @HKxx and give his partner a ruff of course|pg||

nt|xenya: so the problem was not to bid 6 but to avoid bidding 7|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there were no inferences as to the @H Q one way or the other |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: East claimed|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ndemirev: One could argue Zia did open the bidding but that doesn't mean much |pg||
mb|1N|an|semiforcing|nt|xenya: of course he was playing to make|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looking like a 3NT that will go down on a @h-lead|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sommer: 4@H sonn for S|pg||
nt|jtr: Welland operating|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: but otherwise it looks a normal 4@H contract|pg||
nt|ndemirev: So declarer did well to go with the apriori chances|pg||
nt|xenya: great set for Zia/Welland so far|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the last round today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 tomorrow, 4 Sunday|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..soon, even|pg||
mb|2N|nt|peacokk: 1@C 16+ 1@D negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|pelu: in the "good old days" u could bid 3@D in W 9-11 - and but the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: vul isnt in his favour|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: 2@D presumably transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D 0-4 zz points|pg||
nt|mamos: Wse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: zz points: A=3, K=2, Q=1|pg||
nt|sommer: again, no real challenge..coffetime|pg||
nt|sommer: ruffingfinesse @D for overtrick after @HAK|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: this board belonged to EW:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but has been hijacked|pg||
nt|sommer: ..even a VERY lucky 3N dd:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: sorry West thinking?|pg||
nt|pelu: and buy the board|pg||
nt|pelu: Board 12 - final contract in OR also 2@s - but played by EW - Zia in 3. seat open 1NT on his 1-2-4-6 hand and Roy aked for major|pg||
nt|pelu: down 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yes   maximum   and good tricks |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and more will come!|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- this does look like a partscore hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 11 tricks in @HS for e-w and wud get to the game|pg||
nt|jtr: he deosnt care about trivial matters like that:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might not play well|pg||
nt|thorvald: Whats the range for ventins 2NT. Partner bid a free 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Why lead @hs?|pg||
nt|jtr: Good question|pg||
nt|jtr: about the range i mean|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: East knew keycards were missing|pg||
nt|peacokk: Nyström didn't cue a shortage in partners suit and they were at the same wavelenght, well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 2@S intervention seems very aggressive|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s are doomed now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: might make six on a non-club lead|pg||
nt|sommer: oooo|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos: again just the odd overtrick to be played for|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match at this table: Weinstein-Garner vs Blakset-Røn|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=transfer to hearts, 2N=transfer break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect 3@d=re-transfer, but not sure |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt must be a supper accept and 3@D a retransfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was told 2Nt also announced a min hand in their methods|pg||
nt|suketbombi: every card working overtime and Q ( of @CS in will make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Q9 of @Cs|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sommer: pew|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia wants to look at trick 1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: At the other table: Zorlu-Assael vs Bocchi-Madala|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|ndemirev: 4S here is a desaster on the layout. |pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S by S is for me an overbid - max 3@D = invit with @s-support|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S Ok - but 4@S - I dont understrand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next round at this table (20 mins past the hour): Helness-Helgemo  vs  Martens-Jassem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2728.html  for standings after round 6 |pg||
nt|roswolf: table speed is slowing down|pg||
nt|pelu: even if decl eliminate the red suits and play @C to the A he go down ruff-discard dont help him 4-4 in C|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|suketbombi: this will be quick from here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ndemirev: 3N had some remore chances|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ndemirev: *remote|pg||
nt|pelu: the 10 IMP came from board 2 - Welland in 3NT - lucky here when @dAK in N|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|sommer: he scared me:)|pg||
nt|sommer: may go 3 light now, but it was still impossible to pun..imo|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|nt|mamos: the Slam played by East would have been difficult to defend perhaps|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sommer: and 11|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, no problems for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: That was right|pg||

nt|athene: but really not easy at all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spscs asking if one can get the system in detail anywhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pocken?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: 2@c also Gameforcing relay here -- another variation though|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf  is all I can produce|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No system notes|pg||
nt|pocken: Unfortunaltely no, you´d have to ask them in private|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: All you convention-freaks -- there will be something to be looking forward to in the next round -- these two swedes against Martens-Jassem from Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh wait a second, that link has 11 pages|pg||
nt|Walddk2: better than nothing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Martens-Jassem are playing Polish @c and strong @c depending on the vul|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S is a little better than the heart finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's worth bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't make here though|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 2@h = 6@s and any 4-card suit |pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|vugraphzsg: no alert of 3@d|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@D and 3@H are both natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I guess 3@h shows 6@ss and 4@hs|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Røn not too thrilled, knowing that the D cue bid must be a singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: difficult for S now -- what about the missing @c cue?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: after the double of 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: will Lars bid on here?|pg||
nt|stewball: S should know this is on a finesse|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|athene: south really likes his singleton diamond, after the double of 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: but he;s bidding it anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 4@s shows a @c cue !|pg||
nt|iceking: no luck here with bad breaks always down|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|stewball: another crushing result for the swedes|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: usually in this sort of situation you look to see if you can combine chances in various suits|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. drop @CQ doubleton or fall back on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: but here it's just not happening|pg||
nt|athene: the heart return forces declarer to commit |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could have played for clubs to come in, but it did not matter|pg||

nt|mdgraham: another hand with @C AKQ10 seventh|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and that too in @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Madala has 14 cards and Bocchi 12|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :):)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not good|pg||
nt|suketbombi: not fair also:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: TD sorted it out|pg||

nt|sommer: y, 150 will be common|pg||

nt|roswolf: and now a momma papa slam|pg||

nt|jtr: Hmm not quite mmomma papa is it?|pg||
nt|thorvald: It seems the slam will go down, but I think it will be bid 15 vs 15|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sommer: (wasnt possible to get the beer..and the o.t.)|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy to bid and provided rightsided trivial to make|pg||
mb|2C|an|Not GF|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsh: Bocchi want 6 cards more|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 5@C an excellent contract but if NV E-w will fight hard and get to 5@H wud be a bad result for them|pg||
mb|3D|an|4.|nt|mdgraham: can NS get to 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can all see 3NT is good - but South can't see the KQ to six|pg||
nt|pelu: but for sure  Nt better than 4@S - also every time @D are 4-3 - so I will take lucky back :) and just compliment Zia-Welland :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: h/h again frisky|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sommer: EW are playing a system called "Nusine@C"|pg||
nt|thorvald: How will you make it on a @d-lead ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, i think a helicopter is needed to reach dummy and make it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: In my opinion E has to act and bid @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia: Bid 3@h pd|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w in 3nt?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..they were in 1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Jassem is thinking:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i know this is a TTASL position|pg||
nt|sommer: will Jassem realy raise now??|pg||
nt|sommer: dont think so|pg||
nt|pelu: Jelness could have passed 1NT out - now EW - with 26 HCP are close to 3NT|pg||
nt|sommer: E 1NT was too good|pg||
nt|roswolf: ttasl -TEACH THEM A SHARP LESSON|pg||
nt|sommer: he has 15..but 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: ie bid game and make it when you could have passed them out in partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: lol mike i think she could|pg||
nt|sommer: 8 losers...|pg||
nt|jtr: Welland probably has one but i am not sure about Wrang|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think a @h lead is the only way to make it, but looking at west hand a heart might be the only way to beat it, knowing partner has an ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heliocopter might be available|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point thorvald|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, it might be necessary to set up a trick before partner's ace is knocked out|pg||
nt|roswolf: also welland is prone to this sort of play|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: although she will shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will w]be good/bad news|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: typical pairs action - pre-empt to the limit, then let the opponsnts sort it out. |pg||
nt|jtr: South has not shown his values yet|pg||
nt|jtr: He has now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: now a trump?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: too late tho|pg||
nt|mdgraham: shouldn't matter - one spade ruff brings down the queen |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Think it required an initial trump lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: can set up @DS too while @Sak intact @Ds 3-33 or JX best chance|pg||
nt|pelu: again: we have a lots of spectators I like all the comment, but I dont like that there are so many "John Do's" - pl update your profil with name and nation - many commentators dont ...|pg||
nt|pelu: answer chat from thus "no-name" spects - please :):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a good start|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Bad/bad news?|pg||
nt|sommer: wow ...sryyyy|pg||
nt|sommer: that was strange:)|pg||
nt|sommer: imho|pg||
nt|pelu: only few boards to go - but in a long match that bidding will slow NS down a little :)|pg||
nt|jtr: OK All academic|pg||
nt|roswolf: anyway no real test now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: quite an unusual lead - @DQ must have been an option|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@d here has to be competitive, otherwise South may get frozen out with a strongish balanced hand|pg||
nt|peacokk: Not much in the play here, we all would score the 9 obvious tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as to the suit quality (and length) required, well...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sommer: Nusine was Blaksets cat..I think:)..must be dead for years now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, diamonds are 3-3 and there are the entries to set them up|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no can set up @Ds in isolation|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|sommer: Tor will be unhappy with his 2@D:)..|pg||
nt|pelu: Martens can only see 8 tricks - but wjen he play @C - he will smile :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Only problem in 6@S is that Wrang has 4 hearts, so against the slam i think I would have lead the unbid suit - anyway this one will have no problems  11 trcicks ?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sommer: answer to many: It wasnt the cat, who invented the system:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Thought he would overtake and finesse @c|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sommer: ..Lars did|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs to get their diamond trick set up|pg||
nt|pelu: easy come - easy go - now the "D-loser can be parked on @C|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||

nt|sommer: ..good for EW:)..not for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: If S has Hxxx in clubs there is an endplay?|pg||

pc|h3|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2730.html  for standings after round 8|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: EW leading|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Denmark vs Sweden|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|athene: NS are weak notrump, 5-card majors, short club|pg||
nt|athene: EW are strong clubbers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll find their CC in a minute|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lots of relays with  zz's|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: both sides play low card = encourage or even number|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|stewball: this is an example of the benefits of weak nts,,EW are guessing now..and they guessed right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C majors, 2@D asks - i guess he bid 2@D rather than 2@H because he preferred to play the 5-2 rather than the 4-3, if partner happened to have 5@S4@H|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: the EW card does say that 2@C might be only 4-3 majors with diamond length - maybe that means they just like to be able to pass partner's 2@D ask?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|stewball: little surprised N didnt start trumps|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: 9 and 10 first in this room, followed by comparisons from the other room when we circle back to board 1|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|stewball: very unlikely his @c tricks were going away|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Magnús|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h8|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|iceking: 2@C was stayman i think |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||

nt|mdgraham: for some people, yes :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: refreshing to find someone not bashing a game|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|mdgraham: that possible heart slam was bid on board 6 - unforunately, North was on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10-12|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 9 tricks for EW and 5 for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: all the spot cards making a difference here|pg||
nt|peacokk: EW might be in trouble now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not for the rest of us|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: and now will h/h hustle here as well?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: yup:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes - this could end up in something doubled - no, South has come to the rescue|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: I am slow I still dont see how he maded 4@S? ruffed a @c and played @hK?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s looks sorta obvious|pg||
nt|roswolf: the americans dont do "obvious" quickly:)|pg||
nt|sommer: wasn't it --2, ope?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah had enough!?|pg||
nt|sommer: Søren?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: It will brobably be a partial |pg||
nt|jtr: Wow The leaders bid and made 6@h on 5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|sommer: wasnt 2N -2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: No @d conn|pg||
nt|roswolf: another bizarre bid by west - but there again what do i know!?:(|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: well, it's something doubled, anyway|pg||
nt|mamos: well  it came to something doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just not by EW|pg||
nt|sommer: tough, but makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: East took one @d|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sommer: the stiff @DK helps W|pg||
nt|suketbombi: to early for him to run the @H to T with so many chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most people hate leading from four to the jack - will South run it?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S/4@S 3@HS a @C + possible 2@DS may not run|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: It was easy?|pg||
nt|roswolf: to us palookas yes:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|sommer: with @HAK in S, he may even score an overtrick..but I think, he will try to make 8 first:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now he can count 3 spades and 4 clubs and a diamond, when NS dont start ruffing @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Zia-Welland missed the game in 14 (6 imp)|pg||
nt|sommer: ahh, ok|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: he opted for the bid which was closest to his cards i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Welland ask ab lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ndemirev: 3D was a nice bid |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|suketbombi: Madala will dare not reyrn a @H:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|thorvald: with @hs 3-3 its makeable, but I don't think he will guess it|pg||
nt|ritong: double then @hs is not really attractive|pg||
nt|ritong: neither a direct 2@h|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@hs and exit @c?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|mamos: EW clearly seem to have misjudged   not clear what South's 2@D showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2@d nat nf|pg||
pc|hK|nt|suketbombi: return:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Helgemo has 10 6 in @h|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|peacokk: Pass was probably forcing and DBL for penalties|pg||
nt|tez: defence has 6 trick in 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems not|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sommer: now @SAKQ and @C's|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzsh: yes|pg||
nt|peacokk: Pass by Nyström over 2@D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: can make 9 by endplaying S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may play clubb to the Q now |pg||
pc|h5|pc|d8|nt|mamos: South probably knew tha EW could not pass 2@D out|pg||
pc|d3|nt|thorvald: exiting with a @s will still see him home as south wil be squeezed before declarer|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jtr: WEll, if South could cash teh last @c it wouldnt work|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|sommer: @SJ and small @H:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so nine tricks in clear view|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes He has unblocke @H8 i was told:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It showed at least 4-3 in the majors|pg||
nt|iceking: yes and if pd has 3-4-5-1 shape he can pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C denies a major|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: 2@C here natural denies major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: either 5-4 in the minors or 6 clubs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|iceking: limited opening 11-15hcp |pg||
nt|athene: north likes his club spots|pg||
nt|athene: @CA987 is a much worse hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jacob Røn junior World Champion 1998 Hamilton, Canada. Maybe John was there|pg||
nt|stewball: not as a player..much too old:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1997, sorry|pg||
nt|athene: even with the blocked hearts, declarer can't quite get there|pg||
nt|iceking: well|pg||
pc|c7|nt|iceking: if Jakob ducks this Peter needs to do well|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: yes, best shot might be to duck and hope for a continuation|pg||
nt|athene: that saves you a tempo and an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was a typo, his name is spelt Jacob with a   c     Corrected now|pg||
nt|stewball: 4@s a lucky make|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard for east to put his partner with @HQ and @DK - it doesn't leave north much for the jump to 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: And I am so  sorry for that !! :)|pg||
nt|iceking: makeing game here will be monster score for the danes |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2730.html  for standings after round 8|pg||
nt|iceking: 11hcp vs 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We had a 79-1 and 78-2 in the previous round as you see|pg||
nt|iceking: this is going to be very hard def to find i think|pg||
nt|stewball: Peter surely knows whats happening in @c..trying to figure how to continue|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|iceking: its possible Fredrik had T63 of @C or|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First prize in this event is 50,000 Danish Kroner, around 7,000 Euro, US$ 9,500|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer has the hand he has but with the @DK instead of the @HQ, obviously the contract is cold|pg||
nt|athene: so east just has to work out if he needs his partner to have both top red honours or if he can ever beat the contract when declarer has the @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Røn did all he could, dropping the 9 was good|pg||
nt|athene: sorry i meant if declarer had @DK instead of @DQ, sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: This information is only for the "scandinavian viewers": HUSK, at melde dig ind i BBO NORDIC -- saa du kan være med i turneringen den 14. november 2010|pg||

pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: They don't matter much with this format|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Making 3NT will be a great score regardless|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: if declarer had both red queens, that defence wasn't beating either, so you might as well just cash at least one top heart i think|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
