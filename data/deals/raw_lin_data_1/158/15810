pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ian111:  going for the other 7 card fit|pg||
nt|mango joe: when that doesnt work he will have to play on @D break|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Arun from India|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  big double fit here for NS but only 10 tricks in 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the save in 5@c is likely which might push NS to 5@h|pg||

nt|ian111:  board 17 flat - but I preferred Spear's line|pg||
nt|mrdct:  gill might splinter in @h if available|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ian111:  a C at trick 2|pg||
nt|mrdct:  or introduce a clever psyche with a view to retreating to @c later|pg||
nt|mango joe: good result for Australia in closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: likely collect 2@H and then South will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|mango joe:  West cud hv made a negative X one wud hv thought|pg||
nt|mrdct:  as south, i like to keep 2@H as a natural bid in this auction|pg||
nt|mrdct:  north might suspect west has psyched now!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  yes - X seems normal|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: 3@D now may get them there...|pg||

nt|mrdct:  actually - undo all of those comments - i believe EW play transfer over their 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mrdct:  1@h will just be showing 4+ @s|pg||
nt|mango joe: looks like only 89 tricks on likely @H lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct:  whilst NS can be held to 10 tricks, that depends of a defence of two black aces at tricks 1 & 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@H is 4 +@S|pg||
nt|mango joe: 8 lol|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: or 4@H as you say!|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D for us mere mortals!|pg||

nt|ian111:  e/w recovered to bif 4H|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ian111:  bid |pg||
nt|ian111:  N/S take the red save - might go -2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: sorry caps lock  try A@C and three rounds of @D s|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure even I could go down!|pg||
nt|mango joe: a good vul sacrifice if he gets @S right|pg||
nt|mango joe: E will have to find 4 discards on the run of @cx and may have to bare his K@D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct:  this looks to be one or two down - so a lost opportunity for australia|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west has perhaps already shown his hand with his 1@S bid and ought to have left the 5-level decision to compete to east|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ian111:  as so often - no one able to double|pg||
nt|mango joe: so Australia draws level|pg||
pc|s4|nt|viren169: 5 @H + 3@S + 2 ruffs = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should find this defence |pg||

nt|vugraphzat: west is pondering|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|mrdct:  if he thinks the @sK is still, his best line is to win @SA and run @c to shorten north's trumps|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: today the drinks are on the house ...by the organisers|pg||
nt|viren169: and one for you, no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is routine now |pg||
nt|vicky888:  Amazing start for Hemant Jalan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: A fit Jump by Rana showing hand better than 4@h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mango joe: easy 3NT here for N/S|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: still 11 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and I also will act as W now - non vulnerable|pg||
nt|mango joe: wonder what 2@S is, its certainly not weak but 9 tricks seems to be the limit here with 2 trump losers|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  it is interesting, as it has to play three tricks better|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: That is a nice touch--wish they would do that here too  --well done|pg||

nt|mrdct:  @s lead best for NS|pg||

nt|viren169: just showing 4@S on the way - I guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: 11 tricks--next |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: let @cK win|pg||

mb|p|nt|mango joe: esp in the last round of the round robin|pg||

mb|p|nt|mango joe: qualified for the semis by the skin of their teeth |pg||

nt|mango joe: 10 points and 5 card suit opposite a strong NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: I have to admit I'm in the 1N-3N camp.|pg||
nt|garnetts: with AQxxx in a minor it will be 5 tricks a lot of the time and you should bid 3NT in my view because partner will never know that|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: The crux of this hand comes next --|pg||
nt|viren169: Whatever opener has.. 3N is a good bet most of the time!|pg||
nt|viren169: Oh dear... Flat board - I lost again!|pg||
nt|mango joe: this should mke unless he plays @S to K|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: 6@H is not an odds on contract and will fail here unless declerer plays for a 4/1 @H after discovering 6/2 @DS|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: 2@S was a forced bid on which Rana showed @HS and @Cs+ game force|pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: oddly enough 2-1 scores here because it will start either with 1@D or 1@C and the 1NT response will show up to a about 11 and clubs which will shut east up for the right reasons |pg||
nt|suketbombi: Mahesh can we have the udate on scores?|pg||

nt|paulg:  good switch!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|garnetts: after 3@H North might try 3NT  for the minors or in view the double implies minors as he might have acted before with spades |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|paulg:  less good switch|pg||
pc|cK|nt|suketbombi: no more @S discard anal:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Duncan still needs to return a diamond otherwise it will disappear|pg||
nt|mrdct:  if @h are 3-3 he only needs 1 @d trick buy if @H are 4-2 he needs 2 @d tricks - but he doesn't know how many @d tricks he needs until after he's exhausted his entries to dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  Irving Gordon won the World Senior Pairs with a 90-year-old Boris Shapiro|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm not sure what west's dbl means. perhaps a side 4-card suit where bidding 3@d would show 5-5|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Same for u and kibs Paul|pg||
nt|mango joe: This hasnt been an exciting set so has favoured the teams leading in their matches|pg||
nt|mrdct:  it's been a long month of bridge for paul gosney who played in the Rosenblum, then the World Youth Championships, then the Commonwealth Nations and now the HCL - I'm sure he's feeling a little bit homesick by now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: NS have now passed the best contract 3nt|pg||
nt|mango joe: dont much care for Norths opening as he doesnt have a rebid over 2@Cs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: They have also pinpointed the defence too --no heart control |pg||
nt|viren169: North was hoping they went on!|pg||
nt|garnetts: North should lead the A@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: this will clear things up for him|pg||
nt|garnetts: If he doesn't like that the A@H is a standout |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: north asking east....thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: Not an easy lead...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|suketbombi: have a great party thx for the brodcast and Good luck for the taj trip see you on Friday|pg||

nt|mango joe: Hemant need something good to happen soon|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
nt|mango joe: can he find out about Q@S?|pg||
nt|mango joe: he cant bid 7 with any surety|pg||
nt|mango joe: he knows abut K@D A@C and Q to four @hs|pg||
nt|mango joe: and he knows that N will have a bit more for his opening |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: hoping that partner has @sq also|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes but it will be on a hope rather than certainty|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: I can understand the @s lead from E|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mango joe: or QJ@D to 4|pg||
nt|mango joe: KQJ i mean|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: I am afraid it is an easy lead--look at your hand and lsiten to the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still a lot to do|pg||

nt|paulg:  i wonder if 3NT is a 4-level minor pre-empt, or a flawed solid suit?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: meanwhile Ausies consolidating further and are now 42 imps +|pg||

nt|mango joe: wow!!|pg||
nt|mango joe: E/W likely to reach the unmakeable 3N|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzat: 8 boards 28..not much with the imps flowing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  difficult for East to move on, despite his controls|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@h is on a @s finess also 7@h|pg||
nt|mango joe: who won the final Ian?|pg||
nt|ian111:  both sides can make 10 tricks in a minor|pg||
nt|ian111:  which final ?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Hemant or Scotland?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Commonwealth Games Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzat:  Hemant Jalan leads Alpha by 75-0:   Arun Jain leads Magic Eyes( thailand) by 22:   Australia leads Formidables 51-19|pg||
nt|ian111:  Hemant |pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: This is a board, wher you have to choose betwenn 5 ot 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  it was close with about 8 boards to play, but ended up over 40 to Hemant|pg||
nt|mango joe: 2@H shows less than 4 points normally, its the weakest response|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg:  if North would bypass a 4-card diamond suit to bid 1NT, as many would, then pass is an option that would not work out well|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but Duncan-Gordon are pretty old-school and so retreating to clubs looks sensible|pg||
nt|mango joe: India has a lot of depth in bridge, many ggod teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: satya checking opps conv card for lead explanation?|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  safely navigated|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: N-s can make a game in @S due to exremely lucky lay out but not likely to be there|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mango joe: was 4@D forcing here? I think not|pg||
nt|ian111:  hard to stop, but a lack of Aces ...|pg||
nt|ian111:  3C usually FG|pg||
nt|mango joe: esp after S opens|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  there is little worse than leading a trump to cut down dummy's ruffs and seeing 3334 put down|pg||

nt|mrdct:  gill might ruff this to lead a @c through|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||

nt|mrdct:  NS will need to bid and make 3NT here to have any hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: 4@S is a good contract needs @S 3-2|pg||
nt|ian111:  might make 4S if declarer reads the S position|pg||
nt|ian111:  west has awkward choice  over 3H|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  and, perhaps, 4-card majors (as that is certainly Duncan's preference)|pg||
nt|ian111:  X usually = extra values|pg||
nt|mango joe: which he has one would think|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: www.hcl-bridge.com|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct:  or take 1NTx for a big number|pg||
nt|mrdct:  north endplayed on teh opening lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: that will suit East nicely|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ian111:  they've boith chose to keep a little in reserve|pg||
nt|mango joe: a kib points out that 6@D makes but I think its very unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mango joe: Norths hand has improved though as South has shown short @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: 40 imps needed in 3 boards, havent seen that before|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  a less exciting hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: unless defence slip up looks like -1|pg||
nt|andybe: this should be a quick board|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: waiting for lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: @ds 4-1 so 6@D not on|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: I thought East might bid 2@S there :(|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  when holding long trumps it is often best to lead your own long suit, rather than a singleton, to try and force declarer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he is wary about their Game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four-card support and all that - still, he is a bit thin in the high-card department|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this should play ok despite the 4-1 trump split - West will spend the whole hand being endplayed  |pg||
pc|c4|nt|andybe: should ask for attitude|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mrdct:  this will be 1 or 2 down i think|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the @h pips work well for declarer though - so he should make at least 6 tricks now and where there is a 6th there si often a 7th|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: poddar through easily|pg||
nt|mango joe: this has no chance and will go 1 or 2 off depending on whether they can engineer a @C ruff|pg||
nt|mango joe: even 5 is in danger with repeated @H plays|pg||
nt|mango joe: East found the best lead|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||

nt|mango joe: good defence|pg||

nt|ian111:  disappointment as he ruffs with C :-)|pg||
nt|mango joe: and 3 imps to Scotland|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|vugraphzat: Gordon Laughing|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: after seeing @h 3|pg||

mb|p|nt|mango joe: they playing on? i thought it was 12 X 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: Mahesh?|pg||
nt|ian111:  i thought so too|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes  12 x 3 |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: this set started with 15 as 1st|pg||
nt|mango joe: but this is 13th board|pg||
nt|ian111:  so why are we playing bd 25?|pg||
nt|mango joe: ah ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 15-  26|pg||
nt|mango joe: ok thanks|pg||
nt|ian111:  ah yes - 13/14 removed|pg||
nt|ian111:  looks like 4S -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|mrdct:  31 imps in 2 boards looks unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: part-score battle - bet 3@S is the final contract |pg||
mb|2D|nt|ian111:  needs a H guess and C finesse|pg||
nt|ian111:  could try 3NT and hope to avoid a H lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s on E or do you show a 2-suiter? |pg||
nt|paulg:  a slam swing on board 25 has given Hemant Jalan some breathing room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i show two-suiters these days|pg||
nt|mrdct:  pretty much need two double game swings|pg||
nt|suketbombi: abattle of partials here 4@D is the par tho|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  in my system, it would be 3@c to show non-strong spades and clubs|pg||
nt|mango joe: puppet|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  Duncan's bid depends on their methods after a reverse ... some play 2NT as artificial (with weak hands)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now E? do you regret only 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: yet to get a push board|pg||
nt|ian111:  not easy to bid the thin but good 5C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@C won't excite South particularly|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mrdct:  it would take a horrible defence to let NS make 5@d here - not that they are at all likley to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: arun jain 117- magic eyes 78|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  3NT probably suggests a weak club stop|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Gordon has nowhere to go .. he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: usually the weaker hand bids the major he doesnt have |pg||
nt|ian111:  4S by E might make on CJ lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  are the results on the web anywhere?|pg||
nt|mango joe: 9 top tricks now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that he will be all that excited by his hand anyway|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzat: see hcl website|pg||
nt|mrdct:  both 5@c and 3NT depend on the @s hook|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  this should be beaten on a club lead, as long as West does not cover the @sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  given West's poor spade intermediates, this should be easy to avoid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so much for that bet ;(|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  this will play well with the doubleton club with north and the @d10 preventing a force|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c is much easier than 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Ian|pg||
nt|andybe: good lead but will not gain any imps|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ian111:  hi |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|paulg:  not an easy lead for East to read, although to beat the contract he has little choice about playing West for an honour|pg||
nt|paulg:  or playing West for 98xx|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mango joe: at least the @H guess was easier|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the HCL website only seems to have hte results up to round 9 of the swiss|pg||
nt|mango joe: he will know Q@S and a key card is missing so will stop in 5 probably|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Aus vs Ind 1 for the silver and bronze medal.....Scotland have won the Gold Medal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Scotland has already won the Gold medal as the top national team in the event|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|vugraphzat: 2nd 3rd place|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mango joe: all to no avail though|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1 to 12 boards ...than 15 to 26|pg||
nt|ian111:  4S made at the other table|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ian111:  2h might struggle too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ian111:  S tried a small C at trick 2 after a H lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think bbo timetable was wrong - this started exactly one hour afer the advertised start time|pg||
nt|mrdct:  when is the restart?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes he was aiming for 5 |pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|nt|joemanjo: Looking at the combined hands, there is no need to protect the club King, but @cq is not known on the bidding|pg||

nt|mango joe: there was a problem with communicatios so only 9 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: declarer claimed 10 and accepted|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it's a compromise that was expensive this time, but gains in simplicity|pg||
nt|mango joe: the number of good Indian teams here is really impressive|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzat: 41 imps 5 boards|pg||
nt|ian111:  particularly to Subhash - the main orgnaniser|pg||

nt|andybe: will be difficult for NS to reach 3S now|pg||

nt|suketbombi: Manas will blackwood here to find 3 aces and a void|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, if 3@S sets spades unconditionally, you can - but you need to discuss it first |pg||
