mb|p|mb|1C|nt|iceking: unlucky good 7 here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|psridhar: can make on dia hook -Helness played for dia king to fall in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|iceking: and i bet they will not stop under 7 now|pg||
nt|iceking: has to be around 90% |pg||
nt|iceking: lets say you get @S lead you win home @D to ace ruff with T and lay down @C ace |pg||
mb|4N|nt|iceking: this looks like the correct line |pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|psridhar: yes if trumps break 3-1 or better he is fine|pg||
nt|iceking: and Thor played like that |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: cannot test trumps bcos he needs cl entry for dia ruff|pg||
nt|iceking: so very unlucky|pg||
nt|iceking: should played this hand like Helness did in closed room and i bet Zia will go down here |pg||
nt|smoller: 7NT more easy to make lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: yesterday Zia made an "impossible" 6@h -- lets see if he makes this 7@c|pg||
nt|iceking: but i been wrong before and always chance Welland bids 7nt|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: Welland is "gone" -- in deep thoughts -- rocking on his chair and head in hands|pg||
nt|psridhar: 7@c is superior to 7N|pg||
nt|iceking: could Welland not bid this hand little better like raise to 4@C try get maybe @D quebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2728.html  for standings after round 6 |pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: the % play in 7@c leads to d1, unlucky indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: and probably one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: but lets now see the tablefeeling play from Zia :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: but then many of us believe Zia is above %s :)|pg||
nt|iceking: this one is just so plain as i see it |pg||
nt|xenya: note that 3@C by Zia overstates his hand somewhat|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: yesterday he made 6@hs because the opps tried to "scare" him --- and "Its only my wife that can scare me" Zia told after the board|pg||

pc|d6|nt|iceking: one little trap in this one, if Zia had played low @C to K and @C from 8 from dummy Fredrik would have need to cover it but iam sure he would|pg||

nt|Walddk2: First prize in this event is 50,000 Danish Kroner, around 7,000 Euro, US$ 9,500|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzsg: "you should have played @d K instead" said Roy to Peter -- "I will wait with that until later" was the answar :)|pg||
nt|iceking: 1.150.000 Icelandic kroners:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't count|pg||
nt|iceking: true|pg||
nt|psridhar: Note Helness rebid only 2@c but it still got him to 7@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't even buy a red herring for that amount|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c4|pc|dK|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Amos, Povl Sommer and Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so we´ve got the 1st and 2nd pairs|pg||
nt|xenya: They were 1 and 2 after Round 3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 7th, EW 3rd.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham, Mike Amos and Erik Fryklund|pg||

nt|mamos: my brain needs start up time  but cant see 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|peacokk: A squeeze |pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: are the norwegians awake enough to bid this slam|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Probably not the best line to play anyhow|pg||
nt|peacokk: in the long run|pg||
nt|tez: zorlu assael have 9 card @h but very bad split|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ndemirev: S hand, despite the 14 count, is too slow. Passing 3d is very reasonable |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Roland. 4@d must be in no danger, so 3@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: MGrand possible - which will fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: this isnt best contract|pg||
mb|4S|an|BW|nt|mamos: defence looks favoutite here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: flat hands are often disappointing|pg||
nt|sommer: if W takes the normal way in @C's, NS must hurry to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: something lower you think Povi?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Garner/Weinstein will let it through|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is ok;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is also a winner but difficult to spot|pg||
mb|4N|an|3|mb|p|nt|roswolf: with the diamond finesse working 13 tricks are there|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C 4-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: it wont be bid - of course|pg||
mb|7C|nt|roswolf: 4-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: just a question of how many - not enormously important at this form of scoring|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sommer: got the chance there!|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry |pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: in grand u have 12 tricks by finess @cJ - but if decl start ruffing @Ds for the 13. trick he is down - only the finess for @dK will give him 13|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sommer: not easy for S to shift from KJ6|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe these guys are world champs or something:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The scoring is IMPs so big pick up possible here for HeHe|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Well, maybe 5@D can go down on a club lead, but East would never find that|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt and 5@d was makeble..5@c beats only @c lead (may be)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|c9|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s9|pc|c8|nt|pelu: an "normal play is: @sA @d to A @D ruff, @C to king and entry shor - he need to play @C to finess|pg||

nt|sharkey: "palooka"?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: a very basic(poor)player|pg||

nt|mdgraham: life is cruel|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c5|pc|dK|pg||

nt|smoller: 3NT anyone? Better contract than 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and all the players in this tournament is "technicians"|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: Board 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room is just one of seven comparisons|pg||

nt|iceking: thats just one of the best bidding i seen |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next round at this table (20 mins past the hour): Zia-Welland vs Bocchi-Madala|pg||
nt|psridhar: Zia Welland will swing into lead now hurting the leaders|pg||
nt|psridhar: very unlikely contract this 3N but yes brilliant indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: should be a huge win for Zia/Welland|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but not even a try? not like Zia!|pg||
nt|suketbombi: that was a quick job|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: this is unlucky too for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good evening all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: Well, 14 balanced with @SQx. I understand pass|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Welland could have started with a 2S (as a passed hand) to encourage Zia to bid more |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|suketbombi: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S|pg||
nt|ndemirev: HIs hand was great in context |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is a match from round 6 and the last today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they're ok in 3NT, but 4@s looks likely|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: strong club, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  any 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=relay (I think), may be 20+|pg||
nt|peacokk: I guess they will end up in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: can they get to 3nt by west?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and a @c lead against 3nt hadn´t defeated if Welland had played  @cQ from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham and Raju Tolani|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: i think S should have read the @H position on the previous hand|pg||
nt|tez: need agrement here..whats dbl?t/o to @d or good @c's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and not 5@d either|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: probably long suit, wekaish hand, and reasonable conclusion  |pg||
nt|mamos: standings after first two rounds of this strong tournament at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S would be second negative so 2@C shows some values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hence 3NT|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2727.html  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 1@s might not be to everyone's taste, but it has worked well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|xenya: they found a nice spot|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sommer: yes, this will be easy - guess, it will be bid all over|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: not a hand of great interest  -- Butler style scoring I think  effectively imp Pairs    scored on 80-0 match basis|pg||
nt|mamos: ten boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: total imps across the field, two results scratched, with a cap at 40 imp  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pairs are given 40 imps so no negative scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't lose more than the 40 IMPs you have when you start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big scores in the last round:  80-0  77-3  and  71-7|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Screens are not in use|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 75 minutes to complete 10 boards|pg||

nt|iceking: NS play strong @C system ew pretty natural system|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Welland hasnt said anything yet Roland :)|pg||
nt|smoller: Seems that South must guess the hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Welland and Zia discussing board 1 -- and Bertheau is thinking about this one|pg||
pc|dT|nt|iceking: yes hard to see were trick 9 will come from if you dont guess @H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: that lead notwithstanding Bertheau is still some distance form trick no 9-needs a @h guess may be|pg||
nt|iceking: we are playing round 7, 10 boards each round imps across the field|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't get minus|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: But we had one 80-0 yesterday|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This N-S pair against Grogeland-Sælensminde|pg||
nt|psridhar: Also, in my opinion 10 boards is a good compromise ( on time scale ) for these matches |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brogeland|pg||
nt|iceking: NS play very complicated system we might see it later if they get there relays going |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 75 minutes to complete 10 boards. No screens in use|pg||
nt|iceking: also Zia vs Zorlu 80-0|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the same round we had a 71-9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very extreme results|pg||
nt|iceking: Zia and Welland didnt start this tourney well first board they were playing 3ntxx down 1600 after defensive mistake should have gone for 2200|pg||

nt|sharkey: 4@S shud fail with E as declarer as well previous board|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: fourth highest of dummy's longest and strongest |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Lead 3.-5.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, fifth|pg||
nt|pelu: decl has to look for his 9. tricks in @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny heart position - suit is blocked. Of course South canot know that |pg||
nt|roswolf: but he may have to play for it in effect|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S misguesses @H think will fail if EW play passive defence|pg||
nt|pelu: look like !§D10 is the correct card - woring - then West easy can set up his @D - so 1. trick on @DK and then @D to 10 - to keep control|pg||
