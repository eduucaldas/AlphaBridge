mb|3D|nt|athene: that seems a bit weird but Meckstroth said something of the sort anyway didn't he in his book?|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|athene: do they play 4@C is the heart raise here and 4@D would be forcing with clubs?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where is Pocken?|pg||
nt|athene: allowing room for a "last train" 4@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: there has been some corrections -- updated results: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2732.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|pocken: I´m here, but this 4 @C bid is news to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: It was alerted but nobody asked -- so I cant help at this moment|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|pocken: I thought 4@C was a good raise with no control in @D and 4@D with control|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|pocken: but apparently not|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: the trouble with a last-train 4@d is that South might bid a slam over it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have been in worse slams|pg||
nt|dburn: not that he's necessarily wrong to do so - slam is by no means bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 4@C is explained by Fredrik as GF with short @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So one of them got the system wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has shortish diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I thought it was without a shortage -- says Peter ---- and ends with a "SORRY" -- always a good idea :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: still, unless East leads a rather unlikely spade, North has a play for this|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: This tournament is played without screens|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: who would you play for @cQ?|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi has an ultra-pure 3@D bid but that might not be such a good thing if it helps declarer with the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, how does he tackle clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: now he must guess clubs, but the 3@d bid may help him|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: E has shown short @hs|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but he has also shown long diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he believes @HQ was a signal for spades he does not have to find @CQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: a board that might decide the tournament -- even though there is 4 rounds left after this|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Then he can eliminate and endplay West|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|pocken: If you can trust East to hold 7 @D then I think he should get it right|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk2: They never have 7 at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A rare exception|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D in the other room worked a lot better|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham, Mike Amos and Erik Fryklund|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello everyone|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS?|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Tez|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia is 1 with 212 and Zorlu is 2. with 192|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: small upgrade from N?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and south might do the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Auken-von Arnim  vs   Bertheau-Nyström|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like a normal 4 @S, but with open cards 3NT looks better to me|pg||
nt|thorvald: A partscore in @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: NS 2nd, EW 9th|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe 3@S now|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, they play 15-17, but the 5c is treated as 1 extra|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul may allow EW to bid on to 5@d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: We will get names up soon|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: choice of games here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to David Bird|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec points out that the CC for NS can be found at http://1833.bridge.no.Helgemo_Helness.html |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: are the norwegians awake enough to bid this slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed thorvald|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|xenya: hello David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html  for standings after round 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was just looking through the VG records for this event. Several big boards yesterday.|pg||
nt|jtr: Thought you were away somewhere (exotic)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room eventually is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@c i imagine was Drury|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's singleton ace in partner's suit is not a good omen for bidding on.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peacokk: Probably not the best line to play anyhow|pg||
nt|peacokk: in the long run|pg||
nt|tez: zorlu assael have 9 card @h but very bad split|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ndemirev: S hand, despite the 14 count, is too slow. Passing 3d is very reasonable |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Roland. 4@d must be in no danger, so 3@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: MGrand possible - which will fail|pg||
nt|sommer: good game|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a club lead to break 4 of a major i think|pg||
nt|thorvald: An easy game here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sommer: this isnt best contract|pg||
nt|sommer: still makeable|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, 3NT much better|pg||
nt|roswolf: and duly reached|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mamos: defence looks favoutite here|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia downgraded his @ss to 4 cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, Drury, you think.|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice to have 7 in case partner forgets:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: You are right|pg||
nt|andyv:  and that link seems to have a problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  (or I typed it wrong)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: flat hands are often disappointing|pg||
nt|sommer: if W takes the normal way in @C's, NS must hurry to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: something lower you think Povi?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Garner/Weinstein will let it through|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is ok;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is also a winner but difficult to spot|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|roswolf: with the diamond finesse working 13 tricks are there|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C 4-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: it wont be bid - of course|pg||
nt|jtr: Happens|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4-0|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some pairs use Safe Drury.|pg||
nt|jtr: You are Mrs Bird perhaps?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade support, with clubs... just in case.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, but my wife is. Are you feeling OK?|pg||
nt|jtr: Some work sorting this one out|pg||
nt|thorvald: Any suggestions of how to play this ?|pg||
nt|jtr: You and sorry:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: But anyway nice to see some of the local players|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: just a question of how many - not enormously important at this form of scoring|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|sommer: got the chance there!|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry |pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: in grand u have 12 tricks by finess @cJ - but if decl start ruffing @Ds for the 13. trick he is down - only the finess for @dK will give him 13|pg||
nt|jtr: Tried to steal a @s trick|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still playing to get as many tricks as possible, i think he will play clubs next |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sommer: not easy for S to shift from KJ6|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe these guys are world champs or something:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The scoring is IMPs so big pick up possible here for HeHe|pg||
nt|thorvald: on a heart continuation that is|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, his entries are getting tangled now|pg||
nt|jtr: The @d is quite effective in that regard|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, might be tricky|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|thorvald: he can afford 3 spade loosers, but its getting messy |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jtr: This works well to start with|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2732.html  for standings after round 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  that link does work:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Well, maybe 5@D can go down on a club lead, but East would never find that|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt and 5@d was makeble..5@c beats only @c lead (may be)|pg||
nt|xenya: also difficult to defend though|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: for standings after round 8 go to http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2730.html|pg||

nt|athene: there's a case for bidding either 2 or 4 with that east hand - if you bid 3 you tell them what you have but don't pre-empt them enough to make it worth while|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 10-12 in 1st |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NV|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 2nd and 3rd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
nt|dburn: interesting view by Nystrom not to use Stayman with two potentially weak black suits|pg||
nt|athene: you could miss a game passing with 13 but firstly 10 is much more likely than 12 and secondly at this vulnerability you get the big profits when EW come into the auction unwisely|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may have done very well - on this lead, 3NT has good chances, while on any lead 4@h would probably not make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2732.html  for standings after round 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: seems like a very good start for Sweden here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the last round today. The remaining four tomorrow from 12.00 CET, 11.00 GMT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 am New York|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I did take daylight saving in NA into account|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They switch tonight I believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: "Coffee coffee coffee .." after the third time Fredrik left the table - and returned with a cup of coffee for Peter -- thats a good partner !!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No screens in use|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 75 minutes to complete 10 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: This information is only for the "scandinavian viewers": HUSK, at melde dig ind i BBO NORDIC -- saa du kan være med i turneringen den 14. november 2010|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kl. 20.00 tror jeg|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Spectacular switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like he must duck this when @HK is offside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To cut communications|pg||
nt|athene: he has to go for hearts before diamonds as well?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I think this looks like the kind of bridge I would like to be able to play :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why these guys are playing and we are not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lesser players become commentators and operators :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are right Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He must play hearts before diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: to knock out Bocchi's entry first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand with long spades|pg||
nt|athene: club shift would lead to the same thing - you have to knock east's entry out first before he gets his black trick(s) set up|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Fascinating deal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's problem is that he doesn't really want to use the @CA to reach hand for a heart finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Brilliant bridge all round|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: and of course he doesn't know he can play a club safely|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: How lucky we are to be able to watch this|pg||
nt|athene: so he just gives up on the heart finesse|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|athene: losing to west's @HK would only be a disaster if it gave him a tempo to get his spades going|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: and west can't really have the long spades|pg||

nt|tez: 5@d i mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but not even a try? not like Zia!|pg||
nt|suketbombi: that was a quick job|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup miscounted the losera:(|pg||
nt|sommer: some may miss game there|pg||
nt|jtr: Carry on from Sunday Times|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is unlucky too for e/w|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good evening all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Happy days...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk4: Well, 14 balanced with @SQx. I understand pass|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Welland could have started with a 2S (as a passed hand) to encourage Zia to bid more |pg||
nt|roswolf: i bet bocchi/madala wont miss out there|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: And its subsequent forms|pg||

mb|1S|nt|suketbombi: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S|pg||
nt|ndemirev: HIs hand was great in context |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is a match from round 6 and the last today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they're ok in 3NT, but 4@s looks likely|pg||
nt|pelu: just the opening Martens hoped to see :(:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: strong club, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  any 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=relay (I think), may be 20+|pg||
nt|peacokk: I guess they will end up in 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: The @c opening works well here lead wise|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: can they get to 3nt by west?|pg||
nt|jtr: Or could have:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like 4@H to me depends on reading the @h right - or wrong because the right solution is the antipercentage one|pg||
nt|thorvald: This wasnt the right contract with that lead|pg||
nt|thorvald: in danish unfortunately|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: Declarer has plenty of tricks.... but so do the defenders.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: and a @c lead against 3nt hadn´t defeated if Welland had played  @cQ from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham and Raju Tolani|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: i think S should have read the @H position on the previous hand|pg||
nt|tez: need agrement here..whats dbl?t/o to @d or good @c's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and not 5@d either|pg||
nt|sommer: no chance, I guess|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe even -2 after small @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: if see LH open with both majors - u bid 2@S in S? - not me - but I am old :)|pg||
nt|sommer: could be wrong to pass too, but you are right, Peter|pg||
nt|thorvald: But now it seems safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: well not a good hand for PRC i agree|pg||
nt|jtr: Hard to bid 5@c here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: in these zones, W may be very light|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: probably long suit, wekaish hand, and reasonable conclusion  |pg||
nt|mamos: standings after first two rounds of this strong tournament at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S would be second negative so 2@C shows some values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hence 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that may buy it|pg||
nt|andyv:  after W passed 1@s, the vul made it dangerous for E to further compete.|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2727.html  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 1@s might not be to everyone's taste, but it has worked well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be so good as the previous one...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|xenya: they found a nice spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: yes, this will be easy - guess, it will be bid all over|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: not a hand of great interest  -- Butler style scoring I think  effectively imp Pairs    scored on 80-0 match basis|pg||
nt|mamos: ten boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: total imps across the field, two results scratched, with a cap at 40 imp  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pairs are given 40 imps so no negative scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't lose more than the 40 IMPs you have when you start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big scores in the last round:  80-0  77-3  and  71-7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South probably wants to bid, but he has no guarantee of a fit anywhere |pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: Screens are not in use|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 75 minutes to complete 10 boards|pg||
nt|pelu: ????????????????|pg||
nt|thorvald: Interesting, not place for any mistakes in the defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite so|pg||

mb|1N|an|15-17 (14½)|nt|jtr: He might be able to eliminate the hand though|pg||
nt|roswolf: normal or just a rubbish multi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@H   seems normal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Ns game here too - just a question of which one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT or 4@h|pg||
nt|sommer: at least one would be quite safe, imo|pg||
nt|xenya: E would have been squeezed on the last trump, yes|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 @H here|pg||
nt|sommer: only for one overtrick:)|pg||
nt|mamos: if 1NT is 12-14  may play ther|pg||
nt|jtr: He can get out with a  trump|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2NT=12-13 hcp|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ndemirev: 4H is a normal destination here |pg||
nt|ndemirev: 6H could make double dummy |pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S shud fail with E as declarer as well previous board|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: fourth highest of dummy's longest and strongest |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Lead 3.-5.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, fifth|pg||
nt|pelu: decl has to look for his 9. tricks in @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny heart position - suit is blocked. Of course South canot know that |pg||
nt|roswolf: but he may have to play for it in effect|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S misguesses @H think will fail if EW play passive defence|pg||
nt|pelu: look like !§D10 is the correct card - woring - then West easy can set up his @D - so 1. trick on @DK and then @D to 10 - to keep control|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H =p/c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: or not :(|pg||
nt|sommer: this may be American Stayman|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another thinnish game|pg||
nt|thorvald: But then restricted choice no longer apply i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2MA is better than 2@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy NS game on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well he would win in dummy and play a @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty for info|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: 3D  must show 5+H|pg||
nt|ndemirev: now Welland may find another bid |pg||
nt|suketbombi: we say sorry for Being late not being ahead of time:)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that 1NT NS is 14-16 - 2. time N open 1NT on 14|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jtr: Then ruff a @d and play trump  If Zia had Hxx he would be endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: Might have raised @cs here|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 tricks to start with|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peacokk: Well played by Nyström, just a overtrick at stake here|pg||
nt|mamos: East has poor Spades  and knows declarer only has three minor cards|pg||
nt|sommer: S showed 4c@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: It was|pg||
nt|sommer: hi Søren:)..gl and well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: hi povl|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h was a sort of two-way shot here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sommer: yes..specs ask me..I am right..it is puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe they make something maybe we do|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|thorvald: And a lot of possibilities to mare more :-)|pg||
nt|thorvald: *Make|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: this looks hopeless|pg||
nt|pelu: spects tell: 15-17 - but Helness also open on 14 - seen 2-3 times here in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|sommer: is @H 3-3 with @HA right enough?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, they play 15-17.. but upgrades a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: still has to lose a club|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: i expect @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT was an alternative, when holding both the red aces. But he might prefer West to play it, perhaps with some red queens.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: ah well|pg||
nt|sommer: quite normal in US to jump to 3@C changing from normal to (Am)puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sommer: lucky @C's too..it MAY make!|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: but if they upgrade often - the syetm sh tell 14-17|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ndemirev: 14-30 i guess |pg||
nt|ndemirev: this lead may tip Zia to actually making it |pg||
nt|sommer: I think it's ok to upgrade with 5c's or 10's/9's|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: same sort of idea|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 1nt is flexible in their hands|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes specs have noticed 3NT makes|pg||
nt|thorvald: Hoping for 2 @d-honers blcoking|pg||
nt|brolucius: (2@C was game-forcing. The so-called two-over-one system).|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what conclusion can Zia draw from this lead?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ndemirev: We'll see :) this is Zia|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sommer: this is a walk in the park..N will probably take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there might be a few NS pairs in 3NT here - particularly if North starts 1NT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: Zia and his nose...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: a endplay against East will now work|pg||
pc|h5|nt|thorvald: Now 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: now 6@C would have been more challenging...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will come under pressure soon|pg||
nt|pelu: thats ok - but opp shuld be told |pg||
pc|s5|nt|sommer: @H@H now?|pg||

nt|sommer: yes, but S has no other option|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: if he cashes another spade now...|pg||
nt|xenya: missing an ace and the trump queen, but 9 trumps|pg||
pc|s7|nt|thorvald: Nah, still only 11 wrong position for the double squeeze|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ndemirev: i think it is coming very close to making|pg||

nt|ndemirev: Yes |pg||

nt|jtr: But you might bid it if East rebids 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: EW may bid game and not  make it here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Walsh means that you can respond in a 4-card major when you have longer diamonds.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|mamos: very restrained|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: north will backpedal furiously now|pg||

nt|thorvald: promising 4-card support, now Bocchi will bid the game|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sommer: I for sure expected E to bid 2NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  I never care for bids where the weak hand takes pd out of 3NT range|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Nystrom-Bertheau made 6@H on board 21|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as they are playing against the second-placed pair, that won't do them any harm|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|sommer: this is a "walk in the park"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|suketbombi: excellent contract|pg||
nt|jtr: Not a nice hand to play|pg||
nt|thorvald: But still spades are 3-3|pg||
nt|thorvald: and opps can make 2 @H so 1 down is not that bad|pg||
nt|jtr: But you block the @ds taking the finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: Sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that easy to defend either|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems right to play a @h through now|pg||
nt|thorvald: No you will play clubs trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|jtr: And let partner play another @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's minor-suit honours may look of dubious value to him, but in fact they will prove useful. |pg||
nt|jtr: In the USA a lot rebid one major not promissing @cs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sommer: 9 or 10 |pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: probably nine tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: EW lucky -- this time|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but he didnt like his 6 loser hand|pg||
nt|mamos: on previous board NS bid game on 24 withoiut blinking  seems very odd auction this board|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: Zia follow the same plan as Helness - and will be down 1|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact the last thing the defence want is an early @d ruff|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H shows a singleton|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia is trying to shorten declarer so he cant use the @ds|pg||
nt|jtr: But i rather think Welland will get endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: One of those hands where you know the exact shape at trick one|pg||
nt|brolucius: When the opener raises responder's major, it is possible that he has only three-card support. It is therefore important to have some sort of continuation that allows you to check ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: how many cards he has for you.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|sommer: ..11?:)|pg||
nt|sommer: last chance for @HK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|suketbombi: yes I was told stiff with many hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it can't be a bad plan, then|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sommer: it is right NOT to bid to hard on "white" games, but this was VERY cautious (read "too..)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|jtr: 4@s went down on 11 at the other table|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S here are using 2@S for that purpose.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sommer: W will have an open @C finesse now for 11|pg||
nt|jtr: Big catch up for Bocchi against the leaders|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ndemirev: this should make on normal play |pg||
pc|s8|nt|thorvald: Non-vulnerable you don't have as good odds for bidding borderline games|pg||
nt|jtr: Scores on http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Madala held only trhee-card heart support, he would bid something like 2NT or 3@C instead of 3@H. |pg||
nt|jtr: After the previous round|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c2|nt|sommer: was this good?|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like an easy one, yes|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there is a handling problem with both majors breaking badly|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Zorlu might be able to tell the exact shape of the defenders' hands after this trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think @sQ had been better than @s9|pg||
nt|ndemirev: at least it will be a fair assumption |pg||
pc|s7|pg||

pc|h8|nt|jtr: Welland needs to be careful about being endplayed|pg||
nt|thorvald: He cant ruff this one, but let partner ruff the next @D|pg||
nt|jtr: Another @s would have effected that|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and that´s why W should have played @sQ|pg||
nt|ndemirev: looks down now i think|pg||
nt|xenya: so the @SQ was MUCH better -- now or earlier|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: If he ruffs this and exits with the @cK the defence are stuck|pg||
nt|jtr: If Zia overtakes he ruffs|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: Zia is not happy:)|pg||
nt|jtr: A nice little hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Kokish loves those|pg||
nt|jtr: Sneak a @c through?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 3@c would be 6@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: South cannot bid 3@H vulnerable. He must judge whether a weak-two is a good idea.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: hmm this hand is also tricky|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: another straightforward game hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Notice the pass by Zia|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: A mighty club opener by Zia|pg||
nt|jtr: He wont be surprised by the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Madala is thinking and Bocchi points at the coleurs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: amazing, really - you hold two jacks in the endgame and get squeezed|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this may have its interesting points|pg||
nt|jtr: Horrible rebid|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|tez: 6@h is ok now.but very hard to find|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia is very disciplined with his opening bids|pg||
nt|jtr: Wise when you play with Welland:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why it's better to hold Aces, Mike:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I know - but I never get any of those|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: the last three or four times Ive watched there have been loads of eight and nine cards suits  the dealing machine seems to have  the balanced box ticked today|pg||
nt|roswolf: a choice og games|pg||
nt|roswolf: of|pg||
pc|d6|nt|thorvald: Not in 3rd hand as we have seen :-)|pg||
nt|jtr: 2NT not perfect but expresses the values well|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ndemirev: after this start it should be in play|pg||
nt|roswolf: a safe level|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: At matchpoints, North might bid 2@S. At IMPs he would be worried that partner could place him with a better hand. Stil, I think some players would bid 2@S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Partner cannot do much damage on a passed hand, even if he does think you have a better hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2@s would be @s+mi and 2@d is multi (NT-defense)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see. Thanks!|pg||
nt|jtr: AKA Reverse Cappelletti|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's not common in Chandlers Ford|pg||
nt|jtr: Banned i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can place the @DA with South because North did not overcall.|pg||
nt|jtr: @cK too probably|pg||
nt|jtr: But he cant afford to cross with a @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: @c2 in hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|sommer: 2@H was USP, I think|pg||
nt|sommer: =good @Sraise|pg||
nt|sommer: USP is short for Usefull Space Principle|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of a psychological trial for EW here. You go off in a reasonable slam and game, and then the opposition bid and make three games in a row   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: First prize in this event is 50,000 Danish Kroner, around 7,000 Euro, US$ 9,500|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy to get the impression that it's not your day|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sommer: 23 hcp but makeable game|pg||
nt|thorvald: He needs to pick up the spades, and cant afford to duck the hearts, so its ace, play spades, with a finess of north and using diamonds as an entry|pg||
nt|xenya: will probably go down though|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but will E ever find @SQ?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|mamos: MIke and I want some exciting hands  -- perhaps if all the specs cross their fingers ..................|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: 5@c 1/4 6@d is asking @d king|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|jtr: A spec spotted this play earlier|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sommer: guess not..my guess is -1 or 2|pg||
nt|mamos: not unless North carelessly drops it  !|pg||
nt|ndemirev: @S A, @HQ and @DK |pg||
nt|ndemirev: is good for 7|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: A diamond through the @DA (an avoidance play) will give him time to set up a spade too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  life would be easier for W if E had one the first @s and led back the Q@d|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: @CA - safe adainst ruff's by opp|pg||
nt|jtr: We have had Chandler's Ford now we have Morton's Fork|pg||
pc|d2|nt|thorvald: now he need an entry, and when he gets the count he cant make it|pg||
nt|sommer: no way home now|pg||
nt|jtr: @d ruff repeat finesse and claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: for standings after round 8 go to http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2730.html|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jtr: Maybe safer to cash the @s first|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: needs to finess for @hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can't do any real damage here |pg||
nt|mdgraham: segueing into NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Chandlers does not have an apostrophe I believe|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh it does|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @S partial offered the best chance but 2nt is practicle and defence will get a @H a@S and 3@CS|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sommer: right, Thorvald..wlc:)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Zia-Welland in this room next round|pg||
nt|sommer: IF you want to negleckt the rule of 9-never, you rather finess S for @SQ because of the opening, so the game was "unmakeable"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: against Zorlu-Assael, the leaders|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2725.html  for standings after round 3|pg||

nt|xenya: so the problem was not to bid 6 but to avoid bidding 7|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there were no inferences as to the @H Q one way or the other |pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: East claimed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do you have a new keyboard? Unlike you to use apostrophes.|pg||
nt|jtr: Especially for you|pg||
nt|brolucius: So kind.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In London they can't decide if it's Earls or Earl's Court|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I bought a new keyboard rather than another of your books|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ndemirev: One could argue Zia did open the bidding but that doesn't mean much |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: of course he was playing to make|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looking like a 3NT that will go down on a @h-lead|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2727.html  for standings after round 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 4@H sonn for S|pg||
nt|jtr: Welland operating|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: but otherwise it looks a normal 4@H contract|pg||
nt|ndemirev: So declarer did well to go with the apriori chances|pg||
nt|xenya: great set for Zia/Welland so far|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the last round today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 tomorrow, 4 Sunday|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..soon, even|pg||
nt|jtr: Earls i always thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: 1@C 16+ 1@D negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|pelu: in the "good old days" u could bid 3@D in W 9-11 - and but the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: vul isnt in his favour|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is idiosyncratic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure why 1NT - can open 1@C and rebid 1@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: 2@D presumably transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D 0-4 zz points|pg||
nt|mamos: Wse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: zz points: A=3, K=2, Q=1|pg||
nt|sommer: again, no real challenge..coffetime|pg||
nt|sommer: ruffingfinesse @D for overtrick after @HAK|pg||
nt|andyv:  shows the value of the hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sommer: this board belonged to EW:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but has been hijacked|pg||
nt|sommer: ..even a VERY lucky 3N dd:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala judges that he is too strong for a 2@S response to the take-out double. He shows his strength with a cue-bid.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mamos: sorry West thinking?|pg||
nt|pelu: and buy the board|pg||
nt|pelu: Board 12 - final contract in OR also 2@s - but played by EW - Zia in 3. seat open 1NT on his 1-2-4-6 hand and Roy aked for major|pg||
nt|pelu: down 3|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mamos: yes   maximum   and good tricks |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and more will come!|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- this does look like a partscore hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 11 tricks in @HS for e-w and wud get to the game|pg||
nt|jtr: he deosnt care about trivial matters like that:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might not play well|pg||
nt|thorvald: Whats the range for ventins 2NT. Partner bid a free 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Why lead @hs?|pg||
nt|jtr: Good question|pg||
nt|jtr: about the range i mean|pg||
nt|thorvald: What would 3 @S be then ?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: East knew keycards were missing|pg||
nt|peacokk: Nyström didn't cue a shortage in partners suit and they were at the same wavelenght, well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 2@S intervention seems very aggressive|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s are doomed now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: might make six on a non-club lead|pg||
nt|sommer: oooo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have. But you can win up to 40 more. The final score must add up to 80|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S would show around 8-10, in standard systems, but the fifth card in the major is worth at least 2 points extra.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2731.html  for standings after round 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, some would bid 3@S on that hand. |pg||
nt|jtr: For those that have sad lives- http://www.eleflat.co.uk/Earls_Court-65_SW5-info.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So you can get any result from 40-40 to 80-0. We did have a couple of 80-0's|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: again just the odd overtrick to be played for|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match at this table: Weinstein-Garner vs Blakset-Røn|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=transfer to hearts, 2N=transfer break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect 3@d=re-transfer, but not sure |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt must be a supper accept and 3@D a retransfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was told 2Nt also announced a min hand in their methods|pg||
nt|suketbombi: every card working overtime and Q ( of @CS in will make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Q9 of @Cs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sommer: pew|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia wants to look at trick 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: At the other table: Zorlu-Assael vs Bocchi-Madala|pg||
pc|s5|nt|thorvald: Does 2@D promise extra values as it suggest an offshape take-out double ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ndemirev: 4S here is a desaster on the layout. |pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S by S is for me an overbid - max 3@D = invit with @s-support|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S Ok - but 4@S - I dont understrand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next round at this table (20 mins past the hour): Helness-Helgemo  vs  Martens-Jassem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2728.html  for standings after round 6 |pg||
nt|roswolf: table speed is slowing down|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sommer: EW are playing a system called "Nusine@C"|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: I think a @h lead is the only way to make it, but looking at west hand a heart might be the only way to beat it, knowing partner has an ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heliocopter might be available|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point thorvald|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@d here has to be competitive, otherwise South may get frozen out with a strongish balanced hand|pg||
nt|peacokk: Not much in the play here, we all would score the 9 obvious tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as to the suit quality (and length) required, well...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sommer: Nusine was Blaksets cat..I think:)..must be dead for years now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, diamonds are 3-3 and there are the entries to set them up|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no can set up @Ds in isolation|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can bid 2@S otherwise, hoping that partner can rebid NT.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sommer: Tor will be unhappy with his 2@D:)..|pg||
nt|pelu: Martens can only see 8 tricks - but wjen he play @C - he will smile :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Only problem in 6@S is that Wrang has 4 hearts, so against the slam i think I would have lead the unbid suit - anyway this one will have no problems  11 trcicks ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: Oh|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|xenya: unfortunately S has no more diamonds -- if N had cashed the @DA first...|pg||

nt|jtr: How ever many, North will bid @ss|pg||
nt|jtr: Well maybe not over 6@h:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos: Nort is going to use some room|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose if partner ALWAYS made their contract i would forgive a few overtricks:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would bid only 3@H with that suit.|pg||
nt|xenya: E will raise?|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: on 14, where EW went down in 2@S here, Madala in the other room managed to make 3N -- quite an achievement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you D on E or bid 1nt?|pg||
nt|ndemirev: you can click on "movie" to review the played boards|pg||
nt|sommer: like 2@S X made?:)|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@d may get them to 5@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: Make it KQ10xxxx and I might be as adventurous as you.|pg||
nt|xenya: via 4@D|pg||
nt|thorvald: Only 4@S is secured, and now the double fit have been revealed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the last round today we get to see Bocchi-Madala vs Bertheau-Nyström at the other table. What a match, second against first! In about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|jtr: And, as a spec noticed, 5@s goes down|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@D is a fit-showing bid - obvious when he is a passed hand, and probably the same even if he were not.|pg||
nt|thorvald: A new partscore, I guess 2@s will be the final contract|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: as yes. Didn't see the Norht hand.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT-3NT looks good|pg||
nt|brolucius: West will have a tricky decision what to lead against a high club contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: the made 3NT at least one table ("OR") in b14, where E passed 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup:)|pg||
nt|sommer: again we saw an upgrade..this time from E|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but the 3 10's are ok to evaluate it as 12|pg||
nt|roswolf: north is fixed by 2nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: WEst isnt going to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: pity - would have been fun to see all the EW relays |pg||

nt|sommer: you are a fast typist!|pg||
mb|d|nt|sommer: ..easy to be faster than me:)|pg||
nt|sommer: hard for S to pass 2@S, but here it looks too tough|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks another minus score in the viking column|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not really Povl :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: looking for 5 card major or else 3Nt i gues|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Helness: 4@h i S has a chance|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzsh: Board 7|pg||
nt|thorvald: Claim :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: o:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, diamonds becomes more attractive than hearts, because you expect that suit to be ruffed early.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: not an exciting hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but 1NT=15-17, West investigates a possible club slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: now that is a view by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: i was about to say how should West make a slam try  he found a way|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical shot, 6@h - 7@H may be on but how to bid it if it is? |pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: might start with 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but sometimes it's not worth the strain|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the CC, it looks like West was finding out about a 5-card major|pg||
pc|s2|nt|suketbombi: yes that is what I thought|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be defeated - heart ruff, trump promotion on the @S10|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|thorvald: South would have bid 4@S with an ace and a king i think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: as West could have transferred to clubs |pg||
nt|suketbombi: strip squeeze for 11th trick:)|pg||

nt|thorvald: The first double probably showing 18-20 bal, and there is 21, but to me it looks bad|pg||

nt|sommer: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/NusineClubOpeningBids.html|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: well, it's something doubled, anyway|pg||
nt|mamos: well  it came to something doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just not by EW|pg||
nt|sommer: tough, but makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: East took one @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: the stiff @DK helps W|pg||
nt|suketbombi: to early for him to run the @H to T with so many chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most people hate leading from four to the jack - will South run it?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S/4@S 3@HS a @C + possible 2@DS may not run|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: It was easy?|pg||
nt|roswolf: to us palookas yes:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Unless 2@D was forcing to game.|pg||
nt|thorvald: He bid a free 2@H so he must have some values|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: with @HAK in S, he may even score an overtrick..but I think, he will try to make 8 first:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now he can count 3 spades and 4 clubs and a diamond, when NS dont start ruffing @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Zia-Welland missed the game in 14 (6 imp)|pg||
nt|sommer: ahh, ok|pg||
nt|jtr: Well did he bod a free 2@h?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: he opted for the bid which was closest to his cards i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Welland ask ab lead|pg||
nt|jtr: bid|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|ndemirev: 3D was a nice bid |pg||
nt|thorvald: Ofc depending on whether the transfer is showing values or just suit|pg||
nt|jtr: Advanatge of transfers there is that you can be weak or strong|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2@D is a transfer, that usually means that you are free to bid it on a weakish hand with hearts, as David implies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Madala is showing his @ss|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|suketbombi: Madala will dare not reyrn a @H:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|thorvald: with @hs 3-3 its makeable, but I don't think he will guess it|pg||
nt|ritong: double then @hs is not really attractive|pg||
nt|ritong: neither a direct 2@h|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@hs and exit @c?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jtr: But, as someone points out, 4@c maybe creates the game force|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: EW clearly seem to have misjudged   not clear what South's 2@D showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 2@d nat nf|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|suketbombi: return:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Helgemo has 10 6 in @h|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peacokk: Pass was probably forcing and DBL for penalties|pg||
nt|tez: defence has 6 trick in 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems not|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sommer: now @SAKQ and @C's|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|athene: quite a lot of work to do here|pg||
nt|dburn: standard Italian operating procedure - lead high from such as KQxx or QJxx if your third card is the eight or better|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: west might end up getting squeezed in the red suits here|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about the nine, though - and neither is Madala, or he would have continued the suit by now|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer plays a heart to the jack at some point and the defence cash their spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Say he gets one more spade to the ace and another, winning in hand. Diamond to dummy and a club finesse. But still not home|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts are favourable for the 9th trick but he does not know|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: "We could stop the tournament now -- and split the prizemoney - okay ???" asks Madala -- and Peter says "ok" :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How would you play, David?|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't think I would use an entry to dummy to finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i thought diamond to dummy, heart to jack, EW cash their spades then declarer plays @HA, heart to ten, club finesse and west gets squeezed|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|dburn: and I might play West rather than East for short hearts, by leading to the ten|pg||
nt|athene: yes heart to the ten possible but then you have a guess whether to play east for both honours or west to have ducked with Hx|pg||
nt|athene: leading to the jack at least avoids that dilemma|pg||
nt|dburn: but this discard from the table is awkward - he has some chance of three club tricks if the ten falls|pg||
nt|dburn: so he might just pitch a heart and play ace and queen of clubs, hoping for something or other|pg||
nt|dburn: and West will not find it easy to discard on that trick|pg||
nt|dburn: but he won't play anything quickly - this is a very messy hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spec suggesting that he pitches a club and exits with a spade to West|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: that is possible, but West could play a club without losing much if anything|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h3|pc|c6|nt|dburn: well, he played as I suggested, almost always a bad idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Win and a heart switch?|pg||
nt|dburn: but if Bocchi wins this trick, I don't see how Bertheau can make it|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: He can't because West still has an idle heart to pitch on @CJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: if you think spades are 4-3 there are two ways to look at it|pg||
nt|dburn: even if he knew the diamond position, it's still no good|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|athene: one is that west, with more spades, is more likely to be short in hearts|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: but the other is that if west led only a 4-card suit he is likely to be fairly balanced|pg||

nt|thorvald: No place to ace of @s in South so at the end it was easy to guess|pg||
nt|thorvald: If the transfer to 2@H can be weak, 4 @C cant be a Gameforce|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|xenya: last board now|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsh: yes TD are here|pg||
nt|sommer: ya, but Well done, Søren|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the bidding might get surreal now|pg||
nt|jtr: But North can show some values by bidding 2@s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tez: 1@s=1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 3NT is very lucky|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jtr: If Welland passes it wont be the same|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: Bocchi: ty pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 3NT can't make on best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But difficult to find|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but it is a practical try|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: If you are member off a Nordic Bridge Federation pls visit http://bbonordic.com/|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Next round at this table: Zia-Welland vs Zorlu-Assael|pg||

nt|Walddk4: in about 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|mamos: nice  sfae spot|pg||
nt|mamos: safe|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Thanks Mike Thanks to Soren for the great Job and Many thanks to all KIBS for their Comments|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Second that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @c5?|pg||
nt|thorvald: I dont think 3 nt are having any chances here, perhaps on a @H lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tez: last here..ty all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like declarer has to pin @d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty to Soren, our operator, to Roland, Mike, Thorvald and to all the specs who make this game so enjoyable.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ndemirev: It looked like East had done enough in the bidding before 5C |pg||
nt|ralfwil: by playing @dQ and after that @d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: 90|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry Dinner and after that going to a theatre!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry all, must go. See you later. Thanks all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: HE-HE are N/S|pg||
nt|pelu: If porblem with the board - then good that its a flat 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: np now for the players. Only for me:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start in 15 mins|pg||
nt|pelu: have u seen the - almost - killing lead? @s7 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: That would be fun:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bertheau led @CK and Røn dropped the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then came the switch, but a diamond|pg||
nt|jtr: Now @h@h @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: 20 opposite 4 does not play as well as 12 opposite 12, because you cannot move backwards and forward so easily.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S is a transfer to 2NT if opener has 19-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he hasn't he bids something else|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzsh: all alerted|pg||
nt|roswolf: well interesting sequence|pg||
nt|pelu: remember 2@H making by Helge - Bocchi-Madala bid and maded 3NT - a lot of right placed cards -: finess for @SJ - need 2 entries to dummy for the double-finess in @H |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the italians walked on water on that one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: After this round there will be a break for lunch. Restart at 15.40 Danish time, in 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|pelu: almost flying :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|peacokk: 1@H natural or relay, 1@S 4+@S 4+@C/@D i think|pg||
nt|andyv:  have some work to do here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: lots of bids  getting high|pg||
nt|mamos: albeit slowly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@h=natural or any hand that wants to use relays |pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy easy to make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: sorry all, must go. See you all tomorrow.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  bye Mike|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: 3@D better|pg||
nt|suketbombi: $@S was a good contract difficult to Judge the Right values|pg||
nt|roswolf: cool|pg||
nt|thorvald: He need to pick up the @d and play East for @HHx and Ace of @S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sommer: this 2@C is (in Italy at least) called Gazzilli|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slight surprise West passed over 1@S with @HKQx - maybe they don't play support doubles |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@S|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 tricks but Bocchi found a safe-play for 10 (if @ds 4-1!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: At the local club some would not notice the fall of the 10 and the 9, but Bocchi has eagle eyes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Last boardBocchi shows @s6|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzsh: Helness: If @d are 3-3 I make 5. Garner: Yes-yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now see you back in 10 minws|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: bye|pg||
nt|sommer: 3 times @H, @D and claim 11|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N looks quite reasonable here -- hopeless though because of the club split|pg||
nt|sommer: ..IF W accepts opposite 17+, he bids an art. 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Bye for now|pg||
nt|sommer: byee all|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: Last round today, that is|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am sure the players realised that most of the kibitzers are getting ready to watch Strictly Come Dancing on BBC1.|pg||
nt|thorvald: An ok set for Bocchi-Madala I think they will take the lead after this round|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks, Soren!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Nyström/Bertheau bid and made 3NT board 20. It is close|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|thorvald: Still looks makeable|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: cannot make now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  Q@s probably also works... I think S needed to win the 2nd @s and cash the Ace of clubs to have a chance|pg||
nt|thorvald: 3-squeezed|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a terrible game, looking at the EW hands -- but many might be pushed into it|pg||
