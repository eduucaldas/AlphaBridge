nt|bt: we have olympiad and bermuda bowl for teams|pg||
nt|bt: but i am in a minority no doubt, as usual, lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  The World Pairs was the original reason for this tournament, but the Rosenbloom, which began in 1978, seems to be gaining|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the Pairs should be more important|pg||
nt|bt: thx henry, lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  And I think they should shorten the Rosenbloom so it ends before the Pairs SF begin|pg||
nt|bt: true also, why the free tickets to the finals|pg||

nt|henryb:  yes|pg||
nt|bt: but never the olympiad?|pg||
