mb|p|nt|mrdct:  big double fit here for NS but only 10 tricks in 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the save in 5@c is likely which might push NS to 5@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: Asimple 4@H here... tough to reach?!?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: and he played it very fast ...|pg||

nt|mrdct:  gill might splinter in @h if available|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ian111:  a C at trick 2|pg||
nt|mrdct:  or introduce a clever psyche with a view to retreating to @c later|pg||

nt|mrdct:  1@h will just be showing 4+ @s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrdct:  whilst NS can be held to 10 tricks, that depends of a defence of two black aces at tricks 1 & 2|pg||

nt|mango joe: a good vul sacrifice if he gets @S right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  this looks to be one or two down - so a lost opportunity for australia|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west has perhaps already shown his hand with his 1@S bid and ought to have left the 5-level decision to compete to east|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|ian111:  as so often - no one able to double|pg||

nt|vicky888:  Hello all, hi mahesh :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Vicky|pg||
nt|mango joe: a 2@C opening in precision often has a  card major as it did in this case at the other table|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4 card major|pg||
nt|mrdct:  4@h for EW looks good here|pg||
nt|mango joe: he had a chance to test the @S and then perhaps guess if E had Kx or W had 10x @H|pg||
nt|mango joe: once @S didnt break|pg||
nt|mango joe: cards lie nicely for E/W here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  do you transfer to clubs with the South hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: we have a strong club |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: today the drinks are on the house ...by the organisers|pg||
nt|viren169: and one for you, no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is routine now |pg||
nt|vicky888:  Amazing start for Hemant Jalan|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mango joe: easy 3NT here for N/S|pg||
mb|d|nt|mango joe: 6@C and 6NT both make though very unlikely to be bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: We are in the wrong place!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: o|pg||
nt|vicky888:  light 3rd seat opening will need to take out to 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: still 11 boards to go|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: and I also will act as W now - non vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it is interesting, as it has to play three tricks better|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: That is a nice touch--wish they would do that here too  --well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Sandy Duncan is one of the most conservative bidders that I know ... a very solid and sound player|pg||
nt|mrdct:  stiff @cA is a little bit hard to evaluate - but west has nothing more to say than 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  @s lead best for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@sx pass interesting other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  the double of 4@c might have meant "don't lead a @c"|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|mango joe: another good board for Poddar|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a strong 1@C auction to 4@H here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure what 2@S was meant to achieve--3@H looked better--stronger than a direct 4@H |pg||
nt|viren169: just showing 4@S on the way - I guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: 11 tricks--next |pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: let @cK win|pg||
nt|paulg:  is Duncan still thinking?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks more like a deadlock:)|pg||

nt|mrdct:  2@h appears to show a @s suit|pg||
nt|mango joe: impossible to stay out of game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mango joe: esp in the last round of the round robin|pg||
nt|mrdct:  5@s might still make on a non-@c lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  opportunity for australia to win imps here as 6@s was reached in the other room by the forminables|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzat: system doesnt allow|pg||
nt|ian111:  beat wales25-5 to qualify for the semi of the commwealth|pg||
nt|ian111:  and then take gold|pg||
nt|mrdct:  east holding the dreaded stiff Ace of the opponents suit again - which is rarely worth full value|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: qualified for the semis by the skin of their teeth |pg||

nt|mango joe: missed a pass I think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|viren169: I have to admit I'm in the 1N-3N camp.|pg||
nt|garnetts: with AQxxx in a minor it will be 5 tricks a lot of the time and you should bid 3NT in my view because partner will never know that|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: For once we agree Gad |pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect this will a swing for Wales|pg||

nt|mango joe: this should mke unless he plays @S to K|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@H is not an odds on contract and will fail here unless declerer plays for a 4/1 @H after discovering 6/2 @DS|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|garnetts: oddly enough 2-1 scores here because it will start either with 1@D or 1@C and the 1NT response will show up to a about 11 and clubs which will shut east up for the right reasons |pg||
nt|suketbombi: Mahesh can we have the udate on scores?|pg||

nt|mango joe: @Hs are 3-3, @Cs are blocked, A@D is right & @S finesse is right|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: What would you have bid David with East's hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|suketbombi: @CT lead wod have been a hit:)|pg||
nt|mango joe: 3@S 4@H + 1@D shud be easy|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|paulg:  less good switch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|suketbombi: no more @S discard anal:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Duncan still needs to return a diamond otherwise it will disappear|pg||

nt|ian111:  Hemant |pg||
mb|4H|an|q|nt|ralfwil: This is a board, wher you have to choose betwenn 5 ot 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  it was close with about 8 boards to play, but ended up over 40 to Hemant|pg||
nt|mango joe: 2@H shows less than 4 points normally, its the weakest response|pg||
mb|5C|an|q|nt|paulg:  if North would bypass a 4-card diamond suit to bid 1NT, as many would, then pass is an option that would not work out well|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but Duncan-Gordon are pretty old-school and so retreating to clubs looks sensible|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  31 imps in 2 boards looks unlikely|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ian111:  needs a H guess and C finesse|pg||
nt|ian111:  could try 3NT and hope to avoid a H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s on E or do you show a 2-suiter? |pg||
nt|paulg:  a slam swing on board 25 has given Hemant Jalan some breathing room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i show two-suiters these days|pg||
nt|mrdct:  pretty much need two double game swings|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  in my system, it would be 3@c to show non-strong spades and clubs|pg||
nt|mango joe: puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Duncan's bid depends on their methods after a reverse ... some play 2NT as artificial (with weak hands)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now E? do you regret only 1@s?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzat: yet to get a push board|pg||
nt|ian111:  not easy to bid the thin but good 5C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mrdct:  it would take a horrible defence to let NS make 5@d here - not that they are at all likley to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: arun jain 117- magic eyes 78|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  3NT probably suggests a weak club stop|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Gordon has nowhere to go .. he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: usually the weaker hand bids the major he doesnt have |pg||
nt|ian111:  4S by E might make on CJ lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  are the results on the web anywhere?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzat: see hcl website|pg||
nt|mrdct:  both 5@c and 3NT depend on the @s hook|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  this should be beaten on a club lead, as long as West does not cover the @sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  given West's poor spade intermediates, this should be easy to avoid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  this will play well with the doubleton club with north and the @d10 preventing a force|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c is much easier than 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Ian|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ian111:  hi |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|paulg:  not an easy lead for East to read, although to beat the contract he has little choice about playing West for an honour|pg||
nt|paulg:  or playing West for 98xx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mango joe: at least the @H guess was easier|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the HCL website only seems to have hte results up to round 9 of the swiss|pg||
nt|mango joe: he will know Q@S and a key card is missing so will stop in 5 probably|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
