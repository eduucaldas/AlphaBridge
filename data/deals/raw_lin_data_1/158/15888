pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: S surely having shown his stiff club on the way|pg||
nt|henryb:  or go down 1 when declarer ducks this to his Q|pg||
nt|xenya: might go down on this lead?|pg||
nt|bt: i wouldnt formulate it like that in english jon|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is a 3 or 5 play|pg||
nt|bt: but i have a dirty mind|pg||
nt|jbgood: it is - contract will be the same all over the room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
pc|c2|nt|heyz:  most fields you would try to make as many tricks as possible|pg||
nt|heyz:  this one an exception?|pg||

pc|cA|nt|mrt2000: 7 tricks, next hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|henryb:  If N goes up with the A he can draw trumps and pitch a @h on the @cK. making 5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|heyz:  well predicted|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: i think 80% will go down - N must have gotten a clue from the speed of the lead|pg||
nt|xenya: better perhaps to win the Ace, having avoided a @H lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: more interesting on a @D lead, perhaps?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|heyz:  a whistler as we call it in USA|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: sorry, it was double after 2@c|pg||
nt|iceking: it works like this, if you dont have a @C stopper you pass and pd starts another stayman with rdbl|pg||

mb|3C|nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d multi|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  I suspect the stiff will be the normal lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|heyz:  West has an easier lead than East vs @s contract|pg||
nt|bt: u have 2 know ur opps to duck that in dummy|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - and the question is how many try to take a double advantage (that isnt there)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N and W = she|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|heyz:  solves any lead problems|pg||
nt|bt: now the question is, does north know his pds style?|pg||
nt|jbgood: weak weak in spades being the text here - n has a guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  I feel sure that he does|pg||
nt|heyz:  kib says this could be misinterpreted as t/o for @ss|pg||
nt|bt: a guess?|pg||
nt|heyz:  the dbl|pg||
nt|jbgood: that must be an odd interpretation - this is a normal suit showing double|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: N asking E what the double means. East stating, I am not sure.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: heavyweight 2NT overcall|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzrk: 3@d not alerted|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: hardly a takeout -- W could double before|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 3@d not discussed|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT doomed, I fear|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|mrt2000: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|tejjyid: So, do you assume transfers are safe in undiscussed auctions?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: could hsve been much worse  though|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d bad weak 2 in a major or balanced 23/24|pg||
nt|peachy: he can take his eight and give up|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I personally think it's crazy, but I observe myself to be in a minority|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I'm with you  :)|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps without the misunderstanding, they would play in 4H|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H practically laydown, and they're in 3NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also, you have to assume if your system is 4 card majors, strong NT, that you are heavily oriented to natural bids|pg||
nt|peachy: NS sat down just before gametime and made a card, I was told. They dont usually play together (although did play in Norway sometime in the past)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This is actually an interesting question in big pickup environments like BBO, where you rarely have detailed discussions|pg||
nt|peachy: I make the blanket agreement with all partners that systems on, makes life simple|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and avoids mistakes like this too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Artur in the tank|pg||
nt|peachy: it has some flaws but avoids misunderstandings|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, system on covers a multitude of situations|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  West still has to find the @c shift|pg||
nt|jbgood: a very careful 3@s - but 3@d bid got defense to a nice start - conventions sometimes give away leaddirecting doubles|pg||
nt|henryb:  otherwise declarer can still make five|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Artur may surface and make the best of it, I think !   lol|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: People could just open 1@S on anything in 3rd because they knew partner could bid no more than 2@C (Drury)|pg||
nt|iceking: w to continue over 2@S is really marginal with such a week suit|pg||
nt|rmb1: It really quite a long while ago, although there was still some suspicion when I started TDing on such matters|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think North is a little weak for 2@s. the @sKJ cannot get full value after the opening bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzrk: But not David|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: But if it did then 3Nt would be a slam try with no shortage!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: its not like 2@S will get you to game automatically|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Right, you can't stop in 3@S if opener has a doubleton, but how often do you want that?|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|henryb:  true. but sometimes their partners are very short|pg||

nt|vugraphzsx: yes, S claimed for 10 tricks.|pg||
