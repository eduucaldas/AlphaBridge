nt|Walddk2: Yeah, and also tomorrow and Sunday|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3S!|nt|iceking: no neg free-bid for Zia and Welland |pg||
nt|iceking: i guess over the years it has become less popular|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: "I now believe in the theory that the first board is deciding the tournament" says Zia :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzsg: "you are sure you dare RD" Zia asks -- everyone laughs :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least this is clearly for takeout|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|davpro: must be a negative double|pg||
mb|4H|nt|iceking: not sure why he needs to rdbl here|pg||
mb|d|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: 4NT = 4@c and 6+@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: spade lead and club switch is best but they can't beat it|pg||
nt|davpro: Didn't Zia play 4N as blackwould in all situtation when he was young (not implying he is old) ?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: best lead a @D|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Automatic from Qx|pg||

pc|sA|nt|sharkey: Still has to guess trumps|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|iceking: does Zia open this S hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11, 5 controls, sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: good 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that not an opener to everyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: yes. 653=body :)|pg||
nt|iceking: would think so|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Not to Zia|pg||
nt|iceking: but iam not suprised he passed|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|vugraphzsg: dbl=4 or 5@s|pg||
nt|davpro: he might think that he needs something extra if P is in his redoubling mood :)|pg||
nt|iceking: yes:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: I am asked about controls. A = 2 controls    K  =  1 control|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: will they get to 4@H now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough|pg||
nt|davpro: no (imho)|pg||
nt|pelu: exp only 3@H from Zia|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: The problem with not openeing Zia's hand is to justify it later|pg||
nt|davpro: Good opening from W and S ought to have opened (once again imho)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|iceking: well 4@H does not always make|pg||
nt|iceking: like on @D lead do you make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: "it is dangerous to open light today" said Zia when he lay down the dummy|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - but VUL in an IMP game you probably want to be there?|pg||
nt|iceking: sure i have a feeling they will be the only pair in this field not in game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eight tables in play so the result you see from the other room is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 boards per round|pg||
nt|pelu: there are a VP-scale on the IMPs - from 40-40 til max = 80-0|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The score is 40-40 when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have|pg||
nt|davpro: -1600 is probably not 40-40|pg||
nt|davpro: forget my last comment (forget all my comments?)|pg||
nt|iceking: been told 4@H makes on @D lead is this correct|pg||
nt|pelu: more likely 7 x 14 IMP = - 98 IMP :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is there a cap for the winning team too or can they win as many IMPs as available?|pg||
nt|iceking: you play what 3 rounds of @S pich a @D as W ruffs in now @H @H and dont you have 2 @C losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Zia asks for the Bulletin -- and starts reading about the Pro-Am yesterday|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He came 3rd?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 4th|pg||
nt|davpro: double dummie: duck a @c trick two...won't that do the trick?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: He is on the page with the Headline "Keep it simple" -- and shows it to his partner :):)|pg||
nt|iceking: on a @D lead then you have 2 @H losers or|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great to have Jan here to tell us what is going on at the table. It's almost like being there yourself. Well done, Jan, keep it up!|pg||
nt|pelu: here is the link to the bulletin: http://www.copenhagen-bridge-invitational.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=4&Itemid=4|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|Walddk2: club to dummy, spade to the queen, club ruff, @SK|pg||
nt|iceking: yes 10|pg||

nt|mdgraham: There are eight tables in play, so the result you see from the other room is just one of seven comparisons|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: a @c return from W and only 11 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|an|FG|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2NT is presumably forcing - a modern-ish treatment |pg||

nt|geot: Heart from west is best now|pg||
nt|geot: or ells declarer will ruff a club and lose only one club and two trumps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead seems better for the defence. looks makeable now|pg||
nt|geot: If Bjarnarson switches to a trump, declarer is in trouble unless he plays low from north|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: agree, but declarer can play low |pg||

nt|vugraphzsg: It was not alerted at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: the 3@d bid|pg||
nt|pelu: to tell pd that he has good @Hs|pg||

nt|davpro: We sure do :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I guess we have to agree that we are getting some very interesting boards at this table !:)|pg||
nt|davpro: if he exits with a @h E will be squeesed on the @hs|pg||
nt|iceking: i like the bidding in the closed room |pg||
nt|iceking: yes and Zia will probably read this |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Weinstein is taking a lot of time here -- and has put the cards at the table|pg||
