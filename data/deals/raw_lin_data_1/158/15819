nt|vugraphzsg: This is the PRO-AM tournament |pg||

nt|hardkxre:  Christians is short for SÃ¸ren Christiansen|pg||
nt|oleberg: This board might give us a little action|pg||
nt|hardkxre:  one of the best Danish players|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: There is some problems with the Bridgemates -- so a short break !|pg||
nt|ricoh:  NS can make 3C or 3D and EW 2S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: All the pairs have been sent back to there positions in Round 1|pg||
nt|ricoh:  NS will not be succesful in a NT-contract, wich will be tempting|pg||
nt|oleberg: The bridgemates will probably soon be as good as new|pg||
nt|hardkxre:  it's not unlikely that North will end up declaring 1NT|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|oleberg: A little bloodless from both East and West, but a NT-bid behind the overcall is always a warning sign|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|babydolldk: It looks like one down - but easy for us to see|pg||
nt|hardkxre:  he needs to sneak a diamond past SC|pg||

nt|vugraphzsg: Welcome also to Roland Wald :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|hardkxre:  that old rule "third hand high" just gave declarer an extra spade trick|pg||

nt|ricoh:  antoher good board for Gus and Hanlon|pg||
nt|hardkxre:  a good board for Hanlon-Gus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, this is Gus Hansen, the poker player. I am getting a few private messages about that|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|oleberg: On the friendly lay of the cards, 6@S is on for EW|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ricoh:  EW can make slam on this one|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ricoh:  but it is impossible to get there|pg||
nt|oleberg: Good 2@H bid by gus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think we have had a Pro/Am broadcast on BBO before. So, if nothing else it's nice to have one for a change|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hardkxre:  ouch|pg||

pc|h2|mc|12|nt|Walddk2: Just your everyday score, 1190|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: 2@c = Stayman|pg||

nt|hardkxre:  Dorte Krak has seen Sabine play before|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hardkxre:  but gave up in the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: 3@H is probably forcing with spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: By the way, Tom Hanlon is not only a world class bridge player, he is also an excellent poker player|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His regular bridge partner is Hugh McGann|pg||
nt|hardkxre:  it was just pointed out to me, that Sabine is using an old psychological trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Now we have 8 minutes before the next Round -- Next EW pair: Christina Lund Madsen and Erik Saelensminde|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's cheating|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Christina is not an amateur|pg||
nt|hardkxre:  her convention card is wrapped in green which indicates the lowest masterpoint title in Denmark|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: She bought the Pro :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: so she is an AM in this tournament|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can also get a brown cover for your CC, meaning that you don't have *any* title|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So she must know a few things if her colour is green|pg||
nt|hardkxre:  13 i alt|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I have had a misinformation from the TD|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Indeed but difficult when you have a 5-4 fit in a major|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
