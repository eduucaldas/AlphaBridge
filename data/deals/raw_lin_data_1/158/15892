nt|sybarra: hello David and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi aLL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: s IS HLFWY BETWEEN MIXED AND LIMIT RAZE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E overcalls as expected, expect N to be bullish|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention card for NS is available under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26/Australia.aspx|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Team Horwitz has 5 youngsters  - and Horwitz|pg||

nt|ahollan1: David -- that was much better comeback than what i was typing|pg||
nt|super nova: 2d = Hearts or the black suits.|pg||
nt|super nova: TWERB= two way exclusive relay bid.|pg||
mb|2D!|an|5+h inv|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
nt|super nova: Two way because you have either the suit above or the two suits below.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
nt|super nova: Normally I would like to have a 6th. for the bid.. but the hand shoudl be worth one bid.|pg||
nt|super nova: It is part of a convension called TWERB|pg||
nt|super nova: Exclusive because you bid the one suit you dont have which is often the opps suit.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
nt|super nova: Relay because your partner makes a relay to find out what you have typically.|pg||
nt|super nova: Pitt team had a 3 imp carry forward,|pg||
nt|super nova: but they lost the first set 47 - 0. so they were quite behind.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|super nova: The second set Pitt team won 47 to 13.. seems that 47 is having a role to play in todays match.?|pg||

mb|p|nt|loganrun: Hi all for the final set|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Prescott-Noble-Bilski in whatever combination play play what's called Modified Polish Club|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Klinger has always struggled with counting points|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: This is the final of the Sydney National Open Teams (SNOT)|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|vugraphA2: Playing 4 x 16 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really have very little resemblence to Polish Club |pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Al and specs|pg||
nt|loganrun: A slam in hearts or NT as long as you play the diamonds in the appropriate way|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough for North; 3@D not quite enough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but X too risky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he has a 7th @H to make up for the suit quality :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: and for your future viewing plans, full vugraph schedule with all times local to you is found here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for non-americans, adam west played Batman on TV, and Joe south was a country singer (games people play)|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think the operator may fill those in, though Adam West would be great to see|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Bill is West and Paul is South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he also sang the classic "dont it make you wanna go home?"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much response from Neill only 16 highs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Hi Chris|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Welcome to a wet windy cold rainy sydney day|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Seniors Teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: North probably thinking about 6@D - assuming 3@S is a raise|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: BW - the simple answer to all slam questions|pg||
pc|sK|nt|loganrun: Hi David - a suuny Melbourne welcomes you|pg||
nt|loganrun: sunny|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oooo   Andy is playing with Nabil     in the PABF it was Andy-Adam|pg||
nt|super nova: Seems like a relatively routine hand.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Yes this is an irregular partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Prescott had an opening bid option with 5+/5+ @H & @S   so  this 2@H probably [keyword] implies 5/4|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok Ron is clearly a NT-o-phile, last hand 1NT with 5 good hearts, now 1N rebid with 6 hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the @H game missed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugrapha2: not sure what 5@h is|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: or 3N or 4N :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: South has a max. with good trumps - there must have been a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and claims|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW carding   standard count & attitude   odd/even 1st discard|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|peachy: Prescott caught a pretty nice dummy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: ron understandably treating his hearts as a 4.72 card suit on second round, then accordioning the out to 5.6 on next round|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: @S 3-3 is pretty friendly too|pg||
pc|dA|nt|loganrun: Declarer has got himself a bit tangled up here|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Bit is very charitable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Noble won the Qualifying -- that accounts for their 11 imps|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|d5|nt|peachy: the only remaining consideration is to not lose more than two trumps|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|djneill:  8 tricks looks easy but 9?|pg||
nt|djneill:  must rely on his one Ace up his sleeve, the fact opponents think he has 5 hearts, not sure if it can be done|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how the new partnership would treat North's 2nd DBL instead of the chosen 3@D|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hK|pc|d8|nt|djneill:  it is hard for me to think outside the box on defense, if declarer made a "judgement", defense is hard enough|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's the last time i'll copy/paste THAT|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh yeah -- 1@C was 1-Round Force|pg||
mb|2C|nt|super nova: 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: an excellent hand to defend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can make a case for X rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand is a breather...|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes, Marshall would you have responded 3NT on this North hand?  It is close|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: notice Nabil's 1@S -- in preparation of showing @H if he gets a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is exactly the kind of hand that defends the case; playale in 3 suits, why not tell partner about it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this might have been a good time to try an offbeat mini-splinter  [showing 9-12 HCP]   but Whibley is there anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: would you play clubs thru West to create a swing here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally you wouldn't expect to see  the 4@S bidder with an ace|pg||
nt|loganrun: South punting here - could be off 2 controls here|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|peachy: we are fortunate to have al here to explain all the bids|pg||
nt|peachy: when I am kibitzing, I appreciate that a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice "all" is spelled with small letters|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: not for .05 second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: or it wasnt apparent|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H being NF, he understandably shose the trump contract|pg||

nt|loganrun: The club pitch in the end swayed him to go wrong|pg||
nt|lml: looks like a lot of clubs east-west|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|lml: but one minor problem|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+@D|pg||
nt|lml: looks like 6NT would make east-west if you can get there|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid suggest the right line of play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-16 HCP, 5+@H, unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout at 2-level   i assume that also applies at 3-level|pg||
nt|djneill:  West ducked the @d as the only chance to set, but also to stop a squeeze from operating sometimes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tejjyid: nothing can tell u how much i hate opening 1@d n rthe West ards|pg||
nt|lml: do you like 3NT?|pg||
nt|super nova: Djurovic is a bit top heavy for 3nt.|pg||
nt|lml: way|pg||
nt|super nova: I would start with X to see which way things are going.|pg||
nt|lml: but Evans may not pass |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a very makeable but thin 4@S NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: oh 5d is an excellent bid on this hand.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|peachy: Apparent takeout since it was pulled|pg||
nt|djneill:  :-)  Paul Lavings (West) may play slower now for you Judy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could miss a laydown 6C even facing PH, or play doomed 3N with 5C spread|pg||
nt|djneill:  well, North cooperated by not transferring, this looks a little odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  unless not play transfers|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: l in 2 spadesBruce transferred and Pau;|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that description actually covers 1@D, 1@H & 1@S opener's  filling in the correct suit for the 5+|pg||
nt|djneill:  astuted of the caped crusader|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Paul stuffed up - thank goodness|pg||
nt|djneill:  right, if minors were reversed might get a lead-directing double of stayman (@cxx)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cannot approve 1NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugrapha2: not clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even so -- with 4333 converting to penalty had to be an option|pg||
nt|super nova: oh.. but that was b/c it now gave East another chance.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: lots of work for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: This hand looks tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead|pg||
nt|peachy: but he might manage to make it, provided he does not start on clubs early on|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is that you cant make a minor slam which is certainly a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|lml: so this might work out well for east-west|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S has a 1C opener|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: still, it's in the textbook & it has worked as advertsed here.|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: on the auction - he was NEVER going to play for both reds to be 33 with preemptor holding @HQTx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hung still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming upside-down count/attitude for NS --- @D continuation is expected  -- but no need to rush without thinking|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Noble was to bidding 4@H instead of 3@H   that would have been interesting |pg||
nt|vugraphA2: And Hung wearing his traditional cap making it harder to see his reactions|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Andy|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|loganrun: All the action is with South at the moment and his mental toughness is tested with 2 slam decisions|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: Same score likely maybe doubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they printed that because each NCBO [National Contract Bridge Organization] is allowed to set rules about who can/can't ask|pg||
nt|peachy: It was a difficult hand to play, but leaving 3SX in would have been worse, it might have well made|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|lml: it looks like you can make about 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another multi-purpose 1@C probably better than PASS|pg||
nt|loganrun: 6H from West - that is mentally tough!|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugrapha1: x means stength|pg||
nt|djneill:  West may want to bid here, for surely East is never leading a @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|vugraphA2: What would you bid here as south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opener is weak [another non Polish Club treatment] that allows 5@H/@S -- but apparently not 5422|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok transfer overcall, allows West to shape out with interesting hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||
nt|lml: andeast-west should push north south to the 3-level.|pg||
nt|yr: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@H from west wide range opposite a limited 1@H opener|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: A club ruff is a trick the defence would get anyway likely declarer will lose 1-1-1-1 for one down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Any other Vul I would have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  right you are South doubled 2@h for takeout|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think W should raise to 3H to make it tougher|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|yr: 2@d looks like the precesion type with short @d &11-15 hcp|pg||
nt|yr: 2@h was some relay |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: 1@D is the ONLY positive response  shows any hand with 6+ HCP|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Pass was a mirage Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm more into hallucinations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry,  1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|tejjyid: should be no trouble to bid 4@H now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Oh!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: for west or east?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think WEst can bid the 4th without fear of criticism|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if the rest of the boards will be this flat|pg||
nt|loganrun: oops - who can blame North?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fact of not redoubling marks 3H by W as competitive|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: David -- you get encouraged at other vulnerability when partner passes twice??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's true the 4441 is a bit sterile, but, overall, that's a big hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, with 9 card fit it blossoms|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: sorru I missed something|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: I think Evans might have competed to 3@D.  She is NV and you have to fit a bit for the partscore|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s5|nt|tejjyid: I',m sure East would have rasied with the @DA in plce of the K, or a singleton somewhere, but it's hard to say that this hand necessitated it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Andy Hung seems to be on Michael Prescott's side this hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: have we had a straight forward hand yet?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS can console themselves there with the reflection that on the chosen line, even 1S was going down|pg||
nt|lml: I guess even 2 was not trivial|pg||
nt|lml: south could have made it right up to the end by discarding at trick 11|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|peachy: I was thinking the same, lots of decisions both sides|pg||
nt|djneill:  100 honors would change the modern scoring landscape|pg||

nt|ahollan1: seems they've all been see-saw between declarer and defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no danger of getting too high now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphA2: Andy's 2@D bid may have hidden the 4/4 spade fit although Nabil may "reverse" now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is standard weak 2  --  no multi-2@D or 2-suited 2s for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: north choices interesting   PASS, DBL, 2@D |pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Or 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Depending on methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on the diagrammed hand i mean|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: this doesn't llok too difficult, I'm going for coffee|pg||
nt|yr: Muller has the(unwanted) reputation of being one of the slowest players in the world!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphA2: I assume the double suggested 4 spades and likely only four diamonds so not sure about 4@D bid by Andy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barry Noble seems to always have 4522 shape in support of partner's @H bids  - i wonder if that is systemic|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil thinking about bidding on but I suspect he wont|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Hmm 4@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tried to bid 1S but not allowed:)|pg||
nt|lml: the idea is that if you get to a slam that has a 5% chance and it makes you lose moral imps (But gain real ones) :)|pg||
nt|yr: after 4nt i cant see S stopping at the 5 level|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Lavings   asks 5@H/@S AND size|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Haughie has an absolute max nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now 6@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only if they think you have to be very weak rather than just very offensively oriented. and in any case they wont bid one if they dont fiind a fit they are confident is adequate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if you dont expect to make can bid it, they probably sacrifice|pg||
nt|tejjyid: here NS have given EW too much room|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: pd is balanced and S will be motivated to pass the double on a lot of shapely hands|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: @d's 3-3 and Q2@H all nice|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: i started playing weak or kamikaze NT 35 years ago -- i'm sure i NEVER discussed East's sequence of the delayed 3@H|pg||
nt|yr: its natural to finnese they @h q right after the preempt & that shd be enough to make 5@h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphA2: But .... Pass= Penalties or two touching suits|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: So 3@H showed majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what strength??|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If Nabil finds a diamond lead this will be BAD|pg||
nt|peachy: landed well with that action|pg||
nt|lml: do you know what East meant 1@s to be?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: right. and no matter what E showed, why couldnt it go all pass after the double?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does W always RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll bet PASS not only showed the 2 options -- but was also FORCING|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Because presumably West must act|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that lets NS escape when they have a runout spot and u were making|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Redouble on the basis it is penalties or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if overcalling 1@C has changed now that transfers are used over 1@C-P and 1@C-DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S might have bid 4D for example|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|djneill:  what if East opened 1@s and South bid 2@h|pg||
nt|lml: it looks like a transfer to 1NT but it wasnt alerted|pg||

pc|c3|nt|frankaus: maybe a transfer advance = 1C|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how could defense stop that after the @D lead?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly for Southy the thoughtful 3@D bid has turned into information that makes West very confident abloutslam|pg||
nt|frankaus: the sping nationals in its 9th day  - 60 a day  - for some - |pg||
nt|lml: On Board 5 where Kalmin didn't untangle the play in 2@H the other table made an overtrick and so won 6 more imps|pg||
nt|frankaus: spring|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry abput not alerting but her friend is supposed to bwe doing that|pg||
nt|yr: sad result after they reached an exellent contract|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|marlowepi: the method played by EW for 1N X Pass seems theoretically questionable because it giuves the opps the whole two level when E is 2 suited|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E has a 2 suited runout, the n it is fine, but withg a hand that might produce a game ui think a different call is in order, e.g. 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: On the 4@S going down 2 and you asked what the result at the other table might be 5@H -2 and 9 imps to Noble|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Both sides need to avoid trouble on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Sorry 5@HX -1|pg||
nt|tejjyid: illustrates the theme that bridge is ablout balancing information for partner & info for opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is multi-purpose  and  1-round force |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 10-20, 5440, 4+@C  b) 12-21, 4@C(441)  c) BAL, 21-22 or 25-26|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a surprising outcome for that bid when LHO has opened 2C. still it might have been the key to the city if LHO was slated to end in 3N and had a spade tenace|pg||
nt|lml: no worries as you say|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|frankaus: 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not keen on 2N with so much playability in spades, even though pd is a PH|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, it's only the huge EW fit that makes it fraught|pg||
nt|djneill:  meanwhile back in the real world, the other table stopped in 2NT on brd 18 after East chose to rebid hearts rather than NT|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: you bewdy glad yu do|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|ahollan1: for those who like to see very long descriptions     1@C=a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Anybody for 1@S now by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting second action by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S is privy to the info that E mnight have a stiff spade, then yes|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: prescott looks at 4@D incredulously|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D would be right shape for a weaker hand than the 3@H rebid|pg||
nt|peachy: this would be a tricky hand to bid in any system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A+ for your homework Al.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: East looking puzzled|pg||

pc|dA|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Haughie dropped 5h on Club lead - not happy|pg||
nt|yr: ruffing a @d  brings the total to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: noit without play|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil knows Mike likely has a penalty double of 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously -- there were more tricks available in @D than declarer will see in @C|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unbalanced real suit is my guess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: standard-ish|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok good info thank you Judy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|frankaus: pushy 3NT may need some assstance from the defence|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: Nick -- tell them they both remembered incorrectly :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: natural-esque|pg||
nt|lml: well the club return was a killer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|djneill:  so South is playing on the fact West must play the penalty card on the first @h, even if he holds the @hK!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if N id unsure what 5H means, what he does knwo uis that almost all his strength consists of cards that S probably doesnt care about since only red suits have been bid|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: in this case a club lead seems a better bet than a heart lead in my view|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case i mean|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: all N has is a fifth heart, but it does not feel like enough. after all S did not opoen 2C. in fact S indeed did even HAVE a 2C opener, yet slam was hopeless, so that says it all|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Reese describes a set of hands where raising the overcall with a Doubleton honour is best; this seems like one|pg||

mb|4S|nt|lml: east-west wimped out so it was not a question at this table|pg||
nt|frankaus: they found the X ruff in 6@C|pg||
nt|super nova: This shows a forcing 6 card heart suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: I cant believe North is thinking here|pg||
nt|peachy: the moment.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS may be playing rosenkranz X & XX so forced to XX to show an honor, which a raise over the double would deny|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3H is forcing|pg||
nt|lml: some wires got crossed|pg||
nt|super nova: But it seems that east doesnt like their hand.|pg||
nt|lml: east-west do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand I cant see what they can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they make 3NT??|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.|pg||
nt|yr: splinter means that your values are in @h & @c,,,jsut wat S wanted to hear|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: now simple Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: that decides the fate of the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now maybe an overtrick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid 2@C as well|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as in 'it is not clear what they make'|pg||
mb|5S|nt|marlowepi: why would this EW auction ven be forcing? ne of the problems with an initial double|pg||
nt|djneill:  with various checkbacks available, the jumps may be forcing|pg||
nt|djneill:  3NT was odd however|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i mean, from W point of view why would 3C be forcing?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm suprised @C was adequate|pg||
nt|yr: but of course he has a minimum forcing @c & tries to sign off,,,,but N wont let him off the hook here|pg||
mb|6S|nt|marlowepi: not that odd -- 11 of his 14 points are in unbid suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: he is thinking how lucky he is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice pressure bid|pg||
nt|lml: not clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: amazing pass, given the @D Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the D flaw ntwithstanding|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes it depends if West is looking for slam potentially since East has a slam oriented hand with a @s cue|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|nickd:  yes splinter was possible even without Qh|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but probably just make|pg||
nt|yr: very well bid slam in the end,,,its a claimer|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|peachy: he needed just one heart trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is possible that 3N there was a spade cuebid, allowing them to use the step bid of 3S as a grope of some sort|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H = likely + will prob be a + imps as well|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: just delaying the inevitable claim for 9 tricks ??|pg||
nt|lml: they do have to make it though|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: 2c was puppet to 2d i think, but the pass is simply not consistent|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best lead to give defense a chance was king of clubs. looks absurd of course but it is amazing how often it is right from this holdiong|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: seems to be on the right track|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: when in dummy  I think trump gives play for overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using 2@C opening this way, they can actually get out in 2@H/@S via transfers   interesting concept|pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazing is an amazing euphemism:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: the defense is not going to work out for north-sotuh|pg||
nt|lml: north with the long trump ruffed a loser|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: ha go that onetra ltra lA|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: in theory as well as practice, i think spade ace is best lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: Hearts are 3-3.. luckily.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: too many values to hope for big enough club holding -- where will u get 4 tricks without a ruff?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N will conced a D and EW will try to figure out a plan with a hope|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tejjyid: yes, best chance for ruff |pg||
nt|fabsayc: at least that is a plan|pg||
nt|super nova: with 4-2 in hearts on spade pumps it could be  a real mess.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|frankaus: zar points - link - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|lml: its not that there aren't enough points.  2@S in third is tactical|pg||

nt|yr: 4 obvious losers here|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: before you ask the answer is YES|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another transfer explanation|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok South doubles the completely artificial 2@d bid to indicate some strength, some play it shows balanced, some a takeout of a major in particular|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will NS go on over 4S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Another 'percentage' action|pg||
nt|lml: on Board 9 the defense lost their way a bit and 3NT made.  Declarer ran 4 hearts and West through a club which was fatal|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: OK, I have to go, but that should raise the average standard of the commentary|pg||

nt|super nova: North decides to show their 6-5 shape. fair enough.|pg||
nt|super nova: Ace of diamonds and diamond continuations I would imagine to be the best defence.|pg||
nt|lml: on a non-diamond lead the diamond can go away|pg||
nt|super nova: With the east hand you want to pump declarer.. and D is the unbid suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we have seen a plethora of singleton Kings this match|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: holey moley - suh 8magination|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 10 cold anyway it would seem|pg||

pc|s4|nt|vugrapha2: 3 on the one board was my fav.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 fell to the Ace -- but the 3rd snuck through to beat the contract|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mrace: i won't be surprised if S opens 1 nt|pg||
nt|mrace: he did :)|pg||
nt|drewsky: Seems like its either a 1NT opening, or @C followe by 3@C, which seems like an overbid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: that will shorten the auction again|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrace: thats true|pg||
pc|h6|nt|drewsky: I will tell you this: that modern bidding theory has expanded the 1NT opening bid to many many more hands then was in years past|pg||

nt|mrace: if he plays @C which i think he will...ugh !|pg||
nt|drewsky: The only way to make it was to double finesse daimonds through east, and the only way to do that is to have hand the hand records in advance|pg||
nt|mrace: yes|pg||
nt|mrace: but even then, Drew, he has to come up with a good story for that choice of line to TD :)|pg||
nt|mrace: i am afraid this may go down 4 |pg||
nt|drewsky: Well, that is why it is so difficult to cheat at bridge. If you do something unusal, way against the odds, and it works, you have to explain WHY you did it.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-16 HCP, 5+@S, unbal |pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't matter on this layout -- but i'm still wondering|pg||
nt|loganrun: Fine line between - genius and goat|pg||
nt|yr: S will open the forcing @c here|pg||
nt|yr: how many @hs will W bid facing a passed pd|pg||
nt|yr: 1 shd usually be enough , but u never know:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: short break  |pg||
nt|yr: players have the tendency to try to preempt the strong clubbers a bit more than any1 else|pg||
nt|yr: & good strong clubbers relish this , & the Fat ,Juicy  four figure penalties that often  result:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe it is W who opened 1D|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: can make 8 spades on round suit squeeze i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just 2 boards left in our room  the other room still has to play EIGHT  [8]|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphA2: Yes well spotted|pg||
nt|djneill:  brd 21 was a similar auction to 3@h, and 22 both tables got to the doomed @s game|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: sexier than the clkub ruiff for 14|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Mike counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: He will guess club ruff for 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will do it -- but don't let your children see the use of 4N with unstopped @D suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to INSERT PASS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on the intricate auction that led to 6@C+1 here -- the other room played ... 3@D!!!|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1H - on the way to 6 at least|pg||
nt|djneill:  North throws in a little @d action to attract a raise or something|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4N?  avert eyes, o ye of faint gizzard|pg||
nt|yr: here we go,,,3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: I woudl bid 1nt. to show some poiints|pg||
nt|yr: fair enough|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: Whibley doesn't know that his void is working|pg||
nt|yr: that lead gives declarer a double @h chek,,,a small @h wud be double dummy though|pg||
nt|yr: interesting hand to plan the play|pg||
nt|yr: we can see the other table failed badly in 3nt,,down 4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: E could easily have openeing bid with no D control|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has super max for bidding to date|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lml: I understand that South didn't want to bid 1NT without a stopper but now she has a problem|pg||
nt|super nova: Then North can Double 2s to say they have 3 potential places to play.|pg||
nt|yr: well , this 3@h bid actually gives declarer a reason to play  for a 4-1 @d division & double finnese there|pg||
pc|dA|nt|loganrun: Justin believes that Michael will not open the same 1H hand as he did!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 1@S is usually unbal -- but this is 3rd seat |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Howard still blasts knowing they're off  2 keycards|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphA2: If east has no diamond contro how bad will 5@S be|pg||
nt|super nova: South already knows about the 5 hearts .|pg||
nt|super nova: So they can bid 3d.|pg||
nt|frankaus: downgrade to 12-14 1NT by N mayhave stolen the pot|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Claiming|pg||
nt|yr: now if he crosses to hand & leads the @d 10,,,|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphA2: ke says Barry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oh do the replies to 4N inform about diamond control?|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Well done Mike says Barry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i dont know their system|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: 2 key cards so must have @D control problem arises if one key card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, exactly|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: It is a little different game when light openings are systemic|pg||
nt|yr: covered ,,,& then repeats the finnese against the 9 he can make the hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: the 4 card major struck in open room|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|super nova: But after the pass by south over 1s, it is not as clear for north to X|pg||
nt|lml: they can defeat this though and go plus so not so bad|pg||
nt|lml: they weren't making 3NT|pg||
nt|yr: all wishful thinking as declarer goes for a normal 3-2 @d division|pg||
nt|yr: which is a reasonable line of play|pg||
nt|yr: now its all about undertricks,,,the hand cannot be made|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: not sure why it would make a difference|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I fixed the bidding have a look at top|pg||
nt|djneill:  aggressive lead but a @d results in the same thing|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|lml: good point Frank|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|loganrun: As you said - Al - all about 'percentages'|pg||
pc|s2|nt|super nova: The magic number 47 has turned up again|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: this won't have same happy ending as 1@CX on  10|pg||
pc|s5|nt|super nova: First stanze 47-0|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|super nova: 2nd 47-13|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: assuming the other room is in 3N -- does it make??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry partner -- should have bid the grand :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: only worth 12-14 by my evaluation|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: 1@H-D-4@H which is really too much opposite a four card suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: just 2 more boards for our table in this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i missed a trick - thought there was going to be a trump left in dummy |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: We have another game from this tournament in 3 days time. Hope you can join us|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: and such a boring one to start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose, 1 round forcing 1@C|pg||
nt|loganrun: Bad spade break stopped the grand and the 3-1 trump break - things are tough eh|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: 2c|pg||
nt|super nova: D or Majors|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Whibley started with 2@C rather than Prescott's DBL|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: South says 1NT is clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. W is a LOT closer to bidding 4H over an invitation than E is to bidding 4. for several reasons, in fact...for example, if they do bid 4S how will you feel?|pg||
nt|djneill:  seemed like a good shot, very unlikely to set that 4@s otherwise on this auction|pg||
nt|super nova: I would X = some values with south.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Neill surges further ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hehe  the psychic transfer|pg||
nt|lml: I guess it depends what you play double as.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: North maybe throwing smoke in the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  Suction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here ius something u dont see every day. a 20/20 hand with no voids and eaxh side can make gam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry only one void|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Lavings in deep thought|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tactical bidding situation|pg||
nt|lml: I think pass is the normal call.|pg||
nt|super nova: As 2c doesnt have an Anchor suit I usually play it as 'some values' |pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|vugrapha2: South thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it may stop EW from competing -- but what about partner?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: NS are not a regular partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems like 3@S overstates the non existent defense|pg||
nt|super nova: The same as over multi '2d' opening.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
nt|yr: hi Mike|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: but i think it is called something else in New Zealand and Australia|pg||
nt|loganrun: At this vul - perhaps 'Suck'tion|pg||
nt|lml: I like Kalmin's auction|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=constructive   7-10 HCP, 3+@S|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Three obvious losers but some work to be done here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H splinter?   is that really the agreement or just Nabil's intent??|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphA2: So we can see the OR went -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still NS have a sac but 5@S home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear what N is up to, without knowing their understandings. might be trying to buy it in hearts as cheaply as possible by pretending to sound slammish|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|djneill:  West, a passed hand, has a great hand for @h - a 4@h here seems reasonable - as East might have 16-17 so a 3@h is courtesy|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugrapha2: Hung grinnign whne he puts down dummy|pg||
nt|djneill:  oof|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hi|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|lml: the lure of the vul game is too much|pg||
nt|super nova: This wont play too badly.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S presumably constructive, as otyherwise E just has an inbvite|pg||
pc|c9|nt|super nova: 2d diamonds and a spade off the top.|pg||
nt|yr: the last hand was made actually & so the biggest swing o the match so far, |pg||
pc|c7|nt|super nova: KH on side but the and singelton KC,|pg||

nt|super nova: The 9 of spades is a monster card.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: suddenly Nick is too scared to type to the room     in Zone 7  Suction is known as TWERB|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just as an aside, at this point in the Italty-Turkey match, Fantoni-Nunes have only one minus score as NS|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: essentially  a suit bid shows  either  a) the next suit up   or   b) the other 2 suits|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: declare cant really draw trump and get hearts going with the bad break|pg||
pc|dT|nt|super nova: It is going to promote the 8.|pg||
nt|lml: not to mention the diamond ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and a questionable invite at that, with bad trumps and a gaggle of queens|pg||
nt|loganrun: North had both!! - just in case partner forgot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the score is about 50-20. Much tighter here. |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: sort of cant see selling to 4S, but maybe 3S was trying to fetch a D noise from S, so when that didnt happen N thought the save might be too expensive or that iin one way or ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another 5H did not have enough upside/downside ratio|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: Noble would take down 1 in a second if they gave him the option|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i mean a questionable co nstructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: OOps|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: far:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is a very thin game for EW, but it does not look as though it can be defeated - unless East plays clubs in a peculiar fashion  |pg||
