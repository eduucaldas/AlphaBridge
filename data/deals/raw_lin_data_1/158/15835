pc|dJ|pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|tomi2: they can bid 1@D (many meanings) and later rebid 3@D to show invitational values with a weaker suit|pg||
nt|tlc: what would 2@d have been?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D is GF natural in polish club|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is a match from round 3. Format is IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mamos: no sooner had we stopped than we started again|pg||
nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Amos, Povl Sommer and Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so we´ve got the 1st and 2nd pairs|pg||
nt|xenya: They were 1 and 2 after Round 3|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham, Mike Amos and Erik Fryklund|pg||

nt|peacokk: A squeeze |pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|peacokk: Probably not the best line to play anyhow|pg||
nt|peacokk: in the long run|pg||
nt|tez: zorlu assael have 9 card @h but very bad split|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: S hand, despite the 14 count, is too slow. Passing 3d is very reasonable |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Roland. 4@d must be in no danger, so 3@s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sommer: this isnt best contract|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: defence looks favoutite here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: flat hands are often disappointing|pg||
nt|sommer: if W takes the normal way in @C's, NS must hurry to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: something lower you think Povi?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Garner/Weinstein will let it through|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is ok;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is also a winner but difficult to spot|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: just a question of how many - not enormously important at this form of scoring|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Doesn't Martens change the system frequently?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|tomi2: its interesting, since Jassem is known as writer of the "Polish Club" books and Martens published books with his own system (changing system depend. on vul. is his idea"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welland can't believe what's going on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, playing with Zia everything is possible|pg||
nt|tlc: The fans are rarely disappointed, to be sure|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: he is just working out if it can ever be necessary to lead a club back here i would think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't beat it by force but it sure is a great defence|pg||

nt|suketbombi: that was a quick job|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good evening all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: Well, 14 balanced with @SQx. I understand pass|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Welland could have started with a 2S (as a passed hand) to encourage Zia to bid more |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos: 4@S|pg||
nt|ndemirev: HIs hand was great in context |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is a match from round 6 and the last today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: strong club, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  any 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=relay (I think), may be 20+|pg||
nt|peacokk: I guess they will end up in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: and a @c lead against 3nt hadn´t defeated if Welland had played  @cQ from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham and Raju Tolani|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: i think S should have read the @H position on the previous hand|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and not 5@d either|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||

nt|mamos: standings after first two rounds of this strong tournament at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S would be second negative so 2@C shows some values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hence 3NT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2727.html  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 1@s might not be to everyone's taste, but it has worked well|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|xenya: they found a nice spot|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sommer: yes, this will be easy - guess, it will be bid all over|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mamos: not a hand of great interest  -- Butler style scoring I think  effectively imp Pairs    scored on 80-0 match basis|pg||
nt|mamos: ten boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: total imps across the field, two results scratched, with a cap at 40 imp  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pairs are given 40 imps so no negative scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't lose more than the 40 IMPs you have when you start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big scores in the last round:  80-0  77-3  and  71-7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Screens are not in use|pg||

nt|tlc: very nice auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room Helgemo had to improvise, perhaps? 3@H response to 1nt often played as both minors with a singleton|pg||
nt|tomi2: upgrading 14 is very popular in poland, some open much worse hands now 1NT because they have seen the pros doing this|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he decided that was ok as he could always correct clubs to diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: sorry Helness was the one bidding 3@H|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: we have the top clash in round 2, Zia-Welland vs Bocchi-Madala|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer thinks zia has the @HAK, might he end up playing a sort of show-up squeeze?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: in the first round at this table: Zia-Welland against Nyström-Bertheau --- 1st against 2nd in the tournament so far|pg||
nt|athene: and try to drop @CKQ doubleton in west's hand at the end|pg||
nt|athene: let's say you take a club finesse and then run all your tricks - you end up with just two small clubs|pg||
nt|athene: facing @CAJ|pg||
nt|athene: so you lead low and zia plays low|pg||
nt|athene: you think he has the @HA so he can't have the @CQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and as Roland said -- 8.20 am New York, 13.20 CET ... Bocchi-Madala against Zia-Welland|pg||

pc|d8|pc|h3|pc|c5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: welland might help it along by leading another little heart after he wins the @CK|pg||
nt|tomi2: then zia also discards the @SQ he will be known to have @HAKJ @SQ and Martens will not play him for the club queen, because he is passed|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h6|pc|c7|nt|athene: yes, true|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|dT|pc|hJ|pc|s7|nt|athene: declarer puts maximum pressure on the defence by running as many diamonds as he can before revealing anything about his hand|pg||

nt|sommer: was this good?|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like an easy one, yes|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there is a handling problem with both majors breaking badly|pg||

nt|tlc: weissberger convention in the USA, showing inv 55 majors|pg||
nt|tlc: probably called something else on the other side of the pond|pg||
nt|athene: tricky lead decision for welland, knowing that declarer must have lots of minor-suit cards|pg||

nt|athene: is zia wondering whether to duck this? he might be thinking about leaving declarer in dummy in case welland has something like @HKx|pg||
nt|athene: but it can't be right|pg||
nt|thorvald: where should the 5 trick come from  then |pg||
nt|athene: if martens needed he could always overtake with his king and just cash his diamond and take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: yes, in that case the defence haven't got 5 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: or martens could simply lead a little heart to his queen|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps welland was wrong to lead such a big club spot|pg||
nt|athene: of course the ten is an important card|pg||
nt|tlc: martens is considering whether to overtake the club and hope the J@D falls..certainly a reasonable play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could be right to overtake if diamonds are 1-1, the he has 9 winners|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: There will be a correction -- a mistake in the scoring in the last round -- made by Welland -- |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: the TD has just been at the table -- asked to come there by Welland --|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting position|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and still Martens is thinking and stretching and ....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zia misread the 6 but Martens may save him|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: now Martens picks his cards up again -- and then down again -- this might take some longer :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did they defend like this is what's bothering him|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common in this situation to assume (wrongly) that the defence know what they are doing|pg||
nt|athene: because people feel so bad if they play for the defenders to have gone wrong and get talked out of a legitimately makeable contract|pg||

nt|athene: even now it might be tricky - let's say declarer cashes the major-suit winners and then runs the @D10|pg||
nt|athene: west wins and switches to the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: do you rise with the queen, playing east for the @C10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Zia is really taking some time here -- usually I have seen he plays very fast|pg||
nt|tlc: or just duck and play for the diamond honors to be split..in which case your 9th trick will materialize in whichever minor zia deems to present it to them|pg||
