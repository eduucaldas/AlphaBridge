mc|12|nt|suketbombi: yes right paul infact on any Minor opening from precision 2@C to 3@D preamt it is better that way|pg||

nt|ian111:  if he thought the D were 3-3 he could have relied on the long D for his 10th trick|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct:  big double fit here for NS but only 10 tricks in 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the save in 5@c is likely which might push NS to 5@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|viren169: Asimple 4@H here... tough to reach?!?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: and he played it very fast ...|pg||
nt|ian111:  board 17 flat - but I preferred Spear's line|pg||
nt|mrdct:  gill might splinter in @h if available|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  a C at trick 2|pg||
nt|mrdct:  or introduce a clever psyche with a view to retreating to @c later|pg||
nt|mango joe: good result for Australia in closed room|pg||
mb|2N|nt|garnetts: likely collect 2@H and then South will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|mango joe:  West cud hv made a negative X one wud hv thought|pg||
nt|mrdct:  as south, i like to keep 2@H as a natural bid in this auction|pg||
nt|mrdct:  north might suspect west has psyched now!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  yes - X seems normal|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4@H is a make|pg||
mb|3C|nt|viren169: 3@D now may get them there...|pg||
nt|figo: that he does almost always|pg||
nt|ian111:  4H very close|pg||
nt|mrdct:  actually - undo all of those comments - i believe EW play transfer over their 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mrdct:  1@h will just be showing 4+ @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  whilst NS can be held to 10 tricks, that depends of a defence of two black aces at tricks 1 & 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@H is 4 +@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: or 4@H as you say!|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D for us mere mortals!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@d MIGHT DO IT AND IT WILL GO OFF |pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: not great but @Hs 2-2 and @C finesse on|pg||
nt|ian111:  e/w recovered to bif 4H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mango joe: easy to miss slam here which needs either @Cs to come in or @S 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  bid |pg||
nt|ian111:  N/S take the red save - might go -2|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: sorry caps lock  try A@C and three rounds of @D s|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure even I could go down!|pg||
nt|mango joe: a good vul sacrifice if he gets @S right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  this looks to be one or two down - so a lost opportunity for australia|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west has perhaps already shown his hand with his 1@S bid and ought to have left the 5-level decision to compete to east|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ian111:  as so often - no one able to double|pg||
nt|mango joe: so Australia draws level|pg||
pc|d4|nt|viren169: 5 @H + 3@S + 2 ruffs = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should find this defence |pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice @D3|pg||
nt|mango joe: nice bidding sequence in other room after weak NT opening by West|pg||

nt|vicky888:  Hello all, hi mahesh :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Vicky|pg||
nt|mango joe: a 2@C opening in precision often has a  card major as it did in this case at the other table|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4 card major|pg||
nt|mrdct:  4@h for EW looks good here|pg||
nt|mango joe: he had a chance to test the @S and then perhaps guess if E had Kx or W had 10x @H|pg||

nt|vicky888:  Amazing start for Hemant Jalan|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: easy 3NT here for N/S|pg||

pc|hK|nt|viren169: We are in the wrong place!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: o|pg||
nt|vicky888:  light 3rd seat opening will need to take out to 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: still 11 boards to go|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: and I also will act as W now - non vulnerable|pg||
nt|mango joe: wonder what 2@S is, its certainly not weak but 9 tricks seems to be the limit here with 2 trump losers|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  it is interesting, as it has to play three tricks better|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a nice touch--wish they would do that here too  --well done|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|paulg:  Sandy Duncan is one of the most conservative bidders that I know ... a very solid and sound player|pg||
nt|mrdct:  stiff @cA is a little bit hard to evaluate - but west has nothing more to say than 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  @s lead best for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@sx pass interesting other room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct:  the double of 4@c might have meant "don't lead a @c"|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mango joe: another good board for Poddar|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|viren169: looks like a strong 1@C auction to 4@H here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure what 2@S was meant to achieve--3@H looked better--stronger than a direct 4@H |pg||
nt|viren169: just showing 4@S on the way - I guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: 11 tricks--next |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: let @cK win|pg||

nt|suketbombi: @S lead and @H shift in good time|pg||
nt|mango joe: weak NT very popular in the UK|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I would have bid 4@H as East|pg||

nt|suketbombi: Anal has a Gold in last CWG if I am not mistakev?|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: no|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg:  good switch!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|garnetts: after 3@H North might try 3NT  for the minors or in view the double implies minors as he might have acted before with spades |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|paulg:  less good switch|pg||
pc|h4|nt|suketbombi: no more @S discard anal:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Duncan still needs to return a diamond otherwise it will disappear|pg||
nt|mrdct:  if @h are 3-3 he only needs 1 @d trick buy if @H are 4-2 he needs 2 @d tricks - but he doesn't know how many @d tricks he needs until after he's exhausted his entries to dummy|pg||

mb|2N|nt|paulg:  Irving Gordon won the World Senior Pairs with a 90-year-old Boris Shapiro|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm not sure what west's dbl means. perhaps a side 4-card suit where bidding 3@d would show 5-5|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Same for u and kibs Paul|pg||
nt|mango joe: This hasnt been an exciting set so has favoured the teams leading in their matches|pg||
nt|mrdct:  it's been a long month of bridge for paul gosney who played in the Rosenblum, then the World Youth Championships, then the Commonwealth Nations and now the HCL - I'm sure he's feeling a little bit homesick by now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: NS have now passed the best contract 3nt|pg||
nt|mango joe: dont much care for Norths opening as he doesnt have a rebid over 2@Cs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: They have also pinpointed the defence too --no heart control |pg||
nt|viren169: North was hoping they went on!|pg||
nt|garnetts: North should lead the A@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: this will clear things up for him|pg||
nt|garnetts: If he doesn't like that the A@H is a standout |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: north asking east....thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: Not an easy lead...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|mango joe: so another good board for the Aussies and 6 imps|pg||
nt|mango joe: Hemant need something good to happen soon|pg||

nt|mango joe: no. needed to duck @S|pg||
nt|mango joe: 5@S shows Q@H i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
nt|mango joe: can he find out about Q@S?|pg||
nt|mango joe: he cant bid 7 with any surety|pg||
nt|mango joe: he knows abut K@D A@C and Q to four @hs|pg||
nt|mango joe: and he knows that N will have a bit more for his opening |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: hoping that partner has @sq also|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes but it will be on a hope rather than certainty|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: I can understand the @s lead from E|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|mango joe: or QJ@D to 4|pg||
nt|mango joe: KQJ i mean|pg||

pc|hA|nt|garnetts: I am afraid it is an easy lead--look at your hand and lsiten to the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still a lot to do|pg||

mb|2C|nt|paulg:  perhaps it went fast at the end and he did not pitch all his diamonds|pg||

nt|ian111:  both sides can make 10 tricks in a minor|pg||
nt|ian111:  which final ?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Hemant or Scotland?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Commonwealth Games Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzat:  Hemant Jalan leads Alpha by 75-0:   Arun Jain leads Magic Eyes( thailand) by 22:   Australia leads Formidables 51-19|pg||
nt|ian111:  Hemant |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: This is a board, wher you have to choose betwenn 5 ot 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  it was close with about 8 boards to play, but ended up over 40 to Hemant|pg||
nt|mango joe: 2@H shows less than 4 points normally, its the weakest response|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  if North would bypass a 4-card diamond suit to bid 1NT, as many would, then pass is an option that would not work out well|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  but Duncan-Gordon are pretty old-school and so retreating to clubs looks sensible|pg||

nt|mango joe: a kib points out that 6@D makes but I think its very unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mango joe: Norths hand has improved though as South has shown short @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: 40 imps needed in 3 boards, havent seen that before|pg||
mb|5D|nt|paulg:  a less exciting hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: unless defence slip up looks like -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: @ds 4-1 so 6@D not on|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|paulg:  when holding long trumps it is often best to lead your own long suit, rather than a singleton, to try and force declarer|pg||

nt|mrdct:  this will be 1 or 2 down i think|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the @h pips work well for declarer though - so he should make at least 6 tricks now and where there is a 6th there si often a 7th|pg||

mb|p|nt|mango joe: Mahesh?|pg||
nt|ian111:  i thought so too|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes  12 x 3 |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: this set started with 15 as 1st|pg||
nt|mango joe: but this is 13th board|pg||
nt|ian111:  so why are we playing bd 25?|pg||
nt|mango joe: ah ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 15-  26|pg||
nt|mango joe: ok thanks|pg||
nt|ian111:  ah yes - 13/14 removed|pg||
nt|ian111:  looks like 4S -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  31 imps in 2 boards looks unlikely|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ian111:  needs a H guess and C finesse|pg||
nt|ian111:  could try 3NT and hope to avoid a H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s on E or do you show a 2-suiter? |pg||
nt|paulg:  a slam swing on board 25 has given Hemant Jalan some breathing room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i show two-suiters these days|pg||
nt|mrdct:  pretty much need two double game swings|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulg:  in my system, it would be 3@c to show non-strong spades and clubs|pg||
nt|mango joe: puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Duncan's bid depends on their methods after a reverse ... some play 2NT as artificial (with weak hands)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now E? do you regret only 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: yet to get a push board|pg||
nt|ian111:  not easy to bid the thin but good 5C|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|mrdct:  it would take a horrible defence to let NS make 5@d here - not that they are at all likley to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: arun jain 117- magic eyes 78|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|paulg:  3NT probably suggests a weak club stop|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Gordon has nowhere to go .. he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: usually the weaker hand bids the major he doesnt have |pg||
nt|ian111:  4S by E might make on CJ lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  are the results on the web anywhere?|pg||
nt|mango joe: 9 top tricks now|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzat: see hcl website|pg||
nt|mrdct:  both 5@c and 3NT depend on the @s hook|pg||
