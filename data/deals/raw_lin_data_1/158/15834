pc|hK|nt|athene: actually it was very interesting because you might argue as follows:- if south had 8x it's better to play low because then declarer has a total guess whether to play for 8x or 10x ...|pg||
nt|athene: - both equally likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: at least when lady gives  8 we have lot of things to talk here  its s  exited|pg||
nt|athene: so on that basis you might think that when the 8 falls you SHOULD play for 108|pg||

nt|vugraphzsh: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to the Tivoli Congress Center for the inaugural Copenhagen Bridge Invitational. 16 world class pairs, 15 rounds of 10 boards over three days. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is a match from round 3. Format is IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Søren Fritzbøger|pg||
nt|mamos: no sooner had we stopped than we started again|pg||
nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Amos, Povl Sommer and Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The score is 40-40 IMPs when they start a match and you can't lose more than the 40 you already have|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so we´ve got the 1st and 2nd pairs|pg||
nt|xenya: They were 1 and 2 after Round 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Commentators Mike Graham, Mike Amos and Erik Fryklund|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In theory, a match can finish 80-0, but that is theory|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peacokk: Hey|pg||
nt|xenya: Still are?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS?|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Tez|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: Zia is 1 with 212 and Zorlu is 2. with 192|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk4: Auken-von Arnim  vs   Bertheau-Nyström|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe 3@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: We will get names up soon|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 16 +16 to start with|pg||

nt|mamos: hi mike|pg||
nt|peacokk: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html  for standings after round 2|pg||
nt|mamos: my brain needs start up time  but cant see 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|peacokk: A squeeze |pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peacokk: Probably not the best line to play anyhow|pg||
nt|peacokk: in the long run|pg||
nt|tez: zorlu assael have 9 card @h but very bad split|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ndemirev: S hand, despite the 14 count, is too slow. Passing 3d is very reasonable |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree Roland. 4@d must be in no danger, so 3@s|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sommer: this isnt best contract|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: defence looks favoutite here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: flat hands are often disappointing|pg||
nt|sommer: if W takes the normal way in @C's, NS must hurry to take 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: something lower you think Povi?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Garner/Weinstein will let it through|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is ok;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D is also a winner but difficult to spot|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: just a question of how many - not enormously important at this form of scoring|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sommer: got the chance there!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: not easy for S to shift from KJ6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, maybe 5@D can go down on a club lead, but East would never find that|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt and 5@d was makeble..5@c beats only @c lead (may be)|pg||
mc|11|pg||

nt|roswolf: i think the rule to be followed is play the a priori odds unless you have very clear evidnce to the contrary|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: people raise to 3 on lighter hands these days, it seems to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difference of style; Zia overcalled 1@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: once while i was cogitating on a similar play the opp on my right dropped the vital card face up on the table!|pg||
nt|athene: i like 1@D for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The overcall actually helped E-W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i suppose you would rather the @D7 were the 8 or 9, but such is life|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then West had no bid and they were able to stop in 2@S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|thorvald: I play 2@S as 3-card or minimum, and then jump on 13-15 hands with 4-card support|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|thorvald: just need better declarer play :-)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: well to me you can make 9 tricks but it is not trivial|pg||
nt|athene: heart finesse to discard a club loser and you can ruff enough things|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Bocchi has lost interest in this board - and has started reading in their systembook -- a lot of pages :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure on a diamond lead and club switch|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a natural line i think bill|pg||
nt|thorvald: Double dummy its easy ruffing red suits, and endplaying north|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: or you can just lead clubs towards dummy and basically get a trick with the jack|pg||
nt|athene: you don't mind losing two clubs|pg||
nt|athene: the hand (as so often with a 4-4 fit) isn't about having too many losers, but too few winners|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is a first thing for everything. Twice as many spectators in this room although Zia is playing next door. Must be the commentators :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: first time*|pg||
pc|dK|pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: yes my constant problem -too few winners!:(|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|athene: the defence had a fairly common dilemma - if they force, declarer just crossruffs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|c6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: if they don't force he can set up his club trick|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Next round (last today): Jassem-Martens vs Zia-Welland at this table|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h9|pc|s8|pc|cK|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: often in these tricks contracts your aim as declarer is to keep both lines of play available|pg||
pg||

nt|tez: 5@d i mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but not even a try? not like Zia!|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Well, 14 balanced with @SQx. I understand pass|pg||
nt|ndemirev: Welland could have started with a 2S (as a passed hand) to encourage Zia to bid more |pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@S|pg||
nt|ndemirev: HIs hand was great in context |pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: strong club, 1@d negative|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H  any 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=relay (I think), may be 20+|pg||
nt|peacokk: I guess they will end up in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and a @c lead against 3nt hadn´t defeated if Welland had played  @cQ from dummy|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: i think S should have read the @H position on the previous hand|pg||
nt|tez: need agrement here..whats dbl?t/o to @d or good @c's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and not 5@d either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: probably long suit, wekaish hand, and reasonable conclusion  |pg||
nt|mamos: standings after first two rounds of this strong tournament at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S would be second negative so 2@C shows some values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: hence 3NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|mamos: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|xenya: they found a nice spot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: yes, this will be easy - guess, it will be bid all over|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: not a hand of great interest  -- Butler style scoring I think  effectively imp Pairs    scored on 80-0 match basis|pg||
nt|mamos: ten boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: total imps across the field, two results scratched, with a cap at 40 imp  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pairs are given 40 imps so no negative scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't lose more than the 40 IMPs you have when you start|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Screens are not in use|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 75 minutes to complete 10 boards|pg||

nt|athene: the defence have to commit to leading trumps or not and they can't counter both plans|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo-Helness vs Madala-Bocchi at the other|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|athene: strong club|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be an easy slam to bid|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: but make?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Zia was inspired|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|thorvald: needinig to make the hearts right here, and a finess, not a good contract at the other table|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that is a very good question roland|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't know what made Zia do the right thing in hearts|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: EW did not bid|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@H was natural and forcing to game, but only 4+ hearts, which isn't usual for strong club auctions |pg||
mb|4D!|nt|athene: after that it all looks natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: a lot of tapping here -- even Bocchi is tapping on his "Pass" bids :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2726.html  for standings after round 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would get hearts wrong for sure|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5C!|nt|Walddk2: That's why I am not plaaying|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D!|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: this is a pretty bad slam isn't it? you have the @DK out there as well as the trump suit issue|pg||
nt|thorvald: Perhaps Zia was wondering why West lead a spade, might be because other suits was worse to lead from|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now will sabine be inspired|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a terrible slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: any guess on lead from Bocchi|pg||
nt|thorvald: she will get a @c lead and no clues at all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a little better with North as declarer|pg||
nt|thorvald: or 7 of @s|pg||
nt|athene: i really don't see any reason why you should get this right|pg||
nt|roswolf: well anti par i agree but i dont see how you can sensiblby keep out of it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: He has four 7's to choose from, 3 of the 4 OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This will take some time|pg||
nt|athene: if east had shown minors, that would definitely have been enough to tip the balance|pg||
nt|athene: for getting the trumps right|pg||
nt|athene: but it might also have stopped them bidding it (@DK offside more often)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|athene: but after 1@C and the positive, Bocchi didn't see any point bidding at game all|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|thorvald: A @d back migh help declare guessing the hearts as she needs to take the finess - i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: will exit a club after a while I think|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|athene: you can run the @H8 if you choose to do that|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: and take the trump finesse and stay in dummy for a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|athene: but there is also the question of perhaps wanting to ruff a diamond|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: 3000 eyes on Sabine|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: if you play for 3-1 trumps that means you have a problem with a potential overruff from west|pg||
nt|thorvald: so now the diamond finess, but what then ?|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry you have a pitch on the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I will bet on @h Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: but then -- I am at the table |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c6|mc|11|nt|athene: yes @HQ just looks totally normal|pg||
pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@H   seems normal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Ns game here too - just a question of which one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT or 4@h|pg||
nt|sommer: at least one would be quite safe, imo|pg||
nt|xenya: E would have been squeezed on the last trump, yes|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 @H here|pg||
nt|sommer: only for one overtrick:)|pg||
nt|mamos: if 1NT is 12-14  may play ther|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2NT=12-13 hcp|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ndemirev: 4H is a normal destination here |pg||
nt|ndemirev: 6H could make double dummy |pg||
mb|3D|an|trsf|mb|p|nt|mamos: or not :(|pg||
nt|sommer: this may be American Stayman|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ndemirev: 3D  must show 5+H|pg||
nt|ndemirev: now Welland may find another bid |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|peacokk: Well played by Nyström, just a overtrick at stake here|pg||
nt|mamos: East has poor Spades  and knows declarer only has three minor cards|pg||
nt|sommer: S showed 4c@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: It was|pg||
nt|sommer: hi Søren:)..gl and well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzsh: hi povl|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sommer: yes..specs ask me..I am right..it is puppet Stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|mamos: i expect @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ah well|pg||
nt|sommer: quite normal in US to jump to 3@C changing from normal to (Am)puppet Stayman|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|ndemirev: 14-30 i guess |pg||
nt|ndemirev: this lead may tip Zia to actually making it |pg||
pc|s9|nt|mamos: same sort of idea|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what conclusion can Zia draw from this lead?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ndemirev: We'll see :) this is Zia|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|thorvald: So how do we find out what made Zia do it right :-)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Intuition, nothing else|pg||
nt|athene: well the odds are pretty close|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's Zia for you|pg||
nt|roswolf: ask him at donner!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I will ask Zia -- he is at this table in the next round :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: dinner|pg||
nt|athene: it's not that finessing is a hugely anti-percentage shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: so you have to wait for some time|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2726.html  for standings after round 4|pg||
nt|athene: the issue here is whether to overtake - normally you don't mind ruffing with a "useless" trump but showing out on the first round of trumps might help declarer pick up your ...|pg||
nt|athene: partner's Jxxx or something|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: still 35 minutes left of this round|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|thorvald: 4@s looks ok to me, |pg||
nt|athene: so she prefers to play low and hope they didn't need to untangle three club tricks fast|pg||
nt|athene: most of the time 2@C will be a six-card suit anyway so there's less reason for the overtake|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps Sabine is now wondering whether her partner left her on lead to lead through the @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if south had @DKJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zia did not even need the diamond finesse in 6@H. He got a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: club to dummy and a heart to the king and ace|pg||
nt|athene: actually i know how zia might have got that trump guess right|pg||
nt|athene: if you look at the play in that room|pg||
nt|athene: west led a spade|pg||
nt|athene: with @S10xxxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Madala is in the "tank" -- head in hands and almost looks like he has fell a sleep|pg||
nt|athene: maybe hoping his partner had a singleton|pg||
nt|athene: so he could win the @HA and give him a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but|pg||
nt|athene: when he won the @HA he didn't play a second spade|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: and maybe zia thought ok, that is because he knows that east can't overruff dummy|pg||
nt|athene: even if he IS out of spades now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I promise to ask Zia before next round :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: board no 25 is interesting in closed room  zia opened  1cl with noýthing  adn the opp  went down in 7h|pg||
nt|tokay1975: funny|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, back at the ranch. Seems like Madala needs to do something clever in hearts eventually|pg||
nt|athene: yes Zia really beating up Zorlu and Assael|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: spade to the 10, heart to he queen, that helps|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont expect him to make but lets see|pg||
nt|roswolf: daniela feels the heat as well|pg||
nt|tokay1975: wth open cards he make  now but....|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: this is a "slow" board -- and now Bocchi has finished reading in the systembook and has started reading in the Bulletin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She is actually squeezed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tokay1975: now heart to queen dia ace  sp to ace  queen of diamonds and exit last dia south  plays heart to a-10 tenace|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 4sp 3h 3dia totatly makes 10|pg||
nt|tokay1975: totally|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a hard hand to get right by e/w i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Madala says unasked: "We play Walsh" |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: so E might have a longer @d suit|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D=?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D artificial - 16+ without 3 hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: TY|pg||
nt|athene: seems a bit of a strange method - you are making things hard for yourself to bid 2@D there on so many shapes, surely?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would agree but these guys work on their system constantly|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt may show the "walsh" hand|pg||
nt|athene: i would assume 2nt is some sort of lebensohl, asking west to bid 3@C so he can sign off|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: in which case this sequence would show a stronger hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, anything not 3@C shows extras i.e. game-force|pg||
nt|thorvald: He needed a little more to make 3NT a ok contract, like the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: 2nt is explained as weak|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s can cash enough tricks here - |pg||
nt|tokay1975: defence  should cash |pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: all the spot cards making a difference here|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes - this could end up in something doubled - no, South has come to the rescue|pg||

mb|p|nt|sommer: the stiff @DK helps W|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sommer: with @HAK in S, he may even score an overtrick..but I think, he will try to make 8 first:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now he can count 3 spades and 4 clubs and a diamond, when NS dont start ruffing @C|pg||

nt|athene: if west actually bid his spades, south might not lead one :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Anyone that wouldn't lead a spade in this sequence ? |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup the ladies wont be though - i suspect fireworks ahead|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes the bidding made things uneasy for  opp|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: the Ace of clubs was possible i think but falling back on 4th best would have worked|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|thorvald: so 5@c seems to be the spot here|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S will be takeout without spades|pg||
nt|athene: i assume|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsg: 1@s=0-3 @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: simple straightforward sequence|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|tokay1975: norberto can make  this by playing diamonds queen and 9 from dummy|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very lucky|pg||
nt|athene: they could have got 500 from 4@H, i think?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would he have done without the beer card (@D7)?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: when he see singleton club in north  he can play this way|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to double people when you don't have trumps, because you don't know if they have a 5-5 fit with no shape (you get 500) or a 5-5 fit with lots of shape (you get -590)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now you see how important that card is|pg||
nt|roswolf: nah taking the money might have cost some imps - i agree to bid their game|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He'll get it right|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i bet on norberto bocchi|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Just a question of whether he leads the queen or 9, same thing|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would be suprised if he did not|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't know the heart break for sure but 5-5 looks what you go for|pg||
nt|athene: @D8 trying to look like a lady with @D108 doubleton|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 8 of diamonds is great card|pg||
nt|athene: nice card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gives Norberto a losing option|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed if played in tempo but norberto has played this game before|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h7|pc|c6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if she gives  declarer has %50chance  if 8 is singleton or 10is singelton|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tokay1975: if gives small|pg||
pc|h8|pc|cT|nt|thorvald: still the same guess, but some playes forget|pg||
nt|athene: this is an example of knowing the player|pg||
nt|athene: if you assume south would drop the 8 from 8x all the time, then clearly the odds play is the finesse|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i thk this is  more then 50%|pg||
nt|tokay1975: to play 8 in first|pg||
nt|tokay1975: for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: I didnt see Sabines drop here |pg||
nt|athene: gains with 85, 83, 82 and loses only to 108|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: sorry -- |pg||
nt|Walddk2: but he will see the 3 or 5 next|pg||
nt|thorvald: yes, where is the 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree though|pg||
nt|athene: it's not trivial because he might be wondering if hearts could be 6-4 and the @D8 a singleton|pg||
nt|tokay1975: aftre small  dia in first  devlarer has %50chance  is the last  is 8 or 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you decide to play South for 8x, then stick to your plan|pg||
nt|athene: but that just adds to the odds for playing the finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: Norberto is shuffeling his cards -- and now he puts the two on the table |pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 8 doubleton is a priori against the odds and still is|pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and he picks one of them |pg||
nt|vugraphzsg: and then he says -- That means @d 9 to be played -- so I will|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
