nt|sybarra: hello David and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi aLL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: s IS HLFWY BETWEEN MIXED AND LIMIT RAZE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E overcalls as expected, expect N to be bullish|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention card for NS is available under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26/Australia.aspx|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Team Horwitz has 5 youngsters  - and Horwitz|pg||

nt|ahollan1: David -- that was much better comeback than what i was typing|pg||
nt|super nova: 2d = Hearts or the black suits.|pg||
nt|super nova: TWERB= two way exclusive relay bid.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
nt|super nova: Two way because you have either the suit above or the two suits below.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
nt|super nova: Normally I would like to have a 6th. for the bid.. but the hand shoudl be worth one bid.|pg||
nt|super nova: It is part of a convension called TWERB|pg||
nt|super nova: Exclusive because you bid the one suit you dont have which is often the opps suit.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
nt|super nova: Relay because your partner makes a relay to find out what you have typically.|pg||
nt|super nova: Pitt team had a 3 imp carry forward,|pg||
nt|super nova: but they lost the first set 47 - 0. so they were quite behind.|pg||

mb|d|nt|super nova: The second set Pitt team won 47 to 13.. seems that 47 is having a role to play in todays match.?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Prescott-Noble-Bilski in whatever combination play play what's called Modified Polish Club|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Klinger has always struggled with counting points|pg||
nt|tejjyid: bot on loser count, 1@S is clear|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: This is the final of the Sydney National Open Teams (SNOT)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Playing 4 x 16 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really have very little resemblence to Polish Club |pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Al and specs|pg||
nt|loganrun: A slam in hearts or NT as long as you play the diamonds in the appropriate way|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough for North; 3@D not quite enough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but X too risky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he has a 7th @H to make up for the suit quality :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: and for your future viewing plans, full vugraph schedule with all times local to you is found here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for non-americans, adam west played Batman on TV, and Joe south was a country singer (games people play)|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think the operator may fill those in, though Adam West would be great to see|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Bill is West and Paul is South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he also sang the classic "dont it make you wanna go home?"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much response from Neill only 16 highs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphA2: Hi Chris|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Welcome to a wet windy cold rainy sydney day|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Seniors Teams|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: North probably thinking about 6@D - assuming 3@S is a raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|tejjyid: BW - the simple answer to all slam questions|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Hi David - a suuny Melbourne welcomes you|pg||
nt|loganrun: sunny|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oooo   Andy is playing with Nabil     in the PABF it was Andy-Adam|pg||
nt|super nova: Seems like a relatively routine hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Yes this is an irregular partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Prescott had an opening bid option with 5+/5+ @H & @S   so  this 2@H probably [keyword] implies 5/4|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok Ron is clearly a NT-o-phile, last hand 1NT with 5 good hearts, now 1N rebid with 6 hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the @H game missed|pg||
nt|jkotor: strange X from N, why not 3@h?|pg||
nt|exerdar: dbl showing max hand of 2@H, but e-w cant stop i think, after xx|pg||
nt|jkotor: same is 2N and then 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: not sure what 5@h is|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: or 3N or 4N :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: South has a max. with good trumps - there must have been a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and claims|pg||
nt|exerdar: will be one down,  looks like 3 more imps to √ùtaly    |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: EW carding   standard count & attitude   odd/even 1st discard|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: Prescott caught a pretty nice dummy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: ron understandably treating his hearts as a 4.72 card suit on second round, then accordioning the out to 5.6 on next round|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: @S 3-3 is pretty friendly too|pg||
pc|d8|nt|loganrun: Declarer has got himself a bit tangled up here|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Bit is very charitable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Noble won the Qualifying -- that accounts for their 11 imps|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1 i think|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|peachy: the only remaining consideration is to not lose more than two trumps|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|exerdar: nice @DQ by Franchi|pg||
pc|hK|nt|djneill:  8 tricks looks easy but 9?|pg||
nt|djneill:  must rely on his one Ace up his sleeve, the fact opponents think he has 5 hearts, not sure if it can be done|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how the new partnership would treat North's 2nd DBL instead of the chosen 3@D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|djneill:  it is hard for me to think outside the box on defense, if declarer made a "judgement", defense is hard enough|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jkotor: baaaad mistake by EW, sth went wrong on discards|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|d5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|othered1: And pass by south shows @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|othered1: need minor suit cashout to beat this, except that east likely won't consider south's @H holding on this auction. |pg||

mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: that's the last time i'll copy/paste THAT|pg||
nt|super nova: I remember once in the worlds one commentator was saying that the player was caught speeding with a bad suit and a weak hand.. yes -800 in 2h x.|pg||
nt|jkotor: could have been 800-1100|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: oh yeah -- 1@C was 1-Round Force|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: 4s|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tejjyid: an excellent hand to defend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can make a case for X rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand is a breather...|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes, Marshall would you have responded 3NT on this North hand?  It is close|pg||
nt|jkotor: but Buras played E for worse @h, and probably 4|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: notice Nabil's 1@S -- in preparation of showing @H if he gets a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is exactly the kind of hand that defends the case; playale in 3 suits, why not tell partner about it?|pg||
mb|r|nt|ahollan1: this might have been a good time to try an offbeat mini-splinter  [showing 9-12 HCP]   but Whibley is there anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: would you play clubs thru West to create a swing here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally you wouldn't expect to see  the 4@S bidder with an ace|pg||
nt|loganrun: South punting here - could be off 2 controls here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: we are fortunate to have al here to explain all the bids|pg||
nt|peachy: when I am kibitzing, I appreciate that a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice "all" is spelled with small letters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Prescott gave any thought to 3N instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: not for .05 second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: or it wasnt apparent|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H being NF, he understandably shose the trump contract|pg||
nt|peachy: chose*|pg||
nt|peachy: the tenaces would have been nice though, to have lead come into|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Or if you have an ipad http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil asking iff Andy has something good for him and Andy says INDEED|pg||

nt|exerdar: now 2sp or 3cl|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: seems Bilski needs one of the black Kings onside|pg||

mb|p|nt|super nova: I am trying to pump down declarer so that my trumps become longer than theirs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Notice Nabil falsecards on every trick - so predictable|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-16 HCP, 5+@H, unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout at 2-level   i assume that also applies at 3-level|pg||

mb|2C|nt|tejjyid: nothing can tell u how much i hate opening 1@d n rthe West ards|pg||
nt|lml: do you like 3NT?|pg||

nt|super nova: I would start with X to see which way things are going.|pg||
nt|lml: but Evans may not pass |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a very makeable but thin 4@S NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: oh 5d is an excellent bid on this hand.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|peachy: Apparent takeout since it was pulled|pg||
nt|djneill:  :-)  Paul Lavings (West) may play slower now for you Judy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could miss a laydown 6C even facing PH, or play doomed 3N with 5C spread|pg||

nt|djneill:  astuted of the caped crusader|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Paul stuffed up - thank goodness|pg||

nt|marlowepi: cannot approve 1NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugrapha2: not clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even so -- with 4333 converting to penalty had to be an option|pg||
nt|super nova: oh.. but that was b/c it now gave East another chance.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: lots of work for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: This hand looks tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead|pg||
nt|peachy: but he might manage to make it, provided he does not start on clubs early on|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is that you cant make a minor slam which is certainly a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|lml: so this might work out well for east-west|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S has a 1C opener|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Hung still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming upside-down count/attitude for NS --- @D continuation is expected  -- but no need to rush without thinking|pg||
nt|exerdar: Franchi should play a very careful|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Noble was to bidding 4@H instead of 3@H   that would have been interesting |pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||

nt|super nova: yes as the distribution lies,, it doesnt work :-D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: when failing to follow suit|pg||

nt|djneill:  West may want to bid here, for surely East is never leading a @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|vugraphA2: What would you bid here as south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opener is weak [another non Polish Club treatment] that allows 5@H/@S -- but apparently not 5422|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok transfer overcall, allows West to shape out with interesting hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||

nt|yr: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@H from west wide range opposite a limited 1@H opener|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: A club ruff is a trick the defence would get anyway likely declarer will lose 1-1-1-1 for one down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Any other Vul I would have bid 4@S|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: David -- you get encouraged at other vulnerability when partner passes twice??|pg||

mb|p|nt|saverio: 2 at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Here west is likely to open and north's action, if any, will likely determine the fate of the hand.  Here it may be tough to get to game.|pg||
nt|saverio: i'd bid 1N with N hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|saverio: wdnt pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: The more aggressive south is in general in these positions, the less likely to get to game|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: north is going to take the slow route, exploring other strains.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|othered1: and 2@S doesn't add anything to what north knows.|pg||
nt|saverio: now S should raise due to the vulnerability|pg||
nt|othered1: Some ask if 2@D would have been better by south at third turn.  Perhaps that would confirm more than a minumum reopening in their methods.|pg||

nt|lml: who thinks east-west will get to 3NT?|pg||
nt|yr: NS will probably end up in a @s game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: does everybody like 1NT with 7 solid.  It really understates the playing strength of the hand|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphA2: 3NT NS looks the go here especially after spades block|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: confession time -- I did NOT think about south opening 1N|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: profiles updates|pg||
nt|lml: will South save her?|pg||
nt|yr: a typical icelandic relay auction:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: THe dead @D K is unattractive, but you have to ignore that really|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: uh uh should have passed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: they dont bloxk when E leads king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well if South is balanced, i suppose we can say East is single-suited|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if spades bad 4@S will be no picnic|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thinking short, rather than bad. Stil, 3NT is OK here|pg||
nt|lml: I asked if people thought E-W would get to 3NT at the beginning of the hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: at the bridge table lool|pg||
nt|lml: and looks liek they have|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: lucky the clubs work |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Good luck with that one|pg||
nt|yr: well the 4-4 @s fit  was lost completely there|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: which is the correct spade to lead if u are going to kead one on thius acution|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: South has bid 1@S I would lead the jack regardless|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: I certainly wouldnt lead the 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when S has bid the suit, king seems right to me|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|vugrapha1: what Well thought out Linda|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Lets agree the 5 is wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if pd has Ax, declarer is going to get it wrong anyway and you will be better off. but main chance is someone havinbg stiuff queen|pg||
nt|yr: this contract will depend on how declarer plays @ds|pg||
nt|yr: given that muller dosnt play @cs|pg||
nt|exerdar: aconterno suggestion:if duck @c, need to unblock @sQ|pg||

nt|jkotor: or for players mistake if Q@c behind and @c 5-3?|pg||
nt|aconterno: will play@cJ|pg||
nt|jkotor: he can still loose it with @c 5-3 after @c trick 3 if E has 2 honours in @s|pg||
nt|exerdar: 1@c showing polish club  or others?|pg||
nt|jkotor: polish style|pg||

nt|vugraphzuu: franch√Ω  ask√Ωng  1cl  kotorowicz |pg||

nt|marlowepi: not sure about winning layout for ten or jack winning layouts|pg||

nt|peachy: EW succeeded in getting a plus from this hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: i can't find a line here that doesn't rely upon peeking|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|lml: east-west what I think was a bit of an undeserved 16 imps on the Board 4.  they played in a wimpy 5@D when 6@C goes dowm on a defensive crossruff|pg||

nt|lml: which is what happened in the OR|pg||
nt|frankaus: NS did the damage with the lightner - so deserve some credit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's been a long week and they were only 4 man teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|lml: my husband wrote a blog about moral imps.  Have you ever heard of that ID|pg||
nt|lml: idea|pg||
nt|yr: W shoots out 4@s|pg||
nt|aconterno: 2@s EW|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphA2: I kind of like passing with the East hand and then cue bidding to show 2 suiter|pg||

mb|d|nt|marlowepi: you mean showing it on the next deal?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tried to bid 1S but not allowed:)|pg||
nt|lml: the idea is that if you get to a slam that has a 5% chance and it makes you lose moral imps (But gain real ones) :)|pg||
nt|yr: after 4nt i cant see S stopping at the 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Lavings   asks 5@H/@S AND size|pg||
nt|frankaus: this is AUS = morals = a beer after each hand, or a chardonay |pg||
mb|1S|nt|tejjyid: nice lead directing bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3@S more or less invites opponents to bid slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: liquid imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Haughie has an absolute max nt|pg||

nt|jkotor: 1@s is 1RF|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1@d is 0-6 any|pg||
nt|exerdar: could be 1@s all pass|pg||
nt|aconterno: yes, W is a passed hand|pg||
nt|jkotor: but now 1@s is 7-11 when 10-11 not 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now 6@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only if they think you have to be very weak rather than just very offensively oriented. and in any case they wont bid one if they dont fiind a fit they are confident is adequate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if you dont expect to make can bid it, they probably sacrifice|pg||
nt|tejjyid: here NS have given EW too much room|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: pd is balanced and S will be motivated to pass the double on a lot of shapely hands|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: are you ready for the next bid....|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry it is W who isthinking not Krock|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over here both EW players m,ight have bid diamonds on the first round|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: would anybody else overcall 1@S [in lieu of DBL?]|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: Only if Dbl guaranteed both majors|pg||
nt|yr: so far , so good, now they need to make it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=12-13 HCP, 5@S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: also one should have agreements here NS about what is fit showing and what is one suited and/or what is interested in saving against a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: haviong trouble understanding N reluctamce to support hearts. if he had 5 of them he would have pened 1H|pg||
nt|djneill:  Klinger is not unhappy!|pg||
nt|djneill:  talk about 100 honors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @d's 3-3 and Q2@H all nice|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i started playing weak or kamikaze NT 35 years ago -- i'm sure i NEVER discussed East's sequence of the delayed 3@H|pg||
nt|yr: its natural to finnese they @h q right after the preempt & that shd be enough to make 5@h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphA2: But .... Pass= Penalties or two touching suits|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: So 3@H showed majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what strength??|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If Nabil finds a diamond lead this will be BAD|pg||
nt|peachy: landed well with that action|pg||
nt|lml: do you know what East meant 1@s to be?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right. and no matter what E showed, why couldnt it go all pass after the double?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does W always RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll bet PASS not only showed the 2 options -- but was also FORCING|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Because presumably West must act|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that lets NS escape when they have a runout spot and u were making|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Redouble on the basis it is penalties or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if overcalling 1@C has changed now that transfers are used over 1@C-P and 1@C-DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S might have bid 4D for example|pg||
pc|c6|nt|djneill:  must be in 4@h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: safety assures many tricks now|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, pluses and minuses i guess|pg||
pc|s2|nt|frankaus: nat F|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: N has opened a hand with almost 9 losers, and in almost his worst suit. one would think he would be thrilled to support hearts|pg||
nt|djneill:  or in fact, these may be the wrong hands|pg||
nt|jkotor: very good leads by NS other table (Q@s first lead) and well deserved poings|pg||
nt|aconterno: another imps for Poland in this board|pg||

pc|d6|nt|djneill:  seniors are having a Neill moment|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i dont like making the last guess. 1N X 2N (2 placesd to play, 3 level or better) seems to get a duirect message across|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i do t think Ron would openm 1S with that shape|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|djneill:  what if East opened 1@s and South bid 2@h|pg||
nt|lml: it looks like a transfer to 1NT but it wasnt alerted|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphA2: Ouch now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe a transfer advance = 1C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Nabil choice of 3@C rather than PASS might not get the majority of votes   another sequence that doesn't get mentioned in print|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does the elimination work?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how could defense stop that after the @D lead?|pg||

nt|frankaus: the sping nationals in its 9th day  - 60 a day  - for some - |pg||
nt|lml: On Board 5 where Kalmin didn't untangle the play in 2@H the other table made an overtrick and so won 6 more imps|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: sorry abput not alerting but her friend is supposed to bwe doing that|pg||
nt|yr: sad result after they reached an exellent contract|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: the method played by EW for 1N X Pass seems theoretically questionable because it giuves the opps the whole two level when E is 2 suited|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E has a 2 suited runout, the n it is fine, but withg a hand that might produce a game ui think a different call is in order, e.g. 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: On the 4@S going down 2 and you asked what the result at the other table might be 5@H -2 and 9 imps to Noble|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Both sides need to avoid trouble on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Sorry 5@HX -1|pg||
nt|tejjyid: illustrates the theme that bridge is ablout balancing information for partner & info for opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is multi-purpose  and  1-round force |pg||

nt|marlowepi: not a surprising outcome for that bid when LHO has opened 2C. still it might have been the key to the city if LHO was slated to end in 3N and had a spade tenace|pg||

mb|1S|nt|frankaus: 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not keen on 2N with so much playability in spades, even though pd is a PH|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, it's only the huge EW fit that makes it fraught|pg||
nt|djneill:  meanwhile back in the real world, the other table stopped in 2NT on brd 18 after East chose to rebid hearts rather than NT|pg||
nt|lml: well actually I love Australia.  Will you adopt me?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: you bewdy glad yu do|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: for those who like to see very long descriptions     1@C=a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=any 7+ HCP|pg||
nt|nickd:  hello, 1@c=15+ 1@d= semipositive 3-9 points any|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Anybody for 1@S now by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting second action by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S is privy to the info that E mnight have a stiff spade, then yes|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: No need to bid 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=17-21 HCP  5440 or 4441 with short @C/@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Bilski was struggling to recall if this was the right rebid, now Prescott is trying to work it out too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm cheating -- looking at notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  @H win in South  @H win in North  THEN @C|pg||
nt|djneill:  so a small swing to Neill|pg||
nt|yr: the strong @c by N & negative response by S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: what is this alert of 2nt|pg||
nt|djneill:  wow, 5@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: damn i thought i was here to ESCAPE the real world...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Neill's 4@S has produced a big pickup, now it's almost all square|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: alerts explanations reversed|pg||
nt|yr: hi nick tx & welcome|pg||
nt|aconterno: NS can make 3@c if finds Jx|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 3@S=RELAY     4@S=5=4=0=4|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: uh oh   i think 4@D says   4=4=0=5|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: prescott looks at 4@D incredulously|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D would be right shape for a weaker hand than the 3@H rebid|pg||
nt|peachy: this would be a tricky hand to bid in any system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A+ for your homework Al.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|nickf: I think North bid 6H, not Westr|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont think W would bid 6H vulnerable|pg||
nt|djneill:  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: East looking puzzled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not more than me|pg||
nt|loganrun: South had to throw a top heart and win the first heart and lead back to north's Queen - very tough|pg||
nt|nickd:  2@c shows 3 spades and 7-9|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think that Sydney is the best city there is with maybe Vancouvre as second|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: nytime|pg||
nt|yr: there should be no play problems in 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: 3N is bad, with direction to "horrible" :)|pg||
nt|aconterno: @d lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: yuk|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yup Michael knew it was a 4405|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what is 1D?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even corrected, here is an auction you dont see every decade|pg||
nt|aconterno: bad contract|pg||
nt|aconterno: N should bid 3@c|pg||
pc|d2|nt|djneill:  often times the bid is right, but pd will not understand it, I don't think either happened here|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Haughie dropped 5h on Club lead - not happy|pg||
nt|yr: ruffing a @d  brings the total to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: noit without play|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil knows Mike likely has a penalty double of 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously -- there were more tricks available in @D than declarer will see in @C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: unbalanced real suit is my guess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: standard-ish|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok good info thank you Judy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: pushy 3NT may need some assstance from the defence|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jkotor: now Q@d|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Nick -- tell them they both remembered incorrectly :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tejjyid: natural-esque|pg||
nt|lml: well the club return was a killer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|djneill:  so South is playing on the fact West must play the penalty card on the first @h, even if he holds the @hK!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if N id unsure what 5H means, what he does knwo uis that almost all his strength consists of cards that S probably doesnt care about since only red suits have been bid|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: in this case a club lead seems a better bet than a heart lead in my view|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: in that case i mean|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jkotor: i dont understand this play with middle numbers when all we have on side is AQ@s|pg||
nt|aconterno: must take A, for maximum damage|pg||
nt|aconterno: down 1 in OR, with @s lead and @d back|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3rd NS game without points and sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: kotorowicz  th√Ωnk√Ωng  |pg||
nt|aconterno: 2 imps decision|pg||
nt|exerdar: i have to go , thx all :-)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphA2: North knows he likely has this beaten by playing @DJ and @DK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the new fashion, alert only the natural bids?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|djneill:  I think you are right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: best - quieter, saves time|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like David's inference about declarer having a penalty DBL of 1@H -- even though he pulled -- but why lead @H then??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: E could show heart strength here more easily thn he could show clubs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: not really a game you want to be in NV... VUL okay but NV not so much|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphA2: West wont enjoy two clubs|pg||

nt|lml: even vul it is pretty pushy|pg||
nt|frankaus: opp 12-14 I think 3NT pushy by S|pg||
nt|super nova: 1c Opening|pg||
nt|super nova: would you bid 2c spades and another?|pg||
nt|super nova: I like to play weak and strong micheals.|pg||
nt|yr: this looks like an exellent slam  for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: all N has is a fifth heart, but it does not feel like enough. after all S did not opoen 2C. in fact S indeed did even HAVE a 2C opener, yet slam was hopeless, so that says it all|pg||
nt|frankaus: S is a bridge teacher - represented Aus in Cannes some time ago|pg||
nt|super nova: This doesnt qualify so I would bid 1s over call.|pg||
nt|yr: in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickd:  1@c=15+ - 1@h=10+ unbalanced hand any|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphA2: Interesting position for North|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: I would fancy opening 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If I open at all which I will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N is attractive...let them figure it out on lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that hand was just destined for trouble -- there is no science for bidding hands with 5@D 7@C and singleton Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: You know you cant get doubled and you are playing for the money|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Partner has 10 outside diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: NO WAY would I open 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=(17)18-19 BAL-Semi BAL|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H a good bid for North here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble maybe|pg||
nt|nickd:  i suppose the answer will be|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: spec suggest that in fourth seat, 3m should be a transfer to 3N:)|pg||
nt|lml: I like a spade.  The @CQ is not a good card|pg||
nt|yr: @d preemption may actually help  here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: there's a fun twist for the viewers|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2C - 18/19 bal?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Reese describes a set of hands where raising the overcall with a Doubleton honour is best; this seems like one|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok normal 1@c opening, but 1@d is the equivalent of a 1@h response|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome Jamie Ebery|pg||
nt|yr: i think it will be difficult to find slam if EW never bid @d at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: interesting theoretical/practical issue for W on first round -- make sure u show the four spades and clarify strength later? or make sure you shoiw values and fish for spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: later? i am in the latter camp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: reese never heard of LOTT|pg||
nt|djneill:  (and 1@h would have been a 1@s response)|pg||
nt|djneill:  a Jacobini transfer|pg||
nt|lml: hi Jamie :)|pg||
nt|super nova: Hi :-)|pg||
nt|super nova: I guess we have talked the lightner double on board 6 to death.|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: ty Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=Puppet 2N|pg||
nt|djneill:  but East does not have to accept - 1@h promises @h tolerance|pg||
nt|super nova: WOW 16 imps.|pg||
nt|yr: but in any case, a splinter now should do the trick|pg||
nt|yr: i wonder what 2@c showed,,Nick?|pg||
nt|nickd:  splinter wont be enough, but i think nirth will bid once more after splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: I would try 3@D on second round inviting 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If partner passes here you get the worst of both worlds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what 4th seat 2@D opening is for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, double vs. 2C|pg||
nt|nickd:  about 2@c i am not sure because over competition there are 2 approaches|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: an artificial 2C rebid is a useful tool|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he divine the @H situation??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NO, he never did, and yet still managed to bid quite well. WHich suggests something about LOTT|pg||
nt|super nova: sorry board 4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: east-west wimped out so it was not a question at this table|pg||
nt|frankaus: they found the X ruff in 6@C|pg||
nt|super nova: This shows a forcing 6 card heart suit.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphA2: I cant believe North is thinking here|pg||
nt|peachy: the moment.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS may be playing rosenkranz X & XX so forced to XX to show an honor, which a raise over the double would deny|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3H is forcing|pg||
nt|lml: some wires got crossed|pg||
nt|super nova: But it seems that east doesnt like their hand.|pg||
nt|lml: east-west do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand I cant see what they can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they make 3NT??|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.|pg||
nt|yr: splinter means that your values are in @h & @c,,,jsut wat S wanted to hear|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now simple Stayman|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: that decides the fate of the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now maybe an overtrick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid 2@C as well|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as in 'it is not clear what they make'|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: why would this EW auction ven be forcing? ne of the problems with an initial double|pg||
nt|djneill:  with various checkbacks available, the jumps may be forcing|pg||
nt|djneill:  3NT was odd however|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: i mean, from W point of view why would 3C be forcing?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm suprised @C was adequate|pg||
nt|yr: but of course he has a minimum forcing @c & tries to sign off,,,,but N wont let him off the hook here|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not that odd -- 11 of his 14 points are in unbid suits|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: he is thinking how lucky he is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice pressure bid|pg||
nt|lml: not clear|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: amazing pass, given the @D Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the D flaw ntwithstanding|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes it depends if West is looking for slam potentially since East has a slam oriented hand with a @s cue|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|nickd:  yes splinter was possible even without Qh|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: but probably just make|pg||
nt|yr: very well bid slam in the end,,,its a claimer|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|nt|peachy: he needed just one heart trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is possible that 3N there was a spade cuebid, allowing them to use the step bid of 3S as a grope of some sort|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H = likely + will prob be a + imps as well|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just delaying the inevitable claim for 9 tricks ??|pg||
nt|lml: they do have to make it though|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: 2c was puppet to 2d i think, but the pass is simply not consistent|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: best lead to give defense a chance was king of clubs. looks absurd of course but it is amazing how often it is right from this holdiong|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|frankaus: seems to be on the right track|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: when in dummy  I think trump gives play for overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using 2@C opening this way, they can actually get out in 2@H/@S via transfers   interesting concept|pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazing is an amazing euphemism:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: montanar√Ω cla√Ωmed|pg||
mc|7|nt|lml: the defense is not going to work out for north-sotuh|pg||

pc|s9|nt|tejjyid: yes, best chance for ruff |pg||

nt|djneill:  ok, North was giving a little credit to West to ducking the first heart|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another transfer explanation|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok South doubles the completely artificial 2@d bid to indicate some strength, some play it shows balanced, some a takeout of a major in particular|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will NS go on over 4S?|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|loganrun: Another 'percentage' action|pg||
nt|lml: on Board 9 the defense lost their way a bit and 3NT made.  Declarer ran 4 hearts and West through a club which was fatal|pg||

nt|super nova: North decides to show their 6-5 shape. fair enough.|pg||
nt|super nova: Ace of diamonds and diamond continuations I would imagine to be the best defence.|pg||
nt|lml: on a non-diamond lead the diamond can go away|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have seen a plethora of singleton Kings this match|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: holey moley - suh 8magination|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: 10 cold anyway it would seem|pg||

pc|s4|nt|vugrapha2: 3 on the one board was my fav.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 fell to the Ace -- but the 3rd snuck through to beat the contract|pg||

nt|ahollan1: just 2 more boards for our table in this set|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: We have another game from this tournament in 3 days time. Hope you can join us|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and such a boring one to start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose, 1 round forcing 1@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|super nova: 2c|pg||
nt|super nova: D or Majors|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: Whibley started with 2@C rather than Prescott's DBL|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: South says 1NT is clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. W is a LOT closer to bidding 4H over an invitation than E is to bidding 4. for several reasons, in fact...for example, if they do bid 4S how will you feel?|pg||
nt|djneill:  seemed like a good shot, very unlikely to set that 4@s otherwise on this auction|pg||
nt|super nova: I would X = some values with south.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Neill surges further ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hehe  the psychic transfer|pg||
nt|lml: I guess it depends what you play double as.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: North maybe throwing smoke in the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  Suction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here ius something u dont see every day. a 20/20 hand with no voids and eaxh side can make gam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry only one void|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Lavings in deep thought|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tactical bidding situation|pg||
nt|lml: I think pass is the normal call.|pg||
nt|super nova: As 2c doesnt have an Anchor suit I usually play it as 'some values' |pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|vugrapha2: South thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it may stop EW from competing -- but what about partner?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: NS are not a regular partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems like 3@S overstates the non existent defense|pg||
nt|super nova: The same as over multi '2d' opening.|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=constructive   7-10 HCP, 3+@S|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Three obvious losers but some work to be done here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H splinter?   is that really the agreement or just Nabil's intent??|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphA2: So we can see the OR went -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still NS have a sac but 5@S home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear what N is up to, without knowing their understandings. might be trying to buy it in hearts as cheaply as possible by pretending to sound slammish|pg||
pc|d6|nt|djneill:  West, a passed hand, has a great hand for @h - a 4@h here seems reasonable - as East might have 16-17 so a 3@h is courtesy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugrapha2: Hung grinnign whne he puts down dummy|pg||
nt|djneill:  oof|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hi|pg||

pc|hA|nt|super nova: I think jurovic likes Kalmins auction also.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|lml: the lure of the vul game is too much|pg||
nt|super nova: This wont play too badly.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S presumably constructive, as otyherwise E just has an inbvite|pg||
pc|h2|nt|super nova: 2d diamonds and a spade off the top.|pg||

pc|h7|nt|super nova: KH on side but the and singelton KC,|pg||

nt|ahollan1: suddenly Nick is too scared to type to the room     in Zone 7  Suction is known as TWERB|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: essentially  a suit bid shows  either  a) the next suit up   or   b) the other 2 suits|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: declare cant really draw trump and get hearts going with the bad break|pg||
pc|d5|nt|super nova: It is going to promote the 8.|pg||
nt|lml: not to mention the diamond ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and a questionable invite at that, with bad trumps and a gaggle of queens|pg||
nt|loganrun: North had both!! - just in case partner forgot|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this is a very thin game for EW, but it does not look as though it can be defeated - unless East plays clubs in a peculiar fashion  |pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  South could try the @sA and @sQ, spurning the finesse - if they take @sK then 9 tricks|pg||

pc|d7|nt|yr: Should end in 6@d, else they should try a natural system:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|r|mb|2C|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|saverio: dbl here by E shows 2/3 cards in @c|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks Kenan for a terrific presentation.  And thanks, too, to Saverio for all those useful perspectives.|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c2|nt|othered1: EW have to get their tricks early before @H get set up for @S pitch.   And that m ight alos pick up @C|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: Will declarer try two rounds of trumps then @H?  Of course when @CQ comes down, he'll take another round and claim an overtrick|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: This could be the first double digit swing of the match|pg||
nt|isp: +1|pg||
nt|othered1: If declarer knows east's double showed 2 or 3 cards, two rounds of trumpos are attractive|pg||
nt|saverio: E showed 11 points till now so he should have the @c Q  but he is also in third seat so he could have opened light|pg||

nt|yr: so huge board for Netherlands, 16 imps & they go into the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW in OR not shining in their slam bidding |pg||
nt|mdgraham: same start as before :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|yr: thats why i prefer Natural methods!|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so 3@D=hearts. Just a question of six or seven now, you would think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and I bet on seven|pg||
nt|yr: E never bid his 6 or 5 card suit in the other room:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, East showed @C's first and they never found their fit|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think 2NT was an inv+ xfr to @C in the other room.|pg||
nt|warrens:  the 3@S bid by S took up a lot of room|pg||
nt|yr: & the 4@s bid by E ensured that none was left|pg||
nt|yr: this is the last board of this session|pg||
nt|yr: the next sesion starts in about 75 minutes from now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@S as exclusion roman? |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|wstuart: the question now is, do they have a way to ask for the Q here?  :)|pg||
nt|yr: now 7,,,,,so iceland will lose sumthing like 33 imps in the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|yr: his response will show 2 with q|pg||
nt|yr: 2kc outside @s with q of trumps|pg||
nt|wstuart: true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes....just a little time to work it out, not something that happens every day|pg||
nt|wstuart: but had he bid 6@D, what would east do?|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|wstuart: or 6@C I mean|pg||
nt|wstuart: would 6@D be a Q ask there?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if that is ERKCB, that should be two aces outside spades + @HQ |pg||
nt|yr: over a 0314 response, it shd be|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: 6h √Ωs alerted  by muller |pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming a "standard" response style |pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yr: this has been a very tight match,,,but it ends with a bang, 36 imps to NEtherlands in the last 2 boards|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: a wise conversion to 7@H|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
