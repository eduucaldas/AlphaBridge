nt|ian111:  if he thought the D were 3-3 he could have relied on the long D for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Arun from India|pg||
nt|xenya: 7-card suits are mandatory in this set?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  big double fit here for NS but only 10 tricks in 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the save in 5@c is likely which might push NS to 5@h|pg||
nt|arunbapat: Hi |pg||
mb|1S|nt|mango joe: Its the only comparison we have so far. Kibs can check comparisons by clicking on MOVIE at the bottom of your screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Asimple 4@H here... tough to reach?!?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: and he played it very fast ...|pg||
nt|ian111:  board 17 flat - but I preferred Spear's line|pg||
nt|mrdct:  gill might splinter in @h if available|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ian111:  a C at trick 2|pg||
nt|mrdct:  or introduce a clever psyche with a view to retreating to @c later|pg||
nt|mango joe: good result for Australia in closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: likely collect 2@H and then South will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|mango joe:  West cud hv made a negative X one wud hv thought|pg||
nt|mrdct:  as south, i like to keep 2@H as a natural bid in this auction|pg||
nt|mrdct:  north might suspect west has psyched now!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ian111:  yes - X seems normal|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4@H is a make|pg||
nt|khaled_m: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 3@D now may get them there...|pg||
nt|figo: that he does almost always|pg||
nt|ian111:  4H very close|pg||
nt|mrdct:  actually - undo all of those comments - i believe EW play transfer over their 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mrdct:  1@h will just be showing 4+ @s|pg||
nt|mango joe: looks like only 89 tricks on likely @H lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct:  whilst NS can be held to 10 tricks, that depends of a defence of two black aces at tricks 1 & 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@H is 4 +@S|pg||
nt|mango joe: 8 lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: or 4@H as you say!|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D for us mere mortals!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@d MIGHT DO IT AND IT WILL GO OFF |pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: not great but @Hs 2-2 and @C finesse on|pg||
nt|ian111:  e/w recovered to bif 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: easy to miss slam here which needs either @Cs to come in or @S 3-3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ian111:  bid |pg||
nt|ian111:  N/S take the red save - might go -2|pg||

pc|h9|nt|garnetts: sorry caps lock  try A@C and three rounds of @D s|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure even I could go down!|pg||
nt|mango joe: a good vul sacrifice if he gets @S right|pg||
nt|mango joe: E will have to find 4 discards on the run of @cx and may have to bare his K@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct:  this looks to be one or two down - so a lost opportunity for australia|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west has perhaps already shown his hand with his 1@S bid and ought to have left the 5-level decision to compete to east|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: Hi Mike|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ian111:  as so often - no one able to double|pg||
nt|mango joe: so Australia draws level|pg||
pc|s6|nt|viren169: 5 @H + 3@S + 2 ruffs = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should find this defence |pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice @D3|pg||
nt|mango joe: nice bidding sequence in other room after weak NT opening by West|pg||
pc|s4|nt|viren169: have I missed something?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ian111:  in 2C at the other table !|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but australia in the other room have the result well covered with an overtrick in 4@h|pg||
nt|mango joe: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Hello Sajid|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|suketbombi: may be t was better wud induce a @S shift from Bhabesh|pg||
nt|figo: now E is surprised by D 9|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Ten|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: east thinking|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may manage to get 6 tricks Chotan|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Sumit and Kachhu chatting all the time :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes They Both are from Sangh|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: in Bengali...cant understand |pg||

nt|suketbombi: Bhikari Sangh|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: will learn ....sitting behind these guys |pg||
nt|mango joe: so 2 imps at stake|pg||

pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|garnetts: unless I am blind this will beat it |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: What was east thinking|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mrdct:  although gosnet is in some danger of losing control here and going for 800 or more|pg||
nt|mrdct:  gosney|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but the good news is that north doesn't have any more @d to pump at him|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: west is pondering|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: some annoying communication problems here -- but 9 tricks are there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Is that an attempted Grosvenor Gambit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually, no - attempting to interfere with the communicaitons|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct:  if he thinks the @sK is still, his best line is to win @SA and run @c to shorten north's trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h3|nt|mango joe: Spears didnt think he had enough for  a vulnerable overcall|pg||
nt|mango joe: in 6 I am sure he would play on @S before drawing trumps|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|khaled_m: Need 2 of the 3 finesses to be right. And also need the clubs to behave normally.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: has to set up a trick in either black suit now -- hmm...|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|suketbombi: shd not have cashed @HQ bhabesh|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: a third @D should be obvious |pg||
pc|h8|nt|viren169: ahhhhh... true|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|mango joe: has played for @S to be 3-3 so will end up as flat board|pg||

nt|vicky888:  Hello all, hi mahesh :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Vicky|pg||
nt|mango joe: a 2@C opening in precision often has a  card major as it did in this case at the other table|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4 card major|pg||
nt|mrdct:  4@h for EW looks good here|pg||
nt|mango joe: he had a chance to test the @S and then perhaps guess if E had Kx or W had 10x @H|pg||
nt|mango joe: once @S didnt break|pg||
nt|mango joe: cards lie nicely for E/W here|pg||
nt|mango joe: good duck of @H by Arun|pg||
nt|xenya: that @H was a wrong move |pg||
nt|mdgraham: what about playing a spade and jettisoning the @HA? |pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||

mb|1D|nt|paulg:  do you transfer to clubs with the South hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Thx Roland Hi all namaste Arunda|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double-dummy of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: we have a strong club |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: today the drinks are on the house ...by the organisers|pg||
nt|viren169: and one for you, no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is routine now |pg||
nt|vicky888:  Amazing start for Hemant Jalan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: A fit Jump by Rana showing hand better than 4@h|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mango joe: easy 3NT here for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: 6@C and 6NT both make though very unlikely to be bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|viren169: We are in the wrong place!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: o|pg||
nt|vicky888:  light 3rd seat opening will need to take out to 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: still 11 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and I also will act as W now - non vulnerable|pg||
nt|mango joe: wonder what 2@S is, its certainly not weak but 9 tricks seems to be the limit here with 2 trump losers|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  it is interesting, as it has to play three tricks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: That is a nice touch--wish they would do that here too  --well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Sandy Duncan is one of the most conservative bidders that I know ... a very solid and sound player|pg||
nt|mrdct:  stiff @cA is a little bit hard to evaluate - but west has nothing more to say than 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  @s lead best for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@sx pass interesting other room|pg||
nt|xenya: winning play |pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct:  the double of 4@c might have meant "don't lead a @c"|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|mango joe: another good board for Poddar|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: looks like a strong 1@C auction to 4@H here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure what 2@S was meant to achieve--3@H looked better--stronger than a direct 4@H |pg||
nt|viren169: just showing 4@S on the way - I guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: 11 tricks--next |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: let @cK win|pg||
nt|paulg:  is Duncan still thinking?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks more like a deadlock:)|pg||

nt|viren169: Oh dear... Flat board - I lost again!|pg||
nt|mango joe: this should mke unless he plays @S to K|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@H is not an odds on contract and will fail here unless declerer plays for a 4/1 @H after discovering 6/2 @DS|pg||
nt|mango joe: he shud be able to do it when W doesnt try to give East a ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: now all should be clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there's not a lot to go on - given East is short in hearts, North may well go wrong|pg||
nt|mango joe: but W can give E ast a ruff if the latter had a trump|pg||
nt|xenya: no Mike, Sajid is right|pg||
pc|cA|nt|suketbombi: 2@S was a forced bid on which Rana showed @HS and @Cs+ game force|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West won't play @hA and another - which may alert a suspicious North|pg||
pc|c7|nt|garnetts: oddly enough 2-1 scores here because it will start either with 1@D or 1@C and the 1NT response will show up to a about 11 and clubs which will shut east up for the right reasons |pg||
nt|suketbombi: Mahesh can we have the udate on scores?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes sorry that was for 7@H:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Aus were 400+ hemant jalan 395...india 1 385 ....india 2 375 |pg||
nt|ian111:  needs to get the S right to make this|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mango joe: all roads seem to lead to -2 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: questions asked b4 lead|pg||
nt|mango joe: on bidding K@C stands out|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mango joe: declarer may go for both @D honours with N in order to try make|pg||
nt|mango joe: only hope|pg||
nt|suketbombi: luckily stayed out of what I must say an odds on Slam|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzat: http://61.247.239.200:8080/cba/jspCWB2010index.jsp|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct:  actually - doen't make any diff - just a technique thing|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|garnetts: I am not a fan of giving up like this---when defending always try and think about how you might beat the contract--at least when its not pairs |pg||
nt|mango joe: unlikely now|pg||
nt|mango joe: surprisingly even 4@S went off in the other room so not much damage|pg||
nt|xenya: looks obvious doesn't it|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry - I should read the comments :)|pg||
nt|mango joe: it sure does |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|figo: now escape in down 3|pg||
nt|ian111:  north already short in H|pg||
nt|mango joe: endplay comimg up soon|pg||
pc|h3|nt|suketbombi: what happens if 3 indian Teams qualify which is likely here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Arvind will let u know|pg||
nt|suketbombi: my comments earlier were for 7@H|pg||
nt|figo: before this last rd , scores are : Australia 419 , Jalan 395 , India 1 385|pg||
nt|mango joe: defence have to play a @C at some point to cut communications|pg||
nt|mango joe: like right now|pg||
nt|mango joe: anything else gives the contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: rana would not be too happy here but difficult to Judge as @CJ playes a vital role|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mango joe: wd|pg||
nt|ian111:  well done|pg||
nt|mango joe: now 2 off as N will signal for @cs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|garnetts: The @D has come too late |pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm not sure why he didn;'t elimnate @d first|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|mrdct:  but this is a big game swing for australia and give the formidables a mountain to climb now|pg||

nt|paulg:  For latecomers, Scotland has already won the Gold medal as the leading national team|pg||

nt|mango joe: with only 6 boards to go|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: india 2 will need draw |pg||
nt|mrdct:  sry i meant eliminate @h first|pg||
nt|mrdct:  a somewhat unorthodox vulnerabel 1@s overcall on just Q9xxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I suspect East will bid 4@H|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You can postpone that if hearts are OK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|suketbombi: but what happens if 3 indian teams qualify?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Hemant Jalan anyways not eligible for any Medals...Im i right Arvind|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct:  south might've tried for a miracle game here given the state of the match|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but even 2NT is in danger here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mango joe: both 3N & 4@S ok here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes true iam saying if @HS were Ok @CJ was vital on a @D lead|pg||
nt|arunbapat: 3NT by W is on will Rana Bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|arunbapat: No|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes medal is not the end of the world mahesh and One of the Hemant Jalan Team Member has a  CWG medal|pg||
nt|mango joe: e?W playing either weak or variable NT|pg||
nt|mrdct:  although 3-3 @h will please declarer|pg||
nt|mango joe: @Hs are 3-3, @Cs are blocked, A@D is right & @S finesse is right|pg||
nt|mrdct:  entries to dummy are limited though - he may not be abel to lead @d towards hand twice|pg||
nt|mango joe: 5 losers i can see|pg||
nt|xenya: W didn't continue hearts because he knew E was out of trumps at that point|pg||
nt|xenya: last hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7222 is a nasty shape for a vulnerable pre-empt - still, the suit is reasonable|pg||
pc|h5|nt|viren169: What would you have bid David with East's hand?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is an interesting auction--North could not find a bid over 2@H --but in my view should have over 3@H |pg||
pc|h8|nt|suketbombi: @CT lead wod have been a hit:)|pg||
nt|mango joe: 3@S 4@H + 1@D shud be easy|pg||
nt|mrdct:  yes - 2NT is cold|pg||
nt|mrdct:  if playing on @D, most liekly it will be low to the 10|pg||
nt|mango joe: if he leads a @D now|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes thats possible|pg||
nt|mango joe: he will probably play on @Hs next|pg||
nt|mango joe: could be a big swing to Australia who seem to have the momentum|pg||
pc|h9|nt|figo: wow|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @S lead and @H shift in good time|pg||
nt|mango joe: weak NT very popular in the UK|pg||
nt|mango joe: 2@D is asking about major suit holdings|pg||
nt|mango joe: West is denying 3@S or 4@H|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have bid 4@H as East|pg||
nt|viren169: 3 looks a bit wet for my liking...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Anal has a Gold in last CWG if I am not mistakev?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: u right |pg||
nt|suketbombi: Thx Mahesh|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  this should go down when they find the heart ruff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzat: he heard u Raju|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzat: open room in 4@h im told|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H pre-emptively is likely to get them in too often |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h2|pc|d5|nt|viren169: North had 1 eye on the vul I guess...|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

nt|suketbombi: @H & yelling for @S|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: no|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  good switch!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|garnetts: after 3@H North might try 3NT  for the minors or in view the double implies minors as he might have acted before with spades |pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|paulg:  less good switch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|suketbombi: no more @S discard anal:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Duncan still needs to return a diamond otherwise it will disappear|pg||
nt|mrdct:  if @h are 3-3 he only needs 1 @d trick buy if @H are 4-2 he needs 2 @d tricks - but he doesn't know how many @d tricks he needs until after he's exhausted his entries to dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|viren169: Dble is more flexible...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|ian111:  maybe they play weak in 4th|pg||
nt|mango joe: 12 now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|arunbapat: No double from Manas may may be 4333 discouraged him..would be expecting a reopening from P with suitable hand.No action from Rana too was surprising..he is very aggresive |pg||

mb|1S|nt|figo: penalty ?|pg||

nt|mrdct:  i'm not sure what west's dbl means. perhaps a side 4-card suit where bidding 3@d would show 5-5|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: if Hemant jalan eam win here...the winner of the Aus vs Scotland will win the gold medal|pg||

nt|garnetts: They have also pinpointed the defence too --no heart control |pg||
nt|viren169: North was hoping they went on!|pg||
nt|garnetts: North should lead the A@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: this will clear things up for him|pg||

nt|mango joe: 5@S shows Q@H i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
nt|mango joe: can he find out about Q@S?|pg||
nt|mango joe: he cant bid 7 with any surety|pg||
nt|mango joe: he knows abut K@D A@C and Q to four @hs|pg||
nt|mango joe: and he knows that N will have a bit more for his opening |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: hoping that partner has @sq also|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes but it will be on a hope rather than certainty|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can understand the @s lead from E|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps i am wrong about the last hand -- if S doesn't open, EW may well get to 3N or 4@H, with some good practical chances of making|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|mango joe: or QJ@D to 4|pg||
nt|mango joe: KQJ i mean|pg||
nt|mango joe: they say never to bid 7 unless u can count 13 and Uttam made a wise decision|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|ian111:  Hemant |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: This is a board, wher you have to choose betwenn 5 ot 7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will show a weak 2@H and South will bid game|pg||
mb|3S|an|alert|nt|ian111:  it was close with about 8 boards to play, but ended up over 40 to Hemant|pg||
nt|mango joe: 2@H shows less than 4 points normally, its the weakest response|pg||
nt|xenya: oh 2@D was a multi? -- I must confess I wouldn't have thought of using it with this hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  if North would bypass a 4-card diamond suit to bid 1NT, as many would, then pass is an option that would not work out well|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  but Duncan-Gordon are pretty old-school and so retreating to clubs looks sensible|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|paulg:  when holding long trumps it is often best to lead your own long suit, rather than a singleton, to try and force declarer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he is wary about their Game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four-card support and all that - still, he is a bit thin in the high-card department|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this should play ok despite the 4-1 trump split - West will spend the whole hand being endplayed  |pg||
pc|hT|nt|andybe: should ask for attitude|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct:  this will be 1 or 2 down i think|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the @h pips work well for declarer though - so he should make at least 6 tricks now and where there is a 6th there si often a 7th|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: poddar through easily|pg||
nt|mango joe: this has no chance and will go 1 or 2 off depending on whether they can engineer a @C ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s on E or do you show a 2-suiter? |pg||

nt|suketbombi: abattle of partials here 4@D is the par tho|pg||

mb|5D|nt|paulg:  in my system, it would be 3@c to show non-strong spades and clubs|pg||
nt|mango joe: puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Duncan's bid depends on their methods after a reverse ... some play 2NT as artificial (with weak hands)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now E? do you regret only 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: yet to get a push board|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|mango joe: 2 1/2 maybe :)|pg||

nt|paulg:  3NT probably suggests a weak club stop|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Gordon has nowhere to go .. he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: usually the weaker hand bids the major he doesnt have |pg||
nt|ian111:  4S by E might make on CJ lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  are the results on the web anywhere?|pg||
nt|mango joe: 9 top tricks now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that he will be all that excited by his hand anyway|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzat: see hcl website|pg||
nt|mrdct:  both 5@c and 3NT depend on the @s hook|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  this should be beaten on a club lead, as long as West does not cover the @sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  given West's poor spade intermediates, this should be easy to avoid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so much for that bet ;(|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  this will play well with the doubleton club with north and the @d10 preventing a force|pg||

nt|paulg:  or playing West for 98xx|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mango joe: at least the @H guess was easier|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the HCL website only seems to have hte results up to round 9 of the swiss|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: jalan 105-alfa 74|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: next vugraph in 5 minutes time|pg||
nt|mango joe: so 3 Indian teams in the semis|pg||
nt|mango joe: there was a problem with communicatios so only 9 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: declarer claimed 10 and accepted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 62 in 5 - not impossible, but you would lay long odds |pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|nt|paulg:  it's a compromise that was expensive this time, but gains in simplicity|pg||
nt|mango joe: the number of good Indian teams here is really impressive|pg||
nt|mango joe: its been a fantastic 10 days, pity about this one sided final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for a start, NS need to bid 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: 41 imps 5 boards|pg||
nt|ian111:  particularly to Subhash - the main orgnaniser|pg||
nt|mango joe: thats that then|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2@S alerted as lead direction with @d fit|pg||
nt|andybe: will be difficult for NS to reach 3S now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 12 on top. Let us see if they get there|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@S is a great contract but 6@H also will go unpunished and so will 6 NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg:  this looks a much quieter affair|pg||
nt|ian111:  organiser |pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: 6@C is 500|pg||

nt|mango joe: dont understand that lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Manas will blackwood here to find 3 aces and a void|pg||
nt|mango joe: all the visitors must have enjoyed their trp as the hospitality in India is fantastic|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: well, if 3@S sets spades unconditionally, you can - but you need to discuss it first |pg||
pc|h4|nt|ian111:  3C was going off - so now needs to make 3D|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: next seg at 9.30 am local time|pg||
nt|mango joe: @D position is good for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Arun Jain 85 vs Magic eyes 53|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they are a disscussed partnership Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one would expect no less :) |pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  it's not clear that 3@c should make either on 27|pg||
nt|k ylinen: 11 imps|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ian111:  looks like 3NT is difficult to make |pg||
nt|ian111:  but west is going to come under pressure|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mango joe: so 3 Indian teams in semis possibly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andybe: with the spade ruff this will be down 2 for 3 imps to AJ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no prefers not to show the void|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ian111:  oh dear - now the H run|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mango joe: still 500 to Arun Jain|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what I meant was, it's not something you would unleash with a casual partner   |pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzat: i more seg to go Sajid|pg||
nt|ian111:  he wants to lead a 3rd C , but can't|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Formidables playing |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: will keep u posted|pg||
pc|s5|nt|suketbombi: poor contract but as said will go un punished|pg||

nt|suketbombi: wanted to protect his @C K|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the play won't take very long....|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was counting 11 tricks with 7@S and and 2 red tricks each and will make 6nt if he finds either @CQ or @DQ reasonable|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: looks like the train has gone....|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: cards picked in wrong axixs|pg||
nt|mango joe: 6@C on @H guess here|pg||
nt|fugitiv: and spades|pg||
nt|fugitiv: good contract|pg||
nt|fugitiv: the south hand is worth alot more than 14 with the sharp cards, intermediates, and nice 5 card suit|pg||
nt|k ylinen: no need to guess, cause S is favorably devided|pg||
nt|mango joe: The % play in @S is to play for J to drop|pg||
nt|fugitiv: NS do not play inverted minors I am told|pg||
nt|mango joe: S has a difficult bid then|pg||
nt|fugitiv: 3nt is a bal 13-15 raise|pg||
nt|fugitiv: but Ian must like his hand too much|pg||
nt|mango joe: sure|pg||
nt|fugitiv: 2nt is a raise weak or strong I am told|pg||
nt|fugitiv: 1c is four plus (acol)|pg||
nt|mango joe: he might bid !1H|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: sorry west took a toilet break|pg||
nt|fugitiv: ah-hah!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andybe: balanced fit showing jump 13-15|pg||
nt|suketbombi: bd 38 Ausies too missed the 6@H (which does not make) so now they are in a strong position from here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: this likely to be passed|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Khaled|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  As expected, the wild hand of board 10 was flat in 4@s-2|pg||
mb|2D|nt|khaled_m: For statistics lovers 7-6 distribution is a 1 in 18,000 hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, you don't mind missing slams that don't make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: :) depends which side you are on tho:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i'm surprised west did not compete here|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: can see Aus and Ind players from open room leaving ...will let u know the result of that match|pg||
nt|xenya: methods commonly used against a strong 1N may prove ineffective against 12-14 -- as the last hand goes to show|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, the NS hands are a perfect fit - no spade wastage|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: mbv 53 here with me he is ctd|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  thanks|pg||
nt|xenya: you are more likely to have a balance of power in the latter case|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|andybe: can hardly blame N with such a defensive hand and so many points but 5NT is a big shape bid|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|paulg:  I know partner is a passed hand, but you do have five clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mango joe: 3 boards to go|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  the play-off is only 28 boards, so should finish first|pg||
nt|paulg:  silver and bronze medals at stake, as only national teams can win medals|pg||
nt|ralfwil: board 26 looks a little bit odd - 2@h on 30 high points....|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|nt|paulg:  a bidding mistake ... forgot the system|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: indeed Mike, but they didn't even give it a try -- and probably couldn't do it |pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|fugitiv: personally I prefer x to 3h, though it has this downside|pg||

nt|mdgraham: providing you guess the hearts.... |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzat: close to 1200 kibs in both room|pg||

mb|d|mb|1S|nt|mango joe: all credit to India|pg||

mb|d|nt|paulg:  Duncan will probably double here|pg||
nt|fugitiv: hard to believe|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fugitiv: but there you go, I'm told 2h might have been a canape overcall, like 4 spades and alonger|pg||
nt|mango joe: maybe 2N shows @cs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will compete up to 3@S on possible 3@C bid from N|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fugitiv: 2nt showed 5-5 in the blacks|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  oops, typed too soon!|pg||

mb|p|nt|fugitiv: hard to see this going off|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes good @C position|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dangerous for West to bid on, though, as pard might not have much|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mango joe: 3@D 4@C 1@S 1@H it looks like|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mango joe: red K1s lying well for E/W and this 25% slam will come rolling home if they bid it|pg||
nt|mango joe: he might ply @D now and @H will come back but should be able to handle that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: serious undercompeting by NS here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  this looks like another 2/1 auction where they are having difficulty limiting their hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  it was the same on 24|pg||
nt|paulg:  after another 1@d-2@c auction|pg||
nt|mango joe: good lead though|pg||
nt|mango joe: there are some communication problems though|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no problem for declerar here 3@Ds 5@CS and a @H atleast|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mango joe: which just became worse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a common method is to use 1x-dbl-1@S-dbl=four spades, 2@S=five  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|mango joe: home now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  EW have outbid their counterparts in the other room and managed to give NS the last guess|pg||
nt|suketbombi: can afford a safety in Play in @Ds|pg||
nt|mango joe: just as well maybe because 4@H might make for E/W|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|paulg:  consolation imps for Scotland|pg||
nt|mango joe: maybe not on best defence|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: brb 1 min|pg||
nt|paulg:  It is interesting that the pair that most would consider their best (Spears & Murdoch) is not playing throughout the final|pg||
