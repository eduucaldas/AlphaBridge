nt|mamos: standings after first two rounds of this strong tournament at http://www.bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling2724.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S would be second negative so 2@C shows some values|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: cards are friendly|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sommer: yes, this will be easy - guess, it will be bid all over|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: not a hand of great interest  -- Butler style scoring I think  effectively imp Pairs    scored on 80-0 match basis|pg||
nt|mamos: ten boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The venue is the brand new Tivoli Congress Center right in the heart of Copenhagen with spectacular playing facilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: total imps across the field, two results scratched, with a cap at 40 imp  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pairs are given 40 imps so no negative scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't lose more than the 40 IMPs you have when you start|pg||
