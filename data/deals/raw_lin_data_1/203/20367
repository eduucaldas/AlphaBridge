nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: easy 4@H to start with |pg||
nt|othered1: A routine strong NT auction, perhaps, but today 4th seat 1N openers are relatively rare,  as someone finds a reason to open in front of them|pg||
nt|bobholl: p p p  1nt  p 2@D superaccept 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rado: hi all, welcome to round 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hey Rado,welcome :)|pg||

mb|1H|an|4+|nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: Israel leading by 21 vp's so they need 4 or 5 to won the event|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Dessy|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: good ed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: And south gets a psychic 1@D in.  Wonder if they play Precision style, where a 3rd seat 1@D psyche is almost free|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rado: and 1@D showing weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome all to Stara Zagora:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentator (alone so far) is Rado|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|rado: NS use precision with many scientific gadgets:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 2@S looks to be showing a @D fit as well as @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|rado: 10 teams, round robin 12 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hello Marshal|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome to you to|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: wonder what 2N was for them|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently a raise of some kind looking at the 4@s rebid|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: Can west be t hinking?  Partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: zdr dessy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rado: info at:http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rado: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far a very standard auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello :) to you too.. welcome|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H not showing length, as N is known to have a strong hand but did not reverse to 2@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: this will be a very routine 5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: the results http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|rado: first blood now , |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has already implied 5 spades but wishes to emphasize the suit due to its quality, and is not crazy about NT with no fit and some potential red- suit problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yeah:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good presume|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: going for some xruff maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: that may not work well if he loses 2@s, 1@h, 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, his best chance would be to get @d fin right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks to be a dull 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: simple 3 nt with 9 (or 10) tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|danilo1: 8 topp tricks ... but guess any lead by West will find ninth one (difficult to immagine @C lead)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: after 3S, though, the auction sort of petered out. both players have enough to try for slam. N despite the highcard minimum has a super hand with controls and a great suit and his ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: small doubleton in exactly the right place. S has 3 controls and a possible trick source and a potentially useful nine of clubs|pg||
nt|rado: Israel needs calm boards and Vito - wild ones:)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Still onluy 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  *only|pg||
nt|danilo1: y|pg||
nt|psyck:  2 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome R@H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not made (yet)|pg||
nt|psyck: not a great game with only 1 entry to dummy & not enough tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@H now is best|pg||
nt|psyck: would often go down even with @h fin on, & no chance here|pg||
nt|rado: 3@S makable and 3@H down one|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen really hit the best lead.|pg||
nt|psyck:  6 feet 9 inches|pg||
nt|psyck:  9.5|pg||
nt|granguru:  skov6.791338|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. since North shown 4-card @H ... not easy lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And good evening to GeO Tislevoll in New Zealand|pg||

nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently he did try the x ruff & went down as suspected|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on 6@H good save|pg||
nt|bobholl: and a likely push|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of room for differing actions on this  hand, beginning with east's possible opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of options for the auction here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam is of course very playable on the NS cards, and possibly makeable via a squeeze (or pseudo)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: that what i see is ..auto squeeze :)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|zebutin: mighty try even 7@D|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone know their 1N range?|pg||
mb|d|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: the correct side will start bidding @d soon :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like their  headed to a @S fit|pg||
nt|geot: super fit here for E/W. can make all the tricks in a @H contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see the contract :)|pg||
nt|rado: 2NT is INV only with fit|pg||
mb|4C|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
nt|rado: 11 tricks in @S double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
mb|4H|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
nt|gluckenval: hi all and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hi there, welcome|pg||
nt|gluckenval: zdr Dessy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: seems NS use natural methods, not precision sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a colossally strong hand for a multi in most partnerships, even red|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting opening here|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but.. :) good contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/  updated after round 6. Israel in a very strong position|pg||
pc|c3|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|rado: 5 or 7 hand depending on K@D:)|pg||
nt|geot: In slam - on a club lead, it is on the @D finesse|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||
nt|rado: trump lead is good for defence but declarer still home with 3@C ruffs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Subhash Gupta|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|d3|nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck: lead was easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: NV, may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|offthebend: hello everybody|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow not best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ running scores|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzre: sorry crazy mouse :)|pg||
nt|rado: pessimistic approach by W , many would splinter 3@S |pg||
nt|geot: yes, so might as well be in 7 rather than 6, or just game|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are many situations like this in fourth seat where you want to open but are afraid of being outbid so you open with a preempt which  in last seat is of course not weak. here ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: however that is a questionable strategy, because 2D probably wont keep them out of spades if they have them. meanwhile partner could be something like 4153 and you end in hearts ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps down with  110 or 130 to make in diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi there:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Congrats Marshall!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some sort of record?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You just set a new BBO record: 5 lines of commentary|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good point :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hihi|pg||
nt|offthebend: is that really a record :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only because the chatspace is so narrow:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||
nt|othered1: best defense likely would have started by south leading the long suit |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|gmarco24: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hi welcome|pg||
nt|gluckenval: correct play in @H... really unlucky for declarer.... but it happens... (25% of times, more or less :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: this is not the best play in @h, slight better is A@h, @h to Q, since you can lose 2 tricks on KJ behind if you play finesse twice|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
mc|10|nt|granguru:  claim time already|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hi Ed, Bob|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a  hand that big @C systems handle quite well.|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good 7@H and biddable if S can show his singleton @C|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Henry!|pg||
nt|bobholl: think any reasanoble line will let 4@S make|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hristov is nervous,coz his p thinking so long abt this move|pg||
nt|geot: I agree Rado, If 2NT was defined as game invite only, I think West was a bit soft|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: welcome Hedy@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Dessy :)|pg||
nt|rado: hi Hedy welc|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  a small @c first improuves a little defense options|pg||
nt|Walddk2: San Marino is a state situated on the Italian peninsula on the eastern side of the Apennine Mountains. It is an enclave surrounded by Italy. Its size is just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with an estimated population of over 30,000. Its capital is the City of San Marino. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hi Rado:)|pg||
nt|offthebend: Hi rado |pg||
nt|hedyg: Rado :)|pg||
nt|rado: 6@H very cheap suppose no @D lead from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Not quite a 2@C bid, because  you run out of rebids pretty quickly|pg||
nt|phil: yes, declarer gets a good count on the hand when the 3rd diamond is played. I do think its stronger for North to duck that heart though, don;t you think? |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sunsamvar: BRAVE 1 NT BY e|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but it will make nevertheless|pg||
nt|geot: 3NT seems normal on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: P cud be yarborough|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: the results after round 3 3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some like sandwich NT (for other suits) & some like nat NT (since opps often open & respond light & steal you blind)...|pg||
nt|othered1: 7 is an excellent spot and may be biddable.  |pg||
nt|rado: W might use garbage stayman here |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: so many traps in here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3N by W looks good as cards lie|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland has the 'R' convention closely trailing the F & G conventions in the list of avoidable ones|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt x on a @S  lead :) wouldn't have found that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: for the results|pg||
nt|offthebend: only makeable game is 3NT by West -- hard to get there |pg||
nt|rado: and probably will end in 3NT by E|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: @S guess solved now so will make|pg||
nt|phil: me neither :)|pg||
nt|phil: but even on a heart, there arent a lot of tricks|pg||

pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: true CK but still a brave bid at unfav vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: playing NT as nat in that position, I would also bid 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all, sorry i am late:):(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S had not an obvious pass for some of us|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes a 53 major suit fit is not the key to the city. here 5C is a much more comfortable spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy it looks like W can get home, but there is work to be done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as the cards lie, even 6C is more comfortable than 4S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has every reason to think long and carefully here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though soon we may start wondering if the screen door has been raised:)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Marko, I think this could help you : http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_4.htm|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: on their way to 7 i guess|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: 3N by W is only cold game, but 5C could easily succeed|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
nt|othered1: This would be a v ery easy Blue Team Club auction, where south would show an ace and a king on his first response, then @H fit, then cue-bidding should focus on t he value of the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @SQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of chances for it though. ace of hearts lead will set it, or spade ace then heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of chances to set i mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: one down or two down ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
nt|geot: Not so many top-tricks here, will have to work well to get 9|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice arrival to proper contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: 5@S-7@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller would reach this surely with their tarzan precision|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N will cash heart ace to get a signal|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2, when S ruff..back @H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like NS play upside down then|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i am surprised that common problem is misunderstood|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: needs to play @d now|pg||
nt|hedyg: will not be in dummy again|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ntmon: with all necessary info delivered by opps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if s still interested N has an easy 7 @H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: well done..|pg||
nt|henryb:  Whatever the bids meant, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while,  Bye for now.|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and play will present no problem with @S 32|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @H 31 is enough already|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or more to the point, @h 3-1|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|bobholl: even with @H 40 there are enough chances|pg||
nt|hedyg: not know about singleton A@D he is thinking 6@c was off right now|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|bobholl: S still can't calculate the @C J :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it's simple calculation: KJx(x) with N or S, A wins with one, Q wins with another- it's equal so far|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|gmarco24: but, with twice finesse you lose to KJ second behind, and there's no way to lose on 2-2 if you cash A|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: always aggravating when they ruff with a stiff trump:(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Bulgaria/trendafilov-karaivanov.pdf|pg||
nt|gmarco24: also, any singleton honor is ok  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: will be relieved later to find out it was making|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|granguru:  using all kind of transfers at the one level in order to force overcaller to lead as much as possible|pg||
nt|danilo1: difficult to believe in this trick|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Indeed!|pg||
nt|danilo1: did it really happen?|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Suppose he's playing safe|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Against @ss 4-1.|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Keeping trump control this way.|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is safe -1 :)|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  -1IMP|pg||

nt|gmarco24: 104 and 105|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have a slight problem with preemptive openers who rebid later. imo when you make a preemptive opening you have bid your hand and let your partner do the bidding from there on|pg||

mb|p|nt|rado: 5@h and 4@s makable now|pg||

nt|rado: same INV fit|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Marko... I don't need of 5 tricks... 4 tricks were enough....|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mathat: very easy to 4 @h for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: whether it is ok to open 7=card preempts at the 2 level is a longstanding controversy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|skjaeran:  On a double finesse and trumps 3-2 more or less.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt not alerted ?|pg||
nt|zebutin: now just to see if they bid it... Qx and Qxx isn't exactly best values for heart game|pg||
nt|blewah: hi everyone|pg||
nt|zebutin: hi Aria|pg||
nt|mathat: with 13 points in jacoby 4 @h bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|rado: and 3@s for NS too:)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: am i talking spanish?  :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: on @C lead also +2 otherwise +1|pg||
nt|henryb:  Palazo is a player after my own style, not opening that dreadful 12 count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 4H also makes without spade lead (or 2 diamonds and spade shift|pg||
nt|rado: mayve 4NT to show 2 suits now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: quick pass :)|pg||
nt|famus: These bg players specially Kalin did v well in Brazil to get BG the bronze--appear to be a bit off color here|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  need more than that|pg||
nt|bobholl: you can subract 1 point for 4333 and one for aceless agree totally|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no way for any different lead i think|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4H can be made even on a S shift after 2 Diamonds |pg||
nt|offthebend: H to 9 forces the Q out -- and then H can be drawn later |pg||
nt|rado: that's almost 100 % for 2nd and 3rd level preempt|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: I may have preferred some number of @c instead of the negative 1@d on the Strong @c opening|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is perhaps less objectionable if playing multi|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it's a play for 4 tricks, you'll lose to KJ second behind|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|psyck:  you have 3 @c's in hand to take care of|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Ruff two of them. You need @Ds to behave too.|pg||
nt|psyck:  and too much work to do as x ruff meands you may not get 2nd @d trick|pg||
nt|danilo1: logical decision by East ... @S shorthness is not encouraging|pg||
nt|psyck: Will likely get to 4@h in due course of time|pg||
nt|blewah: jacoby still on after pass it seems here|pg||
nt|bobholl: not a convincing bidding but it works :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 4-4-3-2 they open 1@H, thus the alert|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|zebutin: this will not take too long|pg||
nt|blewah: 2 @cs abd one @s to loose|pg||
nt|blewah: *and|pg||
pc|c4|nt|offthebend: this has no chance of misdefence -- one down |pg||
pc|cA|nt|skjaeran:  Terrible slam.|pg||
nt|psyck:  don't think it is soo great even w/o trump lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  i wouldn't mind being in it on this lead though|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so maybe @D neg better after all CK|pg||
nt|psyck: the trump break will lead to 2/3 @h losers, nothing much else to lose|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|geot: 4NT was an option, but can easily be wrong|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck: 1@c-3@c-3@h-4@h bidding also possible|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: most likely +1 losing 2 trumps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: IF P has @S suit and hand is a misfit i dont want to show a +ive with a 2@C i what i meant|pg||
nt|famus: run of the mikk boring hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blewah: *lose to be more corrective :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  but KQKQQ is a high card combination many would open|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobholl: now going for the ups|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as so often occurs, a preempt pushes opps into a winning 3N when a quieter auction might have ended in 4M going down in 44 fit|pg||

nt|gmarco24: Zipovski is playing with Koldzic after very long time. they are not standard partners, but both strong Serbian players|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: but i cant help wondering if NS were bidding on same wavelength about majors & with full confidence|pg||

nt|bobholl: 2 imps in the pocket|pg||
nt|henryb:  A sensible hand to pass out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome andy|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that a voluntarily bid game, dbld down 3 was down in both rooms|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Marshall:)|pg||
nt|offthebend: why would N prefer 3NT on the bidding ? South seemed to be quite short in H on the bidding |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N tried to indicate a lack of real enthusiasm for NT by bidding 3H, so thatr if S bid 3S and he then bid 3N it would  be a weak suggestion for NT|pg||
nt|rado: there was a chanse E to open weak 2@H ( they use 5 cards opening) but 2Nd pos and 5332 shape probably stopped him|pg||
nt|rado: now 2@d opening|pg||
nt|rado: but not at red sorry:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: bye CK and all|pg||
nt|psyck: tx Sunil|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it was bid as a save|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: sorry 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: last one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he was trying to let S choose|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sunsamvar: enjoy the rest of the session all|pg||
nt|bobholl: after 1@H double they migth miss 4@S|pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@S for NS, and save in minor for EW?|pg||
nt|bobholl: who should open ? west for the lead ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: make your choice 1 2 3 4 @H or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, white on white...a little unusual but 11 card fits can do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: this is cheaper :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Should E open? I do not think so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, 1@h double a good idea at the vul & with passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the real criterion in such decisions is: if we do push the opps to 5H, are they likely to go down? if not, less attractoive to save, esp with 2 likely defensiove tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder how many pairs have 4@h to play in this situation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, i said that inside it:):(|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i will|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  The shape is awkward. If he was 4-0-5-4 I think there is more of a case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because his hand also makes a ten trick game look a bit distant|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have liked to have at least the H10 before bidding 3NT -- but south though his HQ may help |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: yes...i must admit i couldn't have passed with Wests hand|pg||
nt|rado: 1@C balanced or @C or any FG, 1@D TRF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as it would have if E had held the heart king|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: do you like N's dbl?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: just ask..|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rado: some would overcall 1@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not at all, but sometimes we all make bids we dont like because we have to bid and everything else looks even less appetizing|pg||
nt|offthebend: should N not buid 3D with Qx and wait for S to try 3H or 3S on the way to looking for best spot |pg||
nt|geot: E/W may not get in at all here, and can not be blamed, really?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: 5@H is cheap |pg||
nt|marlowepi: not ao cheap if opps bid 6D|pg||
nt|phil: 1 looks sort of obvious to me even if you play wide ranging preempts|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H goes for 800 so better pass :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that D by N. maybe 4H is better, planning to correct spades to NT for minors|pg||
nt|phil: with a void heart, its unlikely the w/r opponents are bidding 4@h, so maybe the mild overbid of 4N is best? |pg||
nt|phil: *likely|pg||
nt|phil: I think East will get away with 5@h here if he bids it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: inside out|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|skjaeran:  4@h looks like a better contract than 3NT.|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry even 6@H goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|rado: 1@h was quite normal overcall I think|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck:  4@h could make even if you get trumps wrong|pg||
nt|bobholl: only objection against double is only 3 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like any plan that strongly emphasizes the minors, as pd is likely to have a fit. i think the double was based on the fear that S had 18 balanced and that 3N was the only game. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: narrow target to try to hit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= may have longer @ds|pg||
pc|c4|nt|skjaeran:  Can discard a spade on clubs.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 3@D would be forcing, ! would choose 3@D rather than jump to 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  right lead found|pg||
nt|offthebend: I never double with that hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: many perhaps wondering why S did not raise diamonds. the answer must be that NS play "equal level conversion"|pg||
nt|rado: good shape, quick tricks...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: same results in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: same play|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yeah|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: u r faster|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but only with weak NT hands 11-14 points|pg||
nt|rado: Majors breaking good for Declarer but minors not so..|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a very succesful lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h must have shown an intermediate hand with 5@h & W was not interested in game opp less than strong @c opening values|pg||
nt|zebutin: and some might even bid with Easts hand something like balancing 1nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT easier to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: friendly major suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: I can understand E not bidding as he expects vul opps to be in a misfit as pd did not x 1@h|pg||
nt|gmarco24: rare to see the first level competition  :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gluckenval: not so easy this 3@H.... |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: it is a intresting overcall :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: dont u think?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|geot: E/W has a nice heart contract. Third board in a row a heart fit is not found, and no-one has really done anything silly |pg||
nt|geot: yes, Rado...a 1H overcall would have worked nicely|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rado: 4@s has good chances restricting losers to trump and 2@h|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck:  transfer to maj & bidding minor is gf for most|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|psyck: so asystemic gain for Slovakia|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim button|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@D and Q@D now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb:  Although I think it is scary to volunteer a three card suit, Muranli did well to steer partner to a @s lead|pg||
nt|rado: and 5@D also makable|pg||
nt|gluckenval: well, I would bid the same... some time my p when bid 2@H has really 5+ cards :)|pg||
nt|rado: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|famus: this might become interesting --declarer has a 9th trk problen|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but a few players will bid 2@H overcall|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@H much better contract than 3NT |pg||
nt|psyck: *E was not...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i vote for @s now, but he might play 3 rounds of @d|pg||
nt|ntmon: there is no legitimate way to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|geot: but only four card suit, and red ag green....|pg||
nt|gluckenval: having an easy dbl as alternative...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: as kit woolsey has repeatedly emphasized, we shouldnt automatically shy away from a takeout double when there is just one reply that will make us unhappy -- why assume partner will ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: always make that bid. most hands are about fits, and the opps dont have a heart fit probably so maybe their fit is in clubs and a double will find our fit for us|pg||

nt|frangos007:  Cyprus not having the best of games unfortunately|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: 4@S migth go down :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of pressure on E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes you have to stick it out there|pg||
nt|frangos007:  won many part-score baords but lost 1-2 boards almost every match badly|pg||

mb|1N|nt|zebutin: they just love their hearts in this match|pg||

nt|marlowepi: but if you do, faster is better|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: or 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: what do u prefer|pg||
nt|alnanda: ......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a 3D opening by W (not that i recommend it) would almost surely briung a huge reward on this deal|pg||
nt|rado: Seniors will bid 2 I think:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: do we know how many countries participating in this event?|pg||
nt|bobholl: with this @C position 3nt no problem too :)|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
nt|andyv:  you don't get dealt that good of @s suit to pass in these situations|pg||
nt|frangos007:  2@H by S very risk at this vuln imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: nice R:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  but you were right, Marshall....the vul got to E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i just bid in these situations, despite the dangers, and somehow it rarely works out disastrously. often it is -100 vs +50 but that is a fleabite|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but with some serious thinking..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: long i mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D is perhaps not available to them as a natural preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  now trying to recover - this might be costly|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphznq: on TGRs behalf I'd like to thank... ROLAND (for being helpful and supporting)@H@H@H... ALL COMMENTATORS (for making this event more interesting)@H@H@H Thank you all for your time ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
nt|danilo1: East hand on limit to make slam try in @C ... and West's one on limit to accept it ... together - slam danger |pg||
nt|granguru:  3@D is a slam invitation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has a whopper of a 1N bid. 2C worth considering as alternative|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has a nasty guess between the majors but he gambled rigth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NV i would endorse 3D|pg||
nt|ntmon: what are the standards for vul overcall at 2nd level and passed partner?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: if 3@D is transfer  worth 4@H ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N with good @h support and no @c stopper|pg||
nt|rado: 11 tricks for NS , unless EW cash theyr @D |pg||
nt|gluckenval: looking at the board, how many pass/1@S from South ? |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  4@s is a sensible contract, just needing the @hA onside. It isn't.|pg||
nt|bobholl: both bidding strange but 3nt is only makeable game bridge is a funny game :)|pg||
nt|frangos007:  looks like a routine -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|gmarco24: good layout for a slam, but from E's hand|pg||

nt|hedyg: in the mean imps pouring in for Vito from the open room|pg||
pc|cK|nt|granguru:  thats why W is considering ..|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H positive response|pg||
nt|granguru:  probably in 1 minor|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  EW is not a regular partnership. Hope they know what they're doing now.|pg||
nt|granguru:  not known|pg||
nt|psyck:  Other room E knew pd had 4 carder @h with likely some wastage, after kickback revealed an ace missing, maybe should stop in game with min hand|pg||
nt|offthebend: pretty timid bidding all around :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: overtricks coming.... may be too many overtricks. This auction from South indicate a minimum hand, but with North spot I probably reopen the bid. 7 controls are often enough for a ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: slam, with a std opening bid from the partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: what do u think abt opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, agree with u|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: 3@d may have just been a 2nd relay, G|pg||
nt|frangos007:  -1 now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|blewah: i think just relay|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ntmon: the final contract is the consequence of the overcall |pg||
pc|s3|nt|mathat: after A @s play @h and finesse @c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru:  4@c looks agrees trump|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|gluckenval: I would pass.... 1) vulnerable, 2) I can give the hand with a ghestem later, 3) I'm a rabbit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hedy did you agree abt 12 tricks?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  This should be 12 imps to Luxenbourg, which will essentially tie the match|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has to lead a @C in time but i guess he will |pg||
nt|henryb:  BTW, is there a website for standings?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|granguru:  4@H no @d control|pg||
nt|granguru:  only a @d lead permits to win|pg||
nt|psyck:  i've no idea what the bids mean here, but looks like they knew what they meant to do|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: all event details can be found here: www.tgrsbridge.com|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: there is i guess but don't know whre|pg||
pc|dK|nt|zebutin: now little easier, but if they drive @S A down, you must feel little uneasy that @C finese isn't actually working|pg||
nt|zebutin: even if it works for the 1st time you take it that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: where|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might try to find @CJ with west|pg||
nt|rado: yes if W starts with DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4) r u not 5) good point 6) i like it :) 7) may be next time will not open with those kind of shapes :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: lol :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :):)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|granguru:  made!|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure if they had this option (lot of partnerships use it) - but if possible, better would be to transfer in @C and show slam try with @H single/void ... West would than ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably not accept|pg||
nt|frangos007:  to limit to -1|pg||
nt|famus: game|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: i always agree with the operator|pg||

nt|phil: yes, KQTxx is more than 5 'beans'|pg||
nt|frangos007:  @D7 is high, but not point in trying to play loser on loser|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|phil: but 2N looks hungry too|pg||
nt|geot: it is 11 tricks....or not so many at all on this one. Partscore is normal|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 3Dmaking is likely outcome|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the trick is to stay only in 4@S|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia has taken an early lead here|pg||
nt|rado: slam in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: luckily not possible to misguess @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW bid to 4@s, I think it's a good chance NS will go to 5@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s as in lebensohl showing 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|chrisky: 6NT also....|pg||
nt|blewah: exclusion rkcb now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@D voidwood would be pretty now |pg||
nt|blewah: 5@d|pg||
nt|blewah: or yes 4@d, depending on their agreement|pg||
nt|bobholl: why 1 @S 3rd hand a multi or weak two looks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 1H ? why not X ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not my call but might find the 4-4 fit for whatever value it has here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless that shows 64 in S/H respectively, it seems eccentric|pg||
nt|rado: here 1@C is 15+ bal or @C or any FG|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 1st swing at board 4... great 4@S for Isreal, vs a perfect 3NT (6@C +3 Aces)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bobholl: 4@H no aces and the optimum contract in the best hand :)|pg||
nt|rado: mean grand at 52 cards but probably 6@S will see|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: 2@h is normal, slower road|pg||
nt|bobholl: although this migth work out better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@C now may be|pg||
nt|offthebend: strong C auction -- is this 2NT forcing by Hristov ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and is GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it should be|pg||
nt|geot: 15+9 HCPs. With some good guessing game is possible|pg||
nt|rado: 1NT is bal FG or some other options|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|frangos007:  South asking for trouble |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H is on|pg||
nt|hedyg: even after a @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznq: on TGRs behalf I'd like to thank... ROLAND (for being helpful and supporting)@H@H@H... ALL COMMENTATORS (for making this event more interesting)@H@H@H Thank you all for your time ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: anyone for 2@C NV vs. voul |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 in hand is the threat but in that case Nwould have played @SK to kill the squeeze|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not me|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: now double in N ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't understand either|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract, however, is normal enough|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4NT is for the minors, which after the takeout double usually promising 4@H, shows a void in spades|pg||
nt|ugis: probably N could have bid smth over 3c..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: was alerted like GF|pg||
nt|rado: 4@D will make the things easy now|pg||
nt|offthebend: why not 2NT over 2H -- to show balanced GF and H stopper ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hristov explain that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps a multi-way bid, including a lebensohl variant|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: NS playing Precision club|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ntmon: we can see endless aggressivity with poor outcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: and s 3@S now ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  N might double this, expecting strength from partner|pg||
nt|frangos007:  there you go :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  what, I wonder, is 3@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: strong :):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but the colour...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Where I come from it shows a solid suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  not AJxxxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: best lead, removing the ruffs of the red suits in dummy|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|henryb:  Whatever, but I think Ulugol owed his partner 5@h, not 4 with the good trump support|pg||
nt|offthebend: correct |pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably because it wouldnt mean that|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they havent really unearthed much of a fit yet, so i think 5H would be a bit of an exaggeration|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@D likes @Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: with 2nt he denide 5 colour suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am wondering why N passed over 1C:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes of course, but couldnt E bid 4D with a hand that was not as good as this one as dummy for spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and show balancing hand|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: showing*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: salut henri:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hey Hendry|pg||
nt|offthebend: Hi Henri |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Henry|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|rado: 2@C showed bal hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sry misclicked|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: bid your best minor i will support you then |pg||
nt|frangos007:  this should make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i guess he tried to deny 4@h with 3@s, dbl is maybe with 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: uf|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: henri|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting now..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: may be Tanev dont understand 2nt |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: like strong hand (positive)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, when i said that 5H might be a bit too much, i certainly didnt mean that the alternative was a mere 4S|pg||
mb|4C|an| |mb|p|nt|henryb:  2N, in my world, says two places to play|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am quite sure that there is a mild confusion here -- W thinks 2NT is limited |pg||
nt|geot: 4@S is the contract ...if you want to be in game|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@S..|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: me and my partner would have done not that good on this one 1nt 2@C and than 4@H :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even so, why not 4H?|pg||
nt|ritong: by east|pg||
nt|ritong: establishing @ss for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could E have: Txx   JTxx  AQx   QJx ?|pg||
nt|offthebend: if 2NT is limited with some H stopper and D A -- he needs too much to look for a slam |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i think E should realized , his p dont understand 2nt like a positive.. and try to bid something else then PASS|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||
nt|rado: probably some sort of Lebensohl situation cue= denies|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i doubt, since then 3@s would promise 4@h. weird, i don't know really|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Zipovski is well known as "i play 2 conventions partner!" when he plays with unknown partner|pg||
nt|henryb:  RKC - 1KC, |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, i hope so|pg||
nt|henryb:  Do you have the @hQ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see now the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: The trumps works fine, but he needs to guess the club situation|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: may be i direct 4/5 @D would agree @S :(|pg||
nt|henryb:  I assume 2@d showed some values and 2@h would have been an immediate double negative|pg||
nt|ritong: hum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on what grounds could E recognize that?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|blewah: yes, that would be the intention too|pg||
nt|frangos007:  going for the possible overtrick?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  trying to discard losing club if @HA is with North, perhaps|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i think the bidding makes clear the @SK is with N and he should have tackled trumps immediately|pg||
nt|frangos007:  it's all down to getting the trumps right|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ugis: only diamond ruffs beat 4 spades|pg||
nt|geot: @C switch now?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming that part has not understood a bid looks unhealthy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|blewah: W just wanted to knoe keycards in @s excluding in @d|pg||
nt|frangos007:  this might help declarer now to make +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Q+K@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but i dont see the queen :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ulugol may have assumed thaat the third heart was the equivalent of the Q opposite partner's 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i guess..|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am betting on 510 though :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|blewah: *know|pg||
nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer should lead the @hJ next|pg||
nt|frangos007:  playing @D for him|pg||
nt|henryb:  I sure would, although I would have been wondering what partner's suit was for 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: me 2.. may be he is thinking abt AJ10xxxx..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 7th|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: but his @d spots are so good he doesnt need to ruff any|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzre: 3@h IS a serious bid..|pg||
nt|henryb:  can declarer afford to safety play hearts?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|geot: diamond back was as good|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  N should play @h toward the Q|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he will give 2@ds and 2@hs and be -2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frangos007:  wd|pg||
nt|frangos007:  now +1|pg||
nt|geot: ruff now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  Well done!|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  that is cash the A, then lead towards dummy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: not enough.. :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  W is known to have the K@h|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|offthebend: yayyyyy|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzre: now easy|pg||
nt|ntmon: no swing|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d6|nt|gmarco24: Karaivanov is killing declarer with "always @s" return whenever he is in trick|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  A few IMPs for de Botton on the last board. Congrats to the winners: Esterson|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c6|nt|bobholl: has to guess @C for 2@H making :)|pg||
nt|phil: has good count now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|geot: nice defence. The contract would have had better chances played by W|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Bye all|pg||
pc|c8|nt|danilo1: thanks all|pg||
nt|rado: Long trump plays long suit nice rule in defence:)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D much much better|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  The 1@s opening worked much better than 2@d at the other table|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@s|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|vugraphznq: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: see you next time, bye|pg||
