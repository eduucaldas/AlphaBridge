nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: easy 4@H to start with |pg||
nt|othered1: A routine strong NT auction, perhaps, but today 4th seat 1N openers are relatively rare,  as someone finds a reason to open in front of them|pg||
nt|bobholl: p p p  1nt  p 2@D superaccept 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rado: hi all, welcome to round 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hey Rado,welcome :)|pg||
nt|rado: NS play precizion with 1NT showing @D suit as far as we meet last time in StZ|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone, this is the last round for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello every one|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: everyone|pg||
nt|rado: welcome to the final round|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: this is the last round|pg||
nt|rado: facing 1st and 2nd team so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: Israel leading by 21 vp's so they need 4 or 5 to won the event|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Dessy|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bobholl: good ed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: And south gets a psychic 1@D in.  Wonder if they play Precision style, where a 3rd seat 1@D psyche is almost free|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rado: and 1@D showing weak NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome all to Stara Zagora:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentator (alone so far) is Rado|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|rado: NS use precision with many scientific gadgets:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 2@S looks to be showing a @D fit as well as @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|rado: 10 teams, round robin 12 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hello Marshal|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome to you to|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: wonder what 2N was for them|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently a raise of some kind looking at the 4@s rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Can west be t hinking?  Partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: zdr dessy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rado: info at:http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|rado: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far a very standard auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello :) to you too.. welcome|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H not showing length, as N is known to have a strong hand but did not reverse to 2@H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: this will be a very routine 5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: the results http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|rado: first blood now , |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has already implied 5 spades but wishes to emphasize the suit due to its quality, and is not crazy about NT with no fit and some potential red- suit problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yeah:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good presume|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: going for some xruff maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: that may not work well if he loses 2@s, 1@h, 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, his best chance would be to get @d fin right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks to be a dull 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: simple 3 nt with 9 (or 10) tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|danilo1: 8 topp tricks ... but guess any lead by West will find ninth one (difficult to immagine @C lead)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: after 3S, though, the auction sort of petered out. both players have enough to try for slam. N despite the highcard minimum has a super hand with controls and a great suit and his ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: small doubleton in exactly the right place. S has 3 controls and a possible trick source and a potentially useful nine of clubs|pg||
nt|rado: Israel needs calm boards and Vito - wild ones:)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|skjaeran:  Still onluy 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  *only|pg||
nt|danilo1: y|pg||
nt|psyck:  2 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome R@H|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not made (yet)|pg||
nt|psyck: not a great game with only 1 entry to dummy & not enough tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@H now is best|pg||
nt|psyck: would often go down even with @h fin on, & no chance here|pg||
nt|rado: 3@S makable and 3@H down one|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen really hit the best lead.|pg||
nt|psyck:  6 feet 9 inches|pg||
nt|psyck:  9.5|pg||
nt|granguru:  skov6.791338|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. since North shown 4-card @H ... not easy lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And good evening to GeO Tislevoll in New Zealand|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Going down now.|pg||
nt|geot: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello welcome|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rado: 1st board nothing unusuall|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|psyck:  That was Skov's height, 6' 9,5"...|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Yes, he's a BIG guy.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|dK|nt|danilo1: starting with @C is strange play .. if 3-3, no need to hurry|pg||
nt|psyck: if it not a bad game either, with several chances|pg||
nt|rado: players do not see all 52 cards for down 2 like us|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to  Seppo|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru:  6f 9.48i|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  He could have made it by playing @DA @D after two clubs.|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad prediction 11 tricks |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bidding at the 3 level was -- and is almost never -- about slam, but rather about game exploration. so it would not have been at all redundant for NS to continue via 4C-4D-4H ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 3S, or for N to  cue  a red suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|zebutin: good day everyone|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d5|nt|danilo1: y|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am afraid we might be losing connection also |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|psyck: including misdef, there was no cause to duck the @h|pg||
nt|bobholl: now made :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: a regular partnership should know what 4C means in this sequence. there are several useful possibilities.  |pg||

nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently he did try the x ruff & went down as suspected|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on 6@H good save|pg||
nt|bobholl: and a likely push|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of room for differing actions on this  hand, beginning with east's possible opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of options for the auction here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam is of course very playable on the NS cards, and possibly makeable via a squeeze (or pseudo)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzre: that what i see is ..auto squeeze :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: mighty try even 7@D|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone know their 1N range?|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: the correct side will start bidding @d soon :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like their  headed to a @S fit|pg||
nt|geot: super fit here for E/W. can make all the tricks in a @H contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see the contract :)|pg||
nt|rado: 2NT is INV only with fit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
nt|rado: 11 tricks in @S double dummy|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
nt|gluckenval: hi all and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hi there, welcome|pg||
nt|gluckenval: zdr Dessy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: seems NS use natural methods, not precision sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a colossally strong hand for a multi in most partnerships, even red|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting opening here|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but.. :) good contract |pg||
pc|s6|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/  updated after round 6. Israel in a very strong position|pg||
pc|s7|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Team Members http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/teams.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|rado: 5 or 7 hand depending on K@D:)|pg||
nt|geot: In slam - on a club lead, it is on the @D finesse|pg||
pc|s8|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||
nt|rado: trump lead is good for defence but declarer still home with 3@C ruffs|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Subhash Gupta|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|h3|nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|c7|nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|psyck: lead was easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: NV, may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|offthebend: hello everybody|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow not best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ running scores|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sorry crazy mouse :)|pg||
nt|rado: pessimistic approach by W , many would splinter 3@S |pg||
nt|geot: yes, so might as well be in 7 rather than 6, or just game|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|c8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are many situations like this in fourth seat where you want to open but are afraid of being outbid so you open with a preempt which  in last seat is of course not weak. here ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: however that is a questionable strategy, because 2D probably wont keep them out of spades if they have them. meanwhile partner could be something like 4153 and you end in hearts ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps down with  110 or 130 to make in diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi there:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Congrats Marshall!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some sort of record?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You just set a new BBO record: 5 lines of commentary|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good point :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hihi|pg||
nt|offthebend: is that really a record :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only because the chatspace is so narrow:)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||
nt|othered1: best defense likely would have started by south leading the long suit |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hi welcome|pg||
nt|gluckenval: correct play in @H... really unlucky for declarer.... but it happens... (25% of times, more or less :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: this is not the best play in @h, slight better is A@h, @h to Q, since you can lose 2 tricks on KJ behind if you play finesse twice|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|granguru:  claim time already|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: not sure about this line, as opposed to setting up a diamond, but with right view in hearts D wont be needed|pg||
nt|bobholl: n can't guess the 4@H in e :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: results|pg||
nt|offthebend: W has to duck this to hold it to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|nt|psyck: Even with @d fin, @s will never produce trick, so may as ewll have discarded @d on @sA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|granguru:  making 11 now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|offthebend: who is taking so long ?|pg||

nt|phil: yes, declarer gets a good count on the hand when the 3rd diamond is played. I do think its stronger for North to duck that heart though, don;t you think? |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sunsamvar: BRAVE 1 NT BY e|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but it will make nevertheless|pg||
nt|geot: 3NT seems normal on this one|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sunsamvar: P cud be yarborough|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: the results after round 3 3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some like sandwich NT (for other suits) & some like nat NT (since opps often open & respond light & steal you blind)...|pg||
nt|othered1: 7 is an excellent spot and may be biddable.  |pg||
nt|rado: W might use garbage stayman here |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: so many traps in here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: 3N by W looks good as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland has the 'R' convention closely trailing the F & G conventions in the list of avoidable ones|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt x on a @S  lead :) wouldn't have found that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: for the results|pg||
nt|offthebend: only makeable game is 3NT by West -- hard to get there |pg||
nt|rado: and probably will end in 3NT by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: @S guess solved now so will make|pg||
nt|phil: me neither :)|pg||
nt|phil: but even on a heart, there arent a lot of tricks|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sunsamvar: 2@S transfer and 2nt acceptance|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no 3nt |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: true CK but still a brave bid at unfav vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: playing NT as nat in that position, I would also bid 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all, sorry i am late:):(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S had not an obvious pass for some of us|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes a 53 major suit fit is not the key to the city. here 5C is a much more comfortable spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy it looks like W can get home, but there is work to be done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as the cards lie, even 6C is more comfortable than 4S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has every reason to think long and carefully here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though soon we may start wondering if the screen door has been raised:)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Marko, I think this could help you : http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_4.htm|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: on their way to 7 i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3N by W is only cold game, but 5C could easily succeed|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5C can be beaten only on S ruff now |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  I play 1@s by E as 4+ cards & x with less|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now making as crucial entry got|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and this is not that hard..|pg||
nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: good morning to everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
nt|othered1: This would be a v ery easy Blue Team Club auction, where south would show an ace and a king on his first response, then @H fit, then cue-bidding should focus on t he value of the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @SQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of chances for it though. ace of hearts lead will set it, or spade ace then heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of chances to set i mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: one down or two down ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one|pg||
pc|d3|nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
nt|geot: Not so many top-tricks here, will have to work well to get 9|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice arrival to proper contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: 5@S-7@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller would reach this surely with their tarzan precision|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: N will cash heart ace to get a signal|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2, when S ruff..back @H|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like NS play upside down then|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i am surprised that common problem is misunderstood|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: needs to play @d now|pg||
nt|hedyg: will not be in dummy again|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ntmon: with all necessary info delivered by opps|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if s still interested N has an easy 7 @H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: well done..|pg||
nt|henryb:  Whatever the bids meant, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while,  Bye for now.|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and play will present no problem with @S 32|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @H 31 is enough already|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or more to the point, @h 3-1|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: even with @H 40 there are enough chances|pg||
nt|hedyg: not know about singleton A@D he is thinking 6@c was off right now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s7|nt|bobholl: S still can't calculate the @C J :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it's simple calculation: KJx(x) with N or S, A wins with one, Q wins with another- it's equal so far|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gmarco24: but, with twice finesse you lose to KJ second behind, and there's no way to lose on 2-2 if you cash A|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: always aggravating when they ruff with a stiff trump:(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Bulgaria/trendafilov-karaivanov.pdf|pg||
nt|gmarco24: also, any singleton honor is ok  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: will be relieved later to find out it was making|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|granguru:  using all kind of transfers at the one level in order to force overcaller to lead as much as possible|pg||
nt|danilo1: difficult to believe in this trick|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Indeed!|pg||
nt|danilo1: did it really happen?|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Suppose he's playing safe|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Against @ss 4-1.|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Keeping trump control this way.|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is safe -1 :)|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  -1IMP|pg||
nt|danilo1: srry,. @D are high ... |pg||

mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: whether it is ok to open 7=card preempts at the 2 level is a longstanding controversy|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||

nt|gmarco24: am i talking spanish?  :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bobholl: on @C lead also +2 otherwise +1|pg||
nt|henryb:  Palazo is a player after my own style, not opening that dreadful 12 count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 4H also makes without spade lead (or 2 diamonds and spade shift|pg||
nt|rado: mayve 4NT to show 2 suits now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: quick pass :)|pg||
nt|famus: These bg players specially Kalin did v well in Brazil to get BG the bronze--appear to be a bit off color here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|psyck:  need more than that|pg||
nt|bobholl: you can subract 1 point for 4333 and one for aceless agree totally|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no way for any different lead i think|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4H can be made even on a S shift after 2 Diamonds |pg||
nt|offthebend: H to 9 forces the Q out -- and then H can be drawn later |pg||
nt|rado: that's almost 100 % for 2nd and 3rd level preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I may have preferred some number of @c instead of the negative 1@d on the Strong @c opening|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is perhaps less objectionable if playing multi|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it's a play for 4 tricks, you'll lose to KJ second behind|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck:  you have 3 @c's in hand to take care of|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Ruff two of them. You need @Ds to behave too.|pg||
nt|psyck:  and too much work to do as x ruff meands you may not get 2nd @d trick|pg||
nt|danilo1: logical decision by East ... @S shorthness is not encouraging|pg||
nt|psyck: Will likely get to 4@h in due course of time|pg||
nt|blewah: jacoby still on after pass it seems here|pg||
nt|bobholl: not a convincing bidding but it works :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 4-4-3-2 they open 1@H, thus the alert|pg||
pc|s9|nt|zebutin: this will not take too long|pg||
nt|blewah: 2 @cs abd one @s to loose|pg||
nt|blewah: *and|pg||
pc|s4|nt|offthebend: this has no chance of misdefence -- one down |pg||
pc|s6|nt|skjaeran:  Terrible slam.|pg||
nt|psyck:  don't think it is soo great even w/o trump lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  i wouldn't mind being in it on this lead though|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so maybe @D neg better after all CK|pg||
nt|psyck: the trump break will lead to 2/3 @h losers, nothing much else to lose|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|geot: 4NT was an option, but can easily be wrong|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: 1@c-3@c-3@h-4@h bidding also possible|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: most likely +1 losing 2 trumps|pg||

mc|13|nt|bobholl: now going for the ups|pg||

nt|rado: Aronov-Stefanov & Mihov- Nanev|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Bulgaria was excellent last year, or 2 years ago, can't remember|pg||
nt|rado: good lead for defence|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Mihov-Nanev? not Nanev-Gunev?|pg||
nt|rado: last BB in Brasil 3rd place|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: you only gain from QTx or QTxx in one of the two hands, or Tx in S, which i think is also 12 cases, pretty even|pg||
pc|sK|nt|granguru:  but we usual mortals must suffer the defeat|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this shd be interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ resutls|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|offthebend: this is going down vey fast on a natural H lead |pg||

nt|famus: 3@ds was making--so have to figure out how much this wud set|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: 12/11 favoring the drop i think|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|henryb:  If they can keep everything straight, N-S have 5 defensive tricks. Since they have 5 losers (maybe) in a spade contract, this is essentially "par"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|geot: he will drop the Q now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|nt|bobholl: he hasn't got his 10'th trick but @C A well positioned|pg||
nt|phil: yes, unlikely partner is underleading AKxx on this auction|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|psyck:  Ideal deal to defend for those who forget the bidding once it is over|pg||
nt|psyck:  or those who pick the card nearest to thump to lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards it's so easy : 2@D and a @S :)|pg||
nt|phil: now East is in grave danger of getting endplayed|pg||
nt|gmarco24: "school" lead with good holding in first suit(@H)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|blewah: right Khrisna, interesting isn't it?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sunsamvar: nice start by declaer|pg||

nt|bobholl: 2 imps in the pocket|pg||
nt|henryb:  A sensible hand to pass out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome andy|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that a voluntarily bid game, dbld down 3 was down in both rooms|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Marshall:)|pg||
nt|offthebend: why would N prefer 3NT on the bidding ? South seemed to be quite short in H on the bidding |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N tried to indicate a lack of real enthusiasm for NT by bidding 3H, so thatr if S bid 3S and he then bid 3N it would  be a weak suggestion for NT|pg||
nt|rado: there was a chanse E to open weak 2@H ( they use 5 cards opening) but 2Nd pos and 5332 shape probably stopped him|pg||
nt|rado: now 2@d opening|pg||
nt|rado: but not at red sorry:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: bye CK and all|pg||
nt|psyck: tx Sunil|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it was bid as a save|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: sorry 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: last one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he was trying to let S choose|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: enjoy the rest of the session all|pg||
nt|bobholl: after 1@H double they migth miss 4@S|pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@S for NS, and save in minor for EW?|pg||
nt|bobholl: who should open ? west for the lead ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: make your choice 1 2 3 4 @H or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, white on white...a little unusual but 11 card fits can do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: this is cheaper :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Should E open? I do not think so.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psyck: yes, 1@h double a good idea at the vul & with passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the real criterion in such decisions is: if we do push the opps to 5H, are they likely to go down? if not, less attractoive to save, esp with 2 likely defensiove tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder how many pairs have 4@h to play in this situation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, i said that inside it:):(|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i will|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  The shape is awkward. If he was 4-0-5-4 I think there is more of a case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because his hand also makes a ten trick game look a bit distant|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have liked to have at least the H10 before bidding 3NT -- but south though his HQ may help |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: yes...i must admit i couldn't have passed with Wests hand|pg||
nt|rado: 1@C balanced or @C or any FG, 1@D TRF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as it would have if E had held the heart king|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: do you like N's dbl?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: just ask..|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rado: some would overcall 1@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not at all, but sometimes we all make bids we dont like because we have to bid and everything else looks even less appetizing|pg||
nt|offthebend: should N not buid 3D with Qx and wait for S to try 3H or 3S on the way to looking for best spot |pg||
nt|geot: E/W may not get in at all here, and can not be blamed, really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 5@H is cheap |pg||
nt|marlowepi: not ao cheap if opps bid 6D|pg||
nt|phil: 1 looks sort of obvious to me even if you play wide ranging preempts|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H goes for 800 so better pass :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that D by N. maybe 4H is better, planning to correct spades to NT for minors|pg||
nt|phil: with a void heart, its unlikely the w/r opponents are bidding 4@h, so maybe the mild overbid of 4N is best? |pg||
nt|phil: *likely|pg||
nt|phil: I think East will get away with 5@h here if he bids it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: inside out|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  4@h looks like a better contract than 3NT.|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry even 6@H goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|rado: 1@h was quite normal overcall I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  4@h could make even if you get trumps wrong|pg||
nt|bobholl: only objection against double is only 3 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like any plan that strongly emphasizes the minors, as pd is likely to have a fit. i think the double was based on the fear that S had 18 balanced and that 3N was the only game. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: narrow target to try to hit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= may have longer @ds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|skjaeran:  Can discard a spade on clubs.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 3@D would be forcing, ! would choose 3@D rather than jump to 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  right lead found|pg||
nt|offthebend: I never double with that hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: many perhaps wondering why S did not raise diamonds. the answer must be that NS play "equal level conversion"|pg||
nt|rado: good shape, quick tricks...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: same results in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: same play|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yeah|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: u r faster|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but only with weak NT hands 11-14 points|pg||
nt|rado: Majors breaking good for Declarer but minors not so..|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a very succesful lead|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h must have shown an intermediate hand with 5@h & W was not interested in game opp less than strong @c opening values|pg||
nt|zebutin: and some might even bid with Easts hand something like balancing 1nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT easier to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: friendly major suits|pg||

pc|c3|nt|psyck: I can understand E not bidding as he expects vul opps to be in a misfit as pd did not x 1@h|pg||
nt|gmarco24: rare to see the first level competition  :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gluckenval: not so easy this 3@H.... |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: it is a intresting overcall :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: dont u think?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|geot: E/W has a nice heart contract. Third board in a row a heart fit is not found, and no-one has really done anything silly |pg||
nt|geot: yes, Rado...a 1H overcall would have worked nicely|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rado: 4@s has good chances restricting losers to trump and 2@h|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck:  transfer to maj & bidding minor is gf for most|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|psyck: so asystemic gain for Slovakia|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim button|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@D and Q@D now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  Although I think it is scary to volunteer a three card suit, Muranli did well to steer partner to a @s lead|pg||
nt|rado: and 5@D also makable|pg||
nt|gluckenval: well, I would bid the same... some time my p when bid 2@H has really 5+ cards :)|pg||
nt|rado: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|famus: this might become interesting --declarer has a 9th trk problen|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but a few players will bid 2@H overcall|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@H much better contract than 3NT |pg||
nt|psyck: *E was not...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i vote for @s now, but he might play 3 rounds of @d|pg||
nt|ntmon: there is no legitimate way to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|geot: but only four card suit, and red ag green....|pg||
nt|gluckenval: having an easy dbl as alternative...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: as kit woolsey has repeatedly emphasized, we shouldnt automatically shy away from a takeout double when there is just one reply that will make us unhappy -- why assume partner will ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: always make that bid. most hands are about fits, and the opps dont have a heart fit probably so maybe their fit is in clubs and a double will find our fit for us|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: what do u prefer|pg||
nt|alnanda: ......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a 3D opening by W (not that i recommend it) would almost surely briung a huge reward on this deal|pg||

nt|andyv:  you don't get dealt that good of @s suit to pass in these situations|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: nice R:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  but you were right, Marshall....the vul got to E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i just bid in these situations, despite the dangers, and somehow it rarely works out disastrously. often it is -100 vs +50 but that is a fleabite|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but with some serious thinking..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: long i mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D is perhaps not available to them as a natural preempt|pg||

nt|danilo1: East hand on limit to make slam try in @C ... and West's one on limit to accept it ... together - slam danger |pg||
nt|granguru:  3@D is a slam invitation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has a whopper of a 1N bid. 2C worth considering as alternative|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has a nasty guess between the majors but he gambled rigth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NV i would endorse 3D|pg||
nt|ntmon: what are the standards for vul overcall at 2nd level and passed partner?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: if 3@D is transfer  worth 4@H ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N with good @h support and no @c stopper|pg||
nt|rado: 11 tricks for NS , unless EW cash theyr @D |pg||
nt|gluckenval: looking at the board, how many pass/1@S from South ? |pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  4@s is a sensible contract, just needing the @hA onside. It isn't.|pg||
nt|bobholl: both bidding strange but 3nt is only makeable game bridge is a funny game :)|pg||

mb|3H|nt|granguru:  thats why W is considering ..|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H positive response|pg||
nt|granguru:  probably in 1 minor|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  EW is not a regular partnership. Hope they know what they're doing now.|pg||
nt|granguru:  not known|pg||
nt|psyck:  Other room E knew pd had 4 carder @h with likely some wastage, after kickback revealed an ace missing, maybe should stop in game with min hand|pg||
nt|offthebend: pretty timid bidding all around :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: overtricks coming.... may be too many overtricks. This auction from South indicate a minimum hand, but with North spot I probably reopen the bid. 7 controls are often enough for a ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: slam, with a std opening bid from the partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: what do u think abt opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, agree with u|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d may have just been a 2nd relay, G|pg||
nt|frangos007:  -1 now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|blewah: i think just relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ntmon: the final contract is the consequence of the overcall |pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: after A @s play @h and finesse @c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru:  4@c looks agrees trump|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gluckenval: I would pass.... 1) vulnerable, 2) I can give the hand with a ghestem later, 3) I'm a rabbit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hedy did you agree abt 12 tricks?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  This should be 12 imps to Luxenbourg, which will essentially tie the match|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has to lead a @C in time but i guess he will |pg||
nt|henryb:  BTW, is there a website for standings?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|granguru:  4@H no @d control|pg||
nt|granguru:  only a @d lead permits to win|pg||

nt|bobholl: where|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might try to find @CJ with west|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: 4) r u not 5) good point 6) i like it :) 7) may be next time will not open with those kind of shapes :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: lol :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :):)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|granguru:  made!|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure if they had this option (lot of partnerships use it) - but if possible, better would be to transfer in @C and show slam try with @H single/void ... West would than ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably not accept|pg||
nt|frangos007:  to limit to -1|pg||
nt|famus: game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: i always agree with the operator|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: S leads the 9 to feign a singleton, but with only 2 in dummy W is not likely to panic. here of course it  didntmatter|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||

pc|s3|nt|granguru:  no still another loser|pg||
nt|phil: yes, KQTxx is more than 5 'beans'|pg||
nt|frangos007:  @D7 is high, but not point in trying to play loser on loser|pg||
pc|s4|nt|phil: but 2N looks hungry too|pg||
nt|geot: it is 11 tricks....or not so many at all on this one. Partscore is normal|pg||
pc|sA|nt|famus: -2|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|psyck: he could fall back on @d ruffs if they do not play trump|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: again, S has automatically assumed that the hand is a misfit, i.e. that N secondary length is in diamonds. but why not find out? maybe he has a black suit|pg||
pc|hT|nt|granguru:  needs HA on S|pg||
nt|danilo1: even !@D lead not enough|pg||
nt|psyck:  thanks all|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|granguru:  needed @HA well placed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ntmon: with friendly break :) of trump suit|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|frangos007:  so, -2 and lucky to have escaped the double|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|frangos007:  trying to pin @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good point but..:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: S should have led a low club toward the queen, in case W had club king. if queen loses to king there is still time and entries to take the ruffing D finesse against W|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: but nothing wrong with asking|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frangos007:  hand over|pg||

nt|blewah: slam time|pg||
nt|bobholl: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/  thanks from a kibitzer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but club toward dummy is an extra chance at no cost|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems to be the normal thing to do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should be a big pickup as EW make 4S|pg||
nt|frangos007:  another very interesting hand|pg||
nt|ugis: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|psyck: NS will go down in some contract here i suppose|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless you have 2 timid rabbits sitting E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: auction might not go the same early|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|bobholl: 6@H in east is the optimum contract :)|pg||
nt|blewah: both pairs play big club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3Dmaking is likely outcome|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the trick is to stay only in 4@S|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia has taken an early lead here|pg||
nt|rado: slam in @C|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: luckily not possible to misguess @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW bid to 4@s, I think it's a good chance NS will go to 5@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s as in lebensohl showing 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 6NT also....|pg||
nt|blewah: exclusion rkcb now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@D voidwood would be pretty now |pg||
nt|blewah: 5@d|pg||
nt|blewah: or yes 4@d, depending on their agreement|pg||
nt|bobholl: why 1 @S 3rd hand a multi or weak two looks better|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|marlowepi: 1H ? why not X ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not my call but might find the 4-4 fit for whatever value it has here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless that shows 64 in S/H respectively, it seems eccentric|pg||
nt|rado: here 1@C is 15+ bal or @C or any FG|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 1st swing at board 4... great 4@S for Isreal, vs a perfect 3NT (6@C +3 Aces)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 4@H no aces and the optimum contract in the best hand :)|pg||
nt|rado: mean grand at 52 cards but probably 6@S will see|pg||
mb|5C|nt|blewah: 2@h is normal, slower road|pg||
nt|bobholl: although this migth work out better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@C now may be|pg||
nt|offthebend: strong C auction -- is this 2NT forcing by Hristov ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and is GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it should be|pg||
nt|geot: 15+9 HCPs. With some good guessing game is possible|pg||
nt|rado: 1NT is bal FG or some other options|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  South asking for trouble |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H is on|pg||
nt|hedyg: even after a @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznq: on TGRs behalf I'd like to thank... ROLAND (for being helpful and supporting)@H@H@H... ALL COMMENTATORS (for making this event more interesting)@H@H@H Thank you all for your time ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: anyone for 2@C NV vs. voul |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 in hand is the threat but in that case Nwould have played @SK to kill the squeeze|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not me|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: now double in N ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't understand either|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract, however, is normal enough|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4NT is for the minors, which after the takeout double usually promising 4@H, shows a void in spades|pg||
nt|ugis: probably N could have bid smth over 3c..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: was alerted like GF|pg||
nt|rado: 4@D will make the things easy now|pg||
nt|offthebend: why not 2NT over 2H -- to show balanced GF and H stopper ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hristov explain that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps a multi-way bid, including a lebensohl variant|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: NS playing Precision club|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: we can see endless aggressivity with poor outcome|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: and s 3@S now ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  N might double this, expecting strength from partner|pg||
nt|frangos007:  there you go :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  what, I wonder, is 3@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: strong :):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but the colour...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Where I come from it shows a solid suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  not AJxxxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: best lead, removing the ruffs of the red suits in dummy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  Whatever, but I think Ulugol owed his partner 5@h, not 4 with the good trump support|pg||
nt|offthebend: correct |pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably because it wouldnt mean that|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they havent really unearthed much of a fit yet, so i think 5H would be a bit of an exaggeration|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@D likes @Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: with 2nt he denide 5 colour suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am wondering why N passed over 1C:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes of course, but couldnt E bid 4D with a hand that was not as good as this one as dummy for spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and show balancing hand|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: showing*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: salut henri:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hey Hendry|pg||
nt|offthebend: Hi Henri |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Henry|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|rado: 2@C showed bal hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sry misclicked|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: bid your best minor i will support you then |pg||
nt|frangos007:  this should make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i guess he tried to deny 4@h with 3@s, dbl is maybe with 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: uf|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: henri|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting now..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: may be Tanev dont understand 2nt |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: like strong hand (positive)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, when i said that 5H might be a bit too much, i certainly didnt mean that the alternative was a mere 4S|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  2N, in my world, says two places to play|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am quite sure that there is a mild confusion here -- W thinks 2NT is limited |pg||
nt|geot: 4@S is the contract ...if you want to be in game|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@S..|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: me and my partner would have done not that good on this one 1nt 2@C and than 4@H :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even so, why not 4H?|pg||
nt|ritong: by east|pg||
nt|ritong: establishing @ss for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could E have: Txx   JTxx  AQx   QJx ?|pg||
nt|offthebend: if 2NT is limited with some H stopper and D A -- he needs too much to look for a slam |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i think E should realized , his p dont understand 2nt like a positive.. and try to bid something else then PASS|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||
nt|rado: probably some sort of Lebensohl situation cue= denies|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i doubt, since then 3@s would promise 4@h. weird, i don't know really|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Zipovski is well known as "i play 2 conventions partner!" when he plays with unknown partner|pg||
nt|henryb:  RKC - 1KC, |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, i hope so|pg||
nt|henryb:  Do you have the @hQ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see now the bid|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|geot: The trumps works fine, but he needs to guess the club situation|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: may be i direct 4/5 @D would agree @S :(|pg||
nt|henryb:  I assume 2@d showed some values and 2@h would have been an immediate double negative|pg||
nt|ritong: hum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on what grounds could E recognize that?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blewah: yes, that would be the intention too|pg||
nt|frangos007:  going for the possible overtrick?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  trying to discard losing club if @HA is with North, perhaps|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i think the bidding makes clear the @SK is with N and he should have tackled trumps immediately|pg||
nt|frangos007:  it's all down to getting the trumps right|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ugis: only diamond ruffs beat 4 spades|pg||
nt|geot: @C switch now?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: assuming that part has not understood a bid looks unhealthy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|blewah: W just wanted to knoe keycards in @s excluding in @d|pg||
nt|frangos007:  this might help declarer now to make +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Q+K@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but i dont see the queen :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ulugol may have assumed thaat the third heart was the equivalent of the Q opposite partner's 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i guess..|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am betting on 510 though :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|blewah: *know|pg||
nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer should lead the @hJ next|pg||
nt|frangos007:  playing @D for him|pg||
nt|henryb:  I sure would, although I would have been wondering what partner's suit was for 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: me 2.. may be he is thinking abt AJ10xxxx..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 7th|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: but his @d spots are so good he doesnt need to ruff any|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzre: 3@h IS a serious bid..|pg||
nt|henryb:  can declarer afford to safety play hearts?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|geot: diamond back was as good|pg||
