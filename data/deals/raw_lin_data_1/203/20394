nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: easy 4@H to start with |pg||
nt|othered1: A routine strong NT auction, perhaps, but today 4th seat 1N openers are relatively rare,  as someone finds a reason to open in front of them|pg||
nt|bobholl: p p p  1nt  p 2@D superaccept 4@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yup|pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+|nt|rado: Israel leading by 21 vp's so they need 4 or 5 to won the event|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Dessy|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: good ed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: And south gets a psychic 1@D in.  Wonder if they play Precision style, where a 3rd seat 1@D psyche is almost free|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: and 1@D showing weak NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome all to Stara Zagora:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentator (alone so far) is Rado|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|rado: NS use precision with many scientific gadgets:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 2@S looks to be showing a @D fit as well as @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|rado: 10 teams, round robin 12 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hello Marshal|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org results|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|psyck: wonder what 2N was for them|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently a raise of some kind looking at the 4@s rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Can west be t hinking?  Partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: zdr dessy|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rado: info at:http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: hi|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry wrong room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rado: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far a very standard auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello :) to you too.. welcome|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H not showing length, as N is known to have a strong hand but did not reverse to 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: this will be a very routine 5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: the results http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|rado: first blood now , |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has already implied 5 spades but wishes to emphasize the suit due to its quality, and is not crazy about NT with no fit and some potential red- suit problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yeah:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good presume|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: going for some xruff maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: that may not work well if he loses 2@s, 1@h, 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, his best chance would be to get @d fin right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks to be a dull 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: simple 3 nt with 9 (or 10) tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|danilo1: 8 topp tricks ... but guess any lead by West will find ninth one (difficult to immagine @C lead)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: after 3S, though, the auction sort of petered out. both players have enough to try for slam. N despite the highcard minimum has a super hand with controls and a great suit and his ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: small doubleton in exactly the right place. S has 3 controls and a possible trick source and a potentially useful nine of clubs|pg||
nt|rado: Israel needs calm boards and Vito - wild ones:)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|skjaeran:  Still onluy 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  *only|pg||
nt|danilo1: y|pg||
nt|psyck:  2 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome R@H|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not made (yet)|pg||
nt|psyck: not a great game with only 1 entry to dummy & not enough tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@H now is best|pg||
nt|psyck: would often go down even with @h fin on, & no chance here|pg||
nt|rado: 3@S makable and 3@H down one|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen really hit the best lead.|pg||
nt|psyck:  6 feet 9 inches|pg||
nt|psyck:  9.5|pg||
nt|granguru:  skov6.791338|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. since North shown 4-card @H ... not easy lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And good evening to GeO Tislevoll in New Zealand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Going down now.|pg||
nt|geot: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello welcome|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rado: 1st board nothing unusuall|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|psyck:  That was Skov's height, 6' 9,5"...|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Yes, he's a BIG guy.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|h7|nt|danilo1: starting with @C is strange play .. if 3-3, no need to hurry|pg||
nt|psyck: if it not a bad game either, with several chances|pg||
nt|rado: players do not see all 52 cards for down 2 like us|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to  Seppo|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru:  6f 9.48i|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  He could have made it by playing @DA @D after two clubs.|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad prediction 11 tricks |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the bidding at the 3 level was -- and is almost never -- about slam, but rather about game exploration. so it would not have been at all redundant for NS to continue via 4C-4D-4H ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 3S, or for N to  cue  a red suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|zebutin: good day everyone|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|danilo1: y|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am afraid we might be losing connection also |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|psyck: including misdef, there was no cause to duck the @h|pg||
nt|bobholl: now made :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: a regular partnership should know what 4C means in this sequence. there are several useful possibilities.  |pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|psyck:  yes, that would have put pressure on W|pg||

nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently he did try the x ruff & went down as suspected|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on 6@H good save|pg||
nt|bobholl: and a likely push|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of room for differing actions on this  hand, beginning with east's possible opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of options for the auction here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam is of course very playable on the NS cards, and possibly makeable via a squeeze (or pseudo)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|vugraphzre: that what i see is ..auto squeeze :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: mighty try even 7@D|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone know their 1N range?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: the correct side will start bidding @d soon :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like their  headed to a @S fit|pg||
nt|geot: super fit here for E/W. can make all the tricks in a @H contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see the contract :)|pg||
nt|rado: 2NT is INV only with fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
nt|rado: 11 tricks in @S double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
mb|2N|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
nt|gluckenval: hi all and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hi there, welcome|pg||
nt|gluckenval: zdr Dessy|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rado: seems NS use natural methods, not precision sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a colossally strong hand for a multi in most partnerships, even red|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting opening here|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but.. :) good contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/  updated after round 6. Israel in a very strong position|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Team Members http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/teams.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|rado: 5 or 7 hand depending on K@D:)|pg||
nt|geot: In slam - on a club lead, it is on the @D finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||
nt|rado: trump lead is good for defence but declarer still home with 3@C ruffs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Subhash Gupta|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: lead was easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: NV, may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|offthebend: hello everybody|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow not best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ running scores|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzre: sorry crazy mouse :)|pg||
nt|rado: pessimistic approach by W , many would splinter 3@S |pg||
nt|geot: yes, so might as well be in 7 rather than 6, or just game|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are many situations like this in fourth seat where you want to open but are afraid of being outbid so you open with a preempt which  in last seat is of course not weak. here ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: however that is a questionable strategy, because 2D probably wont keep them out of spades if they have them. meanwhile partner could be something like 4153 and you end in hearts ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps down with  110 or 130 to make in diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi there:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Congrats Marshall!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some sort of record?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You just set a new BBO record: 5 lines of commentary|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good point :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hihi|pg||
nt|offthebend: is that really a record :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only because the chatspace is so narrow:)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||
nt|othered1: best defense likely would have started by south leading the long suit |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gmarco24: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hi welcome|pg||
nt|gluckenval: correct play in @H... really unlucky for declarer.... but it happens... (25% of times, more or less :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: this is not the best play in @h, slight better is A@h, @h to Q, since you can lose 2 tricks on KJ behind if you play finesse twice|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|granguru:  claim time already|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about this line, as opposed to setting up a diamond, but with right view in hearts D wont be needed|pg||
nt|bobholl: n can't guess the 4@H in e :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: results|pg||

nt|bobholl: think any reasanoble line will let 4@S make|pg||

nt|Walddk2: San Marino is a state situated on the Italian peninsula on the eastern side of the Apennine Mountains. It is an enclave surrounded by Italy. Its size is just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi) ...|pg||

nt|rado: 6@H very cheap suppose no @D lead from W|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|othered1: Not quite a 2@C bid, because  you run out of rebids pretty quickly|pg||
nt|phil: yes, declarer gets a good count on the hand when the 3rd diamond is played. I do think its stronger for North to duck that heart though, don;t you think? |pg||

mb|2D!|nt|marlowepi: 3N by W looks good as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland has the 'R' convention closely trailing the F & G conventions in the list of avoidable ones|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt x on a @S  lead :) wouldn't have found that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: for the results|pg||
nt|offthebend: only makeable game is 3NT by West -- hard to get there |pg||
nt|rado: and probably will end in 3NT by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: @S guess solved now so will make|pg||
nt|phil: me neither :)|pg||
nt|phil: but even on a heart, there arent a lot of tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sunsamvar: 2@S transfer and 2nt acceptance|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no 3nt |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: true CK but still a brave bid at unfav vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: playing NT as nat in that position, I would also bid 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all, sorry i am late:):(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S had not an obvious pass for some of us|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes a 53 major suit fit is not the key to the city. here 5C is a much more comfortable spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy it looks like W can get home, but there is work to be done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as the cards lie, even 6C is more comfortable than 4S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has every reason to think long and carefully here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though soon we may start wondering if the screen door has been raised:)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Marko, I think this could help you : http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_4.htm|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: on their way to 7 i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3N by W is only cold game, but 5C could easily succeed|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5C can be beaten only on S ruff now |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  I play 1@s by E as 4+ cards & x with less|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now making as crucial entry got|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and this is not that hard..|pg||
nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: good morning to everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
nt|othered1: This would be a v ery easy Blue Team Club auction, where south would show an ace and a king on his first response, then @H fit, then cue-bidding should focus on t he value of the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @SQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of chances for it though. ace of hearts lead will set it, or spade ace then heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of chances to set i mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: one down or two down ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one|pg||
pc|s4|nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
nt|geot: Not so many top-tricks here, will have to work well to get 9|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice arrival to proper contract|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: 5@S-7@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller would reach this surely with their tarzan precision|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: N will cash heart ace to get a signal|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2, when S ruff..back @H|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like NS play upside down then|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i am surprised that common problem is misunderstood|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: needs to play @d now|pg||
nt|hedyg: will not be in dummy again|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ntmon: with all necessary info delivered by opps|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if s still interested N has an easy 7 @H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: well done..|pg||
nt|henryb:  Whatever the bids meant, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while,  Bye for now.|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and play will present no problem with @S 32|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @H 31 is enough already|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or more to the point, @h 3-1|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: even with @H 40 there are enough chances|pg||
nt|hedyg: not know about singleton A@D he is thinking 6@c was off right now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|bobholl: S still can't calculate the @C J :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it's simple calculation: KJx(x) with N or S, A wins with one, Q wins with another- it's equal so far|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
mc|10|nt|gmarco24: but, with twice finesse you lose to KJ second behind, and there's no way to lose on 2-2 if you cash A|pg||

nt|gmarco24: 104 and 105|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have a slight problem with preemptive openers who rebid later. imo when you make a preemptive opening you have bid your hand and let your partner do the bidding from there on|pg||
nt|famus: hello viladimir|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|rado: 5@h and 4@s makable now|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3H X may be final contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: both sides play Precision club|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|rado: seems 2@H showing both Majors|pg||
nt|rado: this time cold 3NT since @D 4-4|pg||
nt|rado: same INV fit|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Marko... I don't need of 5 tricks... 4 tricks were enough....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: very easy to 4 @h for EW|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: whether it is ok to open 7=card preempts at the 2 level is a longstanding controversy|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  On a double finesse and trumps 3-2 more or less.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt not alerted ?|pg||
nt|zebutin: now just to see if they bid it... Qx and Qxx isn't exactly best values for heart game|pg||
nt|blewah: hi everyone|pg||
nt|zebutin: hi Aria|pg||
nt|mathat: with 13 points in jacoby 4 @h bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: if 3@D would have been minisplinter no problem but now ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|rado: and 3@s for NS too:)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: am i talking spanish?  :)|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|bobholl: on @C lead also +2 otherwise +1|pg||
nt|henryb:  Palazo is a player after my own style, not opening that dreadful 12 count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 4H also makes without spade lead (or 2 diamonds and spade shift|pg||
nt|rado: mayve 4NT to show 2 suits now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: quick pass :)|pg||
nt|famus: These bg players specially Kalin did v well in Brazil to get BG the bronze--appear to be a bit off color here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psyck:  need more than that|pg||
nt|bobholl: you can subract 1 point for 4333 and one for aceless agree totally|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no way for any different lead i think|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4H can be made even on a S shift after 2 Diamonds |pg||
nt|offthebend: H to 9 forces the Q out -- and then H can be drawn later |pg||
nt|rado: that's almost 100 % for 2nd and 3rd level preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I may have preferred some number of @c instead of the negative 1@d on the Strong @c opening|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is perhaps less objectionable if playing multi|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it's a play for 4 tricks, you'll lose to KJ second behind|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck:  you have 3 @c's in hand to take care of|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Ruff two of them. You need @Ds to behave too.|pg||
nt|psyck:  and too much work to do as x ruff meands you may not get 2nd @d trick|pg||
nt|danilo1: logical decision by East ... @S shorthness is not encouraging|pg||
nt|psyck: Will likely get to 4@h in due course of time|pg||
nt|blewah: jacoby still on after pass it seems here|pg||
nt|bobholl: not a convincing bidding but it works :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 4-4-3-2 they open 1@H, thus the alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: this will not take too long|pg||
nt|blewah: 2 @cs abd one @s to loose|pg||
nt|blewah: *and|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: this has no chance of misdefence -- one down |pg||
pc|c6|nt|skjaeran:  Terrible slam.|pg||
nt|psyck:  don't think it is soo great even w/o trump lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  i wouldn't mind being in it on this lead though|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so maybe @D neg better after all CK|pg||
nt|psyck: the trump break will lead to 2/3 @h losers, nothing much else to lose|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|geot: 4NT was an option, but can easily be wrong|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@c-3@c-3@h-4@h bidding also possible|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psyck: most likely +1 losing 2 trumps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: IF P has @S suit and hand is a misfit i dont want to show a +ive with a 2@C i what i meant|pg||
nt|famus: run of the mikk boring hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|blewah: *lose to be more corrective :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  but KQKQQ is a high card combination many would open|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobholl: now going for the ups|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as so often occurs, a preempt pushes opps into a winning 3N when a quieter auction might have ended in 4M going down in 44 fit|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugraphzre: both sides play Precision club|pg||

nt|geot: Double fit both directions (again)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no, thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: as far as I remember 3@D is not the common used cue here, sometning special|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||

nt|gmarco24: tell us Rado, Karaivanov-Trendafilov are in national selection?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|rado: yes|pg||
nt|rado: good 4@C bid opens a chance for beating 4@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: or even pass|pg||

nt|gmarco24: Mihov-Nanev? not Nanev-Gunev?|pg||
nt|rado: last BB in Brasil 3rd place|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you only gain from QTx or QTxx in one of the two hands, or Tx in S, which i think is also 12 cases, pretty even|pg||

pc|sA|nt|psyck:  Ideal deal to defend for those who forget the bidding once it is over|pg||
nt|psyck:  or those who pick the card nearest to thump to lead|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome andy|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that a voluntarily bid game, dbld down 3 was down in both rooms|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Marshall:)|pg||
nt|offthebend: why would N prefer 3NT on the bidding ? South seemed to be quite short in H on the bidding |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N tried to indicate a lack of real enthusiasm for NT by bidding 3H, so thatr if S bid 3S and he then bid 3N it would  be a weak suggestion for NT|pg||
nt|rado: there was a chanse E to open weak 2@H ( they use 5 cards opening) but 2Nd pos and 5332 shape probably stopped him|pg||
nt|rado: now 2@d opening|pg||
nt|rado: but not at red sorry:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: bye CK and all|pg||
nt|psyck: tx Sunil|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it was bid as a save|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzre: sorry 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: last one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he was trying to let S choose|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: enjoy the rest of the session all|pg||
nt|bobholl: after 1@H double they migth miss 4@S|pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@S for NS, and save in minor for EW?|pg||
nt|bobholl: who should open ? west for the lead ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: make your choice 1 2 3 4 @H or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, white on white...a little unusual but 11 card fits can do that|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bobholl: this is cheaper :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Should E open? I do not think so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, 1@h double a good idea at the vul & with passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the real criterion in such decisions is: if we do push the opps to 5H, are they likely to go down? if not, less attractoive to save, esp with 2 likely defensiove tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder how many pairs have 4@h to play in this situation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, i said that inside it:):(|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i will|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  The shape is awkward. If he was 4-0-5-4 I think there is more of a case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because his hand also makes a ten trick game look a bit distant|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have liked to have at least the H10 before bidding 3NT -- but south though his HQ may help |pg||
mb|4S|nt|zebutin: yes...i must admit i couldn't have passed with Wests hand|pg||
nt|rado: 1@C balanced or @C or any FG, 1@D TRF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as it would have if E had held the heart king|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: do you like N's dbl?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: just ask..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: some would overcall 1@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not at all, but sometimes we all make bids we dont like because we have to bid and everything else looks even less appetizing|pg||
nt|offthebend: should N not buid 3D with Qx and wait for S to try 3H or 3S on the way to looking for best spot |pg||
nt|geot: E/W may not get in at all here, and can not be blamed, really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 5@H is cheap |pg||
nt|marlowepi: not ao cheap if opps bid 6D|pg||
nt|phil: 1 looks sort of obvious to me even if you play wide ranging preempts|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H goes for 800 so better pass :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that D by N. maybe 4H is better, planning to correct spades to NT for minors|pg||
nt|phil: with a void heart, its unlikely the w/r opponents are bidding 4@h, so maybe the mild overbid of 4N is best? |pg||
nt|phil: *likely|pg||
nt|phil: I think East will get away with 5@h here if he bids it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: inside out|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  4@h looks like a better contract than 3NT.|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry even 6@H goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|rado: 1@h was quite normal overcall I think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck:  4@h could make even if you get trumps wrong|pg||
nt|bobholl: only objection against double is only 3 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like any plan that strongly emphasizes the minors, as pd is likely to have a fit. i think the double was based on the fear that S had 18 balanced and that 3N was the only game. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: narrow target to try to hit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= may have longer @ds|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|skjaeran:  Can discard a spade on clubs.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 3@D would be forcing, ! would choose 3@D rather than jump to 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  right lead found|pg||
nt|offthebend: I never double with that hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: many perhaps wondering why S did not raise diamonds. the answer must be that NS play "equal level conversion"|pg||
nt|rado: good shape, quick tricks...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: same results in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: same play|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yeah|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: u r faster|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but only with weak NT hands 11-14 points|pg||
nt|rado: Majors breaking good for Declarer but minors not so..|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a very succesful lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: 2@h must have shown an intermediate hand with 5@h & W was not interested in game opp less than strong @c opening values|pg||
nt|zebutin: and some might even bid with Easts hand something like balancing 1nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT easier to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: friendly major suits|pg||

pc|h7|nt|psyck: I can understand E not bidding as he expects vul opps to be in a misfit as pd did not x 1@h|pg||
nt|gmarco24: rare to see the first level competition  :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gluckenval: not so easy this 3@H.... |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: it is a intresting overcall :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: dont u think?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|geot: E/W has a nice heart contract. Third board in a row a heart fit is not found, and no-one has really done anything silly |pg||
nt|geot: yes, Rado...a 1H overcall would have worked nicely|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rado: 4@s has good chances restricting losers to trump and 2@h|pg||

nt|rado: and 5@D also makable|pg||
nt|gluckenval: well, I would bid the same... some time my p when bid 2@H has really 5+ cards :)|pg||
nt|rado: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|famus: this might become interesting --declarer has a 9th trk problen|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but a few players will bid 2@H overcall|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|danilo1: 4@H much better contract than 3NT |pg||
nt|psyck: *E was not...|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: what do u prefer|pg||
nt|alnanda: ......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a 3D opening by W (not that i recommend it) would almost surely briung a huge reward on this deal|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: nice R:)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|andyv:  but you were right, Marshall....the vul got to E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i just bid in these situations, despite the dangers, and somehow it rarely works out disastrously. often it is -100 vs +50 but that is a fleabite|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but with some serious thinking..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: long i mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D is perhaps not available to them as a natural preempt|pg||

nt|danilo1: East hand on limit to make slam try in @C ... and West's one on limit to accept it ... together - slam danger |pg||
nt|granguru:  3@D is a slam invitation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has a whopper of a 1N bid. 2C worth considering as alternative|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has a nasty guess between the majors but he gambled rigth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NV i would endorse 3D|pg||
nt|ntmon: what are the standards for vul overcall at 2nd level and passed partner?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: if 3@D is transfer  worth 4@H ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N with good @h support and no @c stopper|pg||
nt|rado: 11 tricks for NS , unless EW cash theyr @D |pg||
nt|gluckenval: looking at the board, how many pass/1@S from South ? |pg||
mb|4D|nt|henryb:  4@s is a sensible contract, just needing the @hA onside. It isn't.|pg||
nt|bobholl: both bidding strange but 3nt is only makeable game bridge is a funny game :)|pg||
nt|frangos007:  looks like a routine -1|pg||

mb|4H|nt|granguru:  thats why W is considering ..|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H positive response|pg||
nt|granguru:  probably in 1 minor|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  EW is not a regular partnership. Hope they know what they're doing now.|pg||
nt|granguru:  not known|pg||
nt|psyck:  Other room E knew pd had 4 carder @h with likely some wastage, after kickback revealed an ace missing, maybe should stop in game with min hand|pg||
nt|offthebend: pretty timid bidding all around :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: overtricks coming.... may be too many overtricks. This auction from South indicate a minimum hand, but with North spot I probably reopen the bid. 7 controls are often enough for a ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: slam, with a std opening bid from the partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: what do u think abt opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, agree with u|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d may have just been a 2nd relay, G|pg||
nt|frangos007:  -1 now|pg||
mb|6C|nt|blewah: i think just relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ntmon: the final contract is the consequence of the overcall |pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: after A @s play @h and finesse @c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|granguru:  4@c looks agrees trump|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gluckenval: I would pass.... 1) vulnerable, 2) I can give the hand with a ghestem later, 3) I'm a rabbit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hedy did you agree abt 12 tricks?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  This should be 12 imps to Luxenbourg, which will essentially tie the match|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has to lead a @C in time but i guess he will |pg||
nt|henryb:  BTW, is there a website for standings?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru:  4@H no @d control|pg||
nt|granguru:  only a @d lead permits to win|pg||
nt|psyck:  i've no idea what the bids mean here, but looks like they knew what they meant to do|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|bobholl: there is i guess but don't know whre|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|zebutin: now little easier, but if they drive @S A down, you must feel little uneasy that @C finese isn't actually working|pg||
nt|zebutin: even if it works for the 1st time you take it that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: where|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might try to find @CJ with west|pg||
nt|rado: yes if W starts with DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4) r u not 5) good point 6) i like it :) 7) may be next time will not open with those kind of shapes :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: lol :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :):)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  made!|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure if they had this option (lot of partnerships use it) - but if possible, better would be to transfer in @C and show slam try with @H single/void ... West would than ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably not accept|pg||
nt|frangos007:  to limit to -1|pg||
nt|famus: game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: i always agree with the operator|pg||

nt|frangos007:  @D7 is high, but not point in trying to play loser on loser|pg||
pc|c8|nt|phil: but 2N looks hungry too|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|cT|pc|d6|pg||

pc|h3|nt|granguru:  needs HA on S|pg||

mb|1S|nt|psyck: luckily not possible to misguess @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW bid to 4@s, I think it's a good chance NS will go to 5@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s as in lebensohl showing 4@hs and no @s stopper|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|chrisky: 6NT also....|pg||
nt|blewah: exclusion rkcb now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@D voidwood would be pretty now |pg||
nt|blewah: 5@d|pg||
nt|blewah: or yes 4@d, depending on their agreement|pg||
nt|bobholl: why 1 @S 3rd hand a multi or weak two looks better|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: 1H ? why not X ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not my call but might find the 4-4 fit for whatever value it has here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless that shows 64 in S/H respectively, it seems eccentric|pg||
nt|rado: here 1@C is 15+ bal or @C or any FG|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 1st swing at board 4... great 4@S for Isreal, vs a perfect 3NT (6@C +3 Aces)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bobholl: 4@H no aces and the optimum contract in the best hand :)|pg||
nt|rado: mean grand at 52 cards but probably 6@S will see|pg||
mb|4S|nt|blewah: 2@h is normal, slower road|pg||
nt|bobholl: although this migth work out better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@C now may be|pg||
nt|offthebend: strong C auction -- is this 2NT forcing by Hristov ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and is GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it should be|pg||
nt|geot: 15+9 HCPs. With some good guessing game is possible|pg||
nt|rado: 1NT is bal FG or some other options|pg||
mb|d|nt|frangos007:  South asking for trouble |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H is on|pg||
nt|hedyg: even after a @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznq: on TGRs behalf I'd like to thank... ROLAND (for being helpful and supporting)@H@H@H... ALL COMMENTATORS (for making this event more interesting)@H@H@H Thank you all for your time ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: anyone for 2@C NV vs. voul |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 in hand is the threat but in that case Nwould have played @SK to kill the squeeze|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not me|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: now double in N ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't understand either|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract, however, is normal enough|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4NT is for the minors, which after the takeout double usually promising 4@H, shows a void in spades|pg||
nt|ugis: probably N could have bid smth over 3c..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: was alerted like GF|pg||
nt|rado: 4@D will make the things easy now|pg||
nt|offthebend: why not 2NT over 2H -- to show balanced GF and H stopper ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hristov explain that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps a multi-way bid, including a lebensohl variant|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Israel|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: NS playing Precision club|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: we can see endless aggressivity with poor outcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: and s 3@S now ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  N might double this, expecting strength from partner|pg||
nt|frangos007:  there you go :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  what, I wonder, is 3@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: strong :):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but the colour...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Where I come from it shows a solid suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  not AJxxxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: best lead, removing the ruffs of the red suits in dummy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  Whatever, but I think Ulugol owed his partner 5@h, not 4 with the good trump support|pg||
nt|offthebend: correct |pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably because it wouldnt mean that|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they havent really unearthed much of a fit yet, so i think 5H would be a bit of an exaggeration|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@D likes @Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: with 2nt he denide 5 colour suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am wondering why N passed over 1C:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes of course, but couldnt E bid 4D with a hand that was not as good as this one as dummy for spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and show balancing hand|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: showing*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: salut henri:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hey Hendry|pg||
nt|offthebend: Hi Henri |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Henry|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|rado: 2@C showed bal hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sry misclicked|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: bid your best minor i will support you then |pg||
nt|frangos007:  this should make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i guess he tried to deny 4@h with 3@s, dbl is maybe with 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: uf|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: henri|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting now..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: may be Tanev dont understand 2nt |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: like strong hand (positive)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, when i said that 5H might be a bit too much, i certainly didnt mean that the alternative was a mere 4S|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N, in my world, says two places to play|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am quite sure that there is a mild confusion here -- W thinks 2NT is limited |pg||
nt|geot: 4@S is the contract ...if you want to be in game|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@S..|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: me and my partner would have done not that good on this one 1nt 2@C and than 4@H :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even so, why not 4H?|pg||
nt|ritong: by east|pg||
nt|ritong: establishing @ss for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could E have: Txx   JTxx  AQx   QJx ?|pg||
nt|offthebend: if 2NT is limited with some H stopper and D A -- he needs too much to look for a slam |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i think E should realized , his p dont understand 2nt like a positive.. and try to bid something else then PASS|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||
nt|rado: probably some sort of Lebensohl situation cue= denies|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i doubt, since then 3@s would promise 4@h. weird, i don't know really|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Zipovski is well known as "i play 2 conventions partner!" when he plays with unknown partner|pg||
nt|henryb:  RKC - 1KC, |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, i hope so|pg||
nt|henryb:  Do you have the @hQ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see now the bid|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|geot: The trumps works fine, but he needs to guess the club situation|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: may be i direct 4/5 @D would agree @S :(|pg||
nt|henryb:  I assume 2@d showed some values and 2@h would have been an immediate double negative|pg||
nt|ritong: hum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on what grounds could E recognize that?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|blewah: yes, that would be the intention too|pg||
nt|frangos007:  going for the possible overtrick?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  trying to discard losing club if @HA is with North, perhaps|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i think the bidding makes clear the @SK is with N and he should have tackled trumps immediately|pg||
nt|frangos007:  it's all down to getting the trumps right|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ugis: only diamond ruffs beat 4 spades|pg||
nt|geot: @C switch now?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming that part has not understood a bid looks unhealthy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|blewah: W just wanted to knoe keycards in @s excluding in @d|pg||
nt|frangos007:  this might help declarer now to make +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Q+K@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but i dont see the queen :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ulugol may have assumed thaat the third heart was the equivalent of the Q opposite partner's 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i guess..|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am betting on 510 though :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|blewah: *know|pg||
nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer should lead the @hJ next|pg||
nt|frangos007:  playing @D for him|pg||
nt|henryb:  I sure would, although I would have been wondering what partner's suit was for 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: me 2.. may be he is thinking abt AJ10xxxx..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 7th|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: but his @d spots are so good he doesnt need to ruff any|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzre: 3@h IS a serious bid..|pg||
nt|henryb:  can declarer afford to safety play hearts?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h7|nt|geot: diamond back was as good|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  N should play @h toward the Q|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he will give 2@ds and 2@hs and be -2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|frangos007:  wd|pg||
nt|frangos007:  now +1|pg||
nt|geot: ruff now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  Well done!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  that is cash the A, then lead towards dummy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: not enough.. :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  W is known to have the K@h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|offthebend: yayyyyy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzre: now easy|pg||
nt|ntmon: no swing|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s6|nt|gmarco24: Karaivanov is killing declarer with "always @s" return whenever he is in trick|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  A few IMPs for de Botton on the last board. Congrats to the winners: Esterson|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|bobholl: has to guess @C for 2@H making :)|pg||
nt|phil: has good count now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|geot: nice defence. The contract would have had better chances played by W|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|s4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Bye all|pg||

nt|zebutin: would be sad to bid 6@H after 4/5@D and see partner change it to 6@S...|pg||
nt|blewah: ow, that would be sad|pg||
nt|psyck: he should have set suit with 3@h on 2@d as suggested, then had enough options|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @hs 3-2, no hard done|pg||
nt|gmarco24: also, one of the points where beginners usually go wrong - trying to ruff with long trumps|pg||
nt|rado: yes nevermind declarers or defence:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think that even if E is limited W can bid 4H. Couldnt E still have something like:  Txx   QTxx   AQJx   xx, or even a bit more  ?|pg||
nt|geot: Actually diamond back was much better than club switch, sorry....on a club switch declarer could have won the contract|pg||
nt|gluckenval: very good competitive bid for E/W.... 3@C was cold on the other line|pg||
nt|hedyg: for info and results: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 6@S 7@D ??|pg||
nt|rado: now danger for EW|pg||
nt|rado: if old "penalty dbl " after preempt applied|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|frangos007:  this will give the beleaguered Cyprus team considerable pleasure :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|ugis: pass?|pg||
mb|1N!|an|!C+!D|nt|bobholl: bit strong for a NV 2@H isn't it ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how do you guess the singleton @D as east ??|pg||
nt|bobholl: he just tries to get the contract cheap :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  @s is a strange (to my eyes) choice|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he does|pg||
nt|ritong: is leroumain a BBO username, dessy?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT is fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: tempting to pass with those club tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt looks sound enough but on a @S lead not that good :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 2h = weak 2, 5 card suit possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|blewah: setting up @h suit and assume captaincy with a void is usually tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: on any lead but small @D at least 1 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to go wrong here|pg||
nt|ugis: 8 tricks if they manage to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: the bidding and the contract:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: they wants their usernames in here|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: so we have the famous cornel teodorescu on stage|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c is natural and forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a weak hand E would have bid 2NT asking partner to bid 3@c|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobholl: 3@S a good tactical choice |pg||
nt|phil: yep|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c should be forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may opt for 2@s or 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 7@D goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  especially since it does not clue partner in at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Zipovski's p may be doesnt know that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: now N is in danger from his partner  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  3N could be in trouble with the @c break|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: which is why i suggested that W should give up chances of grand & settle for the practical way to reach 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: east afraid of his weak @S i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: still OK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|henryb:  If you were going to bid 4@s, why not bid 4@c on the way?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  both sides have done well to control the bidding|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Harald Skjæran and Danilo Stojanovic|pg||
nt|bobholl: so far for good tactics :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contrary to expectations, 4S failed in the other room on  19, so Montenegro lost 4 instead of gaining 9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H sort of a practical call, though once in a while you miss a slam|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Dessy, he might say some things after this board, try to inform us :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: as long as Fisher doesnt play the J@c...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobholl: very good @D Q keeps communication and not a ruff yet :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: he already did it|pg||
nt|gmarco24: oh boy  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: dbl was penn..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but very calm|pg||
nt|gluckenval: board 8 ... well, with that @S split also 3NT was cold :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to CK|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck:  e.g. a @s lead duck all around would probably beat 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 100 better than -180 but 140 is better|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobholl: it worked in the end :)|pg||
nt|geot: E/W over board here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|blewah: yes, practical bid is a good one if you haven't discussed science with p|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck: after 2@d-3@h-3@s cue- he still has option of exclusion key card ask of 5@d|pg||
nt|ritong: they are not overenterprising, are they?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|frangos007:  3@H not the easiest of contracts - this will need to be played well|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c4|nt|frangos007:  but cards are kindly placed for declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|skjaeran:  Nice defence by north|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|offthebend: another slam bit the dust on the same lead |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|nt|rado: shift J and Q @S and 3NT is ok, now no game:(|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Established communications to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: even if S did not want to bid 2@h on 1@h other table (in case it showed better hand?) he should have bid it on 1@S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|zebutin: yes i think on previous deal you easily can find 7 if you have that in cards, if you start with 3@H|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|frangos007:  W might have tried to get her ruff|pg||
nt|frangos007:  in spades, but perhaps she expects to make her @SQ anyway|pg||
nt|frangos007:  declarer now worried about repeated club forces|pg||
nt|frangos007:  so not easy to draw last trump|pg||
nt|frangos007:  he might easily lose complete control and end up several down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: I dont mind 1@S from E too much, although many would probably pass|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|gmarco24: a few evenings ago he said to him:"if you are not sure, keep the bidding alive. first rule!"|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, i guess, Koldzic is just sticking to the first rule|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Rumen was surpriced on 3@H bid :)|pg||
nt|rado: we are happy they missed to discussed what dbl was, but next Opponents wil not have that chance:)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ugis: E should have signalled the spade A, looks like he did not. Far from the best defence by E - diamond ruff also rather obvious|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|offthebend: Henri , would you bid 3S by N ?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck:  Declarer just hoping for @s44 or some such fav lie of cards|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@h here is pretty normal, i think but i don't know about W's pass|pg||
nt|ritong: aceless  annoying|pg||
nt|ritong: or almost|pg||
nt|ritong: many jacks|pg||
nt|offthebend: yes but 4th trump :)|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck: Not sure what the redouble shows for them here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  well, it was a very small chance anyway, but the correct play would have been to play the @SK and hope to pin the Q|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobholl: system with 2@D as multi or MF could reach 6@H in east |pg||
nt|geot: I would have bid myself as East, that is for sure, and played in game :(|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rado: if no 1@S then W would DBL again 2@D and now another test for E how many @S to bid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|blewah: i usually play wide range of overcall|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frangos007:  because even if the @SA was singleton, he would still lose two spades|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bobholl: why not J@H ?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|zebutin: declarer must have misscounted something|pg||
nt|bobholl: good reason :)|pg||

nt|zebutin: or might try something that needs 14 cards on one opponent to work|pg||
nt|psyck: My counting is often limited to 1, 2, 3, many.|pg||
nt|bobholl: seeing 52 cards is always easier :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N SHOULD BE EASY|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another possible pickup for montenegro, if they can bid and make 6H in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after failing in 4S they may well do so|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|gluckenval: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ for results|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i would settle for low road|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  a tricky hand with points fairly evenly distributed and no strong distributions|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, i invite differently as responder|pg||
nt|ritong: via stayman|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2S. a jump to 3S should be 6 Losing Trick Count|pg||
nt|rado: 2@c here is 15-17 P natural|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|bobholl: poor n has to find a bid |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 nt would be my choice|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N perhaps?|pg||
nt|bobholl: same choice |pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s possible but unattractive on that suit|pg||
nt|phil: nice fit here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  on these hands you always feel good about making your contract, especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|geot: Can make 6@C on the spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: in 4 spades declarer will have to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: so, 2@h is either nada or gf|pg||
nt|geot: but not likely to reach it?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|danilo1: excellent by N ... he knew by the lead declarer max single @S ... to note - @SK would lead to 3NT made ... since than time for declarer to establish 3 @H tricks |pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C suffers from bad finesses|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c now|pg||
nt|zebutin: East did the disciplined thing by passing twice...i might have been tempted to bid 2@S at some point...sad to admit... :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass?????????|pg||
nt|bobholl: is that a suit ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of lost oppirtunities in this match...on  14 NS here missed a 5D slam....only to win 6 when  opps in other room didnt get beyond 3D|pg||
nt|frangos007:  aggressive double by West|pg||
nt|offthebend: bd 7 -- 2Dx got converted in open troom on another misunderstanding and gained 3 imps :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: when he plays the A@s he will have a nice surprise|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  S really has nothing more to say|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mathat: 3 nt and 5 1c only|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if you pass the S  hand which is defendable|pg||
nt|phil: wouldnt occur to me to open that South trash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt occur to me to pass at these colors:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would open but with an 11-13 NT :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N would seem to be holding a textbook responsive double here|pg||
nt|ugis: might missguess now - it is more likely that N has the A of diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: therefore, superaccepts are differently considered|pg||
nt|rado: 2NT was pup to 3@C with several meanings|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strange lead if P couldn't bid 1 @S |pg||
nt|henryb:  a strange lead given that partner could not make a negative double |pg||
nt|andyv:  but the vul is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  this is now pushing E/W into dangerous territory|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he decided it was likelier that Popov led from K rather than J|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  great commenters think alike|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: they discuss that .. Rumen will not pass 2@Sx - will bid 2nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: he has 17hcp|pg||
pc|hK|nt|skjaeran:  Not the worst of slams, but should stop below the 6-level.|pg||
nt|mathat: 4 @c mb|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3C was forcing|pg||
nt|ugis: and it takes some nerves for S to play small diamond twice :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that is a good method for structuring the status of superaccepts|pg||
nt|ritong: well, the (relatively)new ideas about the way to invite impact some|pg||
nt|gluckenval: practical bid for Fisher|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frangos007:  West far too aggressive for me|pg||
nt|rado: DBL of 2@C could be misleading here since he has another good suit  suppose partner had only Kxxx(x) in @H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|blewah: i would have entered in the 2nd chance too, Seppo|pg||
nt|psyck: it is a good slam, should be bid both rooms|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N dicing with death|pg||
nt|bobholl: in @C only 4 :(|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|frangos007:  almost certainly one down, might be more|pg||
nt|frangos007:  difficult for declarer to guess the heart queen correctly, after this bidding|pg||
nt|rado: this time N has natural lead @D:)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: and probably 10-11 tricks for him|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: 2 entries to the @D now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is betting as though his majors were  xx    Axxx|pg||
nt|offthebend: there are other ways to super accept -- 3M is basically 4-cards and minimum -- may be with some prime cards like Ace and K in side suit/s|pg||
nt|ritong: i am not saying it is a revolution, i say that one has to review this stuff if inviting via stayman|pg||
pc|sK|nt|frangos007:  but might get the trumps right|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck:  good slam in fact, need little more than one of the fin working |pg||
nt|bobholl: should yes but will ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: again N refuses to bid 3N|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mathat: to pass|pg||
nt|ugis: N should play A and 10, not K|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|phil: I thought South was endplayed into it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|skjaeran:  I'm told 2NT asked for aces.|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he has a lot of tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt is so often superior to 5 of a minor and not only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  value of trump switch is non existent...S needed to make an attacking move|pg||
nt|ugis: so that declarer places hK with S|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe West can sort out Easts distribution here, but can he find out about both the AKs?|pg||
nt|geot: wow|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: @S lead and 1 down :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have never really gotten the point of superaccepting with a minimum, even at IMPs, just because you have four trumps. why go out of your way to convert a plus to a minus when ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: partner is weak?|pg||
nt|rado: not sure but seemed 3@D was asking and 3@H @S singleton, and 4@D cue|pg||
nt|geot: On a diamond lead he would have had 12 already scoring the J, without a diamond lead it is a 50/50 slam, and it works:) |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck: yes, several chances, none of which work here|pg||
nt|psyck: except @d lead :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E had no real reason to double 3S, which only gives more options to NS. on this auction W was already going to  lead a spade eevn with a void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i understand the 2H rebid by S in context, but there is something wrong when one has to rebid the same 5332 nothing hand to avoid defending. N should have bid|pg||
nt|frangos007:  now now :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: but we have seen in the past that E doesnt like to play his A@S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|skjaeran:  By a reliable source|pg||
nt|granguru:  so 2@c must be a relay according @h|pg||
nt|gluckenval: are we sure about @DJ ?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|frangos007:  not now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhhhhh!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|skjaeran:  3NT asked for cuebids|pg||
nt|bobholl: will try to ruff out @H Q and than @D finesse :)|pg||
nt|ugis: sorry, 10 tricks allways :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frangos007:  he might have tested North by trying the @HJ instead|pg||
nt|frangos007:  he should have developed hearts anyway, trying to limit his spade losers|pg||
pc|dK|nt|granguru:  i would guess 2@d is a bal hand|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  3H=2 without Q|pg||
nt|granguru:  3n IS A NEW ASKING|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk on 5@D ... Sould shoud bid slam (or 5@S) ... already shown no slam interest before|pg||
nt|psyck: @h drop, @d fin, squeeze, all in vain|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree...and N's silence makes it difficult if not impossible for S to find the right switch|pg||
nt|ugis: thought he has a spade loser :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ( i should have played the A@S on that 4@s hand)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: guess this is a 70% slam or so|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck:  with @hq & @cK known to be missing, N did not fancy the slam|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|zebutin: if declarer would see all cards, might just try running the @D J|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|frangos007:  heart to the 10 or J keeps your losers down|pg||
nt|frangos007:  whether it wins or loses|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|gmarco24: x@c maybe|pg||
pc|s4|nt|frangos007:  if it wins, you come back to the ace and repeat the finesse|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dT|nt|zebutin: would opponent really cover from Q9xx?|pg||
nt|gluckenval: thx dessy|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  however, no damage done as contract does seem normal enough|pg||
mc|6|nt|zebutin: but ofc that is impossible line in real life, giving 0% chance instead of some good real chances|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry somewhat less |pg||

nt|frangos007:  this was risky but declarer escaped lightly|pg||
nt|henryb:  An easy 3N for N-S|pg||
nt|ritong: depends also if your suit is @hs or @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: preempting with @ss is pessimistic|pg||
nt|geot: Vito found the 6-4 heart fit on board 4 N/S, and scored a double game swing (15 imps)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frangos007:  2@D might have made anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|gmarco24: good defence, they understand each other|pg||
nt|rado: here some auction expected|pg||
nt|offthebend: I agree with that 100% -- with spades , you do have some freedom :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes they may make it, but they havent bid it yet, and are not at all likely to if vul, and if they are nonvul they usually feel the risk -reward ratio does not favor bidding as you ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: may have only a 7 card fit|pg||
nt|ritong: since, 90% of the time, if they balance, they will let you alone in 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: the necessaty of 3@C is not clear to me :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rado: 2@C precision style|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: which is still a good enough % to bid it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bobholl: ew not precision ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4@S by West is makeable, but need to get the clubs right or develop clubs before diamond tricks need to be lost|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d multi & 3@h pass/correct I presume (I prefer 3@s to 3@h)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is this an upgrade to 15 - 17 or within range|pg||
nt|rado: now 2@D or simple 1M?|pg||
nt|ritong: if they balance over 2@s that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  bad spade break makes the hand not easy to handle|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might get 3NT here|pg||
nt|ugis: one of the boards where either 5 or 7 diamonds can be made :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: maybe polish club or something...?|pg||
nt|blewah: i think they did|pg||
nt|frangos007:  which always makes|pg||
nt|rado: and 11-14 p |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  If its 14-16, South should surely have passed|pg||
nt|bobholl: no slam interest and don't tell opponents too much |pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: very disciplined pass by W here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: N conservatism works here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  I do not agree with 3@H - should be practical - West has indicated a minimum opening hand|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i really do not understand what he is considering|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the 3NT bid is automatic, imo|pg||
nt|offthebend: flip side to that when pard is some 5-5 ( M+m) -- he may not move with 7-8 points over a simple rebid of 2M by the opener |pg||
nt|ritong: hey radoslav, you caught three motormouths  poor priateliu:)|pg||
nt|geot: Can E/W make 5@D here? I dont think so, but it is close|pg||
nt|hedyg: treacherous 7@D lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c was an overbid, S expected more with pd|pg||
nt|psyck: ya, i assumed strong @c when i saw Bd 20|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mildly astonishing 10-IMP gain for Montenegro on  20 when NS in other room did not reach 4S. S had a super hand for spades but underbid it  drastically|pg||
nt|gluckenval: strong club and weak 1NT.... a lot of precision's players aniway using the strong 1NT...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: guess a strange upgrade|pg||
nt|rado: down 2 wil not be good for EW with easy 3NT|pg||
nt|gmarco24: let's see if there is -3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ugis: 7 because partner denied cue bids in H and C?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frangos007:  ah well :)|pg||
nt|geot: trump switch is best, I think|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|frangos007:  perhaps he likes to make his partner work for it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: they play strong 1nt|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: Interestingly the auction duplicates that of the OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H is a bit of a mouthful  think. and seems at odds with the very cautious bidding we have seen from N up to this point. something woke up the dragon|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rado: declarer has easy plan 2Aces + 4 trumps I think|pg||
nt|gluckenval: ah ... :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|bobholl: they should end in w and play @D otherewise made|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rado: trump to 8@H in dummy|pg||
nt|rado: trumps for sure 4-0|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: congratulations to Monaco for a solid win here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|geot: now he should make it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb:  Perhaps small countries have to bid aggressively :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h xfer to @s...with so many values outside of @s suit, passing 1NT is not all that bad.  But, temptation of J109xx suit too much to overcome|pg||
nt|rado: yes trump was killing deffence, |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|frangos007:  a heart lead by S beats 3NT I am told - and perhaps I have overlooked this :)|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|s7|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: cheers than|pg||
nt|henryb:  and there would be some question whether we could die in 4@s or get higher|pg||
nt|offthebend: one good slam and one bad slam -- bid and made --- and gained /lost 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see how many overtricks the leroumain wizard gathers|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes almost the whole world plays it as GF, i cant figure why except for simplicity. but  that also means you  often have to bid 2N with a stiff to invite game|pg||
nt|rado: you may try secondary transfers to combine INV+ and FG hands together:)|pg||
nt|rado: half of the work done|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: most of us would open 1D, so that if they auction goes like this we can say 3C at our third turn|pg||
nt|frangos007:  or the club finesse - either of which works|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: then|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ugis: after the magic 7d I expect a very close score after the first segment|pg||
nt|hedyg: Popov must have expected a better opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: S is a little worried about the spade position here|pg||
nt|ugis: and of course he does not know the hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|ugis: so it will take some time to declare this one - but, as the cards lie, he can not go down|pg||
nt|gmarco24: cheers|pg||
mb|6H|nt|bobholl: tya cu :) operator good job :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H lead and/or switch bloody not now :)|pg||
nt|ritong: apparently my little speech about using stayman to invite did not strike you hard, marshall|pg||
nt|rado: sure:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  again, E takes the low road...the 13hcp with excellent intermediates should make 3N a favorite|pg||
nt|rado: but when you need 46 imps win averything goes:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the last match of this competition|pg||
nt|rado: yes 10 teams round robin now match no.9|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||

nt|henryb:  East had better be glad in the end that declarer is 6-5 and not 5-6|pg||
nt|frangos007:  board 11 was played in 3NT in the OR, as I predicted, and made +2|pg||

mc|12|nt|vugraphzcp: Team Members http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/teams.htm|pg||
nt|ugis: after Lithuania doubled 4s in open room on board 10, even the 7d wont help them to take the lead|pg||
