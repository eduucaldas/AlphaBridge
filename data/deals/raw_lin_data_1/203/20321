nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: easy 4@H to start with |pg||

nt|marlowepi: so far a very standard auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello :) to you too.. welcome|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H not showing length, as N is known to have a strong hand but did not reverse to 2@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: this will be a very routine 5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: the results http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|rado: first blood now , |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has already implied 5 spades but wishes to emphasize the suit due to its quality, and is not crazy about NT with no fit and some potential red- suit problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yeah:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good presume|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|psyck: going for some xruff maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: that may not work well if he loses 2@s, 1@h, 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, his best chance would be to get @d fin right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks to be a dull 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: simple 3 nt with 9 (or 10) tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|danilo1: 8 topp tricks ... but guess any lead by West will find ninth one (difficult to immagine @C lead)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: after 3S, though, the auction sort of petered out. both players have enough to try for slam. N despite the highcard minimum has a super hand with controls and a great suit and his ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: small doubleton in exactly the right place. S has 3 controls and a possible trick source and a potentially useful nine of clubs|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||

nt|bobholl: nice 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not made (yet)|pg||
nt|psyck: not a great game with only 1 entry to dummy & not enough tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@H now is best|pg||
nt|psyck: would often go down even with @h fin on, & no chance here|pg||
nt|rado: 3@S makable and 3@H down one|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently he did try the x ruff & went down as suspected|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on 6@H good save|pg||
nt|bobholl: and a likely push|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of room for differing actions on this  hand, beginning with east's possible opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of options for the auction here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam is of course very playable on the NS cards, and possibly makeable via a squeeze (or pseudo)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzre: that what i see is ..auto squeeze :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: mighty try even 7@D|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone know their 1N range?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: the correct side will start bidding @d soon :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like their  headed to a @S fit|pg||
nt|geot: super fit here for E/W. can make all the tricks in a @H contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see the contract :)|pg||
nt|rado: 2NT is INV only with fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
mb|p!|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
mb|4H|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: seems NS use natural methods, not precision sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a colossally strong hand for a multi in most partnerships, even red|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting opening here|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but.. :) good contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/  updated after round 6. Israel in a very strong position|pg||
pc|sT|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|rado: 5 or 7 hand depending on K@D:)|pg||
nt|geot: In slam - on a club lead, it is on the @D finesse|pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||
nt|rado: trump lead is good for defence but declarer still home with 3@C ruffs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Subhash Gupta|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|h5|nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: lead was easy on the bidding|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|offthebend: hello everybody|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow not best defence|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|vugraphzre: sorry crazy mouse :)|pg||
nt|rado: pessimistic approach by W , many would splinter 3@S |pg||
nt|geot: yes, so might as well be in 7 rather than 6, or just game|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c4|pc|hQ|nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are many situations like this in fourth seat where you want to open but are afraid of being outbid so you open with a preempt which  in last seat is of course not weak. here ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: however that is a questionable strategy, because 2D probably wont keep them out of spades if they have them. meanwhile partner could be something like 4153 and you end in hearts ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps down with  110 or 130 to make in diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi there:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Congrats Marshall!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some sort of record?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You just set a new BBO record: 5 lines of commentary|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: good point :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hihi|pg||
nt|offthebend: is that really a record :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only because the chatspace is so narrow:)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||
nt|othered1: best defense likely would have started by south leading the long suit |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|granguru:  claim time already|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: not sure about this line, as opposed to setting up a diamond, but with right view in hearts D wont be needed|pg||

mb|1D|nt|granguru:  a small @c first improuves a little defense options|pg||

mb|1H|nt|othered1: Not quite a 2@C bid, because  you run out of rebids pretty quickly|pg||
nt|phil: yes, declarer gets a good count on the hand when the 3rd diamond is played. I do think its stronger for North to duck that heart though, don;t you think? |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: BRAVE 1 NT BY e|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: the results after round 3 3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some like sandwich NT (for other suits) & some like nat NT (since opps often open & respond light & steal you blind)...|pg||
nt|othered1: 7 is an excellent spot and may be biddable.  |pg||
nt|rado: W might use garbage stayman here |pg||

mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: 3N by W looks good as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||

nt|marlowepi: S had not an obvious pass for some of us|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes a 53 major suit fit is not the key to the city. here 5C is a much more comfortable spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy it looks like W can get home, but there is work to be done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as the cards lie, even 6C is more comfortable than 4S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has every reason to think long and carefully here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though soon we may start wondering if the screen door has been raised:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: on their way to 7 i guess|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by W is only cold game, but 5C could easily succeed|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5C can be beaten only on S ruff now |pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck:  I play 1@s by E as 4+ cards & x with less|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now making as crucial entry got|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and this is not that hard..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
nt|othered1: This would be a v ery easy Blue Team Club auction, where south would show an ace and a king on his first response, then @H fit, then cue-bidding should focus on t he value of the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @SQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of chances for it though. ace of hearts lead will set it, or spade ace then heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of chances to set i mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: one down or two down ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one|pg||
pc|s8|nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
nt|geot: Not so many top-tricks here, will have to work well to get 9|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@S-7@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller would reach this surely with their tarzan precision|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: N will cash heart ace to get a signal|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2, when S ruff..back @H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like NS play upside down then|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if s still interested N has an easy 7 @H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: well done..|pg||
nt|henryb:  Whatever the bids meant, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while,  Bye for now.|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and play will present no problem with @S 32|pg||

nt|henryb:  Palazo is a player after my own style, not opening that dreadful 12 count|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: quick pass :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck:  need more than that|pg||
nt|bobholl: you can subract 1 point for 4333 and one for aceless agree totally|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no way for any different lead i think|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4H can be made even on a S shift after 2 Diamonds |pg||
nt|offthebend: H to 9 forces the Q out -- and then H can be drawn later |pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: I may have preferred some number of @c instead of the negative 1@d on the Strong @c opening|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is perhaps less objectionable if playing multi|pg||

nt|psyck:  you have 3 @c's in hand to take care of|pg||

nt|henryb:  Should E open? I do not think so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, 1@h double a good idea at the vul & with passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the real criterion in such decisions is: if we do push the opps to 5H, are they likely to go down? if not, less attractoive to save, esp with 2 likely defensiove tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder how many pairs have 4@h to play in this situation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, i said that inside it:):(|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i will|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  The shape is awkward. If he was 4-0-5-4 I think there is more of a case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because his hand also makes a ten trick game look a bit distant|pg||
nt|offthebend: I would have liked to have at least the H10 before bidding 3NT -- but south though his HQ may help |pg||
mb|3C|nt|zebutin: yes...i must admit i couldn't have passed with Wests hand|pg||
nt|rado: 1@C balanced or @C or any FG, 1@D TRF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as it would have if E had held the heart king|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: do you like N's dbl?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: just ask..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: some would overcall 1@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not at all, but sometimes we all make bids we dont like because we have to bid and everything else looks even less appetizing|pg||
nt|offthebend: should N not buid 3D with Qx and wait for S to try 3H or 3S on the way to looking for best spot |pg||
nt|geot: E/W may not get in at all here, and can not be blamed, really?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobholl: 5@H is cheap |pg||
nt|marlowepi: not ao cheap if opps bid 6D|pg||
nt|phil: 1 looks sort of obvious to me even if you play wide ranging preempts|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H goes for 800 so better pass :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that D by N. maybe 4H is better, planning to correct spades to NT for minors|pg||
nt|phil: with a void heart, its unlikely the w/r opponents are bidding 4@h, so maybe the mild overbid of 4N is best? |pg||
nt|phil: *likely|pg||
nt|phil: I think East will get away with 5@h here if he bids it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: inside out|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  4@h looks like a better contract than 3NT.|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry even 6@H goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|rado: 1@h was quite normal overcall I think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck:  4@h could make even if you get trumps wrong|pg||
nt|bobholl: only objection against double is only 3 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like any plan that strongly emphasizes the minors, as pd is likely to have a fit. i think the double was based on the fear that S had 18 balanced and that 3N was the only game. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: narrow target to try to hit|pg||
mb|d|nt|skjaeran:  Can discard a spade on clubs.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 3@D would be forcing, ! would choose 3@D rather than jump to 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  right lead found|pg||
nt|offthebend: I never double with that hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: many perhaps wondering why S did not raise diamonds. the answer must be that NS play "equal level conversion"|pg||
nt|rado: good shape, quick tricks...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|psyck: 2@h must have shown an intermediate hand with 5@h & W was not interested in game opp less than strong @c opening values|pg||
nt|zebutin: and some might even bid with Easts hand something like balancing 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I can understand E not bidding as he expects vul opps to be in a misfit as pd did not x 1@h|pg||
nt|gmarco24: rare to see the first level competition  :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|geot: E/W has a nice heart contract. Third board in a row a heart fit is not found, and no-one has really done anything silly |pg||
nt|geot: yes, Rado...a 1H overcall would have worked nicely|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rado: 4@s has good chances restricting losers to trump and 2@h|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck:  transfer to maj & bidding minor is gf for most|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psyck: so asystemic gain for Slovakia|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim button|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  Although I think it is scary to volunteer a three card suit, Muranli did well to steer partner to a @s lead|pg||
nt|rado: and 5@D also makable|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|danilo1: 4@H much better contract than 3NT |pg||
nt|psyck: *E was not...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i vote for @s now, but he might play 3 rounds of @d|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|geot: but only four card suit, and red ag green....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: as kit woolsey has repeatedly emphasized, we shouldnt automatically shy away from a takeout double when there is just one reply that will make us unhappy -- why assume partner will ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: always make that bid. most hands are about fits, and the opps dont have a heart fit probably so maybe their fit is in clubs and a double will find our fit for us|pg||

nt|andyv:  a lot of pressure on E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes you have to stick it out there|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: or 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: what do u prefer|pg||
nt|alnanda: ......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a 3D opening by W (not that i recommend it) would almost surely briung a huge reward on this deal|pg||
nt|rado: Seniors will bid 2 I think:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: do we know how many countries participating in this event?|pg||
nt|bobholl: with this @C position 3nt no problem too :)|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
nt|andyv:  you don't get dealt that good of @s suit to pass in these situations|pg||
nt|frangos007:  2@H by S very risk at this vuln imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: nice R:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  but you were right, Marshall....the vul got to E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i just bid in these situations, despite the dangers, and somehow it rarely works out disastrously. often it is -100 vs +50 but that is a fleabite|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but with some serious thinking..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: long i mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D is perhaps not available to them as a natural preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  now trying to recover - this might be costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznq: on TGRs behalf I'd like to thank... ROLAND (for being helpful and supporting)@H@H@H... ALL COMMENTATORS (for making this event more interesting)@H@H@H Thank you all for your time ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
nt|danilo1: East hand on limit to make slam try in @C ... and West's one on limit to accept it ... together - slam danger |pg||
nt|granguru:  3@D is a slam invitation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has a whopper of a 1N bid. 2C worth considering as alternative|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has a nasty guess between the majors but he gambled rigth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NV i would endorse 3D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: if 3@D is transfer  worth 4@H ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N with good @h support and no @c stopper|pg||
nt|rado: 11 tricks for NS , unless EW cash theyr @D |pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  4@s is a sensible contract, just needing the @hA onside. It isn't.|pg||

pc|h5|nt|blewah: thanks, Krishna|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might even go down 2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|granguru:  thats why W is considering ..|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H positive response|pg||
nt|granguru:  probably in 1 minor|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  EW is not a regular partnership. Hope they know what they're doing now.|pg||
nt|granguru:  not known|pg||
nt|psyck:  Other room E knew pd had 4 carder @h with likely some wastage, after kickback revealed an ace missing, maybe should stop in game with min hand|pg||
nt|offthebend: pretty timid bidding all around :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d may have just been a 2nd relay, G|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|henryb:  This should be 12 imps to Luxenbourg, which will essentially tie the match|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has to lead a @C in time but i guess he will |pg||
nt|henryb:  BTW, is there a website for standings?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|granguru:  4@H no @d control|pg||
nt|granguru:  only a @d lead permits to win|pg||
nt|psyck:  i've no idea what the bids mean here, but looks like they knew what they meant to do|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|bobholl: there is i guess but don't know whre|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|zebutin: now little easier, but if they drive @S A down, you must feel little uneasy that @C finese isn't actually working|pg||
nt|zebutin: even if it works for the 1st time you take it that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: where|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might try to find @CJ with west|pg||
nt|rado: yes if W starts with DBL|pg||
pc|sA|nt|granguru:  made!|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure if they had this option (lot of partnerships use it) - but if possible, better would be to transfer in @C and show slam try with @H single/void ... West would than ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably not accept|pg||
nt|frangos007:  to limit to -1|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: S leads the 9 to feign a singleton, but with only 2 in dummy W is not likely to panic. here of course it  didntmatter|pg||

nt|frangos007:  another very interesting hand|pg||
nt|ugis: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|psyck: NS will go down in some contract here i suppose|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless you have 2 timid rabbits sitting E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: auction might not go the same early|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 6@H in east is the optimum contract :)|pg||
nt|blewah: both pairs play big club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3Dmaking is likely outcome|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the trick is to stay only in 4@S|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia has taken an early lead here|pg||
nt|rado: slam in @C|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|psyck: luckily not possible to misguess @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW bid to 4@s, I think it's a good chance NS will go to 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 6NT also....|pg||
nt|blewah: exclusion rkcb now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@D voidwood would be pretty now |pg||
nt|blewah: 5@d|pg||
nt|blewah: or yes 4@d, depending on their agreement|pg||
nt|bobholl: why 1 @S 3rd hand a multi or weak two looks better|pg||
mb|2C!|an|15-17 BAL|nt|marlowepi: 1H ? why not X ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not my call but might find the 4-4 fit for whatever value it has here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless that shows 64 in S/H respectively, it seems eccentric|pg||
nt|rado: here 1@C is 15+ bal or @C or any FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 4@H no aces and the optimum contract in the best hand :)|pg||
nt|rado: mean grand at 52 cards but probably 6@S will see|pg||
mb|2N|nt|blewah: 2@h is normal, slower road|pg||
nt|bobholl: although this migth work out better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 3@C now may be|pg||
nt|offthebend: strong C auction -- is this 2NT forcing by Hristov ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and is GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it should be|pg||
nt|geot: 15+9 HCPs. With some good guessing game is possible|pg||
nt|rado: 1NT is bal FG or some other options|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  South asking for trouble |pg||

nt|vugraphznq: ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: anyone for 2@C NV vs. voul |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 in hand is the threat but in that case Nwould have played @SK to kill the squeeze|pg||

nt|bobholl: now double in N ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't understand either|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract, however, is normal enough|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4NT is for the minors, which after the takeout double usually promising 4@H, shows a void in spades|pg||
nt|ugis: probably N could have bid smth over 3c..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: was alerted like GF|pg||
nt|rado: 4@D will make the things easy now|pg||
nt|offthebend: why not 2NT over 2H -- to show balanced GF and H stopper ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hristov explain that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps a multi-way bid, including a lebensohl variant|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|an|4!S|nt|bobholl: and s 3@S now ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  N might double this, expecting strength from partner|pg||

nt|henryb:  what, I wonder, is 3@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: strong :):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but the colour...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Where I come from it shows a solid suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  not AJxxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Whatever, but I think Ulugol owed his partner 5@h, not 4 with the good trump support|pg||
nt|offthebend: correct |pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably because it wouldnt mean that|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they havent really unearthed much of a fit yet, so i think 5H would be a bit of an exaggeration|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@D likes @Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: with 2nt he denide 5 colour suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am wondering why N passed over 1C:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes of course, but couldnt E bid 4D with a hand that was not as good as this one as dummy for spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: and show balancing hand|pg||

nt|frangos007:  this should make|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: henri|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting now..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: may be Tanev dont understand 2nt |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: like strong hand (positive)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, when i said that 5H might be a bit too much, i certainly didnt mean that the alternative was a mere 4S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|henryb:  2N, in my world, says two places to play|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am quite sure that there is a mild confusion here -- W thinks 2NT is limited |pg||
nt|geot: 4@S is the contract ...if you want to be in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 4@S..|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: me and my partner would have done not that good on this one 1nt 2@C and than 4@H :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even so, why not 4H?|pg||
nt|ritong: by east|pg||
nt|ritong: establishing @ss for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could E have: Txx   JTxx  AQx   QJx ?|pg||
nt|offthebend: if 2NT is limited with some H stopper and D A -- he needs too much to look for a slam |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i think E should realized , his p dont understand 2nt like a positive.. and try to bid something else then PASS|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||
nt|rado: probably some sort of Lebensohl situation cue= denies|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i doubt, since then 3@s would promise 4@h. weird, i don't know really|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Zipovski is well known as "i play 2 conventions partner!" when he plays with unknown partner|pg||
nt|henryb:  RKC - 1KC, |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes, i hope so|pg||
nt|henryb:  Do you have the @hQ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see now the bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|geot: The trumps works fine, but he needs to guess the club situation|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: may be i direct 4/5 @D would agree @S :(|pg||
nt|henryb:  I assume 2@d showed some values and 2@h would have been an immediate double negative|pg||
nt|ritong: hum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on what grounds could E recognize that?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|blewah: yes, that would be the intention too|pg||
nt|frangos007:  going for the possible overtrick?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  trying to discard losing club if @HA is with North, perhaps|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i think the bidding makes clear the @SK is with N and he should have tackled trumps immediately|pg||
nt|frangos007:  it's all down to getting the trumps right|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ugis: only diamond ruffs beat 4 spades|pg||
nt|geot: @C switch now?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: assuming that part has not understood a bid looks unhealthy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blewah: W just wanted to knoe keycards in @s excluding in @d|pg||
nt|frangos007:  this might help declarer now to make +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 5@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Q+K@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but i dont see the queen :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ulugol may have assumed thaat the third heart was the equivalent of the Q opposite partner's 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: i guess..|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am betting on 510 though :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|blewah: *know|pg||
nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer should lead the @hJ next|pg||
nt|frangos007:  playing @D for him|pg||
nt|henryb:  I sure would, although I would have been wondering what partner's suit was for 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: me 2.. may be he is thinking abt AJ10xxxx..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 7th|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzre: 3@h IS a serious bid..|pg||
nt|henryb:  can declarer afford to safety play hearts?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|geot: diamond back was as good|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  N should play @h toward the Q|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|frangos007:  wd|pg||
nt|frangos007:  now +1|pg||
nt|geot: ruff now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well done!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|henryb:  that is cash the A, then lead towards dummy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: not enough.. :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  W is known to have the K@h|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|offthebend: yayyyyy|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzre: now easy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Karaivanov is killing declarer with "always @s" return whenever he is in trick|pg||
pc|s9|nt|skjaeran:  A few IMPs for de Botton on the last board. Congrats to the winners: Esterson|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|nt|bobholl: has to guess @C for 2@H making :)|pg||
nt|phil: has good count now|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

nt|zebutin: would be sad to bid 6@H after 4/5@D and see partner change it to 6@S...|pg||
nt|blewah: ow, that would be sad|pg||
nt|psyck: he should have set suit with 3@h on 2@d as suggested, then had enough options|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @hs 3-2, no hard done|pg||
nt|gmarco24: also, one of the points where beginners usually go wrong - trying to ruff with long trumps|pg||
nt|rado: yes nevermind declarers or defence:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think that even if E is limited W can bid 4H. Couldnt E still have something like:  Txx   QTxx   AQJx   xx, or even a bit more  ?|pg||
nt|geot: Actually diamond back was much better than club switch, sorry....on a club switch declarer could have won the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 6@S 7@D ??|pg||
nt|rado: now danger for EW|pg||
nt|rado: if old "penalty dbl " after preempt applied|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|ugis: pass?|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: bit strong for a NV 2@H isn't it ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how do you guess the singleton @D as east ??|pg||
nt|bobholl: he just tries to get the contract cheap :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  @s is a strange (to my eyes) choice|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he does|pg||
nt|ritong: is leroumain a BBO username, dessy?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|phil: tempting to pass with those club tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt looks sound enough but on a @S lead not that good :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 2h = weak 2, 5 card suit possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|blewah: setting up @h suit and assume captaincy with a void is usually tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: on any lead but small @D at least 1 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to go wrong here|pg||
nt|ugis: 8 tricks if they manage to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: the bidding and the contract:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: they wants their usernames in here|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: so we have the famous cornel teodorescu on stage|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobholl: 3@S a good tactical choice |pg||
nt|phil: yep|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c should be forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may opt for 2@s or 4@h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobholl: 7@D goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  especially since it does not clue partner in at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Zipovski's p may be doesnt know that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: now N is in danger from his partner  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  3N could be in trouble with the @c break|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: which is why i suggested that W should give up chances of grand & settle for the practical way to reach 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: east afraid of his weak @S i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: still OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If you were going to bid 4@s, why not bid 4@c on the way?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  both sides have done well to control the bidding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Harald Skjæran and Danilo Stojanovic|pg||
nt|bobholl: so far for good tactics :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contrary to expectations, 4S failed in the other room on  19, so Montenegro lost 4 instead of gaining 9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H sort of a practical call, though once in a while you miss a slam|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Dessy, he might say some things after this board, try to inform us :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: very good @D Q keeps communication and not a ruff yet :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: he already did it|pg||
nt|gmarco24: oh boy  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: dbl was penn..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but very calm|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: and to CK|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck:  e.g. a @s lead duck all around would probably beat 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 100 better than -180 but 140 is better|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: it worked in the end :)|pg||
nt|geot: E/W over board here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|blewah: yes, practical bid is a good one if you haven't discussed science with p|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: after 2@d-3@h-3@s cue- he still has option of exclusion key card ask of 5@d|pg||
nt|ritong: they are not overenterprising, are they?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|frangos007:  3@H not the easiest of contracts - this will need to be played well|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frangos007:  but cards are kindly placed for declarer|pg||
pc|dT|nt|skjaeran:  Nice defence by north|pg||
pc|s2|nt|offthebend: another slam bit the dust on the same lead |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rado: shift J and Q @S and 3NT is ok, now no game:(|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|skjaeran:  Established communications to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: even if S did not want to bid 2@h on 1@h other table (in case it showed better hand?) he should have bid it on 1@S|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|zebutin: yes i think on previous deal you easily can find 7 if you have that in cards, if you start with 3@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|frangos007:  W might have tried to get her ruff|pg||
nt|frangos007:  in spades, but perhaps she expects to make her @SQ anyway|pg||
nt|frangos007:  declarer now worried about repeated club forces|pg||
nt|frangos007:  so not easy to draw last trump|pg||
nt|frangos007:  he might easily lose complete control and end up several down|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|geot: I dont mind 1@S from E too much, although many would probably pass|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|gmarco24: a few evenings ago he said to him:"if you are not sure, keep the bidding alive. first rule!"|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, i guess, Koldzic is just sticking to the first rule|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Rumen was surpriced on 3@H bid :)|pg||
nt|rado: we are happy they missed to discussed what dbl was, but next Opponents wil not have that chance:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ugis: E should have signalled the spade A, looks like he did not. Far from the best defence by E - diamond ruff also rather obvious|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|offthebend: Henri , would you bid 3S by N ?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psyck:  Declarer just hoping for @s44 or some such fav lie of cards|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@h here is pretty normal, i think but i don't know about W's pass|pg||
nt|ritong: aceless  annoying|pg||
nt|ritong: or almost|pg||
nt|ritong: many jacks|pg||
nt|offthebend: yes but 4th trump :)|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: Not sure what the redouble shows for them here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  well, it was a very small chance anyway, but the correct play would have been to play the @SK and hope to pin the Q|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobholl: system with 2@D as multi or MF could reach 6@H in east |pg||
nt|geot: I would have bid myself as East, that is for sure, and played in game :(|pg||
mc|8|nt|rado: if no 1@S then W would DBL again 2@D and now another test for E how many @S to bid|pg||

nt|bobholl: seeing 52 cards is always easier :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N SHOULD BE EASY|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another possible pickup for montenegro, if they can bid and make 6H in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after failing in 4S they may well do so|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ritong: i would settle for low road|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  a tricky hand with points fairly evenly distributed and no strong distributions|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, i invite differently as responder|pg||
nt|ritong: via stayman|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2S. a jump to 3S should be 6 Losing Trick Count|pg||
nt|rado: 2@c here is 15-17 P natural|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bobholl: poor n has to find a bid |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 nt would be my choice|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N perhaps?|pg||
nt|bobholl: same choice |pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s possible but unattractive on that suit|pg||
nt|phil: nice fit here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  on these hands you always feel good about making your contract, especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|geot: Can make 6@C on the spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: in 4 spades declarer will have to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: so, 2@h is either nada or gf|pg||
nt|geot: but not likely to reach it?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|danilo1: excellent by N ... he knew by the lead declarer max single @S ... to note - @SK would lead to 3NT made ... since than time for declarer to establish 3 @H tricks |pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C suffers from bad finesses|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c now|pg||
nt|zebutin: East did the disciplined thing by passing twice...i might have been tempted to bid 2@S at some point...sad to admit... :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass?????????|pg||
nt|bobholl: is that a suit ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of lost oppirtunities in this match...on  14 NS here missed a 5D slam....only to win 6 when  opps in other room didnt get beyond 3D|pg||
nt|frangos007:  aggressive double by West|pg||
nt|offthebend: bd 7 -- 2Dx got converted in open troom on another misunderstanding and gained 3 imps :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S really has nothing more to say|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mathat: 3 nt and 5 1c only|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if you pass the S  hand which is defendable|pg||
nt|phil: wouldnt occur to me to open that South trash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt occur to me to pass at these colors:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would open but with an 11-13 NT :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N would seem to be holding a textbook responsive double here|pg||
nt|ugis: might missguess now - it is more likely that N has the A of diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: therefore, superaccepts are differently considered|pg||
nt|rado: 2NT was pup to 3@C with several meanings|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strange lead if P couldn't bid 1 @S |pg||
nt|henryb:  a strange lead given that partner could not make a negative double |pg||
nt|andyv:  but the vul is right|pg||
mb|3H|an|alerted|nt|frangos007:  this is now pushing E/W into dangerous territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  great commenters think alike|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: they discuss that .. Rumen will not pass 2@Sx - will bid 2nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: he has 17hcp|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|skjaeran:  Not the worst of slams, but should stop below the 6-level.|pg||
nt|mathat: 4 @c mb|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3C was forcing|pg||
nt|ugis: and it takes some nerves for S to play small diamond twice :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that is a good method for structuring the status of superaccepts|pg||
nt|ritong: well, the (relatively)new ideas about the way to invite impact some|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  West far too aggressive for me|pg||
nt|rado: DBL of 2@C could be misleading here since he has another good suit  suppose partner had only Kxxx(x) in @H|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|blewah: i would have entered in the 2nd chance too, Seppo|pg||
nt|psyck: it is a good slam, should be bid both rooms|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N dicing with death|pg||
nt|bobholl: in @C only 4 :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  almost certainly one down, might be more|pg||
nt|frangos007:  difficult for declarer to guess the heart queen correctly, after this bidding|pg||
nt|rado: this time N has natural lead @D:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobholl: 2 entries to the @D now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is betting as though his majors were  xx    Axxx|pg||
nt|offthebend: there are other ways to super accept -- 3M is basically 4-cards and minimum -- may be with some prime cards like Ace and K in side suit/s|pg||
nt|ritong: i am not saying it is a revolution, i say that one has to review this stuff if inviting via stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  but might get the trumps right|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck:  good slam in fact, need little more than one of the fin working |pg||
nt|bobholl: should yes but will ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: again N refuses to bid 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: to pass|pg||
nt|ugis: N should play A and 10, not K|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|phil: I thought South was endplayed into it|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  I'm told 2NT asked for aces.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3nt is so often superior to 5 of a minor and not only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  value of trump switch is non existent...S needed to make an attacking move|pg||
nt|ugis: so that declarer places hK with S|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe West can sort out Easts distribution here, but can he find out about both the AKs?|pg||
nt|geot: wow|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: @S lead and 1 down :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have never really gotten the point of superaccepting with a minimum, even at IMPs, just because you have four trumps. why go out of your way to convert a plus to a minus when ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: partner is weak?|pg||
nt|rado: not sure but seemed 3@D was asking and 3@H @S singleton, and 4@D cue|pg||
nt|geot: On a diamond lead he would have had 12 already scoring the J, without a diamond lead it is a 50/50 slam, and it works:) |pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: yes, several chances, none of which work here|pg||
nt|psyck: except @d lead :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E had no real reason to double 3S, which only gives more options to NS. on this auction W was already going to  lead a spade eevn with a void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i understand the 2H rebid by S in context, but there is something wrong when one has to rebid the same 5332 nothing hand to avoid defending. N should have bid|pg||
nt|frangos007:  now now :(|pg||
pc|h7|nt|skjaeran:  By a reliable source|pg||
nt|granguru:  so 2@c must be a relay according @h|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|frangos007:  not now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|skjaeran:  3NT asked for cuebids|pg||
nt|bobholl: will try to ruff out @H Q and than @D finesse :)|pg||
nt|ugis: sorry, 10 tricks allways :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|frangos007:  he might have tested North by trying the @HJ instead|pg||
nt|frangos007:  he should have developed hearts anyway, trying to limit his spade losers|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru:  i would guess 2@d is a bal hand|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  3H=2 without Q|pg||
nt|granguru:  3n IS A NEW ASKING|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk on 5@D ... Sould shoud bid slam (or 5@S) ... already shown no slam interest before|pg||
nt|psyck: @h drop, @d fin, squeeze, all in vain|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree...and N's silence makes it difficult if not impossible for S to find the right switch|pg||
nt|ugis: thought he has a spade loser :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|bobholl: guess this is a 70% slam or so|pg||

nt|frangos007:  this was risky but declarer escaped lightly|pg||
nt|henryb:  An easy 3N for N-S|pg||
nt|ritong: depends also if your suit is @hs or @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: preempting with @ss is pessimistic|pg||
nt|geot: Vito found the 6-4 heart fit on board 4 N/S, and scored a double game swing (15 imps)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|frangos007:  2@D might have made anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|gmarco24: good defence, they understand each other|pg||
nt|rado: here some auction expected|pg||
nt|offthebend: I agree with that 100% -- with spades , you do have some freedom :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes they may make it, but they havent bid it yet, and are not at all likely to if vul, and if they are nonvul they usually feel the risk -reward ratio does not favor bidding as you ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: may have only a 7 card fit|pg||
nt|ritong: since, 90% of the time, if they balance, they will let you alone in 3@s|pg||
mb|2N!|an|!H+!D|nt|bobholl: the necessaty of 3@C is not clear to me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: 2@C precision style|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: which is still a good enough % to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: ew not precision ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4@S by West is makeable, but need to get the clubs right or develop clubs before diamond tricks need to be lost|pg||
mb|4C|nt|psyck: 2@d multi & 3@h pass/correct I presume (I prefer 3@s to 3@h)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is this an upgrade to 15 - 17 or within range|pg||
nt|rado: now 2@D or simple 1M?|pg||
nt|ritong: if they balance over 2@s that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  bad spade break makes the hand not easy to handle|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might get 3NT here|pg||
nt|ugis: one of the boards where either 5 or 7 diamonds can be made :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|zebutin: maybe polish club or something...?|pg||
nt|blewah: i think they did|pg||
nt|frangos007:  which always makes|pg||
nt|rado: and 11-14 p |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If its 14-16, South should surely have passed|pg||
nt|bobholl: no slam interest and don't tell opponents too much |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N conservatism works here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  I do not agree with 3@H - should be practical - West has indicated a minimum opening hand|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i really do not understand what he is considering|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the 3NT bid is automatic, imo|pg||
nt|offthebend: flip side to that when pard is some 5-5 ( M+m) -- he may not move with 7-8 points over a simple rebid of 2M by the opener |pg||
nt|ritong: hey radoslav, you caught three motormouths  poor priateliu:)|pg||
nt|geot: Can E/W make 5@D here? I dont think so, but it is close|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: 3@c was an overbid, S expected more with pd|pg||
nt|psyck: ya, i assumed strong @c when i saw Bd 20|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mildly astonishing 10-IMP gain for Montenegro on  20 when NS in other room did not reach 4S. S had a super hand for spades but underbid it  drastically|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobholl: guess a strange upgrade|pg||
nt|rado: down 2 wil not be good for EW with easy 3NT|pg||
nt|gmarco24: let's see if there is -3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ugis: 7 because partner denied cue bids in H and C?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|frangos007:  ah well :)|pg||
nt|geot: trump switch is best, I think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|frangos007:  perhaps he likes to make his partner work for it :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: Interestingly the auction duplicates that of the OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H is a bit of a mouthful  think. and seems at odds with the very cautious bidding we have seen from N up to this point. something woke up the dragon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rado: declarer has easy plan 2Aces + 4 trumps I think|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bobholl: they should end in w and play @D otherewise made|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rado: trump to 8@H in dummy|pg||
nt|rado: trumps for sure 4-0|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: congratulations to Monaco for a solid win here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|geot: now he should make it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps small countries have to bid aggressively :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h xfer to @s...with so many values outside of @s suit, passing 1NT is not all that bad.  But, temptation of J109xx suit too much to overcome|pg||
nt|rado: yes trump was killing deffence, |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|frangos007:  a heart lead by S beats 3NT I am told - and perhaps I have overlooked this :)|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|frangos007:  there we go|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: there are methods that encourage partner to invite with that hand type. for example, play 3 of a minor after a transfer as INV +|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|frangos007:  back to getting the clubs right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: j@H trumped small @C trumped no problem|pg||

mb|p|nt|frangos007:  2NT ?|pg||
nt|ugis: thx|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: now contemplating 4nt at this vulnarabilty ?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd act, short of @S, probably overcalling 3@H.  Partners are ready for very aggressive action with shortness  in  their suit|pg||
nt|rado: good have a nice lunch:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bobholl: he 's got 21/2 @H imo so double and than 2@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|zebutin: making 9 tricks it seems, when Qx in diamonds drops|pg||
nt|psyck: thx all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  but the final contract is correct|pg||
nt|henryb:  At my table the auction would go 1@c-1@d-1N-2@s-3@s-4@c-4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: ty :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: got lucky in the lead here, there were several other better spots to play in|pg||
nt|bobholl: he will lead @C now against 5@D :)|pg||
nt|frangos007:  with diamonds breaking favourably, declarer should make, though his hand is short of entries|pg||
nt|frangos007:  but he might try winning in dummy and playing three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: cheers than|pg||
nt|henryb:  and there would be some question whether we could die in 4@s or get higher|pg||
nt|offthebend: one good slam and one bad slam -- bid and made --- and gained /lost 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see how many overtricks the leroumain wizard gathers|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes almost the whole world plays it as GF, i cant figure why except for simplicity. but  that also means you  often have to bid 2N with a stiff to invite game|pg||
nt|rado: you may try secondary transfers to combine INV+ and FG hands together:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: most of us would open 1D, so that if they auction goes like this we can say 3C at our third turn|pg||
nt|frangos007:  or the club finesse - either of which works|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: then|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ugis: after the magic 7d I expect a very close score after the first segment|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ugis: S is a little worried about the spade position here|pg||
nt|ugis: and of course he does not know the hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|ugis: so it will take some time to declare this one - but, as the cards lie, he can not go down|pg||
nt|gmarco24: cheers|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobholl: tya cu :) operator good job :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H lead and/or switch bloody not now :)|pg||
nt|ritong: apparently my little speech about using stayman to invite did not strike you hard, marshall|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  again, E takes the low road...the 13hcp with excellent intermediates should make 3N a favorite|pg||
