nt|baldjean: hello all|pg||
nt|andyv:  and hi Li, our operator|pg||
nt|andyv:  a healthy 3@d call by N will put S to the test|pg||
nt|baldjean: 5@d makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know how to pronounce the player names, but at least I can spell them :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d can be made|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North is Fu Zhong I am told|pg||
nt|baldjean: @h split well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a world class player who used to play with Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|andyv:  and @d suit behaves|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 tricks, S should just bid 5@ds|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @c suit should be the pusher|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hope we are not stuck|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|twcho: west is a bit aggressive to bid to a thin game at bd 1 and went down inevitably |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  borderline invitational but the K@d is a big asset|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: NS is playing precision judging from bd 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|twcho: Precision is probably the prevailing system in China|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: 3 @C was precarious  for sure |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @S not easy either |pg||
nt|sybarra: leading a @D might have worked better but may be time if ht played too early |pg||
nt|sybarra: as stated,  maybe @D works better for the ruff,  but no way to tell that given the bidding |pg||
nt|sybarra: we may be stuck again|pg||
nt|sybarra: operator more problems?|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for EW, the wrong party is on lead...N has an easy @h lead and should be able to signal for a @c switch|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  or more|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gracelin: both tables found the good sacrifice.  NS can make 7C but hard to be confident on the Grand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if he plays to make contract, it will be down 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  not vul, the penalty is not as severe if W tries to make this |pg||
pc|dK|nt|twcho: the @c position is the most favorable possible for declarer|pg||
nt|twcho: but declarer doesn't know about it|pg||

pc|h5|nt|twcho: and he guesses the trump|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  so now, 9 tricks for the defense unless S feels obligated to part with a @c on the run of @hs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|gracelin: This match is from group C.  Beijing Xinyuan is leading the group and Shi Ji Chang Da still has chance to qualify.|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi Shirley|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: nice prize money |pg||

nt|gracelin: This is the 5th match of the round robin.  The 32 teams field are divided into 4 groups.  The top teams from each group will qualify for the finals.|pg||
nt|twcho: a possible grand|pg||
nt|twcho: and a very good small slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably one major|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|andyv:  catching up on boards...on 2, EW took their obvious 4 tricks and then E probably ruffed a @c with his stiff K@d|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gracelin: top 2 teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: let's see where they'll finish|pg||
nt|twcho: minor slam is more difficult to bid because of the space constraints|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gracelin: East 3NT is everybody's bid but he bought a poor dummy here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: South has a minimum but very good supporting hand for his partner|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @H usually a good spade raise |pg||
nt|gracelin: The whole field of 32 teams are divided into 4 groups.  This match is from group A, what is called the VIP group.|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting on board 2, EW got very active and bid to 4@s making|pg||
nt|andyv:  a decent slam missed in either minor and NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: and W will convert|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Göran Sperber|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gracelin: yes, 3H is a genuine invitation while a raise to 3S is defined as a Courtesy raise.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|gracelin: The total prize money for this invitational event is around US$68,000.  Winner alone will get about US$20,000|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|gsper:  Is everybody playing Precision here?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: just a bit unlucky here |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|twcho: north didn't manage to find out the information he wants but he gamble that there will be good chance to produce the 13 tricks he needs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: This tournament is sponsored solely by Nan Gang Done Li , a power company in Guandong.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Goran and Roland|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|gracelin: The sponsor of Beijing Xinyuan, Mr. RQ Lin is playing in other room.  His team is not leading group C. |pg||

nt|gracelin: south found a good lead, if he led his partner's suit, H, 4S might make.|pg||
nt|baldjean: with 5/5 in majors I can understand they became active. East's hand is upgraded a lot if there isd a fit and even more so if there is a double fit|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|gsper:  This board does not promise much drama either.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ni hao: welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks like precision auction |pg||
nt|twcho: east can bid 3@h (must be forcing) or 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Yes, Shirley, they are competing with Mr. Yeh.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and poor E has virtually nothing |pg||
nt|gracelin: You will see lot of Precision actions in this tournament, I guess more than 60% of Chinese players play Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I recall from other vugraphs  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I must say I play with many chinese players on bbo,  and they play an excellent 2/1 game also!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (since I do not play precision) |pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, you need to know natural system well to also play well with Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hates to balance and find the next bid to be 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: but he knows pard has some point given the E bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: *points|pg||
nt|gracelin: this East hand worth a 2S raise in the way I play, but no harm is done.|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you mostly play precision, Patrick?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  N believes Qx of @s is a stopper|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|gracelin: Ths is the 2nd match of the RR from group C.  Both teams have won their first match.|pg||
nt|gsper:  N had no quite satisfactory bid.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 1NT overcall does lead to an easy 3NT bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  o tricks with the @s and just playing for overtricks...these are the times partners get upset if you go down:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|twcho: This is the 1st segment of the quarter final|pg||
nt|twcho: losing team will go into the Swiss Teams event while the winner will advance to the semi|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jiang in south here play for China Open team last year at the PABF in New Zealand.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: Mr. Gua, sitting north here, is the boss of the automibile company.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW, Sun and Kang are member of China open team many years ago.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sun made his name known in the semi-final match against Italy in the 2004 Olympiad.  Sun and Kang also reached semi-final in the 2011 Vanderbilt in the Spring NABC.|pg||
nt|baldjean: 6nt actually make here, but they won't be bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  that doesn't look right|pg||
nt|gracelin: He and Zhang play natural, including 16-18 1NT.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C seems to be part of the 2-way check back.  2C for invitational hand and 2D for GF.|pg||
nt|twcho: with @h breaking, declarer can enter dummy with the 3rd @H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: north has no reason to go on.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|twcho: Winner of main event will get 120,000 RMB prize money. The winner of the Swiss Teams also gets 50,000 RMB|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|twcho: NS are current China national team members and they will soon go to Eindhoven of Netherlands to compete in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|twcho: their CC can be found here: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/China/li-liu.pdf|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: remember, his 1NT rebid could be as many as 15 CP|pg||
nt|gracelin: HCP|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  probably best to duck here|pg||
nt|twcho: and make certain of his contract|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: the lead is helpful.  declarer may only lose 2S + 2D for his contract.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he needs to handle well and guess everything.|pg||
nt|gracelin: running the D7 will be a good start.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|twcho: this is probably not the best line|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: low spade also works well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  taking A@s and E must find the Q of @c|pg||
nt|twcho: but South has dicarded too many @s |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|gracelin: How could East raise his passed hand partner to game is a little surprising.  He also has wasted honors in club.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: Sun obviously has length in Heart so East seems to have an unsuitable hand for partner.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this case, not a problem|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|twcho: so probably not enough winner to set declarer|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  but if S had Qxx of @cs and 2 spades, then not ducking would have produced effects EW don't want to think about.|pg||
nt|baldjean: I don't believe this. did declarer miscount?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||

mb|3C|nt|gracelin: North can bid 4H right away or show his club to involve south in hiogh level decision.|pg||

nt|andyv:  S basically was one and done|pg||
nt|gsper:  Patrick, a few days ago there was a discussion about when the Precision 2@D was...|pg||
nt|gsper:  extended to distributions like 3415. Do you know?|pg||
nt|gracelin: north probably has seen partner open light, or he might double 2H to compete in any of the other 3 suits.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I know the method but not the discussion|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gracelin: he was our captain many times, once in Bermuda Bowl and twice in Team lympiad.|pg||

nt|gracelin: Hi Jeanine|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are either up very early or staying up very late |pg||
nt|baldjean: born and grew up in the USA though|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no entries and such a weak suit, W would have been better off to lead partner's known 5 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  so only a 2 imp loss although we don't know how the play went here|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|baldjean: +1 only? so declarer too kno chances in @h, despite East's bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|baldjean: took no chances*|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|1N|nt|baldjean: the latter|pg||
nt|gracelin: from each 8-team group, only the top two will aualify for the finals.  |pg||
nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
mb|d|nt|twcho: EW is probably playing precision too|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: a boring 3NT, probably.|pg||
nt|gracelin: qualify|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S was doubled in other room and made 3 overtricks on D lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: thie is one of the quarter final matches. 32 boards in 2 segments.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I think we have to guess at some of these, Jean|pg||
nt|gracelin: This HK team is the same that represent HK in the PABF in KL.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|twcho: which strategy will you choose with North hand, bid @c or bid @h only, Patrick?|pg||
nt|gracelin: the slam in closed room is doomed.  6C has better chance but will also fail when the spade K is wrong.|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  I don't think EW will be that ambitious here|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: CR north responds 1@s to partner's opening 1@d, quite an interesting choice|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess so.  Wang in West is the sponsor of the Fanhua (Pan China) team.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this will be an easy make as the lead will give E three tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 3H bid gives declarer lot of information in the play.|pg||
nt|gracelin: ths is the last match of the RR from group B.  Both teams are unlikely to qualify for the finals starting tomorrow.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now the penalty will get almost as much as the Vul. slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 4H would be a lucky make but I can agree East's pass|pg||
nt|twcho: and here south chose to rebid 2@d rather than showing his pointless @s suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: China's national team is in group D, Hongkong's national team is in group C.  They lost to Ji Li last match.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: but with bad breaks in H and C, don't see how declarer can come to 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: the 32 teams in the 4 groups will play RR within the group.  Top two teams from each group will quaify for the 8 team fina in the two last days.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N must have paid his insurance policy to be able to bid 4@s|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gracelin: defender is trying to set up cross-ruff opportunity.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Tommy Cho|pg||
nt|twcho: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and hello to you, Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Tommy and Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and all specs|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: North likes 2D more .|pg||
nt|twcho: and 2@dX is not too risky too|pg||
nt|gracelin: trump lead may hold declarer to 3D and 2 Aces for -3|pg||
nt|twcho: even making will lose 180|pg||
nt|gracelin: and north knows it's won't|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gracelin: defenders can win another 2H, 1S and 1C, so the contract will probably be made.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he will learn to be more cautious next time after he saw partner's 3S here.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: on the other hand, declarer can eatablish 2S, 3C and 2D for 7 tricks.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Well - it worked. Especially if he had got a @S lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5H is ok even on spade lead.  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  nice inference taken by declarer in @c suit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gsper:  Right.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but East may also take the finesse incase south has two Duaminds only and two trumps.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gracelin: Group A is the VIP group including sponsors and other VIP's.   |pg||
nt|twcho: This is an invitational event held in Shenzhen|pg||
nt|gracelin: South is better not to cover, but he doesn't know declarer has 5H|pg||
nt|twcho: 32 teams competing|pg||
nt|twcho: divided into 4 groups|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: welcome back|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|twcho: top 2 teams of each group enter into the KO stage|pg||
nt|twcho: impossible to go down|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gracelin: Sun and Kang's misfortune on board 4 (800 in 4S X) gave away 12 imps.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: Patrick said earlier the main sponsor is playing at the other table |pg||
nt|gracelin: In this way the VIP's are assred of two berths in the final. |pg||
nt|gracelin: I came late but the Open Team has a useful lead.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: N very glad to X that contract :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: guess it's -1|pg||
nt|gracelin: the H finesse is risky and unnecessary, can go down if south has singleton D and 2 little H.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gracelin: if declarer overtake S10 and draw south's trump|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: Mr. Chen |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: yes, Mr. SH Chen, a fine player himself.|pg||
nt|baldjean: tomorrow, or rather today meanwhile, is a holiday in Germany (reunification day), so I can sta up late|pg||
nt|gracelin: defender's 4th H trick is blocked, but declarer has only 7 tricks.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|baldjean: stay*|pg||

nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|twcho: we will see score correction soon|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's takeout to 5H is also questionable.  Partner's double of 4S indicated he held balanced hand rather than long minor.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Li will not be happy.|pg||
nt|twcho: not sure what is the min. no. of @d east guarantees by his 1@d opening|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: guess it's 3.|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: EW didn't enter the bidding last board after south opened 1NT.  So EW actuat\lly won 7 imps by missing the 4H game.|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@d is probably multi|pg||
nt|gsper:  That is the drawback of having shown nothing about your distribution before the 5 level.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: I meant at other table.|pg||
nt|twcho: showing either M|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin:  thought last hand a routine 3NT, but Shanxi reached 5C there to give the host team 10 imps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Fanhua has a chance to get a revenge here.|pg||
nt|twcho: Here, 1@d promise 3+|pg||

mb|1H|nt|andyv:  N didn't quite get the auction he was hoping for|pg||
nt|twcho: they can find 43 fit now|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting for south to bid 1@h instead of 1@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS have 7-card in both majors, and breaking 3-3 n both.|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: EW can make 3D|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will surely bid game with his maximum.  just a choice of game and I guess N will pick 4S|pg||
nt|twcho: 3NT has no chance|pg||
nt|twcho: with no entry and a void, North will probably retreat to 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: north can see that he has no entry for the long spade unless south has SA.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 7H by dropping south H10, but 6H is a sound contract anyway.|pg||
nt|twcho: EW are young players based in Shenzhen while NS are veteran partners based in Beijing|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand totally useless to S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 3N will be making for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 3NT so even -2 or -3 is not disaster.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|baldjean: probably 1 OT because of @h lead|pg||
nt|twcho: 1NT is 13-15 I suppose|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: 3C will play less well.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Shanxi Qinlian is from the province Shanxi.  The world ladies champion HL Wang used to play in this team.  Wang is from SHanxi. |pg||
nt|twcho: a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|twcho: east holding @sJ so there is no risk of going down here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Club ruff will beat this.  Very nice lead |pg||
nt|gsper:  It seems that NS do not play Precision.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't blame south for jumping to game.  He is entitled to play partner for at least one useful card.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in CR, N did not bid immediately and came in with 2@d bid over S's dbl of 1NT |pg||
nt|gracelin: South was to bid after XX but tried 1H first to see if  it can escape a double.  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|gracelin: to bid 1S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|baldjean: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: might make 4 on D lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: I agree with that.|pg||

nt|twcho: which is very popular system in China|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT seems to be some sort of a D raise.|pg||

nt|gracelin: The China National team is going to Netherland for Bermuda Bowl in mid Oct.  This is their last tournament before the world championships.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|gracelin: EW is cold for 4H but NS can sacrifice in 4S for -2 and a small profit.|pg||

mb|p|nt|twcho: 2@c = both M or S+C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: maybe north should find a bid over 1C at non-Vul.|pg||
nt|twcho: but his venture will not be successful|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gracelin: possible, but he is facing a strong 1C opening so game is not in his planning.|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|twcho: what is the difference between pass then bid 3@s and direct 3@s by west over the 2NT bid?|pg||
nt|gracelin: also south didn't have a suit to cue.  Many play NT bid as cue over a strong club opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's original pass shows a very weak hand so west delayed the 3S bid as a balancing one in orde not to encoursge East to raise.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he knew 2NT was a D fit, so he would have chance to bid 3S next round.|pg||
nt|twcho: what do you think about north rebid of 3@d? seems that he has quite a good hand|pg||
nt|twcho: Can he rebid 3@c instead of 3@d?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Not sure, since I don't know the exact meaning of the 2NT.  If it's a cue, then north may consider 3C.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|gracelin: 3NT is reasonable but I will cue 4S with the south hand, and raise whatever minor suit north bids to slam.|pg||

mb|d|nt|gracelin: will see another Precision action.  Don't thk they could stop in 3C afer the intervention.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: there are 4 natural losers and maybe another from a club overruff.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgs: wow... |pg||
nt|gracelin: mabe 4C, still ok|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi Ji Chang Da gained 7 imps by competing to 4D in cloosed room on the hand West made 3S here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|gracelin: West may shiftnow, which makes the hand an open bok.|pg||
nt|twcho: EW is probably also playing precision|pg||
nt|gracelin: I would have overcalled 1S with the north hand though his tactic works.|pg||
nt|twcho: isn't that double of 2@h should promise black suits|pg||
mb|3S|nt|twcho: don't know what he will do if partner bids 3@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, north is probably prepared to correct 3C to 3D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is tough one |pg||
nt|twcho: The ladies are more aggressive. CR NS are ladies|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1NT is making.  Defenders can only take 3S, 2H and either a D or club.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't understand why East didn't simply raise 2S (too good?) but choose double to get his side to 3-level.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|twcho: 2@s likely make for EW|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: even thinking gives declarer useful info.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: guess this must be 12 imps to Shou Chuang.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: declarer need to use SA as entry to finesse DK immediaely to dispose the H loserm and establish a liong one for spade discard.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the question or point made by specs is that the dbl may show @cs or some other card combination.  I agree and still think the E hand is worth a 2@s bid unless E is just trying to bail out|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  anyway NS won't have to worry about playing 3@h here|pg||
nt|gracelin: I would always take the low road when partner is a 3rd hand opening.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|twcho: 4 aces to lose|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's never a good idea to be pushed to game after a balancing action.|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|twcho: 3 imps to EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: though I have sympathy with north.  All he needs is Axxxx of trumps.  Maybe he could raise 2S to 3S earlier.|pg||
nt|twcho: but 4@s probably not a high expectation. only require to find partner with Axxxx in @s and it will be a nice contract|pg||

nt|sybarra: yes then can pitch the ht |pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: better to overtake when @c10 appears|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: 5C is there, but does N knows south is so distributional|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4H depends on the D guess.  |pg||
mb|4D!|nt|gracelin: if south bids again, north will raise to game|pg||
nt|twcho: it has become rare to play 16-18 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, but they also open sound.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gracelin: D lead will help solve the issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: the alert seems to indicate the opening is a multi, i.e. S + minor.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks polish|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: for teams not able to qualify for the KO, they will play Swiss Teams and the round robin result will be carry to the next stage for them|pg||
nt|gsper:  Multi? That kind of bid has a lot of names around the world.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they do allow 5-4 for the opening, then maybe south should just pass 2S.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|twcho: 40% actually will be carried forward to the Swiss|pg||
nt|gracelin: if declarer play SA to be on side, then he can discard dummy's 3rd D on good clubs.|pg||
nt|twcho: still he has to guess to finesse in @d or @s|pg||
nt|twcho: suppose S will return a @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: with all lower honors in defender hands and no spade lead, it's likely that north is holding SA, though not certain.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: EW play advancer's change of suit forcing (1S here), thus the 2D continuation.|pg||
nt|twcho: I wonder whether 2@d should promise more than a bare minimum overcall|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: no, a non-reverse new suit just shows hand pattern and not promising more.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, tks|pg||
nt|twcho: EW has reached the normal 3NT|pg||
nt|twcho: only 6 top tricks in sight|pg||
nt|gracelin: I meant East|pg||
nt|andyv:  polish 2@s= 5@s and 4+ of other, not @hs|pg||
nt|gsper:  Muiderberg in Holland.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, this is a good hints|pg||
nt|gracelin: here south is sure to return a Diamond, but he doesn't want to play it too fast. |pg||
nt|twcho: does the tempo of playing back a @d creates UI|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|gracelin: snce he is likely to have a natural trump trick, hw could also be genuinely consider foa a club shift.  All break-in-tempo maybe subject to UI.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gracelin: 3NT is the best contract here.  |pg||
nt|andyv:  Unknown in the US:)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is hoping for 1S + 3D + 3C, but will be disapponted when club breaks 4-1|pg||
nt|twcho: Running score can be found at http://ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=1323|pg||
nt|gracelin: now defenders are ahead for 2S, 2H, 2D and 1C|pg||
nt|gracelin: but on first trick, it's allowed more time to think over the whole hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: the failing to return a D may make declarer believe south has DQ.|pg||
nt|twcho: but the leader to the next trick should not be so tempo sensitive as he is considering which suit to attack. This does not apply to the 2nd hand or 3rd hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Lucas or Tartan 2 in UK|pg||

nt|andyv:  on board 9, the excellent @s slam was not reached in the CR|pg||
nt|andyv:  here 4@s seems pretty routine|pg||
nt|baldjean: unless E/W have ambitions. after W sgows @s fit E may get ideas|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after taking DA declarer should cash his winner before exit with HJ.  He still make if D is 6-2, but go down only 1 if D are 5-3|pg||
nt|twcho: so instead of one down, now he is 3 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: the result shows that declarer makes his contract|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gracelin: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Patrick|pg||
nt|baldjean: shows*|pg||
nt|twcho: 1NT is perhaps the most complicated contract with both sides of about equal strength|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a routine 3NT for NS.  H lead will be threatening but declarer will prevail.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so he must guess correctly at the end|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|gracelin: our first slam|pg||
mb|d!|nt|gracelin: once West shows long spade, East cannot be stopped in game.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4NT and one key-card will do the work.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, that's the best line catering for making chance and only going one down at most|pg||
nt|gracelin: East has a lot of defense for his 4C bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I need to go and thanks all.  See you guys tomorrow at the finals.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but it is just impossible for the defense to gather enough setting tricks as the cards lie|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|twcho: with @c 33 and defenders @h 44, nothing can hurt declarer|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gracelin: 3D prbably show a maximum weak 2S|pg||
nt|twcho: north opening is somewhat not complying iwth their CC|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: there will be four 16 boards matches today and 3 tomorrow to complete the 8 team RR in every group.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E has a monster hand opposite the multi|pg||
nt|gracelin: while 3S shows a minimum 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6S is also a practical bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but 4@s probably make|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S maybe making with the help of the 4C bid so 5C is a cheap save.|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, just threatening.|pg||
nt|twcho: CC states 5+ or 4414|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: Guess north will not follow S10 if he doesn't have H10 together with the K.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|twcho: 2@c is artificial|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|twcho: does not promise @c|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: 3 round of D wll hold the contract to 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  reverse W's minor suit holdings and 6 would be in the picture|pg||
nt|baldjean: see?|pg||
nt|gracelin: South need to lead D originally to save the SK entry for a D ruff.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  does this have any play?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gracelin: yes, but still need the trump Q to drop.|pg||
nt|gracelin: SQ ruff, of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  it will if you aren't in 6 and won't if you are|pg||
nt|andyv:  S could have made it easier on partner by playing the 8 of @d|pg||
nt|twcho: good manouvre by north to unblock the 9|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: 4 board to go for this round and the next match will start in exactly 2 hours from now.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  E may take the hook now|pg||
nt|twcho: the @h shift has denied declarer chance to try @d|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: now even if clubs were not 3-3, West can be endplayed if he is the one long in club.|pg||
nt|twcho: EW is now playing in NS best fit suit|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgs: Thank You everybody for joining us today in the final Match of this Tournament....  |pg||

nt|Vugraphzgs: Goodbye All... Cikiciew! : : |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: :):):):)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @hs were 3-3 with K on side, this would be a cold slam|pg||
nt|twcho: in case south has AKJ7 instead of AKJ6, they will be able to enjoy 4 @h tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: but now defender still has an entry in H for the D ruff.  Declare need to duck HA.|pg||
nt|twcho: south correctly deduced that north is unlikely to hold @h10|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gracelin: When north now lead back a small H, south should know north still has H10, or declarer will not play HQ earlier.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|baldjean: not with K10xx @h in S|pg||
nt|andyv:  right....they had to be 3-3|pg||
nt|twcho: the other room NS has scored 10 tricks in @s contract|pg||

nt|gracelin: stiff|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, a 9-card suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|andyv:  board 10 was 13 imps to EW when 4@h made 5 in CR|pg||
mb|4D|nt|gracelin: 3NT by north is probably where this hand will rest.|pg||
nt|gracelin: some modernest may only overcall 2C with the south hand.  Then north must find a bid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S dbles now |pg||
nt|sybarra: or bid 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|gracelin: There is a line between t/o double and simple overcall.  South hand is a little too strong for me to only overcall.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW only has partial in spades here, but easy to reach a spade game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I wonder what S expects to do with the double?  Spend the rest of the auction trying to convince N he really has none of the other suits?|pg||
nt|twcho: Patrick, will you opt for double if east hand is with one @c less and one @d more?|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS can make 4@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: south is from Eric Kokish's school and north is from the same school.|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have bid 5@d over 2@c|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  right, but he had to assume that the Q of @s was with S since N didn't ruff with the Q|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  that seems sensible|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: Double, I might even double with this actual hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south's double scared EW to bid their spades. |pg||
nt|gsper:  b|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet we missed a pass |pg||
nt|twcho: not everyone act with south hand|pg||
nt|twcho: with all the quacks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  it was a guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and foolish N thinks partner has suits for the double|pg||
pc|d2|nt|twcho: the 4@d has shut out the game contract for NS|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: but declarer has no intermedate sot for any finesse|pg||
nt|gracelin: spot|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@c seems makeable|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|baldjean: the @d become worthless in @ss|pg||
nt|gracelin: the cards are not lying well for declarer so the 22 pts 1NT is not a sure thing yet.|pg||
nt|twcho: leading from Q10xx normally a better choice than from AJ9x, especially against 1NT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  that is rather amusing|pg||
nt|andyv:  S still thinking|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: for 1NT, the quacks are just as fines.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  true...I was only curious as to what E was thinking when N didn't ruff with the Q|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gracelin: south found the most damaging lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this time Qx does not work as a stopper|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gracelin: But did south's long huddle before bdding 2C give north some hint?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@H vul would not have occurred to me, but it worked.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  yes, E can't play @hs on his own|pg||
nt|gracelin: north not ruffing with Q1098 ?|pg||
nt|twcho: better to strip the @c by using trump as entry|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gracelin: better cash SA now or will lose it.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shanxi won a swing last board.  The other room also in 4C but went down.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, declarer has 6 tricks now.  both sides are fighting for the 7th tricks.|pg||
nt|gracelin: spade is declarer 7th trick|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|baldjean: why double when trump suit is clear?|pg||
nt|gracelin: south maybe subject to an endplay if declarer reads the cards well.|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that south will be endplayed if declarer read the position accurately|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: so how gutsy is N  re the club? |pg||
pc|h8|nt|gracelin: an easy -1|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|gracelin: north made a cunning play of SQ, otherwise, declarer may well duck the S9.|pg||

nt|gracelin: declarer can also establish a spade trick now.|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: East did not hear me and lose his SA.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: right|pg||
nt|twcho: in bd 10, the auction is exactly the same until east double the 3NT and north scared and run to 4@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: this should be an easy 4S for EW, both in bidding and play.|pg||
nt|twcho: and lose 10 more imps|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: NS's 4H depend on the location of DA, but EW can make 4S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't see why he did that.  He should not be ashamed of his double of 3H with AK, A and a 5-card suit. |pg||
mb|r!|nt|sybarra: cash it you dont get it   maybe try caps next time |pg||
nt|twcho: certainly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the precsion 2 @C |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sybarra: will S bid spades |pg||
nt|twcho: and 4@c is not guaranteed to be a good contract either|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3H is a cue of opponent's implied H suit.  It shows invitationa or better hand for spade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: they are behind the time schedule|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N a decent contract|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|gracelin: yes, 4C will be too high, but may also push NS into the unmaking 4S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will surely pass 3 if East didn't compete, but now he is tempted.|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone has to hear the screeching of brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks as if EW will be shut out of bidding|pg||
nt|twcho: don't know whether time penalty will be enforced|pg||
nt|twcho: redouble force opener to bid 2@c it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|gracelin: I'd love to make most of my 3NT contract better. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: both 3N or 4@s makeable for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|gracelin: yes, if NS can make 4S, north would have bid it over 3C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  perhaps E could have doubled 2NT|pg||
nt|twcho: good stop. even 5@s is dangerous|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: -2 is ok since NS is likely to make 3S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's Cue is just in case West has a strong raise hand, which West didn't have.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, when west sign off, east doesn't have many in reserve|pg||
nt|twcho: and wisely pass|pg||
nt|gsper:  A little obscene if you ask me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 2NT looks to be jacoby and south's jump to 4H show a very bad opening|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the last of four matches played today.  Tomorrow has 3 more matches for the RR.  The top 2 teams in each group will qualify for the finals. |pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: 1 loser in each suit|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andyv:  they may play it in 4@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: or a good fit in minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  since W will know the take out is on distribution, he may take the plunge with 4@s or 5@cs|pg||
nt|famus: ew will venture in 3NT--perhaps|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, might see it happen.  But not sure whether CCBL allows.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: interesting that N opened in the other room on that board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: My guess is they will reach 6S and struggle for -1 in very slow play.|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would have liked to know the meaning of 3@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s will also make...3N a bit easier|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|twcho: I think China is quite flexible. :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|twcho: quite an unexpected bid by North|pg||
nt|twcho: looks like another bidding misunderstanding|pg||
nt|twcho: as I am told, west is the sponsor so the partnership may not be so solid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: can they stop below 6?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looked like 2@s was going down at least 3 which isn't quite good enough because of the vul|pg||
pc|dK|nt|famus: wow-|pg||
nt|baldjean: was 2@d some kind of weak Flannery?|pg||
nt|twcho: with his great @c suit and mediocre support for @H|pg||
nt|gracelin: north is playing south for stronger H and weaker S, probably not warranted.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: don't thk so.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: this is not making.  South may lead C10 to ask for a spade return|pg||
nt|gracelin: or lead SK himself to ensure 4 tricks for defenders.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south has, say : Ax  AJ10xx  Axxx  xx, 4H maybe the winning contract.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  on 13 in CR?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is lucky for them that the @h breaks as friendly as possible|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: guess not |pg||
nt|baldjean: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi|pg||
nt|famus: -2 wud b a god score for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: DA and club now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: 5S maybe a general slam try and south does like his hand.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  but, in lieu of doubling, N should have been showing his hand...6@d a pretty easy contract|pg||
nt|twcho: any established partnership should have discussed the meaning of double - a very important subject for everyone|pg||
pc|d8|nt|famus: shud duck @h continuation|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should have been using the entries to dummy to ruff @ds|pg||
nt|famus: yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: the deenders are sharp, not giving declarer any chance.|pg||
nt|twcho: Finessing @s seems a better play than playing @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't like the early D play.  takwe spade finesse is more normal line.|pg||
nt|twcho: I think he will go down now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  this getting close to being suicidal|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|twcho: NS has played solidly throughout this match|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: agree, either fast or slowly|pg||
pc|sK|nt|baldjean: not much use though. ruffing @d will give W more trump tricks|pg||
nt|famus: with -2 the match might even out|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|gracelin: That explains the scores.|pg||
mc|8|nt|twcho: so a doubtful bid by N and equally doubtful play by S has done them|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as EW don't have the levels in. What if 2@D was 10+ force or ( for shure can't pass a neg re X=?|pg||

nt|andyv:  or, after the 2@s bid, again, 3@d might have gotten NS to 6|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, he takes a unilateral action.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|twcho: everytime EW ends up in a marginal game, they were duly punished|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: by the accurate defense|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: The 5th match will start 14 hours from now. |pg||
mb|3C|nt|gracelin: yes, I thk north is very conservative in choosing 3NT.  Double and a trump lead may beat 2S 1,100.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C could be either CAPP (one suiter) or suction (D, or both M's).|pg||
nt|twcho: tks Patrick for your great commentating. It is always enlightening|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Thank you, Tommy.  Nice to be with you, too.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: So the 6S was slowly -1 as expected.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: West will bid his major.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and south may compete in club, knowing partner is long there.|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board of this set|pg||
nt|twcho: this is the last bd of this segment|pg||
nt|twcho: next one will resume in 50 min time|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Whome to steel what here? @DEW or @C - 3NT NS?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: NS might in fact make 5C, especially by south to avoid a H opening lead.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  want to thank everyone for participating |pg||
mc|9|nt|famus: with @d9 with declarer--routine 4@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  last hand of this set|pg||
nt|twcho: this will be doubled|pg||
nt|twcho: much better judgment by Li than his counterpart in CR|pg||
nt|twcho: so a hugh lead for the National team|pg||
