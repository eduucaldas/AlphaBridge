mb|2N!|nt|joest: 2NT often used as a four card limit raise (or better) and that looks to be true here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|joest: trump leads is best but that's far from clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW seem to play pretty standard Polish Club; 1@c=11-14 bal, 15-18 nat or 19+ any|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c nat, 2@d=wk 2M, 2M two-suited|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2N both minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: watch out for Polsih carding: lead low from a doubleton. Virtually compulsory in Poland, like having to have four trumps to raise in France |pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|joest: and if you have low standards for overcalls west could have popped in with 1@s and headed this all off at the pass :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|joest: 3NT might seem like a big bid but: (a) he is vulnerable (b) he has a good five card suit; (c) these hands play great when the NT bidder sits over pretty much all the known high ...|pg||
nt|joest: cards|pg||
nt|joest: of course this stretches those principles to the limit :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: best defence is for @HA and a diamond switch (ducked by East), but that may not be too easy to find|pg||
nt|joest: an opening diamond lead would have forced declarer to be pretty much double dummy|pg||
nt|joest: but East put his faith in his partner, which is generally a good thing|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: North should conceal the @h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or East could take @dQ and lead small back  |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|joest: that is that|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|joest: with a diamond switch, I think it was always going to come down to north guessing the spade queen: diffcult|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still scope for defensive error|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West needs to go up with the @HA|pg||
nt|joest: east could returnsomething else and pitch an encouraging diamond the last club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, that would do|pg||
nt|joest: of course declarer is squeezing himself on the clubs so he may well play hearts himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite fraught defending these types of contract - you know if you go wrong it's a likely game swing out |pg||
nt|penseur9: on a @C finesse I beleive can make 3nt (I'm a born optimist) :)|pg||
nt|joest: the heart position might have been a bit clearer if west had ducked the opening lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read the CC right, @s7 shows no spade interest|pg||
nt|joest: but the highspade spot would seem to suggest the layout is at it seems|pg||
