nt|sybarra: we will sort this out |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Jean and Andy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|andyv:  Hi Roland, Jean and everyone|pg||
nt|baldjean: hello all|pg||
nt|andyv:  and hi Li, our operator|pg||
nt|andyv:  a healthy 3@d call by N will put S to the test|pg||
nt|baldjean: 5@d makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know how to pronounce the player names, but at least I can spell them :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d can be made|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North is Fu Zhong I am told|pg||
nt|baldjean: @h split well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a world class player who used to play with Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|andyv:  and @d suit behaves|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 tricks, S should just bid 5@ds|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @c suit should be the pusher|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hope we are not stuck|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  precicion 2@c and 2@s not forcing|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|gracelin: This is second half of the quarter.  Of the 4 quarter final matches, this has the widest margin.  |pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: of QF match only has 1 imp difference, the other 3 imps.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: both pairs here play Precision.  2D is GF staymen, 3C showed 5-card clubs.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the 2nd half of one of the semi final matches.  The other match is alomost decided.  Shenzhen led Shanghai by 58 imps in 1st half.|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|gracelin: NS use Rusinow lead, lower of touching honors.|pg||
nt|gracelin: the prizes for the top 4 finishers are S$19,000 for winner, 12,500 for 2nd place, 9,000 for 3rd and 6,000 for 4th.|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: EW for the National Team is the only pair that play a natural system in the team.  Other 2 pairs are Precisioners.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and they bid effectively to the excellent grand slam with their own "Lian's natural system"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|gracelin: south would need to shift to H to save the overtrick|pg||

nt|andyv:  re everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|twcho: west is a bit aggressive to bid to a thin game at bd 1 and went down inevitably |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|gracelin: it's always not easy to bid very strong 4441 hand.  Lian and Shi overcame that huddle.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  borderline invitational but the K@d is a big asset|pg||
mb|4S|nt|twcho: NS is playing precision judging from bd 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can make 3NT but tough to bid after opponents' strong 1C opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south might bid 3NT here, if he is brave.|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @c suit behaving, 12 tricks in NT are there for the taking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|twcho: Precision is probably the prevailing system in China|pg||
nt|gracelin: north didn't preempt 3D but bid 2D then 3D.  In addition to seven good D, I will expect 1-2 useful card outside, which will make 3NT good.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5N looks like pick a slam bid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: 3 @C was precarious  for sure |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @S not easy either |pg||
nt|sybarra: leading a @D might have worked better but may be time if ht played too early |pg||
nt|sybarra: as stated,  maybe @D works better for the ruff,  but no way to tell that given the bidding |pg||
nt|sybarra: we may be stuck again|pg||
nt|sybarra: operator more problems?|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for EW, the wrong party is on lead...N has an easy @h lead and should be able to signal for a @c switch|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|andyv:  down 2|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  or more|pg||
nt|gracelin: and NS couldn't even beat 3S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gracelin: both tables found the good sacrifice.  NS can make 7C but hard to be confident on the Grand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if he plays to make contract, it will be down 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  not vul, the penalty is not as severe if W tries to make this |pg||
nt|andyv:  something went a miss....rarely do you want to play a slam in your 4-3 fit.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|twcho: the @c position is the most favorable possible for declarer|pg||
nt|twcho: but declarer doesn't know about it|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  fortunately for NS, 12 tricks are still there|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|twcho: and he guesses the trump|pg||
nt|gracelin: north already knows they have a cold 3NT.|pg||
nt|gracelin: meantime the Swiss teams are going on.  Winner there will also get a US$8,000 prize.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Gi Li Motor is now leading the Swiss field.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  so now, 9 tricks for the defense unless S feels obligated to part with a @c on the run of @hs|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW has an easy 4H but NS can sacrifice 5C for a small profit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: north may just bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice prize money |pg||
nt|baldjean: operator is apparently trying to catch up|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 2N bid turned out to be costly|pg||

nt|gracelin: This is the 5th match of the round robin.  The 32 teams field are divided into 4 groups.  The top teams from each group will qualify for the finals.|pg||
nt|twcho: a possible grand|pg||
nt|twcho: and a very good small slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably one major|pg||
nt|andyv:  over a dbl, 1@d may show better values (5-7 or so)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  catching up on boards...on 2, EW took their obvious 4 tricks and then E probably ruffed a @c with his stiff K@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: north chose to defend but I can'd see where four tricks are coming from.|pg||
nt|gracelin: No, he hasn't given up yet.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|gracelin: top 2 teams|pg||
nt|gracelin: if 5C now, why nor earlier.  In fact I might bid 3NT over 3C and run if get doubled.|pg||
mb|d|nt|twcho: let's see where they'll finish|pg||
nt|twcho: minor slam is more difficult to bid because of the space constraints|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: East 3NT is everybody's bid but he bought a poor dummy here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5H is still an easy make.  In fact even 6H can make on good spade guess.|pg||
nt|gracelin: West is considering 5D, but guess he will pass.|pg||
nt|gracelin: because partner can pass 5C as forcing if he wanted to encourage west to compete.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: South has a minimum but very good supporting hand for his partner|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China national team has won the grand slam swing.  Other able stopped in 6C only|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: 3 @H usually a good spade raise |pg||
nt|gracelin: The whole field of 32 teams are divided into 4 groups.  This match is from group A, what is called the VIP group.|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting on board 2, EW got very active and bid to 4@s making|pg||
nt|andyv:  a decent slam missed in either minor and NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's bids are not making the W hand any better|pg||
nt|gracelin: table|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: and W will convert|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Göran Sperber|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  this should make with 5@s, 1@h and 3@c|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is fast arrival, showing a very weak opening but good D stoppers.|pg||
nt|gracelin: CA and D|pg||
nt|gracelin: defender will take their 5 top tricks for -3.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|gracelin: yes, 3H is a genuine invitation while a raise to 3S is defined as a Courtesy raise.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|gracelin: The total prize money for this invitational event is around US$68,000.  Winner alone will get about US$20,000|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|gsper:  Is everybody playing Precision here?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: just a bit unlucky here |pg||
nt|gracelin: I like south's 3C opening.  Everything goes at this Vul.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|twcho: north didn't manage to find out the information he wants but he gamble that there will be good chance to produce the 13 tricks he needs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gracelin: This tournament is sponsored solely by Nan Gang Done Li , a power company in Guandong.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Goran and Roland|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS made 4H in closed room which is a great result for Shi Ji CHang Da.|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW are ...don't know about NS yet|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|gsper:  Ty.|pg||

nt|gracelin: south found a good lead, if he led his partner's suit, H, 4S might make.|pg||
nt|baldjean: with 5/5 in majors I can understand they became active. East's hand is upgraded a lot if there isd a fit and even more so if there is a double fit|pg||
nt|gracelin: now|pg||
nt|twcho: National Team has quite a handsome lead into this last segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|gsper:  This board does not promise much drama either.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ni hao: welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: the trailing team need some big swings to overturn the deficit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: this looks like precision auction |pg||
nt|twcho: east can bid 3@h (must be forcing) or 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Yes, Shirley, they are competing with Mr. Yeh.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and poor E has virtually nothing |pg||
nt|gracelin: You will see lot of Precision actions in this tournament, I guess more than 60% of Chinese players play Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I recall from other vugraphs  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I must say I play with many chinese players on bbo,  and they play an excellent 2/1 game also!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (since I do not play precision) |pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, you need to know natural system well to also play well with Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hates to balance and find the next bid to be 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: but he knows pard has some point given the E bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: *points|pg||
nt|gracelin: this East hand worth a 2S raise in the way I play, but no harm is done.|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you mostly play precision, Patrick?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  N believes Qx of @s is a stopper|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S is touch and go.  A club opening lead will beat it.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Patrick:)|pg||
nt|twcho: good morning everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Ths is the 2nd match of the RR from group C.  Both teams have won their first match.|pg||
nt|gsper:  N had no quite satisfactory bid.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 1NT overcall does lead to an easy 3NT bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  o tricks with the @s and just playing for overtricks...these are the times partners get upset if you go down:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|twcho: This is the 1st segment of the quarter final|pg||
nt|twcho: losing team will go into the Swiss Teams event while the winner will advance to the semi|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Tommy, NS has a close 4H.  South may need to lead a club for a spade shift to bea it.|pg||
nt|twcho: both pairs in this table play precision which is very popular in China|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: East may bid 3NT now and make on a spade lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: or East 3H, West 3S, East 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  dbl limited S hand to 5-7 probably|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gracelin: Jiang in south here play for China Open team last year at the PABF in New Zealand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: nice lead, now another club lead from East when he gets in will beat 4S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's vital that defenders have both C9 and C8 in their hands.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: Mr. Gua, sitting north here, is the boss of the automibile company.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW, Sun and Kang are member of China open team many years ago.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sun made his name known in the semi-final match against Italy in the 2004 Olympiad.  Sun and Kang also reached semi-final in the 2011 Vanderbilt in the Spring NABC.|pg||
nt|baldjean: 6nt actually make here, but they won't be bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  that doesn't look right|pg||
nt|gracelin: He and Zhang play natural, including 16-18 1NT.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C seems to be part of the 2-way check back.  2C for invitational hand and 2D for GF.|pg||
nt|twcho: with @h breaking, declarer can enter dummy with the 3rd @H|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: north has no reason to go on.|pg||
nt|twcho: guess 4@h shows a min|pg||
nt|gracelin: as I said, need a club lead to beat this.|pg||
nt|twcho: with no slam interest|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|twcho: Winner of main event will get 120,000 RMB prize money. The winner of the Swiss Teams also gets 50,000 RMB|pg||
nt|twcho: Liu finds the fatal lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: south duly finds it.  North is sure to shift to spade after winning CK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after south takes 2 spade tricks, need a D shift to take away the entry for long clubs.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, need accurate defense to beat this contract|pg||
pc|s3|nt|twcho: NS are current China national team members and they will soon go to Eindhoven of Netherlands to compete in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|twcho: their CC can be found here: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/China/li-liu.pdf|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gracelin: remember, his 1NT rebid could be as many as 15 CP|pg||
nt|gracelin: HCP|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead will create a lot of problems|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is one of the semi final matches.  The other is Shanghai playing another team from Shenzhen.|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 3, E probably did not take the best line of play and went down 2 in 3N...13 imps to the National Team|pg||
nt|gracelin: I see.  The national team must a favorite to win this match.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  probably best to duck here|pg||
nt|twcho: and make certain of his contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  lack of entries to dummy wll make this a difficult hand to play esp. after a @s lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  free finesse time|pg||
nt|gracelin: and an entry for D finesse.|pg||
nt|andyv:  now N has 2 entries to dummy to hook the @ds|pg||
nt|gracelin: the other table is in 3H doubled for at least 500.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer should have taken the first trick with CA to confuse opponents.  Now it's clear he has CA.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|gracelin: the lead is helpful.  declarer may only lose 2S + 2D for his contract.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he needs to handle well and guess everything.|pg||
nt|gracelin: running the D7 will be a good start.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N can now float the 8 of @ds|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|twcho: this is probably not the best line|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  nice play pitching K@c|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|gracelin: low spade also works well|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes indeed.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  taking A@s and E must find the Q of @c|pg||
nt|twcho: but South has dicarded too many @s |pg||
nt|twcho: how can a trump return be correct?|pg||
nt|twcho: given the threatening @c suit in dummy|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, I don't understand it either.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: How could East raise his passed hand partner to game is a little surprising.  He also has wasted honors in club.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: Sun obviously has length in Heart so East seems to have an unsuitable hand for partner.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this case, not a problem|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|twcho: so probably not enough winner to set declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: East is not sure who has C8, but if he has a count in D, cub return is his only chance now.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  but if S had Qxx of @cs and 2 spades, then not ducking would have produced effects EW don't want to think about.|pg||
nt|baldjean: I don't believe this. did declarer miscount?|pg||
nt|gracelin: now Club to A amd C10 pitches a spade is the safest way|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|gracelin: West did not shift to club gives an indication that he holds CQ.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gracelin: Heart shift will be 800|pg||
nt|twcho: and it seems to me that north hasn't given a hard thought on it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: maybe West should double 2S to show an honor there.  |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|gracelin: he did think for a while, though.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|twcho: yes, the declarer takes the safest route|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|gracelin: now 3NT for EW.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: rehi.  Yes, shirley. I do lay Precision with my current partner.|pg||
nt|gsper:  3NT was a funny contract on these hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: This is the 4th match (today's last) of the RR from group C.  Only two teams from each group will qualify for the finals|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW will outbid NS in spades here.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: North can bid 4H right away or show his club to involve south in hiogh level decision.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on a H lead, dummy H10 wins, a D was taken by north DK, but he led back a H instead of spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Shanghai Pudong is 5th in the C group and HK 8th.  Both teams need good win in this and remaining matches to have any chance.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|twcho: 1N=8-13 or 16+ bal; can be 4441|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, so both table slip in defense|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is making by EW, will West bid it ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Though 4@H won't be much fun with 4-1 trumps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: really East should overcall 2D last round.|pg||
nt|twcho: west does have a great fitting hand|pg||
nt|twcho: he knows @d must be running|pg||
nt|twcho: and partner likely to hold 6 cards at least|pg||
nt|twcho: but still only 7 tricks in view|pg||

mb|3N|nt|sybarra: I understand you played it as it was being developed |pg||

nt|gracelin: great recovery.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, that was Mr. CC Wei's time, more than 40 years ago.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's 1@h call may help S in playing this hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: at where the should be :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Even 2@H could be down with a little misguessing.|pg||
nt|twcho: although @s doesn't break, declarer should still likely be able to gather 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and you were just a child :) |pg||
nt|gracelin: a club lead will soon this 3NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gracelin: which south duly found.|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer has to guess the @d to make this contract|pg||
nt|twcho: the lead didn't trouble him|pg||

nt|gracelin: the double is trying to scare opponents away the right contract.  I saw this happen many times.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|twcho: sorry|pg||
nt|twcho: 9 tricks probably|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s, 2@c, 2@h and 1@d|pg||

pc|c2|nt|twcho: may get an overtrick in the end play|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|andyv:  re|pg||
nt|gracelin: can understand why south didn't double 2H to show 3-card S.  He opened on 10 counts and has good hearts.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S basically was one and done|pg||
nt|gsper:  Patrick, a few days ago there was a discussion about when the Precision 2@D was...|pg||
nt|gsper:  extended to distributions like 3415. Do you know?|pg||
nt|gracelin: north probably has seen partner open light, or he might double 2H to compete in any of the other 3 suits.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I know the method but not the discussion|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gracelin: he was our captain many times, once in Bermuda Bowl and twice in Team lympiad.|pg||

nt|gsper:  Ty.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: good spots in the E hand |pg||

nt|gracelin: Hi Jeanine|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are either up very early or staying up very late |pg||
nt|baldjean: born and grew up in the USA though|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no entries and such a weak suit, W would have been better off to lead partner's known 5 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  so only a 2 imp loss although we don't know how the play went here|pg||
nt|gracelin: north could beat by return a trump when get in with his H7|pg||
nt|gracelin: i fact west has better not to lead HJ, but a small H if north split an honor, it's more likely he has both.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|baldjean: +1 only? so declarer too kno chances in @h, despite East's bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: took no chances*|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|1H|nt|baldjean: the latter|pg||
nt|gracelin: from each 8-team group, only the top two will aualify for the finals.  |pg||
nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|twcho: so the score became closer|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: EW is probably playing precision too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gracelin: a boring 3NT, probably.|pg||
nt|gracelin: qualify|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S was doubled in other room and made 3 overtricks on D lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: thie is one of the quarter final matches. 32 boards in 2 segments.|pg||
nt|twcho: Fanhua is not without chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: match is getting closer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I think we have to guess at some of these, Jean|pg||
nt|gracelin: This HK team is the same that represent HK in the PABF in KL.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|twcho: which strategy will you choose with North hand, bid @c or bid @h only, Patrick?|pg||
nt|gracelin: the slam in closed room is doomed.  6C has better chance but will also fail when the spade K is wrong.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I don't think EW will be that ambitious here|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c shows a 6th club and no 4 card major|pg||
nt|gracelin: West may be slam minded after a raise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: CR north responds 1@s to partner's opening 1@d, quite an interesting choice|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess so.  Wang in West is the sponsor of the Fanhua (Pan China) team.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  this will be an easy make as the lead will give E three tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 3H bid gives declarer lot of information in the play.|pg||
nt|gracelin: ths is the last match of the RR from group B.  Both teams are unlikely to qualify for the finals starting tomorrow.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now the penalty will get almost as much as the Vul. slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: more so when East found a cue bid with his sub-mnmum|pg||
nt|andyv:  a third club would be useful for that endeavor|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 4H would be a lucky make but I can agree East's pass|pg||
nt|twcho: and here south chose to rebid 2@d rather than showing his pointless @s suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: China's national team is in group D, Hongkong's national team is in group C.  They lost to Ji Li last match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: but with bad breaks in H and C, don't see how declarer can come to 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: the 32 teams in the 4 groups will play RR within the group.  Top two teams from each group will quaify for the 8 team fina in the two last days.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N must have paid his insurance policy to be able to bid 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 2S but south bid spade first.|pg||
nt|gracelin: don't like 3C on a defensive balanced hand.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: defender is trying to set up cross-ruff opportunity.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Tommy Cho|pg||
nt|twcho: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and hello to you, Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Tommy and Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and all specs|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: North likes 2D more .|pg||
nt|twcho: and 2@dX is not too risky too|pg||
nt|gracelin: trump lead may hold declarer to 3D and 2 Aces for -3|pg||
nt|twcho: even making will lose 180|pg||
nt|gracelin: and north knows it's won't|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: defenders can win another 2H, 1S and 1C, so the contract will probably be made.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he will learn to be more cautious next time after he saw partner's 3S here.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gracelin: on the other hand, declarer can eatablish 2S, 3C and 2D for 7 tricks.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Well - it worked. Especially if he had got a @S lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5H is ok even on spade lead.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: turning a likely plus score to a minus one.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  nice inference taken by declarer in @c suit|pg||
nt|twcho: some will open with east hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|gsper:  Right.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but East may also take the finesse incase south has two Duaminds only and two trumps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's unlucky for declarer that both SA and CK are in wrong places|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|gracelin: Group A is the VIP group including sponsors and other VIP's.   |pg||
nt|twcho: This is an invitational event held in Shenzhen|pg||
nt|gracelin: South is better not to cover, but he doesn't know declarer has 5H|pg||
nt|twcho: 32 teams competing|pg||
nt|twcho: divided into 4 groups|pg||
nt|twcho: but passing is normal|pg||
nt|gracelin: they are Precisioners.  Maybe they need 4D to open 1D on 1st/2nd seat.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|twcho: welcome back|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer will try spade firs|pg||
nt|gracelin: first|pg||
nt|andyv:  can declarer partially strip hand down and lead @s to 10?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|twcho: top 2 teams of each group enter into the KO stage|pg||
nt|twcho: impossible to go down|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: Sun and Kang's misfortune on board 4 (800 in 4S X) gave away 12 imps.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: Patrick said earlier the main sponsor is playing at the other table |pg||
nt|gracelin: In this way the VIP's are assred of two berths in the final. |pg||
nt|gracelin: I came late but the Open Team has a useful lead.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, could be|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|Vugraphzgs: N very glad to X that contract :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: guess it's -1|pg||
nt|gracelin: the H finesse is risky and unnecessary, can go down if south has singleton D and 2 little H.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't think he has enough entry to do that.  Good idea|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|gracelin: if declarer overtake S10 and draw south's trump|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: Mr. Chen |pg||

nt|baldjean: tomorrow, or rather today meanwhile, is a holiday in Germany (reunification day), so I can sta up late|pg||

nt|twcho: we will see score correction soon|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's takeout to 5H is also questionable.  Partner's double of 4S indicated he held balanced hand rather than long minor.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Li will not be happy.|pg||
nt|twcho: not sure what is the min. no. of @d east guarantees by his 1@d opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|twcho: OK, corrected|pg||
nt|twcho: tks|pg||
nt|twcho: I doubt whether west shd correct to 2@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: the lagging team will need some more swing hands to have a chance.|pg||
nt|twcho: a potential slam hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 3C is the limit for NS here.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gracelin: guess it's 3.|pg||
nt|twcho: of course it is a poor slam but it will make with perfect guess|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed, but always difficult to bis a slam after opponents open the bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: EW didn't enter the bidding last board after south opened 1NT.  So EW actuat\lly won 7 imps by missing the 4H game.|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@d is probably multi|pg||
nt|gsper:  That is the drawback of having shown nothing about your distribution before the 5 level.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: I meant at other table.|pg||
nt|twcho: showing either M|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin:  thought last hand a routine 3NT, but Shanxi reached 5C there to give the host team 10 imps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Fanhua has a chance to get a revenge here.|pg||
nt|twcho: Here, 1@d promise 3+|pg||
mb|3C|nt|twcho: 2NT is game try|pg||
nt|twcho: and asking|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@h showing @s presumably|pg||
nt|gracelin: here East is definitely slam minded, but when West shows club rather than spade, he may settle down in game only.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3S and 4S may end the auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: guess North will XX|pg||
nt|twcho: SOS|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N didn't quite get the auction he was hoping for|pg||
nt|twcho: they can find 43 fit now|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting for south to bid 1@h instead of 1@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS have 7-card in both majors, and breaking 3-3 n both.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS maybe playing Precision.  The 1H opening is limited to 15 HCP, so he can jump to 3C which is not forcing.|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: EW can make 3D|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will surely bid game with his maximum.  just a choice of game and I guess N will pick 4S|pg||
nt|twcho: 3NT has no chance|pg||
nt|twcho: with no entry and a void, North will probably retreat to 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: north can see that he has no entry for the long spade unless south has SA.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 7H by dropping south H10, but 6H is a sound contract anyway.|pg||
nt|twcho: EW are young players based in Shenzhen while NS are veteran partners based in Beijing|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand totally useless to S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 3N will be making for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 3NT so even -2 or -3 is not disaster.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but considering the status of the match, EW should really push harder when the opportunity comes.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if West is willing to compete to the 3-level, why not a Michael 2H over 1NT to tell his whole story.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gracelin: in reality, however, south maybe pushed to 4C if East bid a prompt 3D.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|baldjean: probably 1 OT because of @h lead|pg||
nt|twcho: 1NT is 13-15 I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 3C will play less well.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Shanxi Qinlian is from the province Shanxi.  The world ladies champion HL Wang used to play in this team.  Wang is from SHanxi. |pg||
nt|twcho: a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|twcho: east holding @sJ so there is no risk of going down here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Club ruff will beat this.  Very nice lead |pg||
nt|gsper:  It seems that NS do not play Precision.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't blame south for jumping to game.  He is entitled to play partner for at least one useful card.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  in CR, N did not bid immediately and came in with 2@d bid over S's dbl of 1NT |pg||
nt|gracelin: South was to bid after XX but tried 1H first to see if  it can escape a double.  |pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: to bid 1S|pg||
nt|gracelin: the hand West went down in 3NT playing H honors to split, was made in closed room for 10 imps to Shenzhen.|pg||

nt|gracelin: might make 4 on D lead|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|gracelin: I agree with that.|pg||

nt|gracelin: West's jump to 4H maybe premature. could cue 2S, then East 3D, West 3H, East cue 3S, and maybe slam will be reached.|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe, but N certainly did not have to bid...so maybe judgment handles it best|pg||
nt|twcho: what is the greatest recovery you have ever seen in one segment, Patrick?|pg||
nt|twcho: a set I can remember is that Nickell is trailing Jacobs by 71 imps going into the final segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: agree. Inferior play in view of defensive line|pg||
nt|gracelin: likely 3NT for NS.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|twcho: and they win by 82 imps in the final segment|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the weak NT got EW in trouble on board 5 as they went down 500 in a @s partial|pg||
nt|twcho: EW playing precision|pg||
nt|twcho: north hand is too strong to pass probably|pg||
nt|gracelin: not sure if NS can reach 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  on last 10 count hand, S simply bid 2 non forcing @s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gracelin: Zhejiang Jinfan used to be one of the 3 leading bridge clubs in China.  However, their anchor pair Lian-Shi is playing on China Open Team this time.|pg||
nt|andyv:  same bid...so they don't see this as an invite hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: this 2S is NF so it's up to north to move on|pg||
nt|gracelin: on the other hand, if south bid 2D followed by a spade bid, it's forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may simply bid 3@c here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 4H for EW|pg||
nt|twcho: which is very popular system in China|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT seems to be some sort of a D raise.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Finding 5@C is rather impressive.|pg||
nt|gracelin: The China National team is going to Netherland for Bermuda Bowl in mid Oct.  This is their last tournament before the world championships.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: EW is cold for 4H but NS can sacrifice in 4S for -2 and a small profit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe West had played DA on the D lead and operaor made it DK.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 2@c = both M or S+C|pg||
nt|gracelin: they just completed a 10 days training before this.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, in Shenyang|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: sure West will balance with 3S|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, that's my memory, too.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|twcho: will 2NT bury any possible M fit?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, especially comparing to this table.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now north clarify he has the blacks, but does south know which is longer?  seems not.|pg||
nt|twcho: judging from the 3@c bid, they don't|pg||
nt|andyv:  a pretty frigid 3NT missed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: he would also bid it with singleton spade and an average hand.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe north should find a bid over 1C at non-Vul.|pg||
nt|twcho: but his venture will not be successful|pg||
nt|gracelin: so south cannot move on either|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gracelin: possible, but he is facing a strong 1C opening so game is not in his planning.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if it's uncertain then I would rather be in 2S, at least it's one level lower.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: declarer will take 3S + 2H + 1D + 3C while defenders can only have 2H + 2C.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: CA takes, and 3 round of spade will follow|pg||
nt|gracelin: probably need a D lead to beat this and East found it.|pg||
nt|twcho: and I could tell you, all the spectators. Jacobs team didn't do silly things in the final segment|pg||
nt|twcho: So everything can happen in bridge|pg||
nt|gracelin: though declarer can still make it by winning DA, CA pitches D then SQ to force a cover, now S10 and home.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 3NT so if declarer can hold this to -3, the damage is not too big.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S looked like he overbid initially in CR in order to get to 5@c|pg||
nt|twcho: more hands you want to assign to your bidding, the more ambiguous it is|pg||
pc|c8|nt|twcho: a good lead again|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, 1@d may be mean to be just some noise over the strong @c|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  some work to be done on this contract|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: defender better knock out the HK now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gracelin: south can get his club ruff later but can't beat 3S still.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|gracelin: The China Open Team for the Bermuda Bowl is in group D.  Hongkong also has a team here in group C.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|twcho: yes, has to guess the trump |pg||
pc|h9|nt|twcho: 4 down is possible|pg||
nt|gracelin: In these 2-suiter situatuion, most play major to be the longer one.|pg||
nt|gracelin: will make 5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gracelin: declarer will be lucky to find Diamond behave.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S might have preserved the A@d for a later entry to hand if @hs get established|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|twcho: likely 2 down|pg||
nt|gracelin: as 2S also went down in closed room.  No big deal how many down here.|pg||
nt|twcho: lucky that they are NV|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: on the other hand, their side is cold for 4D.  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|twcho: he did it swiftly|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gsper:  3@C was bold, but he could expect a good fit.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|twcho: but I think east can double 3@c|pg||
nt|twcho: impressive|pg||
pc|hT|nt|twcho: but probably east will be endplayed|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer should take 3 more for -3|pg||
nt|twcho: so 3 down most likely|pg||
nt|twcho: east can't score 3 trump tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: of course, if East now find the D shift, declarer will be scared.  if he ducks, he goes down.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  quite often the 9 is lead from 10 9 x (x, x, etc)|pg||
nt|andyv:  it shows the 10 and nothing higher or may be the top of a sequence|pg||

nt|andyv:  EW should get to the 4@h game|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: yes; I would have used K@d too|pg||
mb|1H|nt|twcho: 2 singleton K offside in this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: An easy 4S here.  Even if south insist on playing Heart, 4H is also ok.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: it seems he has a guess of East holding J9 or 98.  But West may not cover SQ with K8x in case declarer has AJ10xxxx.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|baldjean: N/S open 4-card majors?|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, just a 3rd hand variation.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he Hongkong team is the team that represented at the last PABF and almost won a berth for the ermuda Bowl.|pg||
nt|gracelin: They are Sam Wan, Derek Zen, Dicky Lai and KF Mok.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS play 16-18 1NT, So north might 1D here, unless he upgrade the hand to 16 HCP.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Heng Yuan Xiang crrent;y lying 5th in the group and 11 VP behind 2nd place.  They would have an outside chance to qualify with a big win here.|pg||
nt|gsper:  NS can sac in @D, but are not likely to find it.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gracelin: yes, he did for his 4 honor tricks.|pg||
nt|gracelin: so he plays West to start with KJx rather than K8x.|pg||
nt|twcho: and CR east find the killing low @h lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: lets try again now |pg||
nt|gracelin: rehi|pg||
nt|baldjean: 7@s on a finesse here|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS might make 4H unless West finds a club opening lead.|pg||
nt|twcho: and the defense finds the perfect defense to set 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H by East should end the aucyion|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: guess it;s north that bid 1NT|pg||
nt|twcho: NS can make 4M if guessing the @s while EW can make 4@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: many would open 1NT with the East hand.  If it goes 1NT  3NT, south will lead a diamond for an easy make.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  looks like several slams make here|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS is conducting a typical Precision sequence.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: of course, east is not done yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: south wanted to bid 2.5 H|pg||
nt|twcho: i will bid 3@h with south hand|pg||
nt|twcho: with such powerful hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H is an easy make|pg||
nt|gracelin: nice underlead but declarer can see no advantage not covering|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: West may just find the club lead under the bidding.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|twcho: @s lead is quite aggressive|pg||
nt|twcho: but other lead is not appealing too|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, with as little as West has, they are cold for 10 tricks in D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but guess north's 4C will buy the hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: unless north venture  2NT over 2H, possible at this Vul.|pg||
nt|gracelin: the impressive play by Li on last hand won his team 10 imps.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i guess not:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer should be aware that south has CA when club is not continued.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|twcho: with the partial fit in @s and strong trump holding|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, closer to 3H than 2H, with the spade fit.|pg||
nt|twcho: west initial pass and then double may show a better hand than a direct double|pg||
nt|twcho: over strong @c|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 4@s is cold as there is no entry to dummy for @s finesse|pg||
nt|twcho: while if in 4@h, declarer has a losing option|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|baldjean: won't be bid though. probably 6@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: because the alternatives are not appealing either.|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead to hold it to 4|pg||
nt|gracelin: Need to be more aggressive at fav. Vul. in order not to miss sacrifice opportunity with big fit.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|gracelin: we think the same  but you types faster.:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: seems West cannot double 2S as t/o, though he has denied to have spade with his 1NT resp.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  5N= pick a slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: West makes sure he gets his 3rd trick instead of trying to establish a 4th.|pg||
nt|gracelin: seem to lose 1S and 2C only.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: don;t think declarer dare to take double finesse in trumps to risk a club ruff|pg||

pc|h3|nt|twcho: good prediction|pg||

nt|twcho: with NS only bidding one suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|gracelin: in my view, north is timid not to compete to 4C.  The Qx of D are bad, but if he had Qx in Heart, he should try for game after 3C.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D is still makingm though.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer intends to take one more H, 2C and 2 trumps.  When CQ drops, declarer will make 4.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|andyv:  quick claim|pg||
nt|twcho: he finds the solution. Maybe the @c6 helps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: of course declarer has more to think about.  He doesn't know CJ is on side.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|twcho: the @d discard has deprived declarer of one trick|pg||
nt|gracelin: His line is not witout risks, he plays the short club hand to be long in trumps, reasonable.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: Closed room EW overbid to 4H when East opened a Vul. Vs. none 2H with 4 pts.|pg||

nt|twcho: seems cold|pg||
nt|twcho: 6 imps back|pg||
nt|gracelin: but only 7 boards left|pg||
nt|twcho: as CR NS buy the contract in 4@c|pg||
nt|twcho: double first or?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Another likely flat board, though the hands are not flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 1S  X  4S  5C will see south raise to 6C|pg||
nt|gracelin: or even 1S  X  3S  4C.|pg||

nt|gracelin: NS have lot of winners except the 4 Aces.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, definitely too strong for 4H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6S for NS on D finesse.  probably not biddable.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, with Heart 7-2.  I am just looking at the NS hands. :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: In the old days, one will cue 2D as a GF weapon.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|twcho: sorry, own hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1H showed spades.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gracelin: 3NT is reasonable but I will cue 4S with the south hand, and raise whatever minor suit north bids to slam.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand worth more than a 1@s bid over pd's double|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: will see another Precision action.  Don't thk they could stop in 3C afer the intervention.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gracelin: there are 4 natural losers and maybe another from a club overruff.|pg||
nt|twcho: not a hand EW want to see|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, wasted one board.|pg||
nt|twcho: time is running out|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|twcho: west has no entry after declarer ducks one round|pg||

nt|gracelin: The SF will start right after this match, or 80 minutes from now.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzgs: wow... |pg||
nt|gracelin: mabe 4C, still ok|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi Ji Chang Da gained 7 imps by competing to 4D in cloosed room on the hand West made 3S here.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gracelin: West may shiftnow, which makes the hand an open bok.|pg||
nt|twcho: EW is probably also playing precision|pg||
nt|gracelin: I would have overcalled 1S with the north hand though his tactic works.|pg||
nt|twcho: isn't that double of 2@h should promise black suits|pg||
pc|c6|nt|twcho: don't know what he will do if partner bids 3@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, north is probably prepared to correct 3C to 3D.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: this is tough one |pg||
nt|twcho: The ladies are more aggressive. CR NS are ladies|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1NT is making.  Defenders can only take 3S, 2H and either a D or club.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't understand why East didn't simply raise 2S (too good?) but choose double to get his side to 3-level.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@s likely make for EW|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: even thinking gives declarer useful info.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: guess this must be 12 imps to Shou Chuang.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gracelin: declarer need to use SA as entry to finesse DK immediaely to dispose the H loserm and establish a liong one for spade discard.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the question or point made by specs is that the dbl may show @cs or some other card combination.  I agree and still think the E hand is worth a 2@s bid unless E is just trying to bail out|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway NS won't have to worry about playing 3@h here|pg||
nt|gracelin: I would always take the low road when partner is a 3rd hand opening.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|twcho: 4 aces to lose|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's never a good idea to be pushed to game after a balancing action.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: both have played for China Ladies team before.  In fact, Yen in closed room south, was a Venice Cup Champion in 2009.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|twcho: 3 imps to EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: though I have sympathy with north.  All he needs is Axxxx of trumps.  Maybe he could raise 2S to 3S earlier.|pg||
nt|twcho: but 4@s probably not a high expectation. only require to find partner with Axxxx in @s and it will be a nice contract|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|twcho: the lead directing double backfires unexpectedly for North|pg||

nt|gsper:  Support double?|pg||

nt|sybarra: yes then can pitch the ht |pg||
pc|cT|nt|twcho: better to overtake when @c10 appears|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: since he will lose 3 trump tricks with the 4-1 break, though declarer doesn't know yet.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h5|nt|twcho: and with his shapely hand, 4@s will be a good sacrifice|pg||
pc|s7|nt|twcho: he can have one more entry to dummy then|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: well done indeed, maybe north should play DK on second Diamondplay.|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow |pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer should play trump before this.|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a nicely done I think|pg||
nt|twcho: The standard of female bridge players in China is very high because they always compete with the top male competitors in various events|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: the speed of the D return dictates whether East has a singleton or doubleton, though West should not make use of that.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|nt|gracelin: north will take his 7 tricks.|pg||
nt|twcho: can declarer guess the @h?|pg||
nt|twcho: if he does, he can hold his loss to 200 only|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: still ok.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|andyv:  it certainly would be a different way to play it.  I think Patrick is right...E thought hand was worth a limit raise, hence the double.|pg||
mc|6|nt|twcho: unlike other countries, most of the female players don't have enough exposure to high level competition|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgs: i never thought everyone should run after X over 2@D on previous board|pg||
nt|baldjean: why throw away a @c?|pg||
nt|twcho: another partial battle|pg||
nt|gsper:  Typically yes, but there are a number of variants around.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in closed room West ovecalled 1H and was passed back to south who should regret his decision to reopen and get double for 800 at te end.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: 2 nt minors |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|gracelin: 5C is there, but does N knows south is so distributional|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4H depends on the D guess.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: if south bids again, north will raise to game|pg||
nt|twcho: it has become rare to play 16-18 NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW needs to stop as low as possible.  Cards are not lying well for them.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gracelin: yes, but they also open sound.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: D lead will help solve the issue|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: the alert seems to indicate the opening is a multi, i.e. S + minor.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks polish|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: for teams not able to qualify for the KO, they will play Swiss Teams and the round robin result will be carry to the next stage for them|pg||
nt|gsper:  Multi? That kind of bid has a lot of names around the world.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they do allow 5-4 for the opening, then maybe south should just pass 2S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 40% actually will be carried forward to the Swiss|pg||
nt|gracelin: if declarer play SA to be on side, then he can discard dummy's 3rd D on good clubs.|pg||
nt|twcho: still he has to guess to finesse in @d or @s|pg||
nt|twcho: suppose S will return a @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: with all lower honors in defender hands and no spade lead, it's likely that north is holding SA, though not certain.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: EW play advancer's change of suit forcing (1S here), thus the 2D continuation.|pg||
nt|twcho: I wonder whether 2@d should promise more than a bare minimum overcall|pg||
nt|gracelin: East took the wrong moment to create a swing.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gracelin: no, a non-reverse new suit just shows hand pattern and not promising more.|pg||
nt|twcho: he is not listening to you. :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but I agree with his decision. Ddown 40 with 6 boards to go, must do smething.|pg||
nt|gracelin: no matter how declarer struggles, he is not going to make this one.  though it could go -3, -2 is my guess.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|twcho: OK, tks|pg||
nt|twcho: EW has reached the normal 3NT|pg||
nt|twcho: only 6 top tricks in sight|pg||
nt|gracelin: I meant East|pg||
nt|andyv:  polish 2@s= 5@s and 4+ of other, not @hs|pg||
nt|gsper:  Muiderberg in Holland.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, this is a good hints|pg||
nt|gracelin: here south is sure to return a Diamond, but he doesn't want to play it too fast. |pg||
nt|twcho: does the tempo of playing back a @d creates UI|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: snce he is likely to have a natural trump trick, hw could also be genuinely consider foa a club shift.  All break-in-tempo maybe subject to UI.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: 3NT is the best contract here.  |pg||
nt|andyv:  Unknown in the US:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gracelin: declarer is hoping for 1S + 3D + 3C, but will be disapponted when club breaks 4-1|pg||
nt|twcho: Running score can be found at http://ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=1323|pg||
nt|gracelin: now defenders are ahead for 2S, 2H, 2D and 1C|pg||
nt|gracelin: but on first trick, it's allowed more time to think over the whole hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: the failing to return a D may make declarer believe south has DQ.|pg||
nt|twcho: but the leader to the next trick should not be so tempo sensitive as he is considering which suit to attack. This does not apply to the 2nd hand or 3rd hand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucas or Tartan 2 in UK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|gracelin: but south found the best lead of a Diamond which will probably beat it.|pg||
nt|twcho: south did find the best lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
mc|10|nt|gracelin: a D continuation will force dummy to duck, the a Club shift beats 3NT|pg||
nt|twcho: but declarer may still make|pg||
nt|twcho: Before this round starts, NS here is leading while EW are lying 6th|pg||
nt|twcho: anyway, no double no trouble|pg||
nt|gracelin: believe the fate of this match is casted so  will leave the rest to you, Tommy.  Thanks everyone and see you again in a while.|pg||

nt|andyv:  on board 9, the excellent @s slam was not reached in the CR|pg||
nt|andyv:  here 4@s seems pretty routine|pg||
nt|baldjean: unless E/W have ambitions. after W sgows @s fit E may get ideas|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after taking DA declarer should cash his winner before exit with HJ.  He still make if D is 6-2, but go down only 1 if D are 5-3|pg||
nt|twcho: so instead of one down, now he is 3 down|pg||
mb|1C|nt|twcho: the result shows that declarer makes his contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Patrick|pg||
nt|baldjean: shows*|pg||
nt|twcho: 1NT is perhaps the most complicated contract with both sides of about equal strength|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a routine 3NT for NS.  H lead will be threatening but declarer will prevail.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|twcho: so he must guess correctly at the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: our first slam|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gracelin: once West shows long spade, East cannot be stopped in game.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4NT and one key-card will do the work.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, that's the best line catering for making chance and only going one down at most|pg||
nt|gracelin: East has a lot of defense for his 4C bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I need to go and thanks all.  See you guys tomorrow at the finals.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but it is just impossible for the defense to gather enough setting tricks as the cards lie|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|twcho: with @c 33 and defenders @h 44, nothing can hurt declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1NT is easy so national team will take over the lead after this board.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 3D prbably show a maximum weak 2S|pg||
nt|twcho: north opening is somewhat not complying iwth their CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: there will be four 16 boards matches today and 3 tomorrow to complete the 8 team RR in every group.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  E has a monster hand opposite the multi|pg||
nt|gracelin: while 3S shows a minimum 2S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gracelin: 6S is also a practical bid.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|twcho: but 4@s probably make|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S maybe making with the help of the 4C bid so 5C is a cheap save.|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, just threatening.|pg||
nt|twcho: CC states 5+ or 4414|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|gracelin: Guess north will not follow S10 if he doesn't have H10 together with the K.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|twcho: 2@c is artificial|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|twcho: does not promise @c|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3 round of D wll hold the contract to 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  reverse W's minor suit holdings and 6 would be in the picture|pg||
nt|baldjean: see?|pg||
nt|gracelin: South need to lead D originally to save the SK entry for a D ruff.|pg||
nt|twcho: 3NT would be easy here with the favorable lie of cards|pg||

nt|gracelin: stiff|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, a 9-card suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  board 10 was 13 imps to EW when 4@h made 5 in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 3NT by north is probably where this hand will rest.|pg||
nt|gracelin: some modernest may only overcall 2C with the south hand.  Then north must find a bid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S dbles now |pg||
nt|sybarra: or bid 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|gracelin: There is a line between t/o double and simple overcall.  South hand is a little too strong for me to only overcall.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW only has partial in spades here, but easy to reach a spade game.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|baldjean: precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I wonder what S expects to do with the double?  Spend the rest of the auction trying to convince N he really has none of the other suits?|pg||
nt|twcho: Patrick, will you opt for double if east hand is with one @c less and one @d more?|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS can make 4@d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gracelin: south is from Eric Kokish's school and north is from the same school.|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have bid 5@d over 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  right, but he had to assume that the Q of @s was with S since N didn't ruff with the Q|pg||
nt|gracelin: south in closed room chose 5C which I agree.|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|andyv:  that seems sensible|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@s can be defeated by double dummy defense|pg||
nt|twcho: so the CR result is the par|pg||
nt|gracelin: as it is, 3NT will win 2 imps for the same 11 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Double, I might even double with this actual hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south's double scared EW to bid their spades. |pg||
nt|gsper:  b|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|sybarra: bet we missed a pass |pg||
nt|twcho: not everyone act with south hand|pg||
nt|twcho: with all the quacks|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  it was a guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and foolish N thinks partner has suits for the double|pg||
mb|6H|nt|twcho: the 4@d has shut out the game contract for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: but sppose north opened on xx  x  Qxx  KQJxxxx, 3NT would be terrible.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: but declarer has no intermedate sot for any finesse|pg||
nt|gracelin: spot|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@c seems makeable|pg||
nt|twcho: now west need to find the @d lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: the @d become worthless in @ss|pg||
nt|gracelin: the cards are not lying well for declarer so the 22 pts 1NT is not a sure thing yet.|pg||
nt|twcho: leading from Q10xx normally a better choice than from AJ9x, especially against 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  that is rather amusing|pg||
nt|andyv:  S still thinking|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: for 1NT, the quacks are just as fines.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  true...I was only curious as to what E was thinking when N didn't ruff with the Q|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry, north is the declarer|pg||
nt|twcho: now the chance has gone|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|gracelin: south found the most damaging lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this time Qx does not work as a stopper|pg||
nt|gracelin: the slam depends on the D finesse, it works here.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: But did south's long huddle before bdding 2C give north some hint?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|gsper:  2@H vul would not have occurred to me, but it worked.|pg||
nt|twcho: west can never get the @d ruff|pg||

pc|hA|nt|andyv:  yes, E can't play @hs on his own|pg||
nt|gracelin: north not ruffing with Q1098 ?|pg||
nt|twcho: better to strip the @c by using trump as entry|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|gracelin: better cash SA now or will lose it.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shanxi won a swing last board.  The other room also in 4C but went down.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, declarer has 6 tricks now.  both sides are fighting for the 7th tricks.|pg||
nt|gracelin: spade is declarer 7th trick|pg||
nt|twcho: another 3 imps to the leader|pg||

pc|h9|pc|d3|pc|hJ|nt|baldjean: why double when trump suit is clear?|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: East did not hear me and lose his SA.|pg||
nt|gracelin: closed room if 5-board behind.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: right|pg||
nt|twcho: in bd 10, the auction is exactly the same until east double the 3NT and north scared and run to 4@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: this should be an easy 4S for EW, both in bidding and play.|pg||
nt|twcho: and lose 10 more imps|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S seems inevitable but is not making with HA wrong|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gracelin: NS's 4H depend on the location of DA, but EW can make 4S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't see why he did that.  He should not be ashamed of his double of 3H with AK, A and a 5-card suit. |pg||

nt|twcho: can NS equal the CR result here?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: will S bid spades |pg||
nt|twcho: and 4@c is not guaranteed to be a good contract either|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3H is a cue of opponent's implied H suit.  It shows invitationa or better hand for spade.|pg||
nt|twcho: 6@s or 6N are both cold|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: they are behind the time schedule|pg||
nt|gracelin: there is a 20 minutes break after 1st half.  2nd half of SF will start in 45 minutes from now.|pg||
nt|gracelin: of course, we have 2 more boards to go here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N a decent contract|pg||
nt|twcho: 6N by north will be best|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, 4C will be too high, but may also push NS into the unmaking 4S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will surely pass 3 if East didn't compete, but now he is tempted.|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone has to hear the screeching of brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks as if EW will be shut out of bidding|pg||
nt|twcho: don't know whether time penalty will be enforced|pg||
nt|twcho: redouble force opener to bid 2@c it seems|pg||
nt|gracelin: north will shift to Q as soon as he takes his CA|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|gracelin: I'd love to make most of my 3NT contract better. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: both 3N or 4@s makeable for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: most will open 2NT with West hand.  here the 1D opening allows him to play one level lower.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|gracelin: yes, if NS can make 4S, north would have bid it over 3C.|pg||
nt|twcho: so another tie bd|pg||

nt|andyv:  perhaps E could have doubled 2NT|pg||
nt|twcho: good stop. even 5@s is dangerous|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gracelin: -2 is ok since NS is likely to make 3S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's Cue is just in case West has a strong raise hand, which West didn't have.|pg||

nt|twcho: and he may also play 2 rounds of top trumps and then discard dummy's @d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  an easier 3N for EW here|pg||
nt|twcho: and ruff a @d in dummy but this involve some risk of 41 trump break|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and how high will this get?|pg||
nt|twcho: Probably the wealthy sponsors can sign some US or European top profs for their Club A teams|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: I am not saying that EW will find their 4S after that, but EW could be missing a 5-4 or even 5-5 spade fit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting on 14 that EW never got into the auction|pg||
nt|twcho: and I expect this will be coming|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS may end up in 3NT.  The right way to handle cubs is cashing A,K first.|pg||
nt|gracelin: probably another tied board in 4S +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: NS is close to 6S but not quite with trumps 3-1.  Let's see how will they go.|pg||
nt|gracelin: clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: though D lead and H shift may hold it to four.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  they may play it in 4@s|pg||
nt|twcho: the semi will start in 50 min from now|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: or a good fit in minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  since W will know the take out is on distribution, he may take the plunge with 4@s or 5@cs|pg||
nt|famus: ew will venture in 3NT--perhaps|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, might see it happen.  But not sure whether CCBL allows.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|baldjean: interesting that N opened in the other room on that board|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|gracelin: My guess is they will reach 6S and struggle for -1 in very slow play.|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would have liked to know the meaning of 3@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s will also make...3N a bit easier|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@s will likely go down|pg||
nt|gracelin: an easy 4S and probably a tied board.  Only one more board and Shenzhen has a chance to take over the lead if National team fails to bid the 50% slam on  board 13.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|twcho: I think China is quite flexible. :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|twcho: quite an unexpected bid by North|pg||
nt|twcho: looks like another bidding misunderstanding|pg||
nt|twcho: as I am told, west is the sponsor so the partnership may not be so solid|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they stop below 6?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looked like 2@s was going down at least 3 which isn't quite good enough because of the vul|pg||
pc|sK|nt|famus: wow-|pg||
nt|baldjean: was 2@d some kind of weak Flannery?|pg||
nt|twcho: with his great @c suit and mediocre support for @H|pg||
nt|gracelin: north is playing south for stronger H and weaker S, probably not warranted.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: don't thk so.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: this is not making.  South may lead C10 to ask for a spade return|pg||
nt|gracelin: or lead SK himself to ensure 4 tricks for defenders.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south has, say : Ax  AJ10xx  Axxx  xx, 4H maybe the winning contract.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  on 13 in CR?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is lucky for them that the @h breaks as friendly as possible|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: guess not |pg||
nt|baldjean: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi|pg||
nt|famus: -2 wud b a god score for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: DA and club now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gracelin: 5S maybe a general slam try and south does like his hand.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: The final will start 14 hours 30 minutes from now.  It will be 48 boards in 3 segments.|pg||

nt|andyv:  or, after the 2@s bid, again, 3@d might have gotten NS to 6|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, he takes a unilateral action.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: everytime EW ends up in a marginal game, they were duly punished|pg||
nt|gracelin: look like this last board is also flat|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4H making 4 or 5|pg||
nt|gracelin: So this match will be close for the 2nd half which will start in 40 minutes from now.|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s would already be too high for NS|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|twcho: by the accurate defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: The 5th match will start 14 hours from now. |pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: yes, I thk north is very conservative in choosing 3NT.  Double and a trump lead may beat 2S 1,100.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C could be either CAPP (one suiter) or suction (D, or both M's).|pg||
nt|twcho: tks Patrick for your great commentating. It is always enlightening|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Thank you, Tommy.  Nice to be with you, too.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: So the 6S was slowly -1 as expected.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: West will bid his major.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and south may compete in club, knowing partner is long there.|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board of this set|pg||
nt|twcho: this is the last bd of this segment|pg||
nt|twcho: next one will resume in 50 min time|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4s is the limit.  3 round of D will create a trump trick for defense|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Whome to steel what here? @DEW or @C - 3NT NS?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks all for watching, Also to my colleague Andy, the operator and the sponsor Nan Gong Dong Li.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Patrick and Li |pg||
nt|gracelin: actuall, West will of course lead a H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: NS might in fact make 5C, especially by south to avoid a H opening lead.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  want to thank everyone for participating |pg||
nt|andyv:  and esp. thank you to the specs for joining us. |pg||
nt|gracelin: so we will enter the second half with exactly tied score.  Final will be played in 3 segments tmorrow.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|famus: with @d9 with declarer--routine 4@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  last hand of this set|pg||
nt|twcho: this will be doubled|pg||
nt|twcho: much better judgment by Li than his counterpart in CR|pg||
nt|twcho: so a hugh lead for the National team|pg||
nt|twcho: Tks everyone for watching. Bye now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to see u all by the short visit. I had the CR|pg||
nt|gracelin: now CA pitches a H, CQ a D.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|famus: shud b a push|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you to Li, our operator|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ty Li, Andy and Pat (if you can hear us)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|baldjean: this will be down on the @c lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get a very difficult (setting) lead for declarer |pg||
nt|gracelin: don't see the meaning of 2D bid, would that help East to find the club lead ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and thank you to Jean and Hasan for their contributions|pg||
nt|andyv:  and above all, thank you to all the specs for joining us|pg||
nt|famus: Thanks evryone|pg||
nt|twcho: the pass is conservative|pg||
nt|twcho: by south|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT by north is making since East will be squeezed and endplayed.  But declarer needs t read cards well. |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: E  not listening?|pg||
nt|gracelin: East will have a second chance to find the club shift after winning HQ (or SK).|pg||
nt|gracelin: This is last board of the second match.  Next match will start in 75 minutes from now.  They played this set really fast, 16 boards in  one hour and 10 minutes.|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree...I don't think N could see that so simply took the money without investigating any further|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice efficient bidding to this slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Goran and Li|pg||
nt|andyv:  only question on this hand is how many overtricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: and must have found it|pg||
nt|baldjean: doesn't really matter. this can't make|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D is alerted, so maybe just a check-back action, but I don't see any advantage.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now last hand of set I think |pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks all for watching and my colleague in commentating.  Next match start in 90 minutes.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Patrick and Jean,   |pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks all go to our operator and the organizer, sponsor.  Hope the network will get better from now on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes hope so |pg||
nt|gracelin: bye for the moment.|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have almost 24x7 vugraph now,  from all over the world  will see you in another on soon |pg||
nt|gracelin: An easy slam to end the match.  Tks all specs, Andy and the operator.  Also the aponsor and the organizer.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|gsper:  I believe commentators are supposed to bet Diet Cokes on that.|pg||
nt|gracelin: defender will take their 2D but that is it|pg||
nt|gracelin: tks all specs, the operator, sponsor and oranizer for a wonderful tournament.|pg||
nt|gracelin: no more game tonight.  The final tomorrow will start 14 hours 20 minutes from now.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  ty Patrick and everyone for joining us|pg||
nt|gracelin: bye all.  See you in 35 minutes.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|twcho: he has more than enough winners to set the contract with his own|pg||
nt|gracelin: he needs to use HA to dummy to take D finesse, then runs all D.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|famus: so bd 15 might prove to be decisive|pg||
nt|andyv:  round 4 sceduled to start in about 50 minutes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: Thjere is a saying : If you like this contract, don't disturb it.  South may have learned.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
