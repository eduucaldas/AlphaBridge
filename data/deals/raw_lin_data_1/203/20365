nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: easy 4@H to start with |pg||
nt|othered1: A routine strong NT auction, perhaps, but today 4th seat 1N openers are relatively rare,  as someone finds a reason to open in front of them|pg||
nt|bobholl: p p p  1nt  p 2@D superaccept 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rado: hi all, welcome to round 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hey Rado,welcome :)|pg||
nt|rado: NS play precizion with 1NT showing @D suit as far as we meet last time in StZ|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone, this is the last round for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello every one|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: everyone|pg||
nt|rado: welcome to the final round|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: this is the last round|pg||
nt|rado: facing 1st and 2nd team so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yup|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rado: Israel leading by 21 vp's so they need 4 or 5 to won the event|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Dessy|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bobholl: good ed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: And south gets a psychic 1@D in.  Wonder if they play Precision style, where a 3rd seat 1@D psyche is almost free|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: and 1@D showing weak NT|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzre: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome all to Stara Zagora:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentator (alone so far) is Rado|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|rado: NS use precision with many scientific gadgets:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 2@S looks to be showing a @D fit as well as @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|rado: 10 teams, round robin 12 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hello Marshal|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome to you to|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck: wonder what 2N was for them|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently a raise of some kind looking at the 4@s rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Can west be t hinking?  Partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: zdr dessy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: info at:http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|rado: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far a very standard auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello :) to you too.. welcome|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H not showing length, as N is known to have a strong hand but did not reverse to 2@H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: this will be a very routine 5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: the results http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rado: first blood now , |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has already implied 5 spades but wishes to emphasize the suit due to its quality, and is not crazy about NT with no fit and some potential red- suit problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yeah:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good presume|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: going for some xruff maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: that may not work well if he loses 2@s, 1@h, 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, his best chance would be to get @d fin right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks to be a dull 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: simple 3 nt with 9 (or 10) tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|danilo1: 8 topp tricks ... but guess any lead by West will find ninth one (difficult to immagine @C lead)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: after 3S, though, the auction sort of petered out. both players have enough to try for slam. N despite the highcard minimum has a super hand with controls and a great suit and his ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: small doubleton in exactly the right place. S has 3 controls and a possible trick source and a potentially useful nine of clubs|pg||
nt|rado: Israel needs calm boards and Vito - wild ones:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|skjaeran:  Still onluy 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  *only|pg||
nt|danilo1: y|pg||
nt|psyck:  2 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome R@H|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not made (yet)|pg||
nt|psyck: not a great game with only 1 entry to dummy & not enough tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@H now is best|pg||
nt|psyck: would often go down even with @h fin on, & no chance here|pg||
nt|rado: 3@S makable and 3@H down one|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen really hit the best lead.|pg||
nt|psyck:  6 feet 9 inches|pg||
nt|psyck:  9.5|pg||
nt|granguru:  skov6.791338|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. since North shown 4-card @H ... not easy lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And good evening to GeO Tislevoll in New Zealand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|skjaeran:  Going down now.|pg||
nt|geot: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hello welcome|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rado: 1st board nothing unusuall|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck:  That was Skov's height, 6' 9,5"...|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Yes, he's a BIG guy.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|dT|nt|danilo1: starting with @C is strange play .. if 3-3, no need to hurry|pg||
nt|psyck: if it not a bad game either, with several chances|pg||
nt|rado: players do not see all 52 cards for down 2 like us|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SJ8HAKJ42DA876C95,SKQ972HQT86DKCAJ6,ST643H97DT932CT84,SA5H53DQJ54CKQ732|sv|n|nt|granguru:  here we see a typical hand where 3 hands are distributional and the 4th doest know about it|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently he did try the x ruff & went down as suspected|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on 6@H good save|pg||
nt|bobholl: and a likely push|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of room for differing actions on this  hand, beginning with east's possible opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of options for the auction here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam is of course very playable on the NS cards, and possibly makeable via a squeeze (or pseudo)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|vugraphzre: that what i see is ..auto squeeze :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|zebutin: mighty try even 7@D|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone know their 1N range?|pg||
mb|d|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: the correct side will start bidding @d soon :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like their  headed to a @S fit|pg||
nt|geot: super fit here for E/W. can make all the tricks in a @H contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lets see the contract :)|pg||
nt|rado: 2NT is INV only with fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
nt|rado: 11 tricks in @S double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
mb|2S|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
nt|gluckenval: hi all and welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hi there, welcome|pg||
nt|gluckenval: zdr Dessy|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rado: seems NS use natural methods, not precision sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a colossally strong hand for a multi in most partnerships, even red|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: intresting opening here|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but.. :) good contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/  updated after round 6. Israel in a very strong position|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Team Members http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/teams.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|rado: 5 or 7 hand depending on K@D:)|pg||
nt|geot: In slam - on a club lead, it is on the @D finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||
nt|rado: trump lead is good for defence but declarer still home with 3@C ruffs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Subhash Gupta|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: lead was easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: NV, may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome|pg||
nt|offthebend: hello everybody|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow not best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ running scores|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzre: sorry crazy mouse :)|pg||
nt|rado: pessimistic approach by W , many would splinter 3@S |pg||
nt|geot: yes, so might as well be in 7 rather than 6, or just game|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are many situations like this in fourth seat where you want to open but are afraid of being outbid so you open with a preempt which  in last seat is of course not weak. here ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: however that is a questionable strategy, because 2D probably wont keep them out of spades if they have them. meanwhile partner could be something like 4153 and you end in hearts ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps down with  110 or 130 to make in diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi there:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Congrats Marshall!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some sort of record?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You just set a new BBO record: 5 lines of commentary|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good point :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hihi|pg||
nt|offthebend: is that really a record :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only because the chatspace is so narrow:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||
nt|othered1: best defense likely would have started by south leading the long suit |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gmarco24: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: hi welcome|pg||
nt|gluckenval: correct play in @H... really unlucky for declarer.... but it happens... (25% of times, more or less :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: this is not the best play in @h, slight better is A@h, @h to Q, since you can lose 2 tricks on KJ behind if you play finesse twice|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|granguru:  claim time already|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about this line, as opposed to setting up a diamond, but with right view in hearts D wont be needed|pg||
nt|bobholl: n can't guess the 4@H in e :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: results|pg||
nt|offthebend: W has to duck this to hold it to 8 tricks|pg||

nt|psyck: Hi Sunil|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi CK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in San Marino, one of the smallest countries in the world|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Ed, Bob|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a  hand that big @C systems handle quite well.|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good 7@H and biddable if S can show his singleton @C|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Henry!|pg||
nt|bobholl: think any reasanoble line will let 4@S make|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Hristov is nervous,coz his p thinking so long abt this move|pg||
nt|geot: I agree Rado, If 2NT was defined as game invite only, I think West was a bit soft|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon !|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: welcome Hedy@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Dessy :)|pg||
nt|rado: hi Hedy welc|pg||
mb|1N|nt|granguru:  a small @c first improuves a little defense options|pg||
nt|Walddk2: San Marino is a state situated on the Italian peninsula on the eastern side of the Apennine Mountains. It is an enclave surrounded by Italy. Its size is just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with an estimated population of over 30,000. Its capital is the City of San Marino. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe|pg||
nt|aramesh: arranging commentators for european small federation games vugraph|pg||
nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rado Radev|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: raptor would be pretty to have in W |pg||
nt|bobholl: hi henry :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry N :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Welcome Rado@H|pg||
nt|offthebend: there could be some fireworks on this deal |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Rado:)|pg||
nt|offthebend: Hi rado |pg||
nt|hedyg: Rado :)|pg||
nt|rado: 6@H very cheap suppose no @D lead from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Not quite a 2@C bid, because  you run out of rebids pretty quickly|pg||
nt|phil: yes, declarer gets a good count on the hand when the 3rd diamond is played. I do think its stronger for North to duck that heart though, don;t you think? |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sunsamvar: BRAVE 1 NT BY e|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but it will make nevertheless|pg||
nt|geot: 3NT seems normal on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: P cud be yarborough|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: the results after round 3 3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some like sandwich NT (for other suits) & some like nat NT (since opps often open & respond light & steal you blind)...|pg||
nt|othered1: 7 is an excellent spot and may be biddable.  |pg||
nt|rado: W might use garbage stayman here |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: so many traps in here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: 3N by W looks good as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland has the 'R' convention closely trailing the F & G conventions in the list of avoidable ones|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt x on a @S  lead :) wouldn't have found that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: for the results|pg||
nt|offthebend: only makeable game is 3NT by West -- hard to get there |pg||
nt|rado: and probably will end in 3NT by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: @S guess solved now so will make|pg||
nt|phil: me neither :)|pg||
nt|phil: but even on a heart, there arent a lot of tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sunsamvar: 2@S transfer and 2nt acceptance|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: no 3nt |pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :P|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: true CK but still a brave bid at unfav vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: playing NT as nat in that position, I would also bid 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all, sorry i am late:):(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S had not an obvious pass for some of us|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes a 53 major suit fit is not the key to the city. here 5C is a much more comfortable spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy it looks like W can get home, but there is work to be done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as the cards lie, even 6C is more comfortable than 4S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has every reason to think long and carefully here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though soon we may start wondering if the screen door has been raised:)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Marko, I think this could help you : http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_4.htm|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: on their way to 7 i guess|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by W is only cold game, but 5C could easily succeed|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5C can be beaten only on S ruff now |pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck:  I play 1@s by E as 4+ cards & x with less|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now making as crucial entry got|pg||

nt|ntmon: good morning to everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: good morning|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
nt|othered1: This would be a v ery easy Blue Team Club auction, where south would show an ace and a king on his first response, then @H fit, then cue-bidding should focus on t he value of the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @SQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of chances for it though. ace of hearts lead will set it, or spade ace then heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of chances to set i mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: one down or two down ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one|pg||
pc|h9|nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
nt|geot: Not so many top-tricks here, will have to work well to get 9|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice arrival to proper contract|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@S-7@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller would reach this surely with their tarzan precision|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: N will cash heart ace to get a signal|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: 2, when S ruff..back @H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like NS play upside down then|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i am surprised that common problem is misunderstood|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/ results|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: needs to play @d now|pg||
nt|hedyg: will not be in dummy again|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ntmon: with all necessary info delivered by opps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if s still interested N has an easy 7 @H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: well done..|pg||
nt|henryb:  Whatever the bids meant, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while,  Bye for now.|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and play will present no problem with @S 32|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @H 31 is enough already|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or more to the point, @h 3-1|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|d4|nt|bobholl: even with @H 40 there are enough chances|pg||
nt|hedyg: not know about singleton A@D he is thinking 6@c was off right now|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobholl: S still can't calculate the @C J :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it's simple calculation: KJx(x) with N or S, A wins with one, Q wins with another- it's equal so far|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|gmarco24: but, with twice finesse you lose to KJ second behind, and there's no way to lose on 2-2 if you cash A|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: always aggravating when they ruff with a stiff trump:(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Bulgaria/trendafilov-karaivanov.pdf|pg||
nt|gmarco24: also, any singleton honor is ok  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: will be relieved later to find out it was making|pg||
pc|d9|nt|granguru:  using all kind of transfers at the one level in order to force overcaller to lead as much as possible|pg||
nt|danilo1: difficult to believe in this trick|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Indeed!|pg||
nt|danilo1: did it really happen?|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Suppose he's playing safe|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Against @ss 4-1.|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Keeping trump control this way.|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is safe -1 :)|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  -1IMP|pg||
nt|danilo1: srry,. @D are high ... |pg||
nt|offthebend: not for the defending side :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: claim :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Variable 1@C opening|pg||
