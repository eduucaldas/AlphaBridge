nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: easy 4@H to start with |pg||

nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
mb|d|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||

nt|psyck: NV, may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||

nt|Walddk2: We are in San Marino, one of the smallest countries in the world|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Ed, Bob|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a  hand that big @C systems handle quite well.|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good 7@H and biddable if S can show his singleton @C|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Henry!|pg||
nt|bobholl: think any reasanoble line will let 4@S make|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  a small @c first improuves a little defense options|pg||
nt|Walddk2: San Marino is a state situated on the Italian peninsula on the eastern side of the Apennine Mountains. It is an enclave surrounded by Italy. Its size is just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with an estimated population of over 30,000. Its capital is the City of San Marino. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bobholl: raptor would be pretty to have in W |pg||
nt|bobholl: hi henry :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry N :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Not quite a 2@C bid, because  you run out of rebids pretty quickly|pg||
nt|phil: yes, declarer gets a good count on the hand when the 3rd diamond is played. I do think its stronger for North to duck that heart though, don;t you think? |pg||
mb|2D|nt|sunsamvar: BRAVE 1 NT BY e|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but it will make nevertheless|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: P cud be yarborough|pg||
mb|2N|nt|psyck: some like sandwich NT (for other suits) & some like nat NT (since opps often open & respond light & steal you blind)...|pg||
nt|othered1: 7 is an excellent spot and may be biddable.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland has the 'R' convention closely trailing the F & G conventions in the list of avoidable ones|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt x on a @S  lead :) wouldn't have found that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: http://3bcc.neo-bridge.org/   |pg||

mb|3N|nt|bobholl: @S guess solved now so will make|pg||
nt|phil: me neither :)|pg||
nt|phil: but even on a heart, there arent a lot of tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 2@S transfer and 2nt acceptance|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: true CK but still a brave bid at unfav vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: playing NT as nat in that position, I would also bid 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all, sorry i am late:):(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S had not an obvious pass for some of us|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes a 53 major suit fit is not the key to the city. here 5C is a much more comfortable spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy it looks like W can get home, but there is work to be done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as the cards lie, even 6C is more comfortable than 4S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has every reason to think long and carefully here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though soon we may start wondering if the screen door has been raised:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: on their way to 7 i guess|pg||

nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
nt|othered1: This would be a v ery easy Blue Team Club auction, where south would show an ace and a king on his first response, then @H fit, then cue-bidding should focus on t he value of the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @SQ|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: 5@S-7@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller would reach this surely with their tarzan precision|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|bobholl: on @C lead also +2 otherwise +1|pg||
nt|henryb:  Palazo is a player after my own style, not opening that dreadful 12 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  need more than that|pg||
nt|bobholl: you can subract 1 point for 4333 and one for aceless agree totally|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I may have preferred some number of @c instead of the negative 1@d on the Strong @c opening|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is perhaps less objectionable if playing multi|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|psyck:  you have 3 @c's in hand to take care of|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Ruff two of them. You need @Ds to behave too.|pg||
nt|psyck:  and too much work to do as x ruff meands you may not get 2nd @d trick|pg||
nt|danilo1: logical decision by East ... @S shorthness is not encouraging|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|h3|nt|psyck: 1@c-3@c-3@h-4@h bidding also possible|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sunsamvar: enjoy the rest of the session all|pg||
nt|bobholl: after 1@H double they migth miss 4@S|pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@S for NS, and save in minor for EW?|pg||
nt|bobholl: who should open ? west for the lead ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: make your choice 1 2 3 4 @H or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, white on white...a little unusual but 11 card fits can do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: this is cheaper :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: yes, 1@h double a good idea at the vul & with passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the real criterion in such decisions is: if we do push the opps to 5H, are they likely to go down? if not, less attractoive to save, esp with 2 likely defensiove tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder how many pairs have 4@h to play in this situation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, i said that inside it:):(|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: yes...i must admit i couldn't have passed with Wests hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 5@H is cheap |pg||
nt|marlowepi: not ao cheap if opps bid 6D|pg||
nt|phil: 1 looks sort of obvious to me even if you play wide ranging preempts|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H goes for 800 so better pass :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that D by N. maybe 4H is better, planning to correct spades to NT for minors|pg||
nt|phil: with a void heart, its unlikely the w/r opponents are bidding 4@h, so maybe the mild overbid of 4N is best? |pg||
nt|phil: *likely|pg||
nt|phil: I think East will get away with 5@h here if he bids it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: inside out|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|skjaeran:  4@h looks like a better contract than 3NT.|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry even 6@H goes for only 500 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  4@h could make even if you get trumps wrong|pg||
nt|bobholl: only objection against double is only 3 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like any plan that strongly emphasizes the minors, as pd is likely to have a fit. i think the double was based on the fear that S had 18 balanced and that 3N was the only game. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: narrow target to try to hit|pg||
mb|4D|nt|skjaeran:  Can discard a spade on clubs.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 3@D would be forcing, ! would choose 3@D rather than jump to 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  right lead found|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@h must have shown an intermediate hand with 5@h & W was not interested in game opp less than strong @c opening values|pg||
nt|zebutin: and some might even bid with Easts hand something like balancing 1nt|pg||
mb|5C|nt|psyck: I can understand E not bidding as he expects vul opps to be in a misfit as pd did not x 1@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  but you were right, Marshall....the vul got to E|pg||

nt|granguru:  3@D is a slam invitation|pg||

nt|blewah: slam time|pg||
nt|bobholl: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/  thanks from a kibitzer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but club toward dummy is an extra chance at no cost|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems to be the normal thing to do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should be a big pickup as EW make 4S|pg||
nt|frangos007:  another very interesting hand|pg||
nt|ugis: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: NS will go down in some contract here i suppose|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless you have 2 timid rabbits sitting E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: auction might not go the same early|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|bobholl: 6@H in east is the optimum contract :)|pg||
nt|blewah: both pairs play big club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3Dmaking is likely outcome|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the trick is to stay only in 4@S|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia has taken an early lead here|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: luckily not possible to misguess @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW bid to 4@s, I think it's a good chance NS will go to 5@h|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chrisky: 6NT also....|pg||
nt|blewah: exclusion rkcb now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@D voidwood would be pretty now |pg||
nt|blewah: 5@d|pg||
nt|blewah: or yes 4@d, depending on their agreement|pg||
nt|bobholl: why 1 @S 3rd hand a multi or weak two looks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 1H ? why not X ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not my call but might find the 4-4 fit for whatever value it has here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless that shows 64 in S/H respectively, it seems eccentric|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobholl: 4@H no aces and the optimum contract in the best hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: 2@h is normal, slower road|pg||
nt|bobholl: although this migth work out better :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|frangos007:  South asking for trouble |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznq: on TGRs behalf I'd like to thank... ROLAND (for being helpful and supporting)@H@H@H... ALL COMMENTATORS (for making this event more interesting)@H@H@H Thank you all for your time ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: anyone for 2@C NV vs. voul |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 in hand is the threat but in that case Nwould have played @SK to kill the squeeze|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not me|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: now double in N ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't understand either|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract, however, is normal enough|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4NT is for the minors, which after the takeout double usually promising 4@H, shows a void in spades|pg||
nt|ugis: probably N could have bid smth over 3c..|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bobholl: and s 3@S now ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  N might double this, expecting strength from partner|pg||
nt|frangos007:  there you go :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bobholl: bid your best minor i will support you then |pg||
nt|frangos007:  this should make|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  2N, in my world, says two places to play|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: me and my partner would have done not that good on this one 1nt 2@C and than 4@H :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: may be i direct 4/5 @D would agree @S :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: yes, that would be the intention too|pg||
nt|frangos007:  going for the possible overtrick?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  trying to discard losing club if @HA is with North, perhaps|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i think the bidding makes clear the @SK is with N and he should have tackled trumps immediately|pg||
nt|frangos007:  it's all down to getting the trumps right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ugis: only diamond ruffs beat 4 spades|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|blewah: W just wanted to knoe keycards in @s excluding in @d|pg||
nt|frangos007:  this might help declarer now to make +1|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|blewah: *know|pg||
nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer should lead the @hJ next|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bobholl: bit strong for a NV 2@H isn't it ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how do you guess the singleton @D as east ??|pg||
nt|bobholl: he just tries to get the contract cheap :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  @s is a strange (to my eyes) choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: tempting to pass with those club tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt looks sound enough but on a @S lead not that good :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 2h = weak 2, 5 card suit possible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|blewah: setting up @h suit and assume captaincy with a void is usually tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: on any lead but small @D at least 1 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to go wrong here|pg||
nt|ugis: 8 tricks if they manage to ruff a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3@S a good tactical choice |pg||
nt|phil: yep|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c should be forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may opt for 2@s or 4@h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobholl: 7@D goes for only 500 :)|pg||

nt|danilo1: Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: which is why i suggested that W should give up chances of grand & settle for the practical way to reach 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: east afraid of his weak @S i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: still OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If you were going to bid 4@s, why not bid 4@c on the way?|pg||

pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Harald Skjæran and Danilo Stojanovic|pg||
nt|bobholl: so far for good tactics :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contrary to expectations, 4S failed in the other room on  19, so Montenegro lost 4 instead of gaining 9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H sort of a practical call, though once in a while you miss a slam|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 3N SHOULD BE EASY|pg||

nt|marlowepi: after failing in 4S they may well do so|pg||

nt|bobholl: same choice |pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s possible but unattractive on that suit|pg||
nt|phil: nice fit here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  on these hands you always feel good about making your contract, especially vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: in 4 spades declarer will have to guess diamonds|pg||
mb|2D|nt|danilo1: excellent by N ... he knew by the lead declarer max single @S ... to note - @SK would lead to 3NT made ... since than time for declarer to establish 3 @H tricks |pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C suffers from bad finesses|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c now|pg||
nt|zebutin: East did the disciplined thing by passing twice...i might have been tempted to bid 2@S at some point...sad to admit... :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass?????????|pg||
nt|bobholl: is that a suit ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of lost oppirtunities in this match...on  14 NS here missed a 5D slam....only to win 6 when  opps in other room didnt get beyond 3D|pg||
nt|frangos007:  aggressive double by West|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S really has nothing more to say|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mathat: 3 nt and 5 1c only|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if you pass the S  hand which is defendable|pg||
nt|phil: wouldnt occur to me to open that South trash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt occur to me to pass at these colors:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would open but with an 11-13 NT :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N would seem to be holding a textbook responsive double here|pg||
nt|ugis: might missguess now - it is more likely that N has the A of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strange lead if P couldn't bid 1 @S |pg||
nt|henryb:  a strange lead given that partner could not make a negative double |pg||
nt|andyv:  but the vul is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  this is now pushing E/W into dangerous territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  great commenters think alike|pg||
pc|h2|nt|skjaeran:  Not the worst of slams, but should stop below the 6-level.|pg||
nt|mathat: 4 @c mb|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3C was forcing|pg||
nt|ugis: and it takes some nerves for S to play small diamond twice :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|frangos007:  West far too aggressive for me|pg||
pc|hA|nt|blewah: i would have entered in the 2nd chance too, Seppo|pg||
nt|psyck: it is a good slam, should be bid both rooms|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N dicing with death|pg||
nt|bobholl: in @C only 4 :(|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|frangos007:  almost certainly one down, might be more|pg||
nt|frangos007:  difficult for declarer to guess the heart queen correctly, after this bidding|pg||

nt|marlowepi: he is betting as though his majors were  xx    Axxx|pg||

pc|c3|nt|skjaeran:  I'm told 2NT asked for aces.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt is so often superior to 5 of a minor and not only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  value of trump switch is non existent...S needed to make an attacking move|pg||
nt|ugis: so that declarer places hK with S|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: @S lead and 1 down :(|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: yes, several chances, none of which work here|pg||
nt|psyck: except @d lead :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E had no real reason to double 3S, which only gives more options to NS. on this auction W was already going to  lead a spade eevn with a void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i understand the 2H rebid by S in context, but there is something wrong when one has to rebid the same 5332 nothing hand to avoid defending. N should have bid|pg||
nt|frangos007:  now now :(|pg||
pc|d2|nt|skjaeran:  By a reliable source|pg||
nt|granguru:  so 2@c must be a relay according @h|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|frangos007:  not now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|skjaeran:  3NT asked for cuebids|pg||
nt|bobholl: will try to ruff out @H Q and than @D finesse :)|pg||
nt|ugis: sorry, 10 tricks allways :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frangos007:  he might have tested North by trying the @HJ instead|pg||
nt|frangos007:  he should have developed hearts anyway, trying to limit his spade losers|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru:  i would guess 2@d is a bal hand|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  3H=2 without Q|pg||
nt|granguru:  3n IS A NEW ASKING|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk on 5@D ... Sould shoud bid slam (or 5@S) ... already shown no slam interest before|pg||
nt|psyck: @h drop, @d fin, squeeze, all in vain|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree...and N's silence makes it difficult if not impossible for S to find the right switch|pg||
nt|ugis: thought he has a spade loser :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|bobholl: guess this is a 70% slam or so|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck:  with @hq & @cK known to be missing, N did not fancy the slam|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|zebutin: if declarer would see all cards, might just try running the @D J|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|frangos007:  heart to the 10 or J keeps your losers down|pg||
nt|frangos007:  whether it wins or loses|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frangos007:  if it wins, you come back to the ace and repeat the finesse|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|zebutin: would opponent really cover from Q9xx?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  however, no damage done as contract does seem normal enough|pg||

pc|c5|pc|sQ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dT|nt|psyck:  but on this seq, with @dQ, S could go on after 5@d|pg||

nt|frangos007:  this was risky but declarer escaped lightly|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  2@D might have made anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|bobholl: the necessaty of 3@C is not clear to me :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|psyck: which is still a good enough % to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: ew not precision ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4@S by West is makeable, but need to get the clubs right or develop clubs before diamond tricks need to be lost|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: 2@d multi & 3@h pass/correct I presume (I prefer 3@s to 3@h)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is this an upgrade to 15 - 17 or within range|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  bad spade break makes the hand not easy to handle|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might get 3NT here|pg||
nt|ugis: one of the boards where either 5 or 7 diamonds can be made :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: maybe polish club or something...?|pg||
nt|blewah: i think they did|pg||
nt|frangos007:  which always makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If its 14-16, South should surely have passed|pg||
nt|bobholl: no slam interest and don't tell opponents too much |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: N conservatism works here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  I do not agree with 3@H - should be practical - West has indicated a minimum opening hand|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i really do not understand what he is considering|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the 3NT bid is automatic, imo|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: 3@c was an overbid, S expected more with pd|pg||
nt|psyck: ya, i assumed strong @c when i saw Bd 20|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mildly astonishing 10-IMP gain for Montenegro on  20 when NS in other room did not reach 4S. S had a super hand for spades but underbid it  drastically|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess a strange upgrade|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ugis: 7 because partner denied cue bids in H and C?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: congratulations to Monaco for a solid win here|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|henryb:  Perhaps small countries have to bid aggressively :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h xfer to @s...with so many values outside of @s suit, passing 1NT is not all that bad.  But, temptation of J109xx suit too much to overcome|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||

nt|frangos007:  a routine 3NT by E/W?|pg||

mb|p|nt|frangos007:  2NT ?|pg||
nt|ugis: thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: now contemplating 4nt at this vulnarabilty ?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd act, short of @S, probably overcalling 3@H.  Partners are ready for very aggressive action with shortness  in  their suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|bobholl: he 's got 21/2 @H imo so double and than 2@H|pg||
nt|frangos007:  well, 3@C not the best bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|ugis: the second segment starts in 40 min|pg||
pc|s6|nt|zebutin: making 9 tricks it seems, when Qx in diamonds drops|pg||
nt|psyck: thx all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  looks like 3N|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|frangos007:  but the final contract is correct|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: got lucky in the lead here, there were several other better spots to play in|pg||
nt|bobholl: he will lead @C now against 5@D :)|pg||
nt|frangos007:  with diamonds breaking favourably, declarer should make, though his hand is short of entries|pg||
nt|frangos007:  but he might try winning in dummy and playing three rounds of diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: most of us would open 1D, so that if they auction goes like this we can say 3C at our third turn|pg||
nt|frangos007:  or the club finesse - either of which works|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ugis: after the magic 7d I expect a very close score after the first segment|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ugis: S is a little worried about the spade position here|pg||
nt|ugis: and of course he does not know the hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|ugis: so it will take some time to declare this one - but, as the cards lie, he can not go down|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: tya cu :) operator good job :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H lead and/or switch bloody not now :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  again, E takes the low road...the 13hcp with excellent intermediates should make 3N a favorite|pg||
