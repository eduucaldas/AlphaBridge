nt|sybarra: the more I look at I think 2 nt is minors |pg||
nt|sybarra: as point out to me should be minors,  since 1 @C did not promise clubs |pg||
nt|baldfriede: another possibility of the meaning of the pass is showing lack of @c control, but the Redouble makes that rather unlikely|pg||
nt|santyclz: The fact that the pass was alerted makes me think it was forcing.  If n doesn't bid, e must xx.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, it is the most likely explanation|pg||
nt|sybarra: the fact that we are guessing is that most pairs at this level have serveral hundred pages of system notes |pg||
nt|santyclz: "Mandatory Redoubles"  A system frequently played by weak nt players,  less  often with strong nts,.|pg||
nt|sybarra: even if we had the system cards,  we would not know where to look in the notes|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: drijver doesn't know either|pg||
nt|baldfriede: too true, Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe Bas,  having problem remembering page 336   (or what ever page it is) |pg||
