mb|1C|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
mb|d|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: seems NS use natural methods, not precision sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||

nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|cA|nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||

nt|bobholl: think any reasanoble line will let 4@S make|pg||

nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
pc|hK|pc|d2|nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||

nt|bobholl: make your choice 1 2 3 4 @H or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, white on white...a little unusual but 11 card fits can do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: this is cheaper :)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|psyck: yes, 1@h double a good idea at the vul & with passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the real criterion in such decisions is: if we do push the opps to 5H, are they likely to go down? if not, less attractoive to save, esp with 2 likely defensiove tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder how many pairs have 4@h to play in this situation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, i said that inside it:):(|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: yes...i must admit i couldn't have passed with Wests hand|pg||

mb|1H!|an|11-14 BAL|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 5@H is cheap |pg||
nt|marlowepi: not ao cheap if opps bid 6D|pg||
nt|phil: 1 looks sort of obvious to me even if you play wide ranging preempts|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H goes for 800 so better pass :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that D by N. maybe 4H is better, planning to correct spades to NT for minors|pg||
nt|phil: with a void heart, its unlikely the w/r opponents are bidding 4@h, so maybe the mild overbid of 4N is best? |pg||
nt|phil: *likely|pg||
nt|phil: I think East will get away with 5@h here if he bids it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: inside out|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  4@h looks like a better contract than 3NT.|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry even 6@H goes for only 500 :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck:  4@h could make even if you get trumps wrong|pg||
nt|bobholl: only objection against double is only 3 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like any plan that strongly emphasizes the minors, as pd is likely to have a fit. i think the double was based on the fear that S had 18 balanced and that 3N was the only game. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: narrow target to try to hit|pg||
mb|r|an|max|nt|skjaeran:  Can discard a spade on clubs.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 3@D would be forcing, ! would choose 3@D rather than jump to 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  right lead found|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@h must have shown an intermediate hand with 5@h & W was not interested in game opp less than strong @c opening values|pg||

nt|marlowepi: S has a whopper of a 1N bid. 2C worth considering as alternative|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has a nasty guess between the majors but he gambled rigth|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: if 3@D is transfer  worth 4@H ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N with good @h support and no @c stopper|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  4@s is a sensible contract, just needing the @hA onside. It isn't.|pg||
nt|bobholl: both bidding strange but 3nt is only makeable game bridge is a funny game :)|pg||
nt|frangos007:  looks like a routine -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|gmarco24: good layout for a slam, but from E's hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|blewah: thanks, Krishna|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might even go down 2|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|granguru:  thats why W is considering ..|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H positive response|pg||
nt|granguru:  probably in 1 minor|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  EW is not a regular partnership. Hope they know what they're doing now.|pg||
nt|granguru:  not known|pg||
nt|psyck:  Other room E knew pd had 4 carder @h with likely some wastage, after kickback revealed an ace missing, maybe should stop in game with min hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: 3@d may have just been a 2nd relay, G|pg||
nt|frangos007:  -1 now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|blewah: i think just relay|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mathat: after A @s play @h and finesse @c|pg||
pc|h7|nt|granguru:  4@c looks agrees trump|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  This should be 12 imps to Luxenbourg, which will essentially tie the match|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has to lead a @C in time but i guess he will |pg||
nt|henryb:  BTW, is there a website for standings?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|granguru:  4@H no @d control|pg||
nt|granguru:  only a @d lead permits to win|pg||
nt|psyck:  i've no idea what the bids mean here, but looks like they knew what they meant to do|pg||

mc|11|nt|zebutin: now little easier, but if they drive @S A down, you must feel little uneasy that @C finese isn't actually working|pg||
nt|zebutin: even if it works for the 1st time you take it that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: where|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might try to find @CJ with west|pg||

nt|blewah: slam time|pg||
nt|bobholl: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/  thanks from a kibitzer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but club toward dummy is an extra chance at no cost|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems to be the normal thing to do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should be a big pickup as EW make 4S|pg||
nt|frangos007:  another very interesting hand|pg||
nt|ugis: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psyck: NS will go down in some contract here i suppose|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless you have 2 timid rabbits sitting E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: auction might not go the same early|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: 6@H in east is the optimum contract :)|pg||
nt|blewah: both pairs play big club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3Dmaking is likely outcome|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the trick is to stay only in 4@S|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia has taken an early lead here|pg||
mb|2S!|an|weak reise|nt|psyck: luckily not possible to misguess @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW bid to 4@s, I think it's a good chance NS will go to 5@h|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chrisky: 6NT also....|pg||
nt|blewah: exclusion rkcb now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@D voidwood would be pretty now |pg||
nt|blewah: 5@d|pg||
nt|blewah: or yes 4@d, depending on their agreement|pg||
nt|bobholl: why 1 @S 3rd hand a multi or weak two looks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 1H ? why not X ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not my call but might find the 4-4 fit for whatever value it has here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless that shows 64 in S/H respectively, it seems eccentric|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobholl: 4@H no aces and the optimum contract in the best hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: 2@h is normal, slower road|pg||
nt|bobholl: although this migth work out better :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  South asking for trouble |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznq: on TGRs behalf I'd like to thank... ROLAND (for being helpful and supporting)@H@H@H... ALL COMMENTATORS (for making this event more interesting)@H@H@H Thank you all for your time ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: anyone for 2@C NV vs. voul |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 in hand is the threat but in that case Nwould have played @SK to kill the squeeze|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not me|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: now double in N ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't understand either|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract, however, is normal enough|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4NT is for the minors, which after the takeout double usually promising 4@H, shows a void in spades|pg||
nt|ugis: probably N could have bid smth over 3c..|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|bobholl: and s 3@S now ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  N might double this, expecting strength from partner|pg||
nt|frangos007:  there you go :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bobholl: bid your best minor i will support you then |pg||
nt|frangos007:  this should make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i guess he tried to deny 4@h with 3@s, dbl is maybe with 4@h|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|henryb:  2N, in my world, says two places to play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: me and my partner would have done not that good on this one 1nt 2@C and than 4@H :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||
nt|rado: probably some sort of Lebensohl situation cue= denies|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i doubt, since then 3@s would promise 4@h. weird, i don't know really|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Zipovski is well known as "i play 2 conventions partner!" when he plays with unknown partner|pg||
pc|d7|pc|sK|nt|bobholl: may be i direct 4/5 @D would agree @S :(|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, that would be the intention too|pg||
nt|frangos007:  going for the possible overtrick?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  trying to discard losing club if @HA is with North, perhaps|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i think the bidding makes clear the @SK is with N and he should have tackled trumps immediately|pg||
nt|frangos007:  it's all down to getting the trumps right|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ugis: only diamond ruffs beat 4 spades|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|blewah: W just wanted to knoe keycards in @s excluding in @d|pg||
nt|frangos007:  this might help declarer now to make +1|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|blewah: *know|pg||
nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer should lead the @hJ next|pg||
nt|frangos007:  playing @D for him|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|h2|pc|cK|pg||

nt|zebutin: would be sad to bid 6@H after 4/5@D and see partner change it to 6@S...|pg||
nt|blewah: ow, that would be sad|pg||
nt|psyck: he should have set suit with 3@h on 2@d as suggested, then had enough options|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @hs 3-2, no hard done|pg||
nt|gmarco24: also, one of the points where beginners usually go wrong - trying to ruff with long trumps|pg||
nt|rado: yes nevermind declarers or defence:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: 6@S 7@D ??|pg||
nt|rado: now danger for EW|pg||
nt|rado: if old "penalty dbl " after preempt applied|pg||
mb|d|nt|frangos007:  this will give the beleaguered Cyprus team considerable pleasure :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|ugis: pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: bit strong for a NV 2@H isn't it ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how do you guess the singleton @D as east ??|pg||
nt|bobholl: he just tries to get the contract cheap :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  @s is a strange (to my eyes) choice|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he does|pg||
mb|3H|nt|phil: tempting to pass with those club tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt looks sound enough but on a @S lead not that good :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 2h = weak 2, 5 card suit possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: setting up @h suit and assume captaincy with a void is usually tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: on any lead but small @D at least 1 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to go wrong here|pg||
nt|ugis: 8 tricks if they manage to ruff a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3@S a good tactical choice |pg||
nt|phil: yep|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c should be forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may opt for 2@s or 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 7@D goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  especially since it does not clue partner in at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Zipovski's p may be doesnt know that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: now N is in danger from his partner  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: agree|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck:  3N could be in trouble with the @c break|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: which is why i suggested that W should give up chances of grand & settle for the practical way to reach 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: east afraid of his weak @S i guess|pg||
pc|d3|nt|phil: still OK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  If you were going to bid 4@s, why not bid 4@c on the way?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  both sides have done well to control the bidding|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Harald Skjæran and Danilo Stojanovic|pg||
nt|bobholl: so far for good tactics :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contrary to expectations, 4S failed in the other room on  19, so Montenegro lost 4 instead of gaining 9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H sort of a practical call, though once in a while you miss a slam|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Dessy, he might say some things after this board, try to inform us :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: very good @D Q keeps communication and not a ruff yet :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: he already did it|pg||
nt|gmarco24: oh boy  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: dbl was penn..|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: but very calm|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: and to CK|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck:  e.g. a @s lead duck all around would probably beat 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 100 better than -180 but 140 is better|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bobholl: it worked in the end :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, practical bid is a good one if you haven't discussed science with p|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: after 2@d-3@h-3@s cue- he still has option of exclusion key card ask of 5@d|pg||
pc|h9|nt|frangos007:  3@H not the easiest of contracts - this will need to be played well|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|frangos007:  but cards are kindly placed for declarer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|skjaeran:  Nice defence by north|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|skjaeran:  Established communications to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: even if S did not want to bid 2@h on 1@h other table (in case it showed better hand?) he should have bid it on 1@S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|zebutin: yes i think on previous deal you easily can find 7 if you have that in cards, if you start with 3@H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|frangos007:  W might have tried to get her ruff|pg||
nt|frangos007:  in spades, but perhaps she expects to make her @SQ anyway|pg||
nt|frangos007:  declarer now worried about repeated club forces|pg||
nt|frangos007:  so not easy to draw last trump|pg||
nt|frangos007:  he might easily lose complete control and end up several down|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gmarco24: a few evenings ago he said to him:"if you are not sure, keep the bidding alive. first rule!"|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, i guess, Koldzic is just sticking to the first rule|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: Rumen was surpriced on 3@H bid :)|pg||
nt|rado: we are happy they missed to discussed what dbl was, but next Opponents wil not have that chance:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ugis: E should have signalled the spade A, looks like he did not. Far from the best defence by E - diamond ruff also rather obvious|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psyck:  Declarer just hoping for @s44 or some such fav lie of cards|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@h here is pretty normal, i think but i don't know about W's pass|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: Not sure what the redouble shows for them here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  well, it was a very small chance anyway, but the correct play would have been to play the @SK and hope to pin the Q|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobholl: system with 2@D as multi or MF could reach 6@H in east |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|blewah: i usually play wide range of overcall|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d2|nt|frangos007:  because even if the @SA was singleton, he would still lose two spades|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: why not J@H ?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|zebutin: declarer must have misscounted something|pg||
nt|bobholl: good reason :)|pg||
nt|frangos007:  Cyprus defending very well here, regretting not doubling this i am sure :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: seeing 52 cards is always easier :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N SHOULD BE EASY|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another possible pickup for montenegro, if they can bid and make 6H in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after failing in 4S they may well do so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frangos007:  a tricky hand with points fairly evenly distributed and no strong distributions|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobholl: poor n has to find a bid |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 nt would be my choice|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N perhaps?|pg||
nt|bobholl: same choice |pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s possible but unattractive on that suit|pg||
nt|phil: nice fit here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  on these hands you always feel good about making your contract, especially vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: in 4 spades declarer will have to guess diamonds|pg||
mb|2C|nt|danilo1: excellent by N ... he knew by the lead declarer max single @S ... to note - @SK would lead to 3NT made ... since than time for declarer to establish 3 @H tricks |pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C suffers from bad finesses|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c now|pg||
nt|zebutin: East did the disciplined thing by passing twice...i might have been tempted to bid 2@S at some point...sad to admit... :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass?????????|pg||
nt|bobholl: is that a suit ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of lost oppirtunities in this match...on  14 NS here missed a 5D slam....only to win 6 when  opps in other room didnt get beyond 3D|pg||
nt|frangos007:  aggressive double by West|pg||
mb|d!|nt|andyv:  S really has nothing more to say|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mathat: 3 nt and 5 1c only|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if you pass the S  hand which is defendable|pg||
nt|phil: wouldnt occur to me to open that South trash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt occur to me to pass at these colors:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would open but with an 11-13 NT :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N would seem to be holding a textbook responsive double here|pg||
nt|ugis: might missguess now - it is more likely that N has the A of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strange lead if P couldn't bid 1 @S |pg||
nt|henryb:  a strange lead given that partner could not make a negative double |pg||
nt|andyv:  but the vul is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  this is now pushing E/W into dangerous territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  great commenters think alike|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: they discuss that .. Rumen will not pass 2@Sx - will bid 2nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: he has 17hcp|pg||
pc|dK|nt|skjaeran:  Not the worst of slams, but should stop below the 6-level.|pg||
nt|mathat: 4 @c mb|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3C was forcing|pg||
nt|ugis: and it takes some nerves for S to play small diamond twice :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frangos007:  West far too aggressive for me|pg||
nt|rado: DBL of 2@C could be misleading here since he has another good suit  suppose partner had only Kxxx(x) in @H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blewah: i would have entered in the 2nd chance too, Seppo|pg||
nt|psyck: it is a good slam, should be bid both rooms|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N dicing with death|pg||
nt|bobholl: in @C only 4 :(|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|frangos007:  almost certainly one down, might be more|pg||
nt|frangos007:  difficult for declarer to guess the heart queen correctly, after this bidding|pg||
nt|rado: this time N has natural lead @D:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobholl: 2 entries to the @D now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is betting as though his majors were  xx    Axxx|pg||
pc|cK|nt|frangos007:  but might get the trumps right|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck:  good slam in fact, need little more than one of the fin working |pg||
nt|bobholl: should yes but will ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: again N refuses to bid 3N|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mathat: to pass|pg||
nt|ugis: N should play A and 10, not K|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|phil: I thought South was endplayed into it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|skjaeran:  I'm told 2NT asked for aces.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt is so often superior to 5 of a minor and not only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  value of trump switch is non existent...S needed to make an attacking move|pg||
nt|ugis: so that declarer places hK with S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobholl: @S lead and 1 down :(|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: yes, several chances, none of which work here|pg||
nt|psyck: except @d lead :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E had no real reason to double 3S, which only gives more options to NS. on this auction W was already going to  lead a spade eevn with a void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i understand the 2H rebid by S in context, but there is something wrong when one has to rebid the same 5332 nothing hand to avoid defending. N should have bid|pg||
nt|frangos007:  now now :(|pg||
pc|cT|nt|skjaeran:  By a reliable source|pg||
nt|granguru:  so 2@c must be a relay according @h|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|frangos007:  not now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|skjaeran:  3NT asked for cuebids|pg||
nt|bobholl: will try to ruff out @H Q and than @D finesse :)|pg||
nt|ugis: sorry, 10 tricks allways :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frangos007:  he might have tested North by trying the @HJ instead|pg||
nt|frangos007:  he should have developed hearts anyway, trying to limit his spade losers|pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru:  i would guess 2@d is a bal hand|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  3H=2 without Q|pg||
nt|granguru:  3n IS A NEW ASKING|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk on 5@D ... Sould shoud bid slam (or 5@S) ... already shown no slam interest before|pg||
nt|psyck: @h drop, @d fin, squeeze, all in vain|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree...and N's silence makes it difficult if not impossible for S to find the right switch|pg||
nt|ugis: thought he has a spade loser :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|bobholl: guess this is a 70% slam or so|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck:  with @hq & @cK known to be missing, N did not fancy the slam|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|zebutin: if declarer would see all cards, might just try running the @D J|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|frangos007:  heart to the 10 or J keeps your losers down|pg||
nt|frangos007:  whether it wins or loses|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gmarco24: x@c maybe|pg||
pc|c3|nt|frangos007:  if it wins, you come back to the ace and repeat the finesse|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|nt|zebutin: would opponent really cover from Q9xx?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  however, no damage done as contract does seem normal enough|pg||
pc|d8|nt|zebutin: but ofc that is impossible line in real life, giving 0% chance instead of some good real chances|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry somewhat less |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sT|nt|psyck:  but on this seq, with @dQ, S could go on after 5@d|pg||
nt|frangos007:  diamond to force the last trump would have been best, claim now|pg||

nt|frangos007:  this was risky but declarer escaped lightly|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  2@D might have made anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|gmarco24: good defence, they understand each other|pg||
nt|rado: here some auction expected|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|bobholl: the necessaty of 3@C is not clear to me :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rado: 2@C precision style|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: which is still a good enough % to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: ew not precision ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4@S by West is makeable, but need to get the clubs right or develop clubs before diamond tricks need to be lost|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: 2@d multi & 3@h pass/correct I presume (I prefer 3@s to 3@h)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is this an upgrade to 15 - 17 or within range|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  bad spade break makes the hand not easy to handle|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might get 3NT here|pg||
nt|ugis: one of the boards where either 5 or 7 diamonds can be made :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: maybe polish club or something...?|pg||
nt|blewah: i think they did|pg||
nt|frangos007:  which always makes|pg||
nt|rado: and 11-14 p |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If its 14-16, South should surely have passed|pg||
nt|bobholl: no slam interest and don't tell opponents too much |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: N conservatism works here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  I do not agree with 3@H - should be practical - West has indicated a minimum opening hand|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i really do not understand what he is considering|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the 3NT bid is automatic, imo|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck: 3@c was an overbid, S expected more with pd|pg||
nt|psyck: ya, i assumed strong @c when i saw Bd 20|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mildly astonishing 10-IMP gain for Montenegro on  20 when NS in other room did not reach 4S. S had a super hand for spades but underbid it  drastically|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess a strange upgrade|pg||
nt|rado: down 2 wil not be good for EW with easy 3NT|pg||
nt|gmarco24: let's see if there is -3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ugis: 7 because partner denied cue bids in H and C?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|frangos007:  ah well :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|frangos007:  perhaps he likes to make his partner work for it :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|othered1: Interestingly the auction duplicates that of the OR|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rado: declarer has easy plan 2Aces + 4 trumps I think|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: they should end in w and play @D otherewise made|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rado: trump to 8@H in dummy|pg||
nt|rado: trumps for sure 4-0|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: congratulations to Monaco for a solid win here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|henryb:  Perhaps small countries have to bid aggressively :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h xfer to @s...with so many values outside of @s suit, passing 1NT is not all that bad.  But, temptation of J109xx suit too much to overcome|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frangos007:  a heart lead by S beats 3NT I am told - and perhaps I have overlooked this :)|pg||

nt|ugis: thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: now contemplating 4nt at this vulnarabilty ?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd act, short of @S, probably overcalling 3@H.  Partners are ready for very aggressive action with shortness  in  their suit|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bobholl: he 's got 21/2 @H imo so double and than 2@H|pg||
nt|frangos007:  well, 3@C not the best bid in my opinion|pg||

mb|3N|nt|zebutin: making 9 tricks it seems, when Qx in diamonds drops|pg||
nt|psyck: thx all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  but the final contract is correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: got lucky in the lead here, there were several other better spots to play in|pg||
nt|bobholl: he will lead @C now against 5@D :)|pg||
nt|frangos007:  with diamonds breaking favourably, declarer should make, though his hand is short of entries|pg||
nt|frangos007:  but he might try winning in dummy and playing three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: cheers than|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: most of us would open 1D, so that if they auction goes like this we can say 3C at our third turn|pg||
nt|frangos007:  or the club finesse - either of which works|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: then|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ugis: after the magic 7d I expect a very close score after the first segment|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ugis: S is a little worried about the spade position here|pg||
nt|ugis: and of course he does not know the hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|ugis: so it will take some time to declare this one - but, as the cards lie, he can not go down|pg||
nt|gmarco24: cheers|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|bobholl: on a @H lead and/or switch bloody not now :)|pg||
