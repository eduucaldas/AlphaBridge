nt|josj: round 3, the evening session, starts at 19.00 WIB in about 90 mins. from now|pg||
nt|andyv:  final board of this set.  Thank you everyone for joining us|pg||
nt|santyclz: You can if you take the @d finesse early and w shifts to a @s.  Then they only need 3 @hs.|pg||
mb|2H!|an|H + m|mb|2S|nt|thesai:  flanery must be:)|pg||
nt|thesai:  2@h|pg||
nt|josj: Yogyakarta can go down in glory when they reach the grand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: needs just @C 3-2 |pg||
nt|josj: (or 10/J blank in W)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: in CR, a heart loser went away when N led the @C8 and declarer ruffed out the @CK|pg||
nt|josj: a @D lead will be more challenging|pg||
nt|josj: this is the last board of the match and also of the day|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  board 14, the ending was a bit strange so I'm not sure that the result shown is the correct one.  It's unlikely with 3 cards left that E would lead a @c into the S hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|josj: congrats to Jakarta on reaching the finals and ty all for watching|pg||
