nt|penseur9: hi Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: welcome back for the start of round 3|pg||

nt|penseur9: hi Jack :)|pg||
nt|joest: hello Andre|pg||
nt|penseur9: welcome back for th last segment of 12 boards|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 5@D|pg||
nt|joest: and maybe there is something to be said for bidding 5@d right now depending on how many diamonds partner promises|pg||
nt|ady: spade finesse onside  would have small slam|pg||
nt|offthebend:  |pg||
nt|ady: take-out double mean spade finesse odds against|pg||
nt|joest: don't know what West's system options might be but he has to be worried about the openings getting to 4@h I would think|pg||
nt|joest: opponents getting to 4@h|pg||
mb|4C|nt|joest: 2NT often used as a four card limit raise (or better) and that looks to be true here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|joest: assuming 4@c is fit-showing that hasnot improved east's view of the world|pg||
nt|joest: in practice 6 rates to make b/c of the difficult guess on opening lead|pg||
nt|ady: it is possible to make 12 tricks in diamonds ruffing club king down and taking a ruffing finesse in hearts|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|penseur9: EW shown in 4th and NS in 6th after 2 round...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: trump leads is best but that's far from clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW seem to play pretty standard Polish Club; 1@c=11-14 bal, 15-18 nat or 19+ any|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c nat, 2@d=wk 2M, 2M two-suited|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2N both minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: watch out for Polsih carding: lead low from a doubleton. Virtually compulsory in Poland, like having to have four trumps to raise in France |pg||
nt|joest: yeah I think you're right|pg||
nt|joest: five certainly will pose no difficulties|pg||

nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|joest: West was VERY conservative in closed room, missing a spade game|pg||
nt|joest: wow anaother slam|pg||
nt|ady: apparantly closed room in 6@D|pg||
nt|penseur9: they kept all the slams for desert :)|pg||
nt|joest: on ace and a diamond (best) declarer needs to take care to win the king in dummy, then ruff out clubs|pg||

mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|ady: 6@H on for n/s   but 6@S a good save|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|mdgraham: 1NT=clubs|pg||

nt|mdgraham: my word, what a result from the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  It takes a trump lead to stop 5@s.|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: double game swing|pg||
nt|joest: and in the other room, a heart lead might have put 5@d down 2 doubled|pg||
nt|joest: this looks to be 'win 15'|pg||
nt|penseur9: what's the best lead here?|pg||
nt|joest: Mike or Andre do you know what 2@d meant?|pg||
nt|penseur9: no clue sorry|pg||
nt|joest: multi is inconsistent with north's response|pg||
nt|joest: 3@s in most structures says 'correct to 4@h if that is your suit"|pg||
nt|joest: maybe they play a different one|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm guessing that 2@d was a "transfer weak 2" and 3@s was natural and invitational|pg||
nt|penseur9: a Multi would show one major... no the case here|pg||
nt|joest: is east really thinking over his opening lead this long?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, no idea....sorry. I have an EW CC, but not NS|pg||

pc|d3|nt|joest: ok that makes sense.  Thanks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|joest: from east's perspective if he wants to play for four hearts (+ 2 clubs + 2 diamonds + 1 spade) he must start on the suit right now|pg||

nt|joest: east with a somewhat aggressive takeout double|pg||
nt|joest: and it's primary effect on this hand may well be to permit north to guess spades right in 4@h|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2NT by south?|pg||
nt|joest: that seems like a good value bid|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: 4@c must have been a cue for spades - Soth's hand is very strong for spades |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: that could work.  and partner will pass with 12 or 13 and you miss a game|pg||

nt|ady: hand 14  where 4@S was made e/w and 6@H on for n/s   4 spades should not have made   but even down 1 would have been a poor result for n/s|pg||
nt|joest: i agree on all counts Edwin|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|joest: declarer has shown the spade k,the hearts ace, and presumably the club ace|pg||
nt|joest: sorry David|pg||
nt|joest: so did declarer start with Kxxx/Axxx/x/AQxx or Kxxx/Axxx/Qx/Axx|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: i'm told declarer could have two clubs and 3 diamodns in which case Kxxx/Axxx/Qxx/Ax and Kxxx/Axxx/xx/AQx are 2 more possibilities!|pg||
nt|joest: what is south going to pitch on this btw?|pg||
nt|ady: has to be a club to have a chance of making|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east will open  either 1@C  or 1@S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|ady: n/s  have 4@H  and should get there|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|joest: that seems increasingly common: not that that makes it right|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: to double or to pass?|pg||
nt|joest: to double|pg||
nt|penseur9: no :)|pg||
nt|joest: pass has been the standard move most of the time :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, some people do, and it's mildly annoying that they seem to get away with it |pg||
nt|joest: that's why they keep doing it! :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|joest: they manage to find eight card fits with surprising frequency|pg||
nt|joest: not so surprising to them|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes with @S finesse they are home|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S does not look bad   but with clubs 4-1   at least 500   so not that much of a save|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: in fact it was 500 in 4@S closed room  so leaders will gain a few here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|joest: admittedly this is pretty filthy 12 count but many do double 1@c on 4333 patterns with the whole one level open to them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. Maybe there's something in it, but it's not my personal style - it's just something you have to decide for yourself|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: general mis fit  especially n/s|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: the funny thing is that East is quite good enough to find @SQ even without that extravagant @D10 |pg||
nt|penseur9: not the players... the cards :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: and if you have low standards for overcalls west could have popped in with 1@s and headed this all off at the pass :)|pg||
nt|ady: way over the top now    surely double from north penalty?|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|ady: it seems the opening shows 5  and a minor suit|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|joest: 3NT might seem like a big bid but: (a) he is vulnerable (b) he has a good five card suit; (c) these hands play great when the NT bidder sits over pretty much all the known high ...|pg||
nt|joest: cards|pg||
nt|joest: of course this stretches those principles to the limit :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: best defence is for @HA and a diamond switch (ducked by East), but that may not be too easy to find|pg||
nt|joest: an opening diamond lead would have forced declarer to be pretty much double dummy|pg||
nt|joest: but East put his faith in his partner, which is generally a good thing|pg||
nt|ady: when opps walk into  trouble  surely there is a way of getting a penalty|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: North should conceal the @h3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: North would surely be able to guess the 2 suits|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: apparantly 2@H shows hearts and 1 other  which could be spades|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: or East could take @dQ and lead small back  |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|joest: that is that|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joest: with a diamond switch, I think it was always going to come down to north guessing the spade queen: diffcult|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still scope for defensive error|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West needs to go up with the @HA|pg||
nt|joest: east could returnsomething else and pitch an encouraging diamond the last club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, that would do|pg||
nt|joest: of course declarer is squeezing himself on the clubs so he may well play hearts himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite fraught defending these types of contract - you know if you go wrong it's a likely game swing out |pg||
nt|penseur9: on a @C finesse I beleive can make 3nt (I'm a born optimist) :)|pg||
nt|joest: the heart position might have been a bit clearer if west had ducked the opening lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read the CC right, @s7 shows no spade interest|pg||
nt|joest: but the highspade spot would seem to suggest the layout is at it seems|pg||
