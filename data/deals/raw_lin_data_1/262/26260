nt|Vugraphzfv: chip's note says 2NT would be takeout.  looks like X is just cards|pg||
nt|kareno: East should preserve his queen of trumps for a possible overruff.|pg||
nt|passell: same old story there are old knights and bold knights but very few old bold knights|pg||
nt|kareno: Right, Mike.  NV I might consider north's action but doubled, down one is a probable loss.  |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: drijver twirls hte last trick, leans over dummy.  zia mutters something I can't pick up|pg||
nt|kareno: It's true - it's only half a board lost vs. how many IMPs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: handling @s6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|passell: interesting at bam balancing here is more likely when opponents are nvul  because if they are vul they go down 200 on a lot of hands you make 2 of a major|pg||
