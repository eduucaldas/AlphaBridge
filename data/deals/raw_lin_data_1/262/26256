nt|HedyG:  3@c shows a constructive hand (if they play lebensohl) showing 8+|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: beatty sat up straight when 3@c came through, had a long think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: rosters for all qualifiers are in the daily bulletin via www.acbl.org/nabc|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfv: jacobs: "that's a good trump suit"|pg||
nt|HedyG:  so Beatty decided opposite a passed hand partner|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: NS are team Kolesnik, EW are team Doub|pg||
nt|queequeg: hi all :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jacobs played @H7 before jackson had played|pg||
nt|queequeg: Fulvio Fantoni's website is updated with news and photos from San Francisco: http://www.fulviofantoni.com/en/reisinger-san-francisco-2012.html|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jacobs shows me a note saying 3@C not invitational|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: beatty's note says 3@C denies 9+ HCP.  some kind of reverse lebensohl situation|pg||
pc|c4|nt|HedyG:  that is interesting|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kareno: Hi from not so rainy San Francisco :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: BAM scoring essentially  matchpoints -- but only 2 tables used in the comparison|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  win = 1  lose = 0  tie = 0.5 or 1/2  depending on which version of BBO you're using|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: 3 board rounds -- players will change every round  so the "running total" shown on bbo will be meaningless|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|nt|kareno: Kolesnik expected only one heart in dummy after the raise.  Good tactical move by Wildafsky |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: NS: Doub starts in 4th with 0.97 carryover  EW: Kolesnick 7th with 0.49|pg||

pc|cA|pc|d2|pc|c8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leaders Zimmermann with 4.25    10th place  0.00|pg||

nt|warrens:  hi all|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: (few will need that)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: and that was their primary goal :)|pg||

pc|c6|pc|d9|nt|nilsland:  hi warren :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|warrens:  he didn't really throw a @D, did he?|pg||
nt|kareno: This is one of those great days of bridge - toughest event on the schedule and in the hunt no matter where you started the day|pg||
mc|11|nt|Vugraphzfc: he did.  "I mispitched"he said|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last time i watched a table with Peter Rank playing -- he and Barry Crane had a 463 on 325 avg to blow away the field|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: jackson slow to pull the tray through the curtain, sher pushes it further and has a laugh|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Berkowitz would for sure bid the @Hs|pg||
nt|HedyG:  Jacobs plays Gazzilli, either nat 11-15 or and 16+|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jacobs generously showing me all his explanations after showing them to jackson|pg||
mb|2S|an|less than 8 HCP|mb|p|nt|HedyG:  thats great! the players so rarely do that|pg||
nt|HedyG:  2@s denies as much as 8 hcps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: sher mumbling whether jacobs could have 16+ to pass 2@S, beatty says he could|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|HedyG:  cant get tapped out, can always get to dummy in @H for the @s finesse|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||

nt|warrens:  Wildavsky must have been trying to convince declarer to take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|kareno: Pretty well dropping a board.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: BAM scoring  difference of 10 same win as difference of 4000|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW missed out on the heart fit here|pg||
nt|kareno: Game makes in either major but when east doesn't mention hearts, west cannot bid on|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|warrens:  missed a pretty laydown 4@H's here.  East might have bid 2@H, planning to raise a 2@S rebid to 3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|kareno: He'll have to take a first-round spade finesse because he has only one entry|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|kareno: I would be torn but bid 2@h because it is the hearts that make the 3@s bid feasible.  |pg||
nt|kareno: Especially since partner didn't raise spades - could have even a singleton spade and heart length|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: Now the defense must play a heart to force the spade finesse without a test lead (not that it makes a difference as the queen is onside third.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Jacobs rebid Gazzilli 2@C|pg||
nt|nilsland:  with KQJxxx/Axxx/Jx/x you may rebid 2S to avoid a bad 4-3 contract but this hand is stronger and you hope for a game|pg||
mc|10|nt|kareno: Gazilli helps with hands like this|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Gazzili works|pg||
pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: somewhat. "already pushed to bid gazilli, didn't want to push more, perhaps I should have"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jacobs: "sorry"|pg||
nt|HedyG:  right, upset|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|HedyG:  3 board rounds?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  yes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|HedyG:  John how is 5@c= vs 3@c +1 only 1 imp?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: board-a-match not IMP|pg||
nt|HedyG:  ohhhhhhhh sure, sry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: some tables finished, players wandering silently|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla:  would prefer better fourth spade|pg||
nt|HedyG:  Jacobs overcall includes his pd's shortness in @H|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: sher shakes his head when the tray comes back through|pg||
nt|HedyG:  Sher thinks its Xmas early|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: in BAM only matters if you win or lose the board not by how much|pg||
nt|HedyG:  right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: so worth taking chances for overtricks/additional undertricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|HedyG:  does 10 count towards 1 point?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: yesterday duboin took a finesse to go down three in 3NT instead of taking A to make it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfv: even 110 vs 100 is enough to win the board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jacobs asks for sher's system card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jackson writing a note|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|HedyG:  so 3@H -1 in the other room mean if he makes 2@s he wins the board (110)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sher leans over dummy and shakes his head again|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Barry Crane: "God deals you A-K so you don't have a lead problem."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: clock on 02, voices start filtering in|pg||

nt|reisig: BAM at it's best!|pg||
nt|HedyG:  indeed!|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Sher took a deep position by never showing values _ didn't work here|pg||

mb|p|nt|nilsland:  french isnt easy...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen all permutations of spelling -- not sure which is official|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kareno: But I speak French pretty well, just can't spell it well.  Learned by speaking|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: on  2  Jacobs stops in 2@S after Gazzilli sequence  |pg||
nt|kareno: So a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|warrens:  I guess that means that Gazzili doesn't always work :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Now double by south will be penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe best on that hand -- transfer rebids over 1N :)|pg||
nt|kareno: North could make a very light takeout double |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|warrens:  It would be very light imho|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|nt|warrens:  oops|pg||
nt|kareno: That is a penalty double!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Wouldn't you agree, panelists?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  yes, has to be.  how could you have a takeout X of 2@S but not have a negative X of 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would be scramble -- DBL must be penalty|pg||
nt|nilsland:  for sure|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kareno: Board 1 was a win for e/w and is scored correctly for BAM|pg||
pc|s3|nt|warrens:  3 @C's and 5@S's through ruffs (especially on a @D lead)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|kareno: spade lead automatic on the auction I think.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  2  operator showing line where 2@S only making 3|pg||
nt|nilsland:   2 was only 9 tricks (no spade finess)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|warrens:  very strange not taking the finesse|pg||

nt|warrens:  -1, even X'ed, is not bad here|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: next round  Auken (6th)  vs Fleisher (4th)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 8 minutes left on the clock|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry that comment was about  2 at other table :)|pg||
nt|kareno: At BAM you must try not to let a board go out of reach.  Always try to cover a possible -100 by teammates also.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Joe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we have a few moments -- i must apologize to anyone who watched last night|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i mistakenly referred to good 1st set scores but they were from Day 1 rather than SemiFinal 1 -- mea culpa|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3 other room in 2@S    Sher never bid with South hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Peter Rank just commented that this is his first Reisinger since 1977!!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  about time then :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that set i watched Rank-Crane was 1975|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: next Auken vs Fleisher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Auken is one of 2 Finalists with only 4 players|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other is Hans  [sartaj hans - peter gill   tom hanlon - mike moss]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Auken  lineup   auken-welland   bramley-stansby|pg||
nt|nilsland:  what pair in this room?|pg||
nt|kareno: I chatted with Peter the first day of the tournament and he looked great.  He was playing in the BAM also, the two-day one, as was I (my only event this time)|pg||

nt|kareno: Too long IMO|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  playing a version of Precision|pg||

nt|warrens:  well, he does have 16, but a pretty minimal 16 |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 4+@H, forcing 1 round|pg||
nt|kareno: I wouldn't choose a forcing club frankly|pg||
nt|kareno: @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|warrens:  1@H was forcing, but 2@D is not.  West could pass, bid 2@H or 2@S.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i believe Bramley could be 4@H 5+@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: He didn't have enough for a 1@s response?  How much does that need?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nilsland:  EW in 4@S as other table|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is where Precision can get you in trouble.  No, 1@S is game forcing.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kareno: They'll survive if they make 21d, and their teammates don't compress their spade tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this may be the one and only time you see world class players choose 2@D [7-card fit] instead of 9-card @S fit|pg||
nt|nilsland:  The nice thing about BAM - it does not matter HOW you win the board|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4@S-1|pg||
nt|warrens:  all we need now is a low @C to the King so North can get 2 @H pitches for a @H ruff.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Welland-Auken did not compress their defensive trump tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't see how that's possible|pg||
nt|nilsland:  would be a nice push warren :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  but also -1 if Stansby ducks this|pg||
