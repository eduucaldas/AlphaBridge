mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kit: East was close to a double|pg||
nt|kit: Now West will probably fly in with 5@H|pg||
nt|kit: Selling out is just bad odds -- too likely that either 4@S or 5@H (or both) will make.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|dalejo:  Agree, but S will have tough choice after 5@H-P-P.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Good bid -- and should end the auction I think.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I think South has to sell out.  He doesn't expect to make 5@S, not clear he can make 4@S, and he has no idea if 5@H will make.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|dalejo:  Probably so, 5@S too likely to go down 2.  As it does.|pg||
nt|kit: This could be a tricky hand to play.  Declarer needs the long club in dummy to get 6 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 spade, and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|kit: Which means he can't draw trumps -- he mus watch his entries|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|kit: Well done -- now should make easily|pg||
nt|kit: Best defense is small diamond back, but declarer can still bring in the club suit.|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth can pretty much work out the entire hand from the line of play and bidding.|pg||

nt|kit: Hand now cold assuming declarer plays a club before the third trump, which he surely will do.|pg||
nt|dalejo:  yes.  He is thinking about what to do after N follows small on the club.  Could speed things up by leading it first.|pg||
nt|kit: he may be wondering whether or not to draw a 2nd round of trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: now ruff a club high, draw trumps ending in dummy, and 2 good clubs get up to 11 tricks.|pg||
