nt|KiwiBridge: we didn't really beleive our auction on this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nice for them to leave us a grand slam for last.  too bad it's academic|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|5+ not GF|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|11-13 BAL|nt|gracelin: yes, but we can still enojoy sme good bidding to the laydown grand slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is possible that 2@C is just 1-round force|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = BAL, 11-13|pg||
nt|gracelin: 7D could be right in some layouts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: For instance, West has 3-3-4-3 and same high cads.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe starting point for the EW system was the same system we now see for Bates-Wold-Compton   originally Bramley-Wold-Passell|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = FG, presume 4@D & 5+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's as far as my very old notes goes|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that feels grammatically wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: still more information than I have at the moment.  likely to get explanations before the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: bruno makes eye contact with me, smiles, sighs.  exhausting event playing 4-handed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: clock says 27.  bramley may find a bid by then.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if playing Exclusion RKC -- Bramley hasn't established @C as trump|pg||
nt|gracelin: does Bramley really believe the ourcome of the match is depending on his decision here ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: can't tell if he does or if he is just a perfectionist|pg||
nt|gracelin: outcome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bart keeps plugging   ALWAYS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sitting behind his shoulder, can't see his eyes, just assess his body language|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Vugraphzfv: which is largely consistent regardless of situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: If he is just to bid 4Cm I can make that bid minutes agao.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously  might be easier auction if west did NOT open|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: perhaps our auction was better after all :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: bramley: "we're in a game force"|pg||
nt|gracelin: The play will be fast though.|pg||
