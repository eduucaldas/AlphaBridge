mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: At the five-level, best to play the better fit.  I assume 5@s went down with a diamond ruff|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: if 5@C identified shortness  then Robinson-Boyd probably get DBL in 5@H|pg||

nt|kareno: In the OR are Meckstroth/Hamman n/s and if they are playing Meckwell's Precision then the north hand might be too heavy to pass the invittation|pg||
nt|smoller:  2-way check-back is called XY NT here, and XYZ is an extension|pg||
