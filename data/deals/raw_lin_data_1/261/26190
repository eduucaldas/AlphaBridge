mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S or 4@S -- but specs in other room were screaming for RDBL|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: were Bramley/Stewart planning something else after a 2@D rebid??|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: RDBL would be very strange   ostensibly saying can penalize at least 2 suits|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i see 2 lines -- one goes down quickly  the other goes down slowly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which will he choose?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I disagree strongly|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d5|nt|kareno: Most pairs these days seem to play (I don't, I reiterate) that when you've bid game at adverse that creates a five-level force.|pg||
