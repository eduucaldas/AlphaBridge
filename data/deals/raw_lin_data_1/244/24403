nt|malipivo:  So we are watching one of those major battles.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Brief information about the format:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the Girls series, the qualifier will be played as a double round robin of 16-board matches, producing the top four teams. The knockout stage consists of the semifinals and the final and playoff for third place. There is no Bye round.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 4: a push.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a non-slam deal on this one.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Partscore battle is upon us.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We can see it easily (not even 3!n), as E-W are holding diamonds and N-S hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  To be exact: major versus minor suits battle.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nauczone dowiadczeni Amerykanki w 4 zatrzyma³y siê w 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Slam zone!|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  7@c, perhaps, let's see!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We might be happy with risky 6@d.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  it will be hard to beat 800 points from the Open Room|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Nice defense by the French girls.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|malipivo:  And now we know all the crucial information about HCP.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So spade finesse is almost certain thing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing 2@s, so a great opportunity to get imps for Poland.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As we can see, spades are 2-2, so third diamond is going away on ruffing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If you are writing a textbook about pretty deals, this is one of them.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East-West cannot take their chances in diamonds, it would be costly.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I almost feel the fear of bidding it, but it is understandable.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If Polish girls are thinking of medal, they have to take some risk.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am afraid of some time penalties.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the meantime, welcome to all newcomers, we are watching Girls, second round of round robin:|pg||

nt|malipivo:  !n is right sided (see the spades).|pg||

nt|malipivo:  But watch the clubs!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  low to @cK, spades and @cA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2!nX is not going to be played, let's 3@d E-W|pg||
nt|malipivo:  1-2 spade losers, a heart and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@dX would be -1 for 200 and an imp to Poland.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Would we double 3@d, so it might be -1 for 100 and 2 imps to Netherlands!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Wow!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And double heart finesse is on, so it might even make.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hawaii in trumps is not nice for the declarer, to be honest.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Another battle is ahead of us. We have got a nice Dealer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The defense must be tough if they dislike 4@s N-S.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The Jengs reinvent the Rule of 20 :)|pg||
nt|johnjones:  North should ignore the 4 card Spade suit and transfer to D.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Did I say my morning praying, didn't I?|pg||
nt|kania12: w 5 dla odmiany Natalia majac ladniejsze karty niz Danuta w poprzednim spasowala|pg||
mb|2D|nt|coolbeans:  In my opinion, 4S should show a 3S or 3NT response to 2NT without the interference, while a pass should show a 4S response|pg||

nt|joecritter:  I joke that I take credit for creating the Soukup Berk monster. Berk's father was competing in the GNT's so I got to teach him the last part of 2/1 he needed. A day later he played with Soukup, slaughtering me and his father in the process|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: PM me your suggestions, if I like it i'll post it!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, it would work perfectly.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Gotten a suggestion for a blast off to 6@S, thats possible, if there is a killing lead, harder for them to find.|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: Right we of course know there isn't one, but they don't|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, even diamonds behave.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: E has not enough for 6@d, so he should bid 4nt|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: now 5@c from W|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The agressive 1S overcall by Isha is not really her style, but is on target on this hand.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  It will get Taylor off to the best lead of a S versus a NT contract.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I think she's becoming a little more aggressive to compensate|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h shall go down.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|malipivo:  even two if hearts are misguessed|pg||
pc|s9|nt|coolbeans:  W goes to game after E makes a non-forcing 3S bid after W has already described his hand. Gotta love IMPs|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  Well, grand was risky, I admit that.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 6@S especially ideal given the score at the other table|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As long as South is having 3+ clubs it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Nothing more embarrassing than bieng in 7 down 1 when the other table is not even in 6|pg||
nt|joecritter:  A second lie to make up for the first one?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Two wrongs make a right :)?|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Or even with two clubs in South's hand it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I think the best line is K@C then A@C, when all follow to 3 rounds, he'll know that N is 0733 and will know exactly what to do.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, very right you are.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: if S ruffs the A@C, then N was 0715, that would not be a 3@H call |pg||
nt|MolvaM: well bid laydown slam with only 23 hcp|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 14.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: can declarer find the club play?|pg||

nt|malipivo:  :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!nS in the Open Room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|MolvaM: last 2 hands, the defence slipped in the last few tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: and a low club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  and a club attack from East|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarers could have gone down but the defence let the contracts thru|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  What a hand|pg||
nt|joecritter:  South passed this at the other table. I think Hakan just broke his partner's heart|pg||
nt|johnjones:  It looks like we are having technical problems again|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, it was very unpleasant other room too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridgegoth: Polish or precision @C?|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Surely 2H wasn't bid|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I would assume not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H? I doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S more likely|pg||
nt|johnjones:  2C would be fine also.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  even 2@d would be better :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Compton asked for an undo. After some consideration she thought 2@H was a wee bit wet :)|pg||
nt|johnjones:  we believe so.  The operator did an "undo", but then put 2H back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not 2@H again :)|pg||
nt|ritong: internet is magic, but we are demanding:) when it goes somewhat wrong we get ceazy|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  You better believe it!|pg||
nt|ritong: this is a pure creation lol|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I'm predicting 2C when it gets sorted out.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: vugraph software may allow "illegal" auctions like this since in real life, insufficient bids can be accepted. I have a similar BBO screenshot saved from an earlier vugraph|pg||
nt|ritong: pity, because this hand is interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is nothing illegal about 2@H. Unwise perhaps but not illegal|pg||
nt|hackenbush: I mean the 2nd 2@h, by east|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Obviously 13 tricks in NT, hearts or clubs are easy, but grands with exactly 13 tricks are tough.|pg||
nt|ritong: that was exactly our comment other room|pg||
nt|ritong: great minds drink alike, they say|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Even a small slam requires a decent auction.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: z drugiej strony wywo³awczoæ kontry dochodzi do ciany - kiedy S by siê tylko po kontrze partnera obliza³|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: good to remember that you must be alert until the last trick|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  That makes the Club lead a lot easier to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NL juniors bid 7NT against Israel after the Israelis saved in 7@S over 7@H|pg||
nt|garden2005: znowu ciekawie siê robi|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a likely swing to France, West shall have lead @cKQ.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Precision apparently|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the bidding is probably different than what we can see other room|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  This can go down on perfect defense|pg||
nt|joecritter:  There's the David Soukup I know|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Does E find the K of H lead?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2@h would be a nice and cozy contract here.|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  Another monster swing|pg||
