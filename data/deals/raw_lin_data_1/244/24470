nt|malipivo:  *hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|malipivo:  4-card side suit in North is useful on this deal.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|toniemme: Ciao a tutti e benvenuti all'incontro Italia Francia ragazze che inaugura il girone di ritorno..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h looks like -1|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We would loose a spade, 2 diamonds and a club in 4@h.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|malipivo:  *lose, I am sorry|pg||

mb|p|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|c9|nt|malipivo:  The question of 5!X is interesting.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|toniemme: licita mitchallistica di sud che propone 3SA.....|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@h|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Juniors, players are aged 25 or younger.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|malipivo:  @sT is very useful in North's hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  g'day! welcome!|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|frankaus: scores to date at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  The other table is in 4@hN.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Our first swing today is coming.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  Declarer will shorten East's trump soon via clubs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And now finessing all cards against South.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c6|nt|malipivo:  I must admit that I am kibitzing third match with Argentina in it and I am already a fan of their team.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  I am also crossing fingers to Netherlands as Ms. Ticha, a Czech player, is playing there.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: bulgaria needs a good day to makr Rof8|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|malipivo:  So play was different than we saw. :( It happens.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Our first push board is coming.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|toniemme: nord dovrebbe licitare 1@H e sud replicare 1@S (nord potrebbe avere 44 nobile e in qualche raro caso 33 nobile)..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  First imps to Argentina.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I will explain, it is happening at this tournament:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If N-S gets to a slam, it looks it is there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: welcome back I'll repeat the live scoring site http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A small mistake by vugraph operator leads to a different line.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  Yes, very true spectators, we saw a line where declarer had to be endplayed, not his opponent.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6 imps to Bulgaria as the other room played 4@h=.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|malipivo:  Leading a diamond is difficult for South.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|toniemme: dalle prime due licite parrebbe chiaro che a Sud piaccia "decidere" i boards in fase licitativa...fortuna vuole che il compagno non abbia 8 o 9 punti..cosa del tutto possibile|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|malipivo:  Another swing is coming as other table is playing 6@sS.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|snigill: these teams are now number 4 and 5 when 2 days are left of the round robin|pg||
nt|copeyj: This auction was surprising - I would have thought if you chose to bid stayman with L'Huissier's hand you would follow it by bidding 2@H over 2@D to offer partner a choice of ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: majors|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|frankaus: last hand reminds me of a "ditti" - Q.  what do u lead from QJxx  ... A.... another suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  North is enjoying a game of bridge very much at the moment.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|malipivo:  from spec: 6 @S only goes down with @S lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|malipivo:  I have missed first tricks as typing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is an opportunity for Argentina, they are still bidding.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is thin slam, but which aren't?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|copeyj: down 3 is obtainable by drawing trumps - I think I would have rather played @DQ on second round of the suit from North but this is fine|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|malipivo:  The other room is in 3@cW.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  We may open more windows and see other tables via:|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c7|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|malipivo:  Declarer is crossruffing in the other room.|pg||
nt|copeyj: well defended by the Chinese to get the maximum|pg||
mc|5|nt|malipivo:  But it is not over yet.|pg||
nt|snigill: yes and should be a few imps to China|pg||

nt|toniemme: 2..:)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: There is a possible heart ruff.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  As he is out of trumps.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They avoided it: 3!nS.|pg||
nt|snigill: a decent hand south has got there|pg||
nt|copeyj: possible 4@S here for N/S - we have all been in worse contracts but with @C 5-1 and trumps 4-1 this doesn't seem to stand much chance|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|uni_dennis: NS play 1@S = 0-4@s, 1NT would be 5+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: we'll check that score for you|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: 1@S=0-4 @S F1R|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|copeyj: would be nice to be able to bid 3@C invitational 5-5 here I suppose - perhaps this 2@C is gazilli|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kiwibridge: 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is probably considering reopening.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h looks as a make.|pg||
mb|d|nt|malipivo:  This is going to be a match to be remembered!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: Declarer thinking a lot.|pg||
nt|copeyj: if that is the case then 2@C shows @S/@C 11-15 or any hand 16+|pg||
nt|snigill: 4 spades is a very good contract but...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|malipivo:  3@c looked as a fine contract.|pg||
nt|copeyj: and 2@D probably says we are going to game opposite the strong variety|pg||
nt|snigill: bad bridge not to reach there|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: il contro di nord potrebbe essere ..entrambi i nobili oppure almeno 4 carte di cuori..almeno utilizzando le due più normali accezioni del contro sull'intervento di 1@D..|pg||
mb|3N|nt|uni_dennis: EW can make 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Hearts are easily developed here, but transportation is a major problem.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  After two rounds of heart ducking.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A club ruff would be 4th trick to the defence.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|toniemme: 10 assi per il giocante che non avrà problemi nonostante trovi il resto delle @S diviso 4 e 1..|pg||
pc|dT|nt|malipivo:  Also spades are blocked.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am counting upto 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hackenbush: if anybody's gonna bid it's West with the stiff diamond and the black suits|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A spade and another room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So even 3@h might go down.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|copeyj: this is a slightly fortunate result for China in that you would want to play 4@S I think - but no game makes on this layout|pg||
nt|snigill: should be 7 tricks with this hans south should be more willing to play trumos rather than nt don´t you think?|pg||
nt|snigill: trumps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is defending well, to be fair.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c3|pc|h2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And crossruffing for 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  OR is in 4@hS.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|copeyj: and I think it is down 1 only|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|snigill: d 1|pg||
nt|snigill: true|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c4|nt|toniemme: scarto della cuori inutile..a prescindere dal significato delle @D giocate da est(un giocatore avrebbe il diritto di sbagkliare carta..) il taglio di 9 di @S si imponeva..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, overtaking was a small mistake from West.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c5|pc|h9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|malipivo:  and now: @dA or @sA?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the 1@s bid here kept E a little out of the bidding as DBL might have shown @ss instead of take-out for the minors|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s6|nt|malipivo:  Not over!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jafa: Milne had a fair inferential count and decided to play South for Qxx heart, rather than Txx or xxx|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|toniemme: al board 2 L'Italia dimezza il distacco..|pg||
