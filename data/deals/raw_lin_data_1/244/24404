nt|malipivo:  Even after @dT9 East is covering and securing a trick in diamond suit.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  if North covers, declarer has to play @dQ and discard a club|pg||

nt|malipivo:  West could bid hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  That's exactly what East needs from him.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Reopening is kind of risky with useless @sQ and 1=4=4=4 distribution.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now East thinks that partner isn't having 4 hearts, it is dangerous thought.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gronkvist:  Dbl showed 4+@s and 1@s showed 2-3 @s|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Micke is usually North and Ida South, right Johan?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This sequence will probably ends in 3@d or 3@h.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room in 4@h, but I am afraid it is going down.|pg||
nt|dburn: but 4@c is... well, it is not clear that it is even a cue bid|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is just happy he is having strong hand, who wouldn't be? |pg||
nt|dburn: and even if it is, Huber should not be looking at a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  very true|pg||
mb|3N|nt|uni_dennis: 5@d doomed on a @s lead|pg||

pc|d5|nt|johnjones:  Declarer can now afford to duck a spade for communication.  That wouldn't have been possible on  a trump lead.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer will need to be in the moment here and play carefully for the slam. It's easy to let excitement as a well bid hand get to best of you.|pg||

nt|ianmcc: Andy has embarrassment of riches|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sJxx is providing a safety trick for declarer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  An opportunity for Chinese team.|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|keylime:  Very good lead. Declarer does not have that friendly of splits here, and cards are not well placed either.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  3NT is also an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sort of auctions there's not a lot of point leading @s as partner didn't raise and RHO surely has a robust stopper|pg||
mb|6H|nt|keylime:  Probably a result of the slam; the need to bid a close game to get imps back.|pg||

nt|rigas_karo: yes EW are doing a good job disturbing NS|pg||
pc|d7|nt|uni_dennis: south should have shown that he has @sA, i think|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Over 1@H?|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I mean 2NT instead of 2D over 1H|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but not today|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would play clubs even it is not best here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cicus: NS start from 8 tricks only|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Unbalanced 4-card supp for spades|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4333 hand with great intermediates leans South into the 3NT contract on the 9 card major suit fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With a balanced hand and 4-c support they go through 2@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|johnjones:  Thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  From South's view, the hand will be slowly played, hence the lower game contract.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am missing @sJ and I am still unaware of spades distribution.|pg||

pc|h5|nt|malipivo:  12-imp swing coming|pg||
nt|cicus: it is mandatory to find @HK|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is enjoying this hand most.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and a heart return is safe|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and a club and East won't enjoy this hand anymore|pg||
nt|cicus: here is where knowing style matters - how strong 1NT should be|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|cicus: I think W not leading a heart was a strong indication he did not have AK|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a small mistake by declarer|pg||

nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, that's necessity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  as there is no entry to East hand|pg||
nt|cicus: not now as W can pick up spades for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is a lovely textbook example and if it is not, it should be.|pg||
nt|cicus: so infact there are now many ways to make the contract|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: there is one now @S10|pg||
pc|d8|nt|uni_dennis: but 3NT will also make|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: and padon bids 7@s over it|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and NS bid 7NT, so 11 imps to Netherlands|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|keylime:  I want to thank the specs for their help, BBO for the event, and fellow commentators. Signing off for now.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Except for the hand the Jeng's overbid to 3NT, we have watched some pretty good bridge here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  That we have John.|pg||
nt|keylime:  And I think the 3NT was influenced by the club slam.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Yes, although maybe that is a lesson to be learned not to compund your difficulties.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The 6C slam was pretty.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The slam fit their methods well, and the evaluation pivotal.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Some interesting matchups for RR3 coming|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I'm curious how 5D was allowed to make at the other table on this last hand.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Appears that the heart was never allowed to be cashed. Declarer won the trump ace and played a club. Spade return and that's that.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  That would explain it.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Two matches left to finish|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|h3|pg||
