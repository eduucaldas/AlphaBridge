nt|andyv:  3@d may have been a stretch but the double by W is hard one to believe since he can't see too many defensive tricks...almost feel like he meant it as responsive|pg||

nt|malipivo:  A small mistake by vugraph operator leads to a different line.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Yes, very true spectators, we saw a line where declarer had to be endplayed, not his opponent.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6 imps to Bulgaria as the other room played 4@h=.|pg||
nt|andyv:  good bid as it rates to go down only 2|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Leading a diamond is difficult for South.|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: dalle prime due licite parrebbe chiaro che a Sud piaccia "decidere" i boards in fase licitativa...fortuna vuole che il compagno non abbia 8 o 9 punti..cosa del tutto possibile|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  5@h can be made as the Ace of @h is stiff and declarer should be able to work out the club situation (E will run out of space to hold too many clubs)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: 6 @S only goes down with @S lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|malipivo:  I have missed first tricks as typing.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  from spec: 1@S=0-4 @S F1R|pg||

nt|the_clown:  would you bid with the E cards?|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|copeyj: would be nice to be able to bid 3@C invitational 5-5 here I suppose - perhaps this 2@C is gazilli|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kiwibridge: 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is probably considering reopening.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h looks as a make.|pg||
nt|jafa: Important match for both teams, Denmark currently occupy the last qualifying spot (8th) while Australia are in 2nd and within striking distance of the leaders|pg||
nt|andyv:  you hate to sell out, but wrong vul|pg||
nt|the_clown:  I guess 2N is invit+ with 4 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  This is going to be a match to be remembered!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: Declarer thinking a lot.|pg||
nt|copeyj: if that is the case then 2@C shows @S/@C 11-15 or any hand 16+|pg||
nt|snigill: 4 spades is a very good contract but...|pg||
nt|nickf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  3@c looked as a fine contract.|pg||
nt|copeyj: and 2@D probably says we are going to game opposite the strong variety|pg||
nt|snigill: bad bridge not to reach there|pg||
nt|the_clown:  and could be based on a very good fit and fewer HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: il contro di nord potrebbe essere ..entrambi i nobili oppure almeno 4 carte di cuori..almeno utilizzando le due più normali accezioni del contro sull'intervento di 1@D..|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|uni_dennis: EW can make 3@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive game will go down....one finesse works, the other doesn't|pg||
pc|s3|nt|the_clown:  y W has all the time in the world to switch to a @c|pg||

nt|jafa: only one chance|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  After two rounds of heart ducking.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A club ruff would be 4th trick to the defence.|pg||
nt|the_clown:  ah I missed that declarer can get to dummy with a @s ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|toniemme: 10 assi per il giocante che non avrà problemi nonostante trovi il resto delle @S diviso 4 e 1..|pg||
pc|d3|nt|malipivo:  Also spades are blocked.|pg||

mb|p|nt|toniemme: le francesi tirano fino a 4@S (notare che est decide di licitare le @S..e non le cuori:):)..e 5 punti ci portano a condurre il match..|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kiwibridge: looks like 2@C was GF|pg||

nt|toniemme: avrebbe fatto meglio a passare..talvolta il compagno ha 5 carte di fiori..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so the captains have to check the scores after this match|pg||

mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  It will be interesting to check the results from other tables.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jafa: if he plays a club to the king and then a diamond to the queen and ace, the defenders would be able to knock out his last entry to hand|pg||
nt|jafa: but with the AD in S, all is well|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  well, 2@s would be on if it stays this way|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 10: 2 imps at stake as 2 overtricks mean 60 points. Players scored maximum in this room.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In a possible heart slam, defence must cash diamonds soon, as spade finesse (@sT) and also double finesse in clubs (@cQJ) provide enough winners to discard a @d6. Otherwise it would be 6@h+1.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But this is a theory.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's think about 7@dX N-S, how many tricks it would go down?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kiwibridge: Australia need something now|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 3@C usually 5-5 already, so supporting @c looks best|pg||
