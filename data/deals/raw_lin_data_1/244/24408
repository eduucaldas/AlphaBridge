nt|malipivo:  We are going to have a beautiful day here as it is a bridge day. I am going to cross my fingers to all the teams wishing them all the best (esp. bid, play and defend all the slams)! Also we wish good luck to our Vugraph operator!|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Brief information about the format:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the Junior and Youngsters series, a qualifier will be played first, in the form of a single round robin of 16-board matches. The top eight teams in each series will advance to the knockout stage. There is no Bye round.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are still in early stages of the round robin playing 16 boards.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Youngsters, round 4, according to this plan:|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  quiet hand to start with|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|uni_dennis: 6@s and 6@c on a finesse here, but i doubt they bid it|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Hi all|pg||
pc|hK|nt|uni_dennis: also needs black suits to behave|pg||
pc|hA|nt|uni_dennis: 2@d GF checkback|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hackenbush: other table also in 3nt|pg||
pc|c6|nt|malipivo:  They didn't introduce a club suit, so diamond slam it is.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|uni_dennis: this is round 5 of 19 in the round robin|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||

If battaggia didn't want to take the risk of playing three rounds of spades, he had better take in dummy and lead trumps to his hand, which makes a huge difference if north holds the singleton ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: israel in 6@s in the other room on bd 1|pg||
nt|malipivo:  France was 4th in the last European Team Championships.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|uni_dennis: W showed a @h-splinter after he heard @s-fit and E bid the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|uni_dennis: exciting deal, but no one can really make anything, 3@s and 4@c the max.|pg||

mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Open Room is playing 4@cN. There was no desire to try 3!n.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's see if they bid 4@s, it has its chances.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  does anyone know the exact meaning of 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Hi everyone!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the preempt did his work here|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@d from defenders?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, not today.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3NT mesns 16 19 6+S|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  looks very unlikely that declarer will get 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|johnjones:  Roger might try 3H instead of the more obvious 3NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In this deal hearts are sitting nicely.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|johnjones:  This won't challenge W at all.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hackenbush: actually declarer can't easily make use of this extra diamond trick|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|johnjones:  He'll play HA, and a H|pg||
nt|hackenbush: then another diamond will put him to a decision|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Lee takes his time. In the last World University Bridge Championship, he took 10 minutes for a play decision in a slam|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Then he will go for several hands and play at the speed of light.  But when he thinks, it will be for a while.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is buying 5@dX.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  now there's a chance|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|johnjones:  A club lead will defeat 6.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: other room 4@sX|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: N bid 3NT over 3@s there and then doubled 4@s|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|johnjones:  Should be a quick claim.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|h5|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|malipivo:  and it continues there, 5@h-6@c-X|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6@d|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c3|nt|hackenbush: a sensible choice, enjoying the hearts without needing to commit to a club guess. Now @cK exit after cashing hearts will see him home|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|malipivo:  so major swing is coming one way or the other|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|johnjones:  We may be here a while.  I had Roger take 25 minutes to play a hand against me in a home team game.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  North is very tied up though.  I'm betting on Roger.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was much easier for E in the open room|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Could we see a pass of 1S X here/|pg||
nt|malipivo:  as I see slams everywhere, this must be one of them|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a spade and a diamond loser is there|pg||
pc|s6|nt|malipivo:  There is many of you, I am just one (even weighting 250 pounds, 115 kg). With the help of Dealer's will I won't make many mistakes today. :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  China currently standing 2nd (140 VPs), Costa Rica currently standing 19th (55 VPs).|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  this doesn't look like he can get 8 tricks. Let's see how lotan tackles this|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|hackenbush: down 2 at least|pg||
nt|malipivo:  My morning praying for slams is fulfulling as there is our second.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If interested, my today's morning kicker is (Gothic music; The Gathering: Mandylion): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYBu10QBut0|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@d a Bergen Raise, but CC doesn't say how strong, 10-11 presumably|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|johnjones:  NS missed game for +170 only, so this will be the first real blood of the match!!!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is real bridge, so a peaceful contract and fight for overtricks.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  On a non-spade lead slam has its chances.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching the 14th World Youth Team Championships:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Information.htm|pg||
pc|c4|nt|malipivo:  We are in the middle stage of the round robin playing 16 boards.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  defence was considering sacrificing, but not today|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Juniors, round 8, according to this plan:|pg||
pc|h3|nt|johnjones:  A typical pushy vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  a trump will be the best lead for the defense|pg||

nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/TaicangScheduleOfPlay.pdf|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results and running scores for all three series here:|pg||
pc|h5|nt|johnjones:  True, but the layout looks friendly enough for both 4H and 3NT to work.  |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hop avoided the @c lead, so will go 1 off|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|hT|nt|malipivo:  Three suits double stopped.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|johnjones:  with the CA wrong, down 1 looks likely|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'd expect a game too many versus a game too few from the juniors.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|johnjones:  Against that, Lee will to well to go down 2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They went down in 4@h in the Open Room.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|malipivo:  Declarer lead trumps too early forgetting his only chance: clubs.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@sX -1 on bd 2, so 7 imps back to Netherlands|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  Board 2 is a 12-imp victory for France.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the endgame, they developed them, but it was too late.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|johnjones:  Anything but a C now and declarer is sunk|pg||
nt|keylime:  I can't see North breaking open what appears to him/her as a half-frozen suit.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|hackenbush: heading towards 3 down, if NS collects the @dK|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|johnjones:  Even then, declarer would probably go wrong.  Grant Baze used to teach to guess the leader for the Ace in a premature underlead situation.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  A push board, interesting was to consider 3!n as defence cannot attack two suits at once.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We were expecing +1, never mind.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|uni_dennis: not sure why N did not start with a take-out DBL|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Defense didn't slipped here, taking their fast spade winners.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  The advantage of @hJ9xx can be seen, but can be finessed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  @h76 are very useful on this deal|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  we dont see any comparisons here, but 7-2 too brazil after 2 boards, 2@s= on board 2|pg||
mb|3D|nt|malipivo:  Or one imp for Argentina if they find some overtricks and they should and there is no spade lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|johnjones:  The defense appears to have 5 D and 2 S before declarer can get in|pg||
pc|sT|nt|malipivo:  Our attention goes to diamonds, which is crucial on this deal.|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|malipivo:  Spades are friendly too as breaking 3-3.|pg||

pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  Heart continuation is expected here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is getting endplayed in two suits.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  but getting him to trouble|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|keylime:  Might be able to arrange an endplay here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even after @dT9 East is covering and securing a trick in diamond suit.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|malipivo:  if North covers, declarer has to play @dQ and discard a club|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and ruff a club|pg||
nt|malipivo:  To be able to get back to hand for last round of finesse.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  now 8@h is blocking the suit and he might be forced to do that anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  spades are no longer helping as an entry thanks to that duck|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|keylime:  A@c, K@c, club exit. |pg||
nt|malipivo:  There was no inference in bidding, so likely to play @hT.|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|johnjones:  E needed that C he pitched|pg||

mb|3S|nt|dburn: curious bidding at the other table, where North cue-bid six diamonds, got six spades from partner and bid seven anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  good morning|pg||
nt|dburn: but it makes sense - since partner did not bid six hearts, maybe everything he had was in clubs|pg||

mb|d|nt|dburn: not going to be so easy for England after North opened with an artificial bid instead of a natural one|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is not risking and passes.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 7.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If passing this, 2 imps to China.|pg||

mb|4S|nt|dburn: not that I blame him|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We see 6 fast winners and some will be done for the 7th.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  it might be interesting to see 3!n E-W losing only 4 aces|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sAJ were onside, @dJ as well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, it is a theory|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3 tens on this board were helping a lot|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and 3 nines as well|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  likely that brazil will be in 3nt on board 4, after all they do have 26hp|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I don't like 6 card suits in 1NT so it always pleases me when it gets punished|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse is possible in clubs, but there is not enough transportation.|pg||

pc|cK|nt|malipivo:  7@d may force N-S to 7@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West didn't buy it and didn't cover with queen.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|johnjones:  The Swedes appear to be playing that 3C would be a high level reverse and show extras.  That is a very sensible agreement.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Other table had a very lengthy, relay auction to the excellent contract of 6@d.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|johnjones:  He had a Precison 2C bid available - it would have worked better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  EW clearly play very constructive preempts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|keylime:  I agree; bidding 3@c here if you're a pattern bidder, causes problems due to the room once takes to show a club suit. I myself would rather rebid 2@h as a waiting call here then the 3@c bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it might|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: but they'll get some back here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|johnjones:  A spec messages me they do play 3C as a high level reverse - thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  North's hand should be prime now, and South with four shiny bullets might take a stab at grand here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4-1 diamond break coupled with the heart position hurts the chance for grand here a bit.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A grand is excellent without a trump lead, but iffy with a trump lead|pg||
nt|keylime:  You'd need entries, which at 7 on a trump lead becomes perilous.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec tells me they choose a natural sequence, but had relays available|pg||
nt|johnjones:  If that is the case, that shows excellent judgement because it put weight on the KD|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we may count a lot of tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe it should have done|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  fast winner counting: 1-2 hearts, 6 diamonds and two 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|keylime:  And the T too. Both prime cards here.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|keylime:  Nice natural auction here to a likely push. Well done.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Which might be found with relays, but sometimes relays run out of room to find all exact cards.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially with pinpointing 5-5 hands. The frequencies are not as friendly as the 5431 hands.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I like South's decision to go natural, but think he wimped a little in not bidding the grand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a fair game here, reached after the opening instead of preempt. Needs 3-2 trumps and @hA onside, or some defensive help|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Good point|pg||
nt|keylime:  West has made a nice lead here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer doesn't know clubs are 3-3 and that hearts are not 5-2. So entry management will be important.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|johnjones:  He'll be happy to not lose a trump trick though.|pg||
nt|keylime:  16 board segments for the Youth Teams in the RR.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  without a D lead it will make 5|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|malipivo:  This is hard to get East on trump endplay.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|uni_dennis: 1NT overcall very agressive here with just 14hcp, no real suit and only Qxx in @h |pg||
pc|d5|nt|keylime:  Playing under Cat 3 of the WBF regs, so no Brown Stickers or HUMs (Highly Unusual Methods).|pg||
pc|d9|nt|malipivo:  and one more heart to the Polish team|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|malipivo:  5@s might be on as double finessing in clubs is working|pg||

nt|malipivo:  This would be a risky one, but we may expect to see it at some tables.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the open room padon made a take-out dbl over 3@d lifting NS to 4@d, but that was still an easy make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|malipivo:  On this deal a low heart from West to @hT is working.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|malipivo:  A diamond lead wouldn't be nice as it also kills one transport to West hand.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|johnjones:  Another sensible decision by North this time.  The H values aren't working, so he stayed off a direct raise.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So nice bids here|pg||
nt|keylime:  Their teammates going two off red in the other room, makes this important to make +140 to cover some of the loss.|pg||
nt|keylime:  In the other room, South overcalled a strong NT with a multi 2@d overcall, which drove W/E into 3NT.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The other room was down 2 in 3NT, which definately doesn't get the "sensible" award, although Multi is tough to deal with|pg||
nt|keylime:  Ten tricks are available here for South. The heart will jettison a club and the K@s is in the slot.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect that N/S in the other room maybe playing Multi-Landy or something similar.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|johnjones:  For American  (ACBL) spectators, there is no written defense allowed in this competition|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|malipivo:  South might bid 4@d, just to say he is having support, leading from KJT is not easy.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|keylime:  That's right, so unlike here in the US, where certain items played permit the opponents of that treatment to have written defenses, on site it is all in the brain.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c6|nt|keylime:  There was a hand a few years ago, if memory serves Freeman-Nickwell were defending against the Multi 2@d opening. They had 15 pages (!) of notes for the Multi they were allowed to use to get to an excellent slam.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|malipivo:  From our perspective it is easy to see everything.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: It helps when you have everything in writing. Pathetic|pg||
nt|keylime:  And Roland, in our mid-chart events, we can play any defense over 1NT, without any disclosed defenses.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The ACBL is ridiculous in its treatment of Multi defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Outside the US you have to remember stuff. We call bridge a mind game|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|nt|keylime:  Yet, xfers over natural 1 club opening demand a written defense, and that is a lot easier to cope with.|pg||

pc|d7|pc|c5|nt|keylime:  Ah - I normally play Precision 1@c so that would make sense.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Summary of the first half of this match:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  36-imp difference and|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  We have a football score.  6-3 one field goal to two field goals.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The symmetry in North-South hand is killing all the possibilities.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: helmich not interested with this hand of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  A quick down 1|pg||
nt|dburn: here, you would like it if North had a real negative available|pg||
nt|malipivo:  23-7 VPs in favor of China|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and still living opportunity for a swing on this deal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West could bid hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  That's exactly what East needs from him.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Reopening is kind of risky with useless @sQ and 1=4=4=4 distribution.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now East thinks that partner isn't having 4 hearts, it is dangerous thought.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gronkvist:  Dbl showed 4+@s and 1@s showed 2-3 @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In a balanced 11-13?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS opens all bal hand 12-14/18-19 with 1@c and then play trf and relays after that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke is usually North and Ida South, right Johan?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This sequence will probably ends in 3@d or 3@h.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room in 4@h, but I am afraid it is going down.|pg||
nt|dburn: but 4@c is... well, it is not clear that it is even a cue bid|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is just happy he is having strong hand, who wouldn't be? |pg||
nt|dburn: and even if it is, Huber should not be looking at a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  very true|pg||
pc|d9|nt|uni_dennis: 5@d doomed on a @s lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3-imp difference, 16-14 in favor of Argentina|pg||
nt|malipivo:  On of the players must be bid aggressively to get there.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

pc|dT|nt|gronkvist:  studying 17 and 19 y brother and sister ;)|pg||
nt|dburn: if he wants to raise to 4@h no one would crime him, but 4@c shows clubs, not hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and Illingworth has raised those "clubs", as well he should|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East in Open Room leads @sK.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|malipivo:  None players are breathing right now.|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a swing for Costa Rica.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I will rather eat my hat if he plays low.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: East in Closed Room may be of the same mind|pg||

pc|s8|nt|johnjones:  Declarer can now afford to duck a spade for communication.  That wouldn't have been possible on  a trump lead.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer will need to be in the moment here and play carefully for the slam. It's easy to let excitement as a well bid hand get to best of you.|pg||

nt|johnjones:  3NT is also an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sort of auctions there's not a lot of point leading @s as partner didn't raise and RHO surely has a robust stopper|pg||
pc|hK|nt|keylime:  Probably a result of the slam; the need to bid a close game to get imps back.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  It looks like.|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: tough now - S will have to pass and N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: in open room bd 11 NS were having a misunderstanding in the bidding, as N passed 2@c |pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n from South would be reasonable now.|pg||
nt|cicus: not on a 5 count|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, that's true|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am too on double dummy.|pg||
nt|cicus: N had an option to bid 2NT right away though|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  N/S got very high here and paid handsomely.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is cold here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now dealer is testing their bidding to 4@s.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|uni_dennis: but East is to the rescue with DBL|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: depends on what you mean by "opportunity" - against 6@d, West would have had the opportunity to lead a low heart and get a club ruff|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: expect them to land to 3NT here will probably bid 2@s now|pg||
nt|cicus: I think he has too many losers to bid this high|pg||
pc|d4|nt|uni_dennis: think 2NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  reopening would be nice from North.|pg||
nt|cicus: 5 losers - partner will raise 4@D with 3 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|keylime:  W/E have an incredibly lucky minor position being 3-3.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|malipivo:  And it is not, well done England!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: need to find the @C ruff to win the board here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT would be off on a @s lead, but 2NT can be made if declarer gets 4@d tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  two tens are helping|pg||
nt|cicus: even 4@D is a stretch when partner could not act over 3@H|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 11, they are in 3@dS.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  I am kidding.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  4@sX would be -3, I guess|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|cicus: I think W not leading a heart was a strong indication he did not have AK|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Also thanks go to my co-commentators, it was fun!|pg||
mb|2H|an|5spades and 4 hearts|nt|keylime:  Defense at the other table at 5@d it looks like it didn't get their tricks.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|uni_dennis: will make. losing 2@s and a @h|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a partscore battle to close the playing day.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Maybe a C can go away if ducked once|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, that's necessity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  as there is no entry to East hand|pg||
nt|cicus: not now as W can pick up spades for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is a lovely textbook example and if it is not, it should be.|pg||
nt|cicus: so infact there are now many ways to make the contract|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: there is one now @S10|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but 3NT will also make|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|malipivo:  And swing coming to England.|pg||

nt|cicus: @S87|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|keylime:  Defense if they have listened can work out a club return|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s2|nt|greenhand: safety  play on  diamond  was  the  best  way  to  make  it|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: so 2 potential swing boards to end the session with|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: he will make 6 now|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 7@h bid by NL on 15 in the open room|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and padon bids 7@s over it|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and NS bid 7NT, so 11 imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: it was Vulnerable, so 13 imps even|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|keylime:  I want to thank the specs for their help, BBO for the event, and fellow commentators. Signing off for now.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Except for the hand the Jeng's overbid to 3NT, we have watched some pretty good bridge here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  That we have John.|pg||
nt|keylime:  And I think the 3NT was influenced by the club slam.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Yes, although maybe that is a lesson to be learned not to compund your difficulties.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The 6C slam was pretty.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The slam fit their methods well, and the evaluation pivotal.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Some interesting matchups for RR3 coming|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I'm curious how 5D was allowed to make at the other table on this last hand.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Appears that the heart was never allowed to be cashed. Declarer won the trump ace and played a club. Spade return and that's that.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  That would explain it.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Two matches left to finish|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|cicus: by retaining @S10 for a reentry, W can take now all tricks|pg||
