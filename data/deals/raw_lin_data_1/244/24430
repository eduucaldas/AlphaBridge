If battaggia didn't want to take the risk of playing three rounds of spades, he had better take in dummy and lead trumps to his hand, which makes a huge difference if north holds the singleton ace|pg||

nt|hackenbush: Lee takes his time. In the last World University Bridge Championship, he took 10 minutes for a play decision in a slam|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Then he will go for several hands and play at the speed of light.  But when he thinks, it will be for a while.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Much|pg||
nt|keylime:  Can North in the relays ask for controls?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the mirrored cards in @s are horrible for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South might not do all that much battling|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@h is on|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|cicus: I don' think so|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|dburn: but South might well have led a trump, not a spade|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse in spades is being slowly developed.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: was interesting what to do as south|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cicus: after 2 spades and 2 diamonds W can lead a 3rd spade|pg||

nt|ianmcc: low from 3 small the trouble|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|johnjones:  6C makes on the actual layout, but declarer would find a trump lead nasty.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: bd 9 4@h -1, so another push|pg||
nt|malipivo:  even now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mrdct: NS lead 3rd from even and low from odd|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|keylime:  Very good bidding. Now, will another trump lead come from West?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|johnjones:  Declarer can now afford to duck a spade for communication.  That wouldn't have been possible on  a trump lead.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer will need to be in the moment here and play carefully for the slam. It's easy to let excitement as a well bid hand get to best of you.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  This will be the first swing in the match that doesn't involve undertricks or overtricks|pg||
nt|ianmcc: reprieve|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am sorry, we are in 2@s.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|malipivo:  The other table is frozen.|pg||

mb|p|nt|keylime:  2@d would be fourth suit forcing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A risky 6@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They would need a swing of this magnitude.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hi konstatinos|pg||
nt|cicus: W has a nice hand for @Hs so he has to do something other than lazily raising to 4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have some options on this deal: finessing @cK or squeezing South in minor suits.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  We are seeing good judgement and nice card play from 4 youngsters whose combined aged is 62 (younger than many of us).|pg||

nt|malipivo:  @sJxx is providing a safety trick for declarer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  An opportunity for Chinese team.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime:  Very good lead. Declarer does not have that friendly of splits here, and cards are not well placed either.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  3NT is also an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sort of auctions there's not a lot of point leading @s as partner didn't raise and RHO surely has a robust stopper|pg||
nt|z_lasu: jakies miliony stoja|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tak¹ obronê to nawet 50 lat temu bym nie wymyli³|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Thx Johan|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer is going to get squeezed here possibly.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|keylime:  I can understand if red. |pg||

mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 4@d on a 6322 even, real junior|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Also thanks go to my co-commentators, it was fun!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|keylime:  Defense at the other table at 5@d it looks like it didn't get their tricks.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  5D fails on a losing trump finesse.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Last, but not least, our thanks go to our Vugraph operator! Very well done!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I think this canbe made by ducking a @D|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Next round starts in 30 minutes according to the BBO plan:|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: will make. losing 2@s and a @h|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a partscore battle to close the playing day.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|johnjones:  Maybe a C can go away if ducked once|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, that's necessity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  as there is no entry to East hand|pg||
nt|cicus: not now as W can pick up spades for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is a lovely textbook example and if it is not, it should be.|pg||
nt|cicus: so infact there are now many ways to make the contract|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: there is one now @S10|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no i rewan¿, choæ nie tak krway siê uda³|pg||
pc|c2|nt|uni_dennis: but 3NT will also make|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And swing coming to England.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: @S(= provides a finessing opportunity|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cicus: @S87|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|keylime:  Defense if they have listened can work out a club return|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|greenhand: safety  play on  diamond  was  the  best  way  to  make  it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|uni_dennis: so 2 potential swing boards to end the session with|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: he will make 6 now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|uni_dennis: ok, thanks all for watching. we will be back in 1 hour with session 6|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 7@h bid by NL on 15 in the open room|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and padon bids 7@s over it|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and NS bid 7NT, so 11 imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: it was Vulnerable, so 13 imps even|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|keylime:  I want to thank the specs for their help, BBO for the event, and fellow commentators. Signing off for now.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Except for the hand the Jeng's overbid to 3NT, we have watched some pretty good bridge here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  That we have John.|pg||
nt|keylime:  And I think the 3NT was influenced by the club slam.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Yes, although maybe that is a lesson to be learned not to compund your difficulties.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The 6C slam was pretty.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The slam fit their methods well, and the evaluation pivotal.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Some interesting matchups for RR3 coming|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I'm curious how 5D was allowed to make at the other table on this last hand.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Appears that the heart was never allowed to be cashed. Declarer won the trump ace and played a club. Spade return and that's that.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  That would explain it.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Two matches left to finish|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|cicus: by retaining @S10 for a reentry, W can take now all tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|malipivo:  and a major swing to China|pg||
