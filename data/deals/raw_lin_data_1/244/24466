pc|h4|nt|hackenbush: East's opening was risky at vulnerable. With no safety in 1@s, he has to make 2 bids, could easily drift off for several hundreds in a nothing hand|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: or just support @c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am happy to say: a slam zone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  well, 2@s would be on if it stays this way|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 10: 2 imps at stake as 2 overtricks mean 60 points. Players scored maximum in this room.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In a possible heart slam, defence must cash diamonds soon, as spade finesse (@sT) and also double finesse in clubs (@cQJ) provide enough winners to discard a @d6. Otherwise it would be 6@h+1.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But this is a theory.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's think about 7@dX N-S, how many tricks it would go down?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kiwibridge: Australia need something now|pg||
nt|toniemme: il 3@D di nord mette sassolini sulla strada licitativa delle nostra..nell'altra sala il barrage dxi passo non ha sortito effetti..|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: non facile per west passare..vero che p non ha fatto cue bid..ma basterebbe avesse picche decenti perché slam non sia disprezzabile..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@C usually 5-5 already, so supporting @c looks best|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If E-W would attack diamonds at every opportunity, @cT might score the 5th trick for defence.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, E-W in 6@h.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|toniemme: il 3 picche di est è molto discutibile..ma in ogni caso la licita si nord è stata buona...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: W expecting more from East's 2@h call|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: with those big @s behind the opener he doesn't expect them to make 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And now a fight for a overtricks. I am suprised there is no XX.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: he didn't ask himself which defensive tricks he was planning to take|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jafa: 4S RKC for H|pg||

nt|jafa: 5NT shows spade king i believe, so edgtton can bid 7|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Michael, would you be kind enough to explain the auction from 3NT for us|pg||
nt|jafa: 4S was RKC for hearts, 5C 3, 5S confirms all keycards and asks for kings, 5NT SK or other two kings (i think)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: 3NT was a serious slam try?|pg||
nt|jafa: i think they play non serious 3NT, but not 100% on that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks|pg||
nt|jafa: the Argentinian pair at the other table have had a bidding misunderstanding and settled in 5S|pg||

nt|malipivo:  5@cX would be expensive, 7 tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: well, if the dutch juniors don't bid it, it will be a bad contract indeed :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, undoubled :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  they have at least one trick in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@hX on bd 10: @d lead, @s switch, now declarer has a chance to ruff 3@D in dummy|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@hN would be -9, 900, 5@cX -4 for 1100|pg||
