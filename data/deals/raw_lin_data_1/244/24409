nt|malipivo:  A great opportunity for Polish team.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @hA is onside, spades breaking nicely|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Other table is Burke Snowden and Ben Kristensen at E/W and Adam Kaplan and Zach Brescoll at N/S|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Taylor (compton) is a bit under the weather|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  She's trying to recover, but it's hard to focus when you're feeling bad|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So we are watching one of those major battles.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Brief information about the format:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the Girls series, the qualifier will be played as a double round robin of 16-board matches, producing the top four teams. The knockout stage consists of the semifinals and the final and playoff for third place. There is no Bye round.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 4: a push.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a non-slam deal on this one.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Partscore battle is upon us.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We can see it easily (not even 3!n), as E-W are holding diamonds and N-S hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  To be exact: major versus minor suits battle.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nauczone dowiadczeni Amerykanki w 4 zatrzyma³y siê w 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Slam zone!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I believe that 4@s will be found here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  major suit shall win this, but @sA is onside, so who knows?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|malipivo:  7@c, perhaps, let's see!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We might be happy with risky 6@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Open Room is buying 3@h.|pg||
nt|kania12: otwarcie Danuty by³o ostre, ale w dzisiejszych czasach duzo osob tak otwiera|pg||
mb|3N|nt|malipivo:  played from South|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Board 4: 6 imps to Netherlands, as they finished in 2!n=.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  At the moment the Netherlands is winning 20-10 VP.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But this is crucial deal!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: Bidding is going the same way, so far.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: and 3!n it is!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  What an opportunity to Polish team.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Sitting out for the two teams are Arjun Dhir and Murphy Green for USA 2 and Zach and Adam Grossack for USA 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  a crucial moment is coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Netherlands shall be little more offensive, there shall be no winning strategy letting play 1!n.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|malipivo:  Bid and play grand slam and make a bulletin. :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|malipivo:  Oh, well, next time. |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|johnjones:  With trumps 4-2, 2 D losers and the S finesse losing. Taylor will probably have to play well for down 1 even.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  3!n might go down on a accurate defense (4 diamonds and @hA)|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  Contract should be 6S|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

pc|h4|pc|d2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

nt|malipivo:  We are watching nice and stable bridge.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks we are heading to 4@s N-S.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We see four fast losers, but hearts can be develop to discard one club.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  well done!|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: za chwilê pojawi siê szansa na wyrównanie meczu|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it will be hard to beat 800 points from the Open Room|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Nice defense by the French girls.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And now we know all the crucial information about HCP.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So spade finesse is almost certain thing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing 2@s, so a great opportunity to get imps for Poland.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As we can see, spades are 2-2, so third diamond is going away on ruffing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If you are writing a textbook about pretty deals, this is one of them.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East-West cannot take their chances in diamonds, it would be costly.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I almost feel the fear of bidding it, but it is understandable.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If Polish girls are thinking of medal, they have to take some risk.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am afraid of some time penalties.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the meantime, welcome to all newcomers, we are watching Girls, second round of round robin:|pg||

nt|malipivo:  As this is my first Vugraph performance, I welcome any feedback after the show. Thank you in advance!|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  2@d it is, a swing is alive.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And MagdalÃ©na TichÃ¡ in offense, they will miss it (4@s), oh my!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  !n is right sided (see the spades).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So they have fast 7 winners.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But watch the clubs!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  low to @cK, spades and @cA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2!nX is not going to be played, let's 3@d E-W|pg||
nt|malipivo:  1-2 spade losers, a heart and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@dX would be -1 for 200 and an imp to Poland.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Would we double 3@d, so it might be -1 for 100 and 2 imps to Netherlands!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Wow!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And double heart finesse is on, so it might even make.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hawaii in trumps is not nice for the declarer, to be honest.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Another battle is ahead of us. We have got a nice Dealer.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|malipivo:  The defense must be tough if they dislike 4@s N-S.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The Jengs reinvent the Rule of 20 :)|pg||
nt|johnjones:  North should ignore the 4 card Spade suit and transfer to D.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Did I say my morning praying, didn't I?|pg||
nt|kania12: w 5 dla odmiany Natalia majac ladniejsze karty niz Danuta w poprzednim spasowala|pg||
mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  In my opinion, 4S should show a 3S or 3NT response to 2NT without the interference, while a pass should show a 4S response|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Morning praying: Please, Dealer, please, give us one or two slams in every deal, we don't ask that much, do we? Thank you, dear Dealer! Amen. :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The greay is the theory, practically we are getting likely push board.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|coolbeans:  Jeng has a tough task to fulfill|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|johnjones:  North's passing throughout is more than a bit surprising.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|moonbeam42:  I'm sure she was relieved not to have to face the problem of the double being passed back to her|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  3@d made 4 in the other room.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|deltadash: what have I missed Matt?|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Open table is currently in 3N on the EW cards|pg||

mb|p|nt|deltadash: why did we do that, do you know?|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Good pass by North.  We so frequently see high card doubles on 4333 hands.  I dislike that style.|pg||

nt|deltadash: do you know all these guys?|pg||
nt|joecritter:  I joke that I take credit for creating the Soukup Berk monster. Berk's father was competing in the GNT's so I got to teach him the last part of 2/1 he needed. A day later he played with Soukup, slaughtering me and his father in the process|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: Right we of course know there isn't one, but they don't|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, even diamonds behave.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: E has not enough for 6@d, so he should bid 4nt|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: as a very good raise to 5@d|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: so he do|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: now 5@c from W|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: and rather 6@d|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: but still not very clear|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And this is going to be expensive.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|malipivo:  5@d would be cheap for N-S if they find slam in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ok, this is also a way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north has good hopes to beat 6@d so he wont go 6@s|pg||
nt|cicus: of course not|pg||
pc|h5|nt|johnjones:  The agressive 1S overcall by Isha is not really her style, but is on target on this hand.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  It will get Taylor off to the best lead of a S versus a NT contract.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I think she's becoming a little more aggressive to compensate|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h shall go down.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  even two if hearts are misguessed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|coolbeans:  W goes to game after E makes a non-forcing 3S bid after W has already described his hand. Gotta love IMPs|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|malipivo:  Well, grand was risky, I admit that.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 6@S especially ideal given the score at the other table|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As long as South is having 3+ clubs it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Nothing more embarrassing than bieng in 7 down 1 when the other table is not even in 6|pg||
nt|joecritter:  A second lie to make up for the first one?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Two wrongs make a right :)?|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|malipivo:  Or even with two clubs in South's hand it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I think the best line is K@C then A@C, when all follow to 3 rounds, he'll know that N is 0733 and will know exactly what to do.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, very right you are.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: if S ruffs the A@C, then N was 0715, that would not be a 3@H call |pg||
nt|MolvaM: well bid laydown slam with only 23 hcp|pg||

nt|MolvaM: north could have led the @h king asking for unblock|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but that would still be 4 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  an impressive board, one way or the other|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can declarer find the club play?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or will he duck a diamond hoping that the hearts are blocked|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: in the unlikely even A@D is doubleton, a @H pitch is right|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The question is if she can go wrong.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I don't see how, even if you experiment in the other suits, you always have multiple entries|pg||
