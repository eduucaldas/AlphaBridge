mb|1S|mb|d|nt|coolbeans:  We have 4 matches today, so that is why there is a "early" start to the festivities|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|coolbeans:  While I don't know the French team that well, sitting N/S here are Stephen Drodge and Sean Gannon|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Sitting E/W at the other table is Jimmy and Zizhuo Wang|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Sitting out for USA 2 are Erli Zhou and Lei Jin|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  France sits in 2nd at the start of today, while USA 2 needs to jump start their second half ot the rould robin as they sit in 12th place|pg||
pc|d4|nt|coolbeans:  Strange that Lhuissier did not explore for a Heart game considering that E usually shows 4+ @H with his double|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Drodge made a safe lead, and the best continuation here is a @D|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Brief information about the format:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the Junior and Youngsters series, a qualifier will be played first, in the form of a single round robin of 16-board matches. The top eight teams in each series will advance to the knockout stage. There is no Bye round.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are still in early stages of the round robin playing 16 boards.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Youngsters, round 4, according to this plan:|pg||

nt|minimeck: A bit conservative here by wang east, Not a monster but certainly partner will attempt to cater towards a weak takeout, maybe should have given the boost to 3|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  After not being agressive enough, the Wang duo becomes too aggressive and overbids to slam. Let's see what Lhuissier does with these cards|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  The slam is reasonable with 33 combined HCP, but the A and K missing unfortunately are in the same suit. 2 losers off the top.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Also, it can be held to -1 with Gannon holding the 10 of @D|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  They attempt a minor slam, but the outcome will be the same. Down 1 or 2, depending on how E handles the @D|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I mean W. Forgot he bid the @C|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is simply a flat board, even if west takes the conservative route and bids quantitative, east will accept as seen at the other table, next. |pg||

If battaggia didn't want to take the risk of playing three rounds of spades, he had better take in dummy and lead trumps to his hand, which makes a huge difference if north holds the singleton ace|pg||
mb|2N|nt|uni_dennis: israel in 6@s in the other room on bd 1|pg||
nt|malipivo:  France was 4th in the last European Team Championships.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: W showed a @h-splinter after he heard @s-fit and E bid the slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: Chance for a french pickup out of the gate. slam time in hcp, missing cashing AK :)|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: exciting deal, but no one can really make anything, 3@s and 4@c the max.|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|malipivo:  We are watching Juniors, round 6, according to this plan:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/TaicangScheduleOfPlay.pdf|pg||
nt|minimeck: unfortunately no need to lead it even, hopelessly mirrored and only 10 tricks |pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|malipivo:  Open Room is playing 4@cN. There was no desire to try 3!n.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's see if they bid 4@s, it has its chances.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  does anyone know the exact meaning of 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: Well done to any pair here who can put on the brakes, suspect alot of -10's across the field|pg||
mb|6N|nt|johnjones:  Hi everyone!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the preempt did his work here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: -50's|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|malipivo:  5@d from defenders?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, not today.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3NT mesns 16 19 6+S|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  looks very unlikely that declarer will get 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|johnjones:  Roger might try 3H instead of the more obvious 3NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In this deal hearts are sitting nicely.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|johnjones:  This won't challenge W at all.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hackenbush: actually declarer can't easily make use of this extra diamond trick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|johnjones:  He'll play HA, and a H|pg||
nt|hackenbush: then another diamond will put him to a decision|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Lee takes his time. In the last World University Bridge Championship, he took 10 minutes for a play decision in a slam|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Then he will go for several hands and play at the speed of light.  But when he thinks, it will be for a while.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is buying 5@dX.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  now there's a chance|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|johnjones:  A club lead will defeat 6.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|uni_dennis: other room 4@sX|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  Here is the time to strike back for the US|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  Are they playing Precision?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|minimeck: I don't believe so, perhaps a weak nt or something along those lines|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|minimeck: in any case 1@h seems an interesting choice :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ctuncok:  could it be xfer responses?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Good stop by Drodge, nonetheless|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  2 IMPs for the US|pg||
nt|minimeck: That would make more sense Cenk, transfer responses not very popular with americans but i think these two like their gadgets|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ctuncok:  there is a chance he might score this perhaps|pg||
nt|ctuncok:  for a 6 imp pickup|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is certainly makable, at the other table declarer attempted to both ruff the 3d diamond and the long club, allowed west to score a 4th trump|pg||
nt|minimeck: Can simply give up on that and establish the spade if so desired |pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Only needs to lose 3@H and a @S|pg||
nt|ctuncok:  if he risks the 3rd trumps drawn and rely on favorable spades, he will succeed|pg||

pc|h9|nt|minimeck: One aspect of viewgraph that we cannot interpret, is how fast the players play to a trick, oftentimes affects a guess such as that|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|minimeck: can now crossrough for the extra undertrick|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|minimeck: but needed the duck|pg||
nt|minimeck: After going up king there, certainly planning to play all 3 rounds of trump|pg||
nt|ctuncok:  2 rounds of spades allow them toe score a club ruff or a uppercut at any rate. he had to attack trumps at trick 2 to have any shot i think|pg||

nt|malipivo:  as I see slams everywhere, this must be one of them|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a spade and a diamond loser is there|pg||
mb|2N|nt|malipivo:  There is many of you, I am just one (even weighting 250 pounds, 115 kg). With the help of Dealer's will I won't make many mistakes today. :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  China currently standing 2nd (140 VPs), Costa Rica currently standing 19th (55 VPs).|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  this doesn't look like he can get 8 tricks. Let's see how lotan tackles this|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|hackenbush: down 2 at least|pg||
nt|malipivo:  My morning praying for slams is fulfulling as there is our second.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If interested, my today's morning kicker is (Gothic music; The Gathering: Mandylion): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYBu10QBut0|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 3@d a Bergen Raise, but CC doesn't say how strong, 10-11 presumably|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|johnjones:  NS missed game for +170 only, so this will be the first real blood of the match!!!|pg||

mb|4H|nt|malipivo:  We are in the middle stage of the round robin playing 16 boards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  defence was considering sacrificing, but not today|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Juniors, round 8, according to this plan:|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  A typical pushy vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  a trump will be the best lead for the defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|johnjones:  True, but the layout looks friendly enough for both 4H and 3NT to work.  |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hop avoided the @c lead, so will go 1 off|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||

nt|johnjones:  Against that, Lee will to well to go down 2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They went down in 4@h in the Open Room.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  Declarer lead trumps too early forgetting his only chance: clubs.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|uni_dennis: 4@sX -1 on bd 2, so 7 imps back to Netherlands|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d2|pg||

pc|cA|nt|hackenbush: heading towards 3 down, if NS collects the @dK|pg||

nt|malipivo:  What a nice slam morning we are having!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: curious bidding at the other table, where North cue-bid six diamonds, got six spades from partner and bid seven anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  good morning|pg||
nt|dburn: but it makes sense - since partner did not bid six hearts, maybe everything he had was in clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results for all three series here:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  England currently standing 3rd, Poland currently standing 4th. We are watching Youngsters.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not going to be so easy for England after North opened with an artificial bid instead of a natural one|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is not risking and passes.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 7.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If passing this, 2 imps to China.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is risky as game may be missed on some 10-11 HCPs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not that I blame him|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We see 6 fast winners and some will be done for the 7th.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *work|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it might be interesting to see 3!n E-W losing only 4 aces|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sAJ were onside, @dJ as well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, it is a theory|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3 tens on this board were helping a lot|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and 3 nines as well|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  likely that brazil will be in 3nt on board 4, after all they do have 26hp|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kiwibridge: I don't like 6 card suits in 1NT so it always pleases me when it gets punished|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse is possible in clubs, but there is not enough transportation.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|keylime:  I always have a good feeling when after pard opens a 1 bid, I have possibly more points than them. There's a certain comfort that goes with it.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  running scores on http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  7@d may force N-S to 7@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West didn't buy it and didn't cover with queen.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|johnjones:  The Swedes appear to be playing that 3C would be a high level reverse and show extras.  That is a very sensible agreement.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Other table had a very lengthy, relay auction to the excellent contract of 6@d.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|johnjones:  He had a Precison 2C bid available - it would have worked better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  EW clearly play very constructive preempts|pg||
pc|c6|nt|keylime:  I agree; bidding 3@c here if you're a pattern bidder, causes problems due to the room once takes to show a club suit. I myself would rather rebid 2@h as a waiting call here then the 3@c bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it might|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: but they'll get some back here|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec messages me they do play 3C as a high level reverse - thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  North's hand should be prime now, and South with four shiny bullets might take a stab at grand here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4-1 diamond break coupled with the heart position hurts the chance for grand here a bit.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A grand is excellent without a trump lead, but iffy with a trump lead|pg||
nt|keylime:  You'd need entries, which at 7 on a trump lead becomes perilous.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec tells me they choose a natural sequence, but had relays available|pg||
nt|johnjones:  If that is the case, that shows excellent judgement because it put weight on the KD|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we may count a lot of tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe it should have done|pg||
pc|sA|nt|malipivo:  fast winner counting: 1-2 hearts, 6 diamonds and two 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|keylime:  And the T too. Both prime cards here.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|keylime:  Nice natural auction here to a likely push. Well done.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Which might be found with relays, but sometimes relays run out of room to find all exact cards.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially with pinpointing 5-5 hands. The frequencies are not as friendly as the 5431 hands.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I like South's decision to go natural, but think he wimped a little in not bidding the grand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a fair game here, reached after the opening instead of preempt. Needs 3-2 trumps and @hA onside, or some defensive help|pg||
pc|sK|nt|johnjones:  Good point|pg||
nt|keylime:  West has made a nice lead here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer doesn't know clubs are 3-3 and that hearts are not 5-2. So entry management will be important.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|johnjones:  He'll be happy to not lose a trump trick though.|pg||
nt|keylime:  16 board segments for the Youth Teams in the RR.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  without a D lead it will make 5|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|minimeck: Perhaps, East might have shrugged his shoulder and lead a diamond anyway :)|pg||

nt|minimeck: That being said, the judgement wasn't far off, 3nt needed a bit of help, but they do pay a bonus for game :)|pg||

nt|malipivo:  They are having internet connection difficulties at the venue, this may happen.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|dburn: Poland clearly have a game plan - overcall 4@d on every hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|malipivo:  We shall see what level of risk they are taking.|pg||

mb|p|nt|hackenbush: treacherous 4@h here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, board 5: they are in 1!nN.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|malipivo:  5@s might be on as double finessing in clubs is working|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  They got an overtrick there so tied after 5. This room is two boards behind now; how much time are they allocated - 8.5 min/board?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: SRY,the network is too poor.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 8 imps for israel on bd 5 as 2@c went 3 off|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Possible 8-imp swing coming.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  any voters for slam?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|johnjones:  On a lucky day 4H might make an overtrick, but not today.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This would be a risky one, but we may expect to see it at some tables.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|uni_dennis: in the open room padon made a take-out dbl over 3@d lifting NS to 4@d, but that was still an easy make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|malipivo:  On this deal a low heart from West to @hT is working.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|malipivo:  A diamond lead wouldn't be nice as it also kills one transport to West hand.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Another sensible decision by North this time.  The H values aren't working, so he stayed off a direct raise.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So nice bids here|pg||
nt|keylime:  Their teammates going two off red in the other room, makes this important to make +140 to cover some of the loss.|pg||
nt|keylime:  In the other room, South overcalled a strong NT with a multi 2@d overcall, which drove W/E into 3NT.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The other room was down 2 in 3NT, which definately doesn't get the "sensible" award, although Multi is tough to deal with|pg||
nt|keylime:  Ten tricks are available here for South. The heart will jettison a club and the K@s is in the slot.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect that N/S in the other room maybe playing Multi-Landy or something similar.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|johnjones:  For American  (ACBL) spectators, there is no written defense allowed in this competition|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|nt|malipivo:  South might bid 4@d, just to say he is having support, leading from KJT is not easy.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c3|nt|keylime:  That's right, so unlike here in the US, where certain items played permit the opponents of that treatment to have written defenses, on site it is all in the brain.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|keylime:  There was a hand a few years ago, if memory serves Freeman-Nickwell were defending against the Multi 2@d opening. They had 15 pages (!) of notes for the Multi they were allowed to use to get to an excellent slam.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|malipivo:  From our perspective it is easy to see everything.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: It helps when you have everything in writing. Pathetic|pg||
nt|keylime:  And Roland, in our mid-chart events, we can play any defense over 1NT, without any disclosed defenses.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The ACBL is ridiculous in its treatment of Multi defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Outside the US you have to remember stuff. We call bridge a mind game|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|keylime:  Yet, xfers over natural 1 club opening demand a written defense, and that is a lot easier to cope with.|pg||

nt|keylime:  The natual 1@c with xfer responses.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Why aren't we moving here - South is good|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|malipivo:  Poland has crossed 42-imp difference, so at the moment it is 25-4 VP.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  @sK is offside, but diamonds may be developed fast enought if played from South hand.|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|keylime:  RR1 results saw the home team, Israel, Netherlands, and both USA teams score heavily in the VP column.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: DBL take-out|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NS escaped the DBL in the open room as W rebid 2@c, so 3NT EW there|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 14 and 12 I am told|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The USBF site doesn't say, but they are young and look even younger in person.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Richard Jeng became a Life Master at the age of 10 in 2010!|pg||

nt|johnjones:  sneaky|pg||
nt|johnjones:  he may have wanted to set the Cs up for tricks though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the other room Padon responded 1@s, then supported @c before bidding 3NT, so @d6 lead there|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|malipivo:  OR, a diamond lead.|pg||

nt|johnjones:  He'll be OK since the HK is a reentry |pg||

nt|malipivo:  He might go down even in 3@s.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h3|nt|uni_dennis: building his 9th trick in @c here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So swing is coming as they shall make it.|pg||

mb|4D|nt|malipivo:  Neither the Czech Republic nor Slovakia teams are presented at this tournament, so I am crossing my fingers to all the teams. :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|johnjones:  We have a football score.  6-3 one field goal to two field goals.|pg||

mb|p|nt|johnjones:  A quick down 1|pg||
nt|dburn: here, you would like it if North had a real negative available|pg||
nt|malipivo:  23-7 VPs in favor of China|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and still living opportunity for a swing on this deal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West could bid hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  That's exactly what East needs from him.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Reopening is kind of risky with useless @sQ and 1=4=4=4 distribution.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now East thinks that partner isn't having 4 hearts, it is dangerous thought.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: hi|pg||
mb|5C|nt|gronkvist:  Dbl showed 4+@s and 1@s showed 2-3 @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In a balanced 11-13?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS opens all bal hand 12-14/18-19 with 1@c and then play trf and relays after that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke is usually North and Ida South, right Johan?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This sequence will probably ends in 3@d or 3@h.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room in 4@h, but I am afraid it is going down.|pg||
nt|dburn: but 4@c is... well, it is not clear that it is even a cue bid|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is just happy he is having strong hand, who wouldn't be? |pg||
nt|dburn: and even if it is, Huber should not be looking at a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 5@d doomed on a @s lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3-imp difference, 16-14 in favor of Argentina|pg||

mc|10|nt|johnjones:  Declarer can now afford to duck a spade for communication.  That wouldn't have been possible on  a trump lead.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer will need to be in the moment here and play carefully for the slam. It's easy to let excitement as a well bid hand get to best of you.|pg||

nt|keylime:  Very good lead. Declarer does not have that friendly of splits here, and cards are not well placed either.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  3NT is also an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sort of auctions there's not a lot of point leading @s as partner didn't raise and RHO surely has a robust stopper|pg||
pc|s2|nt|keylime:  Probably a result of the slam; the need to bid a close game to get imps back.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 13 top tricks here in @h, @c and NT|pg||
nt|cicus: it is not clear how NS can come to 11 tricks in spades here|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  playing @dT has its advantage on this deal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  diamonds could provide discard for that club|pg||

pc|cK|pg||

pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Unbalanced 4-card supp for spades|pg||

nt|Walddk2: With a balanced hand and 4-c support they go through 2@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|johnjones:  Thank you|pg||
