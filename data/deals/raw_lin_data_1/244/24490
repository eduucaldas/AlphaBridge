mb|4D|nt|johnjones:  NS missed game for +170 only, so this will be the first real blood of the match!!!|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results and running scores for all three series here:|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  True, but the layout looks friendly enough for both 4H and 3NT to work.  |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hop avoided the @c lead, so will go 1 off|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h is a fine contract for the other side, diamonds providing winners fro a club discard|pg||
nt|minimeck: North very well might take the plunge here, not the best shape however|pg||
mb|4S|nt|malipivo:  Three suits double stopped.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rzecz nie w wicie lecz w licytacji w poprzednim rozdaniu|pg||
nt|minimeck: a narrow target shooting for -500 |pg||
nt|minimeck: :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theory, 4@s is going down 3, let's see if they find it.|pg||

mb|p|nt|johnjones:  with the CA wrong, down 1 looks likely|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'd expect a game too many versus a game too few from the juniors.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: lub cos:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: will normally make this, but he can go wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Against that, Lee will to well to go down 2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They went down in 4@h in the Open Room.|pg||

nt|kluk: wyglada na 11 lew|pg||
nt|kluk: przepraszam 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Declarer lead trumps too early forgetting his only chance: clubs.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Personally, I dont particularly like the odds of 4@s, his 3@s bid allready showed his hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: winning 3 imps versus losing a bunch if 4@h was not making, need to be pretty sure :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The risk is that 500/800 points are there for sure, 4@h might still have a chance to get beaten.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|uni_dennis: 4@sX -1 on bd 2, so 7 imps back to Netherlands|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, 4@sN, @hK lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If North would have three diamonds and two clubs, there is one possible ruff.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  Board 2 is a 12-imp victory for France.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the endgame, they developed them, but it was too late.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nasze i tak podwi³y liczbê impów w stosunku do pierwszego meczu|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: podwoi³y|pg||
nt|z_lasu: tutaj spory pech ze kiery 3-3 bo by bylo tylko 8 lew na bez atu, a w piki koncowka by szla|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale nasze te¿ graj¹ 3 BA wiêc o pechu nie mo¿emy mówiæ|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if he decides to take a @h finesse for example|pg||
nt|frankaus: prob duck @c in presumed safe (w) hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: IF he had not do that,the contract was "make"|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: playing on @c will get him home indeed with 2@s, 3@h, 1@d, 3@c |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: AJx kier jest przed kierami, wiec w zasadzie nic sie wielkiego nie dzieje|pg||
pc|s5|nt|uni_dennis: now no @c9 so duck to W|pg||
pc|s8|nt|johnjones:  Anything but a C now and declarer is sunk|pg||
nt|keylime:  I can't see North breaking open what appears to him/her as a half-frozen suit.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: i dubel trrefl przy dublu kier, wiec nawet nie da sie przebic :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: @c9 would undo decl plan|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As we see, spades are 2-2, the third spade in South hand would be there waiting.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|hackenbush: heading towards 3 down, if NS collects the @dK|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A D shift at trick 2 would have left the defense better placed|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|lukasz1982: i teraz juz 11 :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|johnjones:  Even then, declarer would probably go wrong.  Grant Baze used to teach to guess the leader for the Ace in a premature underlead situation.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|uni_dennis: claim now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Some people tend not to bid after !n opening, but North is "under hammer".|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot it in spades at least (finessing @sK is on).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, 4@sXE.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|uni_dennis: but het guesses right here in letting them play 4@h|pg||

pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  West holding 4 hcps has no use for East, but 5 spades does.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The defense appears to have 5 D and 2 S before declarer can get in|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even a low heart lead gives up a trick: @hT is above @hJ.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Or rather below.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|malipivo:  Our attention goes to diamonds, which is crucial on this deal.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|malipivo:  Heart continuation is expected here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is getting endplayed in two suits.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  even ducking is not stopping declarer from making (double dummy)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but getting him to trouble|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: aj, jednak nie od lewy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|keylime:  Might be able to arrange an endplay here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even after @dT9 East is covering and securing a trick in diamond suit.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s7|nt|malipivo:  if North covers, declarer has to play @dQ and discard a club|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and ruff a club|pg||
nt|malipivo:  To be able to get back to hand for last round of finesse.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  now 8@h is blocking the suit and he might be forced to do that anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  spades are no longer helping as an entry thanks to that duck|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|keylime:  A@c, K@c, club exit. |pg||
nt|malipivo:  There was no inference in bidding, so likely to play @hT.|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|dburn: not going to be so easy for England after North opened with an artificial bid instead of a natural one|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is not risking and passes.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 7.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If passing this, 2 imps to China.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is risky as game may be missed on some 10-11 HCPs.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: convention cards of all pairs are here: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/wbf/2012YouthTaicang/default.asp|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not that I blame him|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We see 6 fast winners and some will be done for the 7th.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *work|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it might be interesting to see 3!n E-W losing only 4 aces|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sAJ were onside, @dJ as well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, it is a theory|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3 tens on this board were helping a lot|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and 3 nines as well|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  likely that brazil will be in 3nt on board 4, after all they do have 26hp|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: zdecydowanie tak|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Some days we will be in 4@s making, but today is not the day.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Some multi gadgetry here, european players likely to be more familiar with the followups :) |pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are losing 2 spades a diamond and maybe a club.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Some kind of pass or correct with preference to hearts i suppose|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: I don't like 6 card suits in 1NT so it always pleases me when it gets punished|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse is possible in clubs, but there is not enough transportation.|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  7@d may force N-S to 7@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West didn't buy it and didn't cover with queen.|pg||
nt|minimeck: or a game try for either major it seems |pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's hope defence will cash their club winner.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|uni_dennis: 3@h GF 5-5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason is that hearts are providing enough winners for club discards.|pg||
nt|minimeck: will still be ok, with east only having 2h :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|johnjones:  The Swedes appear to be playing that 3C would be a high level reverse and show extras.  That is a very sensible agreement.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Other table had a very lengthy, relay auction to the excellent contract of 6@d.|pg||
nt|kania12:  trzeba liczyc na pomoc|pg||
pc|h6|nt|johnjones:  He had a Precison 2C bid available - it would have worked better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  EW clearly play very constructive preempts|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: jednak raczej nie bedzie zapisu dla nas|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|keylime:  I agree; bidding 3@c here if you're a pattern bidder, causes problems due to the room once takes to show a club suit. I myself would rather rebid 2@h as a waiting call here then the 3@c bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it might|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: but they'll get some back here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with 5-4 they bid 2@C first and then Smolen (2@c-2@D//3@h as 5@S-4@h and 3@s as 5@h-4@s)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@s doesn't seem right to me. E has a good hand for slam|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|johnjones:  A spec messages me they do play 3C as a high level reverse - thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  North's hand should be prime now, and South with four shiny bullets might take a stab at grand here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4-1 diamond break coupled with the heart position hurts the chance for grand here a bit.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A grand is excellent without a trump lead, but iffy with a trump lead|pg||
nt|keylime:  You'd need entries, which at 7 on a trump lead becomes perilous.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec tells me they choose a natural sequence, but had relays available|pg||
nt|johnjones:  If that is the case, that shows excellent judgement because it put weight on the KD|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we may count a lot of tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe it should have done|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if W had a singleton @c you only need to find @hQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|malipivo:  fast winner counting: 1-2 hearts, 6 diamonds and two 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he will try it anyway|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|keylime:  And the T too. Both prime cards here.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|keylime:  Nice natural auction here to a likely push. Well done.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Which might be found with relays, but sometimes relays run out of room to find all exact cards.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially with pinpointing 5-5 hands. The frequencies are not as friendly as the 5431 hands.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I like South's decision to go natural, but think he wimped a little in not bidding the grand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a fair game here, reached after the opening instead of preempt. Needs 3-2 trumps and @hA onside, or some defensive help|pg||
pc|c6|nt|johnjones:  Good point|pg||
nt|keylime:  West has made a nice lead here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer doesn't know clubs are 3-3 and that hearts are not 5-2. So entry management will be important.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Another opportunity was to steal a club winner: leading a low club from North and hoping that ace won't be played at first round.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defence is ducking from time to time to get more information/signals from partner.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|johnjones:  He'll be happy to not lose a trump trick though.|pg||
nt|keylime:  16 board segments for the Youth Teams in the RR.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|keylime:  Playing under Cat 3 of the WBF regs, so no Brown Stickers or HUMs (Highly Unusual Methods).|pg||
pc|s8|nt|malipivo:  and one more heart to the Polish team|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: znou cos/kto wisi?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is no entry in South's hand, so squeeze against East looks impossible.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|dburn: Poland clearly have a game plan - overcall 4@d on every hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 7@s and 7@c both very good contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We shall see what level of risk they are taking.|pg||
nt|dburn: seems to be working well so far|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@C their only strong opening|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hackenbush: treacherous 4@h here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, board 5: they are in 1!nN.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  5@s might be on as double finessing in clubs is working|pg||
nt|kluk: Mam nadzieje:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 6@d will be 4 off only|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@C only contains strong hands, so pass on 5@d and now on 6@d will be forcing|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but think they haven't discussed this very much|pg||
mb|1N|nt|keylime:  They got an overtrick there so tied after 5. This room is two boards behind now; how much time are they allocated - 8.5 min/board?|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: would pass or DBL on 5@d show interest to play something|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: pass on 6@d shows a hand to play (dbl would be penalty, usually BAL, semi-bal)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: although pass on 6@D will show interest in bidding, i don't know if Westerbeek thinks his @s 8xxx is enough to do so|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Scoreboard shows -1, it means that operator might get lost the actual play.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzjy: SRY,the network is too poor.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 8 imps for israel on bd 5 as 2@c went 3 off|pg||

nt|malipivo:  any voters for slam?|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: tu sie chyba nic wielkiego nie dzieje - trzeba troche uwazac na komunikacje, ale jest Jx pik jak by co|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|johnjones:  On a lucky day 4H might make an overtrick, but not today.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This would be a risky one, but we may expect to see it at some tables.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|uni_dennis: in the open room padon made a take-out dbl over 3@d lifting NS to 4@d, but that was still an easy make|pg||
nt|minimeck: this hand is certainly quite unfriendly, very well might limit declarer to 3 trumps and two aces|pg||
pc|h7|nt|malipivo:  On this deal a low heart from West to @hT is working.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @s98 are useful cards as trumps might be 4-2 or even worse.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|malipivo:  A diamond lead wouldn't be nice as it also kills one transport to West hand.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|johnjones:  Another sensible decision by North this time.  The H values aren't working, so he stayed off a direct raise.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So nice bids here|pg||
nt|keylime:  Their teammates going two off red in the other room, makes this important to make +140 to cover some of the loss.|pg||
nt|keylime:  In the other room, South overcalled a strong NT with a multi 2@d overcall, which drove W/E into 3NT.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The other room was down 2 in 3NT, which definately doesn't get the "sensible" award, although Multi is tough to deal with|pg||
nt|keylime:  Ten tricks are available here for South. The heart will jettison a club and the K@s is in the slot.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect that N/S in the other room maybe playing Multi-Landy or something similar.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|johnjones:  For American  (ACBL) spectators, there is no written defense allowed in this competition|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  South might bid 4@d, just to say he is having support, leading from KJT is not easy.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: East thought that West might hold a hand with long @hs and W thought/hoped that 6@h would show a good 5-card|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h5|nt|keylime:  That's right, so unlike here in the US, where certain items played permit the opponents of that treatment to have written defenses, on site it is all in the brain.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lukasz1982: @cK nie utrudnil raczej wziecia 10 lew|pg||
pc|h3|nt|keylime:  There was a hand a few years ago, if memory serves Freeman-Nickwell were defending against the Multi 2@d opening. They had 15 pages (!) of notes for the Multi they were allowed to use to get to an excellent slam.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: ale W nie musialamiec J :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It helps when you have everything in writing. Pathetic|pg||
nt|keylime:  And Roland, in our mid-chart events, we can play any defense over 1NT, without any disclosed defenses.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The ACBL is ridiculous in its treatment of Multi defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Outside the US you have to remember stuff. We call bridge a mind game|pg||
pc|d4|nt|uni_dennis: but in a way strange by W. he wanted to play 6@s opposite some fit, but now E bids 6@h he believes it can only show a good suit|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|keylime:  Yet, xfers over natural 1 club opening demand a written defense, and that is a lot easier to cope with.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: if W didn't bid 3@D here he would be on lead against 3NT likely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: you are watching match 16|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the round robin consists of 19 matches|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@s would go down if defence cash their @h+@c winners.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 8.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but NS will get to 5@c now|pg||

mb|d|nt|malipivo:  Poland has crossed 42-imp difference, so at the moment it is 25-4 VP.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 2 extra rounds of trump might tell him something|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: not sure why North at the other table responded 1NT to 1@d, especially since in Polish style 1@d always shows at least four|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Richard Jeng became a Life Master at the age of 10 in 2010!|pg||

mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: If W opens they are likely to end up in a game|pg||

mb|4H|nt|malipivo:  Second diamond loser can be discarded via ruffing or via developed clubs.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: and now S hopes they did wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like they will reach a thin 3nt|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theory a spade loser might get away on club winners if spades aren't attack first.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Club ruffing is not going to work for defence as South is also singleton in clubs.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: defense can now set up a @s before @ds are good, but might just lose 1@s 1@h 1@d|pg||

nt|MolvaM: east must double that|pg||
pc|c4|nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 7, N-S are bidding aggresively and buying 3!n.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  This is risky line.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The battle for overtricks is over.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|johnjones:  He'll be OK since the HK is a reentry |pg||
nt|malipivo:  It may lead to an ovetrick in OR and an imp to England.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He might go down even in 3@s.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: first seat opener no matter how light should take 1-2 tricks normally|pg||
pc|d4|nt|uni_dennis: building his 9th trick in @c here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So swing is coming as they shall make it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: SO the board 7 has translated +1|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a diamond means a lot of trouble for declarer.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: he clearly is convinced trumps break 5-0, not strange with 4th best lead and @d 4-2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|malipivo:  He would save a heart loser but losing trump control.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|johnjones:  The 5-4 heart fit looks better than the 5-3 spade fit, but the result will be the same.|pg||

mb|3N!|nt|chasetb:  Hi all - 3@D is Game Forcing mini-splinter.  It doesn't promise Diamonds, but in this case that's his short suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  Okay, I thought it was along the lines of a splinter. Too strong for Bergen|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|galallie:  understandably, it looks like NS are bidding to 6|pg||

nt|malipivo:  West could bid hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  That's exactly what East needs from him.|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  NS opens all bal hand 12-14/18-19 with 1@c and then play trf and relays after that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke is usually North and Ida South, right Johan?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This sequence will probably ends in 3@d or 3@h.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NS do not play a strong @c system, so they also start with a strong 2@c (22+)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@D is waiting|pg||
pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room in 4@h, but I am afraid it is going down.|pg||

nt|dburn: East in Closed Room may be of the same mind|pg||
nt|minimeck: Not the worst slam in the world, trumps 3-0 sinks the boat, NS here likely playing limited openings, so south simply bid 4@s with no slam interest opposite an 11-15, many pairs ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: might use jacoby or simmilar and get to 6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason might be that 3 diamonds cannot be ruffed as spades are 3-0.|pg||

nt|cicus: with 8 tricks double is a normal start for West|pg||
nt|cicus: only, he does not have 8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he doesn't know about that|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd bid up to 3@S I admit|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: another way to end up in 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  any voters for 3!n N-S?|pg||

mb|3D|nt|mrdct: need to hook the @h10 here to make|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and going to 4@h?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: defense can make 1@c, 2@h, 1@D, 1@s and a @c ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: for 1 down|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so good lead|pg||

nt|MolvaM: looks to be on the right track|pg||
nt|minimeck: lol! pavel I hope you would use keycard and find you are missing 1 and the queen of trump|pg||
nt|malipivo:  To be in heart slam is a bad idea missing @hAQ.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|keylime:  Very good bidding. Now, will another trump lead come from West?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|johnjones:  Declarer can now afford to duck a spade for communication.  That wouldn't have been possible on  a trump lead.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer will need to be in the moment here and play carefully for the slam. It's easy to let excitement as a well bid hand get to best of you.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  This will be the first swing in the match that doesn't involve undertricks or overtricks|pg||

mc|11|nt|hackenbush: 3 trumps = 3 control units, in Rodwell's terms, while 3 spades need to be knocked out. And declarer has the lead, so he will come out ahead|pg||

mb|d|mb|p!|nt|coolbeans:  I'm assuming a pass shows only 2 Spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|chasetb:  Neither of you would have tried a 3@H opening here as South?  After all, 6-4, bid one more :)|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  not*|pg||
nt|galallie:  i dont like pre empting at the 2 level with a void|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I think W should have redoubled, to show 2@S with Heart stoppers|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  E can then safely bid 2N|pg||
nt|chasetb:  One kib just said he would bid 3@H, another mentioned 1@H.  You do have 2 quick tricks, but in a 2/1 or similar system, I prefer a little more.  In a Strong Club such as Precision, I wouldn't mind 1@H|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  E now really has no choice but to bid 2@S and hope for the best, but he sure as hell isn't getting the best|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: nie- grano 3 bez jednej|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@c a transfer to 2@D, to play there or any INV|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so wackwitz needs to do more than 2@D if he doesn't want to play there|pg||
nt|minimeck: the pre-empter would typically take one bid unless he has a suprise, which here he does, as 3nt looks a likely make won't be too bad here|pg||

pc|h2|nt|keylime:  2@d would be fourth suit forcing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A risky 6@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They would need a swing of this magnitude.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hi konstatinos|pg||
nt|cicus: W has a nice hand for @Hs so he has to do something other than lazily raising to 4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have some options on this deal: finessing @cK or squeezing South in minor suits.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|johnjones:  We are seeing good judgement and nice card play from 4 youngsters whose combined aged is 62 (younger than many of us).|pg||

pc|d4|nt|johnjones:  Good lead, best declarer can do is -150|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Andy has embarrassment of riches|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sJxx is providing a safety trick for declarer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  An opportunity for Chinese team.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|uni_dennis: westerbeek looking for his best bid: 3@h can be 5, 3@s can be 3, 3N needs better stopper|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|keylime:  Very good lead. Declarer does not have that friendly of splits here, and cards are not well placed either.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  3NT is also an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sort of auctions there's not a lot of point leading @s as partner didn't raise and RHO surely has a robust stopper|pg||
nt|z_lasu: jakies miliony stoja|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tak¹ obronê to nawet 50 lat temu bym nie wymyli³|pg||
pc|dK|nt|keylime:  Probably a result of the slam; the need to bid a close game to get imps back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3rd and 5th leads, also against notrump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: n  missing, my fault  Konstantinos|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: ranges in natural bidding made this a tough hand to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in strong @c after 1@c E has a GF hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think 3C was better than 3d|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: So Micke knows partner has 5|pg||

nt|malipivo:  hm, that's pity|pg||
nt|cicus: apparently not, else he'd have alreay bid 7|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results and running scores for all three series here:|pg||

nt|malipivo:  All three series are playing the same boards, we may compare their results afterwards easily.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|gronkvist:  Bye all have to go|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, it is pity|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cicus: if 5@D showed 3 aces then 5NT was an invitation to grand and @SK should suffice|pg||

pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Thx Johan|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer is going to get squeezed here possibly.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I dislike the both the 2NT and 3NT bids.  Why accept with 12 scattered HCP?  Especially NV!!!|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  Can they find 6NT for 2 IMPs though?|pg||
nt|galallie:  if West had actually phsyched 1nt it would of made it more difficult to find :P|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I still am laughing from Dwyer's 1@S psyche a few days ago when USA 1 played USA 2 in the Junior series|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|coolbeans:  1@S X - 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|galallie:  lose 1 haha|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  3@C is Puppet Stayman|pg||
mb|3N|nt|galallie:  my guess is they will go with 6diamonds if they find the fit since it is imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|galallie:  seems like the safer slam, even though it does have potential to go down if declarer doesnt guess diamonds correctly|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  Interesting choice by N not to bid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  Well, there's only one way to deal with the 4-1 break|pg||

nt|malipivo:  We are watching Youngsters, Poland vs England, at the moment winning 25-4 VPs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 10, they didn't cash those fast winners, so contract made and a major swing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks like.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: an drugim stole nie padla kontra na 2@s...|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  5@d-all pass, so a likely push and a missed opportunity for both teams.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||

nt|minimeck: Now is a time for your slam pavel :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  May I say it? :)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|cicus: tough now - S will have to pass and N?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Permission granted|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Mozart's music for my ears.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Slam is on, dear spectators!|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3@h here a popular treatment, showing 3 spades, singleton heart, and 4/5 either way in the minors, GF|pg||
nt|minimeck: the same bid also exists for 3@s (1-3(4/5))|pg||
nt|minimeck: if partner chooses a minor, you can then bid rkc (kickback) if he bids 3nt, then you can simply bid 4nt or in this case 6nt, or bid gerber|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: in open room bd 11 NS were having a misunderstanding in the bidding, as N passed 2@c |pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n from South would be reasonable now.|pg||
nt|cicus: not on a 5 count|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, that's true|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am too on double dummy.|pg||
nt|cicus: N had an option to bid 2NT right away though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@h opener might let them make 1NT on a @h lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|keylime:  N/S got very high here and paid handsomely.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is cold here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now dealer is testing their bidding to 4@s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but East is to the rescue with DBL|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: depends on what you mean by "opportunity" - against 6@d, West would have had the opportunity to lead a low heart and get a club ruff|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: expect them to land to 3NT here will probably bid 2@s now|pg||
nt|cicus: I think he has too many losers to bid this high|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: lubie 3nt:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: DBL very agressive opposite a NV 3rd hand opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: think 2NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  reopening would be nice from North.|pg||
nt|cicus: 5 losers - partner will raise 4@D with 3 tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but better than all other sorts of 10/11 counts with his QJTx in both @s and @C|pg||
nt|minimeck: Here Siderov chooses to show his 5cd minor and continue in a forcing auction|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Indeed, this treatment is working nicely on this deal.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|keylime:  W/E have an incredibly lucky minor position being 3-3.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2 down probably|pg||

mb|4N|nt|malipivo:  And it is not, well done England!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: need to find the @C ruff to win the board here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT would be off on a @s lead, but 2NT can be made if declarer gets 4@d tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  two tens are helping|pg||
nt|cicus: even 4@D is a stretch when partner could not act over 3@H|pg||

nt|bebechira: kind of choice :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, they were high but not high enought :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|malipivo:  They were down in 5@d and 6@d, so it is strange way of calling it an opportunity (to bid slam).|pg||

nt|malipivo:  I see slams everywhere, I am sorry about that.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a low to @hT and spades back|pg||

nt|tez: 2@h=5 card @s and 5 minor|pg||
nt|tez: if he has minor would bid 2 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: another big result in OR|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@c or 5@d has no play potential, so likely 2!n-pass|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *playing|pg||
nt|malipivo:  or 3@d, we shall see soon enough|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Quite close slam, but it is not there.|pg||

nt|z_lasu: na drugim stole ciekawsza licytacja|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And now a battle for overtricks.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 club is not a very profitable save. goes -500 and might also be 800 if declarer loses control|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrdct: bye all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: bye Dave|pg||
nt|dburn: will have to revise my appraisal - East-West can almost make a slam here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this will make, just losing 1@h, 2@c and 1 or 2 trumps|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: won't go wrong in @s |pg||
nt|tez: ''minors''|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: i can't redeal the 14th|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  sure, after a non-spade lead :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: czy to prawda, ¿e 4@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I am kidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: they can also make a couple of overtricks in 3NT redoubled, which scores more than a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, that's a missed opportunity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@sX would be -3, I guess|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It cannot be more as we see a fast loser in every suit.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hm, declarer is missing entries, he might go down. :(|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Entries are crucial for repeated finesse in spades.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|malipivo:  or more likely 4@hX|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so this time a few imps to the Netherlands|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer has to work hard|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: not quite clear why South decided to double 3NT - I can understand why he might double 6NT, but below that...|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|galallie:  i dont think 4NT is a good idea with 6 clubs and three diamonds, partner could have 2 clubs and 3 diamonds and would pick diamonds|pg||

mb|d|nt|malipivo:  4@h and defence can think about 4@s doubled|pg||
nt|cicus: good partscore for China in OR|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@D weak-2, again only having 5 and a lousy hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results for all three series here:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The slam has its chances with a non-spade lead, but defense prevails them in the Open Room.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|malipivo:  this is also a way|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: so you don't want to be in this slam|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzjy: SOUTH didnit see his hands|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  well, a risk of club lead is obvious|pg||
nt|MolvaM: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  One of the specs reports it's 20-12 if the score holds.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Correction 20-12.|pg||
nt|keylime:  20-10|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but getting to East hand for a club ruff is difficult|pg||
nt|malipivo:  some people treat xxxxx as four card suit|pg||
nt|tez: nearly 5@c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We could see a similar situation yesterday, a bidding side is missing AK in one suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: part score swing|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would prefer to be in 6@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It would have its chances, leading from Axx or Kxx is no beauty for defense.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theoretical 6@d, clubs would get a chance to be developed.|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: znowu kompyter siê zestarza³?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cicus: but when you are relatively weak, raising partner is most important|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@h E-W is making as far as I can see|pg||
pc|h8|nt|uni_dennis: 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: Looks like a very flat board|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, it is|pg||
nt|tez: zanasi why not 1@h?may be pd has 4card @h..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zanasi worried abt suit quality obviously|pg||
nt|tez: ginuus:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but 1@s was wrong|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@s on bd 13 was a(nother) push|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: unless ofcourse South decides to get creative and opens with his 11 count|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: van Lankveld did open 1@h, van den Bos now relaying the hand|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: so this could be a possible swing for Netherlands|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  West didn't get chance declarer to misguess hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  esp. with Txx.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If West would be void in spades, that would be a nice story.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: this is a fundamental mistake. might lose a heart fit if existed. but no problem this hand|pg||

nt|malipivo:  42-imp difference sharp|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So even overtricks play its role.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but critical for singapore (9th) just 1 vp behind denmark|pg||
nt|tez: lucky 6@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: here is a slam on 2 finesses :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks it is not as clubs were protected.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We haven't seen a 3!n contract today, that's little strange.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  That might be a swing to France.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  and it would be a lovely grand North-West|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: and another slam hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 25% chance but today it works|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: some dutch pairs play 1m - 4@c to show this E hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: wackwitz played it with Drijver last year|pg||
mb|1S|nt|johnjones:  back to another well played push board|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 13 top tricks here in @h, @c and NT|pg||
nt|cicus: it is not clear how NS can come to 11 tricks in spades here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@d = 4+@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|malipivo:  playing @dT has its advantage on this deal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  diamonds could provide discard for that club|pg||
nt|cicus: some of the lightest overcalls I have ever seen|pg||
nt|cicus: oh yes but you have to trump 3 clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  be happy you haven't seen mine|pg||
nt|cicus: I can live with any style|pg||
nt|malipivo:  so hearts must be it|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  1@h is a xfer to spades here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  natural, or 12-14 / 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but the opps never leave you alone in the bidding at these colours|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@S denying 3@h|pg||

mb|2C|nt|malipivo:  East lead a low club in the other room.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it solves our mistery|pg||

mb|p|nt|johnjones:  I'm curious what 2NT is used for here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *mystery, my apologies|pg||
nt|cicus: oh I did not notice :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  that overtrick helped a lot in the other room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it might be another imp for China|pg||
nt|cicus: even 10 tricks are not obvious here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but we are not done here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: club finesse first and then @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  and now time for defense|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a heart do @hK, heart back and a heart ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@h asking for a @s cue|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: yes EW are doing a good job disturbing NS|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@d and 3@h natural|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2@s has its chances.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: south should have shown that he has @sA, i think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Over 1@H?|pg||

nt|MolvaM: oh|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Unbalanced 4-card supp for spades|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4333 hand with great intermediates leans South into the 3NT contract on the 9 card major suit fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With a balanced hand and 4-c support they go through 2@D|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: E showing slam interest now|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  From South's view, the hand will be slowly played, hence the lower game contract.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that is careless play|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The spots in clubs is a good news for declarer (@cT9876).|pg||
pc|h2|nt|malipivo:  I am missing @sJ and I am still unaware of spades distribution.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, that's necessity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  as there is no entry to East hand|pg||
nt|cicus: not now as W can pick up spades for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is a lovely textbook example and if it is not, it should be.|pg||
nt|cicus: so infact there are now many ways to make the contract|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: there is one now @S10|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no i rewan¿, choæ nie tak krway siê uda³|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: przynajmniej w planie nie ma|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but 3NT will also make|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: coz, Francuzki wziely delikatny odwet po 23:7|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: ale wlasiciwie to my postanowilismy byc goscinni:)|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: niemniej dalej druga pozycja w tabeli bedize nasza pozycja|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: strata do Holenderek sie powiekszy, a grupa goniaca sie zblizy|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: dzieki wszystkim: Rysiowi Kielczewskiemu, Julianowi Klukowskiemu, MIchalowi Kani, Grzegorzowi Gardynikowi|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: najbli¿sza goni¹ca ma 35 straty|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: interesting 3NT here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in OR @d lead 10 - K|pg||
nt|tez: ty all.enjoyed:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@s a bit too much|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lukasz1982: Wloszki maja juz tylko 15|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: then declarer tried to find his tricks in @h |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with no luck|pg||
pc|c2|nt|malipivo:  And swing coming to England.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cicus: @S(= provides a finessing opportunity|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|cicus: @S87|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: 185 a my 200 na te chwile|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: could make if @hKQ were not wasted|pg||
pc|s4|nt|uni_dennis: EW lead attitude against NT, 2nd from bad suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Next round today starts in 1 hour and 30 minutes according to the BBO plan:|pg||
pc|sK|nt|keylime:  Defense if they have listened can work out a club return|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @D to 10 now, still 1 down |pg||
pc|cK|nt|tez: no dbl no trouble|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|greenhand: safety  play on  diamond  was  the  best  way  to  make  it|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: a jesli chodzi o 4|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: to tak, 35|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so 2 potential swing boards to end the session with|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: he will make 6 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: singleton against KQ is terrible|pg||
pc|c5|nt|uni_dennis: ok, thanks all for watching. we will be back in 1 hour with session 6|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: running scores:|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 7@h bid by NL on 15 in the open room|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and padon bids 7@s over it|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and NS bid 7NT, so 11 imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: it was Vulnerable, so 13 imps even|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lukasz1982: A Francja dzieki temu meczowi weszla do 4|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: defense will probably make 2@C, 1@D and 1 in each Major|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|uni_dennis: if E really played @D6 on the first round declarer can finesse in @d, but unlikely he will|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|keylime:  I want to thank the specs for their help, BBO for the event, and fellow commentators. Signing off for now.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Except for the hand the Jeng's overbid to 3NT, we have watched some pretty good bridge here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  That we have John.|pg||
nt|keylime:  And I think the 3NT was influenced by the club slam.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Yes, although maybe that is a lesson to be learned not to compund your difficulties.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The 6C slam was pretty.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The slam fit their methods well, and the evaluation pivotal.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Some interesting matchups for RR3 coming|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I'm curious how 5D was allowed to make at the other table on this last hand.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Appears that the heart was never allowed to be cashed. Declarer won the trump ace and played a club. Spade return and that's that.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  That would explain it.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Two matches left to finish|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: wiec pewnie jeszcze raz mecz z Francja nas czeka|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|lukasz1982: w playoffach|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cicus: by retaining @S10 for a reentry, W can take now all tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @h now, maybe W will insert the 10, though he shouldn't|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @h to the 9 looks unrealistic|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though you can rule out @hQxxx in E. he would have led that|pg||
pc|c9|nt|malipivo:  and a major swing to China|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: already knows E has 4-4 minors, so long @hs in W likely|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: but it still makes a trick eventually. the worst is singleton against KJ |pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok thanks all hope to see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good evening from taicang|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|malipivo:  congratulations to both teams, great performance it was|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results for all three series here:|pg||

nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|z_lasu: teraz 8 rund gry o nic, bo juz raczej z czworki nie wypadniemy, a najprawdopodobniej takze z dwojki|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: careful defense required and declarer can still make if he finesses in @h|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the end declarer knows E started with @h xx or @h Tx|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West is going to be endplayed.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|s9|pg||
