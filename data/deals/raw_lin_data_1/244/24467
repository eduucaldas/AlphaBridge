nt|liujing: a typical Italian 2@D opening|pg||
pc|d2|nt|toniemme: la difesa visto il morto dovrebbe cercare di limitare le prese di taglio dell'avversario..|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: Anyone in the crowd prefer a negative double rather than 2@C?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am fine with 2@C. Ifwe belong in diamonds, partner will bid them, or if they support to 2@S I can double later|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 3@C a fine spot, but 3@S even finer, both sides can take 9 tricks |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: This unfortunately is too high as they have 4 top losers once the A@S is knocked out, assuming they can find them all of course|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Hard to fault them, it feels like a great fit, but the @Ds will doom them|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bridgegoth: Looks like 2@D was a lead directing raise to 2@S, if so, very nice job by South to get North off to the right lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good save against 3@S as long as it's not doubled|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Yes, unclear what would have happened over 3@H, this still might make if they slip on defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would have been better for Wang to support spades right away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For a start it prevents 2@H by West|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Yes, however with 4@H making in the other room, possible big swing here if S switches to a @S, however, that should be very clear |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: South played @S4 followed by the 10|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Maybe she meant that as a suit preference for diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|bridgegoth: contract is doomed now and it looks like 13 to China|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which it probably should be once South had supported. She can hardly have a doubleton spade|pg||
