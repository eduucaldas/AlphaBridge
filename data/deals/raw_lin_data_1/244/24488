pc|h5|nt|malipivo:  3@c looked as a fine contract.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  I am happy to say: a slam zone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  well, 2@s would be on if it stays this way|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 10: 2 imps at stake as 2 overtricks mean 60 points. Players scored maximum in this room.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In a possible heart slam, defence must cash diamonds soon, as spade finesse (@sT) and also double finesse in clubs (@cQJ) provide enough winners to discard a @d6. Otherwise it would be 6@h+1.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But this is a theory.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's think about 7@dX N-S, how many tricks it would go down?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: Australia need something now|pg||
nt|toniemme: il 3@D di nord mette sassolini sulla strada licitativa delle nostra..nell'altra sala il barrage dxi passo non ha sortito effetti..|pg||
pc|h3|nt|toniemme: non facile per west passare..vero che p non ha fatto cue bid..ma basterebbe avesse picche decenti perché slam non sia disprezzabile..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@C usually 5-5 already, so supporting @c looks best|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If E-W would attack diamonds at every opportunity, @cT might score the 5th trick for defence.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, E-W in 6@h.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: well, if the dutch juniors don't bid it, it will be a bad contract indeed :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, undoubled :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  they have at least one trick in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@hX on bd 10: @d lead, @s switch, now declarer has a chance to ruff 3@D in dummy|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@hN would be -9, 900, 5@cX -4 for 1100|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Nicely stopped at 4th level.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|STRIK3R: that endplay is given that North play @d finesse and finding KJ double in east before endplaying East on K of @s, possible to do, but not given|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|malipivo:  from spec: During this set, it seems that playing with to much relays makes it hard to remember, two big bidding missunderstandings in the other room.|pg||
