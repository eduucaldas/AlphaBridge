mb|p|nt|malipivo:  well, 2@s would be on if it stays this way|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 10: 2 imps at stake as 2 overtricks mean 60 points. Players scored maximum in this room.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In a possible heart slam, defence must cash diamonds soon, as spade finesse (@sT) and also double finesse in clubs (@cQJ) provide enough winners to discard a @d6. Otherwise it would be 6@h+1.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But this is a theory.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's think about 7@dX N-S, how many tricks it would go down?|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 3@C usually 5-5 already, so supporting @c looks best|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: well, if the dutch juniors don't bid it, it will be a bad contract indeed :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, undoubled :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  they have at least one trick in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@hX on bd 10: @d lead, @s switch, now declarer has a chance to ruff 3@D in dummy|pg||
