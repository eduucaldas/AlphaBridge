nt|athene: good low-hcp 3nt; 100% secure on any lead and any lie|pg||
nt|athene: yes it shows the power of a long suit with quick tricks outside|pg||
nt|athene: NS don't have a single point wasted in fact|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Duboin is wondering which major to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time 4 @s is anly 300 but you lose in a long run if you bid those -because in all cases ns aren't aware what they do and 3nt can go down|pg||
nt|athene: yes i don't think EW can reasonably contemplate a sacrifice|pg||

nt|runnerup:  vulnerability is bad so north has about cards to expect by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|gsper:  So 4@S is a good save, but unlikely to be found now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: no chance here of course|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you just play spades and accept two down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double is more flexible, as they say|pg||

nt|nilsland:  It is easy when you see all the cards :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a double for takeout by north if available would have worked well|pg||

nt|gsper:  N might have doubled 2@D, but with both opponents showing cards, and vul, it was not very attractive|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H finesse and can make. 6@H+1@S+2@D+1@C=10|pg||

nt|runnerup:  +100 with best lead -@h possible but  50 now --140 for ns looks odds on in @s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: even with this nice start, and trumps 3-3, declarer should be one down|pg||
nt|athene: east just holds up in spades and there is nowhere to put the @D109|pg||

nt|athene: sometimes that sort of thing is useful but here even if it worked, it would not help especially|pg||
nt|athene: even if clubs break you get 2 hearts, 4 clubs, spade...that's not 3NT by a fair way|pg||

mb|p|nt|gsper:  Transfer, of course. E was doing the thinking|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|fabsayc: i prefer 2@C for that purpose, as partner can bid 2@D with no preference|pg||
nt|athene: interesting, he doesn't go 4@H|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt ew here and if something /else ) happens -it is a suprice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with opening 4@H is that if opps bid 4@S or 5@C over it, as they very likely will, you are left not knowing what to do|pg||
nt|athene: you would probably be tempted to bid 5@D as partner will never imagine what you have|pg||

nt|baardolav: 2@c both majors I belive|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@S constructive - surprised S didnt make an advance towards game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s requests 2NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: there's a saying : 65 come alive how about 75 ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@d transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot of 11's are opened these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: however, the way it has gone, he has hardly shown his hand either|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this auction would show extras for me, and for sure that double was penalty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: twice armed is he, etc|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@H transfer to @S and 2@S for @S check. Am I right?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @s proposed and i would like that too -1. round bid --now ew came in bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems so|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gsper:  Surely|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: 3@D is hearts and 3@S is a super-accept, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D retransfer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello CK and wlc.|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think just bidding 4 right away with north is reasonable|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not see how South can know what is useful and what is not.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might have a club slam opposite suitable cards, but it's shooting for the moon a bit - 3NT is practical |pg||
nt|athene: might be 4@H or 4@D for them|pg||
nt|tez: @h dönüþü dýþýndakiler kayýp|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: on a club attack declarer might have to overtake in spades to get a fast pitch from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know what the redouble was|pg||
nt|athene: and i can't believe angelini did either|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: maybe if the auction had tempoed out differently he would have bid - for example if west made some raise and then east bid 4@S and that was passed round to him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if the @s10 forces the king the defence would need an immediate diamond switch|pg||
nt|athene: so losing one heart, one diamond, and one club|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks like -1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: perhaps being NV was a factor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let's hope we are guessing well|pg||
nt|athene: on any other lead he can happily unblock the @SK as he has time to build an entry to his @SAQ, so plus one|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Rashed & Goran|pg||

nt|queequeg: Closed Room: http://td.bboitalia.it/28.jpg|pg||
nt|nilsland:  East has a minor suit card too little to be stripped|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe but could be some fantoni magic|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: another problem on defense for west, succeeds if he clears the spades, but also must unguard the diamonds later|pg||
nt|athene: but as it went, bidding 5@D in front of his partner is a bit of a gamble|pg||
nt|athene: of course, passing is a big gamble too|pg||

nt|kemperg: @Ss must do it|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 10-13, 5+@d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|athene: same sort of bidding problem for south here as faced north a moment ago over the 2@C opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sort of like a strong weak two|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni-nunes 2-level bids do give their opponents some hard decisions|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: holaa|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting any higher would not be advisable|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: common expert treatment is 1NT on N hand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a string weak two is presumably a bit weaker than a weak strong two|pg||
nt|athene: or a bit weaker than a rope weak two i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: interesting decision for north there|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3nt should be down even after a spade lead?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: lanzarotti obviously takes 2@S as showing a very weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: the immediate bid after the redouble|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems like a heart would have been killing|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H lead for 2 down, but now it has a chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it can make|pg||
nt|kemperg: will get the @Ds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: I guess N could double 3@d with a good(ish) hand |pg||
nt|athene: you might say "well, obviously north must be broke, after the opponents have both shown decent hands"|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be a bit worried here; only 8 obvious tricks even with the club finesse working|pg||
nt|psyck: I like dbl of the options|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C just makes but 3@S could be for -500|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cc does not cover this auction, anybody know what 3@C is?|pg||
nt|queequeg: Open Room http://td.bboitalia.it/30.jpg|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will Sementa lead a low heart or the J :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about this - 2@c may be Gazzilli |pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS are too balanced, but it's hard for either side to realise this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzers (some of them) say 3@C asks for 4 card major or 5 card minor, 3d denies|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not many pairs include 5-card majors in the weak NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since i got at least 4 versions i am more confused than before :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe the have no choice with less than 14 pts|pg||
nt|baardolav: A endplay in @d / @h probably?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: @c queen is a nice card but not shown|pg||
nt|athene: well, no 4@C, so madala knows they are off the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: they'll play six, though, i would think|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2NT said he liked clubs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: 5@D might make|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have a great hand for clubs in that context|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: oh well :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@h not very good needs @C 32 and king rigth most times|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, if you work out what partner has by trusting your opponents, then you get talked out of games when west has psyched the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: beautiful venue indeed|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: but the spades are blocked so he can play on diamonds successfully|pg||
nt|athene: i think if 5@C was there, west would have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did E se 4@C as foricng?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: need to be cautious    even 5 level could be too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody ever won at bridge by trusting the opponents|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't think Sementa would compete to 3 level with a 4333 hand, but it works fine here|pg||
nt|baardolav: he can raise the diamonds yes... because versace do now have any spades left|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: so having agreements with partner is a better way to go, what with him being on your side|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time.....|pg||
nt|athene: south can see declarer is all set to throw hearts on spades, so might as well attack hearts now?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C obviously something showing a good hand, maybe showing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on;y blocked if he wins this :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing king looks the odds play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: lead was @S9 showing bad suit|pg||
nt|athene: and if it was lauria who had the spades, he would have let versace win the first diamond to clear the suit surely|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning|pg||

nt|mdgraham: there is no joy  in Mudville....|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: in fact will have to play carefully       may go down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wonder if the @S4 had any significance|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he decided the only way to beat was partner having the @CA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for non baseball fans, that refers to a famous poem|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and a wasted @SQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|athene: if trumps are clubs are 3-2, you don't need the @CK right, do you? just lose club, ruff clubs good|pg||
nt|athene: *if trumps AND clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|athene: because you can cash clubs and get the heart through as well|pg||
nt|athene: partner having the @HK is not in itself enough; even if you cash some hearts, declarer can throw enough clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H would be interesting|pg||

nt|hedyg:  http://www.federbridge.it/main.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  even 3 @s has good chance -best played by north (so 1. round pass seem too wet -has to be repeated|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see why 4@C should be forcing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: if 2 rounds only drawn   and a diamond finesse   then north can play a heart to south for a club ruff|pg||

nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to ruff a club and pick up trumps, losing just one spade, two diamonds and the @CA|pg||
nt|psyck: to prevent losing 2 trump tricks via @c ruff on a bad day...|pg||
nt|athene: well 3@S can be beaten with diamond ruff and then club shift i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't draw trumps and then get back to dummy fast to throw his club losers on the two good diamonds|pg||

nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
nt|athene: but if west led a spade, east could win the @CA and return a diamond and then throw two clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer could never get to dummy as east could overruff with the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all irrelevant anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or just a club lead|pg||

nt|runnerup:  some 9 in @h ew if opened and will |pg||

mb|1D|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||

nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will pay to stop low here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like a direct 3@D invite, although the bid has several flaws|pg||
nt|psyck: 2C = 10-13 value, 5C-4other unbalanced, or 6+C|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D relay asking for 3-card major|pg||
nt|psyck: N's hand becomes powerful with Aces in pd's suit now|pg||
nt|athene: angelini can't bid less than game now, can he? ace in both partner's suits for a single raise|pg||
nt|athene: transfer responses, so 1@S shows diamonds|pg||
nt|kingcur: a weird deal, that previous one. points 20-20 but with extremely favourable lie of the cards for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  3. hands pass -was a view =suprice also|pg||
nt|kemperg: good 5@D rescue, red against green:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  2NT relay again|pg||
nt|athene: ok, apparently he can|pg||
nt|athene: east might balance now with a double|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last makeble bid NS 2@D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could have responded 2@d, perhaps, but that may be FG, and S isn't quite strong enough for that (non strong-club opener)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry but don't have a CC for NS|pg||
nt|kingcur: so 4@H would have been two off, and 5@C was on ice|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec saw down possibility|pg||
nt|kingcur: except for 3 rounds of hearts, uppercutting West's trump J|pg||
nt|psyck: 3rd @h?|pg||
nt|kemperg: welcome Krishna|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tactical 3 @h to play in 4 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and EW just make 2@S imo|pg||
nt|kingcur: hi Krishna :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: ah a spec suggests north is "she" - i was assuming a different angelini haha|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 now -but ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: everyone has shown his hand fairly, except N who should have bid stronger|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand why west bids spades rather than hearts, but it sure worked out|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is FG|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D response were not GF you might bid a spade anyway so as not to lose the suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2000 |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h showed 3-4 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d showed 1345|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought the redouble might give EW a better chance to find the right major, if west could pass and let east bid spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup:  200 -500 with x|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so north was weaker than i would have been |pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||

nt|kemperg: but who could do that? Zia?|pg||
nt|kingcur: meanwhile we have landed in non-game waters, after 4 boards in a game contract|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: if NS did bid game, east might well bid 5@C, surely?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: just take A and @D K|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: getting to a nice safe 3@D partscore is not trivial really|pg||
nt|athene: also i have no idea what the redouble is all about :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: some specs would|pg||
nt|baardolav: maybe 4@d from north... south could bid 5@d for making, and find a good save for one down|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobholl: made now no problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless your playing flattery|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: but then north feels that facing any sort of heart fit it is worth a shot at game|pg||
nt|athene: run all the diamonds looks reasonable|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so if you pass 3. hand -why bid again ..ofcause souths 2 @s was aggressive also|pg||
nt|psyck: they have some defense, may not be all that clear to bid 5@c, though it is very likely they will bid it as insurance at this vul|pg||
nt|jaapfr: XX and 3@C and 3@D do mean: pls opps go to an unmakebele level:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now semanta must guess spade finesse or more diamonds|pg||
nt|danilo1: next "easy" 3NT ... but with @H wide opened ... after testing @C 3-3 (ending in dummy) ... Sementa may see better chance in @S finess than the risk to loose 3 @D tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he will get it right|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|runnerup:   at least you get + score there -2 aces -and|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what north was worried about - pushing opps into 5@C making - but that is not a big danger when you have two aces and partner opened|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: it looks as though west bid 2@S because he assumed opps would compete further and then he could show hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|runnerup:  norths|pg||
nt|athene: but why is he so anxious to bid 3 over 3?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as you said earlier about 2@S bid|pg||
nt|athene: partner doubled 2@D so you push them up to 3@D and beat them|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W thinks mb @H my pds suit|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kemperg: I think S would have dbl then|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: south either has A,AJ alone in diamonds or AKJx|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zaleski picked up 12 UMPs on bd 4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: a natural line but wont work|pg||
nt|athene: opps might well tell you how to play the spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, they have escaped without a double|pg||
nt|danilo1: he should get it rite ... since with no @DJ, Nunes would probably stay low|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: as far as i can see, declarer had to go after spades, which lie favourably|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  actually a suprice|pg||
nt|jaapfr: could 3@D X -2 (think declarer can end with -1)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@S1@H2@D and 1@C loser|pg||

nt|baardolav: 2down with a stiff  clublead... |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west might go very quietly here, given the vulnerability here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT=20-21|pg||
nt|jaapfr: easy 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  if you are afread of oppenents to make 5 -level with those cards after partner opens and invites -youll never can bid any games |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: south had made a great lead, and should have known every card at the end|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S-1 on hand 4 cost 12 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|athene: perfect mesh here - singleton facing four small - let's see if they can identify it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to locate @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows some sort of good raise and *south* shows extras and a heart singleton, that will certainly do it|pg||
nt|athene: well, with a ten-card fit you don't usually count the queen of trumps as a problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT 12-14; not 5/4 majors or 4441|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D looking for a 5-3 spade fit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, CC not clear about 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3M would be a singleton or void|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead runs to the jack, and declarer will duck a club to north to protect the @SKx i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: if east is thinking this long he must have forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: wake up, fantoni!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, misread the CC. 1NT can include a 4441 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: EW's 1nt has to cover a lot of hands unsuitable for other bids, sort of like a precision 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: their 1-bids are 14+ points and their 2-bids are unbalanced so the weak notrump has to work hard for its living|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, lots of people; no idea about 3@d|pg||
nt|nilsland:  As often - when you take nine you get ten.|pg||
nt|psyck: deal 4, if declarer had 2@s, & 4@d & @cAQJ... 3rd @h could have sold the contract, so was not easy...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobholl: always difficult to rerach a normal 4@S after weak NT|pg||

nt|jaapfr: lovely 1@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: only problem 6@S n/s  is the 3-0 trump split    needs to guess which way to play trumps|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 3@S=at least 5/4 both minors |pg||

mb|1N|nt|ady: this is where west showing a 2 suiter might give the distribution away     vulnerability was against west entering|pg||

pc|cK|nt|athene: i wonder if east had super-accepted, whether south would have bid 3@S|pg||

nt|nilsland:  3@D was 7-9 with 3@S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: but at this vulnerability, that line of thought does not really help so much, because even with a lot of shape, the opponents are not going to be bidding|pg||

nt|athene: gave madala more room to make a try|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult decision for madala|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would play on @D 33|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in positions similar to this, you might want to make the exotic play of ducking the first trick|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you can draw trumps and keep control of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that applied here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: he has virtually no defense to 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although looking at 3@d and 3@S you would guess puppet stayman |pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@c asks for 5M or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart return he will test clubs and then maybe run the @DJ into north for a second avoidance play|pg||
nt|athene: still guarding those spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 3@d denies 5m4M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they should put that on their CC for us poor old commentators :) |pg||
nt|athene: if the defence now play ace and a spade, of course declarer can afford to run the @DJ|pg||
nt|athene: @CQ would have saved a trick; now declarer can lead a heart to the queen then duck a heart and get a club pitch on the @HK|pg||

pc|cT|nt|sharkey: A @C lead will leave the lead in dummy  and -1; otherwise lead will go to hand and make - I predict|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kemperg: 1down on @S play now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: probably expected QJ10 in S, with the 9 in dummy|pg||

nt|athene: looks like a 3nt raise to me|pg||
nt|kemperg: A and Q|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: you mean declarer's natural play is to lead a small trump from whichever hand he finds himself in at trick 2?|pg||
nt|ady: swing could go either way|pg||
nt|athene: i think it is just about 50-50 to be honest|pg||
nt|athene: of course madala is not expecting the @CK to be onside|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's surely below 50%|pg||
nt|athene: he's wondering whether to overtake this, ruff the last heart, then play a small club |pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps 8 now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: oh well, at least he will be happy when he finds the bad break now - it means there is a chance 5@S can gain imps|pg||
nt|gsper:  The low @H showed even number without honor or odd with|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lets say well bid -no real idea if they were aware about possible @c slam -not this time ofcause |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: the defence would then have time to set up a diamond trick but that might be ok|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but in hindsight N does not need so much to make a slam so 3@D better than my 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yukky opening|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C looks about right from west now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how to get their nthin but makeble 3nt as EW?|pg||

nt|athene: of course with trumps 3-2 declarer can just cash @CAK and then ruff the third heart and fourth spade in dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as N i would still think what to bid: pass or 1@H:) your votes pls 1@H or pass?|pg||
nt|kemperg: used to call this a 50% slam, both kings onside or not:)|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|athene: so he is wondering about a 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|athene: 7@H is better than 7NT here i guess as you can ruff the clubs good if need be|pg||
nt|athene: in MP you want to play 7NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=4@s, |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: either the @SK or 480 was wrong, certainly :)|pg||

nt|psyck: didn't expect EW to enter the live auction when vul|pg||
nt|athene: i thought it was a decision between 1@H and 2@H weak jump shift|pg||
nt|danilo1: Can Duboin find @C lead? .. and no @D ... than may be interesting|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 is on, in fact here |pg||
nt|kingcur: :) yeah, that'd make any contract 50%: either it makes, or not|pg||

nt|gsper:  Is there any reason to use the Windows version any longer?|pg||
nt|psyck: guess he will lose a trick in each suit or so|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, there are several reasons to continue using the windows version|pg||
nt|psyck: there are features still missing in the windows version like Chat Log, Chat Room, GIB, Lobby Chat, Text to Voice, etc...but mostly the windows version is what users are used to & ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 22 hcp   with no gret fit   quickly to 3NT?|pg||
nt|sharkey: A 22 point gane - Meckwell style,,,|pg||

mb|4N|nt|sharkey: *game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: kibs agre with yr 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, if you open 11 counts and force to game with 11 counts, you better get used to 22 count games|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ady: I very much doubt  Rod-Meckwell would be in 3NT on this collection|pg||
nt|ady: was 2@C game forcing?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after that we're struggling.....|pg||
nt|tez: zor defans|pg||
nt|psyck: so much more than 50%|pg||
mb|6S|nt|athene: it might look as though declarer only has five losers but if he draws trumps he can't ruff a diamond so he should go one down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@c cue, 5@C Turbo |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so odd number of key-cards and a @c cue|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Turbo is an Italian key-card ask, extremely specialised|pg||

nt|gsper:  Par seems to be 6@DX|pg||
nt|psyck: only 2 red aces to lose in a @h contract|pg||
nt|psyck: since on @c lead, you can discard on @s & W cannot ruff profitably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@H wins on @C lead aswell.|pg||
nt|gsper:  N probably has more defense than partner expects|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: obviously east thinks 4@D is forcing, though, which suggests he thinks it is a "new suit" i.e. 2@C does not guarantee any diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to show it now (gazilli ?)|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||
nt|athene: you might just bid 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: non vul, @h sequence, some shape & values on the side, a clear 3@h bid|pg||

nt|runnerup:  also in 5 . board 5 @c X -100 like expected -over 4 @h  =6 imps|pg||

nt|psridhar:  this Bd shd be a flat @s game making|pg||
nt|kingcur: this will end in 4@S, I presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: only @DA as an obvious loser, as you can throw a diamond on the @SK|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: but if you draw trumps you only have 11 tricks with crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: i think north ought to be raising clubs if her partner can bid them twice|pg||
nt|baardolav: Too conservative not double... I think. you pay 590 one out of 7 times but that is 4 imps only...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, opposite vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt scramble now, perhaps|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW were thoroughly preempted out|pg||
nt|psyck: made it difficult for EW to enter at this vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @D GF?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|runnerup:  not a good start for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 450 modest consolation|pg||
nt|sybarra: or check back of some sort?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: think so|pg||
nt|kemperg: GF chackback I think|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3@S slow arrival now, S having too much for a direct 4@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
nt|danilo1: small @D now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: here come the cues |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: but it still costs an imp |pg||
nt|athene: maybe west comes under pressure, having to guard both majors, and you can ruff the @HK or @S10 good|pg||
nt|gsper:  A D by E risked 4 or 5@C from partner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D was obviously something weird - maybe showed just a minimum hand|pg||
mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: this lead stops 6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  under 6 @c you can stay with good justment|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cant|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: ý have no idea about website|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if declarer plays hearts early   should make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if NS's agreement is that 2nt here is lebensohl or a scramble|pg||
nt|sybarra: not 4 @H?   |pg||
mb|4D!|nt|athene: in italy most doubles suggest a desire to compete further, even after the fit has been found|pg||
nt|tez: 2 nt neymiþ ümit?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@S the end?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you play it as scramble you can use it, like this, to show a weak 3@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: (direct 3@H bid is stronger)|pg||
nt|athene: of course if that is what the double meant then it is easy for south to bid on|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3NT could be non-serious: a hand that has no slam interest unless S is big|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|vugraphzdp: 2nt 3 lü h tutusu|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: 3 cl soruyor|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: 4 d 11 14 d tek |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: one possibility is to run the spades first - that often makes life hard for the defenders|pg||
nt|sharkey: He has to play on @H I think|pg||
nt|athene: i think versace might get trump squeezed|pg||
nt|danilo1: wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: güneydeki oyuncu bu durumda mutlu olmalý sanýrým|pg||
nt|kemperg: and 4@S emphasises that|pg||
nt|kingcur: S would have become more enthusiastic perhaps if N had not shown @D cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: this must be there form of cue bids |pg||
nt|kemperg: for S @SQ instead of @HQ is enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why ace of @H not shown|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe N showed it |pg||
nt|kingcur: so, would we leave it @@4@S with this S hand?|pg||
nt|kemperg: would deny @D controle|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a 4 @C, last train, cue for hts?|pg||
nt|kingcur: I think I would|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will be 2 or 3 down now - good defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no way the defence can set themselves up some long hearts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Pity on the nice defense to miss the second ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now heart best|pg||
nt|nilsland:  up to now ;)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kingcur: if 3NT would show a non-serious hand ánd S has bid a last-train 4@H that got no positive response, then I think 6@S can never be good|pg||
nt|sybarra: so the cues seemed to all be "last train" type |pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: north obviously worried about the weak opening|pg||
nt|athene: but as a dummy for clubs it is pretty good really|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|athene: @HJ suit-preference for diamonds over clubs of course|pg||
nt|danilo1: I do not disagree with @S back by Fantoni ... attacking options since declarer still fears @D overruffs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: north knows his partner has five hearts of course from the 2@D bid|pg||

nt|psridhar:  last board Versace Xed 3@s forcing to game, and Lauria with his Ace could hv doubled too -From Versace pt of view Lauria's X of 4@c may hv been KQX in @c... all murky , nothing is clear |pg||
nt|psridhar:  the info Versace had -to act over 4@s - was 1. pd pre-raised 2. voluntarily bid 4@c 3. did not X 4@s|pg||

nt|gsper:  No 10+ balanced|pg||
nt|athene: north decided that on the bidding, south can't have more than two hearts, and therefore must have three spades :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s 6+S, denies 3+H|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni does not have that many extras now i think|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C-then-3@S shows good spades and about 18+ or so|pg||
nt|athene: but it seems he is giving this a bit of thought|pg||
nt|danilo1: 7@H board may even cost Championship|pg||
nt|psridhar:  now the key card resp will take them to slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead @C from Qxx|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: *view|pg||
nt|kingcur: a lot of @S losers to get rid of here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|ady: then how about 1 spade?|pg||
nt|sharkey: i agree with 1@S |pg||
nt|sharkey: But you probably wont bid game|pg||
nt|ady: 10 hands have taken around 100 minutes|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i can hear the thunder now|pg||
nt|queequeg: yes you right :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5NT was 2 keycards and a void?|pg||
nt|psridhar:  somewhat enterprisiing auction , i cant see a scientific route to slam , may be a relay system, but wd in the end NS|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec confirms|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup:  yes 2 @s is a clear bid -4 @s is -i cant say aloud --and 4 @h was overboard all ready|pg||
nt|kingcur: but having escaped a trump lead gives best prospects for S|pg||
nt|kemperg: no defense left|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to lead trump from qxx |pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, impossible trump lead|pg||
nt|kingcur: I must admit I wouldn't even have considered leading trumps here with that holding...but it would have been the only way to beat this contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: me neither, and also the Italians did not:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does it really beat it? |pg||
nt|kingcur: specs pointing out there is a Bols tip telling me that I should have :)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  no, twi sp losers then and no trump loser|pg||
nt|kemperg: think so, 2nd trump after @SQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3 @S losers|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: but south "bent" a 1nt call on board 1, 3, and 4|pg||
nt|athene: north must have noticed that|pg||
nt|kemperg: quick claim|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i suppose you might misguess spades twice, leading to the 8 then the jack?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: if def pkays 2 trumps, dec only has 2@d & 8 @c tricks|pg||
nt|kingcur: trump lead means no trump trick for defense, but W can lead a 2nd trump when in with @SQ...then no way to make, I think|pg||
nt|adonis18:  sorry, 3 sp losers:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand for a quiz, what would you lead|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Passing with North's hand first time just creates problems later on - as evidenced here|pg||
nt|tez: ortak @h ü alýp @d damý oturturmuþ:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like this switch, add confusion to declarers thinking|pg||
nt|athene: so 2-2 in the majors is not beyond the realms of possibility|pg||
nt|athene: can finesse against any two of @SA, Q, 10|pg||

nt|kingcur: will have to come back to hand with @D ruff net round|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: anyway this is basically why you bid the first time - so you don't have to make a guess later on|pg||
nt|kingcur: and maybe should have previous trick?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kemperg: why wait with @DA?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: the opening 3@C is a matter of style - the two aces and only a 6-card suit are negative factors, but you argue against that |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, you can argue against that|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 3nt oldukça saldýrgan bir deklare|pg||
nt|kingcur: enlighten us then, Krishna :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: if the double shows 4+ spades, then north might want to raise just because of the big fit, but he doesn't want to suggest he has anything|pg||
nt|sybarra: but WHO honestly can lead a club from Qxx??? |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some play transfer to hearts then bid 3nt shows 5 hearts and 4 spades, not forcing|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3-3 now perhaps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the danger here could be the range of the 1NT rebid - no, 2@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would ask where the mirrors are in the room! |pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: @h SPLINTER NOW ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: aggressive from north; if partner has only 3 spades, game will never be there, and even when he has 4, it needs a lot|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D good|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: on last board alfonsin bid 3NT over 2@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win in dummy and lead a diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not obvious that east must split his honours|pg||
nt|danilo1: 50% (or near to that) slam ... good (lucky) choice by Giorgio to bid only 2@S - since @DK unfriendly placed|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Is Easts 4@S a mild slamtry?|pg||
nt|psridhar:  @d lead will scupper this|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  hmm i am out|pg||

nt|MolvaM: önce pas geçip sonra 3nt diyen oyuncuda muhtemeln körlerin iyi olmasý gerek|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt feels a bit agressive to me |pg||
nt|kingcur: As I said, there's a Bols tip dedicated to this...and I believe it was the late Hans Kreijns (Dutch expert) who taught us: does the bidding sound like a trump lead? Then lead ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: trumps, no matter what you're looking at in trumps|pg||

nt|athene: you must anticipate getting forced in hearts, so it's unlikely you will be able to use the clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: maybe a better plan was to cash the @DA at trick 2, then return the heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice to see that even Fantunes can err occasionally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner started with @DKx he can cash the @DK before giving you the heart ruff, and you can give him a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no need to underlead your @DA trying to pick up @DQxx with declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt =dd and down in practive if no helping bids in defence (like here) perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so we see lauria's opinion of the tricky bidding problem for balanced 24 count after 3@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: might very well get the clubs right - we shall see|pg||
nt|athene: he doubled and basically forced to 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lucky 6 @s for bear card bid and made quite lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  25 to 7=32 now we surely will see a slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  Facing a passed pd Aluf doesnt fancy 4@s and fancies defending 1N|pg||
nt|psridhar:  hence that pass of 1N|pg||
nt|kingcur: this looks like a Fantunes style of 2@H opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West might have passed - six spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might deem it unsuitable for a weak two |pg||
nt|gsper:  E has a lot of cards but does not know where to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  And knows even less now|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would bid 3NT now and go down|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s maybe...|pg||
nt|athene: defence have to be slightly careful here to cash out the diamonds and not for example try to cash two hearts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jaapfr: the systematic 2@D bid did S pass else he could bid and NS in a @H contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: clever action|pg||
nt|psyck: now @d goes away|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead should beat i suppose|pg||
nt|kingcur: @C lead too?|pg||
nt|psyck: well if he ducks & they play @d....|pg||
nt|psyck: else winning & playing @s will make|pg||
nt|kingcur: @CA and a spade probably, but no entry to enjoy the discard I think|pg||
nt|psyck: 4th seat 2 level bids generally show such hands|pg||
nt|psyck: as kibs point, will need to unblock @s Q & fin due to entry probs|pg||
nt|kingcur: that would be some play|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another failing 7 perhaps|pg||
nt|danilo1: hopefully only 6 this time :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We dont have any system notes. Has East showed @C+@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think so but just a guess|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: i am told, on the NS methods, if south WAS 4333, he would be 18-20, so that was out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i never see in table any one to finess @c -not expected here |pg||
nt|athene: west tries to conceal the position in clubs|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2@H was natural or 22-24 bal|pg||
nt|psridhar:  if sittng birds are to be shot.....|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR is behind us, so no scores|pg||
nt|psridhar:  and rarely u get to shoot Lauria's contract !|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gsper:  Opposite an overcall, Hedy?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: 6 either major makes with spades friendly.|pg||
nt|athene: so the defence don't realise the urgency to cash out in diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: tough call but he may see there are no other chances|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobholl: very good slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  clever it may hv been but NS can make 2@s and the upshot could well be -2 imps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: kickard, love it|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 6@H is a bit better than 6@S because you might make it even with a bad spade break, but it's hard to get out of a 4-4 fit once you lock into it|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play 9@H now only down chance |pg||
nt|psyck: wd|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|nilsland:  sry 24+ bal|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C looks like nat (@C support) and slam interest|pg||
nt|kingcur: 9 more to NS on  10, OR letting EW play in 2@S (down 2)|pg||
nt|kingcur: he did it, wd|pg||
nt|psyck: they really are FOXY|pg||
nt|kingcur: lol|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kareno: Yes, diamonds might produce an extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: so the underlead looks like a definite slip|pg||
nt|psyck: well, i did guess E would bid @s, just misguessed the number|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|nilsland:  but I do not know more|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Your guesses is as good as mine (or better)|pg||
nt|danilo1: and 4NT is probably @D cue ...so Sementa asks for third round control in @H now I thk|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either way looks a shakey auction|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... but he may get third round @S control :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: and 7 more on  11, OR in 2@C|pg||
nt|psyck: certainly been earning their imps against such a strong team|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobholl: no @S Q so 6 only|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if 2@S is 5/5, he knows W has diamonds - straw in the wind perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: from N point of vieuw a singleton @H is only chance but lauria wouldn't have covered|pg||
nt|psridhar:  unless Aluf has guts to shift to @H|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|psridhar:  and not cash his pd's Ace|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jaapfr: but agustin did realize:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: bu arada geçen senenin þampiyonu Prusa-M takýmý B grubunda mücadele eder durumda|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: 5@h may show two without trump queen.|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should have taken control with blackwood over 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: normally you don't want the limited hand as captain|pg||
nt|athene: east just wants to know if her partner has @SAQ, @HA, @DA - then 7 is good|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kareno: There's no safety play in the spade suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c - so old hat these days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be a very expensive @d7 discard|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: west can never know if 7 is good because he does not know his partner has six solid hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @S2 to K and club finesse?|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are criticizing 3@H, a bit unfairly I think|pg||
nt|gsper:  Considering the alternatives|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Again|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... 5NT is not the luckiest bid for EW|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Later today there will be some systemic discussion - in Italian....|pg||
nt|psridhar:  udca?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gsper:  3@H is not good, but what else is?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: some specs are suggesting that if west wants to give the impression he has no club honour in hand, the jack was a better card to play|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: that is usually what you would do, sure, but if you had a singleton club in hand you might try the king|pg||

nt|athene: east has some good news for 3nt (heart stop and two quick tricks on the side) but some very bad news (no diamond honour to help solidify the suit)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|athene: i have to say west did not really have any obvious alternative to 3@D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb 3@H|pg||

nt|psyck: yes guess they play it as some artificial raise here|pg||
nt|gsper:  E may have more than a game-going hand|pg||
nt|danilo1: so .. easy mathematics ... 1+1=3 :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West is in great trouble here|pg||
nt|tez: 5@d oynanabilir burda|pg||
nt|tez: ya da 5@s e yanlýþ karar verebilir|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 10 takým arasýnda|pg||
nt|psridhar:  NS may compete to 2@s here|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, see that too...the down-lead spoiled somewhere along the road to 4 tricks|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|danilo1: let us see how Fantunes agreements are functioning|pg||
nt|tez: sinclair muhtemelen sayý kazanýr bu elden|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno: e/w should push this one easily.|pg||
nt|athene: interesting; i expect east to just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: *expected|pg||
nt|athene: no support doubles for EW |pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|runnerup:  are we aware about situation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe one too many grappas at dinner|pg||
nt|runnerup:  maybe west bid 2 @s -yes looks better|pg||
nt|psridhar:  no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east must have thought 2@S was a relay and west thought it was natural by a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: now north may know his opponents have had a misunderstanding but he still has to judge whether to double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h=10-13, 5+@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: weird|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok --nonsence|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, E's hand could play very well opp fitting hands|pg||
nt|gsper:  3@C may be singleton ask|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, next round in 55 min.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think double is right|pg||
nt|gsper:  What on Earth is going on here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if they wake up and bid a cold 4@S you just hope that your teammate are in it anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now south might discover a diamond suit tucked away there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cc says 2@s=realy, but maybe that doesn't apply by a passed hand  |pg||
nt|athene: if partner asks you for non-spade suits and you have seven in one of them, you might want to bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s presumably some sort of fit-jump|pg||
nt|psyck: are we looking at the same boards :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is suggested that thay are playing board 29|pg||
nt|hedyg:  UNDO ?|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe the bidding is for board 29|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s kontrlu yaparlarsa Akgül takýmý sayý kazanýr|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: south is thinking how bad a dummy for diamonds his partner might put down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-3@h might have bought it|pg||
nt|athene: i guess something like 2-4-3-4 shape is possible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: something maybe not quite right here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is not gonna make :) .heh heh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think W playing 3@d on a 3-2 fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a bright kib said better W bidding 2@H and then 3@H (for the ones who see 3@H as 5/5m)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't know what 3@C means but i have no doubt they will bid 6@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: my guess is 3@H no major 4@D is choose anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C asking, 3@H no major, 4@D both majors (55)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: double 3@C looks normal with west but this will work out fine anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that might provoke 5@d|pg||
nt|athene: might be a problem now if north passes after a looong think, and south finds 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|gsper:  But even then 3@D is not obvious|pg||
nt|psyck: if so 3@d @c single (with 3@h @d single & 3@s @s single)?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Quite possibly|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead you might well need five diamond tricks so small to the queen is right, isn't it? gains against @DKx onside or @Dxx as here|pg||
nt|athene: @DKx or @DKxx|pg||
nt|ritong: down two, seems|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: even if North is known to have slow-passed, 5@d isn't unreasonable with 7411 shape|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually there are no pure penalty doubles, so was not 100% clear for south to pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: versace has a very good hand for slam in @H|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|queequeg: @s@S ====== Running Scores ====== @S@S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: versace elini 2 renkli olarak deðerlendirmek istemedi herhalde bu kötü @h rengi ile|pg||
nt|psridhar:  4-3-3-3 and only an ace+ 3 trumps , may not be ideal for 2@s that N hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: West doubled this 3NT in OR, presumably on @D breaking badly|pg||
nt|kingcur: but maybe against the odds: one down gains you only 2 imps, while making loses 5|pg||
nt|psyck: yes not worth doubling with opps NV|pg||
nt|kingcur: plus you may point declarer at a line of play that he would never come up with had you not doubled|pg||
pc|d4|nt|queequeg: W is playing 4@H in the OR|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: but N has gone on anyway, so no problem|pg||
nt|nilsland:  System notes says take-out but...|pg||
nt|tez: son elimiz|pg||
nt|tez: heyecanlý el|pg||
nt|tez: teþekkürler Ümit:)eline saðlýk|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: the down side of fit jumps is it also helps opponents to evaluate their fit|pg||
nt|psyck: if E found @c single , he did not want to try much beyond game...|pg||
nt|ritong: four trumps and three aces, basically|pg||
nt|bobholl: what he shows now with 5@C|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so now you lay down the @DA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|athene: west might duck a heart lead|pg||
nt|gsper:  We don't know how srong 2NT could have been|pg||
nt|ritong: i think doubling 2@d means " i have a strong opinion about 2@h"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not necissarily a disaster, NS have decent play for 3nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: poor south for an impossible choice (not that it makes any difference)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kör çakasýný engellemeye çalýþmalarý gerek idi|pg||
nt|psyck: dec can visualize some endplay on E now, i'd bet on this only -1 now|pg||
nt|psyck: say 3@s, 2@h, 2@d, & 1 on endplay|pg||
nt|kingcur: he's in dummy now though...somewhat inconvenient for setting up endplay|pg||
nt|adonis18:  let the @cl10 run|pg||
nt|psyck: that or play @s works|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobholl: N hand has dificult lead but after this bidding a @H lead stands out|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|kingcur: small @S might work too|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: yes, but if close to limit raise values, E can envisage a slam with right cards|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a third undertrick now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  for sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade pitch|pg||
nt|nilsland:  four trumps 2@D and the black aces|pg||
nt|danilo1: Fantoni has @D count - so he knows parner has @DQ ... he is thinking what to discard (may disc. @C and South may take and play @CJ) ... |pg||
nt|ritong: the trump promotion is visible|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kör oynarsa yapabilir|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: it would be interesting to know why East didn't simply raise hearts - but it might be a bit difficult to find out |pg||
nt|tez: kimse elenmiyor bu maç sonunda|pg||
nt|tez: 2 gün daha var|pg||
nt|tez: sonuçlar www.tbricfed.org.tr|pg||
nt|tez: ortaðýna @c çaktýrma umuduyla as @s koydu|pg||
nt|psridhar:  but it is better than letting Versace at the wheel in 1N-anyone believes in the DONT theory?:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|nt|danilo1: @CJ now ... |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|tez: dam @s düþünce |pg||
nt|psyck: didn't expect @h, but that can work too|pg||
nt|kingcur: but he's going sumarine it seems|pg||
nt|kingcur: submarine*|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: when you can afford to lose one trick it's better to play the ace first because if you finesse the queen and lose to the king, you have a guess next time whether to play south for ...|pg||
nt|athene: singleton king or KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|MolvaM: defans koz oynamalý deklaran ise kör oynamalý idi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: biraz tersi oluyor þu an|pg||
nt|bobholl: against lauria sure :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: no score available|pg||
nt|psridhar:  i believe in DONT whenever the likes of Versace declare 1N vs me |pg||
pc|d9|nt|bobholl: very good bidding|pg||
nt|smispi: write down the dates please|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: two rounds of diamonds for four down |pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S ------ Running Ranking ------ @S@S|pg||

nt|athene: well, no need - he can't get to dummy to finesse the trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: true|pg||
nt|athene: as long as versace doesn't play a trump here it's 4 down :)|pg||
