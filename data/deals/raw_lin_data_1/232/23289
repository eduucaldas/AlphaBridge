nt|Walddk3: 4 segments of 12 boards in the final, 2 segments tonight, 2 tomorrow morning|pg||
nt|tec1234: A 50% slam in NT - worse in @S as an even trump break needed|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: West owed his partner a diamond cue-bid in the other room, I think|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|tec1234: South is probablu hoping they will bid the slam as the K@C may be a trick - he will be disappointed|pg||

nt|Walddk3: We are in Cape Town, the second-most populous city in South Africa, and the provincial capital and primate city of the Western Cape. Beautiful scenery I can assure you|pg||

nt|tec1234: Welcome back all - The Stabell brothers have now come in to face Eber/Bosenberg and will be hoping a few 50/50 decisons will go their way this set|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Eber has taken a crushing start but the two slams could have gone the other way|pg||
nt|tec1234: We will start at Board 23 so that we will have comparisons for 13-22|pg||

mb|p|nt|cenglund:  You are right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cenglund:  True|pg||
nt|tec1234: starnge view by Eber - 5@D should ask for Q@S, and 5@S would deny - the muzzle continues :)|pg||

nt|tec1234: It is a poor slam, but would have been more fun to see the lead against 6@S - a heart looks right against 5@S|pg||
