mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|bigtrain: looks like the other room went down in 3NT which i beieve can be made|pg||

nt|bigtrain: henry do you have any idea how this score was handled?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bigtrain: W is squeezed in 3 suits|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|3for3: It was tied on vugraph after 105, but that is unofficial|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: seems unlikely, unless there was some massive adjustment on appeal|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|vugraphzfk: didnt get bidding sry|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: appeal changed to 2HXX down 1|pg||
nt|3for3: so, shouldnt that mean nickell leads?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but that should mean nickell is leading|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it should|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: ibelieve that nickell is up 11 or 12|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think the score is reversed here|pg||
nt|3for3: there was a differing explanation on an alertable call, and the ruling changed the score from plus 300 for spector, to 200 for nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: i believe that is correct but I will try to change score in a minute|pg||
nt|dburn: but this looks like a losing position for Nickell - 3NT would have made, but 5@c almost certainly will not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is the score  heard|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bigtrain: his hand falls apart on the barage of diamonds before that happens|pg||
nt|3for3: cant he pitch one spade and 2 hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Play is at tric 9..i will report result in a min|pg||
nt|3for3: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the problem was in the open room they cashed the hearts and lost communication for the squeeze to work|pg||
nt|3for3: seems like that adjustment should be 12, not 21...|pg||

nt|petergill: Back on Bd 46 - the maths indicated to play N for @CJ, but N's choice of a @D switch instead of a @C switch was possibly mildly suggestive of N having @CJ (or possibly not, at this ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets:  not enough only 500 against 650|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@S = 0-2 controls|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 3NT = to play|pg||
nt|3for3: this looks like a dull 4@H|pg||

pc|dA|nt|petergill: N's theory is that with South knowing where the missing HCP are, and with finesses likely to work, less than the usual  25 points are needed for 3NT to make, with 1NT overcaller ...|pg||

mb|1C|nt|barnets:  here 5 major the limit again with clubs lying well|pg||
nt|athene: EW can survive 5@S here although it shouldn't come to that|pg||
mb|1H|nt|algraves:  1@C strong of course, 2@C positive I presume with long clubs|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@H from grue, double from meckstroth|pg||
nt|athene: lots of suggestions for Grue here|pg||
nt|barnets:  should he bid 4@H east may x and west 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sorry lost connect contracr was 4s w making 7|pg||
nt|barnets:  the third in hand opener is quite normal for any of these guys|pg||
nt|athene: making 7? that's a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: hamman has support but not enough values for a direct raise|pg||
nt|algraves:  forcing NT, one of the hand types is a weak heart raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Al is right that the lack of aces and kings is a negative factor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = natural GF|pg||
nt|ady: last hand   several kibs suggest east ducks 2nd heart    will give declarer some problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have been @D & @H    not sure if 1@D also show both|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: nice trump support|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@D key card in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suspect just @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: how about france?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 33% of that|pg||
nt|3for3: spade to queen|pg||
nt|3for3: club hook|pg||
mb|d|nt|bigtrain: were they french?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: alerted|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobh1: hurd is 4333 but with prime high cards|pg||
nt|ady: 4NT?|pg||
nt|algraves:  2 key cards, no Queen of @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sry we are having internet problems|pg||
nt|algraves:  well then do away with the invitational raise if that is the position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's 2@H walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = @S raise|pg||
nt|bigtrain: versace and lauria|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|algraves:  if the club is in your bag then at some point you should use it.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|algraves:  3@H limit of better in principle|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thts helpful...  you can't go south  ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: declarer's problem is more a death of tricks than the bad trump break|pg||
nt|algraves:  Grand slam try asking more information|pg||
nt|algraves:  so Cheek, knows that his partner has neither Major King|pg||
nt|ady: maybe some sort of asking bid in diamonds?|pg||
nt|algraves:  6 imps is not cheap|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C= natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3@D = Q|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to push if the result from the open room is correct|pg||
nt|3for3: that is a very good hand for a 15-17 nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|bigtrain: colan|pg||
nt|3for3: 3nt down in other room i am told|pg||
nt|dburn: it is, but what could you do? open 1@c and rebid 2NT?|pg||
nt|3for3: so, spector back in the lead|pg||
nt|3for3: that is what i'd do|pg||
nt|3for3: oh, my spies misinformedme!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: but i think he can manage|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  no ! assume more key card, ie asking for informatino|pg||
nt|algraves:  I suspect 5NT showed interest as he could have bid 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: 5d asked for kings|pg||
nt|algraves:  So this showed the Kick back method of asking for Key cards, ie one above agreed trumps to advantage|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT down? not according to this|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  So well done|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bebechira1: it was problem with the set-up|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Mesbur-Fitzgibbons??|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, it would go about four down on a heart lead, but...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2:  heart, spade back|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobh1: kibs are taking both sides of this one|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobh1: Zia @C play is not popular with the naysayers|pg||
nt|algraves:  easier when you can see all 4 hands and are in the back row|pg||
nt|bobh1: of course we can all see much more of the deal than Zia can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but that is the kibitizers long held right|pg||
nt|algraves:  without Oscar the Owl the game would be poorer|pg||
nt|bobh1: Zia plays MUD it appears|pg||
nt|bobh1: this may be a source of confusion for Joel|pg||
nt|bobh1: normally a player leading the 5 then playing the 9 would have the Q|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a timed event but long pauses for thought are normal and permitted|pg||
nt|bobh1: when they start to add up, the director starts getting nasty|pg||
nt|algraves:  Well Woldridge can build a club trick with the right view but that is hardly clear|pg||
nt|bobh1: no timers...if the table is slow, then we start arguing about whose fault it was|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  And you can deny declarer access to dummy to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bigtrain: he goggled the answer :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i couldn't stand the strain of waiting :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|danilo1: once Zia led @C (and not @HK), he is doing best to continue - and force declarer's @C decision immediatelly (he may have led from Q95(2)) ... after all, East did not Dble 4@S ... ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: and he is "known" to have probably @HQ (no @H lead) and 5 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: right walter|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: ...if anyone actually led a heart, his copy of the hand records should gently be removed from him before allowing play to continue|pg||
nt|3for3: i think meckwells nt range is 14-16 here, so clearer for him to upgrade|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no --  didn't use google|pg||

nt|bobh1: not sure exactly how :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe he just claimed and they conceeded|pg||
nt|algraves:  he played a second Club first of course|pg||
nt|algraves:  Always difficult to bid those type of grand slams because you can talk yourself into a conservative position|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: contract here is 3n by south|pg||
nt|athene: this might go (2@S) X 3@C lebensohl 3@H 3@S 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Sabine Auken and Paul Marston recommend that you lead from your four-card suit rather than from the five-bagger. They would have defeated it|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well if north bid 3@D rather than 3@C actually that is more likely|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: last board here, we ll resume in 30 min for the last set today|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the battle of the mjors coming up|pg||
mb|1C!|an|atrong|nt|ady: n/s may get toohigh|pg||
nt|algraves:  requires partnership trust and \ or personal courage|pg||
nt|algraves:  so the loss on board 49 was 4 imps when Meckwell played 2@H making|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks in spades on the lay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: serving nother neb|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: south has a useful hand   decent spades with 2 outside aces|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 49 at other table, Jeff Meckstroth overcalled the Precision 1@D with 1@H, as his two small spades and likely (possible) spade lead or switch after short 1@D opener and his ...|pg||
nt|petergill: minimum values opposite passed hand made 1NT unattractive |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|barnets:  spector gained 10 imps on board 63 when n/s bid game here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
mb|d|nt|algraves:  They have a way to invite in @S shoiwing 5|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this shows that hand|pg||
nt|algraves:  invitational with @S 5|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, next board for me to misanalyze|pg||
mb|1S|nt|barnets:  so the lead now is 65|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  I suspect we did not quite see the play correctly|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: well stopped|pg||
nt|algraves:  and he trusts his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd on Roland's list of terrible bridge terms|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: from declarer;s perspective..club length is unknown after 1d opener|pg||
nt|barnets: if declarer ducks a club east might shift to a spade and  may possibly set up one club 2 diamonds one heart and one spade trick for the defense|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|algraves:  yes although that was not a minimum hand with two tens and 2 Aces, 2Kings and a working j|pg||
nt|algraves:  certinaly suited for play in Hearts though, the classic 4-3 fit type hand , strong trumps and prime cards outside|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: Yes. I think it was mostly the spade holding that deterred Meckstroth from 1NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  to facilitate ruffing in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: wd Meckstroth anyway|pg||
nt|3for3: no alert, but we can assume zias 3@C was preemptive/mixed|pg||
nt|dburn: luckily for Nickell, neither of those superb players is qualified to play in the US trials - still, there are doubtless some vacant properties still in Monaco|pg||
nt|3for3: this 3nt looks flat|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ady: declarer will be pleased with the 9 tricks    not certain to make |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: not real bidding|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ady: 10 tricks in OR   a good return|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll take the declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: here's an auction and a defense we can all understand|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say he wins and plays a spade now|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to cornel teodorescu|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: declarer can set up 3 spade winners (at least DD)|pg||
nt|barnets: now dec is a tempo ahead|pg||
nt|barnets: he may have gone wrong before|pg||
pc|d3|nt|algraves:  My Mom would bring this in, with her only consistent line of play|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm this is a bit interesting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wants to go over to dummy and finesse hearts to keep east off lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sry put contract i to follow play|pg||
nt|athene: but if he cashes the @DQ whilst he is there, he sets up diamond tricks and an entry for east|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: msy make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|leroumain: ty:)|pg||
nt|gheo1954: E paseaza cu un prelung oftat|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: maybe he will now decide he has to just bash out hearts from the top|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really make use of the @h98|pg||
nt|athene: for example club to king, heart to jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Cheek thinking|pg||
nt|athene: because if that finesse lost, a club return would tangle your entries|pg||
nt|barnets:  he may x to dummy and lead the @H 8 to the J|pg||
nt|athene: yes, maybe you can do that, and then duck if west wins and shifts to a club|pg||
nt|barnets:  ibut a club retun hurts transport here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|algraves:  Hurd is a terrific player , dont get me wrong, but at some point.... as I said. It is a good debate when the stakes are 4-6 imps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|algraves:  which was to pull trump and take whatever finesses were about|pg||
nt|ady: a squeeze materialised on east|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cA|nt|algraves:  on this hand there are none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe at this point he is regretting ducking the first trick as it gives him slightly less elbow-room for a throw-in ending|pg||
nt|athene: but he was not sure spades were 6-1, meckstroth being in first seat at favourable, i guess|pg||
nt|barnets:  he could duck it thouhgh|pg||
nt|bigtrain: briar patch|pg||
nt|bebechira: many thanks for help mr Teodorescu :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=K9+J5+AK9+AJ9632  17.6 that last S hand, so Meckstroth was right to upgrade to a strong club|pg||
pc|sA|nt|algraves:  Grue is trying for some elimination so the the opps have to start @H|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|barnets:  and is ok|pg||
nt|athene: well now it's ok as he can just duck the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: thanks to that @C9|pg||

nt|leroumain: sint comentator:)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|3for3: and borderlind whether to upgrade to 18|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets:  so well played|pg||
nt|barnets:  playing hearts from top would be silly had east the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: this line would only be wrong if west had all the clubs, QJ10x|pg||
nt|3for3: i am sure with the 10 of clubs, we'd have seen a different auction|pg||

nt|athene: double-dummy you can make this of course, but in practice i think it will go down|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: now to pick up the trumps, without any other factors, you have to decide whether to cash the ace or jack|pg||
nt|athene: @SK10xx and singleton x is more likely than @S10xxx and singleton king|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: because there are three small singletons and only one king|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|bebechira: here we go lol..|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: 2nt promises four spades here for meckwell as they don't need to go through stayman with just a 2nt raise without any major|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobh1: and will make easily|pg||
nt|bobh1: interesting lead by Joel if irrelevant on this deal|pg||
nt|bobh1: when they each bid notrump after your opening bid, time to look elsewhere for your lead|pg||
nt|3for3: although with a match this close, every trick does count!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: said took club finesse for 13..took 12|pg||
nt|leroumain: etvoila:)|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|bigtrain: 2@H is intermediate|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  the big club players these days have developed a keen eye for what auctions make it hard for the opponents to bid accurately|pg||
nt|algraves:  for instance on that hand some standard experts would raise to 2@H to make their game auction easier in case partner has strong hand.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H ony choice|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     e/w  might win the auction in hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs a bit more to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is michaels|pg||
nt|dburn: likely flat, because Meckwell have lots of wrenches, but still...|pg||
nt|3for3: featherweight opening by hurd|pg||
nt|3for3: I guess he likes his shape and good spot cards|pg||
nt|dburn: not exactly a Mike Tyson overcall by Hamman either|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2:  Down 2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Spector has found the 4-1 split  |pg||
nt|3for3: 3@D a fit jump, likely|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S will be too|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2NT showed exactly 3 spades, hence E knew that they had a 5-3 spade fit. I'm not sure how West asks for @HQ|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d must be something special - can't believe it's just diamonds and clubs; what about hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: i can't see what was written|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|algraves:  playing precision you know partner is limited so game in unlikely unless partner can start jumping aroudn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal  18+ bal,   2@D = game force 5+@D|pg||
nt|athene: nice @S10 makes 3nt very comfortable here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 97 might be misscored|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks|pg||
nt|3for3: 4nt ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: how about x for the flexibility|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|algraves:  so 1@S muddies the waters a little bit more than 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think with his good 19 count, West intended 5@S as a queen ask, but when it's Hamman who passes 5@S, one tends to think that Hamman is usually right |pg||
nt|algraves:  we are not quite sure what the deeper meaning of the last bid was. but 6@H or 6NT are easy makes so an opportunity for Spector|pg||
nt|algraves:  I bet they are irritated though. That much we know for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D also ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: negative DBL by north is much easier IF 1@D=4+@D unbal|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i took care of it :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: operators don't listen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: really can't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: rodwell doesn't want jeff to declare..lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4 pici au fost optimiste :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  just to finish for board 20 , I suspect that declarer also took the 4th club and then led a diamond to his QT. The defense had no answer to that line|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are splitting up later this year. Hamman will play with Justin Lall in another team and Levin-Weinstein will replace Zia - Hamman in the much-heralded famous Nickell team |pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: S told W he had no idea about XX.. conflicts with N explanation|pg||
nt|bebechira1: it seems we restarted :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|algraves:  it is possible that South, after being told the Mecks pass was not penalty decided just to pass and let Rodwell start bidding , sure he would not be passing for penalty|pg||
nt|3for3: which they don't, of course|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzfk: Director was already in room and is discussing situation with Eric|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: with longer clubs North would balance with 1NT, not Dbl|pg||
nt|algraves:  well said|pg||
nt|petergill: Time now to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  so on the next round, having limited his hand with 1@D he can suggest max values with a club card|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|bigtrain: why can't you beat 3NT?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: will likely be a flat result|pg||
nt|petergill: South has tried to get North to declare 3NT if North has KJ or Qx or J10x or J9x or the like in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening lead against Zia's 3N was @S9|pg||
nt|barnets: this  should be down 2 for 5 imps to spector subject to appeal|pg||
pc|d9|nt|algraves:  so two down|pg||

nt|algraves:  so just to follow up on the 2@S bid. |pg||
nt|ady: how did that make?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from NS SSF   "Mid-hand honor leads: shift to 10 generally shows interior sequence (HJT or HT9), typically lead rusinow through declarer (except as above)"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swing action for Rodwell would be PASS :)   looks like auto opener for him|pg||
nt|athene: this could get very competitive if NS find their diamond fit|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s may compete to 5@D|pg||
nt|leroumain: doctorul ar fi meritat un pas la 1@s|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|algraves:  if it is invitational then when the opps blast to 4@H then partner can make a reasonable decisoin|pg||
nt|bebechira: pai nu e forcing?|pg||

nt|leroumain: de ce sa fie forcing?|pg||
nt|gheo1954: un tur e forcing |pg||
mb|d|nt|bebechira: nu cred ca 1 puca se poate pasa|pg||
mb|1D|nt|algraves:  if you bid just 1@S then it is a tough choice all aroudn|pg||
nt|3for3: normal 4@H game, Spector stole a trick in the OR|pg||
nt|bebechira: pica lol|pg||
mb|3C|nt|algraves:  and 2@S weak is just not that effective anymore |pg||
nt|algraves:  2@S invitainol has much more reward |pg||
nt|barnets: slam bid in open room |pg||
nt|leroumain: ahbonsipartenerul cu 5 punte si 3@s ce zice?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: we knew somebody sitting EW would bid 1@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: strong result for nickell in the OR|pg||
nt|dburn: he'll need to steal more of those than there are boards if he's to win this one - still, one big swing...|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ady: was jsut what south wanted to hear    but a normal opening |pg||
nt|ady: both major games should go down e/w    both 4-1 trump splits|pg||
nt|bigtrain: deoesn't seem likely it will be bid here|pg||
nt|barnets: north drove to slam after souths 4 @H raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: a club splinter will do the job here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|petergill: everyone at this world class elvel usually falsecards with @SQ or @S7 if worried about a ruff, so by playing the natural card of @S , Hurd was trying to make Zia think that East's ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @S( was not a doubleton. Very delicate. Only an expert would fall for the true card being "tricky"|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 51|pg||
nt|algraves:  good point|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2cupe daca are 2 cupe sau 1nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: daca are 5 cupe :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: if they get to slam after this start...  )|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: on my good days i hold 5 trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: in  6@H dec was assisted with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: he ruffed|pg||
mb|6H|nt|bobh1: Zia's pushy 4@S call might backfire as if they struggle into 4@S NS might not save and 4@S might make|pg||
nt|petergill: East's @S9 i mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: There are some seeding points in play for 2013 trials, but only for intact teams and only to get bye to R16|pg||
nt|barnets: drew trumps and conceded a diamond|pg||
nt|bebechira: in dona 9 se joaca 3 cupe contrate in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: probably going down|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW can make a could of @Ss|pg||
nt|ady: in fact the hand belongs ot n./s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should call those "placement points"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: potential committee  for 11 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice or lucky stop?|pg||
nt|barnets: undo|pg||
nt|barnets: please|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, if you don t you will have trouble playing the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: on the previous board, they tell me cohler is in 4@S on a @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks walter|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: I'm not sure if 2Nt is intended as showing a good raise to 3@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sorry..lost connection|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barnets: 5@S would be down 1 on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: so par for n/s is 500 +|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: a sort of good-bad 2NT|pg||
nt|petergill: which forced 3@C perhaps. |pg||
nt|algraves:  well we dont know in these cases|pg||
nt|petergill: South's hesitation over 3@D makes it look like S thinks N has more than N has|pg||
nt|algraves:  but we can assume that they do|pg||
nt|algraves:  Cheek and Grue continue there sure footed play by bidding 6NT where Hamman Zia missed the slam|pg||
nt|algraves:  that has 12 tricks on any distribution|pg||
nt|petergill: Wooldridge has a lot of points, but many of them are locked up in the KQ doubleton in clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w i mean|pg||
nt|bigtrain: like i said...  strong result in the OR :)|pg||
nt|barnets: yes well done by ralph katz in north|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: 3s was q|pg||
nt|mildredb: nickell made the 4@H call|pg||
nt|barnets: and nickel too who evaluated more than here|pg||
nt|mildredb: I can't imagine not bidding slam if pard bids 4@H/2|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: destined to go down|pg||
nt|algraves:  he would have had to play 3 rounds of clubs pitching both hearts, |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: kibs suggesting 5 clubs or 5 diamonds make    but 11th trick not really there   |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C makes but after the @H tap you can only make 10 tricks in @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe a @D lead beats 5@C also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge bid 3@S over 3@D  auction isn't over yet|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes...  @D lead beats 5@C since you need a @H ruff for the 11th trick|pg||
nt|ady: heart tap in diamonds will stop any chance of ruffing a spade in north hand   and in 5 clubs a diamond lead  would  force trumps to be drawn to stop a heart ruff in south hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now it is   other room 3@S East|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: a toy to show majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: if you have to bid 2@h with this rockcrusher as well as with 12 5422, troubles are not unexpected|pg||
nt|mildredb: I agree, David, that is why I think Nickell gets credit for the slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: this will be quick..|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: sorry..typo guys..hurd passed over 3c|pg||
nt|dburn: potential for Nickell here, though - plus 300 North-South looks pretty good|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobh1: that seems to be the popular range among these young tigers|pg||
nt|gheo1954: iaca o dona mai interesanta|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  requires @D lead to defeat 3NT if my double dummy analysis is correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: picked-em clean in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  Well the feeling " on the street" was that this was going to be a close well played match|pg||
nt|ady: yesz  should lose 3 diamonds and 2 aces|pg||
nt|algraves:  note the effect of the NS bidding . it made it very hard on EW to have a sure footed auctino|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue envisions hand playing on cross ruff after 3@C from Meck|pg||
nt|barnets: on 71 nickel had a chance when spector bid up to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: well stolen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unusul way to win 3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unusual|pg||
nt|leroumain: flancul pare simplu -1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Raising the hearts which South showed by doubling 1@H|pg||
nt|barnets: but north has to lead the @HA|pg||
nt|gheo1954: acum e acum|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|ady: did 3@H  promise anything   was a leb bid available after east doubled 2 spades?|pg||
nt|petergill: Should be 130|pg||
nt|barnets: and led a " normal " @DK|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|algraves:  of course you need to be playing a strong club to give you cover on hans like this , so that the non one club openers are limited to 15|pg||
nt|gheo1954: offf|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: 4 hearts hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: is this lead true?|pg||
nt|algraves:  so one can argue wether West should have bid , the point was that NS just doing there normal bidding made it difficult to sort everything out.|pg||
nt|algraves:  They play Rusinow in bid suits|pg||
nt|petergill: or he might play "safe" (unsafe if clubs 4-1) for 110 by not trying the @D hook|pg||
pc|sA|nt|algraves:  and why not lead a @S?|pg||
nt|algraves:  got to lead something|pg||
nt|dburn: and unless Hurd makes a somewhat unlikely seven overtricks here, plus 300 North-South will score pretty well|pg||
nt|3for3: the cards lay very well for north south|pg||
pc|s7|nt|leroumain: negativ:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: Al, can you see why @SQ is a good play here?|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot, but if Zia is doing it, there must be a reason|pg||
nt|dburn: and I am sure why West raised it, and why North-South withdrew from the auction - they could not know how good a fit they had|pg||
pc|h4|nt|algraves:  remember the @D bid just said no 5 card major not 14-16 balanced not 6 clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i like 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge in 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 1@S automatic|pg||
nt|bigtrain: totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S needs suit quality|pg||
nt|gheo1954: lacomia|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: seems a diamond lead more normal than underleading 5 card suit with the ace|pg||
nt|3for3: grue penalized for super light opening.|pg||
nt|3for3: Of couse, a spectator notes that if he had rebid 2@C....|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe that would have been Gazzilli, or some such - no one has voluntarily bid clubs to show clubs since about 1983|pg||
nt|3for3: I suspect he didnt relish the though of a preference to his 98653 of hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: not gazilli|pg||
nt|3for3: they do the big club thing|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobh1: if it was 15-17, S would invite|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, Grue judged to lead the suit the partnership was known to have, and put declarer to potential guess at trick one.|pg||
nt|ady: whatever led    no chance to make|pg||
nt|algraves:  if King in dummy declarer may well get it wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl makes @DK likely to be offside, so there was a real danger of a @D ruff if @D was played at Trick 2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|athene: @CA was a falsecard i guess|pg||
nt|athene: trying to make declarer put east with another high card somewhere else|pg||
nt|athene: for example the @SK :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   i think @CA to help clarify 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: well, if he played the @CK at trick 1 and then turned up with the @HQ as a passed hand, it would not be too hard to drop the @SK|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|algraves:  personally I like the dash of that lead even though it cost a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  even though it did not gain a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  did not cost |pg||
nt|gheo1954: Zoli om cu frica lui Dumnezeu da X cand e asigurat de + 800|pg||
nt|nightbell: :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: dont think it cost  |pg||
nt|petergill: Even with @DK onside, a @D ruff was posible if the @D hook was taken|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|nt|bobh1: and N wouldn't open 1N altho they often promote and demote out of range hands|pg||
nt|agumperz:  David Stevenson Blog: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/def_1nt01.htm|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one doesn't look promotable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps -- but i suspect more geared toward @D suit pref|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he knew Cheek was ruffing -- so takes opportunity to help Rodwell|pg||
nt|athene: well declarer is just short of tricks now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: even if he gets the spades right|pg||
nt|athene: he had to lead a diamond towards the queen i suppose|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  71  5@S made -- but played by West   too tough to find @HA @H ruff that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  72 [3NN-2]    Nickelly declaring 3N South    waiting for opening lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: looks a bit impossible to me|pg||
nt|dburn: if this is forcing, OK, but if it isn't it might end the NS auction|pg||
nt|dburn: but now South may feel in duty bound to support diamonds, which as far as I can see he has not yet done|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he never supported @D|pg||

nt|bebechira: great job Raluca ....bye all|pg||
nt|gheo1954: dar tot juste le facea ca stie jocul :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C game force promises either 4@H or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: it's not good enough anyway but it would give declarer a nasty moment|pg||
nt|leroumain: dupa ce dadea 2@s si 2@c|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|algraves:  es I think he wanted the @S trick now and wanted an entry to hand to deal with trumps eventually and just as you say, so as not to have to broach diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|3for3: oooh, i thought spector was going to play the same contract at both tables for a second|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: There might be an "intra-finesse" here for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that line was a result of Larry Cohen's book on Law of Total Tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i used bad instead of new math    Diamond +78|pg||
nt|barnets: against hearts|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobh1: Joel might have sniffed at slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S by Cheek  stopper showing   and implies concern about @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told   Edgar Kaplan wrote "All 4H bids are transfers to 4S"" 30 years before Larry Cohen wrote about the Law of Total Tricks.|pg||
nt|leroumain: lucky 3nt in loc de 4@h|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|barnets: how about a spade lead v 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS had too much information to play the mundane [and makeable] 3N|pg||
pc|cK|nt|algraves:  gadzooks an intra finesse in @D|pg||
nt|algraves:  we bring you all the exciting news|pg||
nt|petergill: In @D, lead low to 7 or 9, then run queen for one loser. The term intra-finesse was invented by Gabriel Chagas of Brazil in (I think) a Bols Bridge Tip|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky lie of the EW cards seems to doom everything now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: maybe South could double (which shows spades and tolerance for diamonds) and then bid diamonds anyway|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|dburn: still, no great harm done - no one could take a swing at four diamonds, so Spector will win an IMP or two|pg||

nt|athene: 6@D is not too bad a contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south hand perfect for Raptor 1N overcall   but the only top pairs i know who play that are from Scandinavia/Germany|pg||
nt|barnets: good result n/s in open|pg||

nt|algraves:  of course|pg||

pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Poland too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was told by many :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: still, maybe he needs a perfect hand opposite, and maybe he is mindful of his partner's dictum: "don't play me for the perfect hand, I never have it"|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: right   i included them in "scandinavian"|pg||
nt|bigtrain: has to break them sometime|pg||

nt|ady: diamond to ace     spade to ace    cash 1 more diamond   and duck a club|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|algraves:  Maxwell Smart was played of course by Don Adams, agent 86 and he was an avid bridge player. I played rubber bridge with him at the old Cavenish west in LA  a baziion years ago|pg||
nt|petergill: Even I (who have lost the Aussie Open Team Playoff Grand Final by one imp twice in recent years, including a few weeks ago) regard overtricks at imps as less important than ...|pg||
nt|petergill: maintaining full focus on the big swings|pg||

nt|algraves:  so this is his flashback time here at 86 apiece|pg||
nt|3for3: well done to nickell|pg||
nt|dburn: but Hamman had the perfect hand for Zia's decision - one where the club finesse lost|pg||
nt|3for3: partner could have had qx of clubs, and slam would be...better|pg||
nt|dburn: come back tomorrow - we're gonna do fractions|pg||
pc|s3|nt|algraves:  perhaps it is possible to train the mind to maintain relaxed full focus in all situations. ( not that I can mind you )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule says restart in 75 minutes   but teams can agree to start earlier  [boards not duplicated across matches]|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: 2|pg||
nt|ady: this line better  as can cash 3rd diamond  in case jack comes down|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 59, the vulnerability was very suitable for East to balance with 2@S (or West with Dbl), which would have forced NS to find an intrafinesse in 3@H - or perhaps EW go to 3@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not hopeless. |pg||
nt|petergill: Compared to me, the younger brains of people like Justin Lall, Joe Grue, Wooldridge - Hurd can give their all for every trick without hampering their concentration for the 7th or ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 8th day of these long events|pg||
nt|algraves:  An excellent set by Hurd and Wooldridge, they will sleep well tonight|pg||
nt|algraves:  Nickell team may need to mount a bit of a comeback in the 60 boards tomorrow|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that was the last board of the segment|pg||
nt|petergill: Resume tomorrow |pg||
nt|algraves:  bye all still a few boards left in other room if you all just move over|pg||
nt|algraves:  thanks to BBO for this great service and Roland Wald for organizing it all|pg||
nt|petergill: Hard to believe, but Grue - Cheek and Meckwell is the slow table, relatively. |pg||
nt|petergill: Meckwell are famous for their magnificent comebacks at the end of matches ..this match will be challenging, even for them|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all|pg||
nt|algraves:  spector is an extremely good team. Tomorrows 2nd half will be excellent bridge. Yo'all come back now|pg||
nt|algraves:  well Peter did say something but lost in the white noise|pg||
nt|algraves:  besides we are tired|pg||
nt|algraves:  you clearly are fresh and wide awake|pg||
nt|algraves:  talking about 2@S byEW on board 59|pg||
nt|algraves:  a kibitizer wondering why we did not mention the lack of competition on board 59 and I pointed out that teh commentators are old and tired at this point|pg||
nt|petergill: I did write up Bd 59's lack of EW bidding, as Bd 60 was being played. |pg||
nt|petergill: I will take the liberty of writing a summary of this segment ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 57 - good aggressive bidding by Meckwell gained|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 55 - Nickell team was unlucky, with a lot of imps at stake|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 54 - superior bidding by Hurd - Wooldridge gained|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 52  Zia - Hamman's bidding went off the rails, but we do not know what the bids should mean|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 51 - superior bidding and play by Hurd- Wooldridge|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49 - excellent bidding judgement by Meckstroth gained|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 47 - bad lie of cards (@HK under AQ) for Meckwell who took bidding risk that backfired|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 46 - Cheek made a game - Zia's line of play which failed at this table looks OK to me, and the computer was down so we don't know how Cheek played it, but he did well|pg||
nt|petergill: Overall Summary - very high quality bridge - just one big slip up on Bd 52. Spector team deserved their segment win. Here in Australia at our top level, we make far more errors ...|pg||
nt|petergill: than these guys do. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: might not be able to start Round 7 early -- maybe directors union guarantess a full lunch break|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|algraves:  so Cheek had a cheery moment for his well thought out lead but his partner let him down by not having a setting trick|pg||
nt|ady: think thats all for the session    thx all|pg||
nt|algraves:  Yep thanks to all of you.|pg||
nt|algraves:  perhaps it will stay tied at 86 until the next set starts|pg||
