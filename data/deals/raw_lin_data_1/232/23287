nt|newmoon: 3 Bulletins from Congress so far:   http://www.sabf.co.za/nationals/index.html|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4 segments of 12 boards in the final, 2 segments tonight, 2 tomorrow morning|pg||
nt|tec1234: A 50% slam in NT - worse in @S as an even trump break needed|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: West owed his partner a diamond cue-bid in the other room, I think|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|tec1234: South is probablu hoping they will bid the slam as the K@C may be a trick - he will be disappointed|pg||

nt|tec1234: 1@S was chosen in both rooms - looks more like a 2@S bid if we want to try to disrupt|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We are in Cape Town, the second-most populous city in South Africa, and the provincial capital and primate city of the Western Cape. Beautiful scenery I can assure you|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: The cricket ground is of course the most beatiful place of them all|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@s would have been my choice by both e and s.|pg||

nt|tec1234: Declarer know he will need a lot of luck here and probaly need an even spade break, with the A@S onside and the A@H right - so will probably use the @D entries to lead spades twice ...|pg||
