mb|p|nt|santyclz: When the opponents open an artificial strong or multi-meaning 1@c it's usually a good idea to preempt before their hands can be further defined.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: S certainly gave e-w every opportunity to lead trumps for him, but they didn't cooperate.|pg||

mb|2N|nt|andreasw:  3@s is the limit for N-S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Presumably x is takeout.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  after east opening bid 3nt looks nice -but @s finess off and this 22 points 3nt would fail -of course in is not biddable and west in with 2 @s now so other story|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you don't leave this one in, when will you?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @s very scary -if partner has opening hand and short @s -youll lose hundreds and ns makes nothing|pg||
nt|santyclz: And don't forget that pd opened in 3rd seat so may have a sub-minimal hand with short @ss.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|santyclz: Oh my.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: with the potential ruffs by W |pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -on 1 level @s is ok -but 2 -level and strong hand behind partners -poss weak opening so pass is my tips|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: now can make 7 |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|santyclz: S didn't show  primary support of n (unless their x is abnormal), and n never began to show his hand.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andreasw:  im guessing this will be -1:) unless Stokka can guess @s K|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9: I think east took 3@C as singleton or void|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|penseur9: maybe +2 on @S finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: @D suit hidden, and I wonder what 3 or 4 @D would have been by N |pg||
nt|santyclz: This is similar to the last board where with primary support n x'd an overcall instead of showing support.  A very difficult way to play.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might play neg frees |pg||
