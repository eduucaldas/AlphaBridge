nt|STRIK3R: 4@h is a good contract, the 4-1 split against can become a problem|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: think it must be forcing, 2@d that is|pg||
nt|varange: yes, if it shows extras|pg||
nt|varange: I'm trying to decide if I'd bid a forcing 1NT with the west hand if it was available, or 1@s|pg||
nt|varange: after 1@h that is|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: I see, I would bid 1@s my self, since I dont play 1N forcing :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|varange: yes, 1@s is the "normal" bid in 2/1 as well|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: might be thinking fo slam in west now, all he need for that to be a nice contract is AKQxx in @h, KQxx in @d and singleton @s|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: *of|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|varange: the redouble?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|varange: denying stopper?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: I use it as first round controll, might show a "half" stopper?|pg||
nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: well, if it denies a stopper, then west would upgrade his hand because he would think there were no wasted values in clubs|pg||
nt|varange: but his 3@h makes me think they also play the rdbl as a half stopper|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Not many top losers, but problems in the diamond suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ideally, Marstrander would like to ruff two clubs in the dummy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|baldjean: Unfortunately W does not know about QJ@d|pg||

pc|c6|nt|friggi: game over|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He may play a trump to hand, ruff a club, diamond to the king and ruff his last club|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: surely @d's will give you 3 tricks, @s's are favour of giving you 4(maybe 5 on the ruff potential of @c), if @h finesse is working you have 2@h tricks, and 1 in @c|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  a popular convention out here is called Rosenberg...over 2N, N would show the number of @ss and also min. or max. hand for the bidding|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: Stabell who won this last year, is having a good comeback this session, the team have made one change from last years team, and that is Boye Brogeland in and Tommy Sandsmark out.|pg||
nt|andyv:  with a 5 loser hand and a good 6 card suit, 4@s seems reasonable|pg||
nt|newmoon: rehi    lost conn|pg||
nt|andyv:  re|pg||
nt|Vugraphzem: Sandsmark played in the team as well  just not in the final|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|newmoon: I must say I prefer the negative free bid.   North can then bid a non-forcing 2@D over 1@S|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|varange: I don't mind the bid though |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|STRIK3R: as the cards lay, E/W will make 3NT, but will not bid it|pg||

nt|newmoon: who dealt this one?|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 boards in about 68 minutes|pg||
nt|andyv:  S|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: bd 6:  another 13 to Eber when they stopped out of the slam|pg||
nt|newmoon: an amazing stop|pg||
mb|1C|nt|newmoon: I mean... look at the @S stacks|pg||
nt|andyv:  N bid 4@s in this position in OR and got doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  the hand looks more like a 3@s bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, 1@s bid followed by 3@s|pg||
nt|newmoon: with 2 aces?    I prefer 1@S then 3@S, or 4@S I must admit|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|newmoon: in the OR 1@D was a transfer showing @Hs, and 3@H after that showed 4@Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  aha, followed my first suggestion (which was retracted...lol)|pg||
nt|newmoon: hee hee|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  N will play 3 rounds of @ds and ruff then just exit and wait|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|newmoon: OR started with this board, and I was there.   Jumped to this room when we found that they had 82 commentators|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  oops|pg||
pc|c2|nt|newmoon: the OR went only -2 in 4@Sx...  strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she thought spades were 3-2?  :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|newmoon: a real tough 3NT, as long as the 1st @H is ducked, u have a chance|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops.   now timing is out... u needed to play @Ss twice from dummy|pg||
nt|newmoon: and only ONE entry remains|pg||
nt|newmoon: maybe @D6 by East can be construed as a lavinthal signal?   and @D10 would show @S-strength|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|c5|nt|baldjean: But 9 tricks are not enough|pg||
nt|baldjean: 8, I meant|pg||
nt|newmoon: pity.  having escaled a @H lead, declarer should GRAB the @DA at tr 1 and play a @S.  If @SA is offside, you can always try a @H to the king later|pg||

nt|newmoon: website for bulletins and updates:   www.sabf.co.za/nationals/|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: last hand of 1st segment.   there will be a hospitality break of 20 minutes, then we resume with boards 13-24|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Roz, our excellent operator in Cape Town, well done again!|pg||
nt|andyv:  even this game can make|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: And to our fine commenters, Andy and Sid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  thank you Roland for inviting me, and thanks to Sid, Roz and all the specs who make this game so much fun.|pg||
nt|newmoon: GIB and Deep Finesse will mark this as a 4@H contract, but in real life, a tough one|pg||
nt|andyv:  in real life you lead the J@h off dummy,  N will play low and you play for 2-2 @hs|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx Roland, and thx Bridgebase for allowing us all to be in beautiful C.T. watching|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N happens to cover, then you can go back and finesse for the 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, as spec pointed out....very few entries|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2@D = @H raise, presumably|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like it...probably a constructive raise and 2@h would be a weak one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need the hand records to get trumps right|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: You are also short of entries|pg||
pc|d4|nt|newmoon: as Andy mentioned, entries are limited.  |pg||
nt|andyv:  and you need to finangle an extra entry to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North can deny access to dummy more than once by ducking this|pg||
pc|dT|nt|baldjean: brb|pg||
nt|andyv:  also, let's not forget the @s suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: He will cash AK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||

pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Normal play anyway|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h6|nt|newmoon: interesting - without that lead, would declarer have played ace and another?      Quite possible for opener (West) to have a stiff honour or any 2-2|pg||
