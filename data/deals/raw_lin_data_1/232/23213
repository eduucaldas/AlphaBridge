nt|clinch: Which will push them to 6@c|pg||
nt|othered1: Is it likely you want to fish for a 4-4 fit at the 5-level?|pg||
nt|othered1: Simply showing "transferrable values" seems to be best use and let partner judge|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: TD called (I'm not sure why)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Whome to fish for that Ed? N?|pg||
nt|clinch: So far Liggins has closed the gap to 17, with gains on 26 and 27 - a likely loss on 28 though|pg||
nt|othered1: No, I was commenting on the idea that north strongly implied @H length in an auction that was so crowded.|pg||
nt|clinch: Double here surely the most likely bid of N|pg||
nt|clinch: If Robson wants to take that out, can bid 4NT|pg||
nt|othered1: since pass would not be forc ing here, north has to do something to indicate the 2-way values|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would not say "strongly implied". but what other fits can S be hoping for? is a @c fit more likely?|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally like 4N, to make sure my actual @C length is clear to south.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Don't N show 3 in @H then Peter?|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|clinch: A fairly tame final board, it seems - Liggins will need to decide whether to fight on from about 30 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: Give me a photo and I will tell u:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Again a might horrible bid from S|pg||
nt|dburn: Robson very keen on directing leads, even at the expense of some risk|pg||
nt|rodal f: As now|pg||
nt|dburn: here, he might go for 800, but that is not a huge loss|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: 14-16 1NT, I think|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, everyone has to pass yet - not so obvious for Green to do that|pg||
nt|rodal f: As I said before, when NS did the same. IMPs run, but they have a confortable lead.|pg||
nt|clinch: Is it possible to hear the thud of a double behind screens?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: not sure who is thinking. Allfrey and Green are behind the screen|pg||
nt|rmb1: It is more obvious if you stand on your chair|pg||
nt|dburn: would be surprised if Allfrey was considering doing anything|pg||
nt|clinch: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: unless it's 2@s, lead-directing, of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|clinch: If double was penalty, I don't see the point of 3NT - Holland can also see the vulnerability|pg||
