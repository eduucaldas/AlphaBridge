nt|dburn: I can't see anything he can do, but he has to try to think of some way to make now he knows for sure hearts are 6-1|pg||
nt|ady: the initially could ruff 2 diamonds in hand and pick up the likely spade length with east   but  the heart distribution  wrecks it|pg||
nt|eggy:  I think he has to hope that East is 2623 I think|pg||

nt|mdgraham: what on earth is a quantum merit?|pg||
nt|eggy:  You have to be a surveyor Mike :)|pg||
nt|ady: slam possibilities first hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: 6@S  can be down immediately  with a heart ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: better to play in hearts, but may get locked into spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzdq: They're playing this board upside down, so names ar reversed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|eggy:  But I think it's fair to say that it is apretty moderate contract anyway|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: 6@h is fine|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ady: better chances in hearts  as diamonds may come in to avoice spade guess|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|mdgraham: may find A+Qt missing and stop in five|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|dburn: that's slightly problematic on a club lead - if you ruff a diamond before playing a heart, the defence may get a diamond ruff when in with @hA|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  likely to go down even without the heart lead|pg||
nt|dburn: but Matheson has done well to suggest hearts as a contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing in the solid suit|pg||
nt|ady: yes    good judgement|pg||
nt|dburn: and Coyle should be happy to accept - but he may think it is some obscure grand slam try|pg||
nt|dburn: not that Matheson would ever make one of those, but...|pg||
nt|eggy:  Is there any reason for Coyle to remove it? - I don;t think so do you?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: Other way round actually (for this board)|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, OK - then Coyle would also never make one of those|pg||
nt|dburn: since there were plenty of non-obscure gand slam tries available|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there's always that jump to 3@s to consider, though|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|ady: in hearts declarer will be able to find that south has 5 diamonds   and north 4 hearts    but still will not have a really good count|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: Liggins (who is really North) might not lead @hA - @cK more likely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: clue in the Times Jumbo |pg||
nt|ady: this likely to fail|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, priv|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: but Matheson (who is really West) may well get spades wrong|pg||
nt|eggy:  I suppose that you would normally play S for the SQ but I am not sure you can easily make this with spades 4-1 anyway can you?|pg||
nt|dburn: no, not easily at all|pg||
nt|eggy:  perhaps using hearts as surrogate trumps?|pg||
nt|dburn: normally, you would play the king first because you can succeed against @sQ9xx with South and not with North|pg||
nt|dburn: but if you do that, you may end up killing the heart suit|pg||
nt|eggy:  ar perhaps a first round to the J to allow for S9 single with S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the sort of hand you want for the first board|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|dburn: this match will be played in four sets of eight boards, so we start with 7 and 8 here to get comparisons from 1-6 at the other table|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: maybe better first than very late   at least a chance to recover if getting itwrong|pg||

nt|ahollan1: walter  while u had connection trouble  i asked    in RKC Queen ask sequence  how does responder show Q + 2 outside kings?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i forgot  meckwell were burned by the auto trump lead a couple of years ago|pg||
