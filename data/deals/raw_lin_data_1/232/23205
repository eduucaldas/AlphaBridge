mb|1H|nt|athene: many top pairs play slightly different methods here than casual players|pg||
nt|athene: after the nebulous club gets overcalled|pg||
nt|athene: they play 1@S is t/o without spades|pg||
nt|bebechira: Tony Forrester here http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=8909|pg||
nt|athene: some play x = 4 or 5 spades and with 6+ spades they have specialized higher bids|pg||
nt|athene: some just play x = 4+ spades|pg||
mb|2D|an|6 spades|mb|3S!|mb|4H!|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 3.5 @D -- what's the problem?|pg||
nt|mamos:  whatever North does  East seems likely to jump in Hearts|pg||
nt|athene: gold's splinter might look aggressive but he anticipates that NS are going to be bidding a lot of spades, so he wants to tell his partner he has a singleton, to help him judge how ...|pg||
nt|athene: high to go|pg||
nt|athene: for example if forrester has a small doubleton spade, then knowing gold has a singleton might be the key to a successful 5@H-over-4@S decision|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow  i did not see 2@S in the list of options|pg||
mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|athene: north's pass of 4@HX was probably more encouraging than 4@S would have been |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but as cards lie   4@S does make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: not sure he really wanted to encourage, with that hand, though - maybe some misunderstanding|pg||
nt|athene: his one control is worthless facing short hearts|pg||
nt|athene: queens and jacks and no singletons are not a winning recipe for the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he simply passed 4@HX so his partner could play it in 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: that might be necessary sometimes if his partner has (say) @DKx that needs protecting on opening lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: with EW not bidding  unlikely that Lee is 3541  so Demirev expects 2542|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky  he had found a route to great result|pg||

nt|athene: but was that ever necessary?|pg||

nt|athene: yes the obvious play here is to unblock the @CA and take the diamond finesse, and that will lead to a lot of tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but the trouble is if the @DQ is offside you are in a lot of trouble|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: stongly suspect delay was  what to do AFTER  obligatory @H finesse|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Garner stops in 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 73  Nickell still leads Milner by 79|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: Jan Martel just announced   IFF concessions in both matches, Director will give option to start final this afternoon -- but doubt the other match will concede|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell leads Milner by 76|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: he'll cash the @SA first just in case there is a spade-diamond squeeze|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: (four diamonds with the @SKQ)|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|h5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ritong: keeps the @s route and speeds things up if they split 3/3|pg||
nt|athene: best defence is to throw your @D10 and @D9 away fast so he can claim|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: round 6 scheduled to begin in about 20   but you never know|pg||

mb|3D|nt|athene: not sure why forrester didn't open 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: but he probably had his reasons|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: @hKJ10 is a big flaw|pg||
nt|mamos:  maybe he thought  too strong |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mamos:  4@s?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mcphee: this could go down a lot on a trump shift|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzff: thanks to the great commentators... Al and Walter... you guys are the best!!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: just a matter of entries as much as anything i suppose|pg||

nt|mamos:  I dont think EW can be proud of their auction even if 4@S  was very lucky 5@D is horrid |pg||
nt|athene: he would surely have bid 4@S over 3@S with as much as @Sxx or singleton @SK|pg||

nt|ritong: i am asked why @hKJ10 is a flaw  two reasons  1) it constitutes a defensive holding pard will not expect and 2) it buries @hs, even if pard has like AQxxxx(x)|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: nasty choice for E if Allfrey had opened 1@S, but he has opened a 15-17 NT instead|pg||

nt|athene: if you argue that he would pass the double with good HCP, this has to show long diamonds but not a great hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: last board of the set now|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|d6|pc|sA|pc|cJ|pg||
