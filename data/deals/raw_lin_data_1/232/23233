nt|athene: NS don't have a single point wasted in fact|pg||

nt|runnerup:  this time 4 @s is anly 300 but you lose in a long run if you bid those -because in all cases ns aren't aware what they do and 3nt can go down|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a double for takeout by north if available would have worked well|pg||

nt|athene: over a normal weak-two opener by opponents, a jump overcall is strong e.g. (2@D) 3@H|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|athene: did the diamonds really go like that? seems odd|pg||
nt|danilo1: so ... @D 3-3 is not the chance|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: so you could argue that double then bidding a suit doesn't show a hand that definitely wants to commit to that suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Baard Olav Aasan|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello all|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gsper:  Andy, the ambiguous nature of 2@D complicated it for N|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: but all that is a bit tenuous|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: now declarer can only get one diamond ruff but north gets squeezed in diamonds and spades|pg||

nt|mdgraham: two off with the spade misguess - but it was never making|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we all know the feeling - we are quite happy, until the result of the first board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then it all goes downhill |pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: defence went plus, but it might have gone better|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D=majors|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  should make on the lay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|gsper:  1NT 12-14, often offshape|pg||
nt|athene: when south bids 3@H with only six he has to have some shape i think|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe declarer should have played for 4-1 spades, but not easy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do i collect the 1085 cokes|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2x120 good start for both|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: maybe can block the diamonds and survive|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Transfer, of course. E was doing the thinking|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: i prefer 2@C for that purpose, as partner can bid 2@D with no preference|pg||
nt|athene: interesting, he doesn't go 4@H|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt ew here and if something /else ) happens -it is a suprice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with opening 4@H is that if opps bid 4@S or 5@C over it, as they very likely will, you are left not knowing what to do|pg||
nt|athene: you would probably be tempted to bid 5@D as partner will never imagine what you have|pg||

mb|4D|nt|athene: however, the way it has gone, he has hardly shown his hand either|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this auction would show extras for me, and for sure that double was penalty|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello CK and wlc.|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think just bidding 4 right away with north is reasonable|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not see how South can know what is useful and what is not.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might have a club slam opposite suitable cards, but it's shooting for the moon a bit - 3NT is practical |pg||
nt|athene: might be 4@H or 4@D for them|pg||
nt|tez: @h dönüþü dýþýndakiler kayýp|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: on a club attack declarer might have to overtake in spades to get a fast pitch from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know what the redouble was|pg||
nt|athene: and i can't believe angelini did either|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe if the auction had tempoed out differently he would have bid - for example if west made some raise and then east bid 4@S and that was passed round to him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if the @s10 forces the king the defence would need an immediate diamond switch|pg||
nt|athene: so losing one heart, one diamond, and one club|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks like -1|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sharkey: perhaps being NV was a factor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let's hope we are guessing well|pg||
nt|athene: on any other lead he can happily unblock the @SK as he has time to build an entry to his @SAQ, so plus one|pg||

nt|fabsayc: maybe but could be some fantoni magic|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: another problem on defense for west, succeeds if he clears the spades, but also must unguard the diamonds later|pg||
nt|athene: but as it went, bidding 5@D in front of his partner is a bit of a gamble|pg||
nt|athene: of course, passing is a big gamble too|pg||

pc|d9|nt|athene: lanzarotti obviously takes 2@S as showing a very weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: the immediate bid after the redouble|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems like a heart would have been killing|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H lead for 2 down, but now it has a chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it can make|pg||
nt|kemperg: will get the @Ds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: I guess N could double 3@d with a good(ish) hand |pg||
nt|athene: you might say "well, obviously north must be broke, after the opponents have both shown decent hands"|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be a bit worried here; only 8 obvious tricks even with the club finesse working|pg||
nt|psyck: I like dbl of the options|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C just makes but 3@S could be for -500|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cc does not cover this auction, anybody know what 3@C is?|pg||
nt|queequeg: Open Room http://td.bboitalia.it/30.jpg|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will Sementa lead a low heart or the J :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about this - 2@c may be Gazzilli |pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS are too balanced, but it's hard for either side to realise this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzers (some of them) say 3@C asks for 4 card major or 5 card minor, 3d denies|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not many pairs include 5-card majors in the weak NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since i got at least 4 versions i am more confused than before :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe the have no choice with less than 14 pts|pg||
nt|baardolav: A endplay in @d / @h probably?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobholl: @c queen is a nice card but not shown|pg||
nt|athene: well, no 4@C, so madala knows they are off the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: they'll play six, though, i would think|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2NT said he liked clubs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: 5@D might make|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have a great hand for clubs in that context|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: oh well :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@h not very good needs @C 32 and king rigth most times|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, if you work out what partner has by trusting your opponents, then you get talked out of games when west has psyched the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: beautiful venue indeed|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: but the spades are blocked so he can play on diamonds successfully|pg||
nt|athene: i think if 5@C was there, west would have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did E se 4@C as foricng?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: need to be cautious    even 5 level could be too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody ever won at bridge by trusting the opponents|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't think Sementa would compete to 3 level with a 4333 hand, but it works fine here|pg||
nt|baardolav: he can raise the diamonds yes... because versace do now have any spades left|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: so having agreements with partner is a better way to go, what with him being on your side|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time.....|pg||
nt|athene: south can see declarer is all set to throw hearts on spades, so might as well attack hearts now?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C obviously something showing a good hand, maybe showing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on;y blocked if he wins this :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing king looks the odds play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: lead was @S9 showing bad suit|pg||

nt|mdgraham: wonder if the @S4 had any significance|pg||

pc|h9|nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|athene: if trumps are clubs are 3-2, you don't need the @CK right, do you? just lose club, ruff clubs good|pg||
nt|athene: *if trumps AND clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|athene: because you can cash clubs and get the heart through as well|pg||
nt|athene: partner having the @HK is not in itself enough; even if you cash some hearts, declarer can throw enough clubs on spades|pg||

nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to ruff a club and pick up trumps, losing just one spade, two diamonds and the @CA|pg||
nt|psyck: to prevent losing 2 trump tricks via @c ruff on a bad day...|pg||
nt|athene: well 3@S can be beaten with diamond ruff and then club shift i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't draw trumps and then get back to dummy fast to throw his club losers on the two good diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: neither do I but else why E bids 5@C:)|pg||
nt|tez: biraz az ama mantýklý 3 nt idi|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  making n/s   but an excellent save for e/w in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
nt|athene: but if west led a spade, east could win the @CA and return a diamond and then throw two clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer could never get to dummy as east could overruff with the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all irrelevant anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or just a club lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 @c ok -here -4 @h makes ..so |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, essentially 3@C was modified puppet stayman|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some 9 in @h ew if opened and will |pg||
nt|athene: 5@D might come home but 4@C tick would have been a reasonable place to stop i think|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@C NOT precision style, though it looks that way|pg||
nt|psyck: Right Bill, which is why I guess Markku said better chances played by N|pg||

nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sing @s makes it ofcause dangerous to open 4. hand|pg||
nt|athene: well sort of double fit :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  mainly that and west will lead @h Q --normally -@c lead only after peeping|pg||
nt|athene: many would just raise clubs with east, but sementa obviously feels that with opps bidding hearts, it is worth a lot for your side to find spades, rather than clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: south will have trouble showing hand now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will pay to stop low here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like a direct 3@D invite, although the bid has several flaws|pg||
nt|psyck: 2C = 10-13 value, 5C-4other unbalanced, or 6+C|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D relay asking for 3-card major|pg||
nt|psyck: N's hand becomes powerful with Aces in pd's suit now|pg||
nt|athene: angelini can't bid less than game now, can he? ace in both partner's suits for a single raise|pg||
nt|athene: transfer responses, so 1@S shows diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  3. hands pass -was a view =suprice also|pg||
nt|kemperg: good 5@D rescue, red against green:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  2NT relay again|pg||
nt|athene: ok, apparently he can|pg||
nt|athene: east might balance now with a double|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last makeble bid NS 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could have responded 2@d, perhaps, but that may be FG, and S isn't quite strong enough for that (non strong-club opener)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry but don't have a CC for NS|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tactical 3 @h to play in 4 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and EW just make 2@S imo|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: ah a spec suggests north is "she" - i was assuming a different angelini haha|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 now -but ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: everyone has shown his hand fairly, except N who should have bid stronger|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand why west bids spades rather than hearts, but it sure worked out|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is FG|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D response were not GF you might bid a spade anyway so as not to lose the suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2000 |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h showed 3-4 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d showed 1345|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought the redouble might give EW a better chance to find the right major, if west could pass and let east bid spades|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  200 -500 with x|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so north was weaker than i would have been |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||

nt|psyck: they have some defense, may not be all that clear to bid 5@c, though it is very likely they will bid it as insurance at this vul|pg||
nt|jaapfr: XX and 3@C and 3@D do mean: pls opps go to an unmakebele level:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now semanta must guess spade finesse or more diamonds|pg||
nt|danilo1: next "easy" 3NT ... but with @H wide opened ... after testing @C 3-3 (ending in dummy) ... Sementa may see better chance in @S finess than the risk to loose 3 @D tricks|pg||

pc|cA|nt|runnerup:   at least you get + score there -2 aces -and|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what north was worried about - pushing opps into 5@C making - but that is not a big danger when you have two aces and partner opened|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: it looks as though west bid 2@S because he assumed opps would compete further and then he could show hearts|pg||
pc|c5|nt|runnerup:  norths|pg||
nt|athene: but why is he so anxious to bid 3 over 3?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as you said earlier about 2@S bid|pg||

nt|mdgraham: sry, CC not clear about 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3M would be a singleton or void|pg||

nt|mdgraham: sry, misread the CC. 1NT can include a 4441 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: EW's 1nt has to cover a lot of hands unsuitable for other bids, sort of like a precision 1@D|pg||

nt|mdgraham: told 3@c asks for 5M or 5422 shape|pg||

nt|athene: he's wondering whether to overtake this, ruff the last heart, then play a small club |pg||
pc|h4|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: EW might have 4@D, at this rate|pg||

nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||

nt|psyck: non vul, @h sequence, some shape & values on the side, a clear 3@h bid|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|athene: well as i said it is difficult - you might just bid 3nt |pg||
nt|psyck: same i suppose dbl planning 3N on 3M|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but if partner bid lets say 4 @c ?|pg||
nt|athene: you might double but that will often just give you a hard problem later on|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: 4nt with @D lead can create big problems so better 5@C for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: one can not develop both majors with @D lead so if @D lead doomed|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: ok i'm told 3@D was a 5-card minor, 3@H asked, 3@S showed clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 3@H was equivalent of jump after 2@D response|pg||

nt|jaapfr: i really miss why to lead @H as W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with a less solid suit he would pass or double|pg||
nt|danilo1: opps, Danger now ... guess Toni bid too much with 5NT |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: endplay coming up....draw trumps in 2, ruff the spade, exit diamond|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gsper:  Therefore the double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but this looks like one too many cue bids to me|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Have East denied @DK?|pg||
nt|danilo1: yes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sharkey: Should make now|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can duck this|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: yes, duck this looks simplest, then just draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need to guess the hearts or anything|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West did not think so|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: 4@Sx by north in open room|pg||
nt|psridhar:  Versace possibly judged it wd be -1 at most , no x|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: if you draw trumps you don't have a dummy entry, but when you lead the @H10, east has a tricky decision |pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: you might have started with @HA10 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: now the double squeeze is pretty much marked|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: cash @CK, ruff a heart, and then run the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and whoever has the diamonds will have to unguard them|pg||
nt|athene: not actually a double squeeze as only one person can guard them but that is how you play it|pg||
nt|psyck: well we don't get dealt such 24 everyday, so i don't like to just bid 3N, I will x & take my medicine on pd's rebid|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south has 3 @h normally|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|athene: wondering whether to overtake and lead a club up|pg||
nt|athene: if you play low here and then another heart, east has to win and play a small diamond to give you a problem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sanki yapar gibi idi ama batara gelmiþ|pg||

nt|psridhar:  this Bd shd be a flat @s game making|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: only @DA as an obvious loser, as you can throw a diamond on the @SK|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: but if you draw trumps you only have 11 tricks with crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: i think north ought to be raising clubs if her partner can bid them twice|pg||
nt|baardolav: Too conservative not double... I think. you pay 590 one out of 7 times but that is 4 imps only...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, opposite vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt scramble now, perhaps|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW were thoroughly preempted out|pg||
nt|psyck: made it difficult for EW to enter at this vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  not a good start for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 450 modest consolation|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
nt|danilo1: small @D now?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: but it still costs an imp |pg||
nt|athene: maybe west comes under pressure, having to guard both majors, and you can ruff the @HK or @S10 good|pg||
nt|gsper:  A D by E risked 4 or 5@C from partner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D was obviously something weird - maybe showed just a minimum hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this lead stops 6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  under 6 @c you can stay with good justment|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cant|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: ý have no idea about website|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if declarer plays hearts early   should make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if NS's agreement is that 2nt here is lebensohl or a scramble|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in italy most doubles suggest a desire to compete further, even after the fit has been found|pg||
nt|tez: 2 nt neymiþ ümit?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you play it as scramble you can use it, like this, to show a weak 3@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: (direct 3@H bid is stronger)|pg||
nt|athene: of course if that is what the double meant then it is easy for south to bid on|pg||

pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: güneydeki oyuncu bu durumda mutlu olmalý sanýrým|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will be 2 or 3 down now - good defence|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no way the defence can set themselves up some long hearts|pg||

nt|nilsland:  up to now ;)|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: if the double shows 4+ spades, then north might want to raise just because of the big fit, but he doesn't want to suggest he has anything|pg||

nt|athene: north might get endplayed in 3@C, for example heart lead ruffed, draw trumps, then play a spade|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|athene: east really bid 2@D? is this a 2-way bid, maybe weak spade raise or some strong options?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yy 5@H does make with @S @S lead kibs:)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|athene: maybe a better plan was to cash the @DA at trick 2, then return the heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice to see that even Fantunes can err occasionally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner started with @DKx he can cash the @DK before giving you the heart ruff, and you can give him a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no need to underlead your @DA trying to pick up @DQxx with declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt =dd and down in practive if no helping bids in defence (like here) perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so we see lauria's opinion of the tricky bidding problem for balanced 24 count after 3@H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: might very well get the clubs right - we shall see|pg||
nt|athene: he doubled and basically forced to 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lucky 6 @s for bear card bid and made quite lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  25 to 7=32 now we surely will see a slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  Facing a passed pd Aluf doesnt fancy 4@s and fancies defending 1N|pg||
nt|psridhar:  hence that pass of 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West might have passed - six spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might deem it unsuitable for a weak two |pg||
nt|gsper:  E has a lot of cards but does not know where to go|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gsper:  And knows even less now|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would bid 3NT now and go down|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s maybe...|pg||
nt|athene: defence have to be slightly careful here to cash out the diamonds and not for example try to cash two hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: the systematic 2@D bid did S pass else he could bid and NS in a @H contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: clever action|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another failing 7 perhaps|pg||
nt|danilo1: hopefully only 6 this time :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We dont have any system notes. Has East showed @C+@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think so but just a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am told, on the NS methods, if south WAS 4333, he would be 18-20, so that was out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i never see in table any one to finess @c -not expected here |pg||
nt|athene: west tries to conceal the position in clubs|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2@H was natural or 22-24 bal|pg||
nt|psridhar:  if sittng birds are to be shot.....|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR is behind us, so no scores|pg||
nt|psridhar:  and rarely u get to shoot Lauria's contract !|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gsper:  Opposite an overcall, Hedy?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: 6 either major makes with spades friendly.|pg||
nt|athene: so the defence don't realise the urgency to cash out in diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: very good slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  clever it may hv been but NS can make 2@s and the upshot could well be -2 imps|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kickard, love it|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 6@H is a bit better than 6@S because you might make it even with a bad spade break, but it's hard to get out of a 4-4 fit once you lock into it|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play 9@H now only down chance |pg||
pc|s4|nt|nilsland:  sry 24+ bal|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C looks like nat (@C support) and slam interest|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: Yes, diamonds might produce an extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: so the underlead looks like a definite slip|pg||
nt|psyck: well, i did guess E would bid @s, just misguessed the number|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nilsland:  but I do not know more|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Your guesses is as good as mine (or better)|pg||
nt|danilo1: and 4NT is probably @D cue ...so Sementa asks for third round control in @H now I thk|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either way looks a shakey auction|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... but he may get third round @S control :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @S Q so 6 only|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if 2@S is 5/5, he knows W has diamonds - straw in the wind perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: from N point of vieuw a singleton @H is only chance but lauria wouldn't have covered|pg||
nt|psridhar:  unless Aluf has guts to shift to @H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psridhar:  and not cash his pd's Ace|pg||

nt|kareno: 5@h may show two without trump queen.|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should have taken control with blackwood over 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: normally you don't want the limited hand as captain|pg||
nt|athene: east just wants to know if her partner has @SAQ, @HA, @DA - then 7 is good|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: There's no safety play in the spade suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c - so old hat these days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be a very expensive @d7 discard|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: west can never know if 7 is good because he does not know his partner has six solid hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @S2 to K and club finesse?|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are criticizing 3@H, a bit unfairly I think|pg||
nt|gsper:  Considering the alternatives|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Again|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... 5NT is not the luckiest bid for EW|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Later today there will be some systemic discussion - in Italian....|pg||
nt|psridhar:  udca?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gsper:  3@H is not good, but what else is?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: some specs are suggesting that if west wants to give the impression he has no club honour in hand, the jack was a better card to play|pg||

nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|runnerup:  are we aware about situation|pg||

nt|runnerup:  maybe west bid 2 @s -yes looks better|pg||
nt|psridhar:  no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east must have thought 2@S was a relay and west thought it was natural by a passed hand|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@h=10-13, 5+@h|pg||

nt|gsper:  What on Earth is going on here?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: if they wake up and bid a cold 4@S you just hope that your teammate are in it anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now south might discover a diamond suit tucked away there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cc says 2@s=realy, but maybe that doesn't apply by a passed hand  |pg||
nt|athene: if partner asks you for non-spade suits and you have seven in one of them, you might want to bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s presumably some sort of fit-jump|pg||
nt|psyck: are we looking at the same boards :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  It is suggested that thay are playing board 29|pg||

nt|runnerup:  this is not gonna make :) .heh heh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think W playing 3@d on a 3-2 fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a bright kib said better W bidding 2@H and then 3@H (for the ones who see 3@H as 5/5m)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't know what 3@C means but i have no doubt they will bid 6@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: my guess is 3@H no major 4@D is choose anyway|pg||

pc|hT|nt|athene: double 3@C looks normal with west but this will work out fine anyway|pg||

nt|athene: might be a problem now if north passes after a looong think, and south finds 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|gsper:  But even then 3@D is not obvious|pg||
nt|psyck: if so 3@d @c single (with 3@h @d single & 3@s @s single)?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Quite possibly|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead you might well need five diamond tricks so small to the queen is right, isn't it? gains against @DKx onside or @Dxx as here|pg||
nt|athene: @DKx or @DKxx|pg||
nt|ritong: down two, seems|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even if North is known to have slow-passed, 5@d isn't unreasonable with 7411 shape|pg||
