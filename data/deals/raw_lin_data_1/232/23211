nt|bebechira: Tony Forrester here http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=8909|pg||
nt|athene: some play x = 4 or 5 spades and with 6+ spades they have specialized higher bids|pg||
nt|athene: some just play x = 4+ spades|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D|an|Hearts|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3.5 @D -- what's the problem?|pg||
nt|mamos:  whatever North does  East seems likely to jump in Hearts|pg||
nt|athene: gold's splinter might look aggressive but he anticipates that NS are going to be bidding a lot of spades, so he wants to tell his partner he has a singleton, to help him judge how ...|pg||
nt|athene: high to go|pg||
nt|athene: for example if forrester has a small doubleton spade, then knowing gold has a singleton might be the key to a successful 5@H-over-4@S decision|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow  i did not see 2@S in the list of options|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north's pass of 4@HX was probably more encouraging than 4@S would have been |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: but as cards lie   4@S does make|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: not sure he really wanted to encourage, with that hand, though - maybe some misunderstanding|pg||
nt|athene: his one control is worthless facing short hearts|pg||
nt|athene: queens and jacks and no singletons are not a winning recipe for the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he simply passed 4@HX so his partner could play it in 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: that might be necessary sometimes if his partner has (say) @DKx that needs protecting on opening lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: with EW not bidding  unlikely that Lee is 3541  so Demirev expects 2542|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky  he had found a route to great result|pg||

nt|athene: but was that ever necessary?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer was known to have only six trumps|pg||

nt|mamos:  I dont think EW can be proud of their auction even if 4@S  was very lucky 5@D is horrid |pg||
