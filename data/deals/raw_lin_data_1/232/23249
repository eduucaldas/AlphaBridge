nt|bobh1: starting off with a slam|pg||

mb|3N|nt|bigtrain: what happened with the scoring?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|3for3: Is this the correct score?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: henry do you have any idea how this score was handled?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bigtrain: W is squeezed in 3 suits|pg||
pc|s5|nt|3for3: It was tied on vugraph after 105, but that is unofficial|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: seems unlikely, unless there was some massive adjustment on appeal|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfk: didnt get bidding sry|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzfk: appeal changed to 2HXX down 1|pg||
nt|3for3: so, shouldnt that mean nickell leads?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but that should mean nickell is leading|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it should|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: ibelieve that nickell is up 11 or 12|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think the score is reversed here|pg||
nt|3for3: there was a differing explanation on an alertable call, and the ruling changed the score from plus 300 for spector, to 200 for nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: i believe that is correct but I will try to change score in a minute|pg||
nt|dburn: but this looks like a losing position for Nickell - 3NT would have made, but 5@c almost certainly will not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is the score  heard|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: his hand falls apart on the barage of diamonds before that happens|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: Play is at tric 9..i will report result in a min|pg||
nt|3for3: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the problem was in the open room they cashed the hearts and lost communication for the squeeze to work|pg||
nt|3for3: seems like that adjustment should be 12, not 21...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bigtrain: has to pitch 5 cards|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|bebechira: yes :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll bet 3@S was spades and a minor  |pg||
nt|bebechira: and it will be costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: not an easy game|pg||
nt|nightbell: Cashing AKQ@s and AK@d i think makes the contract since NS Lost comunication on@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: they let @H block :)|pg||

nt|athene: but that is a bit of a forlorn hope if rodwell really has his 16 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: 3nt here]|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|barnets:  here 5 major the limit again with clubs lying well|pg||
nt|athene: EW can survive 5@S here although it shouldn't come to that|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  1@C strong of course, 2@C positive I presume with long clubs|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@H from grue, double from meckstroth|pg||
nt|athene: lots of suggestions for Grue here|pg||
nt|barnets:  should he bid 4@H east may x and west 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sorry lost connect contracr was 4s w making 7|pg||
nt|barnets:  the third in hand opener is quite normal for any of these guys|pg||
nt|athene: making 7? that's a lot|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: hamman has support but not enough values for a direct raise|pg||
nt|algraves:  forcing NT, one of the hand types is a weak heart raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Al is right that the lack of aces and kings is a negative factor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = natural GF|pg||
nt|ady: last hand   several kibs suggest east ducks 2nd heart    will give declarer some problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have been @D & @H    not sure if 1@D also show both|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: nice trump support|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@D key card in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suspect just @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: how about france?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 33% of that|pg||
nt|3for3: spade to queen|pg||
nt|3for3: club hook|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bigtrain: were they french?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: hurd is 4333 but with prime high cards|pg||
nt|ady: 4NT?|pg||
nt|algraves:  2 key cards, no Queen of @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sry we are having internet problems|pg||
nt|algraves:  well then do away with the invitational raise if that is the position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's 2@H walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = @S raise|pg||
nt|bigtrain: versace and lauria|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|algraves:  if the club is in your bag then at some point you should use it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  3@H limit of better in principle|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thts helpful...  you can't go south  ;)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bobh1: declarer's problem is more a death of tricks than the bad trump break|pg||
nt|algraves:  Grand slam try asking more information|pg||
nt|algraves:  so Cheek, knows that his partner has neither Major King|pg||
nt|ady: maybe some sort of asking bid in diamonds?|pg||
nt|algraves:  6 imps is not cheap|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C= natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3@D = Q|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to push if the result from the open room is correct|pg||
nt|3for3: that is a very good hand for a 15-17 nt|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bigtrain: colan|pg||
nt|3for3: 3nt down in other room i am told|pg||
nt|dburn: it is, but what could you do? open 1@c and rebid 2NT?|pg||
nt|3for3: so, spector back in the lead|pg||
nt|3for3: that is what i'd do|pg||
nt|3for3: oh, my spies misinformedme!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: but i think he can manage|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  no ! assume more key card, ie asking for informatino|pg||
nt|algraves:  I suspect 5NT showed interest as he could have bid 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: 5d asked for kings|pg||
nt|algraves:  So this showed the Kick back method of asking for Key cards, ie one above agreed trumps to advantage|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT down? not according to this|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  So well done|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2:  No, but it can be set|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mesbur-Fitzgibbons??|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, it would go about four down on a heart lead, but...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2:  heart, spade back|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobh1: kibs are taking both sides of this one|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: Zia @C play is not popular with the naysayers|pg||
nt|algraves:  easier when you can see all 4 hands and are in the back row|pg||
nt|bobh1: of course we can all see much more of the deal than Zia can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but that is the kibitizers long held right|pg||
nt|algraves:  without Oscar the Owl the game would be poorer|pg||
nt|bobh1: Zia plays MUD it appears|pg||
nt|bobh1: this may be a source of confusion for Joel|pg||
nt|bobh1: normally a player leading the 5 then playing the 9 would have the Q|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a timed event but long pauses for thought are normal and permitted|pg||
nt|bobh1: when they start to add up, the director starts getting nasty|pg||
nt|algraves:  Well Woldridge can build a club trick with the right view but that is hardly clear|pg||
nt|bobh1: no timers...if the table is slow, then we start arguing about whose fault it was|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  And you can deny declarer access to dummy to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bigtrain: he goggled the answer :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i couldn't stand the strain of waiting :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|danilo1: once Zia led @C (and not @HK), he is doing best to continue - and force declarer's @C decision immediatelly (he may have led from Q95(2)) ... after all, East did not Dble 4@S ... ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: and he is "known" to have probably @HQ (no @H lead) and 5 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: right walter|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: ...if anyone actually led a heart, his copy of the hand records should gently be removed from him before allowing play to continue|pg||
nt|3for3: i think meckwells nt range is 14-16 here, so clearer for him to upgrade|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no --  didn't use google|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: made only 2 on a bizarre line attempting to make 4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d4|mc|11|nt|algraves:  5 imps in this case|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|bebechira: they are bidding the 7NT hand now in the closed :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|hedyg: no support doubles over 1NT , would probably be penalty|pg||

mc|7|nt|mdgraham: some say support doubles are off over NT - doubles are penalties |pg||
nt|nightbell: 24 Imp in Boards 7 and 8 |pg||
nt|bebechira: we scored 8 boards and we exchanged 56 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: was fun - thanks all|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Mike, as i mentioned double would probably be penalty at this table.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Mike :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: cigarette :)|pg||

nt|santyclz: Congratulations!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Santy , still miss it though :(|pg||
nt|nightbell: playing bridge with an angry partner is just as deadly|pg||

nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|nightbell: Ionut, can you please update us on the other teams also when you know the results?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 4@s +1 instead of 7NT was worth 12 imps|pg||
nt|bebechira: thats a long break.... i wonder what the TD has to say|pg||
pg||
qx|c6|st||md|4S873H8D9543CAT875,SQ6HAJ943DJT82CQ9,SAT54HKQ52DQ7CKJ4,SKJ92HT76DAK6C632|sv|e|nt|bobh1: apparently he made it|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure exactly how :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe he just claimed and they conceeded|pg||
nt|algraves:  he played a second Club first of course|pg||
nt|algraves:  Always difficult to bid those type of grand slams because you can talk yourself into a conservative position|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: contract here is 3n by south|pg||
nt|athene: this might go (2@S) X 3@C lebensohl 3@H 3@S 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Sabine Auken and Paul Marston recommend that you lead from your four-card suit rather than from the five-bagger. They would have defeated it|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well if north bid 3@D rather than 3@C actually that is more likely|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the battle of the mjors coming up|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: n/s may get toohigh|pg||
nt|algraves:  requires partnership trust and \ or personal courage|pg||
nt|algraves:  so the loss on board 49 was 4 imps when Meckwell played 2@H making|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks in spades on the lay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: serving nother neb|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: south has a useful hand   decent spades with 2 outside aces|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 49 at other table, Jeff Meckstroth overcalled the Precision 1@D with 1@H, as his two small spades and likely (possible) spade lead or switch after short 1@D opener and his ...|pg||
nt|petergill: minimum values opposite passed hand made 1NT unattractive |pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets:  spector gained 10 imps on board 63 when n/s bid game here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
mb|2C|nt|algraves:  They have a way to invite in @S shoiwing 5|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this shows that hand|pg||
nt|algraves:  invitational with @S 5|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, next board for me to misanalyze|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets:  so the lead now is 65|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  I suspect we did not quite see the play correctly|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: well stopped|pg||
nt|algraves:  and he trusts his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd on Roland's list of terrible bridge terms|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: from declarer;s perspective..club length is unknown after 1d opener|pg||
nt|barnets: if declarer ducks a club east might shift to a spade and  may possibly set up one club 2 diamonds one heart and one spade trick for the defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  yes although that was not a minimum hand with two tens and 2 Aces, 2Kings and a working j|pg||
nt|algraves:  certinaly suited for play in Hearts though, the classic 4-3 fit type hand , strong trumps and prime cards outside|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: Yes. I think it was mostly the spade holding that deterred Meckstroth from 1NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  to facilitate ruffing in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: wd Meckstroth anyway|pg||
nt|3for3: no alert, but we can assume zias 3@C was preemptive/mixed|pg||
nt|dburn: luckily for Nickell, neither of those superb players is qualified to play in the US trials - still, there are doubtless some vacant properties still in Monaco|pg||
nt|3for3: this 3nt looks flat|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|ady: declarer will be pleased with the 9 tricks    not certain to make |pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzfk: not real bidding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks in OR   a good return|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll take the declarer|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bobh1: here's an auction and a defense we can all understand|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say he wins and plays a spade now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bigtrain: declarer can set up 3 spade winners (at least DD)|pg||
nt|barnets: now dec is a tempo ahead|pg||
nt|barnets: he may have gone wrong before|pg||
pc|cK|nt|algraves:  My Mom would bring this in, with her only consistent line of play|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm this is a bit interesting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wants to go over to dummy and finesse hearts to keep east off lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sry put contract i to follow play|pg||
nt|athene: but if he cashes the @DQ whilst he is there, he sets up diamond tricks and an entry for east|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: msy make 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: maybe he will now decide he has to just bash out hearts from the top|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really make use of the @h98|pg||
nt|athene: for example club to king, heart to jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Cheek thinking|pg||
nt|athene: because if that finesse lost, a club return would tangle your entries|pg||
nt|barnets:  he may x to dummy and lead the @H 8 to the J|pg||
nt|athene: yes, maybe you can do that, and then duck if west wins and shifts to a club|pg||
nt|barnets:  ibut a club retun hurts transport here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|algraves:  Hurd is a terrific player , dont get me wrong, but at some point.... as I said. It is a good debate when the stakes are 4-6 imps|pg||
pc|c5|nt|algraves:  which was to pull trump and take whatever finesses were about|pg||
nt|ady: a squeeze materialised on east|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|algraves:  on this hand there are none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe at this point he is regretting ducking the first trick as it gives him slightly less elbow-room for a throw-in ending|pg||
nt|athene: but he was not sure spades were 6-1, meckstroth being in first seat at favourable, i guess|pg||
nt|barnets:  he could duck it thouhgh|pg||
nt|bigtrain: briar patch|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=K9+J5+AK9+AJ9632  17.6 that last S hand, so Meckstroth was right to upgrade to a strong club|pg||
pc|h6|nt|algraves:  Grue is trying for some elimination so the the opps have to start @H|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|barnets:  and is ok|pg||
nt|athene: well now it's ok as he can just duck the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: thanks to that @C9|pg||
nt|barnets: now you see had he shifted spades another spade would set up the Q|pg||
pc|dA|nt|3for3: and borderlind whether to upgrade to 18|pg||
pc|d5|nt|barnets:  so well played|pg||
nt|barnets:  playing hearts from top would be silly had east the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: this line would only be wrong if west had all the clubs, QJ10x|pg||
nt|3for3: i am sure with the 10 of clubs, we'd have seen a different auction|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: which is much less likely than east having @HQxx|pg||
nt|barnets: before @D10 out|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|petergill: Bd 46: The operator at other table on Bd 46 wrote that he did not have time to see the bidding and play, hence he could only see that it went spade lead, 2nd spade then we know not ...|pg||
nt|petergill: what happened for game to make. The lead was a small spade, I think. |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: how about quasi-forcing roland?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sidebar   playing precision but not transfers in comp     Kx  QJ  J9xx QT8xx   1@H-(DBL)-?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry that wasn't meant for the room|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@C likely 'serious' slam try|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|petergill: Zia cannot ask for @HQ, has a problem|pg||
nt|petergill: so Is using 5@S queen ask to detemine whether to play 6@H or 6NT|pg||
nt|athene: double-dummy you can make this of course, but in practice i think it will go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Eric tanking|pg||
nt|athene: probably going to lose a diamond, two hearts and one or even two trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: i had many ims about the last hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|barnets: if the play was as recorded south would have made it had he ducked the @CJ|pg||
nt|ady: east suitable with not much in spades opposite a likely shortage|pg||
nt|dburn: not obvious what the right line is on a passive lead, but everything rational will work|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: nice easy hand to play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: n/s kept out of the bidding    in fact only 8 tricks in spades with the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|petergill: normally 5@S (if queen ask) shows all keycards, but here Zia knows that Hamman cannot bid 7@h, having limited his hand via 2NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobh1: the 4@S contract went down in the other room so the match tightens up|pg||
nt|algraves:  not sure. one of lifes mysteries, |pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT natural, GF|pg||
nt|3for3: i guess you can probably make 7 looking at all of the hands|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  kept out sorry|pg||
nt|petergill: sometimes 5@S is to play on auctions like this one|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess you can - East may be squeezable in three suits|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: had he won the club ace he was down|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c5|nt|3for3: he is|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer, with only eleven top tricks in six, may take some time over the play|pg||
nt|3for3: diamond jack lead, one of the spex suggests!|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|3for3: that might be his partner's choice tho :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|barnets: so we dont really know what happened|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@H is intermediate|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|algraves:  the big club players these days have developed a keen eye for what auctions make it hard for the opponents to bid accurately|pg||
nt|algraves:  for instance on that hand some standard experts would raise to 2@H to make their game auction easier in case partner has strong hand.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H ony choice|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     e/w  might win the auction in hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs a bit more to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is michaels|pg||
nt|dburn: likely flat, because Meckwell have lots of wrenches, but still...|pg||
nt|3for3: featherweight opening by hurd|pg||
nt|3for3: I guess he likes his shape and good spot cards|pg||
nt|dburn: not exactly a Mike Tyson overcall by Hamman either|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Down 2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Spector has found the 4-1 split  |pg||
nt|3for3: 3@D a fit jump, likely|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S will be too|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petergill: 2NT showed exactly 3 spades, hence E knew that they had a 5-3 spade fit. I'm not sure how West asks for @HQ|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d must be something special - can't believe it's just diamonds and clubs; what about hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: i can't see what was written|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|algraves:  playing precision you know partner is limited so game in unlikely unless partner can start jumping aroudn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal  18+ bal,   2@D = game force 5+@D|pg||
nt|athene: nice @S10 makes 3nt very comfortable here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 97 might be misscored|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks|pg||
nt|3for3: 4nt ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: how about x for the flexibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  so 1@S muddies the waters a little bit more than 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think with his good 19 count, West intended 5@S as a queen ask, but when it's Hamman who passes 5@S, one tends to think that Hamman is usually right |pg||
nt|algraves:  we are not quite sure what the deeper meaning of the last bid was. but 6@H or 6NT are easy makes so an opportunity for Spector|pg||
nt|algraves:  I bet they are irritated though. That much we know for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D also ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: negative DBL by north is much easier IF 1@D=4+@D unbal|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i took care of it :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: operators don't listen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: really can't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: rodwell doesn't want jeff to declare..lol|pg||
mb|4S|nt|algraves:  just to finish for board 20 , I suspect that declarer also took the 4th club and then led a diamond to his QT. The defense had no answer to that line|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are splitting up later this year. Hamman will play with Justin Lall in another team and Levin-Weinstein will replace Zia - Hamman in the much-heralded famous Nickell team |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D in the picture   doubt they'll play 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is not a success n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: favorable|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt want to chance a pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfk: might get 500 on agood day|pg||
pc|h2|nt|algraves:  Grue likes to open NT type hands with NT more so than almost any expert around these days|pg||
nt|ady: should be 11 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@H is defined as non constructive |pg||
nt|algraves:  by agreement|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: 5@D not that nice on a heart lead is it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to sleep Al|pg||
nt|barnets: just duck it and it will make|pg||
nt|athene: sure but it gives you a guess|pg||
nt|3for3: or 590 on a bad one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: and might go down in 5 on a bad day|pg||
nt|3for3: not an easy hand with taps looming|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|algraves:  he had another bid over 4@D is he had a good supporting hand for @H|pg||
nt|ady: in dangerous waters  above 4 level|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Rodwell did not have weak 2@D in arsenal    they play 2@D opener = 3-suit short @D|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly not - that dummy may not have got the most heartfelt "thank you partner" from Wooldridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: will need to draw last trump with dj in dummy|pg||
nt|3for3: right|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|barnets: certainly on a spade lead the heart goes on the spade|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they forgot to X in the OR|pg||
pc|sK|nt|algraves:  North is 3 HCP short of there , albeit loose , standard. but they make a nice stop after the 2NT start|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: best for north to duck 1st heart|pg||
nt|ady: then switch to a club|pg||
nt|bigtrain: isn't this always -2?|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w would have been much better to defend 3N down a few|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its def -2 at least|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: oops!|pg||
nt|dburn: ...and more spades may be enough to beat him from here - not sure|pg||
pc|d7|nt|barnets: after easts 4@D pick a major perhaps west should have bid spades at the 4 level|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: declarer will need to go up with A@C  and get spade right to make 9|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: will probably draw 3 rounds of trumps  and trust to good fortune in hearts   |pg||
nt|ady: either 3-3   or as they lay   or 10 doubleton|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzfk: re oops|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: on lead of @SK Grue would have unblocked if he'd started with @SQTx|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't need to pick the spades as he has a strip squeeze on S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 79   Lee 28-5 for the set   leads Fleisher by 48|pg||
nt|ady: in fact can play spade to ace    and south will be squeezed in the blacks|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|3for3: now he has time to enjoy his long heart|pg||

mb|1D|nt|algraves:  well done peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what does meck bid over strong 1N?|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 15-17?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves:  sometimes you can talk yourself into something obscure|pg||
nt|algraves:  pull trump and play on trick source often has a lot going for it|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: this one more interesting|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think 4@S is cold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: y|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohler treating as stronger -- but i was curious|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X-f-2@H or maybe a tactical 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: the defense cannot profitably attack @Cs|pg||

nt|bigtrain: hs 2 ways to show majors|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi ko|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: can't readd meaning of xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: asks partner to escape to 1@H|pg||
nt|barnets: may ask to bid the next step|pg||
nt|mildredb: might be McCabe forcing south to bid 2@S|pg||
nt|barnets: so north can show his suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzfk: alerted*|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they have strict rules and this is defined as not penalty|pg||
nt|3for3: slam on running the spades here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: hello|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H here would imply longer @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  1N-(3@S)-3N-end|pg||
nt|bigtrain: since meck bids michaels with all michels shapes|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Diamond 35-0 this set   now leads Jacobs by 51|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but each match playing a unique set of boards|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see a game for EW here|pg||
nt|athene: they'll play 5@C i imagine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C could be game force balanced hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so only promises 2+@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: should be 2 crd difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 3@S cold|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they have defined when a pass is penalty and when its a punt|pg||
nt|barnets: this is looking like another swing for spector|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cops being summoned i think|pg||
nt|barnets: my guess is norths bid xx was conventional |pg||
nt|barnets: and south forgot|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: xx forced 2s..some suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: who are screen mates?  south & west?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: s/w|pg||
nt|bigtrain: n/e|pg||
nt|tez: west thinking i belive|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: west thinking..of course|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobh1: is what i meant to say|pg||
nt|petergill: South had a tough bid - Axx in clubs looks poor for 1NT because|pg||
nt|bigtrain: since with 55 or 65 he bids 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  Cheek hopes that Grue has similiar spades as last hand|pg||
nt|barnets: north would like to x for a spade lead but south may have none|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: S told W he had no idea about XX.. conflicts with N explanation|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|algraves:  it is possible that South, after being told the Mecks pass was not penalty decided just to pass and let Rodwell start bidding , sure he would not be passing for penalty|pg||
nt|3for3: which they don't, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: Director was already in room and is discussing situation with Eric|pg||
mb|4D|nt|petergill: with longer clubs North would balance with 1NT, not Dbl|pg||
nt|algraves:  well said|pg||
nt|petergill: Time now to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  so on the next round, having limited his hand with 1@D he can suggest max values with a club card|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure, but I think this suit is fractionally the wrong side of the odds to run|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1:  68  Spector opened weak 2@D  playing 5@D west -- but @C lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: why can't you beat 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will likely be a flat result|pg||
nt|petergill: South has tried to get North to declare 3NT if North has KJ or Qx or J10x or J9x or the like in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening lead against Zia's 3N was @S9|pg||
nt|barnets: this  should be down 2 for 5 imps to spector subject to appeal|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  so two down|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes it is normal to bid two balanced hands with lots of points to 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  occasionally the bridge spirits throw the defenders a bone|pg||
nt|algraves:  exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Very well bid by NS|pg||
nt|algraves:  excellent bidding to a laydown game|pg||
nt|3for3: this has the elements of a 4/6 hand...one place you dont want to be is in 5M|pg||
pc|sK|nt|algraves:  to keep them coming back|pg||

nt|petergill: NS won world junior championships 7 to 13 years ago, so would now be in their early 30s|pg||
nt|athene: returning a small spade would keep control of the suit but it is unlikely declarer has a useful pitch later on the @SJ anyway|pg||

mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: no swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 2+@D  |pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for e/w best by east|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|bobh1: another light opener, this time without a 5-card major|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  on hand 38  down 2 in OR    |pg||
nt|algraves:  at the other table declarer did take a more complex line of play on 38 and this time, the simple line was best|pg||
nt|algraves:  note that Souths entire auction was pointed towards 3NT by his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening bid structure is identical for both pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and comparable agressive approach|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C only one-round-force, right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL = 4@S or 4/5@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: 2@S    invitational it seems|pg||
nt|algraves:  when planning your auction always focus on the likely games|pg||
nt|bigtrain: only NF if 3@C is the rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: They will probably avoid 6@H if they find they lack an ace plus @HQ |pg||
nt|ady: typical flat 11 opening these days|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: Grue has a secret weapon to defenc 3NT   and 3 spades looks difficult|pg||
nt|algraves:  and if possible any positional considerations|pg||
nt|barnets: in 2@HXX defense have to be careful to actually beat it|pg||
nt|dburn: I make it 11/12ths of the 2-2 breaks and 1/4th of the 3-1s, and I am too tired to do that in my head but I believe it to be less than 50%|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: not sure if Meck's RDBL  showing @H honor  or just cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: oops..wron game contract..this should be beaten|pg||
nt|3for3: that looks right|pg||
nt|3for3: more effective lead here by hamman|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  of course he was happy to play partscore if partner did not have extra values|pg||
nt|petergill: Bidding to 6@C is not crazy, but is doomed by the club break|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: Zia was a bit light for 4@S, but it worked because in induced N to save|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 28-2 set for Nickell|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: looks like 4@S depended on an inspired @C play|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: 4! down 1 on ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S down on ruff|pg||
nt|algraves:  Yes I think the logic of 4@S is clearly a big diamond fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cn tap declarer out also|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but South was not on the same page presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: there;s no certainty,, but the odds are good..rodwell can overtake and play d..he should suspect ns diamond fit for 4s jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: if clubs are continued, meck can make a similar judgement based on the auction and club shortage in N|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: spector doing well this session   might get more imps here|pg||
nt|barnets: this will likely make just 7 tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: roddy could have arranged either partner to play this contrct|pg||
nt|3for3: tho a spade will lead to a quick set far more often....|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: South seems to have bid out his shape. I'm not sure what the bids at the 3 level mean|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobh1: 10 imps to nickell on the prev board when Kohler didn't cue bid and they stopped at the 2-level|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room west opened 1@H and this made it more difficult|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|algraves:  that is key card in Hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll bet he makes 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: hurd is thinking about the hand not this trick|pg||
nt|3for3: might be thinking where to win this trick :)|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, they are rattling through the deals here but the other room are no slowcoaches - Meckwell flattened 6@s and won 2 IMPs for playing 5@h where Zia might have beaten 5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: probably should win in hand and lead small spade for maximum possibilities..of course everything works|pg||
nt|dburn: not that 5! had eleven on top exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry, 5@h|pg||
nt|3for3: For those who missed last set, there is a potential appeal that would be worth 11 imps to Spector.  Differing explanations on opposite sides of screen.|pg||
nt|dburn: very tough hand for Hurd at the table - easy for us, but he will be thinking "what can I do if the diamonds don't run? what if West has the @sK?"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|algraves:  I suspect that 3NT was " forward going "|pg||
nt|petergill: so 5@H is two keycards and no queen of @H|pg||
nt|ady: maybe only 9 now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|3for3: doesnt he have 9 sure ones?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: so N considers 5@H or 6@C|pg||
nt|barnets: for n/s to bid any diamonds|pg||
nt|3for3: no, i cant count|pg||
nt|dburn: I think only eight, but as I said, I am tired :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|algraves:  he knows that Zia has a singleton for his bidding|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes many pairs have followed the Italian style of responding after overcalls which involves picking out specific invitational or better type hands so that if the opps pre empt in the overcalled suit, then partner is well placed to compete|pg||
nt|petergill: and chooses well|pg||
nt|algraves:  2 no Q |pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by NS, I think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: NS brief system summary http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=943&pid=722 |pg||
nt|ady: J@C   looked better at trick 2   to protect diamond position|pg||
pc|d6|nt|algraves:  yes I think the logic was that North had encourged but denied a @S control so 4@C showed a @S control on the side, hence the Key card ask|pg||
nt|algraves:  Note that the math of slams is that you dont want to be in slam off an ace and the Queen of trumps because then it is 50 50 in theory that you make|pg||
nt|algraves:  sometimes it is a little more because you have 9 trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: while the bring 680 happens|pg||
nt|algraves:  sometimes less when you have 8 trumps and " handling charges "|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @HK guareentees 9 tricks|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: hands like this are a nightmare for declarer, who may overthink and actually play for the diamonds to be foul and the @sK to be wrong, instead of taking his chances in order|pg||

nt|algraves:  so just to follow up on the 2@S bid. |pg||
nt|ady: how did that make?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from NS SSF   "Mid-hand honor leads: shift to 10 generally shows interior sequence (HJT or HT9), typically lead rusinow through declarer (except as above)"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swing action for Rodwell would be PASS :)   looks like auto opener for him|pg||
nt|athene: this could get very competitive if NS find their diamond fit|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s may compete to 5@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves:  if it is invitational then when the opps blast to 4@H then partner can make a reasonable decisoin|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|algraves:  if you bid just 1@S then it is a tough choice all aroudn|pg||
nt|3for3: normal 4@H game, Spector stole a trick in the OR|pg||
mb|3D|nt|algraves:  and 2@S weak is just not that effective anymore |pg||
nt|algraves:  2@S invitainol has much more reward |pg||
nt|barnets: slam bid in open room |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we knew somebody sitting EW would bid 1@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: strong result for nickell in the OR|pg||
nt|dburn: he'll need to steal more of those than there are boards if he's to win this one - still, one big swing...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: was jsut what south wanted to hear    but a normal opening |pg||
nt|ady: both major games should go down e/w    both 4-1 trump splits|pg||
nt|bigtrain: deoesn't seem likely it will be bid here|pg||
nt|barnets: north drove to slam after souths 4 @H raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: a club splinter will do the job here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: everyone at this world class elvel usually falsecards with @SQ or @S7 if worried about a ruff, so by playing the natural card of @S , Hurd was trying to make Zia think that East's ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @S( was not a doubleton. Very delicate. Only an expert would fall for the true card being "tricky"|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 51|pg||
nt|algraves:  good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: if they get to slam after this start...  )|pg||

nt|barnets: in  6@H dec was assisted with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: he ruffed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: Zia's pushy 4@S call might backfire as if they struggle into 4@S NS might not save and 4@S might make|pg||
nt|petergill: East's @S9 i mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: There are some seeding points in play for 2013 trials, but only for intact teams and only to get bye to R16|pg||
nt|barnets: drew trumps and conceded a diamond|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: sorry..lost connection|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: 5@S would be down 1 on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: so par for n/s is 500 +|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: a sort of good-bad 2NT|pg||
nt|petergill: which forced 3@C perhaps. |pg||
nt|algraves:  well we dont know in these cases|pg||
nt|petergill: South's hesitation over 3@D makes it look like S thinks N has more than N has|pg||
nt|algraves:  but we can assume that they do|pg||
nt|algraves:  Cheek and Grue continue there sure footed play by bidding 6NT where Hamman Zia missed the slam|pg||
nt|algraves:  that has 12 tricks on any distribution|pg||
nt|petergill: Wooldridge has a lot of points, but many of them are locked up in the KQ doubleton in clubs|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: kibs suggesting 5 clubs or 5 diamonds make    but 11th trick not really there   |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C makes but after the @H tap you can only make 10 tricks in @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe a @D lead beats 5@C also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge bid 3@S over 3@D  auction isn't over yet|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes...  @D lead beats 5@C since you need a @H ruff for the 11th trick|pg||
nt|ady: heart tap in diamonds will stop any chance of ruffing a spade in north hand   and in 5 clubs a diamond lead  would  force trumps to be drawn to stop a heart ruff in south hand|pg||

nt|barnets: 2@H x  may go down 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: seems redouble was forced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now   is Cheek PASS forcing?|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ady: did 4 spades really make?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia sits north|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: this will be quick..|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|algraves:  then guess diamonds to make when east ruffs third club|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ady: 3 losers|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: On Bd 55, Meckwell are in the reasonable 6@C, likely to go down due to unlucky trump break|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he needed to duck that|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: Very unlucky for Nickell|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: The bidding is not as shown - we were down when the actual bidding took place|pg||
nt|petergill: Looks like 110 to me|pg||
nt|algraves:  we do know that the final auction is 2@S by Wests|pg||
nt|barnets: south is on lead so a spade lead just beats it 3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: not sure what the double of 2@H meant but north is surely min for his double so jumping to 3nt looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  70   Nickell played 1N in both rooms   it was only right in one of them  +90  -100 for no swing|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|algraves:  good point, we are not sure how the play went. There was a legititmate line so perhaps that occurred.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what % of unmakeable contracts come in because a defensive ace is taken prematurely?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Jan Martel   Zia actually usually sits S, but N is facing the window and Hamman didn't like the light in his eyes, so they changed - Zia said he hadn't sat N in years,|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wonder if swap vulnerability  if Meckstroth opens 2@C|pg||
nt|dburn: crumbs - is that really a double facing a passed hand? I mean, equal-level conversion notwithstanding...|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  south has normal opener for their limited precision 1D style|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H has lower risk than 2@H (no -800) and does not tell the opponents that you are weak |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: e/w   might make 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  they would bid zero hearts for the lead if they could but you have to bid at least 1 I understand|pg||
nt|athene: xx = psyche?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue finally gets a chance to operate|pg||
nt|athene: east definitely very close to 2@C opener|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems normal to me...  but i play with meck alot :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h presumably a sound spade raise|pg||
nt|barnets: and in the other room too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgehands.com/E/Equal_Level_Conversion_Doubles.htm|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s would be weaker, I guess|pg||
nt|barnets: south made a good spade raise |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i imagine their range is 14-16|pg||
nt|petergill: Joel Wooldridge prefers Dbl of 1@H to 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia did overcall 1@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for both pairs  2@C opener = 10-15, 6+@C|pg||
nt|barnets: and north only bid  3@S and they missed a decent game|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about 3@d - if it shows shortness, South could just bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: had north tried with  3@H south may have bid game|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, OK - I an sure why East bid 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sorry..typo guys..hurd passed over 3c|pg||
nt|dburn: potential for Nickell here, though - plus 300 North-South looks pretty good|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobh1: that seems to be the popular range among these young tigers|pg||
pc|d2|nt|algraves:  requires @D lead to defeat 3NT if my double dummy analysis is correct|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzfk: picked-em clean in the other room|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|algraves:  Well the feeling " on the street" was that this was going to be a close well played match|pg||
nt|ady: yesz  should lose 3 diamonds and 2 aces|pg||
nt|algraves:  note the effect of the NS bidding . it made it very hard on EW to have a sure footed auctino|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue envisions hand playing on cross ruff after 3@C from Meck|pg||
nt|barnets: on 71 nickel had a chance when spector bid up to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: well stolen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unusul way to win 3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unusual|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: Raising the hearts which South showed by doubling 1@H|pg||
nt|barnets: but north has to lead the @HA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|ady: did 3@H  promise anything   was a leb bid available after east doubled 2 spades?|pg||
nt|petergill: Should be 130|pg||
nt|barnets: and led a " normal " @DK|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|algraves:  of course you need to be playing a strong club to give you cover on hans like this , so that the non one club openers are limited to 15|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: 4 hearts hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: is this lead true?|pg||
nt|algraves:  so one can argue wether West should have bid , the point was that NS just doing there normal bidding made it difficult to sort everything out.|pg||
nt|algraves:  They play Rusinow in bid suits|pg||
nt|petergill: or he might play "safe" (unsafe if clubs 4-1) for 110 by not trying the @D hook|pg||
pc|c4|nt|algraves:  and why not lead a @S?|pg||
nt|algraves:  got to lead something|pg||
nt|dburn: and unless Hurd makes a somewhat unlikely seven overtricks here, plus 300 North-South will score pretty well|pg||
nt|3for3: the cards lay very well for north south|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|petergill: Al, can you see why @SQ is a good play here?|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot, but if Zia is doing it, there must be a reason|pg||
nt|dburn: and I am sure why West raised it, and why North-South withdrew from the auction - they could not know how good a fit they had|pg||
pc|d5|nt|algraves:  remember the @D bid just said no 5 card major not 14-16 balanced not 6 clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i like 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge in 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 1@S automatic|pg||
nt|bigtrain: totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S needs suit quality|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: seems a diamond lead more normal than underleading 5 card suit with the ace|pg||
nt|3for3: grue penalized for super light opening.|pg||
nt|3for3: Of couse, a spectator notes that if he had rebid 2@C....|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe that would have been Gazzilli, or some such - no one has voluntarily bid clubs to show clubs since about 1983|pg||
nt|3for3: I suspect he didnt relish the though of a preference to his 98653 of hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: not gazilli|pg||
nt|3for3: they do the big club thing|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobh1: if it was 15-17, S would invite|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, Grue judged to lead the suit the partnership was known to have, and put declarer to potential guess at trick one.|pg||
nt|ady: whatever led    no chance to make|pg||
nt|algraves:  if King in dummy declarer may well get it wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl makes @DK likely to be offside, so there was a real danger of a @D ruff if @D was played at Trick 2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|athene: @CA was a falsecard i guess|pg||
nt|athene: trying to make declarer put east with another high card somewhere else|pg||
nt|athene: for example the @SK :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   i think @CA to help clarify 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: well, if he played the @CK at trick 1 and then turned up with the @HQ as a passed hand, it would not be too hard to drop the @SK|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|algraves:  personally I like the dash of that lead even though it cost a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  even though it did not gain a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  did not cost |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: dont think it cost  |pg||
nt|petergill: Even with @DK onside, a @D ruff was posible if the @D hook was taken|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|bobh1: and N wouldn't open 1N altho they often promote and demote out of range hands|pg||
nt|agumperz:  David Stevenson Blog: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/def_1nt01.htm|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one doesn't look promotable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps -- but i suspect more geared toward @D suit pref|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he knew Cheek was ruffing -- so takes opportunity to help Rodwell|pg||
nt|athene: well declarer is just short of tricks now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: even if he gets the spades right|pg||
nt|athene: he had to lead a diamond towards the queen i suppose|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@H transfer to 4@S|pg||
mb|6H|nt|athene: looks a bit impossible to me|pg||
nt|dburn: if this is forcing, OK, but if it isn't it might end the NS auction|pg||
nt|dburn: but now South may feel in duty bound to support diamonds, which as far as I can see he has not yet done|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he never supported @D|pg||
nt|barnets: diamond lead and spade switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C game force promises either 4@H or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: it's not good enough anyway but it would give declarer a nasty moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  es I think he wanted the @S trick now and wanted an entry to hand to deal with trumps eventually and just as you say, so as not to have to broach diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|3for3: oooh, i thought spector was going to play the same contract at both tables for a second|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: There might be an "intra-finesse" here for an overtrick|pg||

nt|barnets: against hearts|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobh1: Joel might have sniffed at slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S by Cheek  stopper showing   and implies concern about @H|pg||

pc|c2|nt|barnets: how about a spade lead v 5@C|pg||

nt|algraves:  gadzooks an intra finesse in @D|pg||
nt|algraves:  we bring you all the exciting news|pg||
nt|petergill: In @D, lead low to 7 or 9, then run queen for one loser. The term intra-finesse was invented by Gabriel Chagas of Brazil in (I think) a Bols Bridge Tip|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky lie of the EW cards seems to doom everything now|pg||

nt|ady: or heart lead from north if west plays 5@D|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes you are %100 per cent correct, it was A Bols Tip|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event   shows schedule with viewer's timezone|pg||
nt|athene: there might be some action here|pg||
nt|3for3: potential slam hand here..|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|athene: strong club, north bids something or other...depends if EW find their diamond fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sometimes s just has spades to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@D   down 1 on hand 44    |pg||
nt|algraves:  a wild hand that last one.|pg||
nt|petergill: but overtricks are of little interest to winning imps players|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since boards are not duplicated across matches -- teams can agree to start sooner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman did not bid    Hurd playing 4@H East on @CK lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|algraves:  tyed at get at one of the Get Smart  agents|pg||
nt|3for3: 3nt some kind of spade raise...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ hcp unbal or 17+ bal     2@H=game force 5+@H|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: last board of the segment...thx all |pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: game force with 4 or 5 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: zia wanted a mini-splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  he claimed too quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most, if not all of the other tables still have boards to play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|algraves:  he will not sleep well if they lose by one imp|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D is not too bad a contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south hand perfect for Raptor 1N overcall   but the only top pairs i know who play that are from Scandinavia/Germany|pg||
nt|barnets: good result n/s in open|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: I believe just a short break. 5 or 10 min|pg||
nt|dburn: unlike Zia to pack it all in with quite a lot of slam potential|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: 6@D is an interesting spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't imagine Meck sitting for this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 6@D won't be in the picture|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  73  Cohler in 6@CX East|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores get posted to http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2012/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|algraves:  the cute one|pg||
nt|algraves:  well this hand is down right boring compared to the last few|pg||
nt|algraves:  I think Maxwell Smarts partner was agent 86 , wasnt she?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|algraves:  99, ? then MAX was 86|pg||
nt|algraves:  of course|pg||
nt|ady: nice lead    but should come home with clubs 3-2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Poland too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was told by many :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: still, maybe he needs a perfect hand opposite, and maybe he is mindful of his partner's dictum: "don't play me for the perfect hand, I never have it"|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: right   i included them in "scandinavian"|pg||
nt|bigtrain: has to break them sometime|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: i'm expecting a few more imps for nickell on 27|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks like 110 to n/s|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ady: diamond to ace     spade to ace    cash 1 more diamond   and duck a club|pg||
pc|d3|nt|algraves:  Maxwell Smart was played of course by Don Adams, agent 86 and he was an avid bridge player. I played rubber bridge with him at the old Cavenish west in LA  a baziion years ago|pg||
nt|petergill: Even I (who have lost the Aussie Open Team Playoff Grand Final by one imp twice in recent years, including a few weeks ago) regard overtricks at imps as less important than ...|pg||
nt|petergill: maintaining full focus on the big swings|pg||
pc|d7|nt|algraves:  mind you there was no compelling reason to play the @D that way|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: not yet|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bigtrain: not with that play|pg||
nt|barnets: now def have it down|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|algraves:  unless he smoked out all the relevant high cards in time|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|algraves:  I agree, if that is the choice|pg||
nt|barnets: not any trouble for 4@H here tx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 500 to nickell|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 45 boards remain in the match|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this is his flashback time here at 86 apiece|pg||
nt|3for3: well done to nickell|pg||
nt|dburn: but Hamman had the perfect hand for Zia's decision - one where the club finesse lost|pg||
nt|3for3: partner could have had qx of clubs, and slam would be...better|pg||
nt|dburn: come back tomorrow - we're gonna do fractions|pg||
mc|8|nt|algraves:  perhaps it is possible to train the mind to maintain relaxed full focus in all situations. ( not that I can mind you )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule says restart in 75 minutes   but teams can agree to start earlier  [boards not duplicated across matches]|pg||
