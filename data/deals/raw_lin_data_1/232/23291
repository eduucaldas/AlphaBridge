nt|STRIK3R: 4@h is a good contract, the 4-1 split against can become a problem|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: think it must be forcing, 2@d that is|pg||
nt|varange: yes, if it shows extras|pg||
nt|varange: I'm trying to decide if I'd bid a forcing 1NT with the west hand if it was available, or 1@s|pg||
nt|varange: after 1@h that is|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: I see, I would bid 1@s my self, since I dont play 1N forcing :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|varange: yes, 1@s is the "normal" bid in 2/1 as well|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: might be thinking fo slam in west now, all he need for that to be a nice contract is AKQxx in @h, KQxx in @d and singleton @s|pg||

nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|varange: the redouble?|pg||

nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: well, if it denies a stopper, then west would upgrade his hand because he would think there were no wasted values in clubs|pg||
nt|varange: but his 3@h makes me think they also play the rdbl as a half stopper|pg||
