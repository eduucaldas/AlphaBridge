mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: there is the transfer reponse  (1@D) |pg||

mb|d|nt|penseur9: take out double by east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: When the opponents open an artificial strong or multi-meaning 1@c it's usually a good idea to preempt before their hands can be further defined.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: S certainly gave e-w every opportunity to lead trumps for him, but they didn't cooperate.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not the best spot |pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|andreasw:  small @c lead was needed to keep this in 9 i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: Most people who play transfer responses would rebid 2@h with the n hand to show a real fit.|pg||
nt|sybarra: squeaky double,  probably -1 if defense can handle it |pg||

nt|runnerup:  after east opening bid 3nt looks nice -but @s finess off and this 22 points 3nt would fail -of course in is not biddable and west in with 2 @s now so other story|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you don't leave this one in, when will you?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @s very scary -if partner has opening hand and short @s -youll lose hundreds and ns makes nothing|pg||
