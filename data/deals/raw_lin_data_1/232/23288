mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: there is the transfer reponse  (1@D) |pg||

mb|2C!|nt|penseur9: take out double by east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: When the opponents open an artificial strong or multi-meaning 1@c it's usually a good idea to preempt before their hands can be further defined.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|santyclz: S certainly gave e-w every opportunity to lead trumps for him, but they didn't cooperate.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not the best spot |pg||

nt|kemperg: :(|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  small @c lead was needed to keep this in 9 i think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: Most people who play transfer responses would rebid 2@h with the n hand to show a real fit.|pg||
nt|sybarra: squeaky double,  probably -1 if defense can handle it |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  norths pass with 6 points isn't regular bid with 6 point when partner open strong club|pg||

nt|santyclz: If you don't leave this one in, when will you?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @s very scary -if partner has opening hand and short @s -youll lose hundreds and ns makes nothing|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Bd 14 proved that conventional wisdom is not always right.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if east happens to lead singleton @c -inspite of his solid @d --north can play 4 @h out by ruffin 3. @c with Honor -but that is wrong in teams -in pairs if you try for 11 that can be agceptable -in teams -ruff low or not at all|pg||
