nt|Vugraphzfd: hope their card play slows down a tad, rather like bidding. :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfd: i *think* jimmy cayne is kibbing this table but not sure. this table has a few kibs irl|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Playing a 2/1 based system, w's hand is uncomfortable.  You don't really have he values to force to game if pd opens balanced 11 counts, but playing 1nt is not too pleasent a prospect either.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|santyclz2:  They may have some agreement that handles this kind of hand such as 3@c invitational, but it would seem much too strong for 3@c weak.|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rv: N-S play precision, E-W play 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This start may get them overboard unless 3@C NF|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: even playing precision, I might have opened South hand with 1@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|p dalvi: good morning every body|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Iyengar might bid 3@s as mild slam try (not sure of their methods)|pg||
nt|reisig: Indeed  - too high|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: critical which major South leads, but no real reason not to lead the known 5-card suit|pg||

nt|geot: Evenstads 2@C melding var god, gjorde det vanskeligere for N/S|pg||

nt|kit: Well, opener knows the difference if he gets an invitational sequence|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|geot: VEd det andre bordet sa øst for Heimdal pass over nords dobling, det synes jeg er veldig merkelig med AKQ sjette|pg||

nt|rv: this is 4th round of RR, top 4 out of 5 teams (Cabal, Ruia and Azure are other 3) qualify for SFs|pg||
nt|sunit:  yes but on a @D lead 3 @D's and a @H loser|pg||

nt|rv: precision @c here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rv: every team gets a bye since we have 5 teams and not playing turner movement|pg||
nt|andyv:  1NT with 5 card major becoming less unusual...I do like to have 3 cards in the other major however|pg||
nt|rv: JM started with 2@c hoping to bid smolen 2@h if Ajay had bid 2@d|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, they will surely land in 3@D|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rv: Meenal, any idea about scores after 3rd round|pg||
mb|3D|nt|p dalvi: probably use H relay and show 24-25|pg||
nt|indianidol: scores after 3 rnds : azure  59, poddar 49, indiablues 46,  nest inn 41  , cabal 36.|pg||
nt|rv: Kirpa's 2@d is aggressive O/C, he must have bid based on white position|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: ty Mahesh|pg||
nt|rv: Ajay's 3@c possibly shows 5M, JM has possibly forgotten sys|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks like that|pg||
nt|andyv:  however no hard done although missed a good slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  no harm|pg||
nt|rv: JM plays with too many diff partners and this is not his preferred treatment, he plays 2n to show 5M min and 3M to 5M max on 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  and stayman used to be so easy:)|pg||
nt|rv: Ajay plays 3m to show 5M max hand and possibly shows 2n to show 5M min hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|indianidol: Welcome Rv|pg||
nt|sunit:  will make on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: It will be hard for North to resist AK of diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: And another prediction down the drain|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|p dalvi: north 5 -7 bal or c suit well not my style all J and Q|pg||
nt|rv: this could be costly even at these colors|pg||
nt|rv: double dummy defense can possibly take it 4 down?|pg||
nt|rv: this deal good for neutrals and supporters of Azure|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will net 10 tricks...if you are EW you have to hope 6@s isn't bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|geot: Det meste går galt for Heimdal nå. I det forrige spillet endte det med et rutervalg som gikk galt, og nye 11 IMP til Tromsø som kan presse trondheimslaget ut av pallen om dette ...|pg||
nt|geot: fortsetter|pg||
nt|arunbapat: Venkay's 4D instaed of 3C would have put lot of pressure on E.|pg||
nt|rv: good afternoon Arunji wlc|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|grebrof: Kristiansand er på 2dre nu|pg||
nt|kit: I must say I can't find the attraction of a spade lead from the North hand on this auction.|pg||
nt|kit: Still, very difficult hand to play -- not many losers, but where are 9 winners going to come from?|pg||
nt|reisig: Might opt for the @h finesse and xruff after|pg||
nt|kit: so that would give him 2 spades, 2 hearts, 1 club -- he would need 4 trump tricks.|pg||
nt|kit: I guess they are there|pg||
nt|kit: But he might instead go for ruffing finesse in hearts -- and that would fail and defense can draw trumps|pg||
nt|reisig: It's still better than the 3@c contract in open room :)|pg||
nt|kit: One argument for direct heart finesse is that it is easier for South to shift to a diamond than North, particularly since North didn't lead one to begin with suggesting a dangerous ...|pg||
nt|kit: holding.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|p dalvi: he could bid 1@S and final con remains same |pg||
nt|p dalvi: 1s = 0 t0 4 |pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: I am told by Ajay's friends that 2n shows @h and 3@c shows @s max hand|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|sunit:  cant make now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|c2|nt|geot: merk at rutervalget som ble tatt var med oddsen da Helgemo visste mye om sitsen og hadde rett i at øst var lengst i ruter|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

nt|rv: Azure comprises of Maj Hooda, Ashok Vaidya, S.K.Iyengar, Puneet Gangal, Kamal Mukherjee and Ashim Mukherjee|pg||
nt|kit: Of course that does risk North ruffing high -- so he judged from the lead that spades were 4-3|pg||

nt|kista:  Hi all GM|pg||
nt|kit: This lead makes things easier.  I know the books say not to lead singletons with 4 trumps, but that doesn't mean the books are right.|pg||
nt|kit: Even now, diamond shift could create problems|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe declarer should have led 10 of spades, not jack, since he would prefer spade to be ducked.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|rv: in seniors Bowl last year, Indian seniors represented by Ruia, Archie, Lal, Subhash, Kamal Roy and Ashok Vaidya narrowly missed qualification to QFs|pg||

nt|reisig: Back to 110|pg||
nt|kit: Since North can't get in to cash the queen of diamonds, it looks like contract will still make -- 4 trump tricks, 2 heart tricks, and 2 very slow club tricks.|pg||

nt|andyv:  he can get up to 8 but that's it|pg||

nt|andyv:  yes, plenty of tricks in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: zero count partner?....no, i have an ace|pg||
nt|kit: When the auction screams for a trump lead, as this auction does, maybe East should lead one without looking at the rest of his hand.|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|p dalvi: both have 1/2 stopper|pg||
nt|rv: stiff @c and absence of aces is dampener to bid on|pg||
nt|andyv:  that will go to 9 when he sees the @d split|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|kit: Actually on a trump lead maybe 2@H wouldn't have come home.  Now it is easy -- 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, and all 4 of North's trumps|pg||
