nt|vugraphzgx: 2@d opening for NS is "very weak" -- they play 2@H/@S openings as 8-10 hcp|pg||

nt|jron: I like my suit to be better w Hxx in other major; especially w a sadesuit -  but that is a matter of style|pg||
nt|runnerup:  170 in @s so fast pass /east to get points|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: E has asked N about any "strong hands" S might have in the multi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: so it seems he is a little "afraid" of running into a strong S hand|pg||
