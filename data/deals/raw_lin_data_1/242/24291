nt|fabsayc: good day all|pg||
mb|1H|an|2-3!H, 11-14|nt|osvaill83: probably start with a routine 3nt :)|pg||
nt|kit: hi Danny|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
mb|2H!|an|sign off|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H not at all forward going|pg||
mb|3D|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||
nt|phil: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|phil: same lead in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: this will take a lot of good guessing to make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|phil: Rosenberg ducked, diamond returned...not that anything really matters on this layout|pg||
pc|s4|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||
nt|riccho:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012Dublin/systems/OpenTeams/Monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: can get out for -2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: and he is likely to get spades right|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||
nt|pelu:  CC for EW: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|d2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same contract in open room|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|kit: Zia has chosen to not play spades and hope the opponents have to break the suit.  But I don't think they will have to do so.|pg||
nt|3for3: cant he ruff this and exit heart?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I guess he can -- or ruff this, ruff heart, exit with diamond|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: Or he can just keep discarding -- both lines work.|pg||

mb|p|nt|robinswr: weak 2?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: they don't play them|pg||
mb|1C|nt|phil: 2@s is something like 8-12 or so|pg||
nt|robinswr: sick weak 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfu: They play 2-level as 9-12 and 5+|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|runnerup:  notice 1 @d with 17 -no double|pg||
nt|phil: I guess 2@s would be a reasonable description now |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|robinswr: opening 1@c in 3rd seat might not be good if partner responds 1@s|pg||
nt|phil: Nunes should raise - 4@s is a good vul game|pg||
nt|runnerup:  very brave 2 @s  7south|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|phil: I think he'd pass 1@s - not loving it of course|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|phil: 3@c sounds natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|phil: so an opportunity missed|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: levin says "we should just play open notes"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hello. only score is accurate cos we started late|pg||
mb|1N|an|10-13|nt|phil: so what to open on an 8-4 :)? |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: you don't see these hands in textbooks|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil: Zimmerman had to be tempted to bid 6@d here|pg||
nt|phil: it cant be that expensive, and who knows who makes what? |pg||
nt|phil: yet, partner's 5@d made them guess|pg||
nt|phil: maybe East should x 5@h?  he has some surprise defense|pg||
nt|phil: although I'm not really clear what a w/w 5m opening is supposed to show|pg||
nt|phil: but definitely not KQTx in a side major :)|pg||
nt|phil: NS appear to have four losers, but it seems like they would have a hard time taking all four|pg||
nt|phil: give east Axxx of clubs, and 6@d actually makes - but so does 6M (probably)|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: do we know what fleischer's double shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
nt|phil: this will compress one of the losers|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think Martel will just come back a spade -- bigger danger declarer has ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just penalty worth hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: zimmerman double was either brave or foolhardy|pg||

mb|1D|an|4+  !D 14+ HCP|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzfu: Current Spingold results - http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2012/02/spingold/|pg||
mb|2S|an|GF, denies !S|nt|runnerup:  so Martel wanted to show only 1 of his suit .he is so weak |pg||
mb|2N|an|Limit Raise|mb|3S|nt|phil: very unclear to me what went wrong on that 3@s - sometimes both players make aggressive calls and get too high - sometimes they both go low - a lot of which has to do with the ...|pg||
nt|phil: nuances of 3@c, and what a direct 3@s over the x means|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so if you where listening henryB 2 days ago -we have lost all suits and nt also as a natural bid -he was still possitive that @s is natural-but now also that has lost|pg||
nt|phil: yes, Edgar Kaplan's continium has nearly reached its absurd conclusion|pg||
mb|4H|nt|runnerup:  3 @s -not claer to me|pg||

nt|phil: oh|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, 6@d is definitely possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: against a very weak nt, after norths double transfer bids by south give more options|pg||
mb|1D|an|4+ unbal|mb|1H|nt|3for3: ew might sniff around at slam here|pg||
nt|phil: I like 1@d. I loathe 2N|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he was afraid of pushing NS to a makeable slam?|pg||
mb|2H|an|limit raise in !D|nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: as I said before you arrived - Multon's 5@d have his opps a tough guess - and they might have guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|phil: *gave|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: They have a lot of high cards for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *just -1|pg||
mb|3S|an|cue|nt|phil: if Kamil bid 5@d (and why shouldn't he?) the spades would have been buried|pg||
nt|phil: now Zimmerman can pattern out|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|an|cue|nt|vugraphzfv: they like their 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will keep them out of any slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: true, but from helgemo's POV cant east hace a stiff club?|pg||
mb|4H!|an|RKC in !D|nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he though partner had heart support I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 5@H was a bold bid, in the jaws of unfavourable vulnurability |pg||
nt|phil: yeah - along with some nice defense too|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: solo|pg||
nt|xenya: all in all well done by both sides on the last hand|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|phil: 4@h does not handle well|pg||
nt|phil: he's tapped down to parity at T1|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike 4@S?|pg||
nt|phil: if hearts break OK, he can manage 4H + 5S + 1C and doesn't need the club hook|pg||
nt|phil: in spades can't you take 5S in hand, 3 ruffs in dummy plus two aces? |pg||
nt|xenya: unless they lead a trump|pg||
mb|5D|an|2 w/ Q in !D|nt|xenya: in the other room, N didn't get in -- still, S found a @C lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: he can, but even then there might not be 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|phil: yes that may cause difficulties - but maybe declarer can make something out of the heart suit then|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|an|alert|nt|3for3: q of clubs was the q of hearts, and slam is laydown|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|an|no side kings|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|kit: I don't really see What Helgemo can bid but 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are in sync with open room, almost equivalent auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: Maybe 5@S, focusing attention on club control at the slight risk of going down there.|pg||
mc|13|pg||

nt|phil: I just don't see Martel diving here|pg||
nt|robinswr: hard to bid with  Kx of spades|pg||
nt|phil: I said the other day, splinters one under the trump suit are hard to cope with, since partner does not have last train|pg||
nt|phil: that @sKx is awful here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|runnerup:  now the danger is overbid -not 4 @s -south is very good -but 11 looks to be there -so 6 is not going to be bid|pg||

nt|3for3: the danger of 3d round overruff if partner has xx of clubs and no jack of spades is quite real tho|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzfv: no superfluous conversation in this room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all very focused|pg||
nt|phil: in the other room in 4@s, declarer started to finesse in clubs, and then chickened out - South ruffed, returned a trump, and that was that|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@S in the other room, Rosenberg opted for a very unfortunate line|pg||
nt|phil: but he will be pleased to learn he won 3|pg||
mb|3S|nt|osvaill83: undo|pg||
nt|3for3: missing a pass|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry Phil :)|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: 3N is excellent NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many possible bids by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I agree -- that's why I think he has to just bid 4@S and hope that if East has a stiff club he can make a move.|pg||
nt|phil: but 3@h is in 800 country|pg||
nt|xenya: yeah|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|phil: wow Multon doesn't even consider 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wow, this works but is risking missing a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: hmm not sure if 2h or 2c should be alerted as garbage stayman. just happy i made out what she wrote.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that Kx looks very bad for slam|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: N is not concerned about hearts here, rather about the quality of the 1D suit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: just a spade doubleton and some aces|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some confusion over the x? |pg||
nt|phil: double these days generally means anything but penalty|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|3for3: a variation of 5 card stayman|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny says "i dont have much help" as she laid downdumy|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzfv: but molson says "you have trumps!"|pg||
nt|phil: well thats sad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: double was a @H stopper ask|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has problems here.  Even with the clubs coming in, there are only 8 winners.|pg||
nt|phil: and 3N must have meant a partial stopper|pg||
nt|phil: so he wasn't far off|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|phil: so why 5@d??|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|3for3: quite thin game.  needs clubs to behave, 44 diamonds for starters|pg||
nt|3for3: and 9th trick to come from spades.|pg||
nt|grebrof: !k and switch to @ds?|pg||
nt|grebrof: @H K|pg||
nt|kit: If East does shift to king of hearts, declarer will definitely win the trick|pg||
nt|kit: Since he is looking at down 1 if he ducks.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes. but it will make the defense easy|pg||
nt|phil: NS work very hard on ther agreemenets|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: can power out the hand|pg||
nt|kit: oh my!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|h4|nt|3for3: a super grovesnor!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: well was better to start the spades|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: of course Zia couldn't duck, but if he had .....|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: then if necessary could have ruffed the fourth and fifth spade|pg||
nt|3for3: helness 'knows' south cant duck that|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: Now will take spade finesse and be down 3.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart to jack, club ace and club ruff seems a simpler approach and makes 6 on layout|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|3for3: meanwhile 3nt came in at other table so big swing to monaco|pg||
nt|xenya: W is sort of sqaueezed|pg||
nt|grebrof: the lead was good again|pg||
nt|kit: either red suit would have been effective lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if clubs not breaking you still have the cross ruff line|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry to make 5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|osvaill83: makes now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzfv: lost track sorry|pg||
nt|xenya: now he can make it|pg||

nt|osvaill83: could have endplayed helgemo|pg||

nt|kit: Helgemo obviously fooled by the low heart shift, although it seems like he should have figured it out since declarer known to have 5 spades from auction.|pg||
nt|grebrof: @d K and endplay dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Zia knows opponents have made a mistake somewhere -- he just has to figure out where.|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, Rosenberg opened 1@H as E (3rd seat), W bid spades, and that was that |pg||
nt|grebrof: o, than K of !@d and small to 9|pg||
nt|kit: actually he can't make -- Helgemo can win diamond and exit low diamond.|pg||
nt|3for3: and he does know the whole hand at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 9@D covers|pg||
nt|kit: this looked like it would be a relatively dull hand, but things sure got interesting.|pg||
nt|grebrof: after watching Willenken and Rosenberg yesterday, I never thought they would ever be ahead|pg||
nt|kit: Still, it does seem as though Helgemo should have kept his heart.  I don't see how that could ever have been wrong whatever the hand is.|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|kit: Key was East's spade discard -- I can't imagine East would have pitched spade if he had an honor -- and if declarer has AK of spades then East must have king of hearts or we are ...|pg||
nt|kit: wasting our time.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: mumbling Zia: "What could it possibly be?"|pg||
nt|xenya: no imps ar stake|pg||
nt|3for3: at least 1 at stake|pg||
nt|kit: I can see Zia reading the position.  If so, he will win ace of spades, and lead jack of diamonds throwing the 9 -- hoping West has K108x.  And the West underleads and East claims|pg||
nt|3for3: that would be neat ending|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting point -- West led 5 of diamonds, so apparently they lead 3/5 vs. NT.  Thus, the end-play can't work.|pg||
nt|grebrof: even they dont lead 8 from KT85|pg||
nt|kit: And West isn't likely to be making a falsecard on lead on this kind of auction.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: garbage stayman|pg||
nt|xenya: prosaic, yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: Zia should stop playing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia: "I knew I could make it, I Just didn't know which chance you gave me"|pg||
nt|phil: but there's always that sequence where there's a little fuzziness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@D was preemptive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not constructive|pg||
nt|phil: they play transfers there kendrick? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in what sequence?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: the 3@S?|pg||
nt|phil: after the overcall - pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not that I know of|pg||
mb|1D|an|4+, unbal|nt|phil: I wonder how they'd show a constructive raise then? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: they possibly could, but I'm unsure|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil: I thought NS played Flannery....I'm confused now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think, multi|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
nt|phil: kind of a wacky multi opener red/white - maybe trying to create a little early action|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzfv: the "lost track" part may occur a lot, unfortunately, as these ladies at times play with supersonic gusto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thinking|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is generally 'transfer me' and 4@d is 'you bid it' - which Kamil will do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it will work out|pg||
nt|phil: looks like he wanted to protect any diamond cards in Marty's hand|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman has the world's fair on this auction|pg||
nt|phil: now - Zimmerman should be less excited about playing hearts now|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d advertises length in both|pg||
nt|xenya: if he bids 4@H, he will make it|pg||
nt|phil: NS can make a lot of sapdes however|pg||
nt|phil: I think they bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: assuming it gets passed out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Zimmermann in the tank. |pg||
nt|phil: 4@h is a little awkward to play - but I think South has the option of losing one of his trump tricks or allowing the diamond pitch to be taken, right? |pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C doesn't look too bad either -- until you see the whole layout|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, hearts that are "Hawaii" (5-0) is very bad for both|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps just an interesting, how do you stop 4@s? |pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: Interesting -- so Zia didn't work out that West could dodge the end-play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helgemo embarassed he threw his @H away|pg||
mb|2D|an|always denies 3!H|mb|3S|nt|phil: I would take dbl of 4@d as 'cards' and a subsequent x of 4@s as penalty|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: now 5NT or 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades are shakey, i think 4 enough|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D seems a tad conservative with that fine 46|pg||
nt|phil: Multon not excited about defending 4@s with his paucity of defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: action!|pg||
nt|phil: aieee|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder Zimmermann was in the tank -- the whole auction looks crazy, from his perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all purpose DSI double (do something intelligent)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H seems right for north on that basis|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: he might be afraid North has just hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: no oops here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: well 3 is down a lot but a deep position|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny has to use the restroom. the rest are waiting for her|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers started reading the newspaper|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: real news, not bridge news. hope she doesn't get distracted by all the crazy stuff happening today :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually i think she's doing the puzzles. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson seems a very friendly chatty person. she's back now.|pg||
nt|kit: now this bid I don't understand -- seems like clear 3NT call by Zia|pg||
nt|xenya: N might pass  now?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|3for3: well, north is a PH, so with just hearts he can just bid them, either a weak 2, or 2@H at second turn|pg||
nt|phil: Lightner from Fleisher now? |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|phil: a quick -2|pg||
nt|phil: Kamil will also rip 6@h|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: good point Danny -- I forgot about initial pass|pg||
pc|hK|nt|grebrof: what to bid than 2@d?|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil knows Fleisher is ruffing the heart, so his lead is suit preference|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kit: So here we have another close 3NT contract|pg||
nt|3for3: entry problems for the 9th trick, even if the clubs are 33.|pg||
nt|phil: don't they lose a diamond too? |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: i always bid 6nt if close|pg||

pc|d2|nt|grebrof: @d to 10?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: might ruff honor, and finesse the J@S?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: @Cs offer a better chance|pg||
nt|kit: if clubs 3-3, opponents can't cash 4 tricks |pg||

pc|d4|nt|grebrof: the 3 wins, npp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: it was correct|pg||
nt|kit: East didn't squander 8 of clubs on 2nd round of clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: almost certainly|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: I assume this is operator error with the club spots|pg||
nt|grebrof: for me, the operator is god - I dont know what happened :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, after the 2@C fuss, i might have gotten lost|pg||

nt|grebrof: Helness in the tank now?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: scores are correct but not the play/bidding obviously :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: 4 more boards. insurmountable odds against team joel|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, it was 8|pg||
nt|kit: A chance for Fleisher to get some IMPs back if they can somehow diagonse this slam|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|grebrof: at the other table I think it was a jumpfit|pg||
nt|grebrof: here explained as weakish|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe the problem will be even getting to game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: explained as weak, but how weak based off vul|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has been looking at the CC - its a jumpfit, but weakish then|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: those who really want to have commentary, try to go to new bbo version at www.bridgebase.com . there is audio commentary there|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: is weak 2s with east's hand ever okay? |pg||

nt|xenya: looks like it --nonvulnerable perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C forcing?, probably|pg||
nt|ritong: now we are in 3NT, from south or north depending upon kamil's decision to raise fsf|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: I played live bridge for the 2nd time ever yesterday. overbid like crazy. it was fun :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i'll go and het coffee|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this treatment or similar is called Cole convention, part of Washington Standard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: described in Bridge World many years ago by Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|ritong: ominous|pg||
nt|ritong: is there really anything else than 3NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher scratching his head...|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he cannot "transfer" NTs to his pard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south has shown a hand not worth a reverse with 5+ diamonds and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps fleisher worried about club stoppers, he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s would certainly show an other handtype|pg||
nt|ritong: although we can t be certain about their system inferences, but..|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for their cc and is studying their carding |pg||
nt|phil: if they do play weak NT's, isn't 2@s plenty? |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: bon|pg||
mb|4H|nt|grebrof: and ok result for HH here too|pg||
nt|xenya: this makes|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he's a touch too strong...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@S was alerted, but kamil didn't care for an explanation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: AND a big result here too|pg||
nt|kit: The good news for Fleisher here is that both pairs have a disaster on the same board|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, agree|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, that tends to compress the imps lost|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|vugraphzfv: willard let down the partition now. she's whispering to valerie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but unfortunately i can't hear them|pg||
nt|3for3: the bad news is they will still be down more than 50|pg||
pc|c5|nt|medwards: this hand should be a push i would think|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ritong: multon would lead the third best with six cards|pg||
nt|ritong: thus, @c3 cannot be more than 5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for diamond but patapon played heart. and so did disa. so they then redid it|pg||
nt|phil: in old KS, an early weak NT system, 3@s showed a powerhouse|pg||
pc|h6|nt|medwards: mildred is a very nice lady. she many good stories from the old days|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfv: we'll make sure to ask her about the good ole days then :)|pg||
nt|medwards: ask hr about first acbl conv cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this looks good for EW, no? i can see a small gain?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|grebrof: bidding a stretchy 3nt nonvul is more or less what they have so far|pg||
nt|3for3: he hasnt made this yet.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|phil: but their 1m openings were fairly beefy too|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||

nt|ritong: not good for multon's stomach ulcer, this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher threw a card in anger, so that may have hinted at zimmermann that it was down|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil: Roland tells me a @h lead gave away the contract in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: 35-17 Fleisher this segment -- the gap has narrowed down a little but is still quite big|pg||
nt|phil: Axx + Axx does not want to declarer the NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|osvaill83: and theres more to come :)|pg||
nt|phil: but if they play 2@s promises 6 - there's little option|pg||
mb|d|nt|medwards: must not play 3rd seet forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 3N by North looks pretty good to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: according to 1930's authors, noone has an opening here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: actually culbertson would open south hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfv: even after the double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nm|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: When South shows up with stiff heart, declarer won't misguess the diamonds|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has to have a stiff|pg||
nt|grebrof: or void|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but declarer won't be playing North for AJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: deciding between club and diamond|pg||
