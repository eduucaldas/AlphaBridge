nt|barnets: on a diamond lead slam has not any play|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: on another lead dec could hope|pg||
nt|barnets: to establish the 5th club|pg||

nt|barnets: does not work here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|grebrof: yes, east has to hold both @cs and @s|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@D a better contract than 3nt.  it can make even without @D's breaking 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: now at least he thinks he has play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|warrens:  also, won't go down as many when you do go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nystrom says "yuck" as he puts down dummy|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|barnets: or a 4-3 split with 2 entries|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|grebrof: someone told me they made 12 at the other table too, so maybe its still a draw :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yes - at least that is what they said - Rosenberg must have pitched a club; play went very fast in the middle|pg||
nt|barnets: so match is now tied|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|warrens:  East is squeezed if he didn't cash the club K first|pg||
nt|grebrof: when S had bid @cs, maybe he just gave up|pg||
nt|grebrof: dont think the @c K mattered|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, we'll assume declarer cashed all his trumps, leaving dummy with @S 10 and Qx of @C|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzff: Willenken alerts 2@C and was writing; then realized it was not an alert|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'd rather be in 5@C, since either they don't get trumps started OR I ruff out Kxx of @H's|pg||
mb|4C|nt|barnets: ttrump start does not work for def|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  rather than 3NT.  but 3NT is cold on 4-3 @D's|pg||
nt|barnets: as east has only 1  trump|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is always cold warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  on a trump lead?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  if trump are 2-2?|pg||
nt|barnets: they are not|pg||
nt|barnets: her|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|grebrof: I kinda like bidding with Ss hand - double is weired for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  on this hand, 5@C is cold, but in theory it's a cold choice between 3NT and 5@C|pg||
pc|d8|nt|warrens:  close choise|pg||
nt|warrens:  close choice*|pg||
pc|d9|nt|warrens:  this makes 4@H's if you can guess the @H's, but not easy after W's opening bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe dbl is both majors or @d and a major then|pg||
nt|grebrof: you risk P bidding @s|pg||
nt|barnets: you see north bid 2N in open|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|warrens:  the 4-1 @D break makes this even more difficult|pg||
pc|d7|nt|grebrof: E must have something for his bid, but it can just as likely be and H in @s|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|grebrof: I dont think they underbid in any case|pg||
nt|barnets: while QX is a great holding when partner has Jxx or the K or A it is not so good here|pg||
nt|barnets: Perhaps north could have tried 2@D instead|pg||
mc|11|pg||

nt|phil: a more delicate approach like 2@d might have got them to the correct game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: We now await Kamil's return|pg||
nt|phil: if you are a smoker (I am not) the Philly site was terrible|pg||
nt|phil: the playing area is 4-5 floors up, with no balconies, so smokers needed to go down four escalators or wait for an elevator|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|phil: there was a blurb in a Daily Bulletin stating that some players were smoking inside the building - and if they were caught doing so they would be escorted out without re-entry|pg||
nt|agumperz:  In the old days of course, the situation was ideal for the smokers, of course the nonsmokers had to wade through a cloud o ifnd their tables|pg||
nt|phil: imagine explaining THAT to your teammates, must less the client :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an| |mb|p|nt|phil: *much|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|phil: 3@d a retransfer I'm guessing|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  upmark has a nice hand opposite a super accept|pg||
nt|phil: he does, but unfortunately Fleisher has a natural diamond lead vs 6|pg||
mb|3N|an| |mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  as long as fleisher does not double a spade cuebid along the way...|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|phil: 3@s non serious? 3N - spade cue? those are purely guesses|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i wouldn't expect him to|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Fleisher's on lead|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  right, sorry|pg||
mb|5S|an|2+Q|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: curiously there are 12 tricks in NT as well on a non-diamond lead, but I expect a diamond to come out as long as Fleisher doesn't overthink it|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: wow|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i am surprised by the double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Kamil out of pass cards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: he must have some very reliable information about the bidding to x|pg||
pc|dK|nt|agumperz:  i guess he can infer there is no diamond singleton in east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: A lot of discussion btwn Fleisher and Upmark|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Before X|pg||
nt|phil: was told that he knows Upmark doesn't have shortness|pg||
nt|agumperz:  so he gets the extra 50|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|phil: and an extra IMP if the other table makes 11 tricks too|pg||
nt|agumperz:  sorry, 100|pg||

mb|p|nt|warrens:  and a @S ruff wouldn't have done it either, since then declarer would be able to pitch both @C's on the long @D's|pg||
mb|1N|nt|clinch: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    2@C  for majors    n/s may pinch this in spades|pg||

nt|barnets: another close slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Evening David :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|grebrof: pass|pg||
nt|barnets: which has no play on a @D lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|warrens:  this is slam on a lead.  I don't usually think depending on the wrong lead is a good idea, but I have seen some exceptions :)|pg||
nt|barnets: you see norths imaginative 3! D bid|pg||
nt|barnets: which would not occur to most of us|pg||
nt|warrens:  Fredin likes to bid, as we see here.  with 4 small @H's, he's assuming his partner has a fit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|barnets: yes a spec says hes bidding for the lead|pg||
nt|barnets: eaxcept HES leading it|pg||
mb|5D|nt|barnets: dec has 6 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: that is down 5|pg||
nt|barnets: or 1100|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I rather upgrade my 14 or 17 - allthou you did jackpot in @hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: this may be down 2|pg||
nt|dinos1: -5 with trump lead|pg||
mb|5H|nt|clinch: Will do well to get out for -1 in 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: likely to get club wrong|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes N has implied short clubs|pg||
nt|ady: think 2NT was just competitive   but west decided 3@C better spot|pg||
nt|clinch: Declarer knows S short in @h, so may play top @cs|pg||
nt|clinch: to avoid ruff|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S was very likely to make  so will need to restrict to 1 down for a push|pg||
nt|clinch: but then there's the matter of the third @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  Martel might pull to show interest in slam|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, he did.  he wants Zia to bid 6 with short @D's for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: so e/w exchange 1100 for 650|pg||
nt|dinos1: but would Zia bid 4@h with stiff @d and @cAK?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tez: only 3@d bid could prevent to opps to bid 6@h|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|barnets: I dont believe that for a secon|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: could give 2 heart ruffs now  and 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: oissubly 3 down  3 diamond later promoting Q@C|pg||
nt|ady: possibly|pg||
nt|ady: 3rd diamond|pg||
nt|ady: heart at this point could hardly cost|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|barnets: why should e/w bid slam with absolutely no play|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: now spade|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ady: looks a routine 3NT e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|grebrof: could be lucky the single was vs an ace in @ds, but its stretching a lot - I guess they bid games that they bid at the other table and hope for something lucky to happen|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: yes for a new partnership good stuff|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tez: best lead|pg||
nt|reisig: I love tight matches :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@D would have shown a club void|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: 7 spades wrecked by the 5-2 split|pg||
nt|ady: apart from needing Queen hearts down in 3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|phil: if he ducks this diamond he can go down |pg||
nt|tez: dony play Q of @c pls|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|grebrof: with 3 cards in Ps suit and one sure entry, it looks strange for some - maybe he wants 2 off?|pg||
nt|ady: need control asking bid with hearts agreed to find queen missing|pg||
nt|ady: 11 imps to Fleisher  on hand 28   got to 3NT and make 10 tricks    north raised south overcall of 1NT to 2NT|pg||
nt|clinch: Unfortunately don't know what the EW bidding shows or asks here.... 2@c obviously asking, but not clear after that|pg||
nt|ady: some would bid 2NT with east hand first re-bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Thank goodness for Al Hollander! 2@c= puppet to 2@d, 2@d denied some specific hands, 2NT confirmed 2@c natural and forcing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: the play should be quick|pg||
nt|clinch: Safe spot... W's finessing hasn't been too successful this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: quicker than the bidding :-)|pg||
nt|clinch: He surely won't finesse anything here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||

nt|tez: dony..dont|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|grebrof: he still has to fix the @cs|pg||
nt|phil: hard hand to figure out - 4621 in South is possible I guess|pg||
nt|grebrof: now those on the other table are ordering desert|pg||
nt|phil: I mean, who leads a spade from four with three of partner's suit? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: as long as declarer does not find a backwards @CJ play to pin @CT it is doomed|pg||
nt|grebrof: dessert, yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think you know the answer Phil|pg||
nt|grebrof: you have something called sandcakes (freely translated from norwegiand - dont know if they are international)|pg||
nt|phil: if he reads South for two clubs at most, cashing the Ace 1st doesn't hurt|pg||

nt|xenya: this auction will hardly earn many style points :)|pg||
nt|phil: scores should start coming in for the 3Q: http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|cc469: I will wait with unbridled enthusiasm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: No, appeared to be science followed by a bit of a lunge|pg||
nt|ady: think n/s will get to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I have gotten something like 120 messages about that lead - and, yes - it was shocking|pg||
mb|1D|nt|grebrof: 1@h showing +4 @s|pg||
nt|ady: defence should prevail|pg||
nt|tez: do you open with north hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 1@s now I think|pg||
nt|phil: I suppose x is takeout of spades, instead of just hearts|pg||
nt|phil: in 3rd? why not? |pg||
mb|1S|nt|reisig: YES|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: about the @s lead - we all get inspired at times + it earned an IMP, so....|pg||
nt|phil: there's two ways to play here - one is the 'old way' which x is hearts and 1S is a takeout. The newer way is double is takeout of  spades and 1S is Michaels|pg||
nt|grebrof: http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|grebrof: the live results are dead|pg||
nt|grebrof: or they were earlier|pg||
nt|warrens:  not a great looking 3nt, but they made it at the other table, helped by a @H lead and the very favorable @C position|pg||
nt|ady: 1 spade?|pg||
nt|barnets: there have been 4 major swings in this set|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: 1 spade apparantly some sort of take out bid denying spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  my guess is that Rosenberg raises to 2 and W passes|pg||
nt|phil: declarer can easily go wrong in clubs by taking an intrafinesse|pg||
nt|grebrof: anyone just bidding 1nt at E?|pg||
nt|clinch: EW reached 6NT on 30 in open room|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3rd - yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: after a lot of thought and a jump, rather like here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: i didnt ask east:)north|pg||
pc|h6|nt|barnets: in 3 either a bad slam was bid or  a slam try resulted in going down|pg||
nt|dinos1: N is 3rd in hand :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|warrens:  ok now we'll see if they can make this from the W hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|warrens:  Yes, spectators, I was only half right.  W decided to bid the non-vul game.  |pg||
nt|grebrof: I think W has a nice hand when P can raise to 2|pg||
nt|phil: this looks impossible even if he gets clubs right|pg||
nt|phil: he does know the major shapes of NS - he does not know the minors|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think S comes under pressure on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|phil: to the specs - an endplay gets you to 8 - where's 9? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: but how can  he go wrong in @C?|pg||
nt|phil: by playing North for Tx|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe this time he will play the J?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: now heart entry will go   so even more hopless|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, a grim toil ahead for declarer here|pg||
nt|ady: west can see there will be no entry for the clubs  so easy|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|tez: i dont open with east hand..i would open with N|pg||
nt|reisig: well ..now going down|pg||
nt|tez: SPECS SLEEPING? |pg||
nt|dinos1: def can cash 6 tricks|pg||
nt|tez: sry for caps lock|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 down is 1 imp to e/w|pg||
nt|reisig: Bjorn is a super player!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|warrens:  S can be endplayed twice.  once in @C's|pg||
pc|h3|nt|phil: well this won't do it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if he played a small @C:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  hoping to find AQ of @H's with South|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|clinch: reasonably enough will play for spade to be right|pg||

nt|clinch: so even more now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|clinch: In the other room, they've reached 3NT by S on the A@s lead....not a successful lead|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tez: specs pls join us:)|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|phil: else 2@c+ 3@s+ 3@d+ 1@h? |pg||
nt|agumperz:  but the defense can establish 1@D plus three @C and 1@H|pg||
nt|reisig: Hard to make a bad play here|pg||

nt|grebrof: 1 partscore and the other 15 are games bid - not all made - thats teams all right|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks everyone|pg||

nt|ady: e/w  do well in diamonds   10 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: but easy to see how the defense can stub its toe - it almost happened in the OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ady: 2@S shows spades and diamonds I am informed|pg||
nt|ady: yet west supports spades   maybe thinks AX enough|pg||
nt|tez: 3@c asking 5 card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|grebrof: dbl +4 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H too high    but will east defend|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: not 4-5 spades? |pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl 3@s|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, 4-5|pg||
nt|phil: yeah|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You need a diamond ruff as your 10th trick, so you must hope to sneak a trump through West|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h is contract also in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Also by N|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  well down if defence taps declarer|pg||

pc|cA|nt|Walddk2:  Which Martel did in the open room|pg||

nt|tez: equal..1 down|pg||

nt|clinch: Will need to find @s switch sometime here...will test EW signalling|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|reisig: shift to left foot ...still makes|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h shift wont help|pg||
nt|barnets: why ?|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: what a sneaky way to make 4@S in OR|pg||
