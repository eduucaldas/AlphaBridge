nt|psyck: Spingold results also put up in the bridgewinners site|pg||
nt|ady: easy  4@S e/w|pg||
nt|psyck: to play, if not to bid|pg||
nt|ady: big club opening best if available|pg||
nt|ady: but true  if opening 1@S   could get passed out|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D  ould make   ver difficult to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|an|.|nt|dagold: weak notrump popular in Denmark. In England I think in 5 years it will be a minority system and 10 years mostly wiped out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: North has given them another chance|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt /ew with 24 looks to have some play |pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|dagold: and 4@s hopeless|pg||
nt|dagold: partscore most likely|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  peacefull start |pg||
nt|dagold: 14-16 I am reliably told|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: this hand 2@d would work better rather than 2@h as the good raise as opener on marginal hands can bid 2@h as a sort of last train|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dagold: but of course 2@d would show hearts|pg||
nt|runnerup:  nicely done -will make easyly now|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|ady: nortj regreting balancing|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|ady: no balance in CR   so a good start for Denmark|pg||
nt|psyck: Auken did well not to balance other room|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|dagold: other room NS our playing in 3@c, very different|pg||
nt|runnerup:  he has 9 with @h finess|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|h3|mc|8|nt|ady: ot likey tomake if sades 4-1   so better to have drawn trumps  rther than play diamonds early ad rsk a uf with a defender  ruffing with 2  trumps|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|psyck: dealer appears to be a fan of SDAM|pg||
nt|dagold: 1N 14-16 i suspect but upgraded the 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: 1NT 12-14|pg||
nt|dagold: EW generally play a very agressive style|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  12-15 actually|pg||
nt|dagold: 12-15 im told|pg||
nt|dagold: wrong as usual|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: (6@d always makes)|pg||
nt|ady: good contract as could stlll mae with diamond wrong if defenc does nt cash a heart|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|dagold: routine 4S on this layout|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: east never bid with the 6-5|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal 4 @s with nothing t say|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup:  has to play @c rigth then you have 10  with 5 @c and 2 @s and so -but if he missis @c then he is off |pg||
pc|d6|nt|dagold: say he plays on diamonds then he will need a succesful club guess, likely when south shows up with long spades and 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: in CR south opened 3@H   west 3@S   north pass   east 4@D   raised to 5|pg||
nt|psyck: other room E bid 4@d after a similar start, that jhand cerainly looked worth bidding|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|dagold: easy with trumps 2-2. declarer cant really cater to 3-1 breaks as the heart ruff looms and it would be hard to deal with the 3rd diamond if trumps 3-1|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|dagold: 14-16 nt becoming more common as the modern style opens so many 11s. it now means the 1N rebid is not the difficult wide range of 11-14, but the easier to handle 11-13|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dagold: might try and set up a @h if spades look 4-4|pg||

nt|reisig: on what scale?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1-10|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 bad|pg||
nt|reisig: 8.5|pg||
nt|barnets: the secret is to get to 3N by East|pg||
nt|barnets: hes lucky south has no entry|pg||
nt|reisig: He doesn't know that :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: my humble kibs suggested -1 , 0,5, .... and the others didnt like it either... the 1 @s bid|pg||
nt|reisig: awww|pg||
nt|reisig: if they bid 3N ..what you lead from N??? (w no 1@s)|pg||
nt|reisig: don't all ..answer at once :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so the winning play is @SK and duck spade|pg||

nt|runnerup:  insteadt of 11 |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: either 4@c or 4@d bid by E would have gotten them to 5@d|pg||
nt|dagold: 1 or 5 on west i guess are the mainstream choices|pg||
nt|dagold: second in at red 1 is ok|pg||
nt|runnerup:  no game in teoria but 1 can be bidden|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Ole Berg|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Thx|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  our expert on the EW system|pg||
nt|oleberg:  (My only claim to "fame")|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Ole|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hi all|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dagold: I dont mind opening 5 but the hand is a bit too suitable for 3N|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  cards are blocked nicely but 9 stil very difficult|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dagold: but west with 7@h bids them|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  almost 9 in your hand so 3 @d isn't overbid|pg||
nt|dagold: some play 4@h as encouriging and 4@d as a puppet to 4@h to sign off|pg||
nt|runnerup:  -2 in @h game -so east is not happy to see what is happening |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: 1@S artificial|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: 1@h-1N-2@d-2@h would have been more normal, but N tries a tactical approach|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: looks around 2 down if defence clears hearts early|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@d was a nice bid, created an impossible problem for EW that 1@d would not have done|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|dagold: Wolpert may bid 2D, the hand is quite nice |pg||
pc|hT|nt|dagold: and he is passed|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if partner has 10 of @s -is it too much to expect -you have normally 9 in your own hand|pg||

nt|jbgood: but sabine (auken) and roy (welland) have played quite a lot together - so guess they have an understanding|pg||

nt|runnerup:  why not open 1nt if 14-16|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@C = Transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Always contains diamonds, but strebght may vary|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oleberg:  2@D = Non-exceptional hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2:  Maybe they play 15-17 vulnerable|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe 15-17 in 3rd and 4th?|pg||
nt|dagold: 2@s surprises me|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@S = Doubleton spade and around 10 hcp|pg||
nt|dagold: I would be happy to leave 2@d with that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  3nt in 34 in other table was payed by west and still made because Q92 supricly was a double hold -and declarer took 5 @c tricks|pg||
nt|dagold: no game in their system and I would guess 2@d to be better spot than 2@s on average|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this can be a figth to beat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  yes|pg||
nt|dagold: ah ok 14-16 nv and 15-17 v?|pg||
nt|dagold: makes sense if you dont want to open 11s V|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dagold: 2@c shows diamonds here it seems|pg||

nt|dagold: yes might not be so easy|pg||

pc|h4|nt|hedyg:  team rosters: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2012/02/SPINGOLD/|pg||

pc|s2|nt|psyck: Results, etc. : http://www.acbl.org/nabc/index.php?a=2012&b=Summer&c=daily_bulletins|pg||
nt|runnerup:  to overtake 1. @h was surely wrong -now it looks hmm making perhaps|pg||
nt|dagold: I don't think the heart ace was best but he was desparate to put the trump through|pg||
nt|dagold: I think the defence still in control |pg||
nt|dagold: but had south stayed on lead, defence could get two rounds of trumps in|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2012/02/spingold/  for halftime scores in the Spingold|pg||
nt|dagold: some specs suggest Ace of spades lead, perhaps but the heart sequence tough to avoid|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if declarer gets 1 ruff 4 @s in hand @c ace and 2 @d he makes -but difficult|pg||
nt|dagold: vital he plays low here to even stand a chance, the J or K will probably lead to down two|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dagold: this looks a simple 1 off on top|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal play -if playes small now -will lead to 200|pg||

nt|dagold: no, still down|pg||
nt|dagold: doesnt actually make a difference as north has trump control|pg||
nt|runnerup:  just @c A + ruff 2 @d and |pg||

nt|barnets: as it was|pg||
nt|dagold: so he was hoping for some help in clubs in dummy or wrong lead or simply that 3N was a save on a good day|pg||

pc|s5|nt|runnerup:  6-6 so how to bid perhaps not this way|pg||
nt|barnets: and the pass was a big mistake|pg||
nt|dagold: this is the wrong spot but likely to survive|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe just a simple 4@d to cater for 4@s?|pg||
nt|dagold: north needs to lead the spade King to beat it otherwise the lucky spade poisition lets it make|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|psyck: so the 1@s on deal 3 was NT response...|pg||

nt|dburn: science in use at the other table also, but a shorter auction and a low diamond lead|pg||
nt|psyck: South trying to figure what pd was trying too|pg||
nt|dburn: the Italians have a theory that you lead high from this kind of suit if your third-highest card is the eight or the nine|pg||
nt|psyck: surely the beer card rates more than some measly 8 or 9|pg||
nt|dburn: I do not think they drink much beer in Italy - maybe they have a Barolo card|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Wolpert's conventional options were DBL=@H & @S  NT=@C & @D|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: less so if Bertheau picks out @cA here|pg||
nt|dburn: but no real reason to do that|pg||
nt|dagold: south would surely bid 5@d over 4@h if anyone bid it then west may double|pg||

nt|dagold: i thought it was a swedish method|pg||
nt|pelu:  over 2NT: 3!x= min, 3@D = extra no singleton, 3@h/@s!ut = extra and singletons up the line|pg||

mb|2S|nt|runnerup:  3nt has a play as cards are/ew|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup:  so bid a game is ok|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dagold: unlikely to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  partial -last time when 12 was poss in @d -ew then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how does Amoils convince Wolpert that @SAKJxx is worthless?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  'all'games makes  |pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt /5 @d /6 @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next question:  is there a way to say  i have primary support for both of your suits|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: on the line that you suggested, some cross ruffs & then East under pressure|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: 4@h did make on 12, so 11 IMPs to Amoils, who could use them|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: other table  45  EW weren't in that auction either|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dagold: and they are in it next door|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: 1@C could be 2|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N made in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: their south introduced another variation by overcalling 1@h you can decide which overcall if any you prefer|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  4 @h looks difficult -3nt makes if you guess rigth minor finess|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|runnerup:  yes 4 @h makes sorry |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, unbal  4+@D, maybe longer @C|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N EW is a make on the nice diamond layout|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lucky 3nt |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|dagold: 4@h looks easy to me|pg||
nt|dagold: diamond going on 3rd spade|pg||
nt|dagold: south made an interesting play of the @d K on the last hand. hoping to shut out the diamonds if declarer had say xx|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@CXX would have been exciting|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some dont like to take funny points like 2 @c XX|pg||
nt|dagold: surprised W didnt try 2@c with super max hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  46[5@DN=]  Welland in 3@C south after opening 2@S|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|dagold: in 3N you need to take right minor suit finness|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe play say @c Q from dummy and if it is not covered, rise ace and take the diamond hook|pg||
nt|barnets: i think souths xx asked for norths major and north forgot the system|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: I think North bid 2@S over rdbl|pg||
nt|dagold: but north has shown clubs of course so  not likely|pg||
nt|barnets: aha |pg||
nt|dagold: a squeeze/ endplay possible if north has both kings|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: 2@C was @C and a major|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north has bid 2 @c so @d finess must be odds in the end|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps just play a couple of rounds of hearts and exit with a spade|pg||
nt|dagold: then north must give you a 9th|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so this was a shortcut -in table north bid 2 @s |pg||
nt|barnets: yes that looks right david|pg||
nt|runnerup:  maybe endplay -after 5 @h play @s is best as sayed by audience|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  In the other room 2@D was a bad overcall with a major|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2008worldmindsportgames-beijing/openteams/denmark/Askgaard-Bjarnarsson.pdf|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: David alreay gave the best play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: even with diamonds wrong  ok|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|barnets: you dont want to cash your hearts and play spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if north has AKxxx in @s you have 100% -like take 3 @h and play @s -north is endplayed|pg||
nt|barnets: as your own hand is squeezed|pg||
nt|dagold: 3 rounds of spades would have been a better start but then the diamond finness makes it|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dagold: cash maybe 2@h then you can throw 1@h and say a diamond on the 4th and 5th spade|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|runnerup:  so Danish bid them selves out of game by opening 2 @s /s (not so great but still) |pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ritong: some play that three @h|pg||
nt|barnets: East has a good hand now|pg||
nt|ritong: as opposed to direct 2@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not all that sure I'd have bid 1NT - most of the time partner has five diamonds, but maybe 2@d is too discouraging|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd prefer 1N  ...to 3@d|pg||
nt|barnets: how about 3@D|pg||
nt|jbgood: anything to 3@d...|pg||
nt|phil: East is close to a Bloomer over 2@c - lack of a real trump suit is a concern|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|barnets: I tink 3@D is real close|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the lie is pretty friendly - this will probably make|pg||

nt|phil: 4045? |pg||
nt|barnets: sorry my partner has|pg||
nt|bigtrain: everything sits well...  i think overtricks will be made|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|barnets: I like 1@S to show usually 5@D|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|phil: so you'd open 1@c with 4=1=4=4 Barnet? |pg||
nt|dburn: I don't think West can have a balanced hand for this - the only time 1@d is three is when 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|dburn: so 1@d-1@h-1@s is five diamonds and four spades - or the dreaded 4=1=4=4|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  I didn't (know)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|oleberg:  Seems logical to have the weak hand bid NT on the hand-type that is least likely to end up in NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: more of an issue with relays than right-siding contracts|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe 3@h by north? stiff heart would worry me, but perhaps this is too tough|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: more IMPs to Amoils when Denmark bid 6@d rather than 6@s and did not find Deep Finesse's line|pg||
