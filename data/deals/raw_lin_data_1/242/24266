nt|dagold: 14-16 nt becoming more common as the modern style opens so many 11s. it now means the 1N rebid is not the difficult wide range of 11-14, but the easier to handle 11-13|pg||

nt|phil: yeah thats better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: more discussion about opening lead style - from 9x they would lead the 9, so I guess that DelMonte knows that N has the long clubs. Now he asks "and from 4 small?" "4th" so he ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: definitely knows|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|phil: now Askgaard can rise and give a club ruff, but now S is exposed to a ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed it  1 trump then @S  improves on immediate @S  but i don't think it matters on this layout|pg||
nt|phil: if he ducks, S returns a trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Askgaard picks up opponents' convention card to look at something - don't know what|pg||

nt|dburn: but South couldn't envisage a slam, though six diamonds is not too bad|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@c min i suspect, 3@d asked, 4@h no short no side ace or similar i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: correct|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: not many raise with 3 card trump support these days|pg||
nt|psyck: i thought many do raise|pg||
nt|dburn: three and a side singleton not all that uncommon, but North is top of the range for that|pg||
nt|psyck: 2N generally ask for the kind of raise|pg||
nt|barnets: I dont see much play in 6@D looks like a trump and spade to lose|pg||
nt|dburn: still, bidding 2@c and then 3@s was perhaps more of an overbid than 2@s was an underbid|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, with bal hands, few would raise, but with shape, & when you have methods to clarify the raise, it works well|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|psyck: yes @s was a better slam, & making as cards are|pg||

nt|barnets: i think souths xx asked for norths major and north forgot the system|pg||

nt|dagold: but north has shown clubs of course so  not likely|pg||
nt|barnets: aha |pg||
nt|dagold: a squeeze/ endplay possible if north has both kings|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: 2@C was @C and a major|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north has bid 2 @c so @d finess must be odds in the end|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps just play a couple of rounds of hearts and exit with a spade|pg||
nt|dagold: then north must give you a 9th|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
