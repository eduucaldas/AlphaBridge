nt|xenya: declarer could afford 2nd round of trumps since even if they were 4-1, 2 rounds of diamonds would assure 10 tricks on most layouts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in last 10-15 years  District 9 [Spector] has been clear leader|pg||

nt|athene: tricky hand; only one quick loser but still some work to come to ten winners|pg||
nt|athene: you win this in dummy and...? lead the @SK? lead a club?|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|athene: he may have been planning to ruff a diamond with the @HA but now he will change tack|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: throw one club on the @SQ, lead a club up, play for @CA right, so you concede club and @DQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|c5|nt|athene: the trouble is you might get forced trying that anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: no, it is the best shot surely - defence can't force you twice in spades|pg||
nt|athene: everyone was calling for the @DJ at trick 2 but declarer does not know the queen is right|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with running that is that if it loses you get another trump back|pg||
nt|athene: and you are a lot worse off|pg||
nt|davidstern:  Yes but if it loses what can East Damage you with|pg||
nt|athene: because you might not be able to ever get a spade trick|pg||
nt|davidstern:  You may be able to pitch dummy's club on a third diamond|pg||
nt|athene: you are short of entries to set up a spade AND cash it, and you are not getting any profitable ruff either|pg||
nt|athene: yes but even if you do manage to throw the club, and ruff one club|pg||
nt|athene: that is only 5 trumps + 3 diamonds + 1 ruff = 9 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: unless you take the ruffing spade finesse first and that works|pg||

nt|athene: entries to hand might be slightly tricky|pg||
nt|athene: you could try club to ace, spade to queen|pg||

nt|fabsayc: that is still only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: well then you maybe just play @CK, club and finesse diamonds then spades later|pg||
nt|athene: that would be wrong if the @DQ was offside but the @CQ onside, though|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think you can really afford to run the @CJ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but check Daily Bulletin -- possible earlier start times that aren't reflected in BBO |pg||
