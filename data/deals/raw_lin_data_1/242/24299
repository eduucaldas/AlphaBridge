mb|1N|nt|kit: 3@C inv. looks about on target with West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: A @d partial here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: 1 IMP til Heimdal, men mer må til. Mer må til for begge lag. Tromsø er etter medalje om de kan knuse Heimdal her. For Heimdal kan det bli alt eller intet|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: i assume this is a 15-17 NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: N-S play precision, E-W play 2/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i only have very old CC for NS   says  "NASZ SYSTEM"|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|p dalvi: good morning every body|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: critical which major South leads, but no real reason not to lead the known 5-card suit|pg||

nt|geot: Evenstads 2@C melding var god, gjorde det vanskeligere for N/S|pg||

pc|d4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S = "negative dbl" but 0-3@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|p dalvi: multi version |pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: Ajay is fairly conservative here, many would have chanced 2@c O/C with his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  1@S possibly transfer to 1N    oh for a current convention card :(|pg||
nt|ady: with good eyes can land 4@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|p dalvi: 2s = @D |pg||

nt|andyv:  1NT with 5 card major becoming less unusual...I do like to have 3 cards in the other major however|pg||
nt|rv: JM started with 2@c hoping to bid smolen 2@h if Ajay had bid 2@d|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, they will surely land in 3@D|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|rv: Meenal, any idea about scores after 3rd round|pg||
pc|h3|nt|p dalvi: probably use H relay and show 24-25|pg||
nt|indianidol: scores after 3 rnds : azure  59, poddar 49, indiablues 46,  nest inn 41  , cabal 36.|pg||
nt|rv: Kirpa's 2@d is aggressive O/C, he must have bid based on white position|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: ty Mahesh|pg||
nt|rv: Ajay's 3@c possibly shows 5M, JM has possibly forgotten sys|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks like that|pg||
nt|andyv:  however no hard done although missed a good slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  no harm|pg||
nt|rv: JM plays with too many diff partners and this is not his preferred treatment, he plays 2n to show 5M min and 3M to 5M max on 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  and stayman used to be so easy:)|pg||
nt|rv: Ajay plays 3m to show 5M max hand and possibly shows 2n to show 5M min hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|indianidol: Welcome Rv|pg||
nt|sunit:  will make on a heart lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|reisig: :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|p dalvi: north 5 -7 bal or c suit well not my style all J and Q|pg||
nt|rv: this could be costly even at these colors|pg||
nt|rv: double dummy defense can possibly take it 4 down?|pg||
nt|rv: this deal good for neutrals and supporters of Azure|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will net 10 tricks...if you are EW you have to hope 6@s isn't bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|geot: Det meste går galt for Heimdal nå. I det forrige spillet endte det med et rutervalg som gikk galt, og nye 11 IMP til Tromsø som kan presse trondheimslaget ut av pallen om dette ...|pg||
nt|geot: fortsetter|pg||
nt|arunbapat: Venkay's 4D instaed of 3C would have put lot of pressure on E.|pg||
nt|rv: good afternoon Arunji wlc|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|grebrof: Kristiansand er på 2dre nu|pg||
nt|kit: I must say I can't find the attraction of a spade lead from the North hand on this auction.|pg||
nt|kit: Still, very difficult hand to play -- not many losers, but where are 9 winners going to come from?|pg||
nt|reisig: Might opt for the @h finesse and xruff after|pg||
nt|kit: so that would give him 2 spades, 2 hearts, 1 club -- he would need 4 trump tricks.|pg||
nt|kit: I guess they are there|pg||
nt|kit: But he might instead go for ruffing finesse in hearts -- and that would fail and defense can draw trumps|pg||
nt|reisig: It's still better than the 3@c contract in open room :)|pg||
nt|kit: One argument for direct heart finesse is that it is easier for South to shift to a diamond than North, particularly since North didn't lead one to begin with suggesting a dangerous ...|pg||
nt|kit: holding.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|p dalvi: he could bid 1@S and final con remains same |pg||

nt|kit: This lead makes things easier.  I know the books say not to lead singletons with 4 trumps, but that doesn't mean the books are right.|pg||
nt|kit: Even now, diamond shift could create problems|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe declarer should have led 10 of spades, not jack, since he would prefer spade to be ducked.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pass|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|rv: in seniors Bowl last year, Indian seniors represented by Ruia, Archie, Lal, Subhash, Kamal Roy and Ashok Vaidya narrowly missed qualification to QFs|pg||

nt|bigtrain: all direct bids are natural david|pg||
nt|ady: so what is re-double?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: either pointed or rounds|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer knows N has 5 @H, so AQJxx likely, so I think he'll win the @S and take a @D finesse|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|reisig: Back to 110|pg||
nt|kit: Since North can't get in to cash the queen of diamonds, it looks like contract will still make -- 4 trump tricks, 2 heart tricks, and 2 very slow club tricks.|pg||
nt|warrens:  he doesn't know that trumps are so friendly|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: South will probably exit with a trump|pg||

mb|p|nt|kista:  kamal is very careful in this vul.  Many would open 1 or 2@h here |pg||

nt|reisig: Another "exciting" hand :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: tough bidding problem for Agarwal here|pg||
nt|kit: seems okay to play low at trick 1 -- can always play South for QJ of spades later if need be|pg||

pc|h6|nt|p dalvi: south axe as expected I think 4 @H is not there with C misfit |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: we need to have more bbo pens in the future and hand them out to these experts. that very dark ink makes it easier to read for vugraph operator :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|leo lasota:  perhaps Nickell tries for jack hearts here with the hope of finding Katz with something like A9x, but Gordon could still make in that case by ducking the jack hearts and blocking the suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|reisig: Now = a duck and maybe safe play in @cs finesse into "safe" hand|pg||

nt|rv: Buddy Shah and Ms Meenal Thakur are our excellent Vugraph operators|pg||
nt|rv: IOC-Indian Oil Corporation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: 3 minutes break|pg||
nt|p dalvi: NS game and perhaps sacrifice in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: players have taken a break here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Gordon: good defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 23   Monaco 21-3 set over Cayne     playing the SAME boards as our match|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|rv: slam time here|pg||
nt|andyv:  Azure picked up 7 imps on board 19 when CR played 2@hs|pg||
nt|rv: not easy to reach slam and may not make as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|kista:  NS may have a 5 level decision here over 4@s|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|rv: JM's double shows majors|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this pace feels more natural than yesterday's turtle run |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam ?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 5+@S GF or 11-13 balanced|pg||
mb|d|nt|p dalvi: partial gain NS on 2S board  brd 16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other match pushed 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: meck calls director...unhappy with explanation of dbl...speaking privately with director|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter  does 1@S still ask about @S after DBL|pg||
nt|ady: in spades  would need heart finesse   7 trump tricks 4 clubs and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H showing 8-11 random is part of meckwell lite...  this is full blown RM Precision which is much more complicated|pg||
nt|bigtrain: XX is penalty|pg||
nt|bigtrain: Pass asks clarification|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but i suspect he'll bid 1NT with the potential big @S fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: play resumes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ok...  i'm finished with lunch... i'll be alot more attentive now  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|p dalvi: 17 sry|pg||

nt|ahollan1: now i'm hungry|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: N-S might run into trouble here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C would show spades and be natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  22  Pratap in 4@S East|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i assume that will be his choice|pg||
mb|1S|an|5+s, 8+|nt|vugraphzeq: sorry all|pg||
nt|rv: I presume double shows majors and Venky 1@d shoes suit and no interest in majors|pg||
nt|p dalvi: ashim may not agree to it :)|pg||
nt|rv: now declarer should get @cs right, but he might get @ds wrong|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S shows @S|pg||

mb|2D|nt|bigtrain: 1@S shows spades|pg||
mb|5D!|an|excl rkc|nt|arunbapat: just 2S by Ashim was surprising|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D   excusion ?|pg||
nt|ady: exclusion|pg||
nt|bigtrain: although i'm surprised he didn't bid 2@C which would show both @S and @C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D = exclusion RKC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: showw all keycards BUT the @DA|pg||
mb|6D|nt|geot: må slippe hjerteren nå så vinner han 2NT|pg||
nt|sao: her blir det vel 8 røde stikk å 120..|pg||
nt|kit: East wondering if 3NT might be better than 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult to determine, since he doesn't know if West has any heart help and how can he find out?|pg||
nt|ady: might bid the grand    at worst on a finesse?|pg||
mb|d|nt|geot: med tre hjerterstikk og fem i ruter. Forsvaret kunne ha tatt fem i kløver og spar ess|pg||
nt|arunbapat: 4S dbl will go down 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Anand's redouble shows values, semi-bal hand|pg||
nt|rv: defending these 1 level contracts is never easy|pg||
nt|kista:  Venky has a decent hand here.... but dbl says "want to do something"|pg||
nt|warrens:  8@D is a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: responses to ALL RKC and Exclusion  0314|pg||
nt|warrens:  Walter, X=exactly 2 or is it 0/2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = DEPO  ??    [dbl = even KC  pass=odd]|pg||
nt|bigtrain: depo|pg||
nt|bigtrain: so 0/2/4|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|rv: Iyengar's 3@h show @h values, when opps have bid/shown 2 suits, bidding 3rd suit shows values|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like he decided that he couldn't find out.|pg||
nt|warrens:  opponents are bidding @D's and have X'ed @H's.  I think Meck will try for 7.|pg||
mb|6S|nt|p dalvi: well diff contract |pg||
nt|rv: if opps have bid 1 suit, bidding that suit usually asks for stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common to play  DEPO when bidding is beyond 5 of your trump suit otherwise DOPI   [maybe that should be D1P2 with regard to steps]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|arunbapat: rdbl shows 6+ and says he can penalise at least one of the Major|pg||
nt|rv: many times declarer gets away with 1 or even 2 more tricks than deserving|pg||
nt|rv: Iyengar will bid slam now|pg||
nt|reisig: 420 seems likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Seems normal after this lead for North to play ace of hearts and a heart, hoping South has king of hearts and a trump trick.|pg||
nt|yusufb: a.nedim:)|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe there are other possibilities, but that seems most straightforward.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: short break after this hand|pg||
nt|ady: could Rodwell have had only 4 spades on the auction?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kista:  a deceptive lead by Kamal|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was 6@H just Last Train?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5+@S promised|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: meck: good luck... or maybe bad luck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: director called|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i certainly don't blame roddy for not bidding grand...  he has essentially shown his entire hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except for @C suit and short @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: rodwell asks whether he can see south's written explanation...he can (showed @hs)|pg||
nt|warrens:  Rodwell would have bid it with an extra trump or an extra @C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there is only one step available so 6@H has to be a general try not a specific question|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: good start to defense so far|pg||
pc|c5|nt|geot: nå blir det en bet. |pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|vugraphzjm: players hv taken 2 mnts break here|pg||
nt|p dalvi: yes lead may have told to do otherwise|pg||
nt|kista:  Declarer got deflected into believing that LHO cannot have two singletons !|pg||
nt|kista:  A sure loss for NEST|pg||
nt|kista:  Very imaginative lead by Kamal|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 4@H = out!!!!!!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: Kripa must be shaking his hand before placing dummy:)|pg||
nt|kista:  Venky had a 2@c bid here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W did not bid his cards to the best advantage|pg||
nt|kit: My personal preference is 2@S, since major suits are where games are.|pg||
nt|reisig: With that suit - I'd prob X|pg||
nt|kit: Winning ace of clubs at trick 1 looks very dubious to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: wow|pg||

mb|1C|nt|rv: Indian Open team comprises of Manas, Subir, Sumit, Laltu, Sandip Dutta and Amarnath, they won trials in Goa last month|pg||

mb|p|nt|exerdar: undo pls|pg||
nt|rv: winner of this event will join above 2 teams and represent India at Lille in WMSG from Aug 9-23|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Ton is a fantastic guy apart from being the world wide authority on Bridge Rules|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14+ hcp and good meld|pg||
nt|ady: lot of spade wastage   possible to go down or make 6NT  |pg||
nt|kit: slam is poor, but it makes on a winning diamond view.  Very hard to stay out of.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S = 5+@H or minors|pg||
nt|kit: However, I believe leading queen of diamonds first (planning another finesse) is percentage play, since that picks up K10xx as well as K10x|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT forced|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@S = 5+@D 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other match Zimmermann-Multon in 6N   Helness-Helgemo 5@C+2|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 5+@D 4+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|p dalvi: sry next match |pg||
nt|sunit:  difficul to bid but 10 tricks can make on a club double hook since heart ace onside|pg||
nt|sunit:  absolute anti percentage game spades behaving with aj onside too|pg||
mb|4C|nt|p dalvi: 2@d= H oe single suitor M ?|pg||
nt|kit: Playing in 6@C, might steal a heart past South and then pitch the losing hearts on KQ of spades|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S was the correct choice to show this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|exerdar: kuzeyden 4@d |pg||
nt|reisig: But 4@h is reasonable - just doesn't make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this will miss a 5-3 @D fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but its is an easier path|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT show 3=3=3=4|pg||
nt|ady: K107X   cant run whole diamond suit   but 3 tricks enough for 6NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C was mafia baron|pg||
nt|bigtrain: basically looks for 4-card fits|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzeq: :(:)|pg||
nt|p dalvi: missed |pg||
nt|runnerup:  same bidding in both rooms up to that point /3@h -east final bid here was extra -other east passed |pg||
mb|p|nt|p dalvi: 3NT does not look east though |pg||
nt|p dalvi: easy sry |pg||
nt|rv: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  this time 3N works well|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 14+ balanced|pg||
nt|kit: West has concealed his shape, so greater chance of stealing the heart trick in 6@C (assuming spade lead)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 2@H can they ever stop below 4N?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@C was a @C fit not good enough for RKC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S is a Q-bid|pg||
nt|kit: what is 4@S?  Just his best Q?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@D would have been RKC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4M = Q|pg||
nt|kit: So West knows off ace of hearts and king of diamonds then, so will probably stop.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: so 4@S isn't good enough for RKC and lacks @H control|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sao: ny dobbel score nå|pg||
nt|exerdar: 2pik kaptýrmaz ise 4@d= oluyor|pg||
nt|rv: can declarer play for 2 down here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: oh right -- so he doesn't know about diamonds, but the 4-3-3-3 is a downer since needs both king and queen of diamonds.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4NT = NF|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 5@H I really don't understand|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|rv: coffee deal here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 35-13 set for Monaco with 2 to score   Monaco over Cayne by 37|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our other room playing 27|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Session 3 will begin at 4:30et|pg||
nt|kit: There is a possible end-play.  It involves taking ruffing finesse in hearts, eliminating South's red suits, cashing ace of clubs, and throwing South in with a spade|pg||
nt|kit: And in fact, declarer might find it on the bidding info he has.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  make mine black, pls|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: The other room seems to be getting slam decisions right... bd24 and 25... but they sort of cancell each other out|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: mine with whiskey for irish pls|pg||
pc|c4|nt|reisig: @d 2 = @c's|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: that was a great play if he had cashed 2nd diamond|pg||
nt|kit: Still effective, but doesn't break up the end-play anyway|pg||
nt|ady: but still ok  as cant get to dummy in time to discard other diamond|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer goes right after hearts, he can still do it I believe|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|arunbapat: matter of OT|pg||
nt|kista:  4@H |pg||
nt|runnerup:  norh didn't want to defende -why -not easy to see-ok no one doubles fo penalties nowadays|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h6|nt|kit: What is this about?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|geot: Ja, det er 30 og 31 som klart er potensielle gevinstsill for Tromsø, mens spill 32 er et bra spill av N/S her|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: always easier from here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: also Mj Hooda's decision to directly bid 3 nt with the 4-3-3-3 hand gave Azure a well deserved 10 imps on bd 21|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe because the expert/mindreader is commentating here. :)|pg||
nt|rv: many winning decisions at other table, here N-S bid a good 5@d though|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: Rodwell apparently thought North had KQ tight of clubs, and was trying to maneuver a trump end-play against what he thought was 4-1 trump split.|pg||

nt|kista:  ew can make3N here|pg||
nt|andyv:  light opener again by E...W will have to fly low on this one|pg||
mb|1N|nt|reisig: I didn't expect a 2@s bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I can see the logic -- he was playing his partner for Qxx of clubs and a quick trump trick.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzhb: Evenstad, som spilte med Stokkvik i 1. halvrunde spiller nå med jan Einar Sætre|pg||
nt|geot: Situasjonen er at Heimdal må snu denne kampen og helst vinne stort for å gå forbi Bergen Akademiske som spilte jevnt med Lillehammer i første halvrunde|pg||
nt|p dalvi: hope they reach via trf 2NT|pg||
nt|reisig: Gordon has an easy Pass|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so north doesn't mind -he has @s -and ns will find a nice place to stay probably|pg||
nt|reisig: May shoot for 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: which he might make|pg||
mb|p|nt|sao: misstilpass som ender i noen beter her..|pg||
nt|geot: Men det er flere poeng, Kristiansand lurer like bak Heimdal i øyeblikket og kan kapre sølv|pg||
nt|sunit:  negative x better with the east hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjm: He had touched dbl card 1st then changed his mind|pg||
nt|rv: 1 level too high once more|pg||
nt|andyv:  scheduled for down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit:  on this deal it does not matter cause 4sp makes but better to protect the west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Dessuten kan Tromsø om de knuser Heimdal ta medalje, og Studentene er også i bildet for medalje|pg||

pc|h3|nt|p dalvi: Kamalda not happy with his @S holding |pg||

nt|ahollan1:  28 [6@CW=]  Gordon-Pratap  1@D-3N//4@C-5@C//6@C-end   so all depends on how Gordon plays @D|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: neb = nebulous = 10-15 hcp, 2+@D [neb because may be 2@D 5@C]|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  somehow NS bought the contract for 3@c in OR|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: I mean that the most difficult partner to play with is one who sometimes underbids and overbids at other times|pg||
nt|reisig: To me that K10 of @s is pure gold |pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok -some other name for that convention maybe used but i think he has shown @s and @d here |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|grebrof: Tromsoe må ha 23VP for å gå forbi Heimdal - det begynte kanskje bra|pg||
nt|andyv:  bergan raise here will prevent that from happening again|pg||
nt|reisig: Now 4@s = 6-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|kista:  Here Kamal bid 2@c and not 3|pg||

nt|andyv:  could be either judging from hand:)|pg||
nt|reisig: 6@d is not impossible to bid|pg||
nt|reisig: Tough to bid 6 after they X 5@d :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  slam on cards -so double is not timed well -of course if you see your teammates bid a slam -hmm --just a joke|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: levin writing questions - pratap writing answers - can't see them unfortunately|pg||
