nt|bigtrain: i'll guess 4S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: sort of optimistic, since even opposite a 5-count might not have much play|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge responded 1N with south hand|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this will probably depend on the heart suit|pg||
nt|kit: this will depend upon which heart finesse he takes with his one dummy entry -- I imagine he will get it right due to the overcall|pg||

nt|bigtrain: certanly east's initial pass will come into play|pg||

pc|c2|nt|kit: this I don't like -- and it will cost him big time|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d presumably a help suit kind of bid & with a doubleton & 4th trump, W accepts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: free Q finesse and two diamonds away|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|dT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- a second trump trick plus the timing for more ruffs, gets declarer up to 10 tricks I believe|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh  i also missed @C discard|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d2|pc|sQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious hand - maybe discarding two hearts on the @cAQ would have been better, as @DJ is onside|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|an|FG, 2+ !cs|mb|p|mb|3C|an|extra values|nt|xenya: so 2 thin 4@S contracts bid and made in both rooms -- exciting start to the match|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: but they were aware of the misfits i think, so stopping short of slam of slam looks reasonable|pg||

nt|oosmanb: I dont know how good 6@c is. even with @c 2-2, you need the @D finesse? |pg||

nt|bigtrain: i think that is the winning line mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but discarding the diamonds looked a normal enough thing to do|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psyck: In the other room, Martel bid 3@h instead of 3@d, & playing there|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: it would be pretty double-dummy, as crossruff line works when trumps split|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed - so easy when you can see all the cards|pg||
nt|bigtrain: didn't say it was right...  just winning :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: what does Glubok bid now?|pg||
nt|kit: even then not so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Their 1@h must be pretty sound if this is a fav vul 2@h for them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well --- i didn't expect 2@C from Woolsey|pg||
nt|kit: possible 6@C here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possible 6@c here EW|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: I prefer a splinter 3@H with West hand -- as long as you are raising, why not describe?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|clinch: Well now NS are California, EW NY - ahe bidding looks a bit better :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hedy suggests their 2@h may be an intermediate hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  50  2@S made in other room|pg||
nt|kit: Now he splinters -- seems like a strange order to do things|pg||
nt|kit: lucky to get the chance when East happened to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|kit: But now have to start the slam exploration a level higher|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: sorry  down in other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this side of the pond 2@c doesn't promise the earth, so 3@h would be aggressive with poorish spades |pg||
nt|kit: some say that maybe 3@H wouldn't have been a splinter in their methods -- certainly possible|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the problem is that RKC is too high now |pg||
nt|bigtrain: or at least it may be|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I don't understand the logic of the double of 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West can redouble |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 w/othe queen forces a poor slam then|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like it just gives the opponents more room|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: hi Krishna|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, that's assuming 4@H is a splinter -- it might have been RKC|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well they found 4@S    please don't ask me how|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Whatever it all meant, East did drive to slam|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: Slam far from cold, but cards lie favorable and I think any reasonable line of play will make|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|clinch: Innocuos board to start - three obvious losers|pg||
pc|s2|nt|clinch: innocuous even|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|kit: One possible danger is if declarer takes a crossruff approach, he may at the end try to get back to his hand with diamond ruff instead of spade ruff.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smith in 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brad Moss raised to 2@H rather than Lev's 1N|pg||
nt|kit: But declarer will probably be trying to set up spades first, and will get the news there|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: wonder if S will withhold the J|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: Now nothing can go wrong that I can see|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe North should have foreseen this problem and led 9 of clubs to protect his partner's holding.  Not at all obvious.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|psyck: result for the 1st couple of boards we missed have been entered|pg||
nt|clinch: You might even bet that this would be identical at any table|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: i'm absolutely sure that there is no clearcut bid for west after partner overcalls 1@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|oosmanb: North got off the hook|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Glubok asked something (I think whether pulling the DBL showed a bad hand) and Spector says "no ... if I bid immediately over the RDBL it shows a weak hand"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if Lev consistent -- 1N   then what does Woolsey do?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: The bidding box on the table shows N is the dealer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  1N ended the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that's not good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: so the bidding starts with N opens 1@C|pg||
nt|nelson_dev: that was very nicely played|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: no splinter (if that is what it was) in the other room|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: Looks as though 4@s, if reached, will fail here, certainly if played by W|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: please ignore the first pass by W|pg||
nt|odysseus70: alam|pg||
mb|d|nt|odysseus70: makeable exremely dubious slam|pg||

nt|kit: sorry, meant 2@C|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|psyck: other table reached it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe pass implies Strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: & they should here too|pg||
nt|psyck: the strongest hand is probably the last one to get into the action here|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: South will likely rebid @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: 2N looks like strongly invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: @d would have been a normal lead except for the 1@d bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, so let's see - will take a bit of making|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead should get defense 2@s, 1@h , 1@c tricks|pg||
nt|kit: East has the right type of strength for double I think -- not enough for slam, but enough to expect to get more than value of game|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: other room south lead a @c after a similar auction|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, likely to play a @s to K or Q|pg||
nt|psyck: yes it should be in this seq after xx 1st|pg||
nt|kit: I like this opening lead -- who needs to lead sequences?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: looks like 4 digits|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|clinch: Club followed by a @d may still beat it|pg||
nt|psyck: looked like max passed hand with no fit kind of bid|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 11 or 1400|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East's bidding normally indicates a pretty strong desire to defend|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: prblem with @c is that declarer may be able to set up a @c trick for @h pitch|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|xenya: so it's either 3@D or 3N -- i'm surprised at S's pass |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, we were all expecting 3@d with South's hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: Those using the Browser version of BBO have the option of listening to Hedy & Andrew on voice commentary.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: hmmm|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|kit: no need to play trumps, as no ruffing threat|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: adamantly believes in bidding with shape|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|clinch: Now just down in top tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 1N should make so down 1 is a push|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the initial double was thin but normal - pretty severe outcome though|pg||
nt|kit: Jack of hearts is onside, but declarer can never take advantage of it -- so will get only 2 more tricks|pg||
nt|kit: so will be 9 more IMPs to D24|pg||

mb|3D|nt|kit: which he might have done at favorable vs. strong club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: OR auction direct and to the point|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell will get to 6@H or 6NT -- doesn't want to play 6@D since king of spades would be led through|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) FG  b) 22-24 BAL|pg||

nt|bigtrain: although the oother hand usually does|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Just 5 black suit losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge also opened 2@C  but i think his 2N rebid will be 20-21(22)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell writes a whole paragraph on 6@H which I cannot read clearly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if S does bid 7@d (probably won't) West had better lead a spade|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Meltzer: carding? Polowan: standard, Smith, o/e discards|pg||

nt|clinch: Yes that may work|pg||
nt|psyck: so 6NT would make too similarly|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|xenya: and you always get 2 trumps at the end|pg||
nt|kit: other room result of 6@S doubled looks like a very likely place to end on this hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would be 4+@H  NOT normal negative dbl|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C would show the reds and 2NT would show more of the reds|pg||
nt|kit: E-W may not have agreements on meaning of double by East here|pg||
nt|kit: Could be important for him to show his spade support|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: not sure how Martel shows 4-fit with strong NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D?|pg||
nt|kit: This could be support double -- but does West know that?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: depends on agreements|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: South will probably bid 4@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lilienstein: 2NT? Meck: reds|pg||
nt|kit: And now the bidding escalates|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: but then, of course, i may be missing something deeper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S would just be unbal min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i'd be wrong|pg||
nt|bigtrain: when eric came up wit the idea of support X he played them through the 4-level|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no support passes only occur at the 1 and 2-level though|pg||
nt|kit: Still don't know if it was support double, as West would bid 4@S regardless with his hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the OR North bid up to 6@d all by himself|pg||
mb|5D|nt|clinch: Though 3 makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: North will certainly get to 6@D -- the only question is whether he gets there fast or slowly|pg||
nt|bigtrain: walking the dog?|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: and is actually a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|kit: I guess it was support double (at least East thinks so), since if he hadn't shown support he would surely have bid 5@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and led ace and another heart, too - well done|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ahollan1: so maybe like Kaplan-Sheinwold   2@S = 4-fit BAL strong NT OR 4-fit unbal [so re-evaluates to extras]|pg||
nt|kit: And now the 6@D bid|pg||
mb|6D|nt|Vugraphzfc: Smith alerted 3@C but Moss did not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without RHO interference  they can differentiate|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: good lead|pg||
nt|psyck: it is a strange bid indeed|pg||
nt|kit: Well done by E-W|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't 7@D make?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a good idea on these types of hand is to simply aim to become declarer |pg||

pc|c2|pc|sJ|pc|c5|nt|psyck: maybe N had a 2N bid on 1N with extra intermediaries|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but check Daily Bulletin -- possible earlier start times that aren't reflected in BBO |pg||
nt|bigtrain: forces 3@D for a description|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Couple more IMPs to Larsen on 28 when E chose (correctly in my view) to pass 1@h|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bigtrain: "forces" 3@D since if opener bid 2@H he can still have @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|an|3!Ds|nt|ahollan1: we have seen a ton of close vugraph matches in USA recently|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: He'd do well to pass here too|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: vul   pass doesn't seem likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 4m ok sac nv|pg||
nt|kit: I know most would think the South hand not a weak 2 at this vul, but might have been quite effective here -- would either East or West have bid?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|clinch: 3@h might fail as declarer can't get to dummy for a trump finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all i had to do was wait 5 seconds   to not look like idiot|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck: true but not easy to defend & they may give entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: boring hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a bit quacky, but the suit is decent enough |pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: not available...  2@H would have been intermediate|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bigtrain: rusinow lead from known length|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1st and 2nd seat 2@h=4414 10-15|pg||
nt|bigtrain: oh you're talking about a 2@H opener...  that would have been weak|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but remember i said meckwell are very conservative preemptors|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: but a quick one|pg||
nt|kit: I was talking about original 2@H opener, yes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|psyck: the 3rd & 4th session will start 30 mins earlier than scheduled|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, apparently my system notes for NS are out of date :(|pg||
nt|kit: I'm not suggesting it is a percentage action -- only pointing out that on this deal it might have been effective.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Polowan: signals? Rodwell: upside down|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|clinch: In truth I think they'd defend it right, but we shall never know|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: i know they don't play Gazzilli, but not sure if NS use any version of Bart|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: was too busy typing to see he was first seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS convention card from 2009 Bermuda Bowl   http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2009worldteams-brazil/bermudabowl/usa2/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: soon we'll have the 2012 version for the upcoming World Mind Games  [is that the right name for what used to be the Olympiad?]|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: yes   NS do play modified bart|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|psyck: will go for -2 or so i suppose|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: but that only applies after 1@S-1N//2@C|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: oh, bidding still on, but will go for a number whereever they land|pg||

nt|ahollan1: plus score is good - i read that somewhere|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Last board this segment, thanks everyone :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd set scheduled to begin in about 20 minutes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psyck: they are all quick, other room half a dozen boards behind|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|clinch: May only be -1|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thank YOU Eric|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb:  OUTSTANDING JOB, Eric. Loud appreciative applause|pg||
nt|kit: Not a great slam looking at N-S cards alone, but with West opening the bidding it becomes a great slam.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks you Henry :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: but still a swing to tighten the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still playing weak NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: :)|pg||
nt|kit: Now a splinter by North, and maybe ????|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Polowan left the table for bathroom|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and now everyone left |pg||
nt|bigtrain: most who play weak NT do not play support X|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they use the X to show the strong nt|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ive been trying to drag you into the 21st century for quite awhile henry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: players are back|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: Thanks Eric, Vlad, Hedy, Andrew, David, & kibs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: NS making 4@h here |pg||
nt|kit: here is my suggested splinter -- now will South cooperate?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be worried about his realtively poor trumps|pg||
nt|kit: 4@D by South might be RKC.  Walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: any 6 trump is good opposite 4+ trump :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: 1N=NF  a) 2/3@H, Strong NT  b) 3@H, not 4@S, unbal  c) 4@H, 15-19 HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: N will want to bid now|pg||
nt|kit: If South does make a move, North can bid slam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: 1@S asks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17 NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: double seems to express frustration at the bidding here|pg||
nt|clinch: Hmm.... that double isn't my cup of tea|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C PUP 2@D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: will show 5@H invite|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: Would 4@C by South have been forcing Walter?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=5+suit, INV|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 2N would show exactly 5@H invite|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: i might have reopened with a double with the N hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they really don't spend too many bids for slam after overcalls|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: @CK offside, 3 trump losers   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't see any way to avoid any of that|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|psyck: can W be squeezed for an o/t?|pg||
nt|clinch: yes|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|bigtrain: its tailend of the bell curve stuff and they don't feel its important particularly|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: and i would have been wrong :(|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  63 [2@DN=]  Wooldridge in 1N South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never thought to examine that contract :(|pg||
mc|12|nt|bigtrain: no 4@C wouldnt be forcing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: excellent set of boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: see you all later!|pg||
