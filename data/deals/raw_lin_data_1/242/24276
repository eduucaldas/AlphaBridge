nt|warrens:  transfer has gotten this to the right side.  but will they bid 6@D on a finesse? |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  this looks like a poor slam if you think W has values for his overcall|pg||
nt|warrens:  but, it's Fredin, so the @H King is 50-50 :)|pg||

nt|warrens:  the wheels really came off here.  what was he playing North for?  A, KQxx, KQJxx, xxx?|pg||
nt|pef: I think Mike Kamil decided that Marty had at most 3 black cards on that auction|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|warrens:  or maybe 4-6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pef: yes, that's my guess|pg||

nt|pef: and it still is :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: 3c is a really aggressive call vul. when partner could easily have nothing|pg||

nt|pef: as you can see in the closed room, 3c, despite a pretty suitable dummy, went down 3|pg||
nt|warrens:  Graham, you're right that 3@C is very pushy by West, but Fredin likes to bid|pg||
nt|phil: he probably thinks clubs are 6-2 here|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||

nt|pef: although if he does he'll make 4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hA|pc|s8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|phil: he doesnt have much choice except not to guess spades - cant pick up Kx once he ruffs hearts|pg||
nt|pef: right, with the ace of hearts pitch, he thinks he may have a problem because clubs might be (probably should be) 6-2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  I think he can now cash @H's and play W for Kxx or Kx of @S|pg||

nt|phil: claim was +600 - quite possible there was a collective Sominex coup|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|reisig: That was the "REAL" lead??|pg||
nt|grebrof: we havent had one partscore making enough tricks for game yet at this table, so they are more afraid of losing a game than bidding too hard at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: 7 spades wrecked by the 5-2 split|pg||
nt|ady: apart from needing Queen hearts down in 3|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|grebrof: with 3 cards in Ps suit and one sure entry, it looks strange for some - maybe he wants 2 off?|pg||
nt|ady: need control asking bid with hearts agreed to find queen missing|pg||
nt|ady: 11 imps to Fleisher  on hand 28   got to 3NT and make 10 tricks    north raised south overcall of 1NT to 2NT|pg||
nt|clinch: Unfortunately don't know what the EW bidding shows or asks here.... 2@c obviously asking, but not clear after that|pg||
nt|ady: some would bid 2NT with east hand first re-bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Thank goodness for Al Hollander! 2@c= puppet to 2@d, 2@d denied some specific hands, 2NT confirmed 2@c natural and forcing|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: the play should be quick|pg||
nt|clinch: Safe spot... W's finessing hasn't been too successful this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: quicker than the bidding :-)|pg||
nt|clinch: He surely won't finesse anything here|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|grebrof: as we say in Norway: "Maybe if I had bid @s?"|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|grebrof: he still has to fix the @cs|pg||
nt|phil: hard hand to figure out - 4621 in South is possible I guess|pg||
nt|grebrof: now those on the other table are ordering desert|pg||
nt|phil: I mean, who leads a spade from four with three of partner's suit? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: as long as declarer does not find a backwards @CJ play to pin @CT it is doomed|pg||
nt|grebrof: dessert, yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think you know the answer Phil|pg||
nt|grebrof: you have something called sandcakes (freely translated from norwegiand - dont know if they are international)|pg||
nt|phil: if he reads South for two clubs at most, cashing the Ace 1st doesn't hurt|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|pef: people have asked for the link to all the results.  There are two places to go--the ACBL web site and bridgewinners (well at least two places)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pef: the acbl pointer is http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2012/02/spingold/|pg||
nt|kit: This will be in 3NT, and heart lead through ace of hearts would create entry problems|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: But 3@H is transfer to 3NT -- very successful here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: the bridgewinners pointer is http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: Somehow I don't think Fredin will find king of hearts lead|pg||
nt|ritong: he prefers going for the secret weapon|pg||
nt|pef: doesn't a diamond lead beat it right away?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: yes diamond lead would have been better|pg||
nt|ritong: and the @s jack is good news, so far|pg||
nt|pef: looks like a spade lead is by far the worst for the defense, actually|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Kamil sya "thinking"|pg||
nt|kit: I think he has to win this for fear of diamond shift|pg||
nt|ritong: first he has to determine what is going on in this @s suit|pg||
nt|ritong: only one thing is for sure, west has not stiff @s AQ|pg||
nt|kit: if spades are 3-3, then winning king of spades is fine.  If spades are 4-2, not clear.|pg||
nt|kit: Good point -- East couldn't afford jack from J10x|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||

nt|xenya: this auction will hardly earn many style points :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|clinch: No, appeared to be science followed by a bit of a lunge|pg||
nt|ady: think n/s will get to 3NT|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|grebrof: I have gotten something like 120 messages about that lead - and, yes - it was shocking|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 1@h showing +4 @s|pg||
nt|ady: defence should prevail|pg||
mb|2C|nt|grebrof: 1@s now I think|pg||
nt|phil: I suppose x is takeout of spades, instead of just hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|grebrof: about the @s lead - we all get inspired at times + it earned an IMP, so....|pg||
nt|phil: there's two ways to play here - one is the 'old way' which x is hearts and 1S is a takeout. The newer way is double is takeout of  spades and 1S is Michaels|pg||
nt|grebrof: http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|grebrof: the live results are dead|pg||
nt|grebrof: or they were earlier|pg||
nt|warrens:  not a great looking 3nt, but they made it at the other table, helped by a @H lead and the very favorable @C position|pg||
nt|ady: 1 spade?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 1 spade apparantly some sort of take out bid denying spade|pg||
mb|2S|nt|warrens:  my guess is that Rosenberg raises to 2 and W passes|pg||
nt|phil: declarer can easily go wrong in clubs by taking an intrafinesse|pg||
nt|grebrof: anyone just bidding 1nt at E?|pg||
nt|clinch: EW reached 6NT on 30 in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: after a lot of thought and a jump, rather like here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  ok now we'll see if they can make this from the W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  Yes, spectators, I was only half right.  W decided to bid the non-vul game.  |pg||
nt|grebrof: I think W has a nice hand when P can raise to 2|pg||
nt|phil: this looks impossible even if he gets clubs right|pg||
nt|phil: he does know the major shapes of NS - he does not know the minors|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think S comes under pressure on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|phil: to the specs - an endplay gets you to 8 - where's 9? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: but how can  he go wrong in @C?|pg||
nt|phil: by playing North for Tx|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe this time he will play the J?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: now heart entry will go   so even more hopless|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, a grim toil ahead for declarer here|pg||
nt|ady: west can see there will be no entry for the clubs  so easy|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|jaapfr: i expect a push though|pg||

nt|ady: like|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|warrens:  S can be endplayed twice.  once in @C's|pg||
pc|cA|nt|phil: well this won't do it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if he played a small @C:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  hoping to find AQ of @H's with South|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|clinch: reasonably enough will play for spade to be right|pg||

nt|clinch: so even more now|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|d5|nt|clinch: In the other room, they've reached 3NT by S on the A@s lead....not a successful lead|pg||

nt|kit: Good point -- spade shift may be difficult to find.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|phil: so Fredin's 2nd diamond should tell a story - Kit, what do you think his spots mean? |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: some suggesting suit-pref on 2nd round of diamonds.  But is it so clear for East to cash a 2nd diamond?|pg||
nt|pef: thanks all for watching.  and thanks to bbo and the acbl for making this all possible.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|phil: it seems safe - a pitch off the @dQ cant really help declarer|pg||
nt|kit: So far so good for the defense.  Now, we will see about the suit-preference|pg||
nt|phil: now the picture is clear|pg||
nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: about @ds, yes|pg||
nt|phil: unless North went for a deep falsecard with Qxxx, although I do not know EW's carding|pg||
nt|kit: Wasn't obviious to me -- there are 4 weak spdes in dummy which need to be disposed of, so a pitch can be valuable|pg||
nt|phil: it really matters if 2@s was just @s or has a minor too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: they only whisper so I have no chance to tell|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: Seems like he should get it right now|pg||
nt|phil: and as a spec says, North really looks like a man with the @sA for his opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: fredin looks askance|pg||
nt|kit: but he didn't.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||

pc|hA|mc|11|nt|phil: in the other room Willenken carded @d5, 8 and Rosenberg shifted|pg||
nt|pef: in the close room they did find a switch to a spade after cashing two diamonds, so this will increase the fleisher lead|pg||
nt|phil: 10 more for the ledger|pg||
nt|pef: so three big swings in the last few boards to fleisher|pg||
nt|phil: even 11|pg||
nt|phil: thanks all!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: they said 5: 5Hs + 6Cs|pg||

nt|ady: n/s have 4 losers in hearts or clubs|pg||

nt|ady: e/w  do well in diamonds   10 tricks|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|3S|nt|ady: 2@S shows spades and diamonds I am informed|pg||
nt|ady: yet west supports spades   maybe thinks AX enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: not 4-5 spades? |pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl 3@s|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, 4-5|pg||
nt|phil: yeah|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You need a diamond ruff as your 10th trick, so you must hope to sneak a trump through West|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h is contract also in open room|pg||
pc|dA|nt|clinch: Also by N|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  well down if defence taps declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2:  Which Martel did in the open room|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|phil: you can reverse the dummy somewhat but the wrong hand has the 4th club|pg||
nt|ady: 14 imps to Fleisher on 31   made 3NT   when down 3 here|pg||
nt|clinch: Will need to find @s switch sometime here...will test EW signalling|pg||
