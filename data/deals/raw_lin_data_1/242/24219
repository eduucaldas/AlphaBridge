pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF lead is singleton  E has no re-entry for 2nd ruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's main concern is to conceal the position from east if the lead really is a singleton|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room declarer played low in dummy and dropped the 10 under the king|pg||
nt|athene: maybe dropping the jack is better - you would be more likely to run the lead to a stiff jack than a stiff 10 i think|pg||
nt|athene: (you are trying to make east think his pd led from 10xx or Jxx so he doesn't return one)|pg||
nt|athene: but since the defence have no fast tricks to take in either black suit, east will probably just play the diamond back whatever|pg||

nt|athene: a club now i would think|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a @h|pg||
nt|athene: even if east wins the @CA and exits a diamond, you can cash a few diamonds and exit a heart which will hopefully endplay east to give you a ninth trick|pg||
nt|ritong: good idea, although if so east has no reply to a @h right now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: what could happen is west has ducked the @d and waits with polenty of establishable @cs|pg||

nt|bigtrain: surprizing how disruptive a 1@D overcall would have been there|pg||

nt|xenya: declarer could afford 2nd round of trumps since even if they were 4-1, 2 rounds of diamonds would assure 10 tricks on most layouts |pg||

nt|athene: declarer might have @HAQx or @HKQx|pg||
nt|athene: or even @HK9x |pg||
nt|athene: a heart winner in declarer's hand might be used to pitch a diamond or spade from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand leading a diamond might let declarer throw one of dummy's hearts on one of his diamonds|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe if they have some lead directing implication to the trump spot leads it would help|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he can draw many inferences from the opening lead; north would not want to lead a heart from any broken holding on this bidding|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @C off and @D?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: among other things   @C puts north under pressure|pg||
nt|athene: same start in the other room; south played ace and a trump to stop diamond ruffs but that gave away too much|pg||
nt|athene: double-dummy declarer had to duck that @SK to make legitimately, apparently; must be some exotic things going on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would 2@H be opening bid if 1st/2nd seat??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're discussing that in voice commentary|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps you can put pressure on north in the black suits in an ending |pg||
nt|athene: but you need to save the @SA as a dummy entry to do that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary available via  browser login OR without login using http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lev took 8 tricks even after @C9 from smith|pg||
nt|bigtrain: re: weak 2 with 4card other major...  its all about suit quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  maybe north needs a croc coup on 2nd round of @D|pg||
nt|athene: ok i had a bit of a look and i think if declarer ducks the opening lead, he eventually ruffs down the @CA and has the @SA to reach the @CK|pg||

nt|ritong: noone knows @s K was a stiff|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think this is unfindable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i got a play analysis right!|pg||
nt|athene: north really wants to get the lead, although he then still has to decide whether to play a spade or a trump through|pg||
nt|ritong: sout is known with 5@cs, likely 4@hs and likely too @s KQ|pg||
nt|athene: a "crocodile coup" is where a defender goes up with a big card from a tenace in second seat|pg||
nt|athene: to grab the lead and stop his partner being forced to win the trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not @SKQ else (2@H)-2N|pg||
