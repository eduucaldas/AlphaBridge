nt|sybarra: gm Walter,  welcome |pg||
nt|bigtrain: although to be honest i'd be disappointed in missing either :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: good morning shirley|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this hand is totally routine to bid the game...  the south hand being a 6-loser hand is a clear jump raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is patton, and we need someone else to explain  it is not played in USA |pg||
nt|sybarra: combination of matchpoints and imps |pg||
nt|sybarra: that is about as much as I know |pg||

nt|sybarra: I even played it once in Neth.  and still do now understand it  (even though we did well) |pg||
nt|sybarra: that was suppose to be do NOT understand it |pg||
nt|sybarra: at first you have to count imps like bbo show us and in second time you have to count point for each board 0 if you lose 1 if it is egal and 2 if you win|pg||
nt|santyclz: Each match of 4 hands is worth 16 victory points.  BAM results are scored 2vp for a win, 1 for a tie.  IMP results are converted into vp with 8 pts divided between the two teams.  ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: (A difference of 10 pts is considered a tie for BAM.)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so it is combination of imps and board a match |pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Joe :) |pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Shirley, Walter, folks.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hiya joe|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Do not look at the final results. Each match is independant : 4 boards and the result is a combination of imp's and boards wining points|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are waiting because there is a movement of the teams |pg||
nt|sybarra: each match 4 bds |pg||

nt|ady: we have only 1 regular tournament in U.K like this   called Lederer Memorial  held at Young Chelsea    slightly different    we call it point a board|pg||

nt|hedyg: i have new info saying it is not BAM but Patton meaning:|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which is slightly peculair, as there are in fact two points a board|pg||
nt|hedyg: each board is compared as pairs (as in BAM, so 2-0, 1-1, 0-2) and the four boards are also compared in IMPS. With IMP comparison  so you can have 8-0, 7-1, 6-2 etc|pg||
nt|ady: how many imps for 8-0?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no idea, have been searching :(|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: easy one to play|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|an| |mb|3C|mb|d|mb|3D|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: No alert so this would seem to be a weak 2 rather than a major/minor two-suiter.  N would probably not allow 4@s to play in the latter case.|pg||

nt|ritong: and, if south is declarer in 3NT, he will|pg||
nt|ady: west forced to duck otherwise 4 hearts 3 clubs and 2 diamonds    if west ducks  cam then play on spades making 3 spades 1 jeart  3 clubs and 2 diamonds|pg||
