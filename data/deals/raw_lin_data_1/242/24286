nt|ahollan1: Weichsel can relay [2@C] or show game force raise with any singleton [2N]|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10*-15 HCP, (a) 6+@C, 1-suit  (b) 4+@C & 5+@S    [10* = prime 10]|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7|nt|ahollan1: Hampson's 2@C was always 6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what Weichsel does now   2@H=nat, NF  which seems wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how they play DBL by passed hand|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe North should play ace and a spade rather than finessing, but that was not completely clear|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: i think DBL initially tries to clarify 1-suiter vs 2-suiter|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@c strong, 1@d not strong, 1NT majors I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 4@D puts NS under lots of pressure with nothing clarified yet|pg||
nt|dburn: normally, I guess, that pass would show a minimum balanced hand, but Greco may be hoping that Hampson can start doubling things|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe he can, at that|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: or maybe he can't, so we will never find out what would have happened to Weichsel in 2@s doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: surprised he stuck his neck out vulnerable, but the desire to mess up the opponents' strong club auction still burns bright|pg||

nt|dburn: in that Greco and Hampson have reached something they would never normally have reached - they'll make it anyway, but another IMP for enterprise to Weichsel|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: director has been called over to adjudicate|pg||
nt|dburn: if Greco thought (or was told) that South could have clubs and/or whatever, 5@d makes a lot more sense|pg||
nt|dburn: but Greco is the same side of the screen as Weichsel, so he at least would be told what Weichsel actually had|pg||
nt|dburn: Hampson, who isn't, might have done something other than 2@d though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: then they all took a bathroom break|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: quite right - leave the constabulary in charge, for well it was said by the bard "when constabulary duty's to be done, a policeman's lot is not a happy one"|pg||

pc|hK|nt|barnets: after @SQJ|pg||
nt|dinos1: W will be endplayed in @d's|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he should duck|pg||
nt|kit: Which declarer understandably did|pg||
nt|barnets: west can always get out @CK |pg||
nt|dinos1: then @c's will be set|pg||
nt|dburn: after all, if declarer is locked out of both hands, maybe he can lock the defenders into one or the other|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: hampson forehead on table|pg||
nt|kit: Ducking now works best, but it is tempting to win and hope there is heart blockage|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe if he ducks west now plays a club|pg||
nt|barnets: hows that ?|pg||
nt|dburn: no idea - I suspect only GIB knows, and I refuse to ask it|pg||
nt|barnets: good answer|pg||
nt|dinos1: duck to Q, @sA, @hA, @dA, @sQJ, @dQ - the play for 5-2 in @h's|pg||
nt|barnets: by playing a club after the @H duck it avois the problem of 5 tricks on |pg||
nt|barnets: well that is double dummy|pg||
nt|barnets: and I ont think dec will do that|pg||
nt|barnets: more likely @CQ @SA @DA @SQ @SJ @DQ|pg||
nt|barnets: then west plays his heart|pg||
nt|dinos1: wont @c shift show @h's are 5-2?|pg||
nt|kit: Note that dummy has 2 of clubs if declarer needs to exit to West hand in some end position.  I don't think it will come to that, but it is worth noting.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: pity Peter Weichsel, who has to work out all this stuff without seeing all 52|pg||
nt|dburn: but my guess is that if he makes it somehow, he is very likely to be facing more problems tomorrow|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he got the hearts right (after playing the queen), but I don't think that will be good enough|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||

nt|barnets: I dont think he can make it without cashing it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|kit: He clearly has to cash it -- but then he has to judge to not take diamond finesse|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dinos1: if @c then low @c|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: if it feels like room is getting crowded -- the other table finished play a while ago|pg||
nt|dburn: neither do I, but cashing it looks hors categorie to me|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like he was basically playing for 10x of clubs|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|barnets: very unusual hand - to make it dec had to basically strand himself from both hands |pg||

nt|dburn: they may be unlucky|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: Counting winners, declarer has 4 spades, 3 clubs, and 1 diamond, so he needs 2 heart tricks.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: let's hope not|pg||
