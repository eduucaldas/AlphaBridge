mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: Welcome back everyone. |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: to the 2nd segment of Cayne-Zimmermann|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day all|pg||
mb|p|nt|osvaill83: probably start with a routine 3nt :)|pg||
nt|kit: hi Danny|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to bid much higher|pg||
pc|hA|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H not at all forward going|pg||
pc|dT|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||
nt|phil: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|phil: same lead in OR|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't expect 2@s from S|pg||
nt|ritong: the contract does not present any choice|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: that seems to have helped EW find the game|pg||
nt|barnets: and 4@H is a good contract|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfv: all the way up?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: this will take a lot of good guessing to make|pg||
pc|s7|nt|phil: Rosenberg ducked, diamond returned...not that anything really matters on this layout|pg||
nt|barnets: making most of the time when opener has @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: East really had a 3@H bid countng @SK as a trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||
nt|riccho:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012Dublin/systems/OpenTeams/Monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: can get out for -2|pg||
nt|ritong: so first blood to zimboum|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: and he is likely to get spades right|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||
nt|pelu:  CC for EW: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, not sure if there are comentators|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|barnets: in fact in other room east cued an raised to 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling and bidding over a minimum response already showed a big hand...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||
nt|barnets: a big diff in valuation |pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: levin says "we should just play open notes"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hello. only score is accurate cos we started late|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: players cracking jokes about their no trump overcalls|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria cued and bid 3@H closer to the valuation I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: so what to open on an 8-4 :)? |pg||
mb|1N|an|15-bad 18|nt|phil: you don't see these hands in textbooks|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
nt|ritong: multon will find this weird, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann thinking about a major lead, asks if 1N can contain a 5cM|pg||
mb|p!|an|misclick|nt|barnets: so 4@H in open also|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
pc|hA|nt|phil: Zimmerman had to be tempted to bid 6@d here|pg||
nt|phil: it cant be that expensive, and who knows who makes what? |pg||
nt|phil: yet, partner's 5@d made them guess|pg||
nt|phil: maybe East should x 5@h?  he has some surprise defense|pg||
nt|phil: although I'm not really clear what a w/w 5m opening is supposed to show|pg||
nt|phil: but definitely not KQTx in a side major :)|pg||
nt|phil: NS appear to have four losers, but it seems like they would have a hard time taking all four|pg||
nt|phil: give east Axxx of clubs, and 6@d actually makes - but so does 6M (probably)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: do we know what fleischer's double shows|pg||
pc|h4|nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
nt|phil: this will compress one of the losers|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
nt|ritong: there is room for one jack in multon's hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: I don't think W can try 3N, will likely bid on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: at that point, nothing makes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: he does not know partner has just 1 club|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to stop in a @d partial after 2@c anyway|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: I think Martel will just come back a spade -- bigger danger declarer has ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just penalty worth hand|pg||
nt|ritong: your lead, michael|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fell asleep|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: must've not caught the 1@S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|barnets: and is hoping clubs run|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: zimmerman double was either brave or foolhardy|pg||
nt|ritong: a small swing to fleisher, presumably|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: south might pass other room, 1NT west swish  @s lead 90|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|kit: wrong again|pg||
nt|phil: so an undoubled vulnerable save against a making 5@d'|pg||
pc|h7|nt|3for3: even playing 0/2 leads, wouldn't know if his honor was Q or K|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, this speeds things up.|pg||

pc|dK|pc|s4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||

pc|cT|pc|dT|nt|xenya: i'm really surprised W didn't bid 6@D|pg||
nt|phil: my daughter was getting her wisdom teeth out during the 1Q - looks like I missed some interesting boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: very interesting boards on the 1Q|pg||

nt|phil: oh|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, 6@d is definitely possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: against a very weak nt, after norths double transfer bids by south give more options|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: laughter about how they have special double cards for penalty and marked ones for takeout|pg||
nt|ritong: cayne does not open these hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|multi|nt|3for3: ew might sniff around at slam here|pg||
nt|phil: I like 1@d. I loathe 2N|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he was afraid of pushing NS to a makeable slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi again|pg||
nt|psyck: NS CC: http://usbf.org/images/conventioncards/cayne-seamon.jpg|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: as I said before you arrived - Multon's 5@d have his opps a tough guess - and they might have guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|phil: *gave|pg||
nt|ritong: guess multon will opt for 2@h|pg||
nt|ritong: his game prospects are thin|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|kit: They have a lot of high cards for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *just -1|pg||
nt|ritong: nonetheless...|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if Kamil bid 5@d (and why shouldn't he?) the spades would have been buried|pg||
nt|phil: now Zimmerman can pattern out|pg||
mb|3S|an|max, 6!H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: they like their 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will keep them out of any slam|pg||
mb|4H|nt|3for3: true, but from helgemo's POV cant east hace a stiff club?|pg||
nt|barnets: this a better 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he though partner had heart support I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 5@H was a bold bid, in the jaws of unfavourable vulnurability |pg||
nt|phil: yeah - along with some nice defense too|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: solo|pg||
nt|xenya: all in all well done by both sides on the last hand|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|phil: 4@h does not handle well|pg||
nt|phil: he's tapped down to parity at T1|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike 4@S?|pg||
nt|phil: if hearts break OK, he can manage 4H + 5S + 1C and doesn't need the club hook|pg||
nt|phil: in spades can't you take 5S in hand, 3 ruffs in dummy plus two aces? |pg||
nt|xenya: unless they lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: in the other room, N didn't get in -- still, S found a @C lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: he can, but even then there might not be 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|phil: yes that may cause difficulties - but maybe declarer can make something out of the heart suit then|pg||
nt|ritong: awful hand to lead from|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|3for3: q of clubs was the q of hearts, and slam is laydown|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "We have some bad news" - Cayne|pg||
pc|h7|nt|barnets: 6@C poor contract|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|kit: I don't really see What Helgemo can bid but 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are in sync with open room, almost equivalent auctions|pg||
pc|h4|nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe 5@S, focusing attention on club control at the slight risk of going down there.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: but the finesses are in :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|phil: so there may be some counters - hard to say who comes out on top|pg||
nt|phil: but overall 4@s looks worlds better than 4@h|pg||
nt|phil: ruffing looks a little better here - the diamond suit is tied up if he does|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ritong: in reality, zia passed the 12 count as east, south opened 1NT, was left there and apprently made 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they |pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart lead needs a red king guess and club guess|pg||
nt|psyck: likely down as may not take @c fin|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfv: 1 less finesse needed|pg||
nt|barnets: the percentage in clubs is from the top|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: in any case, i wholly agree with what you said about the 2N bid, Phil -- E's hand just doesn't qualify|pg||
pc|s5|nt|phil: but if he draws the last trump, what does he pitch from dummy? |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|psyck: excellent, then went up from 25 % to 50 % :)|pg||
nt|ritong: cayne: "ow"|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|phil: now the hand falls apart|pg||
nt|xenya: W"S rather|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: it is clear for him that declarer would never find the @hs by himself|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|sT|pg||
mc|10|nt|ritong: so his lead was not as neutral as it looked|pg||

nt|3for3: the danger of 3d round overruff if partner has xx of clubs and no jack of spades is quite real tho|pg||
nt|barnets: note Cayne played low on club without a flicker|pg||
nt|barnets: you might ask why helness crossed to dummy|pg||
mb|1N|nt|barnets: to lead @CJ|pg||
nt|psyck: he was prepared to play low during the bidding itself|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: no superfluous conversation in this room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all very focused|pg||
nt|phil: in the other room in 4@s, declarer started to finesse in clubs, and then chickened out - South ruffed, returned a trump, and that was that|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@S in the other room, Rosenberg opted for a very unfortunate line|pg||
nt|phil: but he will be pleased to learn he won 3|pg||

nt|3for3: missing a pass|pg||

nt|phil: 3N is excellent NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many possible bids by south|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: I agree -- that's why I think he has to just bid 4@S and hope that if East has a stiff club he can make a move.|pg||
nt|phil: but 3@h is in 800 country|pg||
nt|xenya: yeah|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: both 3NT and 5@d make here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C by helness?|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|phil: wow Multon doesn't even consider 4@c|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT having the advantage to score 630 if they do not cash @ss|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: jokes all across the table|pg||
nt|psyck: ruffing a couple of @c's would work here, not clear what is best|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: N is not concerned about hearts here, rather about the quality of the 1D suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: just a spade doubleton and some aces|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some confusion over the x? |pg||
nt|phil: double these days generally means anything but penalty|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s= " i need help in that suit buddy"|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria- versace did well to stop in 4N on last board|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|3for3: a variation of 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|barnets: going beyond 3N looking for slam |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny says "i dont have much help" as she laid downdumy|pg||
nt|psyck: @s shift could have fetched 1@s, 3@d, 1@c to def, but now declarer has a chance again|pg||
nt|barnets: he is not cold in even  4N though as misguessed the clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: he still has to guess @h fin to get rid of @s loser|pg||
nt|barnets: and needs heart fin to make|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: 4@c= "get lost"|pg||
nt|ritong: or something like that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a "buddy" bid|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: double was a @H stopper ask|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: Declarer has problems here.  Even with the clubs coming in, there are only 8 winners.|pg||

nt|psyck: @h fin needed this deal & in 4NT other room :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so first big swing for Cayne|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|phil: so why 5@d??|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: french word is " coopératif"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or we use to call it a west coast cue bid (asking for half stopper)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|3for3: quite thin game.  needs clubs to behave, 44 diamonds for starters|pg||
nt|3for3: and 9th trick to come from spades.|pg||

nt|grebrof: @H K|pg||
nt|kit: If East does shift to king of hearts, declarer will definitely win the trick|pg||

nt|grebrof: Zia should stop playing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia: "I knew I could make it, I Just didn't know which chance you gave me"|pg||
nt|phil: but there's always that sequence where there's a little fuzziness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@D was preemptive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not constructive|pg||
nt|phil: they play transfers there kendrick? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in what sequence?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: the 3@S?|pg||
nt|phil: after the overcall - pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not that I know of|pg||
nt|barnets: the specs have a treat today with almost certainly 3 of the world's best teams in the semi-final|pg||
nt|barnets: an unusual occurence|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I wonder how they'd show a constructive raise then? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: they possibly could, but I'm unsure|pg||
nt|phil: no worries|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I thought NS played Flannery....I'm confused now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think, multi|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
nt|phil: kind of a wacky multi opener red/white - maybe trying to create a little early action|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: the "lost track" part may occur a lot, unfortunately, as these ladies at times play with supersonic gusto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thinking|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is generally 'transfer me' and 4@d is 'you bid it' - which Kamil will do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it will work out|pg||
nt|phil: looks like he wanted to protect any diamond cards in Marty's hand|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman has the world's fair on this auction|pg||
nt|phil: now - Zimmerman should be less excited about playing hearts now|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d advertises length in both|pg||
nt|xenya: if he bids 4@H, he will make it|pg||
nt|phil: NS can make a lot of sapdes however|pg||
nt|phil: I think they bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: assuming it gets passed out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Zimmermann in the tank. |pg||
nt|phil: 4@h is a little awkward to play - but I think South has the option of losing one of his trump tricks or allowing the diamond pitch to be taken, right? |pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C doesn't look too bad either -- until you see the whole layout|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, hearts that are "Hawaii" (5-0) is very bad for both|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps just an interesting, how do you stop 4@s? |pg||
mb|1D|nt|kit: Interesting -- so Zia didn't work out that West could dodge the end-play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helgemo embarassed he threw his @H away|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|phil: I would take dbl of 4@d as 'cards' and a subsequent x of 4@s as penalty|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: now 5NT or 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades are shakey, i think 4 enough|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D seems a tad conservative with that fine 46|pg||
nt|phil: Multon not excited about defending 4@s with his paucity of defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: action!|pg||
nt|phil: aieee|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder Zimmermann was in the tank -- the whole auction looks crazy, from his perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all purpose DSI double (do something intelligent)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H seems right for north on that basis|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: he might be afraid North has just hearts|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: no oops here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the downside of the upgrading craze occurs on hands like this|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: well 3 is down a lot but a deep position|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, imps do not grow on trees|pg||
nt|ritong: down 40 or so|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: with 12 boards to go...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny has to use the restroom. the rest are waiting for her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson left with her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers started reading the newspaper|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: real news, not bridge news. hope she doesn't get distracted by all the crazy stuff happening today :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually i think she's doing the puzzles. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson seems a very friendly chatty person. she's back now.|pg||
nt|kit: now this bid I don't understand -- seems like clear 3NT call by Zia|pg||
nt|xenya: N might pass  now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: well, north is a PH, so with just hearts he can just bid them, either a weak 2, or 2@H at second turn|pg||
nt|phil: Lightner from Fleisher now? |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: granted this is not a normal situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in that case why not 3nt by rosenberg|pg||
pc|d9|nt|phil: a quick -2|pg||
nt|phil: Kamil will also rip 6@h|pg||
nt|ritong: 6 losers at first glance|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: good point Danny -- I forgot about initial pass|pg||
pc|dT|nt|grebrof: what to bid than 2@d?|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil knows Fleisher is ruffing the heart, so his lead is suit preference|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: So here we have another close 3NT contract|pg||
nt|3for3: entry problems for the 9th trick, even if the clubs are 33.|pg||
nt|phil: don't they lose a diamond too? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ending in 2nt has no upside|pg||
nt|ritong: are you absolutely sure to want to lecture rosenberg about imps tactics?:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: i always bid 6nt if close|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and here danger of a bad spade break makes 6nt my choice|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|grebrof: @d to 10?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i do think if your going to swing you need to start early, and 3nt is the best contract for that tactic|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ok|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: they are guessing contract in our room (with no success)|pg||
nt|ritong: unkind @d|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||

nt|yusufb: salvonunda yaptýgý tam ipnelik bu 2 oldu bana|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: looks like down 2 from here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: might ruff honor, and finesse the J@S?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: @Cs offer a better chance|pg||
nt|kit: if clubs 3-3, opponents can't cash 4 tricks |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 3 off -- there's a @D to lose as well|pg||
pc|h6|nt|grebrof: the 3 wins, npp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: it was correct|pg||
nt|kit: East didn't squander 8 of clubs on 2nd round of clubs|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck: S can exit in trumps again when in with @sa, but ewill be endplayed again, but that will still be 8th trick only|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: almost certainly|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: I assume this is operator error with the club spots|pg||
nt|grebrof: for me, the operator is god - I dont know what happened :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, after the 2@C fuss, i might have gotten lost|pg||
nt|pelu:  for sure @c 10 8 left in East|pg||
nt|grebrof: Helness in the tank now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: he 100% led the 2@C|pg||
nt|kit: I imagine East won 8 of clubs on 3rd round, continues hearts, and goes down some|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: she wrote "when shifting to singleton against preempts..."|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since I can't say anything nice, I won't say anything|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this hand is as close to ideal if your ever going to do it|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will make life easier for declarer, as he will prefer to finesse the clubs rather than try to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|kit: I must admit I don't understand making deceptive leads in the blind like this.  Seems too likely that they will cause partner to misjudge the hand.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: kamil has wondered for a moment if he was good enough for 4@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sounds like you're here watching it with me|pg||

nt|ritong: multon does not double 6@c|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard likely knows about his @s void anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i was lost in another auction, yes 5@S denying queen, so now 6@C has to be offer to play|pg||

nt|henryb:  which hand is too large?|pg||
nt|henryb:  which lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the lead in this match|pg||
nt|xenya: actually could have been 4 if S had discarded a club and a diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: I must say I hate the pass of 1@SX|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: we resume|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: cayne didn't look too happy seeing that pass. |pg||
nt|psyck: neither the x nor the pass were pretty|pg||
nt|rimbus: declarer would play well to play the king with K9xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: try for game opp 20-21 2nt?|pg||
nt|ritong: to morrow, west will have 5 @hs and it will work|pg||
mb|1N|an|10- bad 13|mb|d|nt|phil: re|pg||
nt|phil: I think so|pg||
mb|r|an|2 suited r/o, force 2!C|nt|xenya: is E worth 2@H here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: yes, sorry, i was trying to read their alert sheet|pg||
nt|phil: the question is will NS compete to 3@d|pg||
nt|barnets: some may open 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: Cayne could bid 2@s or something with a 2 loser hand & @s void, & of couse S need not have passed with that hand|pg||
nt|barnets: opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|3S|nt|phil: if Fleisher has @d's, great|pg||
nt|barnets: some may open 2@S as West|pg||
nt|psyck: yes 3rd seat & @h suit are generally more suitable to a preemtive bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: but if Fleisher is balanced selling out  looks better - maybe even x'd|pg||
nt|psyck: W hand was yucky for any choice of bids|pg||
nt|ritong: with their microNT, they need a good scrambling system|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzfv: "Spades were so good, I'll try it again"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C on 42 with diamond lead in open room|pg||
nt|barnets: had North opened 4@H East probably would bid 4N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: prudent fold by tor|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@HX down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: gold medal to passing 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: zia showed '5' hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: was willing to play 43 if it came to that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "i know you like a good challenge, zia"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4-4 spade fit was not considered, so martel did not have the clue available here|pg||
nt|rimbus: Anyway, Duboin chosed a spade lead : who is right ?|pg||
nt|ritong: the scoreboard is|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|phil: not a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: what was 3@D from the other table?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|phil: important to unblock a club honor perhaps|pg||
nt|phil: big danger of a losing spade getting ditched on the @dK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: no gold medal today|pg||
nt|barnets: whose mistake was this ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 4@S seemed like some sort of shortness bid|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: wonder what line jill levin will choose. |pg||
nt|ritong: @c hook basically ensures it, doesn t it?|pg||
nt|rimbus: 10 of clubs from hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|grebrof: @c 6 from Helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: surely Helness will take the blame, whoever made the mistake|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|3for3: perfectly legal for zia to do what he did.  his partner will play him for 5 hearts, and raise to 4 with 3 card support.|pg||
nt|ritong: guess he would raise that pot under different circumstances|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|phil: can Kamil block the club suit by playing the Q??|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H should convince helness to throw a @S |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|phil: which prevents the entry|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: now he just draws trumps and plays a club|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|phil: Kamil cannot lead clubs however|pg||
nt|phil: well I guess he can cash spades|pg||
nt|phil: and then a club over for Fleisher to cash |pg||
nt|xenya: that @D was wrong -- on this layout|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher is marked with the @sK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzfv: jill levin thinking hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i think all the players from wagar finals are often on bbo. team captain for westheimer, vdoubleu, is familiar to many bboers, especially the juniors. she's involved in organizing ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: special programs for kids|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: sorry i can't give technical analyses. maybe an expert will like to be commentator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers is very well accessorized. i think she has 3 necklaces on. very cool looking. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: TD ken van cleef just walked in. not sure what he wants. think he's just observing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh he came to drink some water :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I met a bunch of bboers at this national. one gave us a very good idea for vugraph - audience participation. how cool would that be?|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that americans can raise on three cards has importance, too|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: actually S can even play a @D now|pg||

nt|bobholl: @C K|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia said he was playing helgemo for the k|pg||
nt|barnets: yes that always seems to happen|pg||
nt|psyck: that was the problem with passing W hand, should have opened & got it off his chest|pg||
mb|1D|nt|phil: Fleisher putting together a nice surge this quarter - they'd be perfect except for that 5@d earlier|pg||
nt|xenya: that was a hair raising experience|pg||
nt|barnets: I agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: also depends if they open 1@C with 5-5 blacks or 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: how often have we held a good hand, only to have partner preempt. then we dont know what to bid cos only singleton in p's suit|pg||
nt|phil: no dull hands here :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: looks like correct bid is pass :)|pg||

nt|ritong: not that it is a great spot, but difficult to avoid it|pg||
nt|rimbus: or no trump ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|3for3: another challenge, to bid slam after opponents opening|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@d from Willenken is oldfashioned?|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman not in on the joke and bids 5@c|pg||
nt|xenya: and NS seem to be contributing a lot too|pg||
nt|psyck: 65 is probably a 1@s opening even for those opening 1@c with 55 like NS do|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|grebrof: its not that a preempt like that has to be leaddirecting|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: sorry our internet died and the access code didn't work. we lost 59 and losing 60 since i just returned.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt by val?|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards over really quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: n/s seem to always ask for it|pg||
nt|rimbus: in NT you cannot try a double finesse in @d, missing the 7 !|pg||
nt|ritong: now zim might dislike @h KJx|pg||
nt|rimbus: Sorry you HAVE 12 tricks with only THREE @d|pg||
nt|ritong: when pard denied @h control|pg||
nt|ritong: but he is basically facing 5+@cs|pg||
nt|ritong: pard raised @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: and why would he lose 2@hs directly?|pg||
nt|rimbus: The raise of @d is exactly what must warn you...|pg||
nt|rimbus: It means : at best will need a finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in the tank|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: my reg pard has KQx to raise:)|pg||
nt|rimbus: yes, but you ask for keys, dont you ?|pg||

pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfv: the ecats site notes 10-13 unvul|pg||
nt|phil: looks like a push|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *nonvul|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|phil: ah ha thanks|pg||
nt|ritong: north it will be, then|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfv: I played live bridge for the 2nd time ever yesterday. overbid like crazy. it was fun :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i'll go and het coffee|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this treatment or similar is called Cole convention, part of Washington Standard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: described in Bridge World many years ago by Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|ritong: ominous|pg||
nt|ritong: is there really anything else than 3NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher scratching his head...|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he cannot "transfer" NTs to his pard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south has shown a hand not worth a reverse with 5+ diamonds and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps fleisher worried about club stoppers, he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s would certainly show an other handtype|pg||
nt|ritong: although we can t be certain about their system inferences, but..|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for their cc and is studying their carding |pg||
nt|phil: if they do play weak NT's, isn't 2@s plenty? |pg||
nt|barnets: Open room miles behind only on board 9 !|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: bon|pg||
pc|s6|nt|grebrof: and ok result for HH here too|pg||
nt|xenya: this makes|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he's a touch too strong...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@S was alerted, but kamil didn't care for an explanation|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: Cayne appeared to take 2@c as promising @s tolerance, it is not clear to me that it should|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is the meaning of spade jack|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|3for3: AND a big result here too|pg||
nt|kit: The good news for Fleisher here is that both pairs have a disaster on the same board|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, agree|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, that tends to compress the imps lost|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|vugraphzfv: willard let down the partition now. she's whispering to valerie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but unfortunately i can't hear them|pg||
nt|3for3: the bad news is they will still be down more than 50|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|medwards: this hand should be a push i would think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: multon would lead the third best with six cards|pg||
nt|ritong: thus, @c3 cannot be more than 5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for diamond but patapon played heart. and so did disa. so they then redid it|pg||
nt|phil: in old KS, an early weak NT system, 3@s showed a powerhouse|pg||
pc|hT|nt|medwards: mildred is a very nice lady. she many good stories from the old days|pg||
nt|barnets: Tiger just holed a 50 ft put !|pg||
nt|psyck: these players a bit faster than Fantoni etc in other room|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we'll make sure to ask her about the good ole days then :)|pg||
nt|medwards: ask hr about first acbl conv cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this looks good for EW, no? i can see a small gain?|pg||
nt|barnets: but hes just 5 under|pg||
nt|barnets: now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|grebrof: bidding a stretchy 3nt nonvul is more or less what they have so far|pg||
nt|3for3: he hasnt made this yet.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|phil: but their 1m openings were fairly beefy too|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|barnets: anyway board 10 coming in open when they played 1@SX here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: diamond discard?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: nah after patapon won the CA. next trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suppose it is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: diamond from dummy :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzfv: quite a few zzz kibitzers kibbing this table. zzz used to be those who logged in anonymously to kib|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but nowadays its likely to be bboers kibbing via their mobile apps. smartphones, tablets :)|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, now he is home|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: rosenberg has shown the @h singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: @sJ, then trump echo, showing ability to ruff|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: the heart queen play may pay dividends |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c5|nt|psyck: this table may finish before they finish that board|pg||
nt|barnets: Monaco only 11 down |pg||
pc|d6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: well...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: we do not have 13 solutions up to that point, do we?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe it confused zimmerman also|pg||
nt|ritong: not good for multon's stomach ulcer, this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher threw a card in anger, so that may have hinted at zimmermann that it was down|pg||
nt|ritong: confused or not, dummy is high|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: well, fNT is not part of basic western european bridge culture|pg||

nt|barnets: then play south for kx diamond i think|pg||
mb|2C|nt|barnets: as north has more spaces in hand|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h can be beated by @d ruff -if played /east|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: Kxx or KTx same probability as Kx or KT|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|barnets: mybe not when south has 4 clubs though|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|psyck: so when Cayne plays low @d 1st, he should switch to trying on of the initial two layouts & fail|pg||
nt|barnets: he is trying to work out if north now has 10 x diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: or 10xx|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfu: 2@C was hearts, 9+|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: he misguessed in 2 card engame|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|barnets: sorry he played for 10 x in north|pg||
nt|psyck: yes mostly a guess i suppose, not much to read on that layout|pg||
nt|barnets: and tried to pin the 10|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: thats what he did|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: big swing hand|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe he though N would false card if he had @d7|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he did|pg||
nt|barnets: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|psyck: operator played @d3 1st round...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|runnerup:  this was let make so can be even an double swing here|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d8|pg||

nt|fabsayc: smooth duck by val would have made hand impossible to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she said "diamond" (so must be small diamond from the 2 in dummy). but then she claimed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when diamond to queen|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they had one board unlucky like this at two different boards, they would be down more, so lucky deal still this|pg||
nt|barnets: which is ok as they have been a bit rocky here you would agree|pg||
nt|rimbus: semi forcing neither|pg||
nt|ritong: when, in states, it is the contrary|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I am off, thx to all spex, and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree about the trump echo, not sure spade jack said anything though|pg||
mb|1D|nt|phil: 4@s does not look cold|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|an|5!H|nt|vugraphzfv: if you have a smartphone or tablet, you can get the bbo app free from the appstores|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: other room passed this one out?|pg||
nt|ritong: both work well, of course|pg||
nt|ritong: matter of philosophy|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil: Roland tells me a @h lead gave away the contract in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: 35-17 Fleisher this segment -- the gap has narrowed down a little but is still quite big|pg||
nt|phil: Axx + Axx does not want to declarer the NT|pg||
nt|psyck: other room chose to bid 2@s instead of x as we suggested|pg||
nt|rimbus: 4@s must go down, but...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|osvaill83: and theres more to come :)|pg||
nt|phil: but if they play 2@s promises 6 - there's little option|pg||
mb|3S|nt|medwards: must not play 3rd seet forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria made perhaps a more sensible bid than Cayne bidding 2@S over 1@S on 10|pg||
nt|rimbus: let's see|pg||
mb|4H|nt|phil: 3N by North looks pretty good to me|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck: it was Nunes who bid 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Versace Lauria sitting EW in open|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry I meant Nunes of course as north|pg||
nt|psyck: Nunes follows with 3@s over Fantoni's 3@c|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ritong: according to 1930's authors, noone has an opening here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: laughter at the 6@D jump|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: actually culbertson would open south hand|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Vugraphzfv: even after the double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nm|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious pass and pull|pg||
nt|rimbus: probably a good strategy, overall, to overcall|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: When South shows up with stiff heart, declarer won't misguess the diamonds|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has to have a stiff|pg||
nt|grebrof: or void|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but declarer won't be playing North for AJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil can likely count on 6-4 on left - with a 5-5, he'd Michaels (or whatever they play to show H + C)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "No double?" -Helness|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I think you are right|pg||
nt|grebrof: just saying|pg||
nt|ritong: also, fantunes play 1X openings differently|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and maybe fulvio did not feel like opening south 1Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rimbus: level of five belongs to opponents, they say|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: ok now to make it |pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemo has to keep @D5|pg||
nt|barnets: just needs a fin i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|medwards: heart lead would cause problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: there's a stopclock in the room counting down available time. only 17 min left to play|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|phil: I don't think 3@h was getting hurt too badly|pg||
nt|psyck: yes this will not trouble him|pg||
nt|barnets: so finally a made slam|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: or 2@s|pg||
nt|barnets: well done e/w|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|ritong: was the right move, though|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i saw at least 6 boards in this set where the trailing side could generate reasonable large swings|pg||
pc|hK|nt|phil: that double gave away some gratuitous information|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards so quickly, sometimes i can't catch his spots|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down now|pg||
nt|phil: when dummy gets tapped he cannot avoid a loss of four tricks that I can see|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told that a ruling is possible on board 18 -- seems there was a wrong explanation by H-H in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: deciding between club and diamond|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfv: but only this + 1 other board so they should be fine.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: and yep this board likely to increase westheimer's lead i think :)|pg||
nt|phil: I think he can lead his shoe and its down|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: might as well strip the clubs and see if there is anything to be learned|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil: Zimmerman conducting a pass and pull sequence? I play 3@d as GF - wonder if they do too?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i have often felt like i fell into one at the slower vugraph tables...|pg||
