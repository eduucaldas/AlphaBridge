nt|Walddk2: Squeeze maybe|pg||
nt|runnerup:  opencatds -maybe east has 10 red cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: 2@h dbl might have been af fine contract for NS|pg||
nt|athene: you can make 6nt if you read the cards|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: lead a small diamond to the jack then east gets in trouble in the ending in the red suits|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|smoller:  I bet he makes it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks normal to lead a diamond up|pg||
nt|athene: if you play to strip-squeeze east you might need to guess his distribution; west needs to keep his @H3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: a coke or a beer?|pg||
nt|athene: then declarer might play east for 6@H 4@D rather than 5-5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|athene: but declarer will have major tenace in both red suits so it should not matter actually|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
mc|12|nt|runnerup:  surrenderer|pg||
nt|athene: even at the end if he is not sure whether east came down to @DKx @HJx or bared one red honour|pg||
nt|athene: he can just cash one red ace|pg||
nt|athene: and if that card does not fall, throw east in|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6nt making is 15+  my guess|pg||
nt|smoller:  a little less maybe, but NS needed the points after hand 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, this is not the mixed pairs, although we have women at this table now|pg||
