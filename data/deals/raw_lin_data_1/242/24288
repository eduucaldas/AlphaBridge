mb|2C|nt|barnets: Peter Fredin like Zia sometimes makes extraordinary bids or plays|pg||
mb|2S|nt|szalay: but very lucky 3N makes as well, thx to 6-3 split AND wellplaced A of @h|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thet will i assume|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H not 3nt|pg||

pc|s4|nt|april7: probably its a Stayman modification to find a possible 5-3 fit in a major|pg||
pc|h6|nt|grebrof: I think it is only 11 tricks|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, east has to hold both @cs and @s|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@D a better contract than 3nt.  it can make even without @D's breaking 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: now at least he thinks he has play|pg||
pc|d6|nt|warrens:  also, won't go down as many when you do go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nystrom says "yuck" as he puts down dummy|pg||

nt|grebrof: someone told me they made 12 at the other table too, so maybe its still a draw :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yes - at least that is what they said - Rosenberg must have pitched a club; play went very fast in the middle|pg||
nt|barnets: so match is now tied|pg||
nt|april7: good defence denying the overtrick|pg||
nt|szalay: partscore is coming|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|warrens:  East is squeezed if he didn't cash the club K first|pg||
nt|grebrof: when S had bid @cs, maybe he just gave up|pg||
nt|grebrof: dont think the @c K mattered|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, we'll assume declarer cashed all his trumps, leaving dummy with @S 10 and Qx of @C|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very sharp 3nt has chances|pg||
nt|april7: could end in a 1NT byS|pg||
nt|april7: E will bid 1H |pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzff: Willenken alerts 2@C and was writing; then realized it was not an alert|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'd rather be in 5@C, since either they don't get trumps started OR I ruff out Kxx of @H's|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @H or @D lead 3nt most likely doomed and a black lead almost sure makes|pg||
nt|april7: might bid 1@H:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: ttrump start does not work for def|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  rather than 3NT.  but 3NT is cold on 4-3 @D's|pg||
nt|barnets: as east has only 1  trump|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is always cold warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  on a trump lead?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  if trump are 2-2?|pg||
nt|barnets: they are not|pg||
nt|barnets: her|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: S did pass (i would X)|pg||
nt|szalay: likely @H lead after given bidding|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: I kinda like bidding with Ss hand - double is weired for me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink asking about minor suit distributions that would open 1@D|pg||
nt|april7: so its not S who plays 1NT but E, since N showed majors E decided for 1NT,a good decision|pg||
nt|szalay: will they find @C shift by SOUTH?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then it is too late|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to get their 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|warrens:  on this hand, 5@C is cold, but in theory it's a cold choice between 3NT and 5@C|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|warrens:  close choise|pg||
nt|warrens:  close choice*|pg||
nt|april7: the very bad @D distribution will lead to the downfall of this contract,making only 1@D,1@C,2@H and 2@S tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink hasn't turned over his K@H yet.  Lots of thinking going on.|pg||
nt|april7: with a play to the 10 of @S from dummy, E might even make 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how many would play here X as responsive as NS?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|warrens:  this makes 4@H's if you can guess the @H's, but not easy after W's opening bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe dbl is both majors or @d and a major then|pg||
nt|grebrof: you risk P bidding @s|pg||
nt|barnets: you see north bid 2N in open|pg||
nt|april7: except S finds the @C switch |pg||
nt|april7: wll Levin find now the winning path?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|warrens:  the 4-1 @D break makes this even more difficult|pg||
pc|s2|nt|grebrof: E must have something for his bid, but it can just as likely be and H in @s|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty W|pg||
nt|april7: now @C switch is easy to find,what else|pg||
pc|c5|nt|grebrof: I dont think they underbid in any case|pg||
nt|barnets: while QX is a great holding when partner has Jxx or the K or A it is not so good here|pg||
nt|barnets: Perhaps north could have tried 2@D instead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: in usa the major part of the top would see X as S here as d bid a suit|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Levin to Brink: you had 5 Clubs?  Brink: yeah|pg||

nt|jaapfr: link to running score??|pg||

nt|jaapfr: thought 12-14|pg||
mb|2H|nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    2@C  for majors    n/s may pinch this in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi Peter|pg||
nt|barnets: another close slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but me a lousy memory|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe variable then?|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H might be reached and made, while 3NT is doomed on a @D lead ofcourse|pg||
nt|bigtrain: operator noted 14-16 on 1st board though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Definitely variable NT, didn't hear the range though.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|clinch: Evening David :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: pass|pg||
nt|barnets: which has no play on a @D lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|warrens:  this is slam on a lead.  I don't usually think depending on the wrong lead is a good idea, but I have seen some exceptions :)|pg||
nt|barnets: you see norths imaginative 3! D bid|pg||
nt|barnets: which would not occur to most of us|pg||
nt|warrens:  Fredin likes to bid, as we see here.  with 4 small @H's, he's assuming his partner has a fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no links available?|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: yes a spec says hes bidding for the lead|pg||

nt|clinch: Will do well to get out for -1 in 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: likely to get club wrong|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes N has implied short clubs|pg||
nt|ady: think 2NT was just competitive   but west decided 3@C better spot|pg||
nt|clinch: Declarer knows S short in @h, so may play top @cs|pg||
nt|clinch: to avoid ruff|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S was very likely to make  so will need to restrict to 1 down for a push|pg||
nt|clinch: but then there's the matter of the third @s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyone understands X on 5@C in OR?|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be a fast 420, just 3 IMPs loss|pg||
pc|h5|nt|warrens:  Martel might pull to show interest in slam|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, he did.  he wants Zia to bid 6 with short @D's for sure|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|barnets: so e/w exchange 1100 for 650|pg||
nt|dinos1: but would Zia bid 4@h with stiff @d and @cAK?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: In the other room, Ralph Katz opened 1@D in 3rd seat, Dan Zagorin overcalled 1NT and they reached 3NT.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|barnets: 2@S is a fit jump spades and hearts |pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, clear road|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 1 and void|pg||
nt|barnets: some play that as 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: not important 4 card @h..but he has bad opener suit|pg||
nt|barnets: if the void was clubs 7@H may work|pg||
nt|phil: isn't 5N generally an even number and an unknown void? |pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  interesting question whether this is RKC for @H's or @s's|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk unknown void|pg||
nt|tez: 5 NT 1/3 KC And void|pg||
nt|barnets: it is clearly hearts Warren|pg||
nt|phil: sounds like he thought it was spades - or maybe 6-ace|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3 by PH is impossible :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@S agrees hearts|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think it should be @H's, but don't most people play 5NT shows 2 KC's + void?|pg||

nt|dinos1: by UPH mb|pg||
nt|tez: ýf @c void easy 7|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps Zia misbid or they play other responses|pg||
nt|phil: depends on partner's spades....|pg||

nt|tez: Martel sure pd has not @s void:)|pg||

nt|clinch: Unfortunately don't know what the EW bidding shows or asks here.... 2@c obviously asking, but not clear after that|pg||
nt|ady: some would bid 2NT with east hand first re-bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Thank goodness for Al Hollander! 2@c= puppet to 2@d, 2@d denied some specific hands, 2NT confirmed 2@c natural and forcing|pg||

nt|dinos1: A, then @s after fat @s signal|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: at least 1 more|pg||

nt|phil: Monaco is in to the round of 8 - Berg WD's after 3|pg||
nt|tez: neck and neck last round|pg||
nt|odysseus70: hard for declarer to believe East had so much|pg||
nt|jaapfr: new leader|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: last hand of the session|pg||
nt|tez: we are here|pg||
nt|reisig: 3N is normal ..just doesn't make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Chris: good match|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|ady: thx Peter Don and sspecks|pg||
nt|barnets: close 3n|pg||
nt|odysseus70: last board of a close encounter-|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2:  Here you can't make 4@S legitimately, but it's a tough defence|pg||
nt|phil: big board for Zia / Chip here|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1 partscore and the other 15 are games bid - not all made - thats teams all right|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have 4 losers in hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|clinch: Match nicely evened up again thanks to the imaginative lead on 31 in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  do well in diamonds   10 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: but easy to see how the defense can stub its toe - it almost happened in the OR|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last board of a very fine session|pg||
mb|2D|an|Xfer, 5+ !H|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S shows spades and diamonds I am informed|pg||
nt|ady: yet west supports spades   maybe thinks AX enough|pg||
nt|tez: 3@c asking 5 card major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and tx Chase for your very fine job|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and szalay and avril for your commentating|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Thank you.  The 2nd quarter will be up very shortly after this board, please come back!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|odysseus70: this time game is very good and they should get there|pg||
mb|3C|nt|grebrof: dbl +4 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H too high    but will east defend|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|phil: not 4-5 spades? |pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl 3@s|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, 4-5|pg||
nt|phil: yeah|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You need a diamond ruff as your 10th trick, so you must hope to sneak a trump through West|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h is contract also in open room|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and lbnl tx all for your fine tips ideas info and help kibs|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all|pg||
mb|4H|nt|clinch: Also by N|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  well down if defence taps declarer|pg||
nt|phil: 3@d simply denies one - it DOES NOT promise a four card major like regular puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Which Martel did in the open room|pg||
nt|reisig: OOOPS|pg||
nt|tez: equal..1 down|pg||
nt|phil: wow - big tempo lost here|pg||
nt|barnets: must shift heart now|pg||
nt|dinos1: lost tempo to set @d's|pg||
nt|barnets: or it makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: you can reverse the dummy somewhat but the wrong hand has the 4th club|pg||
nt|ady: 14 imps to Fleisher on 31   made 3NT   when down 3 here|pg||
nt|clinch: Will need to find @s switch sometime here...will test EW signalling|pg||
nt|ady: great recovery by Fleisher   in the lead  and may gain on this hand|pg||
nt|clinch: Though as Victor Silverstone points out, the 3@s bid makes it easier :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not tough to make this 4@H imo|pg||
pc|sK|nt|reisig: shift to left foot ...still makes|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h shift wont help|pg||
nt|barnets: why ?|pg||
nt|phil: and duck a heart as well - the level of difficulty just went up a few notches|pg||
nt|dinos1: coz u cant open this suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: always make 4@S as EW?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|grebrof: now one match is live at http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|barnets: well I play a heart and duck it|pg||
nt|phil: yeah but two heart tricks does him no good|pg||
nt|reisig: @d was good ..just ONE trick late :)|pg||
nt|barnets: and try and make 2 hearts and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|phil: two heart tricks....for declarer (to specs)|pg||
nt|barnets: does that work ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am not so sure but anyway a good safe\|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: East cant see the the long clubs  as we can|pg||
nt|jaapfr: V-NV:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|jaapfr: what a sneaky way to make 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|phil: the theme is "play the suit you do not want the opponents playing"|pg||
nt|odysseus70: very solid finish on last 3 boards makes it difficult to see how Rosenthal can win|pg||
pc|cT|nt|phil: maybe Zia is rubbing off on him :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: not @c?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: 8@D  told the story|pg||
pc|h2|nt|barnets: new leader now|pg||
nt|barnets: tx all specs must go now|pg||
nt|reisig: Thx Barnet!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|phil: the spade at T2 is so sexy....|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Spade and a test for Willenken|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: y but must find @C 3-3 AND @SQ!!|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|clinch: Switch not found in open room|pg||
nt|ady: another swing?|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|odysseus70: problems about how to play this- worries abot 4-1 hearts and d ruffs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus70: lack of entries suggests that right play was ace and another heart-however no way to go down as cards lie|pg||
nt|odysseus70: this extra entry gives options with hearts -can play queen to guard against K10xx with South -losing to bare king with North-that looks right|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: does not work|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|nt|jaapfr: is in fact @SJ even sneakier (in stead of the 9)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ?|pg||
nt|tez: well played.i cant say any for defence:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2:  Now it's becoming too obvious I think|pg||
nt|ady: already 25 imps recently   so will be over 30|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|odysseus70: thx all|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaapfr: we all(most) agree 4@S likely down|pg||
