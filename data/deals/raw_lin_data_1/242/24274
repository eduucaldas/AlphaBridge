nt|3for3: of course the jack of hearts is a good card too|pg||

nt|joest:  4NT is the most negative bid you could make here and I think the hand is somewhat better than that|pg||
nt|joest:  but west is so strong that I suspect she will shrug her shoulders and just bid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6nt also on cards -but 6 @d has better chance just in case @d 4(s) -1 |pg||
nt|joest:  how do you get dummy's club away if diamonds are 4-1?|pg||
nt|joest:  i suppose there are some very small squeeze possibilities in 6NT that don't exist in 6@d|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some endplay chances in 6 @D to ruff and shorten your trump|pg||

nt|3for3: oh, she can start from dummy sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Meyers bidding box is messed up and she can't find the 3@h card - |pg||
nt|kit: maybe that should give her a hint that she is supposed to bid more than 3@H :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Mildred gave Meyers her bidding box so she had the 3@d and 3@h cards - director is now looking for them|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|3for3: The fear of the solid club suit was probably what kept north in 3NT|pg||
nt|3for3: In other room|pg||
nt|kit: Did this happen?|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@H a transfer?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: if so, a huge accident|pg||
nt|3for3: I warned convolution was on the horizon, but didnt expect this :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Molson alerted 3@h and now meyers is studying the tray with her head in her hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: Meyers to Mildred: "I have no idea what this is, I think she thought I was transferring|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfv: Molson: "all right, well that's close to 5-5 with a stiff club" Meyers: "2@c is a 1-suiter, we play Cappelletti"|pg||
nt|kit: N-S were about to pick up at least a part-score swing, maybe a game swing, and now are in a silly contract.  Shows the importance of having firm rules which cover all situations so ...|pg||
nt|kit: a mixup like this doesn't happen.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: Actually, declarer may come close to making this wretched contract|pg||
nt|kit: 2 diamond and 2 club winners, so need to scramble 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: The director has returned with a full set of bidding cards for Mildred, so both she and Meyers can now bid 3 of a red suit on the next hand :)|pg||
nt|kit: I actually think it will make unless West finds a difficult trump shift|pg||
nt|3for3: This is the first time out in a national event for NS, a new partnership|pg||
nt|kit: And of course West has no club what South's hand is on this kind of auction.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|joest:  north-south have a heart game here (luckily) that will be hard to bid|pg||
mb|2H|an|8-11 inv|nt|joest:  2@h clearly a weak jump shift in competition|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  btw, sometimes I see people make a negative double with hands like north's|pg||
nt|joest:  to try to bring spades into focus|pg||
nt|joest:  with a seven card suit, put your faith there,|pg||
nt|joest:  in spades, one tap of the north hand and it is out of commission|pg||
mb|3N|nt|joest:  imho :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  do you move now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  it seems auto to run but Disa understandably concerned her partner might have just running clubs|pg||
