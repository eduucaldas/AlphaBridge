mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to bid much higher|pg||
mb|3H|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H not at all forward going|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||
nt|phil: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|phil: same lead in OR|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't expect 2@s from S|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: that seems to have helped EW find the game|pg||
nt|barnets: and 4@H is a good contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfv: all the way up?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: this will take a lot of good guessing to make|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|phil: Rosenberg ducked, diamond returned...not that anything really matters on this layout|pg||
nt|barnets: making most of the time when opener has @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: East really had a 3@H bid countng @SK as a trick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|barnets: in fact in other room east cued an raised to 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling and bidding over a minimum response already showed a big hand...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|mc|10|nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfu: looks like the notes (and conversations) will be in Italian, so I'll be little help in giving info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  lets you spy on other room  and access voice commentary without login|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Was 2@c game forcing? |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: Seems so|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = ART, FG, 4+@C or @D fit|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: levin says "we should just play open notes"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hello. only score is accurate cos we started late|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: players cracking jokes about their no trump overcalls|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria cued and bid 3@H closer to the valuation I think|pg||
mb|1D|nt|phil: so what to open on an 8-4 :)? |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: you don't see these hands in textbooks|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: so 4@H in open also|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil: Zimmerman had to be tempted to bid 6@d here|pg||
nt|phil: it cant be that expensive, and who knows who makes what? |pg||
nt|phil: yet, partner's 5@d made them guess|pg||
nt|phil: maybe East should x 5@h?  he has some surprise defense|pg||
nt|phil: although I'm not really clear what a w/w 5m opening is supposed to show|pg||
nt|phil: but definitely not KQTx in a side major :)|pg||
nt|phil: NS appear to have four losers, but it seems like they would have a hard time taking all four|pg||
nt|phil: give east Axxx of clubs, and 6@d actually makes - but so does 6M (probably)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: do we know what fleischer's double shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
nt|phil: this will compress one of the losers|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I don't think W can try 3N, will likely bid on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: at that point, nothing makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: he does not know partner has just 1 club|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to stop in a @d partial after 2@c anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I think Martel will just come back a spade -- bigger danger declarer has ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just penalty worth hand|pg||
nt|ritong: your lead, michael|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fell asleep|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: must've not caught the 1@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: and is hoping clubs run|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: zimmerman double was either brave or foolhardy|pg||
nt|ritong: a small swing to fleisher, presumably|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: south might pass other room, 1NT west swish  @s lead 90|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|kit: wrong again|pg||
nt|phil: so an undoubled vulnerable save against a making 5@d'|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|3for3: even playing 0/2 leads, wouldn't know if his honor was Q or K|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: Anyway, this speeds things up.|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||

nt|xenya: i'm really surprised W didn't bid 6@D|pg||
nt|phil: my daughter was getting her wisdom teeth out during the 1Q - looks like I missed some interesting boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: very interesting boards on the 1Q|pg||

nt|phil: oh|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, 6@d is definitely possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: against a very weak nt, after norths double transfer bids by south give more options|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: laughter about how they have special double cards for penalty and marked ones for takeout|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|3for3: ew might sniff around at slam here|pg||
nt|phil: I like 1@d. I loathe 2N|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he was afraid of pushing NS to a makeable slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi again|pg||
nt|psyck: NS CC: http://usbf.org/images/conventioncards/cayne-seamon.jpg|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: as I said before you arrived - Multon's 5@d have his opps a tough guess - and they might have guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|phil: *gave|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kit: They have a lot of high cards for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *just -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if Kamil bid 5@d (and why shouldn't he?) the spades would have been buried|pg||
nt|phil: now Zimmerman can pattern out|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: they like their 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will keep them out of any slam|pg||
mb|3C|nt|3for3: true, but from helgemo's POV cant east hace a stiff club?|pg||
nt|barnets: this a better 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he though partner had heart support I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 5@H was a bold bid, in the jaws of unfavourable vulnurability |pg||
nt|phil: yeah - along with some nice defense too|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: solo|pg||
nt|xenya: all in all well done by both sides on the last hand|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|phil: 4@h does not handle well|pg||
nt|phil: he's tapped down to parity at T1|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike 4@S?|pg||
nt|phil: if hearts break OK, he can manage 4H + 5S + 1C and doesn't need the club hook|pg||
nt|phil: in spades can't you take 5S in hand, 3 ruffs in dummy plus two aces? |pg||
nt|xenya: unless they lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: in the other room, N didn't get in -- still, S found a @C lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: he can, but even then there might not be 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|phil: yes that may cause difficulties - but maybe declarer can make something out of the heart suit then|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|3for3: q of clubs was the q of hearts, and slam is laydown|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "We have some bad news" - Cayne|pg||
mb|4D|an|rkc !C|nt|barnets: 6@C poor contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|an|3 kc|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|kit: I don't really see What Helgemo can bid but 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are in sync with open room, almost equivalent auctions|pg||
mb|5C|an|1 kc|nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Maybe 5@S, focusing attention on club control at the slight risk of going down there.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|psyck: but the finesses are in :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: so there may be some counters - hard to say who comes out on top|pg||
nt|phil: but overall 4@s looks worlds better than 4@h|pg||
nt|phil: ruffing looks a little better here - the diamond suit is tied up if he does|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: in reality, zia passed the 12 count as east, south opened 1NT, was left there and apprently made 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they |pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart lead needs a red king guess and club guess|pg||
nt|psyck: likely down as may not take @c fin|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzfv: 1 less finesse needed|pg||
nt|barnets: the percentage in clubs is from the top|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: in any case, i wholly agree with what you said about the 2N bid, Phil -- E's hand just doesn't qualify|pg||
pc|hK|nt|phil: but if he draws the last trump, what does he pitch from dummy? |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: excellent, then went up from 25 % to 50 % :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: maybe cayne had not his morning coffee yet|pg||
mb|2D|an|4+!D, limit+|nt|vugraphzfv: no superfluous conversation in this room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all very focused|pg||
nt|phil: in the other room in 4@s, declarer started to finesse in clubs, and then chickened out - South ruffed, returned a trump, and that was that|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@S in the other room, Rosenberg opted for a very unfortunate line|pg||
nt|phil: but he will be pleased to learn he won 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|osvaill83: undo|pg||
nt|3for3: missing a pass|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry Phil :)|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: 3N is excellent NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many possible bids by south|pg||
mb|3D|an|unbalanced, minimum|nt|kit: I agree -- that's why I think he has to just bid 4@S and hope that if East has a stiff club he can make a move.|pg||
nt|phil: but 3@h is in 800 country|pg||
nt|xenya: yeah|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: both 3NT and 5@d make here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C by helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: they should have learnt from deal 2 not to trust their 7 card suits headed by AK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "I'm the one making all of the mistakes" - Helness|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: wow Multon doesn't even consider 4@c|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT having the advantage to score 630 if they do not cash @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wow, this works but is risking missing a game|pg||
nt|psyck: My pd's rarely say that to me|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzfv: hmm not sure if 2h or 2c should be alerted as garbage stayman. just happy i made out what she wrote.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that Kx looks very bad for slam|pg||
nt|barnets: first blood to Cayne 2 imps with 5@D down1 against 3n here down2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Can't believe you didn't even try 3N w/ that hand" - Seamon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jokes all across the table|pg||
nt|psyck: ruffing a couple of @c's would work here, not clear what is best|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: N is not concerned about hearts here, rather about the quality of the 1D suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: just a spade doubleton and some aces|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some confusion over the x? |pg||
nt|phil: double these days generally means anything but penalty|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s= " i need help in that suit buddy"|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria- versace did well to stop in 4N on last board|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|3for3: a variation of 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|barnets: going beyond 3N looking for slam |pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny says "i dont have much help" as she laid downdumy|pg||
nt|psyck: @s shift could have fetched 1@s, 3@d, 1@c to def, but now declarer has a chance again|pg||
nt|barnets: he is not cold in even  4N though as misguessed the clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: he still has to guess @h fin to get rid of @s loser|pg||
nt|barnets: and needs heart fin to make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: 4@c= "get lost"|pg||
nt|ritong: or something like that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a "buddy" bid|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but molson says "you have trumps!"|pg||
nt|phil: well thats sad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: double was a @H stopper ask|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: Declarer has problems here.  Even with the clubs coming in, there are only 8 winners.|pg||
nt|phil: and 3N must have meant a partial stopper|pg||
nt|phil: so he wasn't far off|pg||
nt|psyck: @h fin needed this deal & in 4NT other room :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so first big swing for Cayne|pg||
pc|dK|nt|phil: so why 5@d??|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: french word is " coopératif"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or we use to call it a west coast cue bid (asking for half stopper)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|3for3: quite thin game.  needs clubs to behave, 44 diamonds for starters|pg||
nt|3for3: and 9th trick to come from spades.|pg||
nt|grebrof: !k and switch to @ds?|pg||
nt|grebrof: @H K|pg||
nt|kit: If East does shift to king of hearts, declarer will definitely win the trick|pg||
nt|kit: Since he is looking at down 1 if he ducks.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes. but it will make the defense easy|pg||
nt|phil: NS work very hard on ther agreemenets|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|clinch: Those of us who watch Cayne regularly will know that is right at the weakest end of his weak 2s - paid dividends|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe these national championships also give WBF points   i have fuzzy recollection about that|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: garbage stayman|pg||
nt|xenya: prosaic, yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: Zia should stop playing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia: "I knew I could make it, I Just didn't know which chance you gave me"|pg||
nt|phil: but there's always that sequence where there's a little fuzziness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@D was preemptive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not constructive|pg||
nt|phil: they play transfers there kendrick? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in what sequence?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: the 3@S?|pg||
nt|phil: after the overcall - pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not that I know of|pg||
nt|barnets: the specs have a treat today with almost certainly 3 of the world's best teams in the semi-final|pg||
nt|barnets: an unusual occurence|pg||
mb|2D|an|nat|nt|phil: I wonder how they'd show a constructive raise then? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: they possibly could, but I'm unsure|pg||
nt|phil: no worries|pg||
mb|2N|nt|phil: I thought NS played Flannery....I'm confused now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think, multi|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
nt|phil: kind of a wacky multi opener red/white - maybe trying to create a little early action|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: the "lost track" part may occur a lot, unfortunately, as these ladies at times play with supersonic gusto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thinking|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is generally 'transfer me' and 4@d is 'you bid it' - which Kamil will do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it will work out|pg||
nt|phil: looks like he wanted to protect any diamond cards in Marty's hand|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman has the world's fair on this auction|pg||
nt|phil: now - Zimmerman should be less excited about playing hearts now|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d advertises length in both|pg||
nt|xenya: if he bids 4@H, he will make it|pg||
nt|phil: NS can make a lot of sapdes however|pg||
nt|phil: I think they bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: assuming it gets passed out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Zimmermann in the tank. |pg||
nt|phil: 4@h is a little awkward to play - but I think South has the option of losing one of his trump tricks or allowing the diamond pitch to be taken, right? |pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C doesn't look too bad either -- until you see the whole layout|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, hearts that are "Hawaii" (5-0) is very bad for both|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps just an interesting, how do you stop 4@s? |pg||
mb|3H|an|transfer|nt|kit: Interesting -- so Zia didn't work out that West could dodge the end-play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helgemo embarassed he threw his @H away|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|phil: I would take dbl of 4@d as 'cards' and a subsequent x of 4@s as penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now 5NT or 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades are shakey, i think 4 enough|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D seems a tad conservative with that fine 46|pg||
nt|phil: Multon not excited about defending 4@s with his paucity of defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: action!|pg||
nt|phil: aieee|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder Zimmermann was in the tank -- the whole auction looks crazy, from his perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all purpose DSI double (do something intelligent)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H seems right for north on that basis|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: he might be afraid North has just hearts|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: no oops here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the downside of the upgrading craze occurs on hands like this|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: well 3 is down a lot but a deep position|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, imps do not grow on trees|pg||
nt|ritong: down 40 or so|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: with 12 boards to go...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny has to use the restroom. the rest are waiting for her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson left with her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers started reading the newspaper|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: real news, not bridge news. hope she doesn't get distracted by all the crazy stuff happening today :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually i think she's doing the puzzles. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson seems a very friendly chatty person. she's back now.|pg||
nt|kit: now this bid I don't understand -- seems like clear 3NT call by Zia|pg||
nt|xenya: N might pass  now?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|3for3: well, north is a PH, so with just hearts he can just bid them, either a weak 2, or 2@H at second turn|pg||
nt|phil: Lightner from Fleisher now? |pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: granted this is not a normal situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in that case why not 3nt by rosenberg|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|phil: a quick -2|pg||
nt|phil: Kamil will also rip 6@h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: good point Danny -- I forgot about initial pass|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|grebrof: what to bid than 2@d?|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil knows Fleisher is ruffing the heart, so his lead is suit preference|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: So here we have another close 3NT contract|pg||
nt|3for3: entry problems for the 9th trick, even if the clubs are 33.|pg||
nt|phil: don't they lose a diamond too? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ending in 2nt has no upside|pg||
nt|ritong: are you absolutely sure to want to lecture rosenberg about imps tactics?:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: i always bid 6nt if close|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and here danger of a bad spade break makes 6nt my choice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|grebrof: @d to 10?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i do think if your going to swing you need to start early, and 3nt is the best contract for that tactic|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ok|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: they are guessing contract in our room (with no success)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: looks like down 2 from here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: might ruff honor, and finesse the J@S?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: @Cs offer a better chance|pg||
nt|kit: if clubs 3-3, opponents can't cash 4 tricks |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 3 off -- there's a @D to lose as well|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 3 wins, npp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: it was correct|pg||
nt|kit: East didn't squander 8 of clubs on 2nd round of clubs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: S can exit in trumps again when in with @sa, but ewill be endplayed again, but that will still be 8th trick only|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: almost certainly|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: I assume this is operator error with the club spots|pg||
nt|grebrof: for me, the operator is god - I dont know what happened :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, after the 2@C fuss, i might have gotten lost|pg||
nt|pelu:  for sure @c 10 8 left in East|pg||
nt|grebrof: Helness in the tank now?|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: 4 imps fot Cayne when 2@S made 3 down here|pg||
mb|1N|an|alert|nt|fabsayc: 2@S 5 spades and 4 card minor, popular in Europe in conjunction with multi 2@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: certaintly not my idea of a weak two bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzfv: molson jotting down some notes to herself...think she wants to discuss with jill meyers later|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she wrote "when shifting to singleton against preempts..."|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since I can't say anything nice, I won't say anything|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this hand is as close to ideal if your ever going to do it|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will make life easier for declarer, as he will prefer to finesse the clubs rather than try to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|kit: I must admit I don't understand making deceptive leads in the blind like this.  Seems too likely that they will cause partner to misjudge the hand.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 1@H can be bid on 0 points (at least most play that way) so south can not afford to force to game|pg||
nt|ritong: i think like him, nope   because no source of tricks apart trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surprise 7 imps to fleischer when 7D went four down in open room|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfv: up up and away|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers asked jill levin - big hand? <nod>|pg||
nt|3for3: this should be a dull 3nt|pg||
nt|barnets: idec needs say 8 trumps 2@H 2@D makes 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: btw internet connection here is a bit slow.|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think it is a 3 or 4 problem  rather 4 or 6  south does not want to lure his pard into a slam without goodies|pg||
nt|psyck: just 5 levels lower than we hoped for|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i only 2 points and 1 quick tricks short of a roth opener|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: 3N by W is virtually hopeless on likely @H lead -- might be quite different now...|pg||
nt|barnets: seamon has never passed before with those trump spots|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: same|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 2@S is showing some form of @S stopper|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: most of the time 4+@S, any shape|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i missed that|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: 6@C unclear here|pg||
nt|ritong: multon does not double 6@c|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard likely knows about his @s void anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i was lost in another auction, yes 5@S denying queen, so now 6@C has to be offer to play|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, a ruff is not enough to beat a slam|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu:  sure :)|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps zim is trying to get them in 6@s|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling 6@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, his team led comfortably|pg||
nt|ritong: in french we say " tempête sous un crâne"|pg||
nt|barnets: Cayne will not be so pleased when he may make slam|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|3for3: i thought the idea was to try to lead our 5 card suits, not theirs :)|pg||
nt|xenya: note the Q, not a small card -- pinning the 9 |pg||
nt|kit: also giving the opponents headaches|pg||
nt|kit: the 10 of hearts play, that is|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer just trying to set up long heart for tenth trick -- no risk involved|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|henryb:  the duck (quack-quack) doubleton is not an endearing feature|pg||

nt|barnets: some may open 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: Cayne could bid 2@s or something with a 2 loser hand & @s void, & of couse S need not have passed with that hand|pg||
nt|barnets: opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if Fleisher has @d's, great|pg||
nt|barnets: some may open 2@S as West|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: "i know you like a good challenge, zia"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4-4 spade fit was not considered, so martel did not have the clue available here|pg||

nt|grebrof: I dont think it was a jumpfit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now that casual diamond king play not looking so good|pg||
nt|barnets: an contains 2 Italians, one from france and of course 2 from norway|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: is weak 2s with east's hand ever okay? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not a jump fit|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher have had a lot of small swings by simply allowing less undertricks than Zimmerman this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  and the defense didnt take so many :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we'll probably get to interview mildred breed from the other room soon. very nice lady|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzfv: check out bbo news for updates :) yep pelu lol|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfv: 3 boards to go in this set. |pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|kit: West might have bid some clubs there -- would have made things even more exciting|pg||
nt|phil: EW play weak NT's? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: unsure, they were only discussing multi's and their other 2 level openers at the beginning|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it --nonvulnerable perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C forcing?, probably|pg||
nt|ritong: now we are in 3NT, from south or north depending upon kamil's decision to raise fsf|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not without an overbidder's lisence, hard to get in PA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: LOL|pg||
nt|grebrof: not even a fitjump|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|3for3: big result for monaco in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: the ecats site notes 10-13 unvul|pg||
nt|phil: looks like a push|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *nonvul|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|phil: ah ha thanks|pg||
nt|ritong: north it will be, then|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: I played live bridge for the 2nd time ever yesterday. overbid like crazy. it was fun :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i'll go and het coffee|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this treatment or similar is called Cole convention, part of Washington Standard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: described in Bridge World many years ago by Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|ritong: ominous|pg||
nt|ritong: is there really anything else than 3NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher scratching his head...|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he cannot "transfer" NTs to his pard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south has shown a hand not worth a reverse with 5+ diamonds and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps fleisher worried about club stoppers, he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s would certainly show an other handtype|pg||
nt|ritong: although we can t be certain about their system inferences, but..|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for their cc and is studying their carding |pg||
nt|phil: if they do play weak NT's, isn't 2@s plenty? |pg||
nt|barnets: Open room miles behind only on board 9 !|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: bon|pg||
pc|h3|nt|grebrof: and ok result for HH here too|pg||
nt|xenya: this makes|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he's a touch too strong...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@S was alerted, but kamil didn't care for an explanation|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|psyck: Cayne appeared to take 2@c as promising @s tolerance, it is not clear to me that it should|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: what is the meaning of spade jack|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|3for3: AND a big result here too|pg||
nt|kit: The good news for Fleisher here is that both pairs have a disaster on the same board|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, agree|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, that tends to compress the imps lost|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: willard let down the partition now. she's whispering to valerie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but unfortunately i can't hear them|pg||
nt|3for3: the bad news is they will still be down more than 50|pg||
pc|h2|nt|medwards: this hand should be a push i would think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: multon would lead the third best with six cards|pg||
nt|ritong: thus, @c3 cannot be more than 5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for diamond but patapon played heart. and so did disa. so they then redid it|pg||
nt|phil: in old KS, an early weak NT system, 3@s showed a powerhouse|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|medwards: mildred is a very nice lady. she many good stories from the old days|pg||
nt|barnets: Tiger just holed a 50 ft put !|pg||
nt|psyck: these players a bit faster than Fantoni etc in other room|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzfv: we'll make sure to ask her about the good ole days then :)|pg||
nt|medwards: ask hr about first acbl conv cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this looks good for EW, no? i can see a small gain?|pg||
nt|barnets: but hes just 5 under|pg||
nt|barnets: now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|grebrof: bidding a stretchy 3nt nonvul is more or less what they have so far|pg||
nt|3for3: he hasnt made this yet.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|phil: but their 1m openings were fairly beefy too|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i suppose it is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: diamond from dummy :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzfv: quite a few zzz kibitzers kibbing this table. zzz used to be those who logged in anonymously to kib|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but nowadays its likely to be bboers kibbing via their mobile apps. smartphones, tablets :)|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, now he is home|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||

nt|fabsayc: smooth duck by val would have made hand impossible to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she said "diamond" (so must be small diamond from the 2 in dummy). but then she claimed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when diamond to queen|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they had one board unlucky like this at two different boards, they would be down more, so lucky deal still this|pg||
nt|barnets: which is ok as they have been a bit rocky here you would agree|pg||
mb|1C|nt|3for3: I am off, thx to all spex, and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree about the trump echo, not sure spade jack said anything though|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: if you have a smartphone or tablet, you can get the bbo app free from the appstores|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: other room passed this one out?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|phil: Roland tells me a @h lead gave away the contract in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: 35-17 Fleisher this segment -- the gap has narrowed down a little but is still quite big|pg||
nt|phil: Axx + Axx does not want to declarer the NT|pg||
nt|psyck: other room chose to bid 2@s instead of x as we suggested|pg||
mb|3D|nt|osvaill83: and theres more to come :)|pg||
nt|phil: but if they play 2@s promises 6 - there's little option|pg||
mb|3H|nt|medwards: must not play 3rd seet forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria made perhaps a more sensible bid than Cayne bidding 2@S over 1@S on 10|pg||
mb|4D|nt|phil: 3N by North looks pretty good to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: it was Nunes who bid 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Versace Lauria sitting EW in open|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry I meant Nunes of course as north|pg||
nt|psyck: Nunes follows with 3@s over Fantoni's 3@c|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ritong: according to 1930's authors, noone has an opening here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: laughter at the 6@D jump|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: actually culbertson would open south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: even after the double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nm|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious pass and pull|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: When South shows up with stiff heart, declarer won't misguess the diamonds|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has to have a stiff|pg||
nt|grebrof: or void|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but declarer won't be playing North for AJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil can likely count on 6-4 on left - with a 5-5, he'd Michaels (or whatever they play to show H + C)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "No double?" -Helness|pg||
pc|cK|nt|grebrof: I think you are right|pg||
nt|grebrof: just saying|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
