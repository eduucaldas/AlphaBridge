pc|hT|nt|dagold: say he plays on diamonds then he will need a succesful club guess, likely when south shows up with long spades and 3 diamonds|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dagold: easy with trumps 2-2. declarer cant really cater to 3-1 breaks as the heart ruff looms and it would be hard to deal with the 3rd diamond if trumps 3-1|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dagold: 14-16 nt becoming more common as the modern style opens so many 11s. it now means the 1N rebid is not the difficult wide range of 11-14, but the easier to handle 11-13|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: either 4@c or 4@d bid by E would have gotten them to 5@d|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: I dont mind opening 5 but the hand is a bit too suitable for 3N|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|runnerup:  and well stopped here for partial in @s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dagold: but west with 7@h bids them|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|runnerup:  almost 9 in your hand so 3 @d isn't overbid|pg||
nt|dagold: some play 4@h as encouriging and 4@d as a puppet to 4@h to sign off|pg||
nt|runnerup:  -2 in @h game -so east is not happy to see what is happening |pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: 1@S artificial|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: 1@h-1N-2@d-2@h would have been more normal, but N tries a tactical approach|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: looks around 2 down if defence clears hearts early|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if partner has 10 of @s -is it too much to expect -you have normally 9 in your own hand|pg||

nt|oleberg:  NS has been very thorough in discussing scrambling vs Lebensohl|pg||
nt|oleberg:  I don't know all their specific agreements, so I was guessing here. I only know the have agreements in all situations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW are not a familiar partnership -- i wonder if they've discussed what Fu's options were after 3@C|pg||

nt|runnerup:  why not open 1nt if 14-16|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Always contains diamonds, but strebght may vary|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  2@D = Non-exceptional hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Maybe they play 15-17 vulnerable|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe 15-17 in 3rd and 4th?|pg||
nt|dagold: 2@s surprises me|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@S = Doubleton spade and around 10 hcp|pg||
nt|dagold: I would be happy to leave 2@d with that hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup:  3nt in 34 in other table was payed by west and still made because Q92 supricly was a double hold -and declarer took 5 @c tricks|pg||
nt|dagold: no game in their system and I would guess 2@d to be better spot than 2@s on average|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this can be a figth to beat|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2:  yes|pg||

nt|runnerup:  to overtake 1. @h was surely wrong -now it looks hmm making perhaps|pg||
nt|dagold: I don't think the heart ace was best but he was desparate to put the trump through|pg||
nt|dagold: I think the defence still in control |pg||
nt|dagold: but had south stayed on lead, defence could get two rounds of trumps in|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2012/02/spingold/  for halftime scores in the Spingold|pg||
nt|dagold: some specs suggest Ace of spades lead, perhaps but the heart sequence tough to avoid|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if declarer gets 1 ruff 4 @s in hand @c ace and 2 @d he makes -but difficult|pg||
nt|dagold: vital he plays low here to even stand a chance, the J or K will probably lead to down two|pg||

nt|barnets: as it was|pg||
nt|dagold: so he was hoping for some help in clubs in dummy or wrong lead or simply that 3N was a save on a good day|pg||

nt|dagold: prefer 1N as F or say 3@c as inv|pg||
nt|barnets: 3n not such a bad contract either|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and like it is 1nt bid and some ..maybe 3 overtricks coming|pg||
nt|dagold: dont see how an NF 1N on that is a playable method|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s lead against 4 @s and that is over -3nt? -entryproblems there -so not easy|pg||
nt|dagold: lose 2@h, 3@s and 1@c I think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dagold: so I really can't see how 2@s doubled would have made|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe, but those secondary diamonds in North are not so easy to show|pg||
nt|barnets: yes 3@C inv is attractive|pg||
nt|dagold: defence must play a trump but im sure they will|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  4 in a major is playable 4 @s better perhaps -but you may have 4 losers -so lets see|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|dburn: still, South can't really find out whether slam is cold, good or hopeless, so may just bid it anyway in case it's not the last|pg||
nt|psyck: other room RKCed after Sabine showed a poor opening & stopped in 6@s|pg||
nt|barnets: south looks pretty strong for n/f|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: after all, a first-seat vulnerable Frenchman will have something for a weak two bid|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dburn: and this isn't an obvious lead for Bertheau|pg||
nt|ady: KX clubs with south helps|pg||
nt|dburn: so he made a non-obvious one|pg||
nt|dburn: but even with no trump loser, it's not easy to see ten winners for Konow|pg||
nt|dagold: not best start|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Sorry, 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i also have a note that says 3rd seat often balanced so not sure why he chose 1@D rather than 1N|pg||
nt|dagold: other room NS playing 3@d !|pg||
nt|runnerup:  1nt looks better as preventing north to bid majors -very sure|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and this time again 1nt opening -north is in with majors and they play partial in @s -very normal |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  but has to be said that south has a lot |pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: will lose a trump when trying to ruff hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: difficult to see 9th, leave alone 10th|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - Bertheau may have felt that even if he blew a spade trick on the go, the ability to get another round of trumps in after ruffing a heart would compensate|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, may be a relatively new addition. I seem to recall they have upped their 1NT to 14-16 in third hand, and maybe fourth|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|runnerup:  3nt looks best but with 6-3 in @h they bid 4 @h which looks to have 10 top tricks also as it is|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup:  and 4 @s without any gaps|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dburn: indeed - South took his eye off the ball for a moment|pg||

nt|barnets: and the pass was a big mistake|pg||
nt|dagold: this is the wrong spot but likely to survive|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe just a simple 4@d to cater for 4@s?|pg||
nt|dagold: north needs to lead the spade King to beat it otherwise the lucky spade poisition lets it make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck: so the 1@s on deal 3 was NT response...|pg||
nt|dburn: East will need to lead high rather than low in diamonds now|pg||

pc|dA|nt|dburn: science in use at the other table also, but a shorter auction and a low diamond lead|pg||
nt|psyck: South trying to figure what pd was trying too|pg||
nt|dburn: the Italians have a theory that you lead high from this kind of suit if your third-highest card is the eight or the nine|pg||
nt|psyck: surely the beer card rates more than some measly 8 or 9|pg||
nt|dburn: I do not think they drink much beer in Italy - maybe they have a Barolo card|pg||
nt|psyck: some kibs suggest that N was trying to get S to bid NT|pg||

nt|psyck: 2N generally ask for the kind of raise|pg||
nt|barnets: I dont see much play in 6@D looks like a trump and spade to lose|pg||
nt|dburn: still, bidding 2@c and then 3@s was perhaps more of an overbid than 2@s was an underbid|pg||

nt|bigtrain: declarer was unlucky east held the AK if he held any other honor combination the situation would have been disguised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only at end of match|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Declarer will likely misguess hearts here but will still make|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn: "who", as someone memorably asked, "are those guys?"|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Michael Schreiber and Bob Etter both have multiple national wins -- but not as partners|pg||
nt|henryb:  Brink after a close call yesterday was dominant today|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I was asking out of admiration (as was Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://bridgewinners.com/tournament/2012-summer-nabc-spingold/grid/    you may need to refresh screen to see updates|pg||
nt|barnets: no other major upsets|pg||
nt|barnets: poor sam lev lost the gnt on grandslam last board when he stopped in 6|pg||
nt|barnets: and now gos out early|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  4 @h looks difficult -3nt makes if you guess rigth minor finess|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|runnerup:  yes 4 @h makes sorry |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, unbal  4+@D, maybe longer @C|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N EW is a make on the nice diamond layout|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lucky 3nt |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: conservative 2@h - invite anyone? |pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h has chances |pg||
pc|c8|nt|dagold: 4@h looks easy to me|pg||
nt|dagold: diamond going on 3rd spade|pg||
nt|dagold: south made an interesting play of the @d K on the last hand. hoping to shut out the diamonds if declarer had say xx|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@CXX would have been exciting|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some dont like to take funny points like 2 @c XX|pg||
nt|dagold: surprised W didnt try 2@c with super max hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  46[5@DN=]  Welland in 3@C south after opening 2@S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|dagold: in 3N you need to take right minor suit finness|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe play say @c Q from dummy and if it is not covered, rise ace and take the diamond hook|pg||
nt|barnets: i think souths xx asked for norths major and north forgot the system|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: I think North bid 2@S over rdbl|pg||
nt|dagold: but north has shown clubs of course so  not likely|pg||
nt|barnets: aha |pg||
nt|dagold: a squeeze/ endplay possible if north has both kings|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: 2@C was @C and a major|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north has bid 2 @c so @d finess must be odds in the end|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps just play a couple of rounds of hearts and exit with a spade|pg||
nt|dagold: then north must give you a 9th|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so this was a shortcut -in table north bid 2 @s |pg||
nt|barnets: yes that looks right david|pg||
nt|runnerup:  maybe endplay -after 5 @h play @s is best as sayed by audience|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  In the other room 2@D was a bad overcall with a major|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2008worldmindsportgames-beijing/openteams/denmark/Askgaard-Bjarnarsson.pdf|pg||
pc|dT|nt|runnerup:  or 3 times |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: David alreay gave the best play|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: even with diamonds wrong  ok|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|barnets: you dont want to cash your hearts and play spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if north has AKxxx in @s you have 100% -like take 3 @h and play @s -north is endplayed|pg||
nt|barnets: as your own hand is squeezed|pg||
nt|dagold: 3 rounds of spades would have been a better start but then the diamond finness makes it|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|dagold: cash maybe 2@h then you can throw 1@h and say a diamond on the 4th and 5th spade|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|runnerup:  that -unnesessary 3 @h -was worth 5 for Amoils|pg||

nt|dburn: if East-West knew the state of things, they might take a shot at game here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|dburn: they might anyway, of course - not so far short of the values|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no checkback -- probably meanse 2@H=non invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Del'Monte has a lot of wasted values in minors|pg||
nt|dburn: but Ish will need to raise here, and he really doesn't have it - unless a 2@h response would have been weaker with 5-4 majors, as some play|pg||
nt|barnets: he needs to id to keep match alive|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dburn: he did raise|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: they already missed a vul game that is the margin of match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this isn't Roland's last board grand off 2 bullets, but still ...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: those of you old enough to remember the Bee Gees can now sing a quick chorus of "Stayin' Alive"|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|barnets: if they make it it is 7 imps|pg||
nt|barnets: down to 4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, he still has to make it|pg||
nt|barnets: extra boards if match tied|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: but he's in good shape to do that now|pg||
nt|barnets: if the match is tied there is 8 board overtime|pg||
nt|barnets: I once played a double overtime|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checking the movie to see what other table did on 64 is cheating|pg||
nt|barnets: tied after overtime|pg||

nt|runnerup:  46|pg||
nt|phil: and they might get 6 more here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|dagold: 3N failing in the other room here on a @h lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set    final 16 of the match scheduled to begin in about 20 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dagold: chance for amoils as 5@d is making, 6 infact|pg||
nt|runnerup:  no 2 @h -so this time east had a bid |pg||
mb|d|nt|runnerup:  can you make 4 @h in table -how to handle @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5+@H, 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so last board and still we dont know who wins ---tx all bye -lets see this still|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dagold: interesting treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [in case Ole didn't already mention that]|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: 1@h = spades|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s = weak no trump|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: 1heart shows spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tx all -nice session again and bye  @d slam here as cards are -|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tx all -nice session again -bye |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  I didn't (know)|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|oleberg:  Seems logical to have the weak hand bid NT on the hand-type that is least likely to end up in NT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: more of an issue with relays than right-siding contracts|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: maybe 3@h by north? stiff heart would worry me, but perhaps this is too tough|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: more IMPs to Amoils when Denmark bid 6@d rather than 6@s and did not find Deep Finesse's line|pg||
nt|ady: stopped nice and low|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session  thx all|pg||
nt|lokaty: and what is the punishment for playing 3 NT -1 when 6 in minor is cold?:)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  both ns pairs must be angry to them selves|pg||
nt|phil: this should let it in|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: essentially, the overcall just pushed their normal response structure up by 1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  what are the odds in @h here?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|phil: important not to relinquish trump control here and work on the minors first|pg||
nt|phil: you can give up a few ruffs and be OK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1:  47 Bertheau playing 3@D west|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|barnets: if he plays the 8 west has to work it out|pg||
nt|barnets: to play the K next|pg||
nt|dagold: thanks all, been good tight bridge|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry he opened 1@H|pg||
nt|barnets: cancel that|pg||
nt|dagold: now i must light the BBQ, figuring if i do summer type things, we might actually have a summer|pg||
nt|dagold: not working yet|pg||
nt|barnets: hope the weather works for bbq|pg||
nt|phil: must be a big one to burn off the English fog? |pg||
nt|dagold: 'apparantly' summer might come next week when this blasted weather system moves|pg||

nt|Walddk2: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: so far, so good, but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought Ish would pass|pg||
nt|dburn: South may reopen this on the way out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but will he DBL or try 2@S?|pg||
nt|barnets: can e/w make 3@H ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: he will double, I imagine|pg||
nt|dburn: but East may compete to 3@h|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N scramble or natural -- both fit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: That should be 1 down though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: he did, which at least means no overtime|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: 3@D was down1|pg||
nt|dburn: and now the defenders need to get around to clubs in time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This looks flat but you never know|pg||
nt|dburn: but that ought not to be hard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should be plenty of time to switch to @C before @S setup|pg||
nt|barnets: for 4 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And maybe we missed a few IMPs somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 IMPs how?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You mean 0|pg||
nt|barnets: 50 and 110|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: There were several disconnects earlier. Don't assume scores are perfect.|pg||
nt|dburn: if East had passed 3@d, that was 4 IMPs to Amoils|pg||
nt|dburn: assuming he beat it by not leading a heart|pg||
nt|henryb:  David, South was playing 3@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good choice by Jan Martel to select this match. It has been very exciting|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, so East could beat it by not leading a heart out of turn|pg||
nt|barnets: yes thats true|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: We got all 64 boards of this match, which is quite unusual|pg||
