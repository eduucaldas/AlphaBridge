pc|hA|nt|grebrof: Upmark trying to show he has a good hand with long @ds, @cs and single @h|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: probably its a Stayman modification to find a possible 5-3 fit in a major|pg||
pc|h6|nt|grebrof: I think it is only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: on a diamond lead slam has not any play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees has only shown game force ALL of his bids just say  tell me more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N clarifies 4225|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: van Prooijen doubletons could be weak or strong ...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: so Verhees on a guess  [i bet final contract will be 4@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H for signoff|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|barnets: on another lead dec could hope|pg||
nt|barnets: to establish the 5th club|pg||
nt|barnets: which we see|pg||
nt|barnets: does not work here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: van Prooijen writing out South's exact hand for Nickell|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OR  sets @S  and 4@S says not interested in slam |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, east has to hold both @cs and @s|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@D a better contract than 3nt.  it can make even without @D's breaking 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: now at least he thinks he has play|pg||
pc|h9|nt|warrens:  also, won't go down as many when you do go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nystrom says "yuck" as he puts down dummy|pg||

pc|h3|pc|c5|nt|barnets: @CQJX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP could have cooperated with better hand|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Meckstroth played his first card a little fast for me - he actually played 7-3-8 of @hs|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|barnets: or a 4-3 split with 2 entries|pg||
nt|barnets: hes trying to get the entries|pg||
nt|barnets: if the clubs were 4-3 north would have to duck|pg||
nt|barnets: or win and play hear back|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: Some alert on 1@H, it's natural but may deny an unbalanced hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Dana  i'll type faster|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: More fevered whisipering on the N/E side of the screen.  All I got was from Bobby: "six spades and two diamonds?" ... for what it's worth.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D can have 4+@D and 5+@S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: fewer @D only if  4414/4405 or weak NT|pg||
mb|4N|mb|d|an|alerted, Ricco is scribbling|nt|ahollan1: EW system called Ultimate Canape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is also being played in other quarter-final match by Ekeblad-Weichsel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL willing to hear partner to compete in @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Now we'll see how good/large their handwriting is... I'm gonna guess that I won't be able to read whatever Ricco wrote.  No alert of the double on the other side of the screen.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: .... he wrote a few lines ending with "but this situation is new."  :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it is used more often after responder jumps to game in known suit|pg||

nt|grebrof: someone told me they made 12 at the other table too, so maybe its still a draw :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yes - at least that is what they said - Rosenberg must have pitched a club; play went very fast in the middle|pg||
nt|barnets: so match is now tied|pg||
nt|april7: good defence denying the overtrick|pg||
nt|szalay: partscore is coming|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = 3-suiter short D 10-15|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can be 43 in the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|not invitational|mb|3D|nt|warrens:  East is squeezed if he didn't cash the club K first|pg||
nt|grebrof: when S had bid @cs, maybe he just gave up|pg||
nt|grebrof: dont think the @c K mattered|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, we'll assume declarer cashed all his trumps, leaving dummy with @S 10 and Qx of @C|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very sharp 3nt has chances|pg||
nt|april7: could end in a 1NT byS|pg||
nt|april7: E will bid 1H |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Willenken alerts 2@C and was writing; then realized it was not an alert|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'd rather be in 5@C, since either they don't get trumps started OR I ruff out Kxx of @H's|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @H or @D lead 3nt most likely doomed and a black lead almost sure makes|pg||
nt|april7: might bid 1@H:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|barnets: ttrump start does not work for def|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  rather than 3NT.  but 3NT is cold on 4-3 @D's|pg||
nt|barnets: as east has only 1  trump|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is always cold warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  on a trump lead?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  if trump are 2-2?|pg||
nt|barnets: they are not|pg||
nt|barnets: her|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jaapfr: S did pass (i would X)|pg||
nt|szalay: likely @H lead after given bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I kinda like bidding with Ss hand - double is weired for me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink asking about minor suit distributions that would open 1@D|pg||
nt|april7: so its not S who plays 1NT but E, since N showed majors E decided for 1NT,a good decision|pg||
nt|szalay: will they find @C shift by SOUTH?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then it is too late|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to get their 8 tricks|pg||
mb|4H|an|COG|mb|d|nt|warrens:  on this hand, 5@C is cold, but in theory it's a cold choice between 3NT and 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckstroth led @H7  after similar auction  but 2@H dbl neg rather than controls|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X is usually anti-lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hard not to think that they are having a misunderstanding though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Meck wrote something that I thought said he doesn't want a heart lead, and now Brink asked something more and he wrote some more (small & light, couldn't read) and then turned the ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: page upside down :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|warrens:  close choise|pg||
nt|warrens:  close choice*|pg||
nt|april7: the very bad @D distribution will lead to the downfall of this contract,making only 1@D,1@C,2@H and 2@S tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink hasn't turned over his K@H yet.  Lots of thinking going on.|pg||
nt|april7: with a play to the 10 of @S from dummy, E might even make 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how many would play here X as responsive as NS?|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  this makes 4@H's if you can guess the @H's, but not easy after W's opening bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe dbl is both majors or @d and a major then|pg||
nt|grebrof: you risk P bidding @s|pg||
nt|barnets: you see north bid 2N in open|pg||
nt|april7: except S finds the @C switch |pg||
nt|april7: wll Levin find now the winning path?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but it may turn out to be a blessing here...  since an early @H ead alows a @S pitch|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: and Zagorin did try Stayman with west hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  the 4-1 @D break makes this even more difficult|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nickell congratulated van Proojien on not flying with the Queen on trick 1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: rump lead seems right after the anti-heart X|pg||
nt|bigtrain: COG = choice of games|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Now Meck asked if 3@s was forcing and Brink wrote an answer and Meck put it on the floor - I'm going to have to explain to him about all of you wanting to know what's on the notes ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|grebrof: E must have something for his bid, but it can just as likely be and H in @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  upside-down count & attitude  1st discard = odd/even|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: ty W|pg||
nt|april7: now @C switch is easy to find,what else|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont think they underbid in any case|pg||
nt|barnets: while QX is a great holding when partner has Jxx or the K or A it is not so good here|pg||
nt|barnets: Perhaps north could have tried 2@D instead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Just got confirmation of what Al said about discards and attitiude, but I missed a trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: in usa the major part of the top would see X as S here as d bid a suit|pg||
nt|szalay: last call for @C, done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier for EW   standard carding :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Since they are showing 2-2, South must have won 2nd diamond with K|pg||

nt|barnets: another close slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but me a lousy memory|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe variable then?|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H might be reached and made, while 3NT is doomed on a @D lead ofcourse|pg||
nt|bigtrain: operator noted 14-16 on 1st board though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Definitely variable NT, didn't hear the range though.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is the better single (3fit) @H raise|pg||

mb|2H|nt|grebrof: pass|pg||
nt|barnets: which has no play on a @D lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|warrens:  this is slam on a lead.  I don't usually think depending on the wrong lead is a good idea, but I have seen some exceptions :)|pg||
nt|barnets: you see norths imaginative 3! D bid|pg||
nt|barnets: which would not occur to most of us|pg||
nt|warrens:  Fredin likes to bid, as we see here.  with 4 small @H's, he's assuming his partner has a fit|pg||

nt|joest:  1@d-1@h-1@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-1@H//1@S-2@C//2@S- ?|pg||
nt|joest:  btw there is some case to be made for responding 2@h, a good old fashioned jump shift|pg||
nt|joest:  so over 2@s north would bid 3@d I would think|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with shape meckwell overcall very aggressively|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I rather upgrade my 14 or 17 - allthou you did jackpot in @hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meck started with 1@D in context of big club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I would open 1@S - I have a decent suit and my partners assume I don't have 5 of them if I don't open 1@S.|pg||
nt|joest:  then he is free to jump around aggressively having already lmited his hand with his failure to open 1@c|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they do look down their noses at 5332 especially|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: I can't bring up N-S's card on this computer, no Adobe|pg||
nt|joest:  well back at the actual table, north has selected 4@s after his partner shows 5-6?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chase from the Steve Robinson skool  -- if you don't open 5-card major, YOU DON'T HAVE ONE|pg||
nt|joest:  i am not from that school|pg||
nt|joest:  you never get to six diamonds opposite Ax if your start with 1@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: van Prooijen wrote 3NT as 5152, but 4@S sets diamonds as trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  all of the 4-level bids artificial|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Verhees wrote 5062|pg||
nt|joest:  ic 4@s sets @ds as trumps|pg||
nt|joest:  this i didn't know|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|ady: this may be down 2|pg||
nt|dinos1: -5 with trump lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right 4@C=@H 4@D=@S 4@H=@C 4@S=@D|pg||
nt|joest:  with hearts behaving, 7@d will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S = likes slam and shows keycards  [5@D would reject]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2KC + Q and likes hand|pg||
nt|joest:  are they still relaying or have they reverted to cue bidding?|pg||
nt|joest:  ok thanks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|clinch: Will do well to get out for -1 in 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: likely to get club wrong|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes N has implied short clubs|pg||
nt|ady: think 2NT was just competitive   but west decided 3@C better spot|pg||
nt|clinch: Declarer knows S short in @h, so may play top @cs|pg||
nt|clinch: to avoid ruff|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S was very likely to make  so will need to restrict to 1 down for a push|pg||
nt|clinch: but then there's the matter of the third @s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyone understands X on 5@C in OR?|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be a fast 420, just 3 IMPs loss|pg||
pc|c8|nt|warrens:  Martel might pull to show interest in slam|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, he did.  he wants Zia to bid 6 with short @D's for sure|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|barnets: so e/w exchange 1100 for 650|pg||
nt|dinos1: but would Zia bid 4@h with stiff @d and @cAK?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: only 3@d bid could prevent to opps to bid 6@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the artificial bid sort of becomes Optional RKC|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest:  helpful for north to know he is facing a heart void since that substantially diminishes the chances of suit establishment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckstroth in 6@D after fewer bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|barnets: I dont believe that for a secon|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: could give 2 heart ruffs now  and 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: oissubly 3 down  3 diamond later promoting Q@C|pg||
nt|ady: possibly|pg||
nt|ady: 3rd diamond|pg||
nt|ady: heart at this point could hardly cost|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|szalay: 4, sry|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  35  Drijver playing 4@S south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will extend Nickell lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 24-0 in 3 boards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfk: First Ricco was sighing, now it's Bobby's turn...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Ooooh Zia has called the director at the next table.  They step aside to have a chat.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Apparently Louk has shown 5-5 in the roundeds in theory; Bobby closes the screen to ask Ricco a few questions and now opens the screen and slouches a little deeper.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was careful to avoid talking about 3@C :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: It seems that the resolution of the Zia-director call at the other table is that team Monaco conceded the trick in question.  Crisis averted.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i knew 2@C would be natural and forcing   wasn't sure if 3@C was supposed to be 55 or canape|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ady: looks a routine 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 16+ any|pg||
mb|1D|nt|joest:  what would you rebid here al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm trying to decide if makes sense to play @HK at trick 3 to see if anything interesting happens in the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: This table plays much faster than Levin-Weinstein and Brink Drijver did|pg||
nt|joest:  if Ralph had ropped the heart queen under teh king it would have been very interesting|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 0-7 any|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: could be lucky the single was vs an ace in @ds, but its stretching a lot - I guess they bid games that they bid at the other table and hope for something lucky to happen|pg||
nt|barnets: so 3 hands played 3 big swings exciting stuff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5-fit  and imps -- don't worry about bypassing 3N|pg||
nt|joest:  i prefer somewhat bigger hands for 4@c and would bid 4@d, promising 5 trumps, but that is stylistic|pg||
nt|joest:  i agree about bagging 3n5|pg||
nt|joest:  3nt|pg||
mb|1H|nt|warrens:  1@S=denies a 4-card Major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx chase|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@H is probably stronger @S|pg||
nt|april7: from both sides apartscore only,4@C by NS and 3@S by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession:  i didn't think about 4@D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Seems we missed a big swing board on 17 - NS here gained 13 despite missing a slam.... in the other room they bid a doomed 7@d|pg||
nt|joest:  I taught Ralph everything he knows :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grasshopper has learned well|pg||
mb|2D|nt|clinch: 18|pg||
nt|szalay: @H lead/switch: 1off in 4@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they only play 3@C|pg||
nt|szalay: and @D lead beats 3@S|pg||
nt|april7: double dummy thereare only 3@C and 2@S to be made, due to the possible ruffs from both sides|pg||
nt|joest:  so now Nickell needs to highlight the heart weakness unless he wants to roll the dice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you were both in chicago at same time?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  which will come up 7s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = 3fit 5-7 ART|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jaapfr: zia in 3nt?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink and Levin writing furiously, can't make it out|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2NT = GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Upmark:  "this should have chances"|pg||
nt|warrens:  a coffee hand (a good hand to get up and get a cup of coffee)|pg||
nt|joest:  nice auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i thought you migrated to florida|pg||
nt|joest:  me?  no :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some play 4@D as minorwook  [RKC in the minor]|pg||
nt|joest:  but make me an offer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: minorwood|pg||
nt|joest:  this can be more complex than it seems|pg||
nt|joest:  it is possible 4@h would have been minorwood|pg||
nt|joest:  and 4NT a heart cue|pg||
nt|joest:  so did Katz read 5@c as a command to bid on with heart control?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i call that kickback|pg||
nt|joest:  kickback too :)|pg||
nt|joest:  in other words, can Nickell 'trust' the 5@d call he just heard?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would assume forced to slam if @H control|pg||
nt|joest:  i tend to agree but if it were that clear Nickell would have already sent the green pass card out there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder what 4@S instead of 5@C would say/ask|pg||
nt|joest:  how could that not be an offer to play|pg||
nt|joest:  if you took the king of clubs out of Nickell's hand, that's the bid we would all make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|joest:  i have a good idea what Verhees will lead if Nickell bids on|pg||
nt|joest:  it's 80% nickell will pass (imho)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 50/50   he does or he doesn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin did splinter|pg||
nt|joest:  when partner is 5-5 and the auction has gone this way, in your heart you just know partner has xx in hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D = natural|pg||
mb|3N|nt|clinch: Not sure what 3@h is here|pg||
nt|grebrof: many would have bid 2@d as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just noticed  5@C does fit RKC response|pg||
nt|joest:  last makeable spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2KC + Q|pg||
nt|joest:  i admit I would not know what was going on if I were in West's seat :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  1@S-2@D//4@C-4@D//4@S-5@S|pg||
nt|joest:  so I would follow my baseline rule|pg||
nt|joest:  when in doubt...|pg||
nt|joest:  pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough hand when you're only looking at 13 cards|pg||
nt|joest:  yes let's see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither west has passed 5@S yet|pg||
nt|joest:  if 4@d were rkcb, then 5@c is 2 with|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3nt down 2 i would say|pg||
nt|joest:  then 5@d asked and 5@s showed the spade king?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|barnets: going to 3N all roads here|pg||
nt|warrens:  I've been told by some 1@S is a GF, others that its inv+|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1@s is relay and shows INV+ values|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: S dont want to lead|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, rather odd bidding on the face of it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: b4 zia has 52 different cards kibs:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Note passed to other side of table.  Brink wanted to know difference between 2@S, Pass, and XX.|pg||
nt|joest:  i.e. if all these bids mean something else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin 5N  so  great position for Nickell|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he's suppose to bid his suits up the line here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: we started hand 19  ?|pg||

nt|szalay: 4 top losers and another one in "wash"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y marginal chances to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming Ralph Katz makes safety play in trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  on a bad day north has Jxxx of trumps and you are punished for this transgression|pg||
nt|bigtrain: reaching the norma 4@H contract though|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|clinch: Guess we were late to the party|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Zia's at the table currently talking to Weinstein.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Meck will make at least 2@S|pg||
nt|joest:  a classic Namyats call for East|pg||
nt|joest:  4@d as an artifical "good 4@s bid"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: He had 6 until the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  Namyats being Stayman backward.  I've never known why that convention was named that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: because invented by Stayman's PARTNER   Vic Mitchell :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus70: 4h likely unmakeable spot|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: good result for e/w here with n/s cold in minor|pg||
nt|barnets: for 9 tricks in @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@D is likely a fit showing jump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I believe that is how it was alerted|pg||
mb|4H|nt|barnets: or 10 if you guess clubs|pg||
nt|odysseus70: maybe a good stop if north bids 3D (he has as I type)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that 1N overcall is called Raptor 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: inventor of stayman -- depends upon which side of pond your on|pg||
nt|joest:  and those who play raptor swear by it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north americans say  George Rapee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: europeans ...   ach   brain cramp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Macleod??|pg||

nt|jaapfr: N never did bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I couldn't hear.  But Steve did thank Zia just now and chuckled.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had good results with Raptor  because of hands it shows and inferences from 2@C/@D overcall NOT having 4OM|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @SQ is rusinow...  they lead the lower of touching honors from known length|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Bas is in deep thought|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Jeff is stretching as he waits|pg||
pc|h4|nt|clinch: On 19 NS in the closed room also had a chance to defend 3@c, but pressed on to 3@s which came home|pg||
nt|clinch: the open room I mean|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1@d was @h's|pg||
nt|barnets: north did not supports partners @D bi in open room|pg||
nt|odysseus70: killing lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but never felt comfortable having to DBL with strong NT|pg||
nt|joest:  and how do you handle a strong nt overcall?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: skewed ability to RESPOND to DBL|pg||
nt|joest:  ic  you just answered that|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck's spot will be u/d suit preference|pg||
pc|s6|nt|warrens:  makes with a @H lead.  down on this lead, especially if W overtakes and continues the suit|pg||
nt|barnets: at the 3 level|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|warrens:  a Fredinian lead here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus70: bid slam on last in open room|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H switch pretty tough|pg||
nt|april7: @C King and @H switch and then develop the @D trick, but no entry to this trick, so 2 @S will make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @S6 = @D interest|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Who goes up with the A here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Clocl has 10 minutes left for the 5th set of 8 boards. They are behind right now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Clock*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: For all of those wondering, Jeff is still thinking|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this may be the longest break in tempo i've seen from meck|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: He took his hands off the cards again. We have 5 minutes to finish this board and play 39 as well as 40|pg||
nt|bigtrain: his is one of the fastest and smoothest players you'll ever watch|pg||
pc|dA|nt|warrens:  if E shifts to a @S, W has to go up and exit a @C|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is getting difficult for the defense|pg||
nt|grebrof: can shift @hs too?|pg||
nt|warrens:  on a @H, declarer knocks out the @S ace and has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|grebrof: Zia has some inventive weak 2s sometimes|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, yes, W can win the spade Ace and shift to a @H|pg||
nt|grebrof: not if play the ace first and then shift @hs|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe Willenken should have overtaken seeing the 9 in dummy and played @ds|pg||
nt|grebrof: I see you already commented on that, but I was in the office :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  that would have worked, but of course he was worried that declarer had K or QJ of @H's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Played|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: this shift looks nice|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: logic defense but only @H return it could go down|pg||
nt|april7: deep finesse in @S|pg||
nt|szalay: why deep?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS have actually changed in last year -- now they play Strong NT overcall after 3rd seat opener|pg||
nt|joest:  nickell may hook the club and be disappointed to see it lose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very sensible modification from the current bermuda bowl holders|pg||
nt|joest:  but he really can't go down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckstroth made overtrick in 2@S for extra pip|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this board  Meckstroth DBL  Rodwell 2@C  --- VERY different inferences for Bathurst in 4@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|clinch: Looks like 9 tricks as long as W doesn't rise on a club to dummy|pg||
nt|szalay: just a finesse|pg||
nt|april7: to take out both @S from N's hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hard work for a push|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs to score 5 trump and 3 aces...  so has to set up some ruffs in his hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|warrens:  W needs to go up or he can be endplayed|pg||
nt|barnets: here diamonds showed hearts|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|warrens:  J of @S asking for a @H|pg||

pc|cK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|barnets: there diamonds showed diamonds i think|pg||
nt|barnets: but not sure|pg||

nt|grebrof: I cant see them coming there now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@SX-2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but how to bid 3nt now?|pg||
nt|szalay: to pull 3N card from bidding box:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|warrens:  I don't think N will let them stop at 3NT even if they do get there|pg||
nt|grebrof: that is completely sure|pg||
nt|grebrof: 4@cs now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only one way (think these guys are bluffing and bid eyes closed 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: quiet hand here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H RELAY for shortness  but vP already suspects @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: LMH responses|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT is quasi-forcing|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D rates to be 4+|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is NF|pg||
mb|3C|nt|clinch: N must feel 4@s may be making|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 5@C still ok|pg||
nt|joest:  "LMH" = low-middle-high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: LMH = low middle high   so step 1=short @C  step 2=short @D  step 3=short other major|pg||
nt|reisig: This is GREAT ..we have no comments :)|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S would imply 6 imo|pg||
mb|3S|nt|barnets: you are watching in my opinion 2 of the world's most imaginative bridge players|pg||
nt|odysseus70: 3NT HAS no chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Found the best contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: bidding what you have is maybe just for the better|pg||
nt|grebrof: now its easy for N bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe W should have bid 5@c instead of XX|pg||
nt|grebrof: or 3nt|pg||
nt|grebrof: if P has the @c K and an ace 3nt makes|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@H probably cue for @Cs, with @D fit he could bid 5@C|pg||
nt|szalay: 5@C isnt so easy|pg||
nt|szalay: 4/5 @D, I think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better 5@C than 5@D to make|pg||
nt|szalay: Levin visualize void in @S by pd|pg||
nt|szalay: in that case 6@C is a good prposition|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y might go for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i don't remember  possible 4@S = mild slam try|pg||
mb|d|nt|grebrof: the bidding at the other table was shorter and not very much to my liking :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, back now.  let me see...|pg||
nt|reisig: Warren was hiding|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm back now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: it would be to your liking on this hand if you were NS :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, surely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha tx phil (4@S bid if W 0 @S) agree|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and not 5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: In the other room, Ralph Katz opened 1@D in 3rd seat, Dan Zagorin overcalled 1NT and they reached 3NT.|pg||
nt|april7: only a @D lead might have made some problems, because W has to pull trumps and religh on a very good @H position|pg||
nt|april7: rely*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with NS passing 5@C an easy one |pg||
nt|jaapfr: bbut with the ino W will think a lot|pg||
nt|jaapfr: info|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how could he bid 1@S  and how 3@S (awful breaks ahead?|pg||
nt|april7: 5 trumps, 2@H, 3 @D and 1 @S trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy:) but thinking ahead|pg||
nt|april7: not vuln. you cantry a lot|pg||
nt|jaapfr: esp when S shows @DA W will become very un sure about @HK|pg||
nt|april7: can't misguess, S will not duck the K imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we will see (i quess in 10 minutes:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think 3@S showed a mixed raise, so that could help some.|pg||
nt|szalay: rehi|pg||
nt|szalay: may be here will a slow play penalty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: They have 5 hours to play 32 boards, but are way off pace.  This hand isn't helping obviously.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least W agrees with me:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very tough board to play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink pulled out wintermint Tic Tacs, and offered them to the table.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4@D forcing 4@H for signoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell now 3 1-imp pickups in a row  what's the record?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  that's what I was wondering|pg||
nt|joest:  obviously north turned off by heart shortness|pg||
nt|joest:  but how does south know who much strength north has in case south wants to move on?|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  N/S need to find 5@H's now or they will lose a  lot of imps|pg||
nt|clinch: In these situations often advisable to bid one more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: After long thought, Bas X's it.|pg||

nt|bigtrain: X = 3fit|pg||
nt|reisig: 3NT won't make at this table|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h might, though|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tez: Fallenius didnt open 3@c..may be he misscounted points:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  3NT pretty odd contract with these cards, but 4@H will do fine|pg||
nt|reisig: indeed :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|clinch: that's an interesting pass|pg||
nt|ady: dontlike that balance  with that lot|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: I would think south could do something more robust  for north to consider game|pg||
nt|odysseus70: dont know where this one will end -maybe 6 clubs going down-maybe 4 hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus70: South will have shown 5 diamonds 6 clubs and a strong hand|pg||
nt|odysseus70: the 7th club is compensation for modest high cardelement|pg||
nt|szalay: surprise silence by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wager 2@H can be 3-fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe Nickell balances 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: south opened 3@C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|clinch: yes 1@h must have been limited|pg||
nt|barnets: which gave e/w the opportunity to make a wrong decision|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1:  26  Rodwell using Exclusion Keycard after    1@D[precision 2+]-1@S//3@S-5@D|pg||

nt|reisig: good idea :)|pg||
nt|reisig: brb|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 40 minutes left in quarter|pg||
nt|dburn: three rounds of spades might have saved an overtrick, I guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|clinch: I'm told 1@h showed 11-14 with 2 or 3 @hs|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|Vugraphzff: Katz confirmed could have been 3|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes - they play so slow, some has finished it already|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Willenken and Rosenberg are not known for their speed|pg||
nt|dburn: but this...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: nah, that they are not|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H not easy SD|pg||
pc|s4|nt|grebrof: but 99% play too fast, so they are probably right|pg||
nt|barnets: neither west nor east made a terrible bid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: ..may not be the best|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|barnets: and there you are|pg||
nt|dburn: if Brink had ducked that heart....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaapfr: how many kibs expected 4nt and how many pass?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|clinch: going a few down, certainly on a trump switch|pg||
nt|ady: not easy for north to play south with KQX spades|pg||

nt|ady: true|pg||

nt|ahollan1: is Bobby thinking or Ricco?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Bobby is thinking, head in his hands.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how good can Weinstein be for 3@H that Levin has problem with that drek?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3N or 4@S?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: And now Bobby's writing something down: "I think GOOD [unreadable from here]"|pg||

nt|joest:  which major would you lead al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you mean i can't lead @D10???|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: light opening from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession -- i lead @S|pg||
nt|joest:  BTW, there is a new book out I would recommend by David Bird on leading against NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|odysseus70: support double- mandatory tool for many|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y ok X 4@C and later 4nt is included|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: they might be slow, but how they treat every hand is better than the common player - a lot is experience thou|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  it is a statistical (probabilistic) analysis of what actually works what % of the time|pg||
nt|joest:  it is quite interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can i borrow your copy?|pg||
nt|joest:  on this, I think a case can be made for leading hearts, relying on the spade ace as your side entry but a spade could clearly work|pg||
nt|joest:  sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 2@h +6@s to play or GF (I think)|pg||
nt|reisig: 3N = I respect you :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzff: 7th best leads? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear why this went down at the other table|pg||
pc|h6|nt|clinch: 25 points NS; looks as though they may make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|grebrof: 3nt maybe nonserious slamtry|pg||
nt|grebrof: invitational + it was|pg||
nt|ady: 9|pg||
nt|ady: declare can make 3 club tricks  playing low to 10 or queen  and then playing the other honour from north  pinning the 98 doubleton with west|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|grebrof: its kinda popular to play that now - 2@d being same with @hs I assume|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it is only about finding @SQ this 3nt|pg||
nt|bigtrain: even a @S to the king will work|pg||
nt|reisig: Seems  - kinda straight forward|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a  @S too K is down imho|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 9 tricks|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|odysseus70: 3 rounds of hearts then 10 of clubs killing the jack|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|barnets: i would like to check on 5-3 major fit if north could have one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: 3@s is maybe kinda strange if its to play|pg||
nt|ady: west better to have continued spades|pg||
nt|ady: was that the J@D played at trick 2 Don? from East|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd play @s to King - not trying to win a MP event here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Now he needs to find Queen of @S|pg||

nt|barnets: fit jump|pg||
nt|barnets: spades and hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus70: same book|pg||
nt|ahollan1: me too   but there is a large group that bids 1@S whenever they have 4|pg||
nt|joest:  btw, when I play standard I still like strong jump shifts to hte two level.  Here I could bid 2@h then 3@c and have a lot of this hand bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: including Nickell teammates, meckwell|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: and its 3 more sessions after this, which can be seen at; http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|grebrof: the update is at best "live"|pg||
nt|warrens:  Willenken considering whether to bid 3NT or show a good hand with @C's|pg||
nt|tez: i like pass..you?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|tez: Zia's|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like e/w will check for keys an bid 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Weinstein asking what hand types are shown in 1@S|pg||
nt|reisig: @h part score - seems normal|pg||
nt|dburn: well, game not much worse that a finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you all confused me (my first anlysis was right the 3nt was all about finding @SQ)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  that works on some hands for sure but in my experience rebidding 1Nt with hands like this works on many more including ones where we 'miss' our spade fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong natural jump shift    cute toy|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is a good vul game, not much more than a finesse (no quick ruffs also)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: 2@S is a fit jump spades and hearts |pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, clear road|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 1 and void|pg||
nt|barnets: some play that as 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, it's a pretty good fit and not easy to know that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Any idea why he leads K with Rusinow?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tez: not important 4 card @h..but he has bad opener suit|pg||
nt|barnets: if the void was clubs 7@H may work|pg||
nt|phil: isn't 5N generally an even number and an unknown void? |pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  interesting question whether this is RKC for @H's or @s's|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk unknown void|pg||
nt|tez: 5 NT 1/3 KC And void|pg||
nt|barnets: it is clearly hearts Warren|pg||
nt|phil: sounds like he thought it was spades - or maybe 6-ace|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3 by PH is impossible :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@S agrees hearts|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think it should be @H's, but don't most people play 5NT shows 2 KC's + void?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes they do|pg||
nt|phil: but Fredin won't lead the @cA will he? |pg||
nt|dinos1: by UPH mb|pg||
nt|tez: ýf @c void easy 7|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps Zia misbid or they play other responses|pg||
nt|phil: depends on partner's spades....|pg||
nt|barnets: their  partnership is new|pg||
nt|tez: Martel sure pd has not @s void:)|pg||
nt|phil: counting on a misbid in a new partnership seems like a reasonable possiblility |pg||
nt|odysseus70: diamond lead kills this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: time for a break|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: not a forgone conclusion|pg||
nt|clinch: Presumably 2@s over the double confirmed at least 3|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|grebrof: 9 aces|pg||
nt|ady: could lose 2 spades 1 heart and 1 club|pg||
nt|ady: thats how most play|pg||
nt|clinch: May not have the entries to take that many wrong finesses|pg||
nt|dinos1: who 6@c? guess W|pg||
nt|szalay: easy 4@S now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only lead says 10 or more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of rebidding 1N with 4@S   make sure your partnership has agreement about priority over checkback when holding BOTH 3-fit and 4 other major|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not rusnow|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|phil: trump Q? or "where's your void"?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most common agreement -- 1st priority= show fit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|ady: yes  maybe defence will switch to a club|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how one find SD here @D lead is perfect but.....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next thing for partnership --  do you just respond shape or do you clarify min/max|pg||
nt|joest:  i think that depends on whether the checkback can be game invitational or whether it is known to be a game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here, 2@H alert says  3@H, maybe 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: if North's stray queen were in diamonds and not spades, you might go down in two|pg||
nt|bigtrain: standard  (A from AK) leads|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, they bid drury, so there was a chance|pg||
pc|d9|nt|barnets: for me , i think zia misbid|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is not easy on a new partnership, but problem avoided|pg||
nt|dinos1: hmm - 6@h is @c void? or what?|pg||
nt|barnets: and 6@C asked for trump Q|pg||
nt|tez: 6@c means..i have not idea your 5nt bid..pls help:)|pg||
nt|joest:  Katz trying to drag a diamond cue out of Nickell|pg||
nt|joest:  if this is not the worst 13 count in the world, it is close.  I guess it does have an ace in it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: absolutely essential to clarify if 1-way checkback   optional if 2-way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: better meld if @DJ rather than @SJ   [pinochle reference]|pg||
nt|joest:  opposite some folks Katz might actually let his partner out short of slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N probably says  bad hand   so not sure if obligated to cue @DA now|pg||
nt|joest:  but Nickell is conservative enough that my guess is it won't matter much what Nick does|pg||
nt|joest:  katz is headed to six|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think Jack -- is 4@D obligatory on the given auction?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  28  Zagorin did open 2@D    and Bathurst also led @S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|phil: if 6@c asked for void, then low = 1st I'd bet|pg||
nt|barnets: but maybe if he bid responded corectly |pg||
nt|dinos1: mb theyresponse by steps|pg||
nt|joest:  one kibitzer points out that a slow 4@h here creats problems of its own|pg||
nt|bigtrain: UNLESS they have promised length in the suit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest:  and to answer your question Al, I am not sure that I must cue-bid a diamond control here but I would|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe can fool them to throw (what) on all the @cs|pg||
nt|warrens:  maybe a fast hand?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how he concluded that i do not know|pg||
pc|c4|nt|grebrof: doesnt look like it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or deducted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of [many] differences with expert partnerships is discussion of when player MUST cue below game versus when allowed to bypass with bad hand|pg||
nt|joest:  3Nt was such a negative expresson one round ago that yes I would own up to the @d ace|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: now in easy street|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reverse  pauses     slow = discouraging|pg||
nt|joest:  i am not sure what is going on but worse...|pg||
nt|joest:  i'm not sure Katz and Nickell are sure either|pg||
nt|joest:  I know that I would take no action as east that would suggest I have four clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nickell wrote down something, but his handwriting is tiny and I can't read it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure -- blame his handwriting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm looking at his hand and still can't figure out 6@C|pg||
nt|joest:  Katz can surely picture hands where the hearts will provide a critical pitch in either diamonds or spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe  @D control but not 2nd round @C or @S|pg||
nt|joest:  this is the worst of the three possible slams (6@c, 6@h 6NT)|pg||
nt|joest:  it has one further huge demerit|pg||
nt|joest:  it goes down|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|warrens:  come on Michael, claim for once in your life|pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|grebrof: I recommend his book thou |pg||
nt|barnets: 6@C asked for void|pg||
nt|barnets: and 6@H showed a vod diamond|pg||
nt|phil: maybe those hours in partnership bidding rooms paid off....|pg||
nt|barnets: that would be in a perfect world|pg||
nt|tez: well bid|pg||
nt|joest:  eric kokish, bidding theorist par excellence has a suggestion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kokes is koach of Nickell partnership & team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Katz says Nickell must have a lot of queens, thought he had 4324 shape|pg||
nt|joest:  he proposed (if I have this right) that a 2Nt rebid in response to 2@@d|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzff: some people believe in making the opponents use energy whenever possible|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|joest:  2@d is either 4333 or 3334 so that 2@h (the call NIckell chose) would always show a ruffing value, and hence a fourth club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Also said before the dummy went down he apologizes if Nickell is 4333 shape|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest:  simple but effective and would come to grips with the primary problem eastwest did not cope with here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: Louk raises his eyebrows.  "Really, he didn't have it..."|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: Questions all around.  Louk can have four spades, but usually five.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he got it right so meck 3N+2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 55-7 set for Nickell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Confirming that the first double was indeed 5-7 (a somewhat bleak view of two aces and a queen).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: More talking, nodding, now Bobby starts studying his hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did anyone explain Ricco's bidding??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: I would bet that he missed an ace.  Could of course be wrong :).|pg||

nt|odysseus70: Zia nartel bid 6 clubs where 5C here|pg||
nt|joest:  in the meantime, both 6@h and 6NT looked cold to me so this is a major reversal of fortune|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who just woke up bridgewise   Eric Kokish is member of BOTH   ACBL and Canadian Hall of Fame|pg||
nt|joest:  and deservedly so|pg||
nt|joest:  Anything Eric has to say about bidding is worth listening|pg||
nt|joest:  listening to|pg||
nt|joest:  [although I don't rebid three card suits as often as he would like I'm sure]|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 'never say never' :)|pg||
nt|ady: easy 6NT for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I remember he could have taken an ace and didnt, so he has lost his mind too, but they claimed 9, so....|pg||
nt|phil: claim was +600 - quite possible there was a collective Sominex coup|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like they bid perfectly, no confusion on their part|pg||
nt|jaapfr: deduced is the correct English?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Well, Bobby Levin was the Youngest Life Master ever at the ACBL for a long time, at the age of 17 in 1973|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest:  so what would you bid with Katz' hand al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and he hates having the 2@C-2@D//2@H convention called Kokish  [in original writeup he called it  "Birthright"]|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest:  that is a battle that Eric has lost however|pg||
mb|1N|an|Around 10 with stopper and balanced|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if in use as natural invite if hand is worth 1@H-3@D |pg||
nt|joest:  at this point Katz with nothing left to do but boost to 4@h on his stiff heart|pg||
nt|joest:  i don't know.  That is a simple and effective method, particularly for casual partnerships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so much so that most don't even realize there IS a battle :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1nt is gf |pg||
nt|warrens:  this makes 6@C, but needs 3-2 trumps and favorable @S's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: assuming NS don't get into auction  -- what is your rebid plan after  1@H-1N//2@C or 2@H   [if it changes when 1N not forcing please clarify]|pg||
mb|2S|nt|reisig: That was the "REAL" lead??|pg||
nt|grebrof: we havent had one partscore making enough tricks for game yet at this table, so they are more afraid of losing a game than bidding too hard at least|pg||
nt|odysseus70: hopeless 4H|pg||
nt|joest:  did 3@c show spades on the side?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 3@C was just pre-emptive|pg||
nt|joest:  3@s clearlysome sort of 'fit showing' then|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  since he will be on lead against 4@h|pg||
nt|dburn: to an extent, so does 3NT by East|pg||
mb|2N|nt|odysseus70: great stop|pg||
nt|szalay: maybe P-P-X-all pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: yes for a new partnership good stuff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: He was on the USA team with Meckwell that won in the early 80s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tez: best lead|pg||
nt|reisig: I love tight matches :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@D would have shown a club void|pg||
nt|szalay: 1981|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 7 spades wrecked by the 5-2 split|pg||

nt|jaapfr: imo W afraid for another set of half psychish bids NS|pg||
nt|joest:  ok this makes much more sense :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: with 3 cards in Ps suit and one sure entry, it looks strange for some - maybe he wants 2 off?|pg||
nt|ady: need control asking bid with hearts agreed to find queen missing|pg||
nt|ady: 11 imps to Fleisher  on hand 28   got to 3NT and make 10 tricks    north raised south overcall of 1NT to 2NT|pg||
nt|clinch: Unfortunately don't know what the EW bidding shows or asks here.... 2@c obviously asking, but not clear after that|pg||
nt|ady: some would bid 2NT with east hand first re-bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Thank goodness for Al Hollander! 2@c= puppet to 2@d, 2@d denied some specific hands, 2NT confirmed 2@c natural and forcing|pg||
nt|szalay: no doubt Drijver's options are pass or dbl|pg||

nt|phil: I mean, who leads a spade from four with three of partner's suit? |pg||

mb|2S|nt|grebrof: about the @s lead - we all get inspired at times + it earned an IMP, so....|pg||
nt|phil: there's two ways to play here - one is the 'old way' which x is hearts and 1S is a takeout. The newer way is double is takeout of  spades and 1S is Michaels|pg||

nt|grebrof: I think W has a nice hand when P can raise to 2|pg||
nt|phil: this looks impossible even if he gets clubs right|pg||
nt|phil: he does know the major shapes of NS - he does not know the minors|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think S comes under pressure on the run of the clubs|pg||

pc|d4|nt|joest:  two spades + 2 hearts + three diamonds + 2 clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H -1 was a push   no surprise|pg||
nt|dburn: @s9 may be reverse suit preference for diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: 10 IMPs on 446 when the Dutch climbed to 4NT, and despite playing from the right side, didn't make it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: at first glance|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|clinch: reasonably enough will play for spade to be right|pg||
nt|ady: only chance  stiff king of clubs|pg||
nt|clinch: so even more now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: correct me if i am wrong|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|odysseus70: i spoke too soon|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|clinch: In the other room, they've reached 3NT by S on the A@s lead....not a successful lead|pg||
nt|ady: may make   could be another swing for Fleisher|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|tez: specs pls join us:)|pg||
nt|barnets: next board the last of set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably J rather than 8 |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|reisig: He's just cashing ..before a @s back|pg||
nt|barnets: an exciting match|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barnets: 1 more quarter to go|pg||
nt|dinos1: A, then @s after fat @s signal|pg||
nt|reisig: @d ace ..or I'll be amazed|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|reisig: -100 EW|pg||
nt|reisig: not a great swing :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 4 will be margin|pg||

nt|reisig: or ...2 more :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: at least 1 more|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: oh  but other room was 6@H -1   i forgot here 6@C :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|warrens:  once he sees the @C position, declarer will be very unhappy|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that 4nt-1 must be a misclick|pg||

nt|phil: Monaco is in to the round of 8 - Berg WD's after 3|pg||
nt|tez: neck and neck last round|pg||
nt|odysseus70: hard for declarer to believe East had so much|pg||
nt|jaapfr: new leader|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rodwell led @D - misguessed  J won  then couldn't handle 41 trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I don't have control of that table|pg||
nt|dburn: why must it? 4NT won't make without a heart lead from the king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Last board here. Thanks all. We shall resume shortly (hopefully)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: last hand of the session|pg||
nt|tez: we are here|pg||
nt|reisig: 3N is normal ..just doesn't make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Chris: good match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Peter Don and sspecks|pg||
nt|barnets: close 3n|pg||
nt|odysseus70: last board of a close encounter-|pg||
nt|joest:  ic, yes the diamond hook (of the queen) was part of the successful route to 12 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Here you can't make 4@S legitimately, but it's a tough defence|pg||
nt|phil: big board for Zia / Chip here|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1 partscore and the other 15 are games bid - not all made - thats teams all right|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have 4 losers in hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|clinch: Match nicely evened up again thanks to the imaginative lead on 31 in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  do well in diamonds   10 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: but easy to see how the defense can stub its toe - it almost happened in the OR|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last board of a very fine session|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|ady: 2@S shows spades and diamonds I am informed|pg||
nt|ady: yet west supports spades   maybe thinks AX enough|pg||
nt|tez: 3@c asking 5 card major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and tx Chase for your very fine job|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and szalay and avril for your commentating|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Thank you.  The 2nd quarter will be up very shortly after this board, please come back!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he tried to play N for endplay in @S IF N had @SJxxxx|pg||
pc|c9|nt|odysseus70: this time game is very good and they should get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H, 1N or .... for you Jack|pg||
nt|joest:  i don't think Nickell is reopening |pg||
pc|cA|nt|grebrof: dbl +4 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H too high    but will east defend|pg||
nt|joest:  i don't mind 1NT actually|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|joest:  as long asyou don't mind looking foolish now and then :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would have bid 1N  but wouldn't have loved it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Verhees forgot that is natural over 3rd seat opener :)|pg||
nt|joest:  Verhees has his work cut out for him|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|phil: not 4-5 spades? |pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl 3@s|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, 4-5|pg||
nt|phil: yeah|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You need a diamond ruff as your 10th trick, so you must hope to sneak a trump through West|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h is contract also in open room|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and lbnl tx all for your fine tips ideas info and help kibs|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all|pg||
pc|s3|nt|clinch: Also by N|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  well down if defence taps declarer|pg||
nt|phil: 3@d simply denies one - it DOES NOT promise a four card major like regular puppet|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2:  Which Martel did in the open room|pg||
nt|reisig: OOOPS|pg||
nt|tez: equal..1 down|pg||
nt|phil: wow - big tempo lost here|pg||
nt|barnets: must shift heart now|pg||
nt|dinos1: lost tempo to set @d's|pg||
nt|barnets: or it makes|pg||
nt|joest:  i think he can do it if he works clubs with this entry|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|phil: you can reverse the dummy somewhat but the wrong hand has the 4th club|pg||
nt|ady: 14 imps to Fleisher on 31   made 3NT   when down 3 here|pg||
nt|clinch: Will need to find @s switch sometime here...will test EW signalling|pg||
nt|ady: great recovery by Fleisher   in the lead  and may gain on this hand|pg||
nt|clinch: Though as Victor Silverstone points out, the 3@s bid makes it easier :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not tough to make this 4@H imo|pg||
pc|s7|nt|reisig: shift to left foot ...still makes|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h shift wont help|pg||
nt|barnets: why ?|pg||
nt|phil: and duck a heart as well - the level of difficulty just went up a few notches|pg||
nt|dinos1: coz u cant open this suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: always make 4@S as EW?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|grebrof: now one match is live at http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|barnets: well I play a heart and duck it|pg||
nt|phil: yeah but two heart tricks does him no good|pg||
nt|reisig: @d was good ..just ONE trick late :)|pg||
nt|barnets: and try and make 2 hearts and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|phil: two heart tricks....for declarer (to specs)|pg||
nt|barnets: does that work ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am not so sure but anyway a good safe\|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: East cant see the the long clubs  as we can|pg||
nt|jaapfr: V-NV:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: loving any action with south hand is an overbid|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: what a sneaky way to make 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|phil: the theme is "play the suit you do not want the opponents playing"|pg||
nt|odysseus70: very solid finish on last 3 boards makes it difficult to see how Rosenthal can win|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|phil: maybe Zia is rubbing off on him :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: not @c?|pg||
nt|joest:  did Nickell really play the spade queen?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Good luck to all in the 4th quarter|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: 8@D  told the story|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: new leader now|pg||
nt|barnets: tx all specs must go now|pg||
nt|reisig: Thx Barnet!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|phil: the spade at T2 is so sexy....|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Spade and a test for Willenken|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y but must find @C 3-3 AND @SQ!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: night bye all|pg||
pc|c5|nt|clinch: Switch not found in open room|pg||
nt|ady: another swing?|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|odysseus70: problems about how to play this- worries abot 4-1 hearts and d ruffs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final board of the 1st half|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus70: lack of entries suggests that right play was ace and another heart-however no way to go down as cards lie|pg||
nt|odysseus70: this extra entry gives options with hearts -can play queen to guard against K10xx with South -losing to bare king with North-that looks right|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: does not work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about 70 minutes before Q3    expect 2 closest matches on vugraph|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: is in fact @SJ even sneakier (in stead of the 9)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ?|pg||
nt|tez: well played.i cant say any for defence:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Now it's becoming too obvious I think|pg||
nt|ady: already 25 imps recently   so will be over 30|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|ady: another 11|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hard to imagine NOT having our match again for 2nd half, but the other 2 matches were relatively close after Q1|pg||
pc|h9|nt|odysseus70: 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|phil: looks like he is trying the 'legitimate' line|pg||
nt|odysseus70: thx all|pg||
