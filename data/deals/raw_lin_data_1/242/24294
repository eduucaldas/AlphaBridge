mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
mb|2S|an|alert|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
mb|2N|an|alert|mb|p|mb|3C|an|alert|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||

mb|4D|nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this will take a lot of good guessing to make|pg||
mb|4N|nt|phil: Rosenberg ducked, diamond returned...not that anything really matters on this layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
mb|6N|nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||

nt|xenya: can get out for -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and he is likely to get spades right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||

nt|kit: Zia has chosen to not play spades and hope the opponents have to break the suit.  But I don't think they will have to do so.|pg||
nt|3for3: cant he ruff this and exit heart?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I guess he can -- or ruff this, ruff heart, exit with diamond|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: levin says "we should just play open notes"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hello. only score is accurate cos we started late|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
mb|1C|nt|phil: so what to open on an 8-4 :)? |pg||
mb|1H|nt|phil: you don't see these hands in textbooks|pg||
mb|1S|an|denies 4+!S|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Zimmerman had to be tempted to bid 6@d here|pg||
nt|phil: it cant be that expensive, and who knows who makes what? |pg||
nt|phil: yet, partner's 5@d made them guess|pg||
nt|phil: maybe East should x 5@h?  he has some surprise defense|pg||
nt|phil: although I'm not really clear what a w/w 5m opening is supposed to show|pg||
nt|phil: but definitely not KQTx in a side major :)|pg||
nt|phil: NS appear to have four losers, but it seems like they would have a hard time taking all four|pg||
nt|phil: give east Axxx of clubs, and 6@d actually makes - but so does 6M (probably)|pg||
mb|d|an|alert|nt|fabsayc: do we know what fleischer's double shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
nt|phil: this will compress one of the losers|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think Martel will just come back a spade -- bigger danger declarer has ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just penalty worth hand|pg||
nt|ritong: your lead, michael|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fell asleep|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: must've not caught the 1@S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: zimmerman double was either brave or foolhardy|pg||
nt|ritong: a small swing to fleisher, presumably|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: south might pass other room, 1NT west swish  @s lead 90|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|kit: wrong again|pg||
nt|phil: so an undoubled vulnerable save against a making 5@d'|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|3for3: even playing 0/2 leads, wouldn't know if his honor was Q or K|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||

nt|phil: oh|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, 6@d is definitely possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: against a very weak nt, after norths double transfer bids by south give more options|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|3for3: ew might sniff around at slam here|pg||
nt|phil: I like 1@d. I loathe 2N|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he was afraid of pushing NS to a makeable slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi again|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: as I said before you arrived - Multon's 5@d have his opps a tough guess - and they might have guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|phil: *gave|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: They have a lot of high cards for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *just -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if Kamil bid 5@d (and why shouldn't he?) the spades would have been buried|pg||
nt|phil: now Zimmerman can pattern out|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: they like their 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will keep them out of any slam|pg||
mb|4H|nt|3for3: true, but from helgemo's POV cant east hace a stiff club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he though partner had heart support I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 5@H was a bold bid, in the jaws of unfavourable vulnurability |pg||
nt|phil: yeah - along with some nice defense too|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: solo|pg||
nt|xenya: all in all well done by both sides on the last hand|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|phil: 4@h does not handle well|pg||
nt|phil: he's tapped down to parity at T1|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike 4@S?|pg||
nt|phil: if hearts break OK, he can manage 4H + 5S + 1C and doesn't need the club hook|pg||
nt|phil: in spades can't you take 5S in hand, 3 ruffs in dummy plus two aces? |pg||
nt|xenya: unless they lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: in the other room, N didn't get in -- still, S found a @C lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: he can, but even then there might not be 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|phil: yes that may cause difficulties - but maybe declarer can make something out of the heart suit then|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|3for3: q of clubs was the q of hearts, and slam is laydown|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|kit: I don't really see What Helgemo can bid but 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are in sync with open room, almost equivalent auctions|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe 5@S, focusing attention on club control at the slight risk of going down there.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|phil: so there may be some counters - hard to say who comes out on top|pg||
nt|phil: but overall 4@s looks worlds better than 4@h|pg||
nt|phil: ruffing looks a little better here - the diamond suit is tied up if he does|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: in reality, zia passed the 12 count as east, south opened 1NT, was left there and apprently made 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|xenya: in any case, i wholly agree with what you said about the 2N bid, Phil -- E's hand just doesn't qualify|pg||
pc|s3|nt|phil: but if he draws the last trump, what does he pitch from dummy? |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|phil: now the hand falls apart|pg||

nt|3for3: the danger of 3d round overruff if partner has xx of clubs and no jack of spades is quite real tho|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzfv: no superfluous conversation in this room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all very focused|pg||
nt|phil: in the other room in 4@s, declarer started to finesse in clubs, and then chickened out - South ruffed, returned a trump, and that was that|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@S in the other room, Rosenberg opted for a very unfortunate line|pg||
nt|phil: but he will be pleased to learn he won 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|osvaill83: undo|pg||
nt|3for3: missing a pass|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry Phil :)|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: 3N is excellent NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many possible bids by south|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kit: I agree -- that's why I think he has to just bid 4@S and hope that if East has a stiff club he can make a move.|pg||
nt|phil: but 3@h is in 800 country|pg||
nt|xenya: yeah|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: both 3NT and 5@d make here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C by helness?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|phil: wow Multon doesn't even consider 4@c|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT having the advantage to score 630 if they do not cash @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wow, this works but is risking missing a game|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzfv: hmm not sure if 2h or 2c should be alerted as garbage stayman. just happy i made out what she wrote.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that Kx looks very bad for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N is not concerned about hearts here, rather about the quality of the 1D suit|pg||
mb|3S|an|asks for 3+!S with an honor|nt|fabsayc: just a spade doubleton and some aces|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some confusion over the x? |pg||
nt|phil: double these days generally means anything but penalty|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s= " i need help in that suit buddy"|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: a variation of 5 card stayman|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny says "i dont have much help" as she laid downdumy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 4@c= "get lost"|pg||
nt|ritong: or something like that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a "buddy" bid|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: but molson says "you have trumps!"|pg||
nt|phil: well thats sad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: double was a @H stopper ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Declarer has problems here.  Even with the clubs coming in, there are only 8 winners.|pg||
nt|phil: and 3N must have meant a partial stopper|pg||
nt|phil: so he wasn't far off|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: so why 5@d??|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: french word is " coopératif"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or we use to call it a west coast cue bid (asking for half stopper)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|xenya: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|3for3: quite thin game.  needs clubs to behave, 44 diamonds for starters|pg||
nt|3for3: and 9th trick to come from spades.|pg||
nt|grebrof: !k and switch to @ds?|pg||
nt|grebrof: @H K|pg||
nt|kit: If East does shift to king of hearts, declarer will definitely win the trick|pg||
nt|kit: Since he is looking at down 1 if he ducks.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes. but it will make the defense easy|pg||

mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|phil: I wonder how they'd show a constructive raise then? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: they possibly could, but I'm unsure|pg||
nt|phil: no worries|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I thought NS played Flannery....I'm confused now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think, multi|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
nt|phil: kind of a wacky multi opener red/white - maybe trying to create a little early action|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzfv: the "lost track" part may occur a lot, unfortunately, as these ladies at times play with supersonic gusto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thinking|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is generally 'transfer me' and 4@d is 'you bid it' - which Kamil will do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it will work out|pg||
nt|phil: looks like he wanted to protect any diamond cards in Marty's hand|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman has the world's fair on this auction|pg||
nt|phil: now - Zimmerman should be less excited about playing hearts now|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d advertises length in both|pg||
nt|xenya: if he bids 4@H, he will make it|pg||
nt|phil: NS can make a lot of sapdes however|pg||
nt|phil: I think they bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: assuming it gets passed out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Zimmermann in the tank. |pg||
nt|phil: 4@h is a little awkward to play - but I think South has the option of losing one of his trump tricks or allowing the diamond pitch to be taken, right? |pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C doesn't look too bad either -- until you see the whole layout|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, hearts that are "Hawaii" (5-0) is very bad for both|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps just an interesting, how do you stop 4@s? |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Interesting -- so Zia didn't work out that West could dodge the end-play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helgemo embarassed he threw his @H away|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|phil: I would take dbl of 4@d as 'cards' and a subsequent x of 4@s as penalty|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: now 5NT or 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades are shakey, i think 4 enough|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D seems a tad conservative with that fine 46|pg||
nt|phil: Multon not excited about defending 4@s with his paucity of defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: action!|pg||
nt|phil: aieee|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder Zimmermann was in the tank -- the whole auction looks crazy, from his perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all purpose DSI double (do something intelligent)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H seems right for north on that basis|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: he might be afraid North has just hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: no oops here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the downside of the upgrading craze occurs on hands like this|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: well 3 is down a lot but a deep position|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, imps do not grow on trees|pg||
nt|ritong: down 40 or so|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: with 12 boards to go...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny has to use the restroom. the rest are waiting for her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson left with her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers started reading the newspaper|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: real news, not bridge news. hope she doesn't get distracted by all the crazy stuff happening today :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually i think she's doing the puzzles. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson seems a very friendly chatty person. she's back now.|pg||
nt|kit: now this bid I don't understand -- seems like clear 3NT call by Zia|pg||
nt|xenya: N might pass  now?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|3for3: well, north is a PH, so with just hearts he can just bid them, either a weak 2, or 2@H at second turn|pg||
nt|phil: Lightner from Fleisher now? |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: granted this is not a normal situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in that case why not 3nt by rosenberg|pg||
pc|c2|nt|phil: a quick -2|pg||
nt|phil: Kamil will also rip 6@h|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: good point Danny -- I forgot about initial pass|pg||
pc|c6|nt|grebrof: what to bid than 2@d?|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil knows Fleisher is ruffing the heart, so his lead is suit preference|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: So here we have another close 3NT contract|pg||
nt|3for3: entry problems for the 9th trick, even if the clubs are 33.|pg||
nt|phil: don't they lose a diamond too? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ending in 2nt has no upside|pg||
nt|ritong: are you absolutely sure to want to lecture rosenberg about imps tactics?:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: i always bid 6nt if close|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and here danger of a bad spade break makes 6nt my choice|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|grebrof: @d to 10?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i do think if your going to swing you need to start early, and 3nt is the best contract for that tactic|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ok|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: they are guessing contract in our room (with no success)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: might ruff honor, and finesse the J@S?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: @Cs offer a better chance|pg||
nt|kit: if clubs 3-3, opponents can't cash 4 tricks |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 3 off -- there's a @D to lose as well|pg||
pc|s8|nt|grebrof: the 3 wins, npp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: it was correct|pg||
nt|kit: East didn't squander 8 of clubs on 2nd round of clubs|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: almost certainly|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: I assume this is operator error with the club spots|pg||
nt|grebrof: for me, the operator is god - I dont know what happened :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, after the 2@C fuss, i might have gotten lost|pg||
nt|pelu:  for sure @c 10 8 left in East|pg||
nt|grebrof: Helness in the tank now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: he 100% led the 2@C|pg||

nt|phil: in old KS, an early weak NT system, 3@s showed a powerhouse|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|medwards: mildred is a very nice lady. she many good stories from the old days|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we'll make sure to ask her about the good ole days then :)|pg||
nt|medwards: ask hr about first acbl conv cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this looks good for EW, no? i can see a small gain?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|grebrof: bidding a stretchy 3nt nonvul is more or less what they have so far|pg||
nt|3for3: he hasnt made this yet.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|phil: but their 1m openings were fairly beefy too|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: diamond discard?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: nah after patapon won the CA. next trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suppose it is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: diamond from dummy :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfv: quite a few zzz kibitzers kibbing this table. zzz used to be those who logged in anonymously to kib|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but nowadays its likely to be bboers kibbing via their mobile apps. smartphones, tablets :)|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, now he is home|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: rosenberg has shown the @h singleton|pg||

nt|fabsayc: smooth duck by val would have made hand impossible to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she said "diamond" (so must be small diamond from the 2 in dummy). but then she claimed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when diamond to queen|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they had one board unlucky like this at two different boards, they would be down more, so lucky deal still this|pg||
mb|1S|nt|3for3: I am off, thx to all spex, and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree about the trump echo, not sure spade jack said anything though|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 4@s does not look cold|pg||
mb|3N!|an|4+!S, unspecified mini-splinter|mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfv: if you have a smartphone or tablet, you can get the bbo app free from the appstores|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: other room passed this one out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Roland tells me a @h lead gave away the contract in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: 35-17 Fleisher this segment -- the gap has narrowed down a little but is still quite big|pg||
nt|phil: Axx + Axx does not want to declarer the NT|pg||
mb|5H|nt|osvaill83: and theres more to come :)|pg||
nt|phil: but if they play 2@s promises 6 - there's little option|pg||
mb|p|nt|medwards: must not play 3rd seet forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 3N by North looks pretty good to me|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ritong: according to 1930's authors, noone has an opening here|pg||
mb|5S|nt|fabsayc: actually culbertson would open south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: even after the double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nm|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious pass and pull|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: When South shows up with stiff heart, declarer won't misguess the diamonds|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has to have a stiff|pg||
nt|grebrof: or void|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but declarer won't be playing North for AJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil can likely count on 6-4 on left - with a 5-5, he'd Michaels (or whatever they play to show H + C)|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I think you are right|pg||
nt|grebrof: just saying|pg||
nt|ritong: also, fantunes play 1X openings differently|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: and maybe fulvio did not feel like opening south 1Nt|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|medwards: heart lead would cause problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: there's a stopclock in the room counting down available time. only 17 min left to play|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ritong: was the right move, though|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i saw at least 6 boards in this set where the trailing side could generate reasonable large swings|pg||
pc|sA|nt|phil: that double gave away some gratuitous information|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards so quickly, sometimes i can't catch his spots|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: down now|pg||
nt|phil: when dummy gets tapped he cannot avoid a loss of four tricks that I can see|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told that a ruling is possible on board 18 -- seems there was a wrong explanation by H-H in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: deciding between club and diamond|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzfv: but only this + 1 other board so they should be fine.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: and yep this board likely to increase westheimer's lead i think :)|pg||
nt|phil: I think he can lead his shoe and its down|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|fabsayc: last board of this set, thanks to our operator Kendrick, tough job if players dont cooperate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: my pleasure, sorry about some missed action. |pg||
mb|1D|nt|phil: and partially to NS's system that doesn't allow North to play 3N :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: packing things up|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Fleisher has made some very quirky preempts immediately after bad boards this set|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: and congratulations to westheimer for a well deserved win, they played very solidly in every match|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: 2c is something that i couldnt hear|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is quirky²|pg||
nt|xenya: and this one might make things tough for EW?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: packing their things during zimmermann's tank|pg||
nt|phil: is quirky squared "quarky"? |pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: that introduces too much physics into bridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|phil: heh|pg||
nt|ritong: well we didn t mention black holes yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann floats the pass card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to my cocommentator Henri, and everybody else that makes this all possible and enjoyable|pg||
nt|ritong: pleased to be your coco|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the alert means not bid on total junk|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: next set should starts 10-15 after both vugraphs go down|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s bid with extras...hmm|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfv: these women must play each other a lot. they talk in nods and meaningful glances. |pg||
nt|grebrof: http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|phil: I have one between my ears|pg||
nt|ritong: extras, yes  4@s bid, debatable|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a very old american treatment|pg||
mb|1N|nt|phil: Zimmerman conducting a pass and pull sequence? I play 3@d as GF - wonder if they do too?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i have often felt like i fell into one at the slower vugraph tables...|pg||
nt|ritong: he will bid 4@s imo|pg||
nt|ritong: my point is 5332 is not superincentive|pg||
nt|ritong: i would quietly single raise and await|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: this is last of 4 sessions, so I dont think Fleisher has given up yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *first|pg||
nt|grebrof: first, sorry :D|pg||
nt|ritong: pass and cue|pg||
nt|phil: surprised he didn't bd 4@s initially|pg||
nt|ritong: even stronger than pass and pull:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or pass the double|pg||
nt|phil: that shows a moose |pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
nt|phil: I count 5 for NS|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: now that's a cue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S would be without the club king|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: pass and jump cue|pg||
nt|phil: whatever 5@s shows - he doesn't have it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|phil: with Multon's I would want to bid 8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks again Kendrick and Henri|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I need a coffee - my screen is not often this blue :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  spec tx to our opereator u hacve done a superb job - spec with all the informations from the table TX!|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: ty ty see all later|pg||
nt|grebrof: its just as good as 4@s - choice of slam with a void - I have everything|pg||
nt|psyck: is that the strongest bid ever made?|pg||
nt|ritong: might be|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe this will scare off a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: thanks for watching this segment and bearing with me. |pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfv: doesnt look like this has a chance :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bye for now|pg||

nt|Walddk4: He has not made it yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one told him that spades are 8-1|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess is he will duplicate rosenberg's line|pg||
nt|phil: some perceptive commentators tell me 7N makes |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: multon asks if double is 100% penalty, fleisher, does an air "knock-on-wood"|pg||
