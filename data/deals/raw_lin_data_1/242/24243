mb|3H|nt|bigtrain: i hear you john|pg||

nt|bigtrain: i'll guess 4S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kit: sort of optimistic, since even opposite a 5-count might not have much play|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't need much|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Smith in 4@H East|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge responded 1N with south hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 4@S in other room, but less known about EW cards|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: this will probably depend on the heart suit|pg||
nt|kit: this will depend upon which heart finesse he takes with his one dummy entry -- I imagine he will get it right due to the overcall|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meck: carding? Lilienstein: standard|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohler opened 15-17 NT  Berkowitz made conventional RDBL but never got chance to show @H|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: maybe the 2@C overcall will influence that|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|bigtrain: certanly east's initial pass will come into play|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: Also East is passed hand, and has shown both black kings, so add in king of hearts and a diamond honor and he would be close to an opening bid|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+S limited to 15 |pg||
nt|bigtrain: you have 9/15 points in your 2 doubletons|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 9/16 (more than half)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Glubok opened 1@D  playing 4@S south|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 4@S = anything that wants to play game since the initial 1@S is limited|pg||
nt|kit: likely trump lead, with all else dangerous|pg||
nt|bigtrain: feels like the @HK is enticing him|pg||
mb|3D|an|spade slam try|nt|kit: this I don't like -- and it will cost him big time|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D is an ART slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is 3@D general slam try in @S or always balanced?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d presumably a help suit kind of bid & with a doubleton & 4th trump, W accepts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: free Q finesse and two diamonds away|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- a second trump trick plus the timing for more ruffs, gets declarer up to 10 tricks I believe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the rest are Q-bids|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ART = artificial|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bigtrain: doesn't look like 10 to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: watch multiple tables without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  [that also gives access to voice]|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT is serious which will propel roddy to slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: seems like only 9|pg||
nt|kit: did I miscount?  maybe I did|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|kit: you are right -- he is still a trick short.  Too early in the morning|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence will now play ace and a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: West should have count on the hand now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell show both 1st and 2nd round controls up-the-line|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@S = 2+Q|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: from the bidding meck knows they re off the @DK so i'm surrised about 5NT inviting slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: all the Qbids are controls |pg||
mb|6D|nt|bigtrain: grand slam - yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|bigtrain: 5NT asks   of kings|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is @D shift really best now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: can S set up a long heart? East has discarded one - not sure if there are enough entries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Wooldrige asking Rodwell questions|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he can't have 2 kings guys|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he DENIED a @D control|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: i know   @D2 was just a suggestion|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and i said it was a mistake imo|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not enough schlitz here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: maybe @D shift was best   i didn't pay attention to @C spots|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: shouldn't help -- runs short on trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: but will Lev read @Cdoubleton? |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i also missed @C discard|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious hand - maybe discarding two hearts on the @cAQ would have been better, as @DJ is onside|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: no mistakes by defense after the missed opening lead, so down 1|pg||
mc|12|nt|bigtrain: general speaking john...  grand is best to bid needing at worst  a 3-2 break in your opinion?|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|xenya: so 2 thin 4@S contracts bid and made in both rooms -- exciting start to the match|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|d7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|s8|nt|xenya: a solid 3N -- but some would prefer to be in 6@C here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: but they were aware of the misfits i think, so stopping short of slam of slam looks reasonable|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|oosmanb: I dont know how good 6@c is. even with @c 2-2, you need the @D finesse? |pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|bigtrain: i think that is the winning line mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meckwell discussing auction and options, conclude with "we'll go over that later"|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: but discarding the diamonds looked a normal enough thing to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: In the other room, Martel bid 3@h instead of 3@d, & playing there|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: it would be pretty double-dummy, as crossruff line works when trumps split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sound opening 2 bids :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed - so easy when you can see all the cards|pg||
nt|bigtrain: didn't say it was right...  just winning :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: down 33 things change :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: what does Glubok bid now?|pg||
nt|kit: even then not so easy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psyck: Their 1@h must be pretty sound if this is a fav vul 2@h for them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well --- i didn't expect 2@C from Woolsey|pg||
nt|kit: possible 6@C here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possible 6@c here EW|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: I prefer a splinter 3@H with West hand -- as long as you are raising, why not describe?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg:  welcome Martin and Joe :) i'll be watching you from voice|pg||
pc|c6|nt|clinch: Well now NS are California, EW NY - ahe bidding looks a bit better :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hedy suggests their 2@h may be an intermediate hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  50  2@S made in other room|pg||
nt|kit: Now he splinters -- seems like a strange order to do things|pg||
nt|kit: lucky to get the chance when East happened to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|kit: But now have to start the slam exploration a level higher|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: sorry  down in other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this side of the pond 2@c doesn't promise the earth, so 3@h would be aggressive with poorish spades |pg||
nt|kit: some say that maybe 3@H wouldn't have been a splinter in their methods -- certainly possible|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the problem is that RKC is too high now |pg||
nt|bigtrain: or at least it may be|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: I don't understand the logic of the double of 4@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hello again |pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfc: Hi Jow, Martin and Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Joe :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: in the past meck has been heard to say there are to forms of bridge...  favorable and otherwise|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West can redouble |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 w/othe queen forces a poor slam then|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like it just gives the opponents more room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|clinch: hi Krishna|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, that's assuming 4@H is a splinter -- it might have been RKC|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: well they found 4@S    please don't ask me how|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: chicagoans know 2 seasons   winter and  under-repair|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: Whatever it all meant, East did drive to slam|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Slam far from cold, but cards lie favorable and I think any reasonable line of play will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: under construction just sounds too positive|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|clinch: Innocuos board to start - three obvious losers|pg||
pc|h6|nt|clinch: innocuous even|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: One possible danger is if declarer takes a crossruff approach, he may at the end try to get back to his hand with diamond ruff instead of spade ruff.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: Smith in 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brad Moss raised to 2@H rather than Lev's 1N|pg||
nt|kit: But declarer will probably be trying to set up spades first, and will get the news there|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: wonder if S will withhold the J|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: yes ralf|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: Now nothing can go wrong that I can see|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe North should have foreseen this problem and led 9 of clubs to protect his partner's holding.  Not at all obvious.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s8|nt|psyck: result for the 1st couple of boards we missed have been entered|pg||
nt|clinch: You might even bet that this would be identical at any table|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|oosmanb: North got off the hook|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if Lev consistent -- 1N   then what does Woolsey do?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: The bidding box on the table shows N is the dealer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  1N ended the auction|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: so the bidding starts with N opens 1@C|pg||
nt|nelson_dev: that was very nicely played|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  It would not be a good idea, in general, to have audible commentary in the room where the hands are being played.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bathroom break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: already?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: play resume|pg||

nt|odysseus70: alam|pg||
mb|4D|nt|odysseus70: makeable exremely dubious slam|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|psyck: other table reached it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe pass implies Strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: & they should here too|pg||
nt|psyck: the strongest hand is probably the last one to get into the action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: South will likely rebid @d|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|xenya: 2N looks like strongly invitational|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: @d would have been a normal lead except for the 1@d bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, so let's see - will take a bit of making|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead should get defense 2@s, 1@h , 1@c tricks|pg||
nt|kit: East has the right type of strength for double I think -- not enough for slam, but enough to expect to get more than value of game|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: other room south lead a @c after a similar auction|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, likely to play a @s to K or Q|pg||
nt|psyck: yes it should be in this seq after xx 1st|pg||
nt|kit: I like this opening lead -- who needs to lead sequences?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|nt|bigtrain: looks like 4 digits|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SQ reverse suit pref for @H  or just confirming top 3 honors??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thunderstorms rolling through here...  if i leave you'll know why :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there is little SP to the @SQ - its more informative then SP|pg||
nt|bigtrain: central ohio|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this looks like -2 to me|pg||
nt|bigtrain: SP = suit preference|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm still here...  dodging small hail now :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|clinch: Club followed by a @d may still beat it|pg||
nt|psyck: looked like max passed hand with no fit kind of bid|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 11 or 1400|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East's bidding normally indicates a pretty strong desire to defend|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|psyck: prblem with @c is that declarer may be able to set up a @c trick for @h pitch|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|xenya: so it's either 3@D or 3N -- i'm surprised at S's pass |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, we were all expecting 3@d with South's hand|pg||

mb|2C|an|5+ diamonds GF|nt|kit: which he might have done at favorable vs. strong club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: OR auction direct and to the point|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell will get to 6@H or 6NT -- doesn't want to play 6@D since king of spades would be led through|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at green, 4@h possible - at red, caution advised |pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: MUCH better Andrew|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) FG  b) 22-24 BAL|pg||
nt|kit: aha -- so how much does 6@S go for?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just what you expect when you open the North hand 1@C - at your next turn, it's up to 5@s |pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think 1700 with prefect defense|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Red vs white it seems 3 would be enough.|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 3@D is natural also|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pretty much...  just bridge mister from here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|clinch: 2@s looks makeable here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pass = forcing (usually to X)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is slightly invitational|pg||
nt|bigtrain: to 7@D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't request X|pg||
nt|kit: I guess Rodwell figures that Meck won't bid more without ace of spades and good diamonds|pg||
nt|bigtrain: although the oother hand usually does|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  10 top tricks.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that 4NT is worth discussing - natural or asking? West takes it as natural - well done |pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this a side effect of kickback|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Just 5 black suit losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge also opened 2@C  but i think his 2N rebid will be 20-21(22)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its allowed to make a descriptive bid with extra shape or values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell writes a whole paragraph on 6@H which I cannot read clearly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if S does bid 7@d (probably won't) West had better lead a spade|pg||
nt|bigtrain: at lower levels this auction would show flexible hand type|pg||
nt|kit: Clearly Meckstroth thinks Rodwell's sequence is inviting a grand|pg||

nt|xenya: declarer could afford 2nd round of trumps since even if they were 4-1, 2 rounds of diamonds would assure 10 tricks on most layouts |pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: when Woolsey was in D.C. area -- that team was killer  [3 years running they knocked my  16 seeded team out of district finals]|pg||
mb|2N|nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|kit: ugly to have to bid 2NT on a 5-5, but really no choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: is not inverted raise,|pg||
nt|kit: Now I think he has to bid an even uglier 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: expected 2NT rather than 3NT - but North would raise anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if partner has a 12-14 hand he judged 2@D safer|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I could see the 2@d bid if 1@d showed an unbalanced hand, but that certainly doesn't seem to be the case here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i picked 3@S here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|clinch: Quite close to slam here, but not quite enough maybe?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect that 1@D does however promise 4 cards|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Avoiding the 1nt response by north had the effect of right-siding the eventual nt contract (although it wouldn't seem to matter here.)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: over 2@D its tough to start 3@C|pg||
nt|kit: Will this be a hand where 4th best costs an important spot card?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that really propels the bidding too high|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but you wont be able to bid spades at all|pg||
nt|bigtrain: at least this way you got both suits in below 3NT|pg||
nt|ritong: don t think so, kit  anyways, not sure to see the point in leading 4th best in overcalled suits, at the 2 level|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: 6@c has a chance|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hands like this have me thinking attitude vs fourth|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like with hearts 3-3, ace of clubs onside, and defense unable to take more than 3 diamond tricks, that the contract will make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Vugraphzfc: Meltzer: carding? Polowan: standard, Smith, o/e discards|pg||
nt|clinch: I think 6@c thwarted as need to ruff a spade and that sets up a second trump loser|pg||
nt|psyck: no, can't ruff as u say, on red suit sqz  on W|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes that may work|pg||
nt|psyck: so 6NT would make too similarly|pg||
nt|psyck: @c lead would have taked 5@s -3, else -2, so it could have been an ok sac at this vul|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bigtrain: 3@D keeps 6@D alive|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|psyck: 6@d obviously would not|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, we'll see!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: while keeping 4@S in focus (partner can bid 3@S/3@D|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell will probably shift to a spade, necessary if declarer has better clubs and Meck has king of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: @d 2 is ominous|pg||
nt|ritong: guess they play highest from two remaining  do they, walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its expected whhen partner didn't raise at favorable|pg||
nt|ritong: that too|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: nice valuation for Woolsey to self-splinter|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  S starts out with 7 tricks and an 8th readily available in @ss, but where is the 9th coming from?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there will be 64 boards played today in this match|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: after bidding ONLY 2@S    Martel had easy cue|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: good auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think meck made the right choice|pg||
nt|kit: Will probably just blast away with spades, making 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: upcoming Spingold matches also 64 boards in 4 segments|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: interesting hand -- 4@S NS almost a make on a @H lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|clinch: Likely to play for squeeze in 6NT, as obvioosly nothing to ruff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: yes, no reason not to |pg||
nt|clinch: Some entry issues|pg||
nt|clinch: Actually, not sure squeeze works now, but could set up diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: endplay on West, perhaps|pg||

nt|psyck: yes , that works|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pretty much doesn't matter whether he cashes out or not|pg||

nt|fabsayc: we use to start with 4@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would be 4+@H  NOT normal negative dbl|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C would show the reds and 2NT would show more of the reds|pg||
nt|kit: E-W may not have agreements on meaning of double by East here|pg||
nt|kit: Could be important for him to show his spade support|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure how Martel shows 4-fit with strong NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D?|pg||
nt|kit: This could be support double -- but does West know that?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: depends on agreements|pg||
nt|ahollan1: open room just finished  48  [final board of the set]|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the so-called nebulous diamond|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: South will probably bid 4@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lilienstein: 2NT? Meck: reds|pg||
nt|kit: And now the bidding escalates|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but then, of course, i may be missing something deeper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S would just be unbal min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i'd be wrong|pg||
nt|bigtrain: when eric came up wit the idea of support X he played them through the 4-level|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no support passes only occur at the 1 and 2-level though|pg||
nt|kit: Still don't know if it was support double, as West would bid 4@S regardless with his hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the OR North bid up to 6@d all by himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C Ger....no, better not say it. Roland might be watching |pg||
mb|4S|nt|clinch: Though 3 makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: North will certainly get to 6@D -- the only question is whether he gets there fast or slowly|pg||
nt|bigtrain: walking the dog?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but the crux here is the club queen, so set that suit as trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: and is actually a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|kit: I guess it was support double (at least East thinks so), since if he hadn't shown support he would surely have bid 5@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and led ace and another heart, too - well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so maybe like Kaplan-Sheinwold   2@S = 4-fit BAL strong NT OR 4-fit unbal [so re-evaluates to extras]|pg||
nt|kit: And now the 6@D bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5nt forces to slam and invites 7 but would not help, so wests approach is practical|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however using 4@C as a slam try in clubs with a suit lacking two top is ok, since the bid has next to no use in the modern style|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E is trying to figure out what (given w's spectacularly bad @c spots) what the surest method of taking 4 @c tricks is.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess the surest method is a 3-2 break |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lilienstein takes a restroom break, came back and found that no card is played|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or maybe  low to the 9?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfc: Smith alerted 3@C but Moss did not|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||

nt|kit: South might well have doubled -- here the double won't tell declarer anything, as the 5-0 split will soon be known.|pg||
nt|kit: Not clear whether North should come back heart or diamond here -- heart may be necessary to eventually promote trump trick for South|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond may be necessary to set up partner's hypothetical king|pg||

pc|c6|nt|clinch: But here prudently setting for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: yes no risk after @d lead|pg||
nt|kit: South doesn't think his partner has the ace of clubs, so heart plays look like only defense to him.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last 2 sets have seen at least 3 instances of raising partner's major suit overcall with Jx|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|clinch: 2NT would make on a @s lead if Smith ran lead to his 9|pg||

nt|ahollan1: did i post link to Chagas' article this or previous set?|pg||
nt|ritong: previous|pg||

nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridgeace.com/lessons/BOLS/1974_Chagas_I_Love_Finesses.pdf|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Polowan: signals? Rodwell: upside down|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|clinch: In truth I think they'd defend it right, but we shall never know|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  OUTSTANDING JOB, Eric. Loud appreciative applause|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks you Henry :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|clinch: but still a swing to tighten the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still playing weak NT|pg||

nt|mdgraham: may be worried about his realtively poor trumps|pg||
nt|kit: 4@D by South might be RKC.  Walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: any 6 trump is good opposite 4+ trump :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=NF  a) 2/3@H, Strong NT  b) 3@H, not 4@S, unbal  c) 4@H, 15-19 HCP|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=5+suit, INV|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 2N would show exactly 5@H invite|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: i might have reopened with a double with the N hand|pg||
