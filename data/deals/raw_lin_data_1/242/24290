nt|barnets: the only lead|pg||
nt|barnets: to defeat contarct|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|grebrof: will he play Helness for a stiff?|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that it matters|pg||
nt|kit: not likely -- declarer wouldn't have ducked first spade if that were the case|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|grebrof: declarer doesnt know the location of the A of @h or who might have a ruff - the noncontinuance of @s makes it more like the way it is|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|d!|an|5!H|nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
mb|r|nt|osvaill83: probably start with a routine 3nt :)|pg||

mb|1H|an|3!H|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||
pc|sT|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||
nt|phil: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|phil: same lead in OR|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|phil: Rosenberg ducked, diamond returned...not that anything really matters on this layout|pg||
pc|d9|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||
nt|riccho:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012Dublin/systems/OpenTeams/Monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: can get out for -2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: and he is likely to get spades right|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||
nt|pelu:  CC for EW: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|d4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d6|pc|h9|nt|kit: Zia has chosen to not play spades and hope the opponents have to break the suit.  But I don't think they will have to do so.|pg||
nt|3for3: cant he ruff this and exit heart?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I guess he can -- or ruff this, ruff heart, exit with diamond|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: Or he can just keep discarding -- both lines work.|pg||

nt|kit: I guess 1@H was a manufactured call for a hand which didn't fit nicely into anything else|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|psyck: must be 4@h|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzfu: no, 4@S|pg||
nt|ritong: quite amazing|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think they have a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfu: Helness looks perplexed|pg||
nt|ritong: a missund about 2@h|pg||
nt|kit: it looks like N-S had a mixup here -- apparently South thought 2@H Michaels|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@h was misunderstood after all|pg||
nt|barnets: he did not play 2@H as nat|pg||
nt|kit: Although it is hard to believe such an experienced partnership hasn't discussed such a simple auction as this.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: they probably do, but Helness should still pass - Helgemo didnt overcall 1@s|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, Helness won't be in on the joke, so will probably bid 5@S|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think Helgemo made the mistake here|pg||
nt|barnets: yes an helness knows he is mistaken|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: this should tighten the match a bit|pg||
nt|barnets: as well as unsettling N/S some|pg||
nt|grebrof: which we need for this match to become more interesting|pg||
nt|psyck: around 3 down|pg||
nt|grebrof: if you cant introduce 1@s, you cant have that suit at the 4level - very strange bid from Helness|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: other room in 5@h over 5@d as of now|pg||
nt|barnets: If north suspects his partner has forgot the system he would tend not to bid 5@S|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead better|pg||
nt|barnets: unless that is taking advantage|pg||
nt|kit: you just don't play your partner to have forgotten something as simple as this|pg||
nt|kit: Helness doesn't have any unauthorized info, so he can do whatever he wants|pg||
nt|barnets: well hed did not exactly bid a sharp 5@S|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|barnets: but a tortuous one|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|grebrof: 1@h was an ok bid - you want P to bid 1nt if he has something in @s|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ritong: willenken' s improvisation turned out well in a highly unexpected way|pg||
nt|kit: Drawing trump the old-fashioned way :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@h sould go similarly down, but undoubled other room|pg||
nt|kit: Actually things went very well for declarer|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s A unblocking 9 and a @c?|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2 down only|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1 down|pg||
nt|kit: He should know the shape, with East having 1 heart and zero clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, once defense did not punch on lead, declarer could punch defense instead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|sK|pc|h7|nt|grebrof: maybe two|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|grebrof: now he can ruff on both hands or unblock and draw trumps - 1 down|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, only requires a little care not to block trumps now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: I'm sure it isn't|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|ritong: this can|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: this can t be|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d3|pc|c4|mc|10|nt|kit: so, just another routine draw trumps and claim hand|pg||
nt|ritong: 3 impsz for such a mess is cheap|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, very lucky|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead could have fetched 12 imps imstead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfu: director here -- Willenken led the club thinking dummy had clubs and spades because of the misexplanation.|pg||
pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4SJ96HQ87DT5CAJT54,S43HJ63DKJ4CKQ763,SA872HAKT952DC982,SKQT5H4DAQ987632C|sv|n|nt|vugraphzfv: 2 of the small discards (for jill meyers) were wrong on vugraph, apologies. But did not affect the outcome. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: levin says "we should just play open notes"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hello. only score is accurate cos we started late|pg||
mb|5D|nt|phil: so what to open on an 8-4 :)? |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: you don't see these hands in textbooks|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Zimmerman had to be tempted to bid 6@d here|pg||
nt|phil: it cant be that expensive, and who knows who makes what? |pg||
nt|phil: yet, partner's 5@d made them guess|pg||
nt|phil: maybe East should x 5@h?  he has some surprise defense|pg||
nt|phil: although I'm not really clear what a w/w 5m opening is supposed to show|pg||
nt|phil: but definitely not KQTx in a side major :)|pg||
nt|phil: NS appear to have four losers, but it seems like they would have a hard time taking all four|pg||
nt|phil: give east Axxx of clubs, and 6@d actually makes - but so does 6M (probably)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
nt|phil: this will compress one of the losers|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: I think Martel will just come back a spade -- bigger danger declarer has ace of clubs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: wrong again|pg||
nt|phil: so an undoubled vulnerable save against a making 5@d'|pg||
pc|h8|nt|3for3: even playing 0/2 leads, wouldn't know if his honor was Q or K|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: Anyway, this speeds things up.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||

nt|psyck: there could be an adjustment in the score then|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|d|mb|3D|nt|kit: seems vicious when you have a mixup, get to the silly contract, and then get hurt further from having mis-explained the bid, but that is the way it should be.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ritong: dura lex  sed lex|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@d a max 4@s bid with 5+@s presumably|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: I'm sort of surprised that West bid 4@H, assuming 4@D is a slam try in spades|pg||
nt|kit: But maybe West thought it choice of games.|pg||
nt|barnets: dec thinks he can ruff 3@D |pg||
nt|grebrof: its good to see that these sometimes have mixups too - even how good they are|pg||
nt|barnets: that would give him 10|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d4|nt|barnets: but he cant|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|phil: oh|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, 6@d is definitely possible|pg||
mb|1D|an|5+!D, unbal, unless 4441|mb|2N|an|!H+!C|nt|3for3: ew might sniff around at slam here|pg||
nt|phil: I like 1@d. I loathe 2N|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he was afraid of pushing NS to a makeable slam?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: as I said before you arrived - Multon's 5@d have his opps a tough guess - and they might have guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|phil: *gave|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: They have a lot of high cards for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if Kamil bid 5@d (and why shouldn't he?) the spades would have been buried|pg||
nt|phil: now Zimmerman can pattern out|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: they like their 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will keep them out of any slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: true, but from helgemo's POV cant east hace a stiff club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he though partner had heart support I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 5@H was a bold bid, in the jaws of unfavourable vulnurability |pg||
nt|phil: yeah - along with some nice defense too|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: solo|pg||
nt|xenya: all in all well done by both sides on the last hand|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|phil: 4@h does not handle well|pg||
nt|phil: he's tapped down to parity at T1|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike 4@S?|pg||
nt|phil: if hearts break OK, he can manage 4H + 5S + 1C and doesn't need the club hook|pg||
nt|phil: in spades can't you take 5S in hand, 3 ruffs in dummy plus two aces? |pg||
nt|xenya: unless they lead a trump|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: in the other room, N didn't get in -- still, S found a @C lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: he can, but even then there might not be 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|phil: yes that may cause difficulties - but maybe declarer can make something out of the heart suit then|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|3for3: q of clubs was the q of hearts, and slam is laydown|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|kit: I don't really see What Helgemo can bid but 4@S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: Maybe 5@S, focusing attention on club control at the slight risk of going down there.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|phil: so there may be some counters - hard to say who comes out on top|pg||
nt|phil: but overall 4@s looks worlds better than 4@h|pg||
nt|phil: ruffing looks a little better here - the diamond suit is tied up if he does|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: in any case, i wholly agree with what you said about the 2N bid, Phil -- E's hand just doesn't qualify|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil: but if he draws the last trump, what does he pitch from dummy? |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|phil: now the hand falls apart|pg||

nt|phil: 3N is excellent NS|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: I agree -- that's why I think he has to just bid 4@S and hope that if East has a stiff club he can make a move.|pg||

nt|xenya: yeah|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: hmm not sure if 2h or 2c should be alerted as garbage stayman. just happy i made out what she wrote.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: N is not concerned about hearts here, rather about the quality of the 1D suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: just a spade doubleton and some aces|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some confusion over the x? |pg||
nt|phil: double these days generally means anything but penalty|pg||
mb|5D|nt|3for3: a variation of 5 card stayman|pg||

pc|h2|nt|kit: Declarer has problems here.  Even with the clubs coming in, there are only 8 winners.|pg||

pc|hA|nt|phil: so why 5@d??|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|xenya: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|3for3: and 9th trick to come from spades.|pg||

nt|grebrof: @H K|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thinking|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is generally 'transfer me' and 4@d is 'you bid it' - which Kamil will do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it will work out|pg||
nt|phil: looks like he wanted to protect any diamond cards in Marty's hand|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman has the world's fair on this auction|pg||
nt|phil: now - Zimmerman should be less excited about playing hearts now|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d advertises length in both|pg||
nt|xenya: if he bids 4@H, he will make it|pg||
nt|phil: NS can make a lot of sapdes however|pg||
nt|phil: I think they bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: assuming it gets passed out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Zimmermann in the tank. |pg||
nt|phil: 4@h is a little awkward to play - but I think South has the option of losing one of his trump tricks or allowing the diamond pitch to be taken, right? |pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C doesn't look too bad either -- until you see the whole layout|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, hearts that are "Hawaii" (5-0) is very bad for both|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps just an interesting, how do you stop 4@s? |pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Interesting -- so Zia didn't work out that West could dodge the end-play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helgemo embarassed he threw his @H away|pg||
mb|4S|mb|4N|nt|phil: I would take dbl of 4@d as 'cards' and a subsequent x of 4@s as penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now 5NT or 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades are shakey, i think 4 enough|pg||

mb|5N|nt|Vugraphzfv: action!|pg||
nt|phil: aieee|pg||

nt|xenya: N might pass  now?|pg||
mb|d|nt|3for3: well, north is a PH, so with just hearts he can just bid them, either a weak 2, or 2@H at second turn|pg||
nt|phil: Lightner from Fleisher now? |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: a quick -2|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: good point Danny -- I forgot about initial pass|pg||
pc|h9|nt|grebrof: what to bid than 2@d?|pg||

mb|1D|nt|vugraphzfv: is weak 2s with east's hand ever okay? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not a jump fit|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher have had a lot of small swings by simply allowing less undertricks than Zimmerman this set|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|3for3: AND a big result here too|pg||
nt|kit: The good news for Fleisher here is that both pairs have a disaster on the same board|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, agree|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, that tends to compress the imps lost|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for diamond but patapon played heart. and so did disa. so they then redid it|pg||
nt|phil: in old KS, an early weak NT system, 3@s showed a powerhouse|pg||
pc|s3|nt|medwards: mildred is a very nice lady. she many good stories from the old days|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzfv: we'll make sure to ask her about the good ole days then :)|pg||

mb|d|nt|osvaill83: and theres more to come :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: deciding between club and diamond|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfv: but only this + 1 other board so they should be fine.|pg||
