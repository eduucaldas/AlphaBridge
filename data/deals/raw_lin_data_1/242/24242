nt|ahollan1: they have other bids when holding both|pg||

pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge responded 1N with south hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: this will probably depend on the heart suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@d presumably a help suit kind of bid & with a doubleton & 4th trump, W accepts|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS upside-down count & attitude|pg||

mb|d|mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: 3@D looms|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the slow X is played by many as takeout|pg||
nt|bigtrain: to penalize usually he would have had to X 2@C to show cards|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bigtrain: i think thats what N is thinking about|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asks about 2NT but I can't see answer |pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: they play that defense over strong NT openers|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think it was minors|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is the weak NT defense|pg||
nt|bigtrain: tey trat ALL 3rd seat NT openers as weak|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asks Wooldridge about the DBL of 2@h - says "he's not sure" Wooldridge: "penalty"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfb: That's because Meck & Hurd are on the same side of the screen, so normally he'd ask Hurd but at this point, he can ask dummy instead|pg||

nt|bigtrain: i think that is the winning line mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but discarding the diamonds looked a normal enough thing to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: In the other room, Martel bid 3@h instead of 3@d, & playing there|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kit: it would be pretty double-dummy, as crossruff line works when trumps split|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed - so easy when you can see all the cards|pg||
nt|bigtrain: didn't say it was right...  just winning :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what does Glubok bid now?|pg||
nt|kit: even then not so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Their 1@h must be pretty sound if this is a fav vul 2@h for them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well --- i didn't expect 2@C from Woolsey|pg||
nt|kit: possible 6@C here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possible 6@c here EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I prefer a splinter 3@H with West hand -- as long as you are raising, why not describe?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg:  welcome Martin and Joe :) i'll be watching you from voice|pg||
pc|h7|nt|clinch: Well now NS are California, EW NY - ahe bidding looks a bit better :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Hedy suggests their 2@h may be an intermediate hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  50  2@S made in other room|pg||
nt|kit: Now he splinters -- seems like a strange order to do things|pg||
nt|kit: lucky to get the chance when East happened to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|kit: But now have to start the slam exploration a level higher|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: sorry  down in other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this side of the pond 2@c doesn't promise the earth, so 3@h would be aggressive with poorish spades |pg||
nt|kit: some say that maybe 3@H wouldn't have been a splinter in their methods -- certainly possible|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the problem is that RKC is too high now |pg||
nt|bigtrain: or at least it may be|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: I don't understand the logic of the double of 4@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hello again |pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfc: Hi Jow, Martin and Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Joe :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West can redouble |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 w/othe queen forces a poor slam then|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like it just gives the opponents more room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|clinch: hi Krishna|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, that's assuming 4@H is a splinter -- it might have been RKC|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: well they found 4@S    please don't ask me how|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: Whatever it all meant, East did drive to slam|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: Slam far from cold, but cards lie favorable and I think any reasonable line of play will make|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|clinch: Innocuos board to start - three obvious losers|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|clinch: innocuous even|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: One possible danger is if declarer takes a crossruff approach, he may at the end try to get back to his hand with diamond ruff instead of spade ruff.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Smith in 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brad Moss raised to 2@H rather than Lev's 1N|pg||
nt|kit: But declarer will probably be trying to set up spades first, and will get the news there|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if Lev consistent -- 1N   then what does Woolsey do?|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|xenya: 2N looks like strongly invitational|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: @d would have been a normal lead except for the 1@d bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, so let's see - will take a bit of making|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead should get defense 2@s, 1@h , 1@c tricks|pg||
nt|kit: East has the right type of strength for double I think -- not enough for slam, but enough to expect to get more than value of game|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck: other room south lead a @c after a similar auction|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, likely to play a @s to K or Q|pg||
nt|psyck: yes it should be in this seq after xx 1st|pg||
nt|kit: I like this opening lead -- who needs to lead sequences?|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 11 or 1400|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East's bidding normally indicates a pretty strong desire to defend|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: prblem with @c is that declarer may be able to set up a @c trick for @h pitch|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|xenya: so it's either 3@D or 3N -- i'm surprised at S's pass |pg||

nt|xenya: declarer could afford 2nd round of trumps since even if they were 4-1, 2 rounds of diamonds would assure 10 tricks on most layouts |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: players are back|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Since the count wasn't rectified, no simple squeezes would work.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree  but when running a squeeze i mix up the order of discards|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is not inverted raise,|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: expected 2NT rather than 3NT - but North would raise anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if partner has a 12-14 hand he judged 2@D safer|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I could see the 2@d bid if 1@d showed an unbalanced hand, but that certainly doesn't seem to be the case here.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|bigtrain: i picked 3@S here|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|clinch: Quite close to slam here, but not quite enough maybe?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect that 1@D does however promise 4 cards|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Avoiding the 1nt response by north had the effect of right-siding the eventual nt contract (although it wouldn't seem to matter here.)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck: 6@c has a chance|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfc: Meltzer: carding? Polowan: standard, Smith, o/e discards|pg||

nt|psyck: no, can't ruff as u say, on red suit sqz  on W|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes that may work|pg||
nt|psyck: so 6NT would make too similarly|pg||

nt|fabsayc: we use to start with 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would be 4+@H  NOT normal negative dbl|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C would show the reds and 2NT would show more of the reds|pg||
nt|kit: E-W may not have agreements on meaning of double by East here|pg||
nt|kit: Could be important for him to show his spade support|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: not sure how Martel shows 4-fit with strong NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D?|pg||
nt|kit: This could be support double -- but does West know that?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: depends on agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: South will probably bid 4@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lilienstein: 2NT? Meck: reds|pg||
nt|kit: And now the bidding escalates|pg||
mb|6N|nt|xenya: but then, of course, i may be missing something deeper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S would just be unbal min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i'd be wrong|pg||
nt|bigtrain: when eric came up wit the idea of support X he played them through the 4-level|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no support passes only occur at the 1 and 2-level though|pg||
nt|kit: Still don't know if it was support double, as West would bid 4@S regardless with his hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the OR North bid up to 6@d all by himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C Ger....no, better not say it. Roland might be watching |pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Though 3 makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: North will certainly get to 6@D -- the only question is whether he gets there fast or slowly|pg||
nt|bigtrain: walking the dog?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but the crux here is the club queen, so set that suit as trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: and is actually a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|kit: I guess it was support double (at least East thinks so), since if he hadn't shown support he would surely have bid 5@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and led ace and another heart, too - well done|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: so maybe like Kaplan-Sheinwold   2@S = 4-fit BAL strong NT OR 4-fit unbal [so re-evaluates to extras]|pg||
nt|kit: And now the 6@D bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5nt forces to slam and invites 7 but would not help, so wests approach is practical|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however using 4@C as a slam try in clubs with a suit lacking two top is ok, since the bid has next to no use in the modern style|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E is trying to figure out what (given w's spectacularly bad @c spots) what the surest method of taking 4 @c tricks is.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess the surest method is a 3-2 break |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lilienstein takes a restroom break, came back and found that no card is played|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or maybe  low to the 9?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfc: Smith alerted 3@C but Moss did not|pg||

nt|fabsayc: on rodwell auction west could not double 3@S to invite a sac since that would say dont lead a spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Becker is asking for the meaning of first lead |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Becker: normally what do you lead from 4 small cards?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: isnt the real danger a 4-1 heart break?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Polowan: judge from the number, could be either 2nd or 4th|pg||

mb|p|nt|clinch: NS making 4@h here |pg||
nt|kit: here is my suggested splinter -- now will South cooperate?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be worried about his realtively poor trumps|pg||
nt|kit: 4@D by South might be RKC.  Walter?|pg||
