mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||

nt|kit: hi Danny|pg||
mb|r|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
mb|d|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||
nt|riccho:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012Dublin/systems/OpenTeams/Monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: can get out for -2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: and he is likely to get spades right|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||
nt|pelu:  CC for EW: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|kit: Zia has chosen to not play spades and hope the opponents have to break the suit.  But I don't think they will have to do so.|pg||
nt|3for3: cant he ruff this and exit heart?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I guess he can -- or ruff this, ruff heart, exit with diamond|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: Or he can just keep discarding -- both lines work.|pg||

nt|3for3: well done|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: levin says "we should just play open notes"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hello. only score is accurate cos we started late|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||

pc|c5|nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|3for3: quite thin game.  needs clubs to behave, 44 diamonds for starters|pg||
nt|3for3: and 9th trick to come from spades.|pg||
nt|grebrof: !k and switch to @ds?|pg||
nt|grebrof: @H K|pg||
nt|kit: If East does shift to king of hearts, declarer will definitely win the trick|pg||
nt|kit: Since he is looking at down 1 if he ducks.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes. but it will make the defense easy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: can power out the hand|pg||
nt|kit: oh my!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|3for3: a super grovesnor!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: well was better to start the spades|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: of course Zia couldn't duck, but if he had .....|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d3|pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: then if necessary could have ruffed the fourth and fifth spade|pg||
nt|3for3: helness 'knows' south cant duck that|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: Now will take spade finesse and be down 3.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s6|nt|3for3: meanwhile 3nt came in at other table so big swing to monaco|pg||
nt|xenya: W is sort of sqaueezed|pg||
nt|grebrof: the lead was good again|pg||
nt|kit: either red suit would have been effective lead|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|osvaill83: makes now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzfv: lost track sorry|pg||
nt|xenya: now he can make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D now and made :)|pg||
nt|osvaill83: could have endplayed helgemo|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but Zia couldn't possibly read the position I don't think.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|grebrof: Helness probably had aheartattack when that @h ( fell :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 8|pg||
nt|kit: he can still do the end-play|pg||
nt|grebrof: @h 8|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think he will make it|pg||
nt|kit: Helgemo obviously fooled by the low heart shift, although it seems like he should have figured it out since declarer known to have 5 spades from auction.|pg||
nt|grebrof: @d K and endplay dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Zia knows opponents have made a mistake somewhere -- he just has to figure out where.|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, Rosenberg opened 1@H as E (3rd seat), W bid spades, and that was that |pg||
nt|grebrof: o, than K of !@d and small to 9|pg||
nt|kit: actually he can't make -- Helgemo can win diamond and exit low diamond.|pg||
nt|3for3: and he does know the whole hand at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 9@D covers|pg||
nt|kit: this looked like it would be a relatively dull hand, but things sure got interesting.|pg||
nt|grebrof: after watching Willenken and Rosenberg yesterday, I never thought they would ever be ahead|pg||
nt|kit: Still, it does seem as though Helgemo should have kept his heart.  I don't see how that could ever have been wrong whatever the hand is.|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|kit: Key was East's spade discard -- I can't imagine East would have pitched spade if he had an honor -- and if declarer has AK of spades then East must have king of hearts or we are ...|pg||
nt|kit: wasting our time.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: mumbling Zia: "What could it possibly be?"|pg||
nt|xenya: no imps ar stake|pg||
nt|3for3: at least 1 at stake|pg||
nt|kit: I can see Zia reading the position.  If so, he will win ace of spades, and lead jack of diamonds throwing the 9 -- hoping West has K108x.  And the West underleads and East claims|pg||
nt|3for3: that would be neat ending|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting point -- West led 5 of diamonds, so apparently they lead 3/5 vs. NT.  Thus, the end-play can't work.|pg||
nt|grebrof: even they dont lead 8 from KT85|pg||
nt|kit: And West isn't likely to be making a falsecard on lead on this kind of auction.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: scores are correct but not the play/bidding obviously :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|vugraphzfv: 4 more boards. insurmountable odds against team joel|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, it was 8|pg||
nt|kit: A chance for Fleisher to get some IMPs back if they can somehow diagonse this slam|pg||
mb|2S|an|weak-ish|mb|3H|nt|grebrof: at the other table I think it was a jumpfit|pg||
nt|grebrof: here explained as weakish|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe the problem will be even getting to game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: explained as weak, but how weak based off vul|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has been looking at the CC - its a jumpfit, but weakish then|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: those who really want to have commentary, try to go to new bbo version at www.bridgebase.com . there is audio commentary there|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think many nowadays just bid at the 1 level when they have no fit|pg||

nt|kit: The good news for Fleisher here is that both pairs have a disaster on the same board|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzfv: willard let down the partition now. she's whispering to valerie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but unfortunately i can't hear them|pg||

pc|sA|nt|medwards: this hand should be a push i would think|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for diamond but patapon played heart. and so did disa. so they then redid it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|medwards: mildred is a very nice lady. she many good stories from the old days|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzfv: we'll make sure to ask her about the good ole days then :)|pg||

pc|dK|mc|11|nt|vugraphzfv: quite a few zzz kibitzers kibbing this table. zzz used to be those who logged in anonymously to kib|pg||
