nt|othered1: Do NS play double shows 4+@S?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|doctorone: yes, and 1@s would have been a negative double equivalent|pg||

nt|doctorone: sure there are, Ed... But here it seems reasonable to pass|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C after the cue bid would imply a stronger hand to me.|pg||
nt|doctorone: agree|pg||
nt|othered1: Unless north has limited his hand somehow.|pg||
nt|doctorone: 5@c is playable, of course|pg||

nt|Walddk3: 6@S is almost 80% I think. Even when spades are 4-1 you make when diamonds are 3-3|pg||
nt|henryb:  Multon might try 6N -- if opener had the @hJ 6N would be a much better contract|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: As we  get ready to start the board, let me say, many thanks, to our operator Quentin.  A job well done!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|othered1: Too good for a weak 2.  A matter of how high East pushes this hand.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S from N - 3@H by S? and 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Multi makes this tough|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H now has a different meaning for most|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to the commentators Mike, Drew and Rashed.   We appreciate your time, insights and humor.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments,  we appreciate them. |pg||
nt|sybarra: you keep us on the straight and narrow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|doctorone: sure Ed, I think that a weak two is out of the picture|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: u could start with 2!G and then bid 3@D - but agree - very diff after Multi 2@d|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: @C position could make the most straightforward line unlucky|pg||
nt|doctorone: true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H is pass or correct|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|pelu: 2!G = 2@h :)|pg||
