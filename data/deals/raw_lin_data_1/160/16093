mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|djneill:  East Passes 1@c with an eye on the vulnerablity - that @s suit is moth-eaten|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|djneill:  as playing  a 4-3 fit is not too good, North's 3@h should be forcing to game, just confirming the fit along the way in case South has 5@h, though one would think South would have a checkback available with 5@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  East leads a nice-looking @s but North's spots are a mood-dampener|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|djneill:  after the deluge of spades, the count will be rectified (lost 3 tricks, have 9) and a squeeze in @h-@d is an option that happens to work, though there is no risk in the @d finesse since West is out of @s at that point|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|djneill:  there is a small clue that the @dQ is offsides -if East had @sKJxxx  @hxx  @dQxx @cAxx for example they might have overcalled 1@s|pg||

nt|djneill:  nifty, East does not cash the @s, wow, there must have been a clue somewhere - otherwise it looks pretty odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  North delays the moment of truth in @d, also in case East has both the @dT and @d9 (the 8 forces the Queen)|pg||

nt|djneill:  North really wanted East to play spades, Chan made a great switch!|pg||

nt|djneill:  that's right john it worked out very well, how often do you buy it at 2@s when the opponents have 24 HCP|pg||
nt|bucheister: most likely down one but the defense must be careful|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bucheister: Certainly not a text book weak two but still effective.|pg||
nt|djneill:  this 24 HCP though is a bad mesh, does not do very well in 3NT|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's 2@h response was pass/correct, and West is supposed to Pass with @h, or bid @s with @s|pg||
nt|bucheister: North might have upgraded that hand to  15 and bid 2nt and that would have led to 3nt|pg||
