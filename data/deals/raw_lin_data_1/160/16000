nt|djehuti:  actually playing in 5@c , there is a good chance that declarer will drop the singleton king, after say, @s lead and @c|pg||

nt|vicky888:  Hello all, hi mahesh :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Vicky|pg||
nt|mango joe: a 2@C opening in precision often has a  card major as it did in this case at the other table|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4 card major|pg||
nt|mrdct:  4@h for EW looks good here|pg||
nt|mango joe: he had a chance to test the @S and then perhaps guess if E had Kx or W had 10x @H|pg||
nt|mango joe: once @S didnt break|pg||
nt|mango joe: cards lie nicely for E/W here|pg||
nt|mango joe: good duck of @H by Arun|pg||
nt|xenya: that @H was a wrong move |pg||
nt|mdgraham: what about playing a spade and jettisoning the @HA? |pg||
nt|sybarra: presumable nicely played|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Raju|pg||

nt|sybarra: *presumably|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  do you transfer to clubs with the South hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Thx Roland Hi all namaste Arunda|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double-dummy of course|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: we have a strong club |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: today the drinks are on the house ...by the organisers|pg||
nt|viren169: and one for you, no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is routine now |pg||
nt|vicky888:  Amazing start for Hemant Jalan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: A fit Jump by Rana showing hand better than 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: easy 3NT here for N/S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mango joe: 6@C and 6NT both make though very unlikely to be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: We are in the wrong place!|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: o|pg||
nt|vicky888:  light 3rd seat opening will need to take out to 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: still 11 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and I also will act as W now - non vulnerable|pg||
nt|mango joe: wonder what 2@S is, its certainly not weak but 9 tricks seems to be the limit here with 2 trump losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it is interesting, as it has to play three tricks better|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: That is a nice touch--wish they would do that here too  --well done|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|paulg:  Sandy Duncan is one of the most conservative bidders that I know ... a very solid and sound player|pg||
nt|mrdct:  stiff @cA is a little bit hard to evaluate - but west has nothing more to say than 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  @s lead best for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1@sx pass interesting other room|pg||
nt|xenya: winning play |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the double of 4@c might have meant "don't lead a @c"|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|mango joe: another good board for Poddar|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: interesting  spade ace went away |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a strong 1@C auction to 4@H here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure what 2@S was meant to achieve--3@H looked better--stronger than a direct 4@H |pg||
nt|viren169: just showing 4@S on the way - I guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: 11 tricks--next |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: let @cK win|pg||
nt|paulg:  is Duncan still thinking?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks more like a deadlock:)|pg||
nt|mango joe: the vulnerability had something to do with pass I suppose|pg||
nt|mango joe: am too old fashioned to like opening on a 4333 11 count|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ace was spayed?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is that possible?|pg||

nt|mango joe: apparently its 11-13 with 6 card @S|pg||

nt|sybarra: Marshall,  S is listening|pg||
mb|d|nt|mango joe: esp in the last round of the round robin|pg||
nt|mrdct:  5@s might still make on a non-@c lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  opportunity for australia to win imps here as 6@s was reached in the other room by the forminables|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzat: system doesnt allow|pg||
nt|ian111:  beat wales25-5 to qualify for the semi of the commwealth|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mango joe: qualified for the semis by the skin of their teeth |pg||

mb|4H|nt|viren169: I have to admit I'm in the 1N-3N camp.|pg||
nt|garnetts: with AQxxx in a minor it will be 5 tricks a lot of the time and you should bid 3NT in my view because partner will never know that|pg||

nt|garnetts: For once we agree Gad |pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect this will a swing for Wales|pg||

nt|marlowepi: NS on diferent wavelegths|pg||

nt|marlowepi: N meant 3S as directional|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S obviously thought it was slammish in hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mango joe: might get too high|pg||
pc|s8|nt|garnetts: The crux of this hand comes next --|pg||
nt|viren169: Whatever opener has.. 3N is a good bet most of the time!|pg||
nt|viren169: Oh dear... Flat board - I lost again!|pg||
nt|mango joe: this should mke unless he plays @S to K|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@H is not an odds on contract and will fail here unless declerer plays for a 4/1 @H after discovering 6/2 @DS|pg||
nt|mango joe: he shud be able to do it when W doesnt try to give East a ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: now all should be clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there's not a lot to go on - given East is short in hearts, North may well go wrong|pg||
nt|mango joe: but W can give E ast a ruff if the latter had a trump|pg||
nt|xenya: no Mike, Sajid is right|pg||
pc|sK|nt|suketbombi: 2@S was a forced bid on which Rana showed @HS and @Cs+ game force|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West won't play @hA and another - which may alert a suspicious North|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: oddly enough 2-1 scores here because it will start either with 1@D or 1@C and the 1NT response will show up to a about 11 and clubs which will shut east up for the right reasons |pg||
nt|suketbombi: Mahesh can we have the udate on scores?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes sorry that was for 7@H:)|pg||

nt|mango joe: on bidding K@C stands out|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and thus didnt bid 4C for fear it would excite N too much|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure if thought slammish, but at least a game force (imo)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S doesnt seem to have condioered the possibility that N might not have 4 hearts, and just have been stuck for a bid over 1S|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what I would bid with N either,  messy hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mango joe: declarer may go for both @D honours with N in order to try make|pg||
nt|mango joe: only hope|pg||
nt|suketbombi: luckily stayed out of what I must say an odds on Slam|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzat: http://61.247.239.200:8080/cba/jspCWB2010index.jsp|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me double is clearcut. this wasnt about judgment, it was about what they think the bids mean. th overarching principle should be "Game before Slam"///that is, if there are 2 ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plausible interpretations of a bid in a sequence, one related to choice of games and the other to slam prospects, assing the former meaning|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct:  actually - doen't make any diff - just a technique thing|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: I am not a fan of giving up like this---when defending always try and think about how you might beat the contract--at least when its not pairs |pg||
nt|mango joe: unlikely now|pg||
nt|mango joe: surprisingly even 4@S went off in the other room so not much damage|pg||
nt|xenya: looks obvious doesn't it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry - I should read the comments :)|pg||

pc|s3|nt|suketbombi: what happens if 3 indian Teams qualify which is likely here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Arvind will let u know|pg||
nt|suketbombi: my comments earlier were for 7@H|pg||
nt|figo: before this last rd , scores are : Australia 419 , Jalan 395 , India 1 385|pg||
nt|mango joe: defence have to play a @C at some point to cut communications|pg||
nt|mango joe: like right now|pg||
nt|mango joe: anything else gives the contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: rana would not be too happy here but difficult to Judge as @CJ playes a vital role|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mango joe: wd|pg||
nt|ian111:  well done|pg||
nt|mango joe: now 2 off as N will signal for @cs|pg||

mb|p|nt|suketbombi: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can postpone that if hearts are OK|pg||
mb|1N|nt|suketbombi: but what happens if 3 indian teams qualify?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Hemant Jalan anyways not eligible for any Medals...Im i right Arvind|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  south might've tried for a miracle game here given the state of the match|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but even 2NT is in danger here|pg||
nt|frankaus: coffee hand 3NT will not trouble declarer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mango joe: both 3N & 4@S ok here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes true iam saying if @HS were Ok @CJ was vital on a @D lead|pg||
nt|arunbapat: 3NT by W is on will Rana Bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|arunbapat: No|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: yes medal is not the end of the world mahesh and One of the Hemant Jalan Team Member has a  CWG medal|pg||
nt|mango joe: e?W playing either weak or variable NT|pg||
nt|mrdct:  although 3-3 @h will please declarer|pg||
nt|mango joe: @Hs are 3-3, @Cs are blocked, A@D is right & @S finesse is right|pg||
nt|mrdct:  entries to dummy are limited though - he may not be abel to lead @d towards hand twice|pg||
nt|mango joe: 5 losers i can see|pg||
nt|xenya: W didn't continue hearts because he knew E was out of trumps at that point|pg||
nt|xenya: last hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7222 is a nasty shape for a vulnerable pre-empt - still, the suit is reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: What would you have bid David with East's hand?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is an interesting auction--North could not find a bid over 2@H --but in my view should have over 3@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: @CT lead wod have been a hit:)|pg||
nt|mango joe: 3@S 4@H + 1@D shud be easy|pg||
nt|mrdct:  yes - 2NT is cold|pg||
nt|mrdct:  if playing on @D, most liekly it will be low to the 10|pg||
nt|mango joe: if he leads a @D now|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes thats possible|pg||
nt|mango joe: he will probably play on @Hs next|pg||
nt|mango joe: could be a big swing to Australia who seem to have the momentum|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|figo: wow|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @S lead and @H shift in good time|pg||
nt|mango joe: weak NT very popular in the UK|pg||
nt|mango joe: 2@D is asking about major suit holdings|pg||
nt|mango joe: West is denying 3@S or 4@H|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: I would have bid 4@H as East|pg||
nt|viren169: 3 looks a bit wet for my liking...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Anal has a Gold in last CWG if I am not mistakev?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: u right |pg||
nt|suketbombi: Thx Mahesh|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  this should go down when they find the heart ruff|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: he heard u Raju|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzat: open room in 4@h im told|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H pre-emptively is likely to get them in too often |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|viren169: North had 1 eye on the vul I guess...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzat: ok open room has crossed 4@h..overboard|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H & yelling for @S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H 7|pg||

pc|d4|nt|vugraphzat: waiting for sandeep to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: no|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|paulg:  good switch!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: after 3@H North might try 3NT  for the minors or in view the double implies minors as he might have acted before with spades |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|paulg:  less good switch|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|suketbombi: no more @S discard anal:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Duncan still needs to return a diamond otherwise it will disappear|pg||
nt|mrdct:  if @h are 3-3 he only needs 1 @d trick buy if @H are 4-2 he needs 2 @d tricks - but he doesn't know how many @d tricks he needs until after he's exhausted his entries to dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|viren169: Dble is more flexible...|pg||

nt|ian111:  maybe they play weak in 4th|pg||

pc|d7|pc|sT|nt|arunbapat: No double from Manas may may be 4333 discouraged him..would be expecting a reopening from P with suitable hand.No action from Rana too was surprising..he is very aggresive |pg||

nt|ian111:  1nt struggling|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mango joe: looks like 1 off|pg||

pc|h6|nt|frankaus: E is squeesed|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mango joe: may go more off if he plys @s to K|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  Gordon probably expected Duncan to lead a singleton heart initially|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzat: rest |pg||
nt|paulg:  and he never reevaluated|pg||
nt|paulg:  Gordon and Duncan are both veterans of Scottish bridge although I don't think that they have played much together|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  Irving Gordon won the World Senior Pairs with a 90-year-old Boris Shapiro|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm not sure what west's dbl means. perhaps a side 4-card suit where bidding 3@d would show 5-5|pg||
nt|mango joe: if this is 12-14 then N should pass or tfr to @D|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzat: if Hemant jalan eam win here...the winner of the Aus vs Scotland will win the gold medal|pg||
nt|mrdct:  possibly a pass missed here|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Same for u and kibs Paul|pg||
nt|mango joe: This hasnt been an exciting set so has favoured the teams leading in their matches|pg||
nt|mrdct:  it's been a long month of bridge for paul gosney who played in the Rosenblum, then the World Youth Championships, then the Commonwealth Nations and now the HCL - I'm sure he's feeling a little bit homesick by now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: NS have now passed the best contract 3nt|pg||
nt|mango joe: dont much care for Norths opening as he doesnt have a rebid over 2@Cs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: They have also pinpointed the defence too --no heart control |pg||
nt|viren169: North was hoping they went on!|pg||
nt|garnetts: North should lead the A@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: this will clear things up for him|pg||
nt|garnetts: If he doesn't like that the A@H is a standout |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: north asking east....thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: Not an easy lead...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|suketbombi: have a great party thx for the brodcast and Good luck for the taj trip see you on Friday|pg||

nt|mango joe: Hemant need something good to happen soon|pg||

pc|d9|nt|mango joe: @s back will still beat it|pg||
nt|mango joe: no. needed to duck @S|pg||
nt|mango joe: 5@S shows Q@H i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: yes|pg||
nt|mango joe: can he find out about Q@S?|pg||
nt|mango joe: he cant bid 7 with any surety|pg||
nt|mango joe: he knows abut K@D A@C and Q to four @hs|pg||
nt|mango joe: and he knows that N will have a bit more for his opening |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: hoping that partner has @sq also|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes but it will be on a hope rather than certainty|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: I can understand the @s lead from E|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps i am wrong about the last hand -- if S doesn't open, EW may well get to 3N or 4@H, with some good practical chances of making|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|frankaus: @C 3-3 will be a noce suprise to declarer|pg||
nt|frankaus: *nice|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mango joe: or QJ@D to 4|pg||

nt|andybe: but they played 16 in 100 mins in open room very fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 8-card suits on S as well as N|pg||
nt|xenya: Australia won 12 imps on 52 when they made 3N in the other room|pg||
nt|mango joe: another flat hand it seems with 4 of either major making|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  perhaps it went fast at the end and he did not pitch all his diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if 3NT is a 4-level minor pre-empt, or a flawed solid suit?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: meanwhile Ausies consolidating further and are now 42 imps +|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: in the old days it was a running suit, but time has changed.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: hemant jalan  , leads alpha    75-0|pg||

nt|mango joe: E/W likely to reach the unmakeable 3N|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzat: 8 boards 28..not much with the imps flowing|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  difficult for East to move on, despite his controls|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@h is on a @s finess also 7@h|pg||
nt|mango joe: who won the final Ian?|pg||
nt|ian111:  both sides can make 10 tricks in a minor|pg||
nt|ian111:  which final ?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Hemant or Scotland?|pg||
nt|mango joe: Commonwealth Games Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzat:  Hemant Jalan leads Alpha by 75-0:   Arun Jain leads Magic Eyes( thailand) by 22:   Australia leads Formidables 51-19|pg||
nt|ian111:  Hemant |pg||
mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: This is a board, wher you have to choose betwenn 5 ot 7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will show a weak 2@H and South will bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ian111:  it was close with about 8 boards to play, but ended up over 40 to Hemant|pg||
nt|mango joe: 2@H shows less than 4 points normally, its the weakest response|pg||
nt|xenya: oh 2@D was a multi? -- I must confess I wouldn't have thought of using it with this hand |pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  if North would bypass a 4-card diamond suit to bid 1NT, as many would, then pass is an option that would not work out well|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but Duncan-Gordon are pretty old-school and so retreating to clubs looks sensible|pg||
nt|mango joe: India has a lot of depth in bridge, many ggod teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: satya checking opps conv card for lead explanation?|pg||
nt|mango joe: nothing to do with the suit|pg||
nt|mango joe: surely S wont expect N to have 2 aces + Q@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: good|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|ian111:  we've seen lots of good indian teams here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  safely navigated|pg||
pc|cA|nt|suketbombi: N-s can make a game in @S due to exremely lucky lay out but not likely to be there|pg||
nt|frankaus: will need a @H switch at  T2|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mango joe: was 4@D forcing here? I think not|pg||
nt|ian111:  hard to stop, but a lack of Aces ...|pg||
nt|ian111:  3C usually FG|pg||
nt|mango joe: esp after S opens|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  there is little worse than leading a trump to cut down dummy's ruffs and seeing 3334 put down|pg||
nt|mango joe: only @C lead gives declarer a chance|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mango joe: he isnt thinking of ducking is he?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mango joe: 4@S is a good contract needs @S 3-2|pg||
nt|ian111:  might make 4S if declarer reads the S position|pg||
nt|ian111:  west has awkward choice  over 3H|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: weak no-trump in action|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and, perhaps, 4-card majors (as that is certainly Duncan's preference)|pg||
nt|ian111:  X usually = extra values|pg||
nt|mango joe: which he has one would think|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: www.hcl-bridge.com|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  or take 1NTx for a big number|pg||
nt|mrdct:  north endplayed on teh opening lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: that will suit East nicely|pg||
nt|frankaus: one of our top players (peter gill) has analysed 1000's of hands with the conclusion that 24 point 3nt should be  bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: a comon beast over here |pg||
pc|d7|nt|ian111:  they've boith chose to keep a little in reserve|pg||
nt|mango joe: a kib points out that 6@D makes but I think its very unlikely to be bid|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|mango joe: 40 imps needed in 3 boards, havent seen that before|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  a less exciting hand|pg||

nt|andybe: this should be a quick board|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mango joe: @ds 4-1 so 6@D not on|pg||

nt|mango joe: luckily he doesnt have the entries to take 2 finesses in @S|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|paulg:  when holding long trumps it is often best to lead your own long suit, rather than a singleton, to try and force declarer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he is wary about their Game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four-card support and all that - still, he is a bit thin in the high-card department|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this should play ok despite the 4-1 trump split - West will spend the whole hand being endplayed  |pg||
pc|c5|nt|andybe: should ask for attitude|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrdct:  this will be 1 or 2 down i think|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the @h pips work well for declarer though - so he should make at least 6 tricks now and where there is a 6th there si often a 7th|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: poddar through easily|pg||
nt|mango joe: this has no chance and will go 1 or 2 off depending on whether they can engineer a @C ruff|pg||

nt|mango joe: East found the best lead|pg||

nt|ian111:  could try 3NT and hope to avoid a H lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s on E or do you show a 2-suiter? |pg||

nt|suketbombi: abattle of partials here 4@D is the par tho|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  in my system, it would be 3@c to show non-strong spades and clubs|pg||
nt|mango joe: puppet|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  Duncan's bid depends on their methods after a reverse ... some play 2NT as artificial (with weak hands)|pg||

nt|mango joe: no play for this|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure about 3@D  -- but S has a difficult rebid|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mango joe: 2 1/2 maybe :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  3NT probably suggests a weak club stop|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Gordon has nowhere to go .. he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|mango joe: usually the weaker hand bids the major he doesnt have |pg||
nt|ian111:  4S by E might make on CJ lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  are the results on the web anywhere?|pg||
nt|mango joe: 9 top tricks now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that he will be all that excited by his hand anyway|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzat: see hcl website|pg||
nt|mrdct:  both 5@c and 3NT depend on the @s hook|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  this should be beaten on a club lead, as long as West does not cover the @sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  given West's poor spade intermediates, this should be easy to avoid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so much for that bet ;(|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|paulg:  this will play well with the doubleton club with north and the @d10 preventing a force|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c is much easier than 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Ian|pg||
nt|andybe: good lead but will not gain any imps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ian111:  hi |pg||
pc|d9|pc|s5|nt|paulg:  not an easy lead for East to read, although to beat the contract he has little choice about playing West for an honour|pg||
nt|paulg:  or playing West for 98xx|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mango joe: at least the @H guess was easier|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the HCL website only seems to have hte results up to round 9 of the swiss|pg||
nt|mango joe: he will know Q@S and a key card is missing so will stop in 5 probably|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzat: Aus vs Ind 1 for the silver and bronze medal.....Scotland have won the Gold Medal ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Scotland has already won the Gold medal as the top national team in the event|pg||
nt|frankaus: keep = lenght with dummy is the suggested method here|pg||

nt|mango joe: 6@C on @H guess here|pg||
nt|fugitiv: and spades|pg||
nt|fugitiv: good contract|pg||
nt|fugitiv: the south hand is worth alot more than 14 with the sharp cards, intermediates, and nice 5 card suit|pg||
nt|k ylinen: no need to guess, cause S is favorably devided|pg||
nt|mango joe: The % play in @S is to play for J to drop|pg||
nt|fugitiv: NS do not play inverted minors I am told|pg||
nt|mango joe: S has a difficult bid then|pg||
nt|fugitiv: 3nt is a bal 13-15 raise|pg||
nt|fugitiv: but Ian must like his hand too much|pg||
nt|mango joe: sure|pg||
nt|fugitiv: 2nt is a raise weak or strong I am told|pg||
nt|fugitiv: 1c is four plus (acol)|pg||
nt|mango joe: he might bid !1H|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: sorry west took a toilet break|pg||
nt|fugitiv: ah-hah!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andybe: balanced fit showing jump 13-15|pg||
nt|suketbombi: bd 38 Ausies too missed the 6@H (which does not make) so now they are in a strong position from here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mango joe: this likely to be passed|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Welcome Khaled|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|paulg:  As expected, the wild hand of board 10 was flat in 4@s-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|khaled_m: For statistics lovers 7-6 distribution is a 1 in 18,000 hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, you don't mind missing slams that don't make|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: :) depends which side you are on tho:)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|paulg:  i'm surprised west did not compete here|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: can see Aus and Ind players from open room leaving ...will let u know the result of that match|pg||
nt|xenya: methods commonly used against a strong 1N may prove ineffective against 12-14 -- as the last hand goes to show|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, the NS hands are a perfect fit - no spade wastage|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: mbv 53 here with me he is ctd|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  thanks|pg||
nt|xenya: you are more likely to have a balance of power in the latter case|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|tlc: is 2NT forcing in EW's methods here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andybe: can hardly blame N with such a defensive hand and so many points but 5NT is a big shape bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  I know partner is a passed hand, but you do have five clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: 3 boards to go|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  the play-off is only 28 boards, so should finish first|pg||
nt|paulg:  silver and bronze medals at stake, as only national teams can win medals|pg||
nt|ralfwil: board 26 looks a little bit odd - 2@h on 30 high points....|pg||
nt|frankaus: most top players methos 2NT is never to play|pg||
nt|djehuti:  no, but i believe 1@h is sometimes bid on a 3card suit in this partnership|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|djehuti:  2nt here was just natural |pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  a bidding mistake ... forgot the system|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  Duncan will probably double here|pg||
nt|fugitiv: hard to believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|fugitiv: but there you go, I'm told 2h might have been a canape overcall, like 4 spades and alonger|pg||
nt|mango joe: maybe 2N shows @cs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will compete up to 3@S on possible 3@C bid from N|pg||

mb|p|nt|fugitiv: hard to see this going off|pg||
nt|mango joe: yes good @C position|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dangerous for West to bid on, though, as pard might not have much|pg||
nt|tlc: this 2@h bid is quite a view|pg||

mb|p|nt|mango joe: 3@D 4@C 1@S 1@H it looks like|pg||
mb|p|nt|mango joe: red K1s lying well for E/W and this 25% slam will come rolling home if they bid it|pg||
nt|mango joe: he might ply @D now and @H will come back but should be able to handle that|pg||

pc|dA|nt|paulg:  this looks like another 2/1 auction where they are having difficulty limiting their hands|pg||

nt|djehuti:  board 15 wont be played?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|mango joe: which just became worse|pg||

nt|mango joe: home now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  EW have outbid their counterparts in the other room and managed to give NS the last guess|pg||

pc|d3|nt|paulg:  consolation imps for Scotland|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: brb 1 min|pg||
