mb|p|nt|stc: how many qualify ?|pg||
nt|florentin: 1st 2 teams from each group|pg||
nt|iq007: 2 out of 8 from each series|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: 2 from each group|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|florentin: there are two groups, playing in round robin stage, with first two teams from each group advancing in semifinals|pg||
nt|iq007: and there are 14 matches of 16 boards (double round robin)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|stc: so a big loss will put Atomic in a bad position|pg||
nt|stc: not best spot here|pg||
nt|florentin: will you all overcall 2C?|pg||
mb|d|nt|florentin: in OR seems West opened strong club|pg||
nt|stc: 1700 costed "only" 14, 800 in 5@c only 5|pg||
mb|2H|nt|iq007: no, 3|pg||
nt|florentin: I admit I will not|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|iq007: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvq: what about X at 3@c?:)|pg||
nt|florentin: even facing a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|florentin: some preffer 2H here with 3 cards fit|pg||
nt|florentin: rdbl showing a willing to play 2D redoubled|pg||
nt|florentin: and pass = neutral|pg||
nt|adiqadiq: AQ and taking the contract is good enough for Bogdan|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzvq: and add extra trick if he plays it:)|pg||
nt|florentin: oh, forgot that Mr. Bogdan is declarer :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzvq: there are 2 motives for bidding like this:|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: 1. some sort of part agreement (?)|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|zoridezi: dont think there is any time left for atomic to get back in the game |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|florentin: perhaps as a request from E/W|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|stc: Interesting way to win IMP : 1@d against 4@s :)|pg||
