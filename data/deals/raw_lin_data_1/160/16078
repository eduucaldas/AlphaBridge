nt|pkraunsoe: would you have doubled 5d? I would bid 5h|pg||
nt|jron: I agree w Peter, but after doubling once you tend to double automatically the 2nd time|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: and the third :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: in for a penny in for a pound|pg||
nt|pkraunsoe: :)|pg||
nt|jron: but bidding on is a lot easier seeing E cards|pg||
nt|pkraunsoe: that is right Jacob|pg||
nt|jron: at this vulnerability 5@h should at worst be on a finesse, whereas 5@D wont go many down when partner passes 5@D. But still not the easiest bid to find|pg||

mb|2C|nt|oleberg: 2@C = Standard-precision|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|oleberg: 2@D = Relay. Forcing for a round, promisses invitational values or better|pg||

nt|vugraphzwh: dbl = 4@hs|pg||
nt|pkraunsoe: in closed NS did not get A of spades.|pg||

nt|oleberg: Some would refrain from bidding because of th 4-card spade suit|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|oleberg: But the overcall actually brings the spades into the picture, as it makes it much easier for Westto make a bid, like a T-O double, on limited values|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwh: I am not able to tell you which of the two semifinals we will broadcast -- depends on the results|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|oleberg: the @D7 might be a "Trelde suit preference" for spades|pg||
nt|oleberg: Danish convention, but dubious if it apllies here|pg||
nt|oleberg: (As opposed the eigth)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: tell me about it Ole --- it seems like a nice gimmic here |pg||
nt|oleberg: When you have a lot of signal cards, low is encouraging while high-odd is for the highest suit and a high-even is for the lower|pg||
nt|jron: it applies here aswell|pg||
nt|oleberg: But you have to have some agreement about when it is on, and I don't know what agreement EW has|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Askgaard is giving this one some thoughts|pg||
nt|oleberg: But I know they play it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: after this board -- 17 boards remaining of this semifinale|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jron: It is normal to play it any time you have shown a 5c suit|pg||
