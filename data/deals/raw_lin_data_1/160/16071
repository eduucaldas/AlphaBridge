pc|d7|nt|stc: they neglected ALL RULES !|pg||
nt|florentin: "be sure you have more trumps than opponents"|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: just 3 jacks an ace and a void, not bright chances to resist|pg||

nt|vugraphzvq: i think he s not in a position to expect anything with that hand|pg||

nt|zoridezi: so EW precision @c|pg||
nt|lazcatluc: EW must work hard here for their game|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lazcatluc: if they draw 2 trumps they can only make nine tricks, 6 spades and 3 aces|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lazcatluc: well here is the 10th trick|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lazcatluc: now ruffing one heart and one diamond in E and ruffing 2 clubs in W makes the contract|pg||
pc|s6|nt|zoridezi: im a bit surprised for this 4@S to be honest|pg||
nt|lazcatluc: radu sees this and attempts to undermine the crossruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|stc: how many qualify ?|pg||
nt|florentin: 1st 2 teams from each group|pg||
nt|iq007: 2 out of 8 from each series|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: 2 from each group|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|florentin: there are two groups, playing in round robin stage, with first two teams from each group advancing in semifinals|pg||
nt|iq007: and there are 14 matches of 16 boards (double round robin)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: so a big loss will put Atomic in a bad position|pg||
nt|stc: not best spot here|pg||

nt|lazcatluc: good decision by bogdan to bid 3 clubs|pg||

nt|zoridezi: curious bid by W|pg||

mb|1D|nt|stc: In fact in OR they had a Strong @c sequence|pg||
nt|florentin: This is the last board of this clash|pg||
mb|3C|nt|florentin: Thanks to our operator, Raluca, for a neat job|pg||
nt|florentin: Thanks to Romanian Bridge Federation for the effort to broadcast|pg||
nt|stc: a phantom save in OR, but looks normal|pg||
nt|florentin: Thanks to BBO, who allow so many people to watch and play|pg||
nt|zoridezi: still W has only 16-18 so a 3@s would have been more apropriate|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: my pleasure, after this segment we ll return with another match|pg||
nt|florentin: your action, as East?|pg||
nt|iq007: 4 clubs anyone?|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|zoridezi: 4@c seems fair|pg||
nt|zoridezi: showing both majors |pg||
nt|stc: shape ok for 4@c, points :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|florentin: yes, a little shaded  but I guess Dbl would be worse|pg||
nt|zoridezi: but problems come into the play when @d will be on the lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: it is ok, if he bid 3M it is stronger|pg||
mb|5C|nt|stc: could be the much needed swing|pg||
nt|stc: W may bid 5@h now|pg||
mb|5H|nt|zoridezi: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: he-he|pg||
nt|florentin: if he pass, it is F|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|stc: this is the consequnce of 4@c, which was a light overbid|pg||
nt|zoridezi: in this seqvence he should let E to show his hand since he only did once with 4@c and nothing else |pg||
nt|florentin: perhaps West should Dbl   |pg||
nt|zoridezi: 100% the right thing|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c5|nt|iq007: why double with so much in hearts? 5 hearts seems a normal bid|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|stc: common, W is thinking at slam..., give E K@h instead of K@S and 5@h is right|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|iq007: his partner bid 4th level by himself|pg||

mc|9|nt|stc: EW very unlucky, the have 9 points A@c and KQ@s for 0 reicks|pg||
