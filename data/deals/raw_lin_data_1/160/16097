mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|an|a|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|djneill:  East Passes 1@c with an eye on the vulnerablity - that @s suit is moth-eaten|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|vugrapha1: Apologies viewers, players sat in opposite position. I will restart in 2nd board |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|djneill:  as playing  a 4-3 fit is not too good, North's 3@h should be forcing to game, just confirming the fit along the way in case South has 5@h, though one would think South would have a checkback available with 5@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  East leads a nice-looking @s but North's spots are a mood-dampener|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|vugrapha1: in the tank |pg||
pc|s2|nt|djneill:  North can count 3@c, 2@s, 2@d, 2@h for 9 minimum|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|djneill:  after the deluge of spades, the count will be rectified (lost 3 tricks, have 9) and a squeeze in @h-@d is an option that happens to work, though there is no risk in the @d finesse since West is out of @s at that point|pg||
pc|s8|nt|djneill:  there is a small clue that the @dQ is offsides -if East had @sKJxxx  @hxx  @dQxx @cAxx for example they might have overcalled 1@s|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|djneill:  nifty, East does not cash the @s, wow, there must have been a clue somewhere - otherwise it looks pretty odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  North delays the moment of truth in @d, also in case East has both the @dT and @d9 (the 8 forces the Queen)|pg||

nt|djneill:  North really wanted East to play spades, Chan made a great switch!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: apologies, lost play|pg||
nt|djneill:  that's right john it worked out very well, how often do you buy it at 2@s when the opponents have 24 HCP|pg||
nt|bucheister: most likely down one but the defense must be careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: Certainly not a text book weak two but still effective.|pg||
nt|djneill:  this 24 HCP though is a bad mesh, does not do very well in 3NT|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's 2@h response was pass/correct, and West is supposed to Pass with @h, or bid @s with @s|pg||
nt|bucheister: North might have upgraded that hand to  15 and bid 2nt and that would have led to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  mm, closer to a downgrade than an upgrade, the red Queens are as defenseless as a baby in the blitz|pg||
