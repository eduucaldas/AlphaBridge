nt|iq007: Radu Nistor is world vice-champion in individual contest for youth|pg||
mb|2N|nt|florentin: note 3C   wild action recomended after a 1c strong opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|iq007: and the pair stirbu-serpoi was 15th in the pair contest in Philadelphia this year|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvq: hoping for a 5@c or 5@d response?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: but sometimes it pushes opps in a slam they wouldn t have found otherwise:)|pg||
nt|florentin: and West perhaps would do better to bid 5C directly|pg||
nt|florentin: space consuming|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: maybe he knows the 3@c bidder:)|pg||

nt|florentin: seems makeable, as long declarer will not allow North to gain the lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iq007: they are playing gazilli|pg||

nt|lazcatluc: i like take-out myself|pg||
nt|zoridezi: 1 of the spec pointed out |pg||
nt|lazcatluc: max might make 5 now|pg||
nt|zoridezi: when u have an 1NT as opener x is going to be more like a penalty |pg||
nt|lazcatluc: he could be afraid to finesse @Hs|pg||
nt|lazcatluc: because of a possible spade ruff|pg||
nt|lazcatluc: stirbu is thinking that if his partner has Qxx of @Hs, he should play low here|pg||
nt|lazcatluc: so that his partner can play another @s in order to get his ruff|pg||
nt|lazcatluc: @S6 is not a very easy to read card, though|pg||

nt|h_karluk: too many keycards needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: N wondering if S has J10 @h maybe|pg||

nt|adiqadiq: only d and not on club lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: could be, anyways 2nd seat both vuln weak 2 discussable decision|pg||
nt|florentin: I'm told 2H = weak hand, spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|florentin: vulnerabilty might push |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|florentin: 2S a sign off bid, and 3S trying to show 2suits, I guess|pg||
pc|sT|nt|stc: N looking for trouble, and finding it|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: hard to believe N would bid like this|pg||
nt|florentin: if the bidding is true, they just neglected David Burn's rule|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: ok, 2@h was @s and 5-8 po|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stc: they neglected ALL RULES !|pg||
nt|florentin: "be sure you have more trumps than opponents"|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||

nt|florentin: South marked 6 clubs and 5 spades in North, that's why he passed, I guess|pg||
nt|stc: did S expect something like 6-5 |pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: i think he s not in a position to expect anything with that hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzvq: no, sorry|pg||
nt|florentin: 1N? or in VUL they play strong?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|stc: how many qualify ?|pg||
nt|florentin: 1st 2 teams from each group|pg||
nt|iq007: 2 out of 8 from each series|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: 2 from each group|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|florentin: there are two groups, playing in round robin stage, with first two teams from each group advancing in semifinals|pg||
nt|iq007: and there are 14 matches of 16 boards (double round robin)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: so a big loss will put Atomic in a bad position|pg||

nt|florentin: will you all overcall 2C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|florentin: in OR seems West opened strong club|pg||

nt|florentin: even facing a passed hand|pg||

nt|florentin: rdbl showing a willing to play 2D redoubled|pg||
nt|florentin: and pass = neutral|pg||
nt|adiqadiq: AQ and taking the contract is good enough for Bogdan|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzvq: and add extra trick if he plays it:)|pg||
nt|florentin: oh, forgot that Mr. Bogdan is declarer :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzvq: there are 2 motives for bidding like this:|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: 1. some sort of part agreement (?)|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|zoridezi: dont think there is any time left for atomic to get back in the game |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|florentin: perhaps as a request from E/W|pg||

mb|d|nt|andreis: always :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|florentin: yes, a little shaded  but I guess Dbl would be worse|pg||
nt|zoridezi: but problems come into the play when @d will be on the lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: it is ok, if he bid 3M it is stronger|pg||
mb|3D|nt|stc: could be the much needed swing|pg||
nt|stc: W may bid 5@h now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|zoridezi: nope|pg||
nt|adiqadiq: -9 better then slam :)|pg||
nt|florentin: 2NT by Passed Hand showing good support|pg||

nt|florentin: once North Dbled, East is free to pass or bid|pg||
nt|doncapone1: oops|pg||
nt|doncapone1: brave  Filip|pg||
nt|florentin: question for serious partnerships:   does Pass from East shows weakest hand, or 3H shows that?|pg||

nt|florentin: perhaps West should Dbl   |pg||
nt|zoridezi: 100% the right thing|pg||
