pc|d4|nt|lazcatluc: a strange decision by Serpoi holding only a semi-stop in spades and facing a partner who has passed initially|pg||
nt|stc: he doesn't want to play 3@h in a potential 4-2 fit (does 3@h promise 5 ?)|pg||
nt|lazcatluc: 4-2? i would hope not :)|pg||
nt|osvaill83:  of course it promise at LEAST 5 hearts|pg||
