mb|1S|nt|pelu: is S open for sure in 6@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: of coiurse, the overcall changes that|pg||
nt|doctorone: agree... stretching strength, but excellent structure|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|doctorone: NS should land in 3N now, likely|pg||
nt|othered1: Do NS play double shows 4+@S?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|othered1: with 1@S denying @S?|pg||
nt|henryb:  6N can be made, or 6@h with a successful heart guess|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|doctorone: yes, and 1@s would have been a negative double equivalent|pg||
nt|doctorone: I wonder what is N considering here...|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess I can make up hands where a balck game is better than 3N, but I don't know how to investigate that at this point|pg||
nt|doctorone: sure there are, Ed... But here it seems reasonable to pass|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C after the cue bid would imply a stronger hand to me.|pg||
nt|doctorone: agree|pg||
nt|othered1: Unless north has limited his hand somehow.|pg||
nt|doctorone: 5@c is playable, of course|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think 6@s is not possible|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Very, but what about 6NT?|pg||

nt|doctorone: 44 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Henry said that, sorry|pg||

mb|6C|nt|doctorone: yes, in which case there is no winning line :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: asking for @hK for grand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 6@S is almost 80% I think. Even when spades are 4-1 you make when diamonds are 3-3|pg||
nt|henryb:  Multon might try 6N -- if opener had the @hJ 6N would be a much better contract|pg||
