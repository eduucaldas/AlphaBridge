nt|granguru:  Nunes is playing as a NT hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  as he know p has 5 or even 6 @s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in italy-turkey, contract was 5@C-5 by semanta|pg||
nt|phil: a 'renaissance' in the other room|pg||
nt|granguru:  He probably thought that a @H return would not be very useful as partner with a singleton @H would have return it|pg||
nt|barnets: he is always a trick short I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to gain 14 as doubled in other room :)|pg||
nt|phil: (thats slang for 1400) :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  so if N has 2 @H W would be singleton and there is no useful discard on playing a @D|pg||

nt|ritong: for the time being he opted for @d which clearly looks the best start for the def|pg||
nt|ritong: especially the 2 when west falsecarded|pg||

nt|ritong: yes, but actually i feel it really bad for nick|pg||
nt|ritong: @d hook  boink|pg||
nt|kit: So declarer would have at best 2 hearts, 3 spades, 3 diamonds unless some pressure on East|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: If East can read the heart position, he can now set up the hearts, and declarer will be a trick short even with diamonds and spades favorable.|pg||

nt|barnets: I dont think there were any squeezes|pg||
nt|phil: that gives Fantoni a big clue to the shapes , but unfortunately the defense can now take 2@c + 1@s + 2@h|pg||

nt|barnets: give dec a second heart trick so he has  hearts 3 spades and 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|phil: true Barnet, W discards after dummy|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 hearts |pg||
nt|barnets: 3 spades and 3 diamonds|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kit: If West now supports diamonds, they might get there.  But a heart lead beats it outright on lie of cards.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|kit: Now this 4@D call surprises me.  Seems like if there is slam partner wouldn't have bid 3NT.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|granguru:  so board 6 decided the result of this round. Simulators generating 1000's of hands have discovered that the 2NT opening with 20-21 is, by far, the worst opening of all. The chances of succeding this final contract is less than half of the other |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|granguru:  openings. Opening 2NT with 18 might be a unwise system definition. I dont know.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: thanks to our hard working operator, all the commentors, spectators and organizers of these broadcasts|pg||
nt|barnets: due to lucky breaks in rounded suits|pg||
nt|barnets: south will play the @S9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and Go Canada :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  what reports recommend is to increase the 2NT opening in 1 point |pg||
nt|granguru:  so use 21-22|pg||
nt|granguru:  and 1 x 1y 2NT up to 20...many kibz says that they have done it w/o knowing about simulations|pg||
