nt|uni_dennis: France were in 6@d in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1NT relay|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|rhelle: 2@s relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2NT short @d|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c relay|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rhelle: 3@d 5-4-1-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 3@h relay|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rhelle: 4@c 4 controls (A=2, K=1)|pg||
nt|belerophon: 6@d in open room .. :(( no comment  .. :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 4@d = relay|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but Drijver overcalled 2@c there and Brink raised to 5@c immediately|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4NT = top cards in S, H ... nothing in C|pg||
nt|rhelle: and nothing in @c is what East is delighted to hear|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so far the only pair I've seen to disturb the EW bidding, so credit to them|pg||
nt|rhelle: normally the Q doesn't count in the first suit when you have 2 control cards|pg||
nt|rhelle: so East will be bemused by this ... looking at the @s AK, he expected a 4@h response|pg||
nt|rhelle: and is now reviewing se sequence, to try and see if he made a mistake ... might take a while|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm late ... I have to go. Thanks all for the company|pg||
mb|7H|nt|uni_dennis: did muller - de wijs did indeed bid 4@s on bd 31? then 11 imps to Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: ty for exp-laining tarzan :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 7@h ... amazing|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: not many pairs were in the excellent 4@s on 31|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rhelle: clearly the @sQ did count, so his 4 controls could only be the stiff @d Ace|pg||
nt|belerophon: i think in open room West was hope KQxx AKx KQxxxxx |pg||
pc|h7|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, he needs trumps to break, and to set up @ds|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 6@d -1 the result from the OR|pg||
nt|rhelle: so no gimme|pg||
nt|belerophon: usualy trunm lead vs a big slam . 7 @h could be done , but not sure  |pg||
nt|belerophon: trump|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bobholl: well if he doesn't make 7@H-1 looks nicer on these hands than 6@D -1|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 51-5 for the Netherlands so far in this set if i am correct|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
