mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|kit: And if they do get to slam, not so clear that there are 12 tricks|pg||

nt|dinos1: and @d lead will beat 6@c|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|kit: West won't be happy about bidding 3NT with a single spade stopper, but what else can he do?|pg||
nt|phil: here's an article Fred wrote in the pre-BBO days that is similar to the method I mentioned: http://bbi.bridgebase.com/articles/fg/2over13.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: North has to choose between hoping spades run (with partner having Kxxxx), or going passive and hoping South has an entry.|pg||
nt|kit: After previous double of 3NT, will Helgemo try it again?|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: on a heart lead must hop with ace|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: His king of clubs isnt' good, but the opponents don't know that.  And he does want a heart lead|pg||
nt|kit: And sometimes they run!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so clear that double asked for heart lead on this auction|pg||
nt|kit: It turns out they have a home in 5@C, but they might not have.|pg||
nt|ritong: the auction has the merit to be highly original|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you have to agree, under some rules would demand a spade lead|pg||
nt|phil: I can't ever remember doubling and wanting a spade lead|pg||
nt|ritong: not oftrn you see them run away in a new suit|pg||
nt|kit: I play that double says don't lead a spade.  Makes more sense, since would get spade lead with no double probably.|pg||
nt|phil: but there have been lots of times I've wanted another lead and wanted to send that message|pg||
nt|phil: so is double simply "don't lead a spade" or is it something more for you Kit? |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: It is don't lead a spade, listen to the auction and lead what looks right.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: On this auction, it is logical that South would have some heart stuff for the double.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem is that north wont always have the spade ace, here the dont lead meaning is clear from north holding|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: I think that experts don't double 3NT nearly often enough.  The downside is small -- if it makes, only 4 IMPs.  The upside of either a big number , getting the winning lead, or ...|pg||
nt|kit: scaring opponents out of cold 3NT, are bigger.|pg||
nt|phil: 3N doesn't get xx'd a lot either, which adds to the vig|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you missed 5@C -3 undoubled kit, and same contract doubled at other table|pg||
nt|phil: very tough for Wolpert to sit with a vulnerable spade stop and no assurance of running clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kit: Another point -- we aren't at the table, but likely West had difficulty bidding 3NT, and South may have picked up on that and judged a run was likely.|pg||
