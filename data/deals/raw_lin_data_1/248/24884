pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  as I understand it, the only thing the operator is allowed to say is, after the play is over, to confirm the number of tricks made|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h7|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: and they must confirm score because the BBO score fed directly to the web page of running scores|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: bridgemate is used only in tables NOT on vugraph|pg||

mb|p|mb|d!|nt|bjacobs:  i'd defer to Al|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: i always thought bridgemate at all tables -- but was corrected by someone i trust|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  big call here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  If East bids the 6th, we are on another big swing, one way or another|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  420 becomes 550|pg||
mb|p|nt|peyret: 5 @s |pg||
nt|bjacobs:  and if East should happen to redouble, we have the most unusual flat board|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  how would you like this to be the last board of the match at this scoreline?|pg||
nt|chick: scary thought|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  it MIGHT be East in the tank, about XX|pg||
