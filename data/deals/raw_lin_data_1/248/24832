nt|ehsana: Thanks all..especially ones who want Zia to make games all the times :) bye all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: apologies if already announced --- there will be an open room to broadcast  captain's picks of  opponent and seating right sessions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how long we wait for that to begin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reliable spy tells me this is the room where we'll hear announcements|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the procedure for the round of 16 (6 sessions of 16 boards)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4 numbers 1 can pick their opponent|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: A1 from B2, B3 and B4|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: B1 from A2, A3 and A4; C1 from D234 and D1 from C234|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the open teams that is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Heya everyone welcome to the captain's meeting's table :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the remaining teams will be matched automatically with A vs. B and C vs. D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: We'll be kicking off in about 20 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Lille.12/microSite/Results.htm for results in all series|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: conditions of contest 3.1|pg||
nt|psyck: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Lille.12/microSite/SupplementalConditions2012.pdf|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the seniors play two more rounds of RR tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wrong when i tried to correct Dennis before     page 7  3 of Supplemental CoC  confirms automatic pairings after 1st pick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Dennis|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: Round of 16 in the seniors will then be 4 sessions of 16 board (top 8 of each group)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: women play 6 session of 16 as well|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but quite difficult with 3 groups|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but in the women's the teams are ranked 1 to 16 sort of and then number 1 can choose from 9-16|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: numbers 1 and 2 of each group having their picks first|pg||
nt|sga1: :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in women's teams you cannot meet teams from the same group|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: Russia can pick first (best number 1), then Sweden (2nd best number 1), then Netherlands (3rd best number 1)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but they have to calculate the VP average of the actually played matches first|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: top 5 in women's |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and best number 6, which is Australia|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so Israel did not make it there|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: seniors play 2 more rounds of RR tomorrow, then top-8 qualifies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have you taken straw poll of who Germany will select out of France, Poland, Ireland|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: results: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Lille.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: you would guess Ireland, but maybe they take on Poland|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: somehow in the results in the women's it looks like Israel made it|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: being bold in the rankings, but not sure|pg||
nt|pelu:  Germany-Ireland, USA-India, Poland-Denmark and France-NL. Italy-Tyrkey, Monaco-Canada, Svweden-Israel and Eussia-Norway :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  only My bet :):)|pg||
nt|psyck: Difficult to argue with that Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter  did you use  results from European Championship  to guess Germany's pick?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: bas, can you tell us how long we have to wait?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: start times tomorrow  30 minutes earlier than we've seen so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but set 3 same start|pg||
nt|psyck: a generation ago, Bas said in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|psyck: I have a few more grey hairs now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: R16   2 days  3 segments each of 16 boards|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 6 sessions you mean Al|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: ah, 3 per day|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Bas|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule with viewer's local timezone   http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?commentatoronly=1&order_by=event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right dennis  48 boards per day for 96 total|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and there will be no carry-overs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Veldhoven had live stream of the selection process -- i haven't heard of any livestream from Lille :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Live stream right here... :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)    nice Bas|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each team member must play at least 1/3 of boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to qualify for overall award|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many think that is too low|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: is that 1/3 in each round?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: or each stage better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1/3  of hands in RR  and  1/3 of COMBINED boards in KO|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so don't need to play 1/3 in each KO match |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is also controversial|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: It has just been confirmed all teams are represented|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: The Ladies' draw will be held first|pg||
nt|jillan:  so holding my breath :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: The teams ranked top 8 can play any team from 9-16 with the exception that they cannot rematch a RR match/ force that down the line|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Russia - Denmark|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Sweden - Australia|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Netherlands - Italy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Brazil - Austria|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: USA - Poland|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Scotland - France|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: China - England|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Turkey - Indonesia|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: The seating rights are now being determined|pg||
nt|jillan:  phew just made it :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: USA was left with an awkward decision between Poland, France and England|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though i think France isn't as strong here as they can be|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Seating rights now being decided|pg||
nt|thorvald: While we wait - I think its is interesting that neither north dropped the @d9 at this last board, are there a situation, where it can be wrong to drop it ?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: true, but one of those things that you need to be aware of|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and at the end of RR you miss things|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: like those chances to decieve a declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: Zia mentions a few falsecards with 9 in his book if i remember right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9 well documented long before Zia was author|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Open teams now|pg||
nt|caruga: spaghetti,buon appe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: including but not limited to Mike Lawrence's  "Falsecards"   and  Terence Reese in ?? Master Play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: I'll leave explaining the technical details to people who have read the Conditions :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :(   i thought Bas would mention the seating rights|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i think the website will show them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Germany - Ireland|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: USA - India|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: Denmark - Poland|pg||

nt|Vugraphzay: Those are the draws, seating rights about to be determined|pg||
nt|psyck: yes no surpises there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i waffled with  Germany's choice|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in QF an A-B match will play a C-D match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Daily Bulletin will post lineup of vugraph matches|pg||
