nt|uni_dennis: and 4@h should go -500|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: the closed room is 5 board behind, so this table remains open |pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   3 down|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|hedyg:  thanks Harold,great job :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|uni_dennis: maybe NS play MultiLandy here|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: thanks Hedy..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so 4@d shows 1 Major|pg||
nt|ady: thx Harold and specks|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: and 4M would show Major + minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 4NT will also make, nice bid|pg||
nt|serhat: wow great bid by Helgamo|pg||
pc|hA|nt|uni_dennis: he has an extra @c|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and 5@c would also be all right, so probably just a 1 imp swing, maybe 2|pg||
nt|ady: overall  Netherlands  a good set|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@c could suffer @h ruff|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|mc|12|nt|uni_dennis: so this might well be a big result for Monaco then|pg||
nt|ady: yes  possible|pg||

nt|tez: 4@h p p 4nt|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: brink was used a transfer -- seems strange place to use that|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4NT bid found at both tables|pg||
nt|rhelle: really a tremendous biud|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   multi-landy over 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that IS interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks to many for that clarification|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another treatment is   to use 4@C/@D to show @H & @S    but either 1 shows equal length and the other unequal  OR  one shows pref for @S the other better or equal @H|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
