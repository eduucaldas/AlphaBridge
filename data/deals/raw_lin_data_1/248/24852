nt|ahollan1: round 5  begins in about 1 hour|pg||
nt|eamongall: this is a tough board to bid to slam |pg||
nt|eamongall: needs 2 3-2 breaks ..so only 50% |pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|idc: Well, a surprise gain of 13 IMPs for Ireland on Bd 25|pg||
nt|idc: 4@h going -1 here looked normal|pg||
nt|idc: In Open room, E-W reache 4-4 fit 4@s instead, which also seems likely to go -1|pg||
nt|idc: but Smirnov underlead @dA at trick 4 to give Garvey a guess - he got it right and then could pitch a loser|pg||
nt|idc: So Germany's lead now down to just 7 IMPs (though a likely swing for them to come on Bd 28)|pg||
nt|idc: Last hand in this room - can I thank the WBF and organisers in Lille for letting us broadcast|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|idc: and our Vugraph operator and my colleague Eamon for bravely covering most of the match by himself|pg||

nt|eamongall: ah no ian arrived before halfway I think |pg||
nt|idc: 2NT here was modified Jacoby - usual for it to promise 4-card support but I guess they play 3 is possible|pg||
nt|idc: here it may have made it too tough to find their other 8-card fit, and that looks like a better suit for slam purposes|pg||
nt|eamongall: is this a possible slam hand .. from a bidding point of view|pg||
nt|eamongall: some wind here in Dublin but not like yesterdays storm |pg||
nt|idc: I guess 6@h needs 3-2 breaks in both majors, 2 @c ruffs make 12|pg||
nt|idc: Two 3-2 breaks means it is somewhere around 50%, so no shame not to reach slam|pg||
nt|idc: In the Canada-Monaco match, Helgemo/Helness have reached 6@h here|pg||
nt|idc: BTW, Canada still ahead there, by 15 IMPs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|idc: Even 4@s needs some thought of course - if both majors 4-1 it may even go down sometimes|pg||
nt|idc: Worth noting that slam becomes a slightly better prospect if even game might go down on bad breaks|pg||
