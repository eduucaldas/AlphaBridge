nt|bjacobs:  who knows what you should do in 1st seat as South ... depends on your methods I suppose|pg||
nt|warrens:  what is happening? a short break?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  they are so weary after 2 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzbd: yes, short break....|pg||
nt|warrens:  good morning (afternoon).  |pg||
nt|warrens:  pretty much a straight 50-50 slam here|pg||
nt|warrens:  and, yes, good evening to some of you :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bjacobs:  good start for the Canadians|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I guess South might follow up with a splinter, and it will be off to the races|pg||
nt|warrens:  Fantoni has to decide whether to come in now at unfavorable.  if so, 2NT or 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  2NT gets his shape across, but 3@D is much better for the lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I guess he didn't see the point at this vulnerability, learning from the previous board|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  Now, will South show the void?  That's the big question|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  If he doesn't , they stay out of the slam|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  this is a terrifying hesitation|pg||
nt|warrens:  I hope N isn't thinking S has 3 key cards and a void|pg||
nt|siladen:  yes, what a bid from S|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  of course against 7@H, East has to find the lead|pg||
nt|fluff:  in kantar Bible on RKC, this shows a void in a higher suit :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  wait, only 2 available with a void|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  East could potentially visualize the diamond void, but to think that West has @CA when he has all those cards!|pg||
nt|warrens:  so, does he think Demuy bid this with AKxxxx, Qxxxx, --, Ax.  If he had that hand, wouldn't he just bid 5NT, allowing room for more exploration?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  If a diamond is led, the 3-0 trumps creats a bt of a problem though ... might need to pick up the entire spade suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  many pairs play 5NT=2KC's + void and 6m=1/3 with a void|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|nt|warrens:  of course, if L'Ecuyer bids 7@H, is a @C lead obvious?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|bjacobs:  Can't fall back on a trump!|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  OK, so does declarer need to guess the spades here?  That's the big question|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  He will play a trump, and a count of the tricks will show him that he has to, I think|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|fluff:  dont know if he will guess, but he needs to guess :)|pg||
nt|cc469: N clearly thought on this auction that his partner had a mite more than 8 points|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|warrens:  declarer needs to ruff 2@C's in his hand and either one or zero @S's.  this isn't easy once trumps don't break|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  So that's that|pg||

nt|warrens:  Demuy makes a nice play here with the @C 8, giving declarer a choice of finessing or taking the ruffing finesse.  Nunes wasn't fooled, since he knew that S started with only 4 red cards|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bjacobs:  Not so much the ruffing finesse as playing for the suit to be 3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  right, since he would also play the 8 from 8xx in that position|pg||
