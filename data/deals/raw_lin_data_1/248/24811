nt|Walddk2:  Also welcome to Barnet Shenkin|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi all|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  was this the slow of fast Norwgian pair?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  thank god|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@C is an easy task|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  not sure what Fantoni will open: there aren't firm rules for 8-card fits|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  suit|pg||
nt|mayors:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/cc/OpenTeams/Norway/Charlsen-Hoftaniska.pdf|pg||
nt|granguru:  has 6@C a chance?|pg||
nt|granguru:  only after @SK lead, I think|pg||
nt|granguru:  but E should lead a normal @Hhonor|pg||
nt|barnets: cant eliminate not enough entries|pg||
nt|barnets: even on @SK lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  After @SK lead there is a possible endplay if there is entries enough to eliminate reds|pg||
nt|granguru:  and play small @S|pg||
nt|barnets: west still has a diamond to get out|pg||
nt|barnets: or a heart|pg||
nt|granguru:  in any case is a completely unexpected lead..|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  My guess is that Fantoni will NOT open 2@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  F is going to opoen 1@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  unlimited opening|pg||
nt|granguru:  S is going to bid 1@H =4+@S 0-11|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes Roland is right|pg||
nt|granguru:  S will not have that opportunity, given e cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Funny, I saw a hand with a suit of 765432 in some previous set, and here is another of them (with the AK on top)|pg||
nt|granguru:  what would you bid after N 1@C?|pg||
nt|granguru:  with E cards?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  1@H I think|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bjacobs:  Mostly it seems best to get the 5-card suit shown ... you may be able to back in later with a double to get the other suits into the game|pg||
nt|granguru:  assume you play Ghestem or Michaels|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs:  But East chose the double - that's what makes horse-racing|pg||
nt|granguru:  So S can still transfer |pg||
mb|r|mb|3H|nt|granguru:  XX =  +|pg||
nt|granguru:  8+|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|granguru:  3NT was also easy to make|pg||
nt|barnets: this makes it difficult for n/s to gauge exactly 11 tricks|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: ed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: well judged|pg||
nt|granguru:  the opening is 14+ so the redouble is, with some exceptions, FG|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  E/W hope that they have caused enough damage with their heart bids, and that N/S are in the wrong contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  So passing out 5@H is IMO clear-cut|pg||

nt|bobholl: well done by the monegask's now try to make it and the @S lead helps enorm|pg||
nt|barnets: so east thought @SK in dummy not sure why|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe 2N suggested it|pg||
nt|barnets: and tried a sneaky lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  no, I think the trump lead is called for|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  classic auction:  declarer shown 2 suits, dummy has mediocre support for one of them|pg||
nt|ritong: and east has reasonable @c opposition|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  to me this is one of the 3 situations where a trump is called for|pg||
nt|bobholl: if an auction call for a trump lead do it regardless your possesion in trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: calls|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  the other two are:  need to be passive, and opponents sacrificing and you have all the high cards|pg||
nt|barnets: there is one situation a trump is called for------- when its right|pg||
