nt|kingcur: although he's lately been playing considerably faster than his repute leads to expect|pg||

mb|d|nt|andersk: alot of long major suits last 2 set|pg||

nt|kit: I'm not so sure about this queen of spades shift -- seems like if declarer is 1-8-3-1 it could cost the contract.|pg||
nt|andersk: I think we owe the world champs som respect for their desisions...sometime 5@H even make and 5@C makes too (just give helness another @D instead of a @H) |pg||
nt|kit: I don't like 5@H directly either -- for all you know, West might have been about to pass 4@H doubled.|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kingcur: but NS do also have a normal splitting @S fit...that might play a lot better|pg||

nt|kit: North will be very slam interested after the 1@S opening.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rhelle: 1NT = GF relay|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: what can North discover at this point?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rhelle: everything :)|pg||
nt|kit: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s is relay, asks for controls|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|d|nt|rhelle: 4@c = 3 controls; an ace and a king or 3 kings|pg||
nt|kit: Now North will be happy, as he will be expecting a diamond lead.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@d = relay; dbl gives them extra space|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kingcur: with AKxxxx Kxx xxx K, this would be a great 7@S, so it's vital to locate honor cards of S hand...and Tarzan can do that|pg||
nt|rhelle: the have modified the relays a bit; I'm not sure what this exactly means|pg||
nt|kit: that would be more than 3 controls|pg||
nt|rhelle: no, no ... queens start to count as well|pg||

nt|rhelle: ive got to go ... Al, can you help out?|pg||

nt|kingcur: thx Rob!|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kingcur: De Wijs in the tank for several minutes already|pg||
nt|kit: Unfortunately for N-S, West has easy heart lead, and slam then has no real play.|pg||
nt|thorvald: Obey your partner or lead @HK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kingcur: does he have more than the @C finesse here?|pg||
nt|kit: Partner's double of 4@D isn't a command -- it is a suggestion.|pg||
nt|kit: He doesn't have club finesse even|pg||
nt|kingcur: ah, heart lead settles that|pg||
nt|kingcur: was assuming @D lead, but W has some reason to disagree on that request|pg||
nt|kit: Even ruffing finesse in clubs won't help him here.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: About all he can hope for is 6-1 heart split|pg||
nt|kingcur: Rob already mentioned they changed their system here. Maybe some misunderstanding then|pg||
nt|kit: I guess is an opponent has Kx in clubs and is void in spades|pg||
nt|kingcur: if S gave the correct info on his honor cards, N should know the slam was poor|pg||

nt|cc469: ... wonder what it means?|pg||
nt|phil: whatever it asks for, I think Nunes has it|pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart lead you need west to have @SA sing and @CKXX or @CKX|pg||

nt|ahollan1: USA over Sweden by 16  other matches still playing|pg||
mb|1C|an|strong|nt|phil: that seems completely dependent on your methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  probably 2@S 2NT asking side feature would have helped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|1N|an|!c!h or !s!d|nt|barnets: really ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = CRASH  2 suits same shape|pg||
nt|barnets: wow --- nice|pg||
nt|phil: and theres a balance between finding out what partner has and telling the opponents what to lead against your slam or game|pg||
mb|2H|nt|phil: ending with a flourish|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = game force  5+@S|pg||
nt|granguru:  agree but at this level players rarely lead wrong...|pg||
nt|granguru:  even we have seen some great swings on slams and grands because of the right/wrong lead|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D pass/correct ???|pg||
mb|4C|nt|barnets: West played 7@S on a heart lead|pg||
nt|barnets: this took away all the guessing involved|pg||
nt|phil: note this isn't a great grand, but a heart lead solves your problems|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bobholl: than even aunt truus (dutch) makes it |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w  will do well to flatten board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if i'm right about 3@D [pass/correct]  it does imply good @H support|pg||
nt|bobholl: they won't i fear|pg||
mb|5S|nt|barnets: at leat e/w have rightsided it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed it   3@D could also be @D with better @C|pg||
