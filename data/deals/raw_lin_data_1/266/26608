Shivam Shah has quite a few points and might have considered bidding more than 2@d, but the free bid shows some values and if his partner is minimum then it will always be enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  i can understand double on this hand ... Opposite a passed hand Shiv is only looking to compete the part-score|pg||
nt|paulg:  so getting both majors into play with his only likely call|pg||
nt|paulg:  opposite an unpassed partner I expect he would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  so EW know that 3NT is unplayable, but what about 5@d?|pg||
nt|paulg:  we can see it's hopeless too|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps West will raise to 4@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  even passing, given what people open, is not ridiculous|pg||

nt|vugraphzch: well done|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|paulg:  the lack of a 1@s bid from North is perhaps significant .. means that East has 2+ spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  and heart finesses likely to fail|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  and, if you raise to 4@d, then partner will never raise missing all the trump honours|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|paulg:  a very well-judged auction|pg||

nt|paulg:  if they don't cash the clubs|pg||
nt|paulg:  so the pure 50% chance is not that bad a choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzch: well he can duck to West which means that they can't play spades immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the other hand, the four clubs in dummy does restrict their discards even if they do not cash the clubs|pg||
nt|paulg:  even if West switches to spades, are you ducking?|pg||
