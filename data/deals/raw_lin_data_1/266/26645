nt|petergill: 2NT Lebensohl|pg||
nt|petergill: Beale are the 2nd seeds. Magee - Strong won the Pairs event yesterday|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C forced, more or less|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass by North = long clubs, weak, about 0-6 pts|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Jill asked about the dble|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: evazive answer from Alex|pg||
nt|petergill: West's Dbl = penalty, I think, though what Alex Czapnik thinks of the Dbl  - we will find out soon|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Martin at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2M = 5 in the suit plus a minor is a very popular gadget in Europe. It certainly can score the odd success. however it suffers from numeour shortcomings, which in the opinion of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some (no prtze for guessing one example) easily outweigh its potential advantages|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "numerous"|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think Alex will reply that he's not sure - it could be "pass if clubs is your minor" or it could be "outright penalty" - this requires prior agreement which often has not been ...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: much less likely to buy the contract than the foe are|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: Once 3@C got doubled, Magee decided to try 3@S - I think 2@s (or Pass) the previous round might be a better call|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|petergill: Marshall - this hand is not one of the bad hands for the 2@H opener! :) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: basically 2M tells the opponents to bid a game they might otherwise stay out of, and also tells thenm how to make it  (not here of course, but all too often)|pg||

pc|d5|pc|h3|pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: I think her aim is to escape for minus 800|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|petergill: Marshall, there is a word for such players, do you know what that word is?|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 23 - 6@S was poor - not only is 4-1 spades (quite likely on the bidding) almost impossible to handle, but the club finesse was needed|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: N has taken leave of ... the 4 level. how can N force to 5 level all by himself? Cuebid and then RKC after a signoff is just too much. why did he bother to cuebid at all?|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's unusual thing is they play "REO count" where an odd pip shows an odd number of cards and an even pip shows an even number, with hi-lo cancelling the message|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Because they are 15 VPs behind the opponents and this is the last match, North is doing what humans do - which is to try for things that aren't there - to try for too much|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|petergill: but human brains tend on autopilot to think "state of the match" miracle needed and stuff like that|pg||
