nt|ahollan1: or is vanProoijen too strong even opposite passed hand|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|4H|nt|uni_dennis: Verhees could open 2@s weak, but he does not|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@c 2+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 1@c also with 4@d-2@c if balanced|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: i don't think i've ever seen them open 2@S with 5-card suit|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: many of the other Dutch pairs do|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is the ONLY weak 2-bid in Ultimate Canape system|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i'm sure De Wijs will open some in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that wouldn't surprise me at all :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: looks like quite a safe contract this, with @c finesse on|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: declarer has a choice of finesses|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: as he only has one entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver may help here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but @h finesse requires exactly Kx onside, @c finesse just @cK in any lenght|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: @d now from S likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or continue @H|pg||
