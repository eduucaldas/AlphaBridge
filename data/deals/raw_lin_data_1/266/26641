mb|1S|mb|d|an|10+|nt|petergill: 3NT is OK but 4@H looks unlikely to make|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|d|nt|petergill: 4@C splinter|pg||
mb|4D|nt|petergill: south might bid 5@c after North's club-showing Dbl|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@D cue bid (= control bid) - despite the wasted @CK, the good 6 card suit and ace are great values, |pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|petergill: There's a case to play "switched splinters" (4@D = club shortage and 4@C = short @Ds), especially  when the opponents are not vul, to prevent this sort of scenario|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: As the cards lie, Alex C will make 5@H, but he properly gives the hand full consideration at Trick 1 to make a good plan |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|petergill: He's safe if a spade is ruffed|pg||
nt|petergill: because 2 diamonds go on the spades later|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|petergill: Alex Czapnik no doubt worked that out at Trick 1, before taking the spade finesse|pg||

nt|petergill: Alex has played a lot of rubber bridge, is a good card player|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|petergill: Stan Klofa is 50th in the "all-time most masterpoints won in Australia" list at http://www.abfmasterpoints.com.au/mpsbynational.asp?rep=top50all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|petergill: In my opinion, Dbl then 2@D should be about 17-20 points, too strong to overcall 2@D|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|d2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|petergill: so North might have ventured 2@H or 3@D, perhaps leading to 3NT, which might well go down|pg||

pc|d4|pc|h7|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT by North on a @H lead would make, but 3Nt by South, after @H!0 lead is ducked, loses out to a dynamic @SK switch, possibly too double-dummy to be real?|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|petergill: North found his partner with 5 controls, ace = 2 and king = 1, so he tried 6NT, which is ricky, lacking any high cards in partner's suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: welcome to David Beauchamp :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: Allnhe needed was a heart finesse (or friendly lead), spade finesse and a bit more|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d6|mc|11|nt|petergill: A weakness of strong club systems is the auctions after responder shows a five card minor in response to a strong club - you lack space to find out enough info|pg||

nt|petergill: Stan the man had a different approach |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|3D|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: If you use full relays, you still can have big problems on those auctions, to do with which suits contain the high cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: strange contract|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: 4@H might look like a practical bid, but 3@H surely is a better bid|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: 4@H survives when there are 2 trump losers - but this time there are 3 truimp losers|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|s5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|petergill: A bit unlucky. Without @H10, East would have bid 3@H, I think. |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@s might be troubled by the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: we will have results from the closed next board|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: 3NT will make as the cards lie, but might be a bad contract on @d leads on different layouts|pg||

pc|c4|pc|d6|nt|petergill: His jump was affected by being a passed hand - I prefer 3@H to Dbl, given the huge disparity in my major suits|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c5|pg||

nt|beauch:  yes i wouldnt sit 3nt :0|pg||
nt|petergill: there could ba many reasons for not opening then bidding 4@h  eg. weak heart suchs as jack to 8 hearts, or a void|pg||
nt|beauch:  well 3H works well , pd will bid 3s- then play in 4/4 fit|pg||
mb|1H!|an|denies 4 s|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|beauch:  yes i agree with original pass|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|beauch:  east has a good hand and isnt sure who to trust here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: Bd 14: so the 4-6 shape happens to match the hand but is not 100% certain unless agreed prior to the game, and surely almost no pair has that many  agreements in practice?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@H 10-14 4+ @Hs not 4 spades, playing Moscito|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|beauch:  expect hans/ nunn have it documented!|pg||
