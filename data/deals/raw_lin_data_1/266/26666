mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sailior1: well I cant pronounce S's name but we'll see his bidding skills in this hand|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|sailior1: is he a newcomer to the team Julian?|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  Filip Kurbalija in partnership with Tim Rees were regulras in the team 3-4 years ago, if not further back than that|pg||
nt|sailior1: thx|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the current partnership is new for this season|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at least only 50 a time |pg||
nt|sailior1: yes the trick will be not to get into game - hard in this format|pg||
