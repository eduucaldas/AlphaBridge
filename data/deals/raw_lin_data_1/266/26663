mb|1D|nt|mug: would have made with good viewing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1C is 2+|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@h shows hearts, though|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: so clubs may not be the final denomination|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: at the other table 1@c showed clubs and so did 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: so no other final denomination was considered|pg||
nt|mug: now Osborne can ask, probably with 2@S|pg||
nt|mug: if Hinden shows 4@H plus shortage he can revert to clubs|pg||
nt|mug: we don't have the play from the CR|pg||
nt|dburn: we have some of it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mug: diamond lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: a club was led, and declarer drew two trumps|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mug: Osborne splinters himself with 3@S, which didn't impress Hinden much|pg||
nt|dburn: then played @sA and @sQ, covered and ruffed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 2@H showed four trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: he was in pretty good shape now, but if the record is to be belived the next move was the king of hearts from dummy|pg||
nt|mug: trying to ruff the hearts good and ruff two diamonds in the short hand |pg||
nt|mug: except he'd already drawn two trumps|pg||
mb|5H|nt|dburn: West may bid 5@h as a final effort -|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still has a bit much to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but whatever he wants Hinden hasn't got it|pg||
nt|mug: ok, intending to ruff one diamond and park the other on the long heart in the CR|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|mug: the trouble with 5@H was it didn't bring clubs into the game|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble with this is that, being in dummy after trick one, declarer may play a heart to the queen|pg||
nt|mug: that too|pg||
nt|dburn: I think 3@s had taken clubs out of the game as a trump suit in any case|pg||
nt|mug: I didn't like that bid either|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|dburn: and they dealt her a real slam as a reward|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mug: I think Osborne will set diamonds and RKC to 7@D now|pg||
nt|mug: or even 7NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I guess a grand on 3-2 diamonds is just about percentage|pg||
nt|mug: if he can locate @CK that's 13 tricks without ruffing anything if diamonds behave|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|dburn: but 7@d has some chances on a trump coup perhaps|pg||
nt|dburn: if South has the stiff @dJ or @d10|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, from West's point of view it's odds on to bid the grand - partner might have the @dJ|pg||
nt|mug: he just want to get 4NT out in an auction where Hinden won't take it as non-forcing|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|dburn: running out of room|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: last chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: Hinden implied the two bullets now anyway|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|mug: 5NT is probably Josephine, with 6@C showing one of the top three|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|dburn: I think without the double the sequence was supposed to be 3@c-3@h (no major) - 3NT (five spades and four hearts)|pg||

nt|paulg:  I should know their system better as I played it twice last month, once with Punch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another way of showing that is to play the Smolen convention|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the @h9 is probably from shortage, Peterkin will probably win the @hK and lead spades from his hand|pg||

nt|Sheila A:  He needs a 10th trick from somewhere and it doesn't look like it'll come from @h|pg||
