nt|ahollan1: 4@H sets @C    4@S says bad hand in context|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but you still need to guess if west has @sQ (squeeze) or East (finesse)|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ask trump queen |pg||
nt|szalay: so 1st flaw is: we cant evaluate what do we have opposite shortness 2nd one: very tough to know good interiors|pg||
nt|szalay: btw Becker-Rubin had 2 bad slam boards at 1983|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 6@c showing @dQ + @cK i suppose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: calling that "flaw" implies non-relay systems DO answer those questions|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: now N can picture @s xxx @h xx @d QJxxx @c Kxx and S needs something extra (denied @hK i believe)|pg||
nt|szalay: and exactly that has happaned: Italians could bid good slam (long suit had good interiors), they couldn't|pg||
nt|szalay: btw probably that was the best played BB final, I suggest to all of your buy and read that book|pg||
nt|szalay: (I'v read 5 times, may be more:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: south did make a positive sound, so likely to have @sQ i think|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with only some Jacks he might not have made a positive sound: @s Jxx @h Jx @d QJT9x @c KJx ?|pg||
nt|szalay: generally spiral scan is a good improvement, we play it as well. but sad thing that we dont have a bid that say: GENERAL grand slam try (all bids are asking there)|pg||
nt|szalay: to be honest he needs J of ! for good grand as well|pg||
nt|szalay: J of @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  25[4@HE=]  Bakkeren pushed to 5@H|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: many pairs play that when partners asks for trump Q, that when you show the Q you also show your side Kings|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and usually you bid the King you have or it shows the other 2 kings|pg||
nt|szalay: without J or T: 37%, with T slightly above 50%, with J its 63% for 5 running @Ds|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so 6@c would be either @cK or both the @sK and @hK here for instance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen anyone on vugraph using  this or the other 2 -- but it makes a lot of sense|pg||
