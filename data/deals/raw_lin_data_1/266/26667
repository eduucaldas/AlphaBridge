nt|idc: A rare situation (slam try after 1M - 2M) but fertile ground for conventional treatments|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dburn: apparently they do|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: a little surprised that South didn't have (or choose to use) one|pg||
nt|mug: they do according to their CC, I think Hinden just forgot she was a passed hand|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|mug: so Osborne didn't try, facing at most a bad 8-count|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|mug: 2@S presumably a weak jump shift|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: indeed|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: not a lot of ink on the Stephens-Wilkinson card, but weak jump shifts are there|pg||
nt|idc: 3@c making for N-S it seems|pg||
nt|mug: declarer has only five obvious losers, but can he control the hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: if they try to force him, he may just take two hearts and six trumps|pg||
nt|mug: one possibility is to trot out three rounds of hearts immediately, reserving the option of ruffing with @SK if the defenders continue to force|pg||
nt|mug: but the defence can take a late ruff|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mug: or he could just play a diamond up|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure this will do, though|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting that E-W play weak jump shift over 1@d which showed 5+ card suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|idc: I can see it working well after a 1@c opening which is what they open with their 12-14 bal hands|pg||
nt|mug: I think diamond up was the only winning line|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|dburn: now the defence can get a heart, a heart ruff, two diamonds and a spade to go with the first trick|pg||

nt|mug: this wouldn't have done any good even if spades had divided|pg||
mc|7|nt|idc: The other table have reached Bd 17 - Sime seems to have forgotten Drury just as Hinden did|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|capercliff:  goodness|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Acol style, major before minor|pg||
nt|ady: that was the problem with 3@H    west unable to bid 3NT    though 3NT   also not guaranteed   was down in CR|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: David can lecture all of us|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT went down at trick 1 at the other table, when declarer covered @H10 lead|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|capercliff:  5@d doesnt look right with 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hinden had so many 10's to choose from. @C10 would have been better|pg||
nt|capercliff:  I am told Steel has more caps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|capercliff:  but Rex Anderson might have the record|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about Mesbur-Fitzgibbon from Ireland?|pg||

pc|dT|pc|h3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: if East plays 3NT    can make on a club lead   1 club 1 spade  4 diamonds and 3 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have to agree with Cliff. It seems silly to play the hand in 5m with two balanced hands and stops everywhere|pg||

mb|p|nt|mug: looked like a spot of ping-pong at the end if the play is to be believed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|idc: On 19, Sime raised 1@s to 2@s and that got past both E & W|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: transfers over 1@c|pg||
nt|mug: East was fixed and West was vulnerable|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: you'd expect West to balance the fit auction 1@S-2@S-Pass|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mug: but East wouldn't necessarily convert to 3NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: all the same a steal for England|pg||
nt|idc: This lead could be from HT9x or the actual holding|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|idc: A good hand for that method, since West faced a guess|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer may have done in his ninth trick by misguessing|pg||
nt|mug: unlucky play of @HJ but normal I think, declarer doesn't really have the control to play low and lead towards @HJ later|pg||
nt|dburn: but if the queen were onside, he could lead to the jack later - though his entries and his timing may be too fragile for that|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks likely|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: better not try the dreaded smooth duck|pg||
nt|idc: South may face pressure now on the run of the red suits|pg||

nt|eamongall: running scores|pg||
nt|mug: I don't believe Osborne really tank ducked|pg||
nt|dburn: not so much that - he can be endplayed anyway, but declarer won't play that way|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks as though he may get endplayed|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|nt|idc: Agree, if you hesitate in that situation you just have to win|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mug: yes if you have the ace of course that is Ian :)|pg||
nt|idc: Heh, I've played against a few defenders like that too :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mug: of course hesitating with nothing is an infraction|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|dburn: this will allow South to get out with a diamond|pg||
