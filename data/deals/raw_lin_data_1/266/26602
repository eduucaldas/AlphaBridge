nt|Paulhac:  The majority thought that Michaels was the problem|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C Gazzilli, 11-15 with clubs or any 16+. After interference, 3@C is natural 8+|pg||

nt|Walddk2: even|pg||
nt|smoller:  Is 4@H worth while, when West has shown a strong NT (including heart stopper(s)?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe it was North|pg||

nt|warrens:  strange as this might be, it could be either one|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is not for children|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d3|nt|warrens:  when North gets in, a @D will force East to pitch or get tapped out|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: @h lead not easy for East|pg||
nt|mutton: he was on the money on the previous hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: north showed some @c length on this auction, so @c lead not that attractive|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: *me|pg||
nt|mutton: good bid , good method|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: they (we) normally play after 2-suiters that the first free bid shows fit for the first suit that comes next|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: here it would be @ds first, but since 4@h is the first game 4@c shows @h-fit and 4@s would be @d-fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzch: and thanks to the LMBA (Chris Duckworth) and EBU (Dawn Mertens) staging the event|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: another big score on bd 4 as Paske-Robertson played in 3NT instead of 4@s and went 3 off after @h lead taken by the Ace|pg||

nt|mutton: but even then|pg||
mc|13|nt|vugraphzch: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and i'm sure 4@c does not guarantee 4+ support, but can be a high card raise with 3 as well|pg||
nt|mutton: well lets hope for a recovery tommorrow from england |pg||
nt|mutton: and it has to be said the dutch pair played well|pg||
nt|vugraphzch: we'll be back here at the LSE in Islington at 10.00 (GMT) 11.00 ECT tomoroow|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if North had bid 4@s over 4@c east might have gone to the 5-level|pg||
nt|mutton: yes you are right dennis|pg||
