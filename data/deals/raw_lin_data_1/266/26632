nt|szalay: but 1 of the (strong, neapolitan club) sys of Aces was Orange Club as well, am I right?|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|szalay: 'the probably the best beer'?|pg||

nt|vugraphzba: paulissen did not alert 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: already took is pass card out, but now reconsidering|pg||
nt|szalay: the reason is behind of it, gives them more room to find a major fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: and alerts now|pg||
nt|psridhar: Dennis you have alerted 2@h in bbo ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Jansma alerted 2@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: yes, but i can't read the explanations|pg||
nt|szalay: to play this kinda switch bids or xfers have ups and dons as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: jansma did alert yes|pg||
nt|szalay: up is what I mentioned, bad thing that |pg||
nt|vugraphzba: and he wrote something, but it's out of my sight|pg||
nt|szalay: 1, gives THEM more room as well|pg||
nt|szalay: 2, if somebody forgets it: quite expensive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzba: paulissen wrote something about 1@d 1@s pass 2@h and their other bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Ton Bakkeren asks Paulissen what his pass means, but Paulissen just shrugs his shoulders indicating no clear agreements|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 3@c can be set 500 but EW have a @h fit that promises game bonus and dont know yet the game doesnt make|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: the common treatment among the dutch top pairs is after 1m 1@s pass to play 2@c = @hs and 2@h = other minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: and 2@d spade raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|s5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|psridhar: i assume 2@h X showed @h|pg||
nt|szalay: Dutch players, especially this pair, aren't overagressive ones|pg||

nt|bobholl: i can't think of one :)|pg||
nt|panosk: anyway both cards will do, unless played together :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: and about a small @H|pg||

mb|1D|an|5+ or 4441|mb|p|nt|szalay: i disagree|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|szalay: East has so good trumps that very likely pd cant pass it|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: he might have bid 4@h with that card, anyway T Bakkeren made the right decn for the cards|pg||
nt|szalay: and to make opposite 12-14 bal with bad 8 loser hand is very unlikely (dont forget West passed over 3@C, so bad hand in 12-14 range yet)|pg||

nt|szalay: btw its quite interesting that Dutch colors are red-white-blue, but they r rather associated with orange and green|pg||

nt|szalay: probably this is the only one when someone speaks|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: but Jansma was in 3rd seat, so no guarantee of real opening values|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: though @d6 should be 4th best|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: if he goes 1 down, it costs 9 imps, if he makes only 5 (or 4 with overtrick)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: so if he makes it's a tie|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: in case of a tie at the end of the match extra boards will be played|pg||
nt|psridhar: he needs to play accurately to make , i guess he will|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: as the carry-over was an exact number of imps|pg||
