mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1S|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Irish EW have done well to bid 4@H|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|idc: Many pairs here play 2@s by East as natural, so 2@c is the sole cue bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Thin games are the order of the day it seems|pg||
nt|idc: Standard is to play the cue bid as forcing to suit agreement - so 3@h was just an invite|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|idc: There is a case for East just bashing 4@h but I guess he downgraded his @cK|pg||

nt|galadriel: Ah, David Greenwood opened the E hand|pg||
nt|galadriel: So, the young Scots showing great discipline |pg||
nt|idc: As 11 counts go the East hand isn't too bad - just partnership style to open or not|pg||
