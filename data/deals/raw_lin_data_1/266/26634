nt|warrens:  systemically, they always pull 2@S with a singleton, but this hand doesn't work out well for their system|pg||
nt|danilo1: not illogicall 3@C by North .. his hand is valid 1-2 tricks in @S and much more tricks in @C ... maybe rather unlycky board - not really to critysize|pg||

nt|warrens:  went down in 5@D at the other table, but 3NT has some chances here|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|danilo1: 5@D is really too much pushed, so chance for NS for some IMPs|pg||

nt|vugraphzba: looks like 5@d could have been made in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: but v Prooijen forgot to cash @dA along the way|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dimi: trump lead will kill any chances to make|pg||
nt|danilo1: expected lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: but maybe he was preparing a trump coup if W had Qxx|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think this lead will help declarer|pg||

nt|dimi: true will make now ...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dimi: will establish the @h and ruff a club|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think S might play for W to have either the @H 10 or the @H Ace with a ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: jansma again asking questions|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: this time how EW throw count if they have 5-card (@h) suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  of course, we see it doesn't matter which @H he plays right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: some pairs play the middle one of 5-cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: but BB don't have that agreement, just plain low-high even|pg||
nt|warrens:  he can afford to lose one @H to E by pitching a @S from dummy|pg||
nt|danilo1: must develop @H as long as @SA still in hand ... since this looks the only way, should make|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|d3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|warrens:  now he has to decide if he should draw one trump before playing another @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: because Frank led @d7 and not the @d9 no entry in trump suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: or not in the 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|warrens:  he wouldn't want to ruff a club and play J of @H's and have West ruff it|pg||
nt|warrens:  so, stil in danger if W is 2-3 in the reds|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: @h5 was quite a strange card in the low-high even method|pg||
nt|warrens:  still*|pg||
nt|danilo1: @S to A and discarding @S on @H early does not work because @C ruff would come to early - even when @D 2-2 ... so ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: but i'm sure Ton knows that only declarer needs info on the @h distribution|pg||
nt|danilo1: forced to ruff @C now and ruff next card = to make|pg||
nt|danilo1: *next @H|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, a @S|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|d5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|danilo1: still works now .. must play on @D 2-2 |pg||
nt|danilo1: cash @DK and ruff @C|pg||
nt|warrens:  now he can play a @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok even if E wins and plays a trump, since that will give him an entry to his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Paulissen meanwhile must be wondering what his part in this semi final is, being dummy for about the 10th time today|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's thinking, can I make it if W has 3 @D's.  I think the answer is yes if he cashes one @D and plays a @S (assuming the Q was not a falsecard)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|d2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzba: @D7 lead may be a clue|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: what would you lead from 974? not the 7 i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  some players lead the 7 as suit preference if they want a high suit returned (I do this, for example)|pg||
nt|dimi: will still make even if W ruffs|pg||

nt|vugraphzba: also saying that Ton should not falsecard his @h count|pg||

mb|5D|nt|nilsland:  according to the "Ultimate CanapÃ©"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: van Prooijen will also be surprised as to where his tricks are coming from (lr not coming from) |pg||

When I explained that my line assumed the defense had not made a mistake and that everyone else had, my critics went away.  |pg||

nt|vugraphzba: the final will be played on the 5th and 6th of January|pg||

nt|warrens:  yes, it's always hard to decide whether to play for short odds or a mistake.  I think a lot depends on how likely or unlikely the mistake is.  if it takes a perfect view of the hand to defend correctly, then playing for a "mistake" seems ok|pg||
