nt|petergill: What went wrong was: Cory thought that 3@C guaranteed an 8 card spade fit, getting muddled because opposite an opening bid or oppposite an overcall, a cue raise guarantees support|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|petergill: 4@C on Bd 7 was the right bid by Cory - 4@s being a reasonable alternative - 3@C was the problem - 3@C shows typically a very strong hand without 4 card spade support|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: an easy 4@S to finish|pg||

pc|d2|mc|10|nt|petergill: Low @d to jack makes 11 on actual layout, low to ace makes 11 if bare king in either hand - odds slightly favour the first line - low to jack - especially when the ten appears - ...|pg||
nt|petergill: but overtricks are not important at imps|pg||
nt|petergill: Next 9 board match is in about 15 or 20 minutes|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: ok i input all the boards they played in the closed...more to come soon|pg||
nt|petergill: After 3 of 6 matches, Delmonte and Berlinski are equal 1st on 62 VPs|pg||
nt|petergill: with Power team 3rd on 58|pg||
nt|petergill: Berlinski will probably take the lead after this the 4th match|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores can be found from http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/ by clicking on Results on the left, then click Victorian Congress Events on the left, then choose this event|pg||
nt|petergill: The Blaine Howe Teams is in honour of Blaine a top Aussie expert and all-round good guy, who sadly passed away recently|pg||
nt|petergill: His obituary is at http://www.vba.asn.au/vbaHome.php|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i do not think they will finish the boards in the closed|pg||
nt|petergill: the Delmonte team of Ish Delmonte, Cory Haugh, Luke Gardiner, Serhat Ozenir and Traian Chira is seeded 1. |pg||
nt|petergill: The 2nd seed is Felicity Beale's team|pg||
nt|petergill: Neither Serhat nor Luke is very fast|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Luke did not play today,,,we have a guest in the team...a very nice lady from South Africa Sharon Lang|pg||
nt|petergill: Serhat moved to Melbourne from Turkey, Sharon is from Sth Africa, Ish originally from New Zealand, Cory originally from NZ and Traian you are from ? |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I am from Romania lol|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 100% international team loooool|pg||
nt|petergill: Sharon Lang is a bridge teacher from Gauteng in Sth Africa ref http://www.gbu.co.za/teachers/teachers.html|pg||
nt|petergill: Gauteng is the province that includes Johannesburg|pg||
nt|petergill: Here's a photo of Sharon when she played for Sth African Women's Team in the 2011 World Championships http://www.sabf.co.za/international/sa_teams_2011.html|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: many thanks Peter....absolutely fantastic commentary|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Ish is watching as well and he is saying a big thank you :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 8 bds scored - just Bd 5 to scroe - the one where 4@S Ew went down one, and NS fail in 5@C due to 4-1 break, but 5@D NS is not hopeless|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: ok thats it...director took away brd 5 from the closed room|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: back in 15 mins|pg||
nt|petergill: so a 20 imp loss for Delmonte|pg||
