nt|bobholl: 4@D 3@S 3@C 1@H so need @S or @C J or squeeze|pg||
mb|r|nt|bobholl: wow business redouble i guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  anytime you can cash 11 tricks and looking for one of three things to happen for 12, it's a good slam|pg||

nt|KemperG: 16+ on the CC|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so it looks like they changed the range of their 1NT to 12-14 instead of 12-15|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: so De Wijs will probably have shown a 15+NT|pg||

nt|KemperG: 1NT in OR witj @D lead, will make|pg||

nt|KemperG: @H and then @SA @Sx|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: small defensive error, as they should have kept the 3rd @c|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but you can also say that declarer should have ducked @cA once|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: to ruff the 3rd @c himself|pg||

mb|2D|an|11-15 short !D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=11-15 HCP, 4415 minus a card  (43)15/4414/4405|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: Ultimate Canape vs. Tarzan for slam|pg||
mb|2N!|an|relay|nt|ahollan1: 2N = relay, inv+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H=non-min, 4=3=1=5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finally got one in before Harold|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: lol....|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|ahollan1: 3@C is supposed to show min  11-12|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: Al, you outpaced harold, but Muller did not agree with you|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@S = 4315|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: maybe another change in their methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i  think Muller misbid|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: rumor says he's been ill this week|pg||
nt|bobholl: bauke doesn't make mistakes (i guess) so system change|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C ask total controls  [A=2 K=1]   step 1 = 2|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: well, luckily for him de Wijs will bid to slam|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@S = 4 controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AA or AKK|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since deWijs has AAA   guess which|pg||
mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think 4N asks scanning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then i need to check notes but believe  4@S says top @C, @S, @H, but not 2nd @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they are @SK and @HK it is 7 but i guess they will, find out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 5@S confirms @CK & @HK|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: why can't it be @sKQ, @hA, @cK?|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|mb|6C!|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: i know they show top honors in the suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually -- you're right right Dennis|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: now 6@c denies 2 @s honors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: so then Muller has @hAK, @cK and @sQ|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and De Wijs knows enough, but if Muller was @sKQxx @h Axx @d x @c KQxxx grand would be on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interpretting scanning is not something i should tray at 04:20|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though not likely if he showed min.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i still think he's too good for 3@C response|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: still an imp possible|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if @s are 4-0 you could have 2 losers|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but in S you can play @s to Q and finesse 10-9 later|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: this is the last board of the set... back at 13.15 hours...|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if you start with small @S to 8 so a push i guess|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if N has KT9x you might be able to strip him down to his @ss in the end|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: after @s to Q|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so that's why Verhees played @s to Q|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
