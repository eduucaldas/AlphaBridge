mb|1C|mb|p|nt|udo: same contract ( 4S ) other room,,,,North bid 3@H  after 1 @S pass 3@D,,,,,,|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|udo: west has great cards of East,,,even 4 @S is makeable if findind @D Â´s|pg||
nt|djneill:  1N for South would have been 14+-17 so North is thinking South can have 11 any time now|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|djneill:  wow, East did it|pg||
nt|djneill:  he likes bidding those side suits|pg||

nt|djneill:  surely|pg||
nt|djneill:  if only to sac against 4@h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|udo: East shoud have 10 cards in his suits ,,so his 6 points are gold|pg||
nt|djneill:  double-fit good udo?|pg||
nt|udo: sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|udo: north knows his pard opens lite, i guess he will just pass|pg||
nt|udo: despite holding 11 points vs an opening bid|pg||
nt|udo: and south bis only 2 @H, passed over 3 @D and over 4 @S|pg||
nt|udo: and 5 @H in 4-4 fit ??  maybe expensive actually with @H 4-1 and @C 4-2  ,,,,|pg||
nt|udo: still declarer has to find the @D queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  yeah 4@s over 4@h is I think the most difficult situation for sac/pass/x decisions|pg||
