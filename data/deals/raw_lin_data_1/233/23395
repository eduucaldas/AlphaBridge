nt|ady: good 6@S CR|pg||
nt|paulg:  solid result from the Irish pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Seem to have a stable connection now fingers x|pg||
nt|mamos:  so a slam for NS   |pg||
nt|phil352:  well bid start in the other room, always nice to bid and make slam on your first board of the day|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is a pretty easy slam to bid, 5-card support and singleton opposite an ace|pg||
nt|mamos:  South splintered and North pushed to slam in CRT|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  South may bid Jacoby 2NT|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|paulg:  It is important with splinters to defined the range|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mamos:  iif you expect  two Aces for your ps splinter  North hand is very strong|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  smartly done|pg||
nt|mamos:  its  a fair shot opposite two Aces|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|paulg:  a lot of players would use a splinter in this auction to show a minimum game raise|pg||
nt|paulg:  or even sub-minimum|pg||
nt|paulg:  and put stronger raises through Jacoby|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c2|mc|12|nt|paulg:  but you can do it any way around as long as you have an agreement|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  Splinters consume so much space, that is the reason to have a solid agreement on what they so|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mamos:  this pair certainly play 2NT showing game values with Spades  still they seemed to know what they were doing|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks for n/s in diamonds as they lay|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|paulg:  1@h only promises a 4-card suit and Garvey may have a longer black suit, but limited to 16 points|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos:  not sure what dbl was here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3 hearts seems a better choice than double |pg||
nt|paulg:  the double is very aggressive ... works when partner has a 5-card black suit, but not when he is 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|phil352:  yes i'm in the 3@H camp|pg||
nt|mamos:  me too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
nt|paulg:  however there seems little reason to search for partner's 5-card suit, as he will bid it over 3@H if you have game and the 4-4 fit likely to be better anyhow|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|d7|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|paulg:  the layout is actually quite friendly with the spades breaking|pg||
nt|mamos:  he knows the shapes now|pg||
nt|paulg:  his plan is probably to play North for @s10xx and endplay South hoping he has @sKQx|pg||
nt|paulg:  but he cannot remove clubs without giving South a trump trick|pg||
nt|mamos:  i dont  think that the third round of trumps helped|pg||

nt|paulg:  NS play Acol, weak 1NT and a multi 2@d|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  EW are playing Blue Club with a strong notrump, so 4-card majors for both|pg||
nt|mamos:  this may be passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  hard to see any reason for West to bid here|pg||
nt|mamos:  none |pg||
nt|mamos:  and he agrees |pg||
nt|paulg:  although we had this discussion a couple of days ago|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yorkbeach:  hello everyone|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  when they open 1@s, you should perhaps protect with 1NT on weaker hands than most normally do|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  whereas over 1@c or 1@d, you should be stronger to protect as partner has not overcalled or doubled|pg||
nt|mamos:  on 8 upwards|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  many employ the rule that you had 3 points in the protective seat|pg||
nt|paulg:  "transfer the king" rule|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  as partner cannot easily overcall 1@s|pg||
nt|mamos:  ive certainly played with partner's who expected me to protect there|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  adding 3 to 10, gives 13, which would not be enough for a 1NT overcall in second seat|pg||
nt|paulg:  West has no source of tricks, so even if partner has a good fourteen count opposite he does not wish to be in game ... the main reason to pass I think|pg||
nt|phil352:  if you adhere to that it's important for partner to subtract 3 though!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the scores to date are at http://www.seniorcamrose.ayrshirebridge.co.uk/index.php/round-robin-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: apology an early glitch has lost the play on this one!|pg||
nt|paulg:  the normal junior method is for both partners to add 3, but these players probably cannot remember their junior days|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  players in this event have to be 60+|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzea: +2 |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or at least be 60 during the current year|pg||
nt|paulg:  Iain Sime from Scotland probably the youngest in the event, he has only just qualified|pg||

nt|mamos:  this is a wea k major suit .|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@h probably shows a minimum hand with hearts|pg||
nt|mamos:  5+ card suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  although with the Irish it is often difficult to judge what they think is minimum or maximum|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: well judged    but if going to pass 3@H  west might as well have bid 2@H to start|pg||
