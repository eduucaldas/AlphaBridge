nt|murat e: first two boards offering two slams|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: nice @H slam|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  slam zone again this time 6 @c/6@h|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  very fitting hands |pg||
nt|djneill:  showing a singleton/void is one of the best slam tools, and is part of the relay toolkit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|djneill:  I think we may see 6@c if this is relaying North's shape (2@s looks artificial :p)|pg||
nt|murat e: yes singleton opposite three small is an excellent holding|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  6 @c is best -it has some play even if @h are 4-1|pg||
mb|4N|nt|djneill:  yes!|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|bobholl: 6@h may make if @C 41 :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  how can you get rid of @c loser if you have 1|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C 41 with 4 in west|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  so, E-W might know from relays North's shape, but knowsNOTHING about South|pg||
nt|djneill:  very difficult to defend|pg||
nt|murat e: clubs 4-1 you go down in 6 clubs after spade lead even if jack fourth with west|pg||
pc|sA|nt|djneill:  normally against3-suiter you lead trump, but West is a little afraid of finessing partner|pg||

nt|hedyg: 3@H showed force in @H towards 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: of course @c never entered the picture and EW did not find their fit|pg||
