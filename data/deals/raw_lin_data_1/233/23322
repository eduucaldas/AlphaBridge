mb|p|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: 3@H was perhaps questionable with secondary minor values only|pg||
nt|bobholl: probably hoped on a NV save|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@h not a strong bid certainly, making 4@h questionable to me|pg||
nt|geot: Hi:) So this will be the "final" of the group, Norway 10 VPs ahead of Germany. |pg||
nt|geot: Norway can afford to lose 19-11 and still be in the final|pg||

pc|d6|nt|grebrof: 3nt often go home here|pg||
nt|psyck: yes & with this trump break, 3N is even preferable to 3@d|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: well, I cant see that 3@d was invitational anyway, but ok|pg||
nt|psyck: one only opens with lighter hcp when there are compensating factors, so you still treat it as a normal opening|pg||
nt|geot: There might be a spade guess if West is ducking spade to the king, so.....well I think it is just a partscore to be honest|pg||
pc|d7|nt|baldfriede: it seems we had a little transmission delay here|pg||
nt|geot: the @CA must be onside as well, and trumps not 4-1|pg||

pc|dA|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is a good contract... odds on with normal breaks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|grebrof: I agree - 4@s|pg||
nt|clinch: Quick claim coming|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|baldfriede: this may be costly|pg||

pc|c7|nt|stc: After pass in S, 1@d, N will bid a number of @Hs|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like NS can make 4@h, getting there would not be easy however|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14  covers many unexpected [for mortals] shapes|pg||
nt|murat e: good start for romania|pg||
nt|baldfriede: only part-score hands so far. no game here either|pg||
nt|baldfriede: very low NT here|pg||

nt|geot: this should....|pg||
mb|2N|mb|d|mb|3C|nt|clinch: no, true enough :)|pg||

nt|psyck: esp at fav vul :)|pg||
nt|stc: and the 3rd board with @hs in NS :)|pg||

nt|stc: 6IMP for Monaco on bo 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H max of 16 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: EW  opening 2 bids show 10-13 HCP and unbal hand -- but not allowed with both majors    and opening 1@H/@S needs better hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: a disadvantage from NF system not able to open west hand|pg||

nt|geot: Hi Murat|pg||
nt|geot: East has a good hand, but if he does anything but bidding 4@S it will be 4@D|pg||
nt|geot: and then denying a club cuebid, so they should rest in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: hi geo|pg||

nt|geot: I understand East is slam interested, but 4NT seems a little hasty (?)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: this does not really help declarer. cue bids would be better in this situation|pg||
mb|6S|nt|grebrof: the Polacks are leading anyway, due to the swing at board one where the Mongasks found 3nt|pg||
nt|snorre: 3NT maybe better than 4@h?|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup:  2 @h is well stopped 2nt already in danger|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe they dont like to cuebid shortage in partners first suit, but then 4@H is an ok bid too|pg||
nt|geot: Only a heart lead will give declarer the contract as the diamonds are not 3-2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sunsamvar: Classic hand for safety play in @Ss.. cash @Sa first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 3 probably|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Frey took very conservative approach with 2@H rebid|pg||

mb|1D|nt|geot: Well done to make 1@S on the 5-0, but dangerous board as 4@H should make|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N=18+ HCP, 5+5+ or 6+4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: obviously they count HCP differently than we do :)|pg||

nt|andersk: I dont know, Snorre, Im thinking loud, IF THEY play Gazil|pg||
nt|snorre: Gazilli is a convention after 1M - 1NT as far as I know|pg||
nt|andersk: 2@C is a normal bid from Berg, but IF that is conventional 15+ hand, he have to bid 3 @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kidding about HCP counting -- the south hand is much stronger than 4321 count suggests|pg||
nt|baldfriede: he may settle for 3nt though with a rather flat shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N was a relay -- but didn't promise points  [no kidding]|pg||
nt|stc: but also didn't deny|pg||
nt|bobholl: they always are distributional when opening 2@H or@S so ??|pg||
nt|baldfriede: lost connection for a moment|pg||
nt|murat e: 8 tricks only if no surprises|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: no, 4@h it is|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|geot: I do not know for sure the agreements here, but would have thought N could bid 2H over 1D to show 12-14 and four hearts, and 1H normally = 3, so now is showing some extras|pg||
nt|geot: 25HCPs, 4-4, but difficult when trumps are so badly placed|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I see no way of making it|pg||
nt|baldfriede: especially since oppenents have 8910 in @h too|pg||
nt|geot: On the 2@H partscore (board 26) Germany found a tough 3NT and won it (club lead needed to set it)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andersk: Thats true, however many play 1 @D as 4+ @D and therefore play 2 @C as Gazilli over 1 @D openings too|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west didn't double 3 @c so not so easy to lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: it is like the dutch muiderberg only stronger |pg||

pc|cJ|nt|torosyukse:  ya da maca heyecan gelsin istiyor:)|pg||
nt|murat e: less than 8  maybe.....|pg||
nt|geot: Yes, even though the diamonds are producing six tricks it is only eight from top|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|geot: the club lead was ok, and would have been super if the diamonds were not running...|pg||
nt|geot: West must not cash club tricks, will set up the 9th for declarer, but should know by his partners signal (?)|pg||
nt|geot: so they are up 11, but remember the slam on bd 28|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: defense slipped in other room on deal 2, if the @cQ was not covered, 4@s would have gone down|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|geot: If he takes the @CJ he has to find the spade switch|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: but unlike Muiderberg  fantunes 2@H/@S opener's do NOT guarantee 2nd suit|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @s switch now|pg||
nt|geot: Odin (Svendsen) will go down here, and it is a good chance he will go two down|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|snorre: B14: well bid by Charlsen - Hoftasiska in Open. 6@c is a very nice contract...|pg||
nt|snorre: 6@c +13 IMP in other matces I think...   |pg||

pc|dQ|nt|po-s: that spade 7...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|snorre: If east wanted to play for clubs 3-3, he should have tried that earlier, when he still had spades left...|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Ahora se cargan los resultados nuevamente.|pg||
nt|stc: not for Encho :(|pg||
nt|geot: This can end in 7@H which is a v good contract|pg||

mb|3H|nt|bobholl: is this real or are they joking again|pg||

nt|baldfriede: it has to be played carefully though|pg||
nt|geot: Even 7NT has chances on a double squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 12 top tricks, North must keep diamonds, South must keep spades. Who can keep clubs?|pg||
nt|geot: A club lead might disturb it though.....|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer can ruff 2@s before leading trumps to set up the 13th trick|pg||

nt|bobholl: they are lucky it is NV|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, only 5 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  4@c over the double showed a game acceptance|pg||
nt|psyck: it is common to use 2@d instead of 2@c in modified Ghestem variations|pg||
nt|geot: A light overcall would have propelled them to a tough but playable game, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: running scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC-2012/12_05_16_team.html|pg||

nt|baldfriede: so the grand has been found. now it has to be made|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: E treating it as strong Micheals i suppose|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|snorre: Hoffa wins 10 tricks there...   I bet a dollar :)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|henryb:  didn't both declarers start with 10 top tricks?|pg||
