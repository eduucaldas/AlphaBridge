nt|murat e: hi good morning everybody|pg||
nt|baldfriede: an interesting board to start with. E/W may well go too high here|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Esperemos ver bridge y un juego limpio por parte de ambos equipos.|pg||
nt|grebrof: http://german-bridge-trophy.de/|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@H was perhaps questionable with secondary minor values only|pg||
nt|bobholl: probably hoped on a NV save|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@h not a strong bid certainly, making 4@h questionable to me|pg||
nt|geot: Hi:) So this will be the "final" of the group, Norway 10 VPs ahead of Germany. |pg||
nt|geot: Norway can afford to lose 19-11 and still be in the final|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|grebrof: 3nt often go home here|pg||
nt|psyck: yes & with this trump break, 3N is even preferable to 3@d|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|grebrof: if N plays trumps now, you can only ruff one @c in the short hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: well, I cant see that 3@d was invitational anyway, but ok|pg||
nt|psyck: one only opens with lighter hcp when there are compensating factors, so you still treat it as a normal opening|pg||
nt|geot: There might be a spade guess if West is ducking spade to the king, so.....well I think it is just a partscore to be honest|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: it seems we had a little transmission delay here|pg||
nt|geot: the @CA must be onside as well, and trumps not 4-1|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: Open Room began with  3   that's strange|pg||
pc|h8|nt|grebrof: with 10hp, I tend to have 5-5/6-4 or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is a good contract... odds on with normal breaks|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree - 4@s|pg||
nt|clinch: Quick claim coming|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|baldfriede: this may be costly|pg||

pc|s4|nt|stc: After pass in S, 1@d, N will bid a number of @Hs|pg||

nt|snorre: Welcome to the last 24 board in Bonn Nations Cup..  Norway Open vs. Poland|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like NS can make 4@h, getting there would not be easy however|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14  covers many unexpected [for mortals] shapes|pg||
nt|murat e: good start for romania|pg||
nt|baldfriede: only part-score hands so far. no game here either|pg||
nt|baldfriede: very low NT here|pg||
nt|geot: his should be a standard 4@S E/W, but the mini NT may make problems for E/W?|pg||
nt|geot: this should....|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|snorre: 1NT 9-15hp 3seat green|pg||

nt|jbgood: hand for a minisplinter - not sure they play that|pg||
mb|3C|nt|clinch: no, true enough :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N is the default bid for hands that can't open 1-suit or 2-suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ew has clearcut 140  -so how many down here perhaps -3 best def|pg||
nt|snorre: 2@d show both red|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sunsamvar: may not reach game..|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont understand people that dont bid a 6 card major|pg||
nt|psyck: esp at fav vul :)|pg||
nt|stc: and the 3rd board with @hs in NS :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: which makes last board really costly|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5 point span for an NT bid? rather unusual; even 4 is rare|pg||
nt|snorre: Nilsand defence when the weak NT is doubled|pg||
nt|jbgood: N has underbid first time - but perhaps not sure whether his clubs are good enough for game|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and if N leads a @d game does not even make|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|grebrof: even at superVUL (if there is such a thing)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good 3@D bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: I would bid 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: if Open Room type "Pass" for all boards not played, this works|pg||

nt|geot: undo|pg||

mb|p|nt|stc: yes, last train|pg||

nt|clinch: So 2@h Non-forcing eh|pg||
nt|baldjean: Apparently|pg||
nt|clinch: Guess they have to double on a lot of hands?|pg||
nt|bobholl: in holland it was popular some 20 years ago but not anymore|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||

pc|c3|nt|grebrof: here everything is chill, so it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: this needs a @d ruff & fav trumps...|pg||

nt|geot: Hi:)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: Running scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC-2012/12_05_16_team.html|pg||
nt|geot: I think Germany have to win by 29 IMPs to win 23-7 which will be enough to win the group|pg||
mb|p|nt|torosyukse:  suleymanin 3karosu kendi 4piklerine baraj olmustu ama, murat kucuk kor cikinca, 3nt de yaptilar|pg||
nt|stc: 6IMP for Monaco on bo 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H max of 16 hcp|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: EW  opening 2 bids show 10-13 HCP and unbal hand -- but not allowed with both majors    and opening 1@H/@S needs better hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: a disadvantage from NF system not able to open west hand|pg||
nt|clinch: 1NT=11-14|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: 1NT: 11-14|pg||
nt|murat e: 4 hearts present no problem here only danger is going too high maybe|pg||
nt|snorre: 3NT -4 last board. A normal contract, normal lead and normal score...   :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 4 down is just normal bridge:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: Roland's favourite - 20 - 20 on the two sides|pg||
nt|jbgood: do they have a tool to find the spde fit?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|snorre: aha!!   rewelcome...   :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: West will be surprised by this transfer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-14  1st/2nd seat  not-vul   otherwise 15-17|pg||
nt|geot: Hi Murat|pg||
nt|geot: East has a good hand, but if he does anything but bidding 4@S it will be 4@D|pg||
nt|geot: and then denying a club cuebid, so they should rest in 4@S|pg||
nt|jbgood: some play 2@c as stayman now - they too apparently|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: hi geo|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: oh well:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: since 1 @c my be 2... (but wrong again)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzee: kapalý odanýnýn bilgisayýrnda küçük bir sorun oldu en kýsa zamanda geri gelecekler|pg||
nt|geot: I understand East is slam interested, but 4NT seems a little hasty (?)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: this does not really help declarer. cue bids would be better in this situation|pg||
pc|dT|nt|grebrof: the Polacks are leading anyway, due to the swing at board one where the Mongasks found 3nt|pg||
nt|snorre: 3NT maybe better than 4@h?|pg||
nt|stc: not the time to push|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H on or pass|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: in north i mean|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, EW are very timid, maybe waiting in bushes|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|grebrof: where they didnt find :)|pg||
nt|stc: even 3@h is too high|pg||
pc|sT|nt|runnerup:  2 @h is well stopped 2nt already in danger|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe they dont like to cuebid shortage in partners first suit, but then 4@H is an ok bid too|pg||
nt|geot: Only a heart lead will give declarer the contract as the diamonds are not 3-2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sunsamvar: Classic hand for safety play in @Ss.. cash @Sa first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 3 probably|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and 3nt -2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Frey took very conservative approach with 2@H rebid|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -1 looks normal|pg||
nt|baldfriede: not true, in my opinion. only @c lead sets it. 1@d can be ruffed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|snorre: 3+1+3+2= 9 by starting with clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: Sorry for the problems with the first 3 boards, now everything is fine....|pg||
nt|baldjean: They kinow the doctors are anything but timid ansd wait for their chance to jump them from the bushes like tigers.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room, will Rehder open west hand 1@S?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|tez: iyi akþamlar|pg||
nt|stc: .|pg||
nt|geot: Sorry, to quick there....of course heart ace will give a club discard|pg||
pc|s8|nt|murat e: this was unexpected south was afraid if north rebids spades so lost the game here|pg||
nt|geot: when West is void:=|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stc: Monaco in 5@HX on the @c slam hand|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Burn's law doubly violated|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: better diamond return i think, but might not matter|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: hoþgeldin tez hoca|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzdu: Buen remate de parte de villegas pidiendo la salida a @d ùnica para multar en este caso.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  FN -they dont miss defence here|pg||
nt|snorre: Svendsen doesn't lead his stiff club Ace because he has DJxx spades. Not going for ruffs with length in spades., attacking best suit is normally correct defence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: only 4 more tricks for E/W, since no communication|pg||
pc|c3|nt|grebrof: 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|geot: But Berg made it simple|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jbgood: not a big deal since 1 NT surely makes - just a question of how many down this inelegant contract goes|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|grebrof: if E ruffs a @c can play for length in @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: fantoni can't guess wheather nunes has 4 or 5@H|pg||
nt|snorre: @D before hearts best...|pg||
nt|jbgood: declarer has to play ace or else he will get tapped|pg||
nt|snorre: but doensnt matter I think|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|grebrof: that was if E lead the @c 9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzdu: Mala suerte para el team Fornasari.|pg||
nt|grebrof: should keep @h ace|pg||
nt|psyck: will lose a @s, @d, & @c now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @D fin now|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s to K and a @s is better in my mind - maybe W throws some minorcard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i thk @D fin and low @S better for control|pg||
nt|geot: Poland is leading their group with this and another match to go, and the winners of the two groups will play the final later today|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baldfriede: yes; may even set up a @d that way|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: other table now playing  39   you can spy on them without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|hT|nt|snorre: a more intersting board if playing MP's. Berg just go for his 9 tricks....|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|bobholl: wow |pg||
pc|h9|nt|snorre: safe to try 10...|pg||

pc|h5|nt|snorre: West has a spade more than north..   Important|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  39  where Wladow was able to make a negative Free Bid to play 2@H    Frey used a transfer over the 1@S overcall and raised to 3@H but that ended the auction|pg||
nt|bobholl: he can spare @S t but does he realize|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup:  hmm wrong guess -sorry they missed this defence|pg||

nt|baldjean: only 1 v though*|pg||
nt|baldjean: sorry, was not meant for the tablee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winning @DK so early seems key flaw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but easy as defender to fear endplay|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if they missed it -it was difficult -i agree|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would have expected some kind of strong opening from N with that hand, not 1@s|pg||
nt|geot: one down and Norway is closer to the final than ever|pg||
nt|jbgood: this time it is fair to say that the 14 Polish imps were well deserved|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|stc: nice @s split !!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=10-13 hcp, 5+@S unbal  [but not 4+@H]|pg||
mb|1D|nt|geot: Well done to make 1@S on the 5-0, but dangerous board as 4@H should make|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT was a bad contract (as   2 was)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: unbal means 6+ suit or some 2-suiter   [5422 treated as bal]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing|pg||
nt|snorre: I am not sure that 3NT over 2@d other room was Charlsen's only possible bid..|pg||
mb|2C|nt|geot: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC-2012/12_05_16_team.html for running scores|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=0-9|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stc: EW already in trouble|pg||
nt|geot: RD = 3 hearts|pg||
nt|murat e: a light double here opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: 2@d shows 5+@h|pg||
nt|snorre: maybe double over 1@d is better to with 4-4 majors and a passed pd..|pg||

mb|3S|nt|torosyukse:  mehmet sanirim rakip de misfit diye pas gecti|pg||
nt|andersk: 3@C looks like a normal spot|pg||
nt|snorre: 2@c for me|pg||
nt|snorre: North show @h only....|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe they play Gazill over 1 @D?|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnarable it is tricky :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=18+ HCP, 5+5+ or 6+4|pg||
nt|geot: 1D = transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: 3@c forcing? think so|pg||
nt|stc: but in fact no double no trouble|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be S should double in 2nd round|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  40   Rehder did open 1@S    then   1@S-4@D//4@S-end   NS never in the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obviously they count HCP differently than we do :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  needs @c lead and 2. -then @s to beat 4 @s|pg||
nt|snorre: makes bidding more flexible|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andersk: 2@C on any 15+ hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC-2012/12_05_16_team.html for running scores|pg||
nt|baldjean: N should let it stand then.|pg||
nt|stc: 2SA was probably a 2 way bid, so S had to wait|pg||
nt|snorre: as you can see here. End up in a good partscore|pg||
mb|5H|nt|andersk: 3 @C max 14 and 5-5|pg||
nt|baldfriede: it is quitee useful to transfer after a double over partner's opening. if the strong hand has to lead ir often gains a trick|pg||
mb|d|nt|snorre: ?? 3@c is 5-5 and gameforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC-2012/12_05_16_team.html for running scores|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont know, Snorre, Im thinking loud, IF THEY play Gazil|pg||
nt|snorre: Gazilli is a convention after 1M - 1NT as far as I know|pg||
nt|andersk: 2@C is a normal bid from Berg, but IF that is conventional 15+ hand, he have to bid 3 @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kidding about HCP counting -- the south hand is much stronger than 4321 count suggests|pg||
nt|baldfriede: he may settle for 3nt though with a rather flat shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N was a relay -- but didn't promise points  [no kidding]|pg||
nt|stc: but also didn't deny|pg||
nt|bobholl: they always are distributional when opening 2@H or@S so ??|pg||
nt|baldfriede: lost connection for a moment|pg||
nt|murat e: 8 tricks only if no surprises|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: no, 4@h it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: I do not know for sure the agreements here, but would have thought N could bid 2H over 1D to show 12-14 and four hearts, and 1H normally = 3, so now is showing some extras|pg||
nt|geot: 25HCPs, 4-4, but difficult when trumps are so badly placed|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I see no way of making it|pg||
nt|baldfriede: especially since oppenents have 8910 in @h too|pg||
nt|geot: On the 2@H partscore (board 26) Germany found a tough 3NT and won it (club lead needed to set it)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andersk: Thats true, however many play 1 @D as 4+ @D and therefore play 2 @C as Gazilli over 1 @D openings too|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west didn't double 3 @c so not so easy to lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: it is like the dutch muiderberg only stronger |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|torosyukse:  ya da maca heyecan gelsin istiyor:)|pg||
nt|murat e: less than 8  maybe.....|pg||
nt|geot: Yes, even though the diamonds are producing six tricks it is only eight from top|pg||
pc|dK|nt|geot: the club lead was ok, and would have been super if the diamonds were not running...|pg||
nt|geot: West must not cash club tricks, will set up the 9th for declarer, but should know by his partners signal (?)|pg||
nt|geot: so they are up 11, but remember the slam on bd 28|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck: defense slipped in other room on deal 2, if the @cQ was not covered, 4@s would have gone down|pg||
nt|snorre: 4@h wins this time....|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h a good game|pg||
nt|jbgood: not a cheap "sacrifice"|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c2|nt|stc: looks like -2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|geot: If he takes the @CJ he has to find the spade switch|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: but unlike Muiderberg  fantunes 2@H/@S opener's do NOT guarantee 2nd suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|baldfriede: @s switch now|pg||
nt|geot: Odin (Svendsen) will go down here, and it is a good chance he will go two down|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|snorre: east can bid more than 2@h with support and/or a better hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|snorre: B14: well bid by Charlsen - Hoftasiska in Open. 6@c is a very nice contract...|pg||
nt|snorre: 6@c +13 IMP in other matces I think...   |pg||
nt|snorre: 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|andersk: I do not agree with Jan Tore berg's line here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|po-s: that spade 7...|pg||

mb|2S|nt|grebrof: thats true|pg||

nt|baldfriede: they apparently don't use Bergen raises|pg||
nt|geot: Hard to stop lower, but it looks like one down to me|pg||

nt|po-s: predictions please! Make or no make|pg||
nt|baldjean: make|pg||
nt|stc: make|pg||
nt|bobholl: Make 90%|pg||
nt|geot: Tough bidding by North, but to be fair, if S has not so much in clubs it could easily be a slam|pg||
nt|snorre: pass an option i MP's, but not in IMPS|pg||
pc|sK|nt|geot: The diamond lead was maybe natural, but the spade K would have been the winner, most likely for 2 down|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: anyone for 2@H instead of dbl with the west hand?|pg||
nt|baldjean: Elinscu will switch to a red suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  now west had better @c =double KJ974 -last hand where he had KJ732 -he missed the double now he didn't want to miss chance|pg||
pc|s6|nt|po-s: I don´t think so|pg||
nt|baldjean: Now however...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at trick 2  Allavena guessed @H correctly|pg||
nt|bobholl: down 80% |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @h9 at other table, but i don't see that affecting the guess from dummy|pg||
nt|murat e: if dia finesse was on as heart finesse already good.....|pg||

nt|baldfriede: now N/S have shot their powder|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@C X strongly suggests they'll end up in @H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|psyck: dbl for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Turbo   so 5@C probably an odd number of keycards|pg||
nt|snorre: will he win this one, friends?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes|pg||

pc|cK|nt|stc: DAX : German Stock Index|pg||
nt|runnerup:  turbo is played by some others also -but for minors -it saves you out of destany to ask for aces and find 2 off -and you are in 5 @h already -and minor is your suit|pg||
nt|geot: Correct is to play the Q of hearts|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h8|pc|c5|pg||

nt|geot: Even 7NT has chances on a double squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 12 top tricks, North must keep diamonds, South must keep spades. Who can keep clubs?|pg||
nt|geot: A club lead might disturb it though.....|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer can ruff 2@s before leading trumps to set up the 13th trick|pg||

pc|s7|nt|snorre: two|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@c over the double showed a game acceptance|pg||
nt|psyck: it is common to use 2@d instead of 2@c in modified Ghestem variations|pg||

mb|1S|nt|snorre: Transfers after @c-opening. Most players at toplevel in Norway play like this nowadays|pg||

mb|3D|nt|snorre: no, east gave him an IMP by throwing his club   :)|pg||

nt|snorre: BBO is brutal..   "How is it possible to go down i 3NT??!"  |pg||
nt|jbgood: operator may have missed something here|pg||
nt|snorre: operator....  This isnt correct|pg||
nt|jbgood: Odin didnt pass first time after prd opened?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC-2012/12_05_16_team.html for running scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Oja  1@D=(9)11-16 HCP, not 5+@H/@S|pg||
nt|jbgood: and I think also denying 4@s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 0+@D|pg||
nt|runnerup:  now there is a cahnce to stop under game|pg||
nt|runnerup:  chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically  Nunes would have to stretch with 1@S|pg||
nt|lokaty: it should bring them 2 imos:)|pg||
nt|po-s: A bit aggressive by Nunes - and the opposite by North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but about a Queen short of the 12/13 with both majors|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|snorre: 4@h 10 tricks is a good result for the danish...  Let us see if Norway can do the same...|pg||
nt|snorre: a normal Norwegian bidding.. :)|pg||
nt|geot: Is the meaning of 3@H clear here? showing stopper? Looks like, East is bidding the game that most likely will make|pg||
nt|geot: but Berg bids again!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: yes, 3@h is showing the stopper in @h|pg||
nt|geot: East will double (?)|pg||
nt|geot: He is probably considering 4NT |pg||
nt|geot: vul game......|pg||
nt|jbgood: or 5 @c?|pg||
nt|po-s: not really 5C?|pg||
nt|geot: because of the screens it may look like N is thinking. But he is not :) East is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: sorry :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: erkel löve çalmaya oynayacaktýr|pg||
pc|cA|nt|geot: If the defence ag 5@D can cash a spade, then three rounds of hearts, declarer will get an awkward choice|pg||
nt|geot: Wow|pg||

nt|vugraphzdd: Running scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC-2012/12_05_16_team.html|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5@c will go down because of the singleton Q@h with N|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hello grandson. I can't come. will ir be enough if I send my rolling pin?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|snorre: 1@d -> @h's    2@d -> GF|pg||
nt|jbgood: Charlsen in the west seat in OR had a spade overcall - and was raised for 2 down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|torosyukse:  rakibin zonuna iyi baraj oldu|pg||
nt|torosyukse:  heran yaptirilabilir de|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: biraz kritik bende ona bakýyordum :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west migth double 4 @s -so better stop|pg||
nt|jbgood: very cautious non-acceptance by Berg - I was sure he would have accepted...|pg||
nt|snorre: :)  My grandma was a great lady. She didnt play bridge, but my gradpa was the one that tought me bridge..  |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: i only said he might be considering 5 @c - not that i expected him to do so..|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|geot: good start, then one spade trick followed by Ace and another heart......if declarer misguesses it is 800|pg||
nt|jbgood: but perhaps he (Berg) was minimum in all repects, since he didnt open a feeble 1 NT|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: we know wladow can be hypercreative, but here looks a bit offtrack|pg||
pc|hT|nt|geot: nice defence|pg||
pc|h2|nt|snorre: 1NT Opening -> 8-12, so he normalle have 13+ for his NT rebid|pg||
nt|snorre: normally|pg||
pc|h3|nt|geot: That was it for Germany, I think, although they will get a chance in bd 36 as well. |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: S might still have 4 @s (as far as the operator heard)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: Roland -- my issue would be  the pure majors and only 5 losers|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|po-s: I guess many would open 1S|pg||
nt|po-s: five losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the key problem for Nunes   if he opens 1@s it is FORCING|pg||
nt|baldfriede: now to choose the right suit. by far not easy|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bobholl: they score very good on their 2 openings|pg||

pc|s6|nt|geot: 1!/3@D/4@D/X|pg||
nt|snorre: kibs coming from Open Roon still dont believe Svendsen going down i 3NT last board..  :)|pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|nt|snorre: looks like Norway win 2@s on B22. 4 IMP probably|pg||
nt|baldjean: teempting*|pg||
nt|baldjean: tempting*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will be less tempting for Elinescu in context of limited opening bid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: should wind up in 4@s|pg||
nt|geot: Yes. This hand is just about not trying a "silly" 3NT, and not getting any spectacular ideas about the play of the spades. Should be a push|pg||

pc|s8|nt|snorre: This will cost more than 300..    IMP's for Norway on what I called a boring one :)|pg||

pc|c3|nt|vugraphzdd: a misunderstanding in the bidding of Denkmark i guess|pg||
nt|snorre: Strange bidding by east..   West has shown some clubs. That is all or?|pg||
nt|bobholl: in the other room N openend 1 nt 2@D 2@H double and S gave a strange redouble now n bid 4@H|pg||

pc|h3|nt|geot: Declarer must not play North for 10xxx of trumps.....:)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|geot: The trump lead was in a way the only thing that could create something at all on this hand. But a trump lead from 10xxx ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: how long before next round pls Lukas|pg||
nt|snorre: Poland will lead this Finale after 12 boards, but the lead is only 5/6 IMP..  Another 12 boards to come soon|pg||

nt|jbgood: so the underlead was a bad idea as long as prd didnt return a diamond|pg||
nt|jbgood: ducking the heart was not beating I think - if declarer played normal bridge S would be endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: Thanks all for watching, hope to see you tomorrow, when we show the Vugraph from the German Bridge Trophy, also here from Bonn|pg||
