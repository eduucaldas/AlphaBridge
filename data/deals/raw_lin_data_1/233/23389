mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|kingcur: now moving to  15, and we have results from the CR already, which was the idea :)|pg||
nt|murat e: critical board this one slam may be bid|pg||
nt|adonis18:  6@c?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|kingcur: S opened 2@D (multi, I presume) in CR, after which EW landed in 3NT|pg||
nt|murat e: both minor suit slams depend on finding diamond lady|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6@C seems on @D finesse|pg||
nt|kingcur: as is 6@D|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|adonis18:  yesterday in a similar slam the @DQ was third too|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|murat e: uh|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kingcur: this slam is less than just the finesse, since @DQ could be onside and 4th|pg||
nt|adonis18:  declarer didn't finesse|pg||
nt|kingcur: which may make 6@C the better slam|pg||
nt|adonis18:  without opening b S no indication of short suits|pg||
nt|murat e: aker on lead dia lead can solve declarers problems|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kingcur: specs suggesting x@D lead, but that's a poor choice if you are looking at an A yourself.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|murat e: of course|pg||
nt|kingcur: so, I suspect these are Italian kibs looking to make Lauria's life easier :)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  leading a singleton trump against a slam may need some medicine to p|pg||
nt|athene: if Lauria could find out that south had @SAJ10xxx, he might judge that he has four hearts (no 2@S opener) so he would get diamonds right|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see how he can find out the spade position|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, S opening a weak bid here would have made declarer's task easier for sure|pg||

nt|fabsayc: missed opportunity for trailing team|pg||
nt|runnerup:  nice kvick tricks in 3nt and south has no problems to bid that|pg||
nt|athene: good low-hcp 3nt; 100% secure on any lead and any lie|pg||
nt|athene: yes it shows the power of a long suit with quick tricks outside|pg||
nt|athene: NS don't have a single point wasted in fact|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Duboin is wondering which major to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time 4 @s is anly 300 but you lose in a long run if you bid those -because in all cases ns aren't aware what they do and 3nt can go down|pg||
nt|athene: yes i don't think EW can reasonably contemplate a sacrifice|pg||
nt|athene: -300 vs -400 is the best you can possibly hope for|pg||
nt|athene: and it might often be -300 or -500 against +50|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|sharkey: yes - but 3@H looks like a make so down 1 may be good business|pg||

nt|sharkey: Some may not bid 3@S with only 3 trumps so this could be IMPs to the Patane team|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sharkey: Some number of @D here...|pg||
nt|athene: west neither strong nor unbalanced enough for 2@C opener in first or second, but here the requirements are relaxed|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: some prefer to keep the 2-suited overcalls weak or very strong, so a 12 count might not qualify|pg||

nt|runnerup:  vulnerability is bad so north has about cards to expect by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|gsper:  So 4@S is a good save, but unlikely to be found now|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: no chance here of course|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you just play spades and accept two down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double is more flexible, as they say|pg||

nt|athene: tricky declarer play problem here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to decide whether to try to use the spades, or go for two diamond ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is easy when you see all the cards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a double for takeout by north if available would have worked well|pg||
nt|queequeg: welcome Bob :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: N obviously knows what to expect from 2@h |pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|gsper:  N might have doubled 2@D, but with both opponents showing cards, and vul, it was not very attractive|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H finesse and can make. 6@H+1@S+2@D+1@C=10|pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: even with this nice start, and trumps 3-3, declarer should be one down|pg||
nt|athene: east just holds up in spades and there is nowhere to put the @D109|pg||

nt|athene: sometimes that sort of thing is useful but here even if it worked, it would not help especially|pg||
nt|athene: even if clubs break you get 2 hearts, 4 clubs, spade...that's not 3NT by a fair way|pg||

nt|athene: in the bidding, a hidden issue is whether north's "double-then-3@H" route showed just any hand too strong for 2@H first time, or whether it does promise a flexible hand|pg||

nt|danilo1: so ... @D 3-3 is not the chance|pg||

nt|baardolav: Hello all|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gsper:  Andy, the ambiguous nature of 2@D complicated it for N|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but all that is a bit tenuous|pg||

nt|mdgraham: two off with the spade misguess - but it was never making|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: defence went plus, but it might have gone better|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D=majors|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  should make on the lay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|gsper:  1NT 12-14, often offshape|pg||
nt|athene: when south bids 3@H with only six he has to have some shape i think|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe declarer should have played for 4-1 spades, but not easy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do i collect the 1085 cokes|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2x120 good start for both|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: maybe can block the diamonds and survive|pg||
mb|d|nt|gsper:  Transfer, of course. E was doing the thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i prefer 2@C for that purpose, as partner can bid 2@D with no preference|pg||
nt|athene: interesting, he doesn't go 4@H|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt ew here and if something /else ) happens -it is a suprice|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: the problem with opening 4@H is that if opps bid 4@S or 5@C over it, as they very likely will, you are left not knowing what to do|pg||

mb|5H|nt|athene: however, the way it has gone, he has hardly shown his hand either|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: this auction would show extras for me, and for sure that double was penalty|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 2@H transfer to @S and 2@S for @S check. Am I right?|pg||

nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello CK and wlc.|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think just bidding 4 right away with north is reasonable|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not see how South can know what is useful and what is not.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: might have a club slam opposite suitable cards, but it's shooting for the moon a bit - 3NT is practical |pg||

nt|tez: @h dönüþü dýþýndakiler kayýp|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: on a club attack declarer might have to overtake in spades to get a fast pitch from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know what the redouble was|pg||
nt|athene: and i can't believe angelini did either|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: maybe if the auction had tempoed out differently he would have bid - for example if west made some raise and then east bid 4@S and that was passed round to him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if the @s10 forces the king the defence would need an immediate diamond switch|pg||
nt|athene: so losing one heart, one diamond, and one club|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks like -1|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps being NV was a factor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let's hope we are guessing well|pg||
nt|athene: on any other lead he can happily unblock the @SK as he has time to build an entry to his @SAQ, so plus one|pg||

nt|fabsayc: maybe but could be some fantoni magic|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another problem on defense for west, succeeds if he clears the spades, but also must unguard the diamonds later|pg||
nt|athene: but as it went, bidding 5@D in front of his partner is a bit of a gamble|pg||
nt|athene: of course, passing is a big gamble too|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: @Ss must do it|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3nt should be down even after a spade lead?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: lanzarotti obviously takes 2@S as showing a very weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: the immediate bid after the redouble|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems like a heart would have been killing|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H lead for 2 down, but now it has a chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it can make|pg||
nt|kemperg: will get the @Ds|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: I guess N could double 3@d with a good(ish) hand |pg||
nt|athene: you might say "well, obviously north must be broke, after the opponents have both shown decent hands"|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be a bit worried here; only 8 obvious tricks even with the club finesse working|pg||
nt|psyck: I like dbl of the options|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C just makes but 3@S could be for -500|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cc does not cover this auction, anybody know what 3@C is?|pg||
nt|queequeg: Open Room http://td.bboitalia.it/30.jpg|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will Sementa lead a low heart or the J :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: not sure about this - 2@c may be Gazzilli |pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS are too balanced, but it's hard for either side to realise this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzers (some of them) say 3@C asks for 4 card major or 5 card minor, 3d denies|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not many pairs include 5-card majors in the weak NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since i got at least 4 versions i am more confused than before :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe the have no choice with less than 14 pts|pg||
nt|baardolav: A endplay in @d / @h probably?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bobholl: @c queen is a nice card but not shown|pg||
nt|athene: well, no 4@C, so madala knows they are off the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: they'll play six, though, i would think|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2NT said he liked clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr: 5@D might make|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have a great hand for clubs in that context|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: oh well :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@h not very good needs @C 32 and king rigth most times|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, if you work out what partner has by trusting your opponents, then you get talked out of games when west has psyched the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: beautiful venue indeed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: but the spades are blocked so he can play on diamonds successfully|pg||
nt|athene: i think if 5@C was there, west would have bid it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did E se 4@C as foricng?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: need to be cautious    even 5 level could be too high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody ever won at bridge by trusting the opponents|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't think Sementa would compete to 3 level with a 4333 hand, but it works fine here|pg||
nt|baardolav: he can raise the diamonds yes... because versace do now have any spades left|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: so having agreements with partner is a better way to go, what with him being on your side|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most of the time.....|pg||
nt|athene: south can see declarer is all set to throw hearts on spades, so might as well attack hearts now?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C obviously something showing a good hand, maybe showing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on;y blocked if he wins this :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing king looks the odds play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: lead was @S9 showing bad suit|pg||
nt|athene: and if it was lauria who had the spades, he would have let versace win the first diamond to clear the suit surely|pg||

nt|mdgraham: there is no joy  in Mudville....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: in fact will have to play carefully       may go down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wonder if the @S4 had any significance|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he decided the only way to beat was partner having the @CA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for non baseball fans, that refers to a famous poem|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and a wasted @SQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|athene: if trumps are clubs are 3-2, you don't need the @CK right, do you? just lose club, ruff clubs good|pg||
nt|athene: *if trumps AND clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|athene: because you can cash clubs and get the heart through as well|pg||
nt|athene: partner having the @HK is not in itself enough; even if you cash some hearts, declarer can throw enough clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H would be interesting|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now 11 if not club return|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||

nt|gsper:  And likely a @C loser too|pg||

nt|ady: has to look after 4th diamond|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's true but still not much better than 50%|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but there are other chances too|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psyck: yes, easier call if 1@h was 5, i play it as 4+|pg||

nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to ruff a club and pick up trumps, losing just one spade, two diamonds and the @CA|pg||
nt|psyck: to prevent losing 2 trump tricks via @c ruff on a bad day...|pg||
nt|athene: well 3@S can be beaten with diamond ruff and then club shift i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't draw trumps and then get back to dummy fast to throw his club losers on the two good diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: neither do I but else why E bids 5@C:)|pg||
nt|tez: biraz az ama mantýklý 3 nt idi|pg||
nt|kingcur: To break the silence somewhat here, I have volunteered to comment|pg||
nt|kingcur: ah, hello Germ|pg||
mb|2D|an|weak in a major|mb|2N|nt|ady: 4@S  making n/s   but an excellent save for e/w in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know the intricacies of the NS methods but i suspect 2nt showed extras|pg||
nt|athene: but if west led a spade, east could win the @CA and return a diamond and then throw two clubs on spades|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer could never get to dummy as east could overruff with the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, all irrelevant anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or just a club lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 @c ok -here -4 @h makes ..so |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, essentially 3@C was modified puppet stayman|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Cor|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: think 3@S max|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some 9 in @h ew if opened and will |pg||
nt|athene: 5@D might come home but 4@C tick would have been a reasonable place to stop i think|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ady: not sure e/w will be able to enter the auction|pg||
nt|athene: if north bid only 2@S and east doubled, that would find the club fit, but that is surely the only way|pg||
nt|athene: and i think north will bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  4 losers in spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: But NS likely will end up in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: the only way 4@S makes is if the defence don't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to bid it - S will decline any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not happening|pg||
nt|athene: i think north just bids 3@S here and they play there|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree William|pg||
nt|ady: will east enter if north raises to 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@C also possibility - Splinter|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably double 2@S with the east cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@C NOT precision style, though it looks that way|pg||
nt|psyck: Right Bill, which is why I guess Markku said better chances played by N|pg||
nt|athene: double fit might come to light here|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h @h ve minör|pg||
nt|tez: dbl ceza deðil ve puan var|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: now a support double for spades i guess, so they find their 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sing @s makes it ofcause dangerous to open 4. hand|pg||
nt|athene: well sort of double fit :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  mainly that and west will lead @h Q --normally -@c lead only after peeping|pg||
nt|athene: many would just raise clubs with east, but sementa obviously feels that with opps bidding hearts, it is worth a lot for your side to find spades, rather than clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: south will have trouble showing hand now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: N has a shortage of points but great playing strength when pd bid @S|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt was a spade raise you would think south would bid a discouraging 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will pay to stop low here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like a direct 3@D invite, although the bid has several flaws|pg||
nt|psyck: 2C = 10-13 value, 5C-4other unbalanced, or 6+C|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D relay asking for 3-card major|pg||
nt|psyck: N's hand becomes powerful with Aces in pd's suit now|pg||
nt|athene: angelini can't bid less than game now, can he? ace in both partner's suits for a single raise|pg||
nt|athene: transfer responses, so 1@S shows diamonds|pg||
nt|kingcur: a weird deal, that previous one. points 20-20 but with extremely favourable lie of the cards for NS|pg||
pc|s4|nt|runnerup:  3. hands pass -was a view =suprice also|pg||
nt|kemperg: good 5@D rescue, red against green:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gsper:  2NT relay again|pg||
nt|athene: ok, apparently he can|pg||
nt|athene: east might balance now with a double|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last makeble bid NS 2@D|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: i think support doubles are not as popular in italy as in america, but still if you double 1@H with 4+ spades here you surely need them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could have responded 2@d, perhaps, but that may be FG, and S isn't quite strong enough for that (non strong-club opener)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry but don't have a CC for NS|pg||
nt|kingcur: so 4@H would have been two off, and 5@C was on ice|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec saw down possibility|pg||
nt|kingcur: except for 3 rounds of hearts, uppercutting West's trump J|pg||
nt|psyck: 3rd @h?|pg||
nt|kemperg: welcome Krishna|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: still will easy enough for defence to collect their 4 winners  |pg||
nt|athene: ok, the fifth spade is nice, and QJ doubleton is much better when partner opens the suit, but even so...|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i'm told 2NT is 6-4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tactical 3 @h to play in 4 ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and EW just make 2@S imo|pg||
nt|kingcur: hi Krishna :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: ah a spec suggests north is "she" - i was assuming a different angelini haha|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 now -but ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: everyone has shown his hand fairly, except N who should have bid stronger|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand why west bids spades rather than hearts, but it sure worked out|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: so 3@H was just attempting to sign off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT is FG|pg||
nt|athene: even if 2@D response were not GF you might bid a spade anyway so as not to lose the suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2000 |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h showed 3-4 @h|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d showed 1345|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought the redouble might give EW a better chance to find the right major, if west could pass and let east bid spades|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|runnerup:  200 -500 with x|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so north was weaker than i would have been |pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: very complicated hand, but at least the lead reveals south has no natural lead|pg||

nt|athene: getting to a nice safe 3@D partscore is not trivial really|pg||
nt|athene: also i have no idea what the redouble is all about :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: some specs would|pg||
nt|baardolav: maybe 4@d from north... south could bid 5@d for making, and find a good save for one down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: made now no problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless your playing flattery|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: but then north feels that facing any sort of heart fit it is worth a shot at game|pg||
nt|athene: run all the diamonds looks reasonable|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so if you pass 3. hand -why bid again ..ofcause souths 2 @s was aggressive also|pg||
nt|psyck: they have some defense, may not be all that clear to bid 5@c, though it is very likely they will bid it as insurance at this vul|pg||
nt|jaapfr: XX and 3@C and 3@D do mean: pls opps go to an unmakebele level:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now semanta must guess spade finesse or more diamonds|pg||
nt|danilo1: next "easy" 3NT ... but with @H wide opened ... after testing @C 3-3 (ending in dummy) ... Sementa may see better chance in @S finess than the risk to loose 3 @D tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he will get it right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup:   at least you get + score there -2 aces -and|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what north was worried about - pushing opps into 5@C making - but that is not a big danger when you have two aces and partner opened|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: it looks as though west bid 2@S because he assumed opps would compete further and then he could show hearts|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup:  norths|pg||
nt|athene: but why is he so anxious to bid 3 over 3?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as you said earlier about 2@S bid|pg||
nt|athene: partner doubled 2@D so you push them up to 3@D and beat them|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W thinks mb @H my pds suit|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kemperg: I think S would have dbl then|pg||

nt|athene: wake up, fantoni!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, misread the CC. 1NT can include a 4441 shape.|pg||
nt|athene: EW's 1nt has to cover a lot of hands unsuitable for other bids, sort of like a precision 1@D|pg||

nt|athene: the idea is you can draw trumps and keep control of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that applied here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: he has virtually no defense to 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although looking at 3@d and 3@S you would guess puppet stayman |pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@c asks for 5M or 5422 shape|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart return he will test clubs and then maybe run the @DJ into north for a second avoidance play|pg||
nt|athene: still guarding those spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 3@d denies 5m4M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they should put that on their CC for us poor old commentators :) |pg||
nt|athene: if the defence now play ace and a spade, of course declarer can afford to run the @DJ|pg||
nt|athene: @CQ would have saved a trick; now declarer can lead a heart to the queen then duck a heart and get a club pitch on the @HK|pg||
nt|tez: bence 2 @s verip batacak|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: A @C lead will leave the lead in dummy  and -1; otherwise lead will go to hand and make - I predict|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kemperg: 1down on @S play now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: probably expected QJ10 in S, with the 9 in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i'm a bit surprised at versace showing the minors actually|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a 3nt raise to me|pg||
nt|kemperg: A and Q|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: you mean declarer's natural play is to lead a small trump from whichever hand he finds himself in at trick 2?|pg||
nt|ady: swing could go either way|pg||
nt|athene: i think it is just about 50-50 to be honest|pg||
nt|athene: of course madala is not expecting the @CK to be onside|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's surely below 50%|pg||
nt|athene: he's wondering whether to overtake this, ruff the last heart, then play a small club |pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps 8 now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, at least he will be happy when he finds the bad break now - it means there is a chance 5@S can gain imps|pg||
nt|gsper:  The low @H showed even number without honor or odd with|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lets say well bid -no real idea if they were aware about possible @c slam -not this time ofcause |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: the defence would then have time to set up a diamond trick but that might be ok|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but in hindsight N does not need so much to make a slam so 3@D better than my 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: now S just has to untangle it |pg||
nt|sybarra: that works |pg||
pc|dK|nt|runnerup:  i think you always make this but easyer now ofcause|pg||
nt|tez: @d 10 oynamasý defansýn biraz ipucu veriyor|pg||

pc|hA|nt|sharkey: So much for preditions...|pg||
nt|ady: was that 480    or 450|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kemperg: loser on loser|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://clubs.vugraph.com/tbricfed/teams_round.php?round=4771  for standings before this match|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: the lead gives declarer an easy ninth trick from diamonds but she would have been ok on a club lead anyway i guess - play spades|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have been given a link: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt |pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: ok, so NS play strong @c system, sry I came late did not realise|pg||
nt|athene: good play from bocchi; putting a lot of pressure on west if he has something like @HAxxx|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: NS Leads are Slavinsky (standard count with an honour in the suit & reverse count without an honour).|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: he might worry that north has @HQJ doubleton so he might go in with the ace second time|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: and lo, it says 3C = asks 5-crd major or 5422, not used if just looking for 4-4 fit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: interesting sort of squeeze here|pg||
nt|athene: if north throws a diamond declarer can't go wrong really|pg||
nt|athene: but if he throws a heart, south has to throw a spade, and then it becomes safe to take the diamond finesse anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm sorry that is not quite correct, as east will presumably throw a heart anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so then south can throw a heart and it is not quite safe to finesse diamonds through north|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's what my copy of the CC says. Might be out-of-date of course|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: hard for east to know it was diamonds, not clubs, he should have been attacking|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: made +1 if switched to @D ??|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: but then as a spec points out you can cash two hearts|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At Bocchi's table the lead was @CQ - so he couldnt|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|nt|athene: yes i was wondering if they had changed their methods and 3@S forced 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely tho|pg||
nt|mdgraham: never been convinced of the auction 2NT-3NT being conventional|pg||

nt|athene: ok, i guess he did finesse, but of course makes anyway after no spade shift|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @h with 7 isn't everyones choice|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H opener gives east a much harder task|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 3nt by S|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s diyecek|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bilgi bekliyoruz henüz ses yok kimseden|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to PS|pg||
nt|psridhar:  hi all :)|pg||
nt|psridhar:  thx Roland|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar:  that 4@c must be lead director in case they save 4@s -cant imagine Lauria trying for slam :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: i assume the pause there was west thinking, not south|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural or various strong hands; 2@S less than 8 points|pg||
nt|athene: you might just bid 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: non vul, @h sequence, some shape & values on the side, a clear 3@h bid|pg||
nt|athene: no problem in 6@S of course with the miracle diamond lie so the 7 is good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also in 5 . board 5 @c X -100 like expected -over 4 @h  =6 imps|pg||
nt|athene: but even if south had a higher diamond he would get squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|athene: unless it was diamond lead and diamond continuation after the trump, i suppose|pg||
nt|runnerup:  12 in @s|pg||
nt|psyck: making a slam is the best way to beer|pg||
nt|athene: yes, making a slam with the @D7 having squeezed someone is definitely a good beer|pg||
nt|queequeg: @s@S ====== Running Scores ====== @S@S|pg||
nt|tez: @s kesiyorum..elim iyi.zon oynayalým mý?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@C lead directing?|pg||
nt|kingcur: N grabbing the bite instantly here...and he should with all those controls|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: the EW misunderstanding here is a variation on a common theme:- when do you count a short minor opening as a "bid suit" and when not?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In the other room W opened a weak NT and East bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: if diamonds have been bid already, then 4@D is not forcing|pg||
nt|ady: good swing for Zaleski here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for 3@D with four-card trump support?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if north opens 3 @h -what is east bid?|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|tez: zon derken..kutsal kontratý|pg||
nt|tez: 3 NT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: I wonder what type hand West would bid 1 NT second time - may be conventional?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: running scores at http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|danilo1: Toni must (will) make one more bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu arada bu kontrat olacak gibi duruyor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seyircilerden gelen cevap : A grubundan 8, B grubundan 2 takým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yarýn final oynayacak|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: 2@h=maximum without majors or 4@h|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are to fast for me PS :)|pg||
nt|psridhar:  pity Decl has both QJ , else Versace might hv managed @d ruff AND a promotion|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: in this auction where a suit agreed and we are past 4nt, i play 5NT is key card (probably i am alone :()|pg||
nt|fabsayc: alternatively 5NT should say he is interested in 7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: very scenic miht o overboard|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess with three jacks it's a bit aggressive :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: not easy for Versace, @H 31 an @S A on other side and then its contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: if you play splinters as I do,  I have good cards in the "out side suit"  should the exact hand you are looking at  |pg||
nt|kemperg: nice 4@C instead of 1S|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: still choices to make|pg||
nt|kingcur: brb phone, sorry|pg||
nt|psyck: this one does not have as much play complications as last one thoufg|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: 2nt was GF balanced, asking about minors; i assume 3@D showed five clubs|pg||
nt|athene: and south got mildly interested|pg||
nt|tez: normal 1 batýþ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: well as i said it is difficult - you might just bid 3nt |pg||
nt|psyck: same i suppose dbl planning 3N on 3M|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but if partner bid lets say 4 @c ?|pg||
nt|athene: you might double but that will often just give you a hard problem later on|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jaapfr: 4nt with @D lead can create big problems so better 5@C for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: one can not develop both majors with @D lead so if @D lead doomed|pg||
nt|psyck: unless he playes 2@s for a pitch immed which is not going to hap[pen|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: ok i'm told 3@D was a 5-card minor, 3@H asked, 3@S showed clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 3@H was equivalent of jump after 2@D response|pg||
nt|tez: küçük @h|pg||
nt|tez: @s ten batmasý zor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu formatta oynanan turnuvada B grubuna düþmek, damdan düþmekten daha kötüdür|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu maça baþlamadan önceki sýralama http://clubs.vugraph.com/tbricfed/teams_round.php?round=4765|pg||
nt|psyck: as he has late entries to dummy for that|pg||
nt|kemperg: in trouble now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jaapfr: i really miss why to lead @H as W|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with a less solid suit he would pass or double|pg||
nt|danilo1: opps, Danger now ... guess Toni bid too much with 5NT |pg||
nt|sybarra: he can not pitch the 4 of  @H |pg||
nt|psyck: these was no harm in trying J 1st round, he could always enter dummy with @c ruff or something|pg||
nt|sybarra: yet |pg||
nt|kemperg: and cannot ruff it|pg||
nt|psyck: @hJ...|pg||
nt|psyck: @dJ i meant|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, he needs his ruff, so cannot afford to lose trump now|pg||
nt|psyck: *ruffs|pg||
nt|kemperg: not enough entries|pg||
nt|sybarra: was there a good reason not to go in with J of @D?|pg||
nt|psyck: he can play @hA now & start ruffing, he can ruff 2nd @s high later|pg||
nt|psyck: that would take care of entry problems for ruffs|pg||
nt|kemperg: might play for @S 33|pg||
nt|psyck: if he lets it run, then down on 2nd trump|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: endplay coming up....draw trumps in 2, ruff the spade, exit diamond|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gsper:  Therefore the double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but this looks like one too many cue bids to me|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Have East denied @DK?|pg||
nt|danilo1: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Lauria will lead a trump back |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Should make now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: Can duck this|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: yes, duck this looks simplest, then just draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need to guess the hearts or anything|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West did not think so|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: 4@Sx by north in open room|pg||
nt|psridhar:  Versace possibly judged it wd be -1 at most , no x|pg||
nt|psyck: nice, he may make now|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok here we go |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: if you draw trumps you don't have a dummy entry, but when you lead the @H10, east has a tricky decision |pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: you might have started with @HA10 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: now the double squeeze is pretty much marked|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: cash @CK, ruff a heart, and then run the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and whoever has the diamonds will have to unguard them|pg||
nt|athene: not actually a double squeeze as only one person can guard them but that is how you play it|pg||
nt|psyck: well we don't get dealt such 24 everyday, so i don't like to just bid 3N, I will x & take my medicine on pd's rebid|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south has 3 @h normally|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|gsper:  A bit lucy. Exchange the EW @H and it is down|pg||
nt|tez: batýnca kavga etmek gerekmiyor..|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|danilo1: after Giorgio bid 4@H on 4@C ... maximum Sementa should make was ... one more bid = correct 5@D ... and after 5@S - just 6@H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: agree|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|athene: wondering whether to overtake and lead a club up|pg||
nt|athene: if you play low here and then another heart, east has to win and play a small diamond to give you a problem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sanki yapar gibi idi ama batara gelmiþ|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: you can put in the 8, capture the jack or 10, and play a diamond back|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Babela: ponele robot freeze en el refund|pg||
nt|mrace: selam Murat, hi all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|queequeg: @s@S ====== Running Scores ====== @S@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: so most of the time you can force the defence to open up clubs anyway|pg||
nt|queequeg: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|psyck: moment of truth|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzdp: oyuncular ara verdi |pg||
nt|MolvaM: hoþgeldin timuçin erkoç|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha  and ruffs up |pg||
nt|psyck: made now|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chances |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|athene: i guess 3nt played by north is probably the best contract, but as the cards lie, no-one was going down, of course|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes that has a lot of chances :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice play:)|pg||
