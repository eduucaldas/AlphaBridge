nt|snorre: Gazilli is a convention after 1M - 1NT as far as I know|pg||
nt|andersk: 2@C is a normal bid from Berg, but IF that is conventional 15+ hand, he have to bid 3 @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kidding about HCP counting -- the south hand is much stronger than 4321 count suggests|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: 2N was a relay -- but didn't promise points  [no kidding]|pg||

nt|bobholl: Make 90%|pg||

mb|r|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|sunsamvar: anyone for 2@H instead of dbl with the west hand?|pg||
nt|baldjean: Elinscu will switch to a red suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|po-s: I don´t think so|pg||

nt|ahollan1: will be less tempting for Elinescu in context of limited opening bid|pg||
