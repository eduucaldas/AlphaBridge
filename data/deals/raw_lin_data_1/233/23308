mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|clinch: no, true enough :)|pg||

nt|grebrof: Ns shape you should bid again, no matter what S has - in my mind|pg||
nt|psyck: some play BROMAD, bergen raises after x|pg||
nt|grebrof: say you should...|pg||
nt|grebrof: Bergen raises is bad enough as it is - now some do that too? hehe|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 2N was a relay -- but didn't promise points  [no kidding]|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: Thats true, however many play 1 @D as 4+ @D and therefore play 2 @C as Gazilli over 1 @D openings too|pg||

nt|vugraphzdd: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC-2012/12_05_16_team.html for running scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Oja  1@D=(9)11-16 HCP, not 5+@H/@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 0+@D|pg||
nt|runnerup:  now there is a cahnce to stop under game|pg||
nt|runnerup:  chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically  Nunes would have to stretch with 1@S|pg||
nt|lokaty: it should bring them 2 imos:)|pg||
nt|po-s: A bit aggressive by Nunes - and the opposite by North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but about a Queen short of the 12/13 with both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: 4@h 10 tricks is a good result for the danish...  Let us see if Norway can do the same...|pg||
nt|snorre: a normal Norwegian bidding.. :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzee: erkel löve çalmaya oynayacaktýr|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: Roland -- my issue would be  the pure majors and only 5 losers|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess many would open 1S|pg||
nt|po-s: five losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the key problem for Nunes   if he opens 1@s it is FORCING|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of the day    tomorrow schedule showing viewer's local timezone  http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|lokaty: to reach here 4@H is very difficult:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|snorre: A boring one...   3NT/4@h both easy to bid/win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-14, 1+@D|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@h looks twmtong here for N|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|snorre: looks like Norway win 2@s on B22. 4 IMP probably|pg||
nt|baldjean: teempting*|pg||
nt|baldjean: tempting*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will be less tempting for Elinescu in context of limited opening bid|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psyck: @h to 9 fetched in the 9th trick here|pg||
nt|lokaty: 1@C most propably 15+, but still to get in to the game imposibblke|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: per CC   i think 3@D=4441@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-11 hcp, 4+@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=forcing  a) 4+@H, 14-20 HCP  b) 23+ NT|pg||
