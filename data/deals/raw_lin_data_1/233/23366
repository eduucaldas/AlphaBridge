mb|p|nt|baldfriede: or maybe I am mistaken|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that is not how the players seem to experience it|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petka:  not that Gronkvist-Rimstedt are moving to the retirement home in the near future either|pg||
nt|nilsland:  NS dont make 3N here|pg||
nt|bt: this is a pretty good 5@C but 2 finesses off, and no @CK singleton in west|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hi everyone and welcome back to Örebro where the Swedish Teams Championships take place|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Welcome back! We're doing these 12 boards before midnight here in Örebro|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Pass alerted? so it is some kind of forcing pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And neither am I :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: It denied 3-c supp in @S (which double promised at least four of)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East has shown @S + @C with his 2@S-bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2:  How come that so many teams were penalised in the first round?|pg||
nt|bt: 4@H has a play maybe|pg||
nt|bt: yes thats interesting, whats with the penalties?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Also welcome to Germ Kemper|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW play strong club|pg||
nt|oliverc: At least West had the sense to stop low|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi  Mikael and all|pg||
nt|mamos:  North has balanced 22 so would expect \\S to o on to game  ah yes  3@c presumably major ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  So this was a good decision by Cilla|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  loks like puppet|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I'm guessing this is a puppet Stayman sequence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: there was a very simliar board in the last set with the same suit distribution, but W held A@h. that confused me|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Hi all and welcome to Örebro|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is the second half of the fourth match in the Swedish teams championships|pg||

pc|h9|nt|sunsamvar: shd be puppet|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS play an odd system, strong club with trf-openings|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2:  http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q  for running scores|pg||
nt|kemperg: not easy , good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Well, North decided to put the dummy down before the lead was made :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  so N shows a  4 card major and South shows Spades  (by bifdding Hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/Yoda.pdf for their convention card (in Swedish)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos:  and strong hand is declarer :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: looks like he will lose 1@D and 1@H thanks to the lucky lie in diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzft: NS plays strong club with 5c M-openings|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@c being a GF relay in this sequence|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos:  and everything  down to @d98 doubleton is about as helpful as it could be|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/LeMiJo.pdf for EW's which is a more straightforward Precision-based system|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bt: a diamond back at trick 2 would have made it interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS play very natural with 4c openings. 2@h showed 6+@h and 10-14|pg||

nt|bt: does anyone live in the northern most part of denmark? i hard all those who could read followed the sign to copenhagen|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: For running scores, visit: http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q|pg||
nt|mamos:  East will bepleased with the outcome of that board|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It would have taken a misguess in spades as well as one in clubs for declarer to go down|pg||
nt|oliverc: definitely|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  An old-fashioned 2@s bid here.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @c finesse works here, but it is not enough for a slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2:  We have a sign in the Copenhagen harbour, it reads: "Keep Denmark tidy, see a Swede to the ferry"|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both pairs play strong club though their methods are slightly different|pg||
nt|bt: yea and half the danes can even read it |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but +110 is not bad|pg||

nt|bt: systems are here: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2632|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I had a look at the convention card of N/S, but it is in Swedish, and all I understand is Smörgasbröd. :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and maybe N/S won't even be in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: another possible 3NT NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Dbl was for penalty according to East|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzeg: Possible as in "you make if you bid it"|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  hmmmm|pg||
nt|kemperg: dealer is not very kind for us:(|pg||
nt|baldfriede: though I would certainly clear my throat with some bid now as N|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so 1@D is 4+ @H and 6-16 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H a relay with 0-7 hcp or 13+|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: :) They play a short club with transfer responses and three weak twos|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Friede|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW doesn't rate to make much here, NS should manage about 4@D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzeg: You have to stay out of 5 of either minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7 or 17+, hence the rest of their openings are placed somewhere in between|pg||
nt|bt: brb|pg||
nt|oliverc: How does that come to be in their CC?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5@h is a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgi:  round 5 updated - http://bridge.bg/ranking1054.html|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Most play it as pass with spades, correct with hearts|pg||
nt|kemperg: negative I think|pg||
nt|kemperg: as Roland explains|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  This is about to go 4 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  5@C does not make|pg||
nt|mamos:  what was 2@C?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd not bid 2@C here|pg||
nt|mamos:  strange|pg||
nt|baldfriede: neither would I|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or 10-12 with support|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Sorry?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5-2-2-4 normally is 1 @s but Wrang thougth otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I agree with the NT-opening, it might be wrong but it simplifies the auction so much|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|mamos:  no reson not  to pas  1NT IMHO|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  N-s would appear to lose a @s and a @c in any suit contrat.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|georgi:  ranking updated + teams roster|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS  abit unlucky here in that South's values are mostly no help|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@C was Stayman, but didn't promise a major|pg||
nt|baldfriede: so a kind of garbage stayman?|pg||
nt|mamos:  garbage is the word|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think 1NT shows @C and 2@S is natural with the strong hand|pg||
nt|po-s: clearly not 0-7...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|georgi:  http://bridge.bg/ranking1054.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT was 1 down, this has a chance|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Smörgasbröd comess with everything in Sweden :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@C has put the brakes on|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzeg: ... and NS had no problem getting to the right spot|pg||
nt|oliverc: They play the Smörgasbörd 2@D?|pg||
nt|mamos:  not an easy lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a 3-3 @S fit = garbage i suppose :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Other than @ss, of course.)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and NT is totally impossible|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@c is a bit tricky with a spade lead too though|pg||
pc|s8|nt|runnerup:  3nt is coffee board I am not criticising just telling what i saw|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petka:  the tempo in this bidding worked well for NS. The only one who might feel a bid "underbid" is south, with some extras in her hand|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|po-s: slam is making?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: perhaps, but it's not one you would like to be in|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos:  how would he proceed after 2@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if you chose your third suit as trump that is|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kemperg: 4@C ruff|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|po-s: before or after?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzft: A trump shift might induce North to take the finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I wonder too. garbage stayman works best with longer @d instead with lonfer @c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2:  Now 5 down if they take all their tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|runnerup:  if you bid you'll make it |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: neither|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|baldfriede: On a lucky day this would be a slam. And this is a lucky day because it is right-sided.|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|nilsland:  East will have no problem making this|pg||
nt|petka:  perhaps they play something artificial after a 1N intervention? so that her choice was pass or 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they don't|pg||
nt|mamos:  4-4 major fits are so important|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS doesn't make game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = @H + @C, minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 2@S = good-looking hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Funny thing you mention that. Been a lot of discussion in the swedish forums about how rude it is to make your cc's in english rather than swedish|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos:  south has overbid  in myopinion|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: w/o @H lead it can make i thk|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: yes, that's true. Diamonds are 3-3 so it might be possible to make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Win with the king, cash the ace of spades and play four rounds of diamonds pitching two hearts?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|baldfriede: 4@h appears to be asking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H= rkc ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: For specs on bbo however, english is obviously prefered|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3NT is the contract i would like to be in with the EW cards|pg||
mb|5C|nt|runnerup:  east migth run to 2 @s but it makes 3nt a good contract -finess =|pg||
nt|mamos:  if North cues Clubs they surely will|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: no, it's just a cuebid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: apparently, and S showed 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They've just have a standard cuebidding auction where North will correct 6@D to 6NT because of his lack of trump support|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, ok, a cuebid then. but that should help @s|pg||
nt|po-s: North and South live so far apart that they wouldn´t understand eah other´s dialects|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, for me it is certainly easier to have it in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here they have wrongsided the contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c has some extra chances -6 nt you have to finess in rigth red suit |pg||
mb|d|nt|runnerup:  8 in nt -no hope higher and doubled perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think West had bid out his shape and that there was little point in removing 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  this lead helps a bit|pg||
nt|kemperg: need a crossruff, but has to make a @D trick first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do they know i keycard is missing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: maybe not now though|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Cruff, 3 rounds of @Ds to pitch a @H and then enter in @SA to ruff 4th @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to Peder Linder, North has shown a good slam try with 6+ @C and singleton @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|baldfriede: 6Nt wil be down though on a @c lead|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||

nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cuebids are fine but i thk S shd take control with rkc at some point|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5NT was RKC|pg||
nt|runnerup:  po-s idea north should tranfer to @c and suth with good hand bids 3 @c now south is declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: sex sang går väl bra|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Which is strengthed by North's explanations|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oliverc: fast claim here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i mean N can have a similar hand with the @Ca instead of the kj.. then 7 is cold|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: Bertheau-Larsson have a huge score on 15 with +400 NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: We apologize for the delays. Hopefullt everything will work from now on!|pg||
nt|bt:  on board 1 ns at the other table gor all the way to 6@C which isnt impossible, luckily for them they will go 2 down|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so proved to be too difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: now that would be interesting!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: only if you can proe that the 12 apostles used to play bridge at 3 tables :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Make jobs for translaters.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras won 11 imps on board 1 when 3NT went down in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 10 more imps for Sivve since NS in the other room reasonably ducked game|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: with that, n might have bid 6c over 5nt|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kemperg: interesting opening|pg||
nt|mamos:  loks like a partscore board |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the opening lead was a more successful diamond that removed West's entry to the hearts|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7/ 17+, the rest being artificial as well|pg||
nt|bt: lets see what mr bergdahl decides here, he is creative :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS only have one loser but do not make slam with the bad brakes|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzeg: sorry, +400 EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: N to take the safe?|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT for EW?|pg||
nt|oliverc: looks like a fairly straightforward 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: as I said, 5NT was RKC and 6@D showed 0/3|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|kemperg: means @H Jxxx and @C Jxxxx|pg||
nt|rodal f: If -1 3NT can be problematic NS. If NS have a safe 3NT they often make 500|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, Stayman instead of transfer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think these guys play the NT-system made by former pair Upmark/Cullin|pg||
nt|bt: ns are lucky to find their fit at all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if west playes for @d to be nicely he has 4 such -by ducking but still only 8 if defenders see the situation|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzeg: missed spade-fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@d = 8-11 4M4+m/bal/55+ ms|pg||
nt|bt:  unusual, think this is close to a minimum, even in a very positive mindset|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so they knew what they were doing :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that is what happened, West (who is a she in the open room btw) ducked but the defence didn't give her a chance|pg||
mb|5H|nt|petka:  here is one reason for transfer responses. Playing transfers east could show 44 majors non-forcing with 1C-1D-1H-1S|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If NS atack @H in time they will beat this|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Unless declarer finds to endplay N|pg||
nt|kemperg: thks kib, 4@H , 5)minor, 3010 pts|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3-10|pg||
nt|runnerup:  dangerous opening bid -of course difficult for opponent also ,but even here when south has so good hand 3 @h maybe too high|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Solves the "jobs problem" and convention-card misunderstanding in 1 fell swoop.|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|mamos:  2@S will have attracted the best lead but I dont like bidding there on that|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: all about picking up clubs, which he will do|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that brave 2@D bid has pushed E/W overboard here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@s being invitational with 5 spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is a figth .migth end on losing level|pg||
nt|bt: arent they already?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos:  wow North has faith in his partner's NV overcall|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup:  yes but you have to make rigth thing to beat 5 @s|pg||
nt|bt: i think ns did very well to find their fit here, lets see what he does. playing on diamonds after being shortened in dummy doesnt look likely|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nilsland:  So best in to play @H before taking the clubs - difficult thou|pg||
nt|mamos:  nope its pushed  NS overboard as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think North bid great, I wouldn't have overcalled 2@D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos:  NS did need to get into the action somehow |pg||
nt|mamos:  but needed to know when to stop pushing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: a balanced hand with 10 hcp is not a two level overcall, non-vul or not|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|baldfriede: unfortunate lay-out here|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: as so often is the case, the five-level belonged to the opponents|pg||
nt|runnerup:  very rigth|pg||
nt|bt: the 9th spade was missing unfortunately|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: anybodys lead, small from QJxxx?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2 down non-vulnerable and undoubled is a very reasonable score here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: anyway, 3@D is also down|pg||
nt|po-s: an unblock would have been better|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|bt:  now maybe south shouldnt invite knowing they have a 8card fit and maximum 23 hcp?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice def|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East doesn't look very happy right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: don't know if it's cause partner's thinking or because he thinks he made an error himself|pg||

nt|runnerup:  26 hcp but just 1nt in cards -rare case|pg||
nt|runnerup:  okk 8|pg||
nt|bt: he passed and after another double he bid 5@D which will go one down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|oliverc: Surely he had enough of a count to know North couldn't possibly have the K@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|underdogg:  2@c = 8-11 5+@c|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Great 4@s bid.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hmmm.  2@c would seem obvious for s.  Do they play non-forcing free bids?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nilsland:  EW will play 3N|pg||
nt|bt:  the famous 13-15, very unusual today. some people does not stayman w 4333|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Now NS are at a dangerous 3NT it seems.|pg||
nt|mamos:  i imagine this is some kind of three card rtaise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both these pairs play strong club which is ever so popular in Sweden|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Negative free bids)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  So, as of the 5 level, their slam potential suit hasn't been mentioned.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H was alerted on South's side of the screen as showing spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North was told it was natural (obviously)|pg||
nt|bt: south has an enormous hand here on this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the +500 in 5@C X earned Team Zang 11 imps when NS played 2@H -1 in the open room|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petka:  the idea is that after 1C-1red-1M-1N west does not have to guess to bid 2C with 5+, and also that the stronger hand gets the NT. with the transfer approach the weak hand often is declarer, as in 1C-red(transfer)-relay-1N|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Which cna be made playing on clubs|pg||
nt|petka:  ok, nough about that, but many specs were wondering|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rodal f: Moisant might the best, tough EW are 4-2 in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... it is now being introduced|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now it sounds like a queue bid in support of @ds?|pg||
nt|po-s: better than 5H|pg||
nt|po-s: if you play neg free bids this sounds more like clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: and can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he also plays precision so he's limited to 16 hcp|pg||
mb|d|nt|bt:  i wrote that before he bid :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  looks a noemal 4 @h = ,coffee board-but no 3nt it is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal|pg||
nt|kemperg: I hate bidding NT having a 4333|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if it was it was singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: (given the 2@S overcall)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  i think the west hand is far too good for 13-15|pg||
nt|baldfriede: then he must havee miscounted @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Wd, they got there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Yoda gained 15 imps on the last board when their EW-pair got a gift in the shape of 4@cX making|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 11 tricks even|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  910 isn't a score you see every day!|pg||
nt|po-s: as long as declarer doesn´t take two spade ruffs and then tries to establish hearts rather than use his diamonds this should come home|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: how would you play the board, PO?|pg||
nt|po-s: must admit I´m a bit influenced by seeing all the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: my partners alwayshave a hand like W|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nilsland:  3@D is only inviting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: on this board, for example, EW's style will give South a harder opening lead problem|pg||
nt|mamos:  it seems unlikely that declarer can go wrong here|pg||
nt|bt: some would upgrade here :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzft: Everyone's waiting for north to make the lead...|pg||
nt|po-s: ruff, then club finesse?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzeg: which she didn't have to consider :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3@D is actually worse than 3N|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|oliverc: good grief :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Missed game here by NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: oops - 3n laydown|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = 4+ @S, 2NT = signoff somewhere|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt icecold.. 5@C depended on keeping @D losers to 1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if south playes precision he has 1 @c opening |pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzft: I think South was worth one more try with her eight tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|po-s: now the danger is spade ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|baldfriede: are we watching ladies?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes but @d must be set up before the 2nd trump|pg||
nt|mamos:  he will havwe worries because if this finesse had failed and there been another force life might have got very sticky|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|oliverc: hi again everyone|pg||
pc|s3|nt|po-s: ok, now he will probably go for D|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Larsson-Berthaeu now in the lead since Grönkvist-Forsberg let 2@D through on 15|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes 4 @h migth make -@s Ace and @s -KJ in @h and @d -@s ruff and more @d -now west out of @s -and makes -but not easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he could have ditched a club on the heart return though|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: then pitch another on the queen later|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|runnerup:  obviously 450 in this case|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: I think South is all to blame, she could have tried 3@H over 2NT or 3@D|pg||
nt|baldfriede: because you said S was a she|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: major suit battle here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South is a female, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@D did not go only one down on board 4, it went three down doubled|pg||

nt|rodal f: Still the warning came by 3NT, but team and IMPs cost.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: passing the buck|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would have chosen 2NT over 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Any thoughts?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Might go overboard here.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i thk W was right in pushing his p to bid nt in view of his black suit holding|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|underdogg:  since 1NT would have been 21-23, 2NT should show 24-25 something :)|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt best here but may end up in 4@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nilsland:  Interersting pass by N - very disciplined|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West can make 2 H but N may try 2N|pg||
nt|kemperg: no dbl , only 2@Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  how wrong I was - 1 @s wasn't in my mind -double perhaps was ,,not perfect double of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT might be Raptor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@h is a constructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You're quite right|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  I wonder if double is for penalties here? Or is it takeout?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  should be penalties|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: They haven't played with each other for long so I don't know if they have discussed it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Rimstedt-Grönkvist leading, both other tables made 3NT on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Their cc doesn't mention any unusal 1NT-overcall that I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/TA1.pdf|pg||
nt|bt:  you are right|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/cpx9t65 for running scores of all matches|pg||
nt|bt: i agree on passing 1@S, but bergdahl rarely chooses the "normal" bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  if south passes he bids 1@s and later 2 @s|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wygbe1: cheap save in 4d over 3n for ns|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: what about 6@c on this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a standard 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petka:  If this is it, then W must be careful to start with a low heart to the 9. But w must also set up the spades without aloowing a ruff in north hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Declarer may misplay it thou - you must duck the club|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: W knows E has @C lenght and cd have bid the vul 3 nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bye all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  east has bad suit but so much that he didn't want to pass -common situation with 5 @c -very dangerous but many bids -life is dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2NT is a rather nice bid, correctly interpreted it will lead to 3@D making|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i dont believe that ew will find @d -lets see|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oliverc: On best defence, 3@S the limit here, but easy enough for NS to let 4@S through,|pg||
nt|oliverc: though, especially if South tries to cash @D tricks rather than leading their singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Why shouldn't they? There is no point in playing 2NT now as natural?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok conventional 1nt -killed that bid -now needs to stop in time -should make on 3-level |pg||
nt|baldfriede: S wonders if his 8 would be enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: making 4@S on 17 was worth another 10 imps to NS here, now ahead by 11 in the match|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oliverc: looks good, and it's right-sided now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You might misplay hearts after the overcall, perchance?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: The trap didn't fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: trump shift?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, this tells N where the @h are|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzft: South accidently dropped the jack of spades on the table. Director has been called|pg||
nt|bt:  accoridng to cc they dont play conventional 1nt|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzft: ... He is therefore forced to play the jack of spades now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  coffee one /without this opening =2@h nothing to talk |pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: 2@SX would have costed.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|runnerup:  lets say well found 1 @S then|pg||
nt|runnerup:  rigth but average pair rarely has spoken these serious |pg||
nt|runnerup:  should of cource|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is the Swedish Championship finals, average pairs shouldn't have come this far|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and even without prior discussion you can calculate what it shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I am very surprised East passed|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzft: North perhaps simply chose to make an overcall on his nice 4c suit|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I think finessing in @h won t help you much anyway|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok -sorry but lets say you have to 'nose' these places|pg||

nt|baldfriede: Only 8 tricks here, unles there is a miracle|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@C = GF relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 4@S, 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: unless*|pg||
nt|baldfriede: May be less.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if the opponents catching you is what you're worried about you should compare that to all the upsides of acting|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i dont think that it is easy to bid -claiming in declarer play is easy|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 2NT = short clubs (4531/4540)|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|petka:  the spade situation allows 3NT as well, but 4H looks like a great spot|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But there is the Chinese art of Wu Wei - acting by not acting. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: lol :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 1@S-2NT, 4@H (void)-4NT, 5@H-6@S would be a rather standard sequence to the top spot|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so in a good day 6 @d |pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Declarer dont know who has the @DA so will maybe play for clubs|pg||

nt|runnerup:  this is not a good day|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|nilsland:  and could go down then|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: if South, like North, thought 4@H promised a void|pg||

mb|4N!|nt|petka:  after 2S and showing AKxxxx spades I guess she knows where the DA is :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  So South should play another spade|pg||

nt|bt: they|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: i haven't had the chance to read what 3@D is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north is very weak for opening and south optimist|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4@C set @D, 4@D = minimum, 4@H RKC, 4NT = 1/4 and 5@C asked for the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|bt: north has an opening hand in most systems, except roth-stone|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|nilsland:  and look like a woman with the @DA|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: So here we have the last board of this match. The second match will start 20:00 local time, in 1 1/2 hour|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i also agree with the no|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: :) South's defence cost his team a lot|pg||
nt|mamos:  its been a great set of boards   lots and lots of close hands and some great play and some less great|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Okay, here we have the last board of this segment|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A very quiet set this, impwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 14-10 to Yoda|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the slam of two aces was a push against 5@S -1 at the other table (after a club lead with South as declarer)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|nilsland:  Larsson - Bertheau bid and made 6 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thank you!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yeah, the last board for tonight coming up. Tomorrow we have another three matches for you|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes, but I can't help feel that Ace and another Heart was indicated there|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the moral of this set seems to be -- play 3nt whenever possible|pg||
nt|friggi: I disagree - as a matter of desperation you should:)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3S!|nt|vugraphzft: Thanks everyone for watching, thanks to the commentators|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: +400 is a big result for Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|friggi: 4NT?|pg||
nt|mamos:  a friend of mine once told me that it was often a good idea to redouble because it was much harder to defend then  the defenders were less confident and more likely to err|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to imagine a 6 IMP swing to NS from here|pg||
nt|mamos:  its possible |pg||
nt|oliverc: possible but unlikely :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -this looks like 3nt ew so ew migth evenlise this match |pg||
mb|d|nt|oliverc: help BUT feel... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i just checked and it wasn't, declarer simply got 11 tricks when West ruffed air in clubs and cashed the ace of spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup:  ctually 5 @D was off -but west helped -under leading @S ace was nothing but when he took 2 tricks by ruffing and @S Ace .his partner had Q and he 10 in @D if he sees to switch to @S his partner ruffs with Q and his 10 will beat 5 @D but no he|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: great 4@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this contract looks like one down for 8 more imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  at board 8 -4 @s was made @d lead and small @d to get ruff(s) -not best idea -8 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or, now it's a make|pg||
nt|oliverc: or making|pg||
nt|turnip1:  just made...|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  switched to @d and 10 and Q fall together|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/resultat/damer/trial3.htm for the results, table will be kept open until we know who qualified|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks Rodal and Ida|pg||
nt|runnerup:  she sorry |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kemperg: and of coarse the specs ty all|pg||
nt|oliverc: K@S was obviously singleton and Declarer cannot pick up Kxxx in the South hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzft: We'll be back tomorrow at 10:00 local time, in roughly 10h30m|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 12 tricks with this lead|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not this time -tx bye|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the slam dont make|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: we would like to thank Tofta Gård (our playing venue) for the magnificent service and help we've gotten|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d3|nt|friggi: S did well not to bid on|pg||
nt|baldfriede: double fame swing on the final board|pg||
nt|turnip1:  5 D making|pg||
nt|baldfriede: game*|pg||
nt|oliverc: why not? 5@D is cold|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|nilsland:  should not make THAT IS:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on  6 NS overbid to 4@S going one down and thereby giving Sivves 5 imps|pg||
nt|mamos:  rapid tempo at this table = 12 boards in less than one hour|pg||
nt|oliverc: tough contract, this|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|friggi: just becaus the K is on side|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so Larsson-Bertheau have a huge last board|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|runnerup:  west isn't very ambitious -pass to 1 @s isn't  everybodys choice|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kemperg: bye|pg||
nt|rodal f: U are right Germ. Sorry:(  Forgot the specs.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nilsland:  maybe some squeeze against N|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oliverc: I accept that, but there's not much room for East to have the K@D after West opens|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so you don't want to be in a game on a finesse over an opening hand?|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|h6|nt|friggi: my bid was 4NT|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx all|pg||
