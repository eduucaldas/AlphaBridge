pc|d7|pc|h4|pc|cQ|nt|jcwla:  High-level competitive auctions are some of the hardest in bridge. Rather than try to get every close decision exactly right on the particular layout of the cards, aim always to make bids that will at worst be reasonable (i.e., within a trick).|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla:  When you open light in third seat, do so in the suit you want led.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  There is a huge inference to lead partner's third seat bid suit. If you choose a different suit, you'd better be right.|pg||

pc|d7|nt|jcwla:  So often it's right to make the lead in the sneak attack suit.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Right, when you have less than this you have to choose a "least bad" suit bid rather than 1NT. The N hand represents a minimum for the action.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  But it's pretty clear. NS also know E may have been frolicking about with the 1@S bid.|pg||
nt|bobholl: they probably lead 2/4 than west has a decision to make (guess K and @ST back)|pg||
