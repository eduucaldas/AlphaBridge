nt|baldjean: But a phantom save is possible too.|pg||
nt|murat e: hi good morning everybody|pg||
nt|baldfriede: an interesting board to start with. E/W may well go too high here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Esperemos ver bridge y un juego limpio por parte de ambos equipos.|pg||
nt|grebrof: http://german-bridge-trophy.de/|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: The first match begins with the last year winners Poland playing against Monaco|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: 3@H was perhaps questionable with secondary minor values only|pg||
nt|bobholl: probably hoped on a NV save|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@h not a strong bid certainly, making 4@h questionable to me|pg||
nt|geot: Hi:) So this will be the "final" of the group, Norway 10 VPs ahead of Germany. |pg||
nt|geot: Norway can afford to lose 19-11 and still be in the final|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: Norway is the leader of Group A, Germany II is second with 15VP distance to Norway|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=10+ HCP, bal|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3nt often go home here|pg||
nt|psyck: yes & with this trump break, 3N is even preferable to 3@d|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|grebrof: if N plays trumps now, you can only ruff one @c in the short hand|pg||

nt|clinch: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzee: erkel oynamadý trefl pasý geçiyorsa 5 olur dedi|pg||
nt|torosyukse:  murat muhtemelen slem icin acik tutmaya calisti|pg||
mb|3D|nt|grebrof: well, I cant see that 3@d was invitational anyway, but ok|pg||
nt|psyck: one only opens with lighter hcp when there are compensating factors, so you still treat it as a normal opening|pg||
nt|geot: There might be a spade guess if West is ducking spade to the king, so.....well I think it is just a partscore to be honest|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: it seems we had a little transmission delay here|pg||
nt|geot: the @CA must be onside as well, and trumps not 4-1|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Open Room began with  3   that's strange|pg||
mb|4D|nt|grebrof: with 10hp, I tend to have 5-5/6-4 or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is a good contract... odds on with normal breaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I agree - 4@s|pg||
nt|clinch: Quick claim coming|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldfriede: this may be costly|pg||
nt|baldfriede: with this lead it makEs 4, since the @d can now be played up|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psyck: yes, he no major breaks though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|po-s: surprising choice - trump????|pg||
nt|psyck: punching declarer may be better defense|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree again|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|grebrof: weired shift|pg||
nt|baldjean: A kib mentioned 6@h might have beeen a good save since it is only 3 down But there is nothing to bid it on.|pg||
nt|bobholl: not open 3@S is asked too much :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|stc: After pass in S, 1@d, N will bid a number of @Hs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sunsamvar: surely esp with the danger of the @C suit|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|psyck: he may not be aware of the @c suit, but still he is not really going to stop @d ruffs if declarer required them by leading his singleton trump|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|runnerup:  these playes from Estonia visits often Finland when we have some nice competitions -double can be wilder than average -many doubles -when opening hand -not specially these top guys but average players playing 'rannaruutu' very common system in E|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c8|nt|murat e: it may seem that a diamond contract was there for NS but north will be shortened and trumps 4-1 so this is sure money maybe better....|pg||

nt|snorre: Welcome to the last 24 board in Bonn Nations Cup..  Norway Open vs. Poland|pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+|nt|psyck: looks like NS can make 4@h, getting there would not be easy however|pg||
nt|stc: after @d opening in W N will NOT show a two-suiter with @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14  covers many unexpected [for mortals] shapes|pg||
nt|murat e: good start for romania|pg||
nt|baldfriede: only part-score hands so far. no game here either|pg||
nt|baldfriede: very low NT here|pg||
nt|geot: his should be a standard 4@S E/W, but the mini NT may make problems for E/W?|pg||
nt|geot: this should....|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|snorre: 1NT 9-15hp 3seat green|pg||

nt|jbgood: hand for a minisplinter - not sure they play that|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: no, true enough :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N is the default bid for hands that can't open 1-suit or 2-suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ew has clearcut 140  -so how many down here perhaps -3 best def|pg||
nt|snorre: 2@d show both red|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sunsamvar: may not reach game..|pg||

nt|psyck: esp at fav vul :)|pg||
nt|stc: and the 3rd board with @hs in NS :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: which makes last board really costly|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5 point span for an NT bid? rather unusual; even 4 is rare|pg||
nt|snorre: Nilsand defence when the weak NT is doubled|pg||
nt|jbgood: N has underbid first time - but perhaps not sure whether his clubs are good enough for game|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and if N leads a @d game does not even make|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|an|odd number of aces|nt|grebrof: even at superVUL (if there is such a thing)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good 3@D bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|snorre: if Open Room type "Pass" for all boards not played, this works|pg||

nt|clinch: So 2@h Non-forcing eh|pg||
nt|baldjean: Apparently|pg||
nt|clinch: Guess they have to double on a lot of hands?|pg||
nt|bobholl: in holland it was popular some 20 years ago but not anymore|pg||

nt|geot: Declarer has no immediate entry to dummy unless he plays the ace|pg||
nt|snorre: west made what looks like a TO double over 2@d...   |pg||

nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||

pc|h5|nt|grebrof: here everything is chill, so it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: this needs a @d ruff & fav trumps...|pg||

nt|murat e: spade diccard now and then needs a club guess|pg||
nt|baldfriede: E is considering which card to trump with, 9 or Q|pg||
pc|h8|nt|po-s: well, there might be a spade lead|pg||
nt|stc: yes 3NT by S may be given by defense|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sunsamvar: and if Frey had not bid N wd surely have passed 2@H|pg||

nt|stc: 6IMP for Monaco on bo 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H max of 16 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: EW  opening 2 bids show 10-13 HCP and unbal hand -- but not allowed with both majors    and opening 1@H/@S needs better hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: a disadvantage from NF system not able to open west hand|pg||

nt|murat e: 4 hearts present no problem here only danger is going too high maybe|pg||
nt|snorre: 3NT -4 last board. A normal contract, normal lead and normal score...   :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 4 down is just normal bridge:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: Roland's favourite - 20 - 20 on the two sides|pg||
nt|jbgood: do they have a tool to find the spde fit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: aha!!   rewelcome...   :)|pg||

nt|geot: Hi Murat|pg||
nt|geot: East has a good hand, but if he does anything but bidding 4@S it will be 4@D|pg||
nt|geot: and then denying a club cuebid, so they should rest in 4@S|pg||
nt|jbgood: some play 2@c as stayman now - they too apparently|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: hi geo|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|geot: oh well:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: since 1 @c my be 2... (but wrong again)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzee: kapalý odanýnýn bilgisayýrnda küçük bir sorun oldu en kýsa zamanda geri gelecekler|pg||
nt|geot: I understand East is slam interested, but 4NT seems a little hasty (?)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: this does not really help declarer. cue bids would be better in this situation|pg||
mb|2S|nt|grebrof: the Polacks are leading anyway, due to the swing at board one where the Mongasks found 3nt|pg||
nt|snorre: 3NT maybe better than 4@h?|pg||
nt|stc: not the time to push|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H on or pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: in north i mean|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, EW are very timid, maybe waiting in bushes|pg||
mb|2N|an|12 + hcp, 4!S|nt|grebrof: where they didnt find :)|pg||
nt|stc: even 3@h is too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  2 @h is well stopped 2nt already in danger|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe they dont like to cuebid shortage in partners first suit, but then 4@H is an ok bid too|pg||
nt|geot: Only a heart lead will give declarer the contract as the diamonds are not 3-2|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sunsamvar: Classic hand for safety play in @Ss.. cash @Sa first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 3 probably|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and 3nt -2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Frey took very conservative approach with 2@H rebid|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -1 looks normal|pg||
nt|baldfriede: not true, in my opinion. only @c lead sets it. 1@d can be ruffed|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: 3+1+3+2= 9 by starting with clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: Sorry for the problems with the first 3 boards, now everything is fine....|pg||

mb|3N|an|4 !Cs|nt|tez: iyi akþamlar|pg||

mb|p|nt|murat e: this was unexpected south was afraid if north rebids spades so lost the game here|pg||
nt|geot: when West is void:=|pg||
mb|4D|nt|stc: Monaco in 5@HX on the @c slam hand|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Burn's law doubly violated|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: better diamond return i think, but might not matter|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzee: hoþgeldin tez hoca|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Buen remate de parte de villegas pidiendo la salida a @d ùnica para multar en este caso.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  FN -they dont miss defence here|pg||
nt|snorre: Svendsen doesn't lead his stiff club Ace because he has DJxx spades. Not going for ruffs with length in spades., attacking best suit is normally correct defence|pg||
nt|baldfriede: only 4 more tricks for E/W, since no communication|pg||
mb|4N|an|!H cue|nt|grebrof: 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|geot: But Berg made it simple|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|an|cue|nt|jbgood: not a big deal since 1 NT surely makes - just a question of how many down this inelegant contract goes|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|an|cue|nt|grebrof: if E ruffs a @c can play for length in @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: fantoni can't guess wheather nunes has 4 or 5@H|pg||
nt|snorre: @D before hearts best...|pg||
nt|jbgood: declarer has to play ace or else he will get tapped|pg||
nt|snorre: but doensnt matter I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|grebrof: that was if E lead the @c 9|pg||
mb|6S|nt|vugraphzdu: Mala suerte para el team Fornasari.|pg||
nt|grebrof: should keep @h ace|pg||
nt|psyck: will lose a @s, @d, & @c now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @D fin now|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s to K and a @s is better in my mind - maybe W throws some minorcard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i thk @D fin and low @S better for control|pg||
nt|geot: Poland is leading their group with this and another match to go, and the winners of the two groups will play the final later today|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldfriede: yes; may even set up a @d that way|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: other table now playing  39   you can spy on them without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c2|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1:  39  where Wladow was able to make a negative Free Bid to play 2@H    Frey used a transfer over the 1@S overcall and raised to 3@H but that ended the auction|pg||

nt|jbgood: 3 NT was a bad contract (as   2 was)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: unbal means 6+ suit or some 2-suiter   [5422 treated as bal]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: obviously they count HCP differently than we do :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  needs @c lead and 2. -then @s to beat 4 @s|pg||

nt|snorre: as you can see here. End up in a good partscore|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andersk: 3 @C max 14 and 5-5|pg||
nt|baldfriede: it is quitee useful to transfer after a double over partner's opening. if the strong hand has to lead ir often gains a trick|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|andersk: I dont know, Snorre, Im thinking loud, IF THEY play Gazil|pg||
nt|snorre: Gazilli is a convention after 1M - 1NT as far as I know|pg||
nt|andersk: 2@C is a normal bid from Berg, but IF that is conventional 15+ hand, he have to bid 3 @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kidding about HCP counting -- the south hand is much stronger than 4321 count suggests|pg||
nt|baldfriede: he may settle for 3nt though with a rather flat shape|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: 2N was a relay -- but didn't promise points  [no kidding]|pg||
nt|stc: but also didn't deny|pg||
nt|bobholl: they always are distributional when opening 2@H or@S so ??|pg||
nt|baldfriede: lost connection for a moment|pg||
nt|murat e: 8 tricks only if no surprises|pg||
pc|s6|nt|baldfriede: no, 4@h it is|pg||
pc|s5|nt|geot: I do not know for sure the agreements here, but would have thought N could bid 2H over 1D to show 12-14 and four hearts, and 1H normally = 3, so now is showing some extras|pg||
nt|geot: 25HCPs, 4-4, but difficult when trumps are so badly placed|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I see no way of making it|pg||
nt|baldfriede: especially since oppenents have 8910 in @h too|pg||
nt|geot: On the 2@H partscore (board 26) Germany found a tough 3NT and won it (club lead needed to set it)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|andersk: Thats true, however many play 1 @D as 4+ @D and therefore play 2 @C as Gazilli over 1 @D openings too|pg||

nt|po-s: old men don´t see too well|pg||
nt|murat e: i smelled some surprises and said in the beginning-if no surprises-- bridge like football is a game mistakes yielding surprises and tahat makes this game more watchable.....|pg||
mb|3H|nt|geot: Ok, this might be exciting. Although we know about a good board for Norway (the slam going down), I know about one more good one for Germany as well from the other room.... |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hmmm   2@H ostensibly   FG, 5+@H, NOT 5(332)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 3@c|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it was not a great game ck|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe some Danish dynamite here, will thay manage to bid Game?|pg||
nt|geot: True :) A normal 4@H here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well, not yet a swing, but may become one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: thats true|pg||
nt|psyck: game was good, reaching it was not clear|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@h was 10-13 or so for Fantunes|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: agrred|pg||
nt|po-s: I think it is enough to win the last trick with D7 - at least ought to be even in trumps if it is in def|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS vary their system according to vulnerability    not-vul  1@C=forcing and 1@D=1+   vul = 2/1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @d by north (-helps to make decisions -is best ) but practicly you cant get that slam to norths hand|pg||
nt|geot: 2NT some sort of super accept|pg||
nt|geot: A good all 1-3 limit bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sunsamvar: that is angrily agreed :)|pg||

nt|murat e: searching for a slam....|pg||
nt|baldfriede: they apparently don't use Bergen raises|pg||
nt|geot: Hard to stop lower, but it looks like one down to me|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence after this lead is another diamond|pg||
nt|baldfriede: if N continues @d it will be down|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|snorre: :) possible|pg||
nt|snorre: not anymore   :)|pg||
nt|andersk: Good res for Denmark here!|pg||

nt|baldfriede: the age-old discussion whether to open 1n or 1 of a major with 5 majors|pg||

nt|stc: must guess @h probably|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he can be disappointed immediately|pg||
nt|jbgood: on   15 EW OR saved in 5 @h and went for 300 only - so a swing for Nor|pg||
pc|s5|nt|baldfriede: understandable; I would be searching for it too with the hand of S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: no - he has a good hand|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|po-s: that is for girls - the boys prefer beers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of many links for Beer Card   http://www.pagat.com/boston/bridge.html beer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more amusing   http://www.nswba.com.au/youth/ybeer.html|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table is now 1/2 trick behind this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Allavena in 4@S on same lead/discard|pg||
nt|po-s: predictions please! Make or no make|pg||
nt|baldjean: make|pg||
nt|stc: make|pg||
nt|bobholl: Make 90%|pg||
nt|geot: Tough bidding by North, but to be fair, if S has not so much in clubs it could easily be a slam|pg||
nt|snorre: pass an option i MP's, but not in IMPS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: The diamond lead was maybe natural, but the spade K would have been the winner, most likely for 2 down|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|sunsamvar: anyone for 2@H instead of dbl with the west hand?|pg||
nt|baldjean: Elinscu will switch to a red suit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  now west had better @c =double KJ974 -last hand where he had KJ732 -he missed the double now he didn't want to miss chance|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|po-s: I don´t think so|pg||
nt|baldjean: Now however...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at trick 2  Allavena guessed @H correctly|pg||
nt|bobholl: down 80% |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @h9 at other table, but i don't see that affecting the guess from dummy|pg||
nt|murat e: if dia finesse was on as heart finesse already good.....|pg||
nt|geot: Now the contract will make|pg||
nt|baldfriede: now N/S have shot their powder|pg||
nt|jbgood: agree|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: @s ruayý çekmeli|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C X strongly suggests they'll end up in @H|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|psyck: dbl for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Turbo   so 5@C probably an odd number of keycards|pg||
nt|snorre: will he win this one, friends?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes|pg||
nt|snorre: few loosers, but few tricks too...   :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, but toiling and sweating|pg||

pc|cK|nt|stc: DAX is down....|pg||
nt|geot: N/S will "survive" in 5@H if he takes the trump finesse which is the percentage play with ten trumps|pg||
nt|jbgood: club finesse now makes 9 tricks easy|pg||

nt|baldjean: @h was more for a last ditch attempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S did make in the other room|pg||

nt|snorre: 1....|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an|16+|nt|snorre: If east wanted to play for clubs 3-3, he should have tried that earlier, when he still had spades left...|pg||
nt|pelu:  then he risk 2 @D-ruffs agains him - and the discard of @d7 indicate 5-1 - so correct to play @h first|pg||
nt|snorre: playing same board both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: if clubs 4-2, he could return to 1h's|pg||
nt|runnerup:  restricted choice 4 @s --but can you make and bid|pg||

nt|murat e: on board 16 where romanian south decided to pass one spade nexr room made 7 hearts........|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Ahora se cargan los resultados nuevamente.|pg||
nt|stc: not for Encho :(|pg||
nt|geot: This can end in 7@H which is a v good contract|pg||
nt|baldfriede: if they find the grand here it should be a good start for winning by 29 IMPs|pg||
nt|snorre: norwegians stopped in 5@h. Maybe a win for Norway here?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: is this real or are they joking again|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: seems that Entscho forgot the System...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: it has to be played carefully though|pg||
nt|geot: Even 7NT has chances on a double squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 12 top tricks, North must keep diamonds, South must keep spades. Who can keep clubs?|pg||
nt|geot: A club lead might disturb it though.....|pg||
nt|baldfriede: declarer can ruff 2@s before leading trumps to set up the 13th trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: last and only time Norway won the Bonn Nations cup was in 1999. About time to repeat that - but not a strong start. Poland has won 6 times|pg||

nt|geot: Red ag Green pass is fine|pg||
nt|murat e: bid 4 of course.....|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  2@d was "Michaels", both majors over the possibly short club|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d looks like Ghestem|pg||

mb|3H|nt|psyck: yes|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tx Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: K@c wrong-sided for the slam|pg||
nt|snorre: need Kx onside?|pg||
nt|jbgood: playing the club suit for no loser does not give the best of odds|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: so this should be 13 imps back for Norway|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @H2 = Slawinsky Leads   a) even without honor  b) odd with honor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/ forster/bridge/development/slawinski/|pg||
nt|runnerup:  more votes for 3 @s in north hand now |pg||
nt|jbgood: I wont argue - but looks impossible as play is recorded...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stc: there is no medicine for this contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: not only on vugraph i once played them 2 strange happenings|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: Elinescu is very unhappy about this 4@s... No wonder|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|stc: he-he, he has to play it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Frey declaring a boring 2@D North|pg||
nt|stc: yes, a large win for Monaco|pg||
nt|bobholl: they are lucky it is NV|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, only 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|snorre: always a good feeling to start with the teo first tricks in opp slams...   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorre: two|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  4@c over the double showed a game acceptance|pg||
nt|psyck: it is common to use 2@d instead of 2@c in modified Ghestem variations|pg||
nt|geot: A light overcall would have propelled them to a tough but playable game, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: east showed 6@H, 4@S and a club shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: running scores: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/BNC-2012/12_05_16_team.html|pg||
nt|geot: In 7@H no double squeeze needed|pg||
nt|baldfriede: so the grand has been found. now it has to be made|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sunsamvar: E treating it as strong Micheals i suppose|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|snorre: Hoffa wins 10 tricks there...   I bet a dollar :)|pg||
nt|geot: He dont know who of the opps eventually is short in spades. South might ruff over .....|pg||
nt|geot: He can ruff with the jack, but then he may go down if trumps are 4-1|pg||
nt|geot: etc etc...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: it is not too strong, but @c void is good & pd showed game interest, & its a vul game|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now what is best line|pg||
nt|henryb:  I don't think he was until partner showed interest and North showed strong clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: oops|pg||
nt|geot: so to play it is tough, much more comfortable for us seeing all the cards:)|pg||
nt|snorre: 13 IMP to Norway|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d8|nt|henryb:  We should have thought about that earlier|pg||
nt|stc: do EW know about the misunderstanding ?|pg||

nt|henryb:  what the best line is|pg||
nt|baldjean: lol|pg||
nt|baldfriede: indeed|pg||
