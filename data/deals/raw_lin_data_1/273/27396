nt|DaMan: Hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|an|forcing|nt|DaMan: the Vanderbilt Trophy has been in competition since 1928|pg||
mb|p|nt|DaMan: via a Knockout Teams formula|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  This looks to be two down|pg||
nt|Henryb:  2@h was either a weak preference to 2@s or any strongish hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|DaMan: T%he comptition has benn narrowed from 69 teams to the 4 teams now in play|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|DaMan: yes    looks like weakish    3C was a further game try    accepted of course|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|nt|Henryb:  Well, 68 anyway, as one team entered and immediately withdrew|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|DaMan: right   right|pg||
nt|DaMan: I was remembering the initial roster|pg||
nt|Henryb:  4@s is not the worst contract ever, but it needs trumps breaking, and to hold the pointed losers to 2|pg||
nt|DaMan: For the record    Michael Rosenberg is a deliberate and thoughtful player.....therefore he will take his time in every case|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: his tanks are legendary|pg||
nt|DaMan: I didn't say that|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Michael is not on the list of the slowest players in the world. Not even a contender|pg||
nt|DaMan: Bauke Muller and Andrew Robson have him beat hands down|pg||
nt|Henryb:  plus we have frequent network issues from St louis|pg||
