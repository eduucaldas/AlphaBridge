mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  overboard    but down 3 seems a lot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: With all those quacks, I think 2@S is enough|pg||
nt|tias:  2@s = 8-10 3S kept the Norwegians where they should be|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: sizable swing for Argentina here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not worth a 2/1 response followed by an invite|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|tias:  at the other table Peter Jepsen had to bid 2C (forcing 1) and then jump to 3@s showing 10-12 3@s|pg||
nt|tias:  and first swing of this match|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Queen and jacks are grossly overrated in the 4321 scale|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aces underrated|pg||
nt|pelu:  if u bid 2@C over 1@S then only 2@s next time - I dont expect that they play 2-0-1 GF in CR|pg||
nt|tias:  at least playing a suit contract they are|pg||
nt|tias:  but Majka Bilde has learned (at home) that you DONT miss a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|ady: as much as 9 or 10 imps|pg||
nt|tias:  (north at the other table)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner can't bid over a 2@S raise, you are unlikely to have missed a game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 2@C followed by 2@S if you wish|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|tias:  i dont agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Given that 2@C is just a one-round force|pg||
nt|tias:  if you have support you show support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 2@S not support?|pg||
nt|pelu:  so Mathias NS in Cr are forced to bid this 4@s??|pg||
nt|tias:  2S would be a nonforcing preference for spades with at most 2@s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tias:  im not saying they couldnt have avoided this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  2@S  the hand is not worth 10 hcp|pg||
nt|pelu:  but how, Mathias?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because of the loose queens and jack|pg||

nt|Dagold: not sure what 2@d is, it may simply be a multi or perhaps it shows some kind of two-suiter|pg||
nt|Dagold: leaves Bilde with a diffficult bid|pg||
