mb|2D|nt|sybarra: sorry that answer to requestion for teams |pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: Also, the top Dutch Open players (excepet perhaps Marion Michielsen) often make wild bids themselves, so perhaps their role models contribute too  |pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bebechira: nice opening by south :)|pg||

nt|petergill: West with 15 HCP is the only Passer, so far|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|petergill: If West simply bids 3NT over 2@D, the club lead is very hard to find|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|petergill: There actually is a case for South, at the fav vul, to bid 3@C over 2@D, to allow for good saves (if EW reach 4@H or 3NT)|pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and that is their limit  (E/W) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|sybarra: in fact likely -1 |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: West has bid technically to the right spot, but the practical 3NT bid over 2@D was an almost certain winner (with N likely to lead a major suit)|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: N has tough lead problem if South passes|pg||
