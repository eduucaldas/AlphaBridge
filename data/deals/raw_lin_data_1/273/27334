mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|nt|kareno: A typical partscore battle - who wins the partscores normally wins the long matches in my long experience.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|jbgood: 3 NT might make on this one, impossible to get there it seems|pg||

nt|swanson:  Unless North bids 3D!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Excellent 3@d bid I would say.  Don't think they can even think of 3nt now.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they are discussing the meaning of the double -- mostly TO, as we can see|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kareno: Reverse the heart J and T and a heart shift would be needed at once to defeat 3@d.|pg||
nt|swanson:  Seems a strange 3D to me.  I don't see how he would be expecting to make the contract.|pg||
nt|kareno: But I don't think he relished defending 3@c doubled|pg||
nt|jbgood: well, he didnt have much defense against 3 @c either...|pg||

mb|p|nt|swanson:  This auction gives EW lots of room to explore games and slams.  They might avoid a losing game here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and a chance to stop in 1NT instead of 2NT on some hands|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ady: looks like they may get overboard|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: not without play for 3NT on a good day|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: wow this is high :)|pg||
nt|swanson:  The West hand is better than the high card count by quite a bit, but 2NT initially is self-preemptive without being particulaily descriptive.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1NT = 18-19;  2@C was supposed to be a puppet to 2@d|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|swanson:  East's 2@C was a relay to 2D, but West felt he needed to bid more.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: west 1NT in theory denied 4 spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: well if you play 2@C as transfer to 2@D or invite you only can bid 2@S with max and 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: notrump seems better as a contract but east is not unhappy to play a Moysian fit.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually it is west, Rigal, declaring|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: south's card was suit pref (in theory)|pg||

nt|swanson:  At least declarer will be relieved here that 3NT wasn't going to make either.|pg||

nt|kareno: Duboin classically defending by refusing to overruff with trump length|pg||

nt|swanson:  not playing|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: He would like to see declarer now play ace and another spade |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Duboin confirms that W showed 18-19|pg||

nt|swanson:  I would make a tqkeout double with the East cards.  Overcalling 1@H acts as a preempt against  your own 4-card spade holding.|pg||
