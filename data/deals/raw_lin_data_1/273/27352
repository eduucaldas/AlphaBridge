nt|ritong: would a 2@c opening be crazy?|pg||

nt|ritong: wang is in a quandary|pg||
nt|ritong: clearly 5@s will not cost the building|pg||
nt|ritong: when his pard obv has @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: but if he bids now, he will have to bid 6@s as well imo|pg||
nt|ritong: if opponents take one more|pg||
nt|agumperz:  he should expect approximately -1 in 5@S but he does he want to disturb their game when they might be laydown for vul slam?|pg||
nt|ritong: he has a typical hand with which sacrifice at 6 level costs less than game bonus, though|pg||
nt|agumperz:  true|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - he has good enough prospects for two tricks|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|ritong: but he drops it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|agumperz:  Bob Todd is disappointed right now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: a 15 imps swing|pg||
nt|agumperz:  he will cheer up soon|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|mc|11|nt|ritong: when do we restart operator please?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  th th th that's all folks!|pg||
nt|ritong: 11 minutes i m told|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous  see you all soon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 15 minutes would be my guess|pg||
nt|agumperz:  29 IMPS is not insurmountable|pg||
nt|ritong: by far and large|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: closing, will back soon.|pg||

nt|dburn: and the queen of diamonds|pg||
mb|1H|nt|agumperz:  right|pg||
nt|gracelin: Huang continues the way they beat  3 Diamond yesterday.  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|gracelin: a Good 6D for EW but the unexpected trump loser will hold it to 5D only|pg||
nt|dburn: another unquiet deal|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see if they continue to walk on water|pg||
nt|gracelin: they survived even on very thin ice|pg||
nt|dburn: would expect Fu just to bid 4@h, expecting 4@s, then 5@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: East can choose from 2S, 4H and 3D|pg||
nt|agumperz:  6@D looks like a fine contract, but it is sunk by the 3-0 diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h with three cards is awkward|pg||
nt|dburn: but at these colors he may bid diamonds first|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gracelin: Fu know south is going tobid 4S after his bid, so must form a strategy to cope that|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 4NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: now EW will play in D|pg||
nt|agumperz:  Thats an excellent piece of general advice patrick|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: anticipation, baby|pg||
mb|d|nt|agumperz:  when you are very short in enemy suit, and you know they will raise on your left, plan for it and choose a bid now that helps partner|pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the last of sehment 3 and there are 16 more boards to go.  Winner of this match will advance to top 8 and meet Prooijen tean.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, he can't now be sure what to do|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: ah|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: thin ice has a small failure, seems|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: must be an misunderatsing on the meaning of double.  Don't believe West doubled for penalty with his good D fit.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  down 1 if they get a ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: and while I normally agree with everything Andrew says, you probably ought not to bid the East hand without ever supporting hearts|pg||
nt|agumperz:  it would be very unlucky if EW bid 6@D at the other table tho...|pg||
nt|ritong: you crow!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|gracelin: West could duck a round to see pd signal, or he may take SA and underlead H to hope for Q10x in H for 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gracelin: East needs to give a signal to show HQ, by now he knows West has both HA, K for his opening|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|gracelin: he duly did that with an encouraging H3|pg||
pc|s7|mc|10|nt|ritong: ..?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  hmmm|pg||
nt|gracelin: DJ¾D¦Y§g?|pg||
nt|ritong: confirmed result, operator?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: making 4|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ty|pg||
nt|agumperz:  that is a sorely needed swing|pg||
nt|gracelin: Still looks impossible to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Fu was mad!|pg||
nt|ritong: surely so|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous  great fun as always with you guys|pg||
nt|agumperz:  In London, they are saying Jie was mad.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and Fu was angry|pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks all and see you later|pg||
nt|dburn: come back tomorrow, we'll do it all again|pg||
nt|ritong: deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: lol...break time!|pg||
nt|agumperz:  thx everyone!|pg||
nt|agumperz:  bye now|pg||
nt|dburn: but another sixteen here - good luck to the Canadians, on whichever team|pg||
