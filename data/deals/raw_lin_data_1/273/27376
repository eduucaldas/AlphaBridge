nt|Chick: OK, too many private conversations, but the general opinion is that it cannot be made if Fredin continues a heart after winning the @SK|pg||
nt|Chick: Very interesting problem ... if you knew the @SK was off, could you make it then?|pg||
nt|Chick: perhaps with a heart endplay of S|pg||
nt|Chick: but in that case, must not take the spade finesse |pg||
nt|Chick: so double dummy it can be made|pg||

nt|Chick: lots are telling me that GIB says it can be made .... I"m not suppose to look at GIB, but I'll take your word for it|pg||
nt|Chick: I agree with several who say he will try clubs to see if J10 drop, and when not, he will try the spade finesse|pg||
nt|Chick: We all seem to agree that (1) a spade finesse, heart continuation kills the squeeze, and (2) finessing the @H9 and endplaying S in hearts does work|pg||
