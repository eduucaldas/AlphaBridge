mb|6C|an|alert|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: North's only worry is the spade suit now|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but if S has 2 he can probably ruff enough|pg||

nt|kuky2: this is the big problem|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if he draws a 2nd round of trumps|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: he sees East has only 1, singelton @s less likely|pg||
nt|kuky2: this is the best choise|pg||
nt|kuky2: what about E having 4 @s|pg||
nt|kuky2: ?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: that could well be the case|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but then West might have many clubs, a 3@c opener?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
