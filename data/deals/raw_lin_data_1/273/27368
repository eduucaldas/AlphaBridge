mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tias:  They play a natural 15-17nt, 1@h can be 4-4 majors otherwise 5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tias:  weak twos and attitude leads|pg||
nt|tias:  EW we have the Swedish French constellation Peter Bertheau (sweden) and Thomas Bessis (france)|pg||
nt|tias:  i dont know their methods, but i would guess for a natural base with a lot of small gadgets|pg||
nt|tias:  swedish standard is transfer @c with multi opening and 10-13 6card suit in 2major|pg||
nt|tias:  french is even more natural with 2C and 2D strong, better minor and no transfers|pg||
nt|tias:  time will show what they have agreed on :)|pg||
