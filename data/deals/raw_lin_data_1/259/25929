nt|cc469: Hi Peter et al|pg||
nt|petergill: All 4 players in the Kalmin team are immigrants from South Africa to Sydney|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|petergill: Kalmin has 9 VP carry-forward|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|petergill: Both these partnerships do not have much partnership experience|pg||
nt|mcleish:  Cormack and McLeish had their last hitout in Venice 84 playing for NZ|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cc469: pretty straightforward first board - an easy one to start |pg||
nt|petergill: EW play Standard|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@D Splinter|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|petergill: 6@S appears to have only 1 loser but has a limited number of winners|pg||
mb|5S|nt|petergill: Spade lead is best, to prevent cross ruff|pg||
nt|cc469: maybe not such an easy one to start|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think Paula McLeish will lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: she'd better:)|pg||
nt|petergill: which will make West's task very difficult|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cc469: seems a sensible lead - leading away from any Q could be giving a trick away|pg||
nt|petergill: Slams without long (5+ card) side suits often need 9 card fits instead of this 8 card fit to make, otherwise issues of lack of trumps occur|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cc469: now can come to 12 tricks I think|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|s5|pc|d6|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: what version allows picking best 5 of 13|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @D = multi,  and W is sure that the suit is NOT spades |pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: usually 8 card suits are called TRUMPS |pg||
nt|fabsayc: south needs to bid 3h|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me 4 @H makes |pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|petergill: I think EW play 2@H 8-11, with 2@D Multi for 0-7 weak twos|pg||
nt|cc469: raise p or show your 8 card suit?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: Any 8 card major suit is biddable|pg||
nt|cc469: yes, especiallt the black one|pg||
nt|cc469: especially|pg||
nt|petergill: Of Jan Cormack's mass of queens and jacks, only @DJ and @CQ are useful cards, but 5@C is on|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cc469: hard to get there|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h4|nt|cc469: only looking at EW hands Peter, wher would you want to be?|pg||
nt|petergill: I like 4@c on Jan's cards, raised to 5@C by North. From North's point of view, 3@C might have been a 3 card suit.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: Not sure, Carl. |pg||
nt|cc469: spades needs trumps 2-2 but 4@H seems easier to beat|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: 4@S might fail with trumps 2-2 and @H 3-1. I think on the EW cards I would like to be in any contract except defending 5@C|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@H - 4@H might produce 4NT by N, leading to 5@C by South, so Avril's 2@s bid turned out OK|pg||

nt|cc469: I will pay off to the pair that gets to 4@S|pg||

nt|sybarra: that is usually why some of us would open S hand with 1 @D |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|timb: Not me; I never open the bidding on a 4-card diamond suit when I have a 5-card club suit|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|petergill: If North plays @D7 as upside down count instead of @D4, it would be easier for S to tell that W did not have 4 @d's|pg||

pc|c4|nt|mwigor: can be made|pg||
nt|mwigor: but declarer needs to play kalmin for Kx in @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was going to say, and can go down |pg||

nt|sybarra: might make it now,  cashing aq of hts |pg||
nt|mwigor: nothing else looks like it can work|pg||

nt|cc469: even if it could be set up|pg||
nt|petergill: Best was to win @HA then play a red suit immediately from dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|petergill: but the NS bidding made West think that North had an entry|pg||
mb|d|nt|cc469: I meant of course negative double not penalty double ... my computer sometimes has a mind of its own|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: Hard hand to play, but the actual line gave West little chance of 9 tricks ... always try to find a play to make your contract? |pg||

nt|petergill: or two ago on BBO is great. |pg||
nt|cc469: but still needs @H finesse even with @Ds set up :)|pg||
nt|petergill: West could have made all sorts of lower slam tries over 2@S if she wanted to - all would be rejected and EW would stop in 4@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: thanks all, restart at 11.30|pg||
nt|cc469: congratulations Lauren - a nice result:)|pg||
