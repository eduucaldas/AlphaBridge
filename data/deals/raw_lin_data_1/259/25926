pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kirp:  must admit ducking the @c should be obvious when declarer immediately goes after the suit you lead, or is he being tricky!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf:  south's thought may well be to no avail|pg||
nt|kirp:  this defense died at trick 2|pg||
nt|dburn: probably needs to find partner with @sAJ10|pg||
nt|dburn: since South will know where all the high cards are by now|pg||
nt|roswolf:  yes but unlikely on the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: not very - West has not shown spade values particularly|pg||
nt|roswolf:  but east has|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but South can see what East has in spades|pg||
nt|dburn: since they are on the table|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf:  2nt also indicates values|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kirp:  neither N or S wanted the lead sooo....|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but West would bid 2NT with @sQx just as easily as @sQ10|pg||
nt|dburn: still, a heart shift was possible, because of lack of communications|pg||

nt|kirp:  2@c for both majors|pg||
nt|kirp:  and not forc|pg||
nt|dburn: cue shows either a game force or limited with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|dburn: but North may feel that he still owes partner something|pg||
nt|roswolf:  north has distorted - typical of the twins|pg||
nt|dburn: not a complete distortion - 1NT certainly possible, though|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  i would have bid 1nt|pg||
nt|kirp:  dble from me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|roswolf:  this is uncomfortable|pg||
nt|dburn: partner is a passed hand, so more risk that 1NT will go for lots|pg||
nt|kirp:  2N seems pushy, if 2H was limited|pg||
nt|dburn: even so, if you're going to have this sequence after doubling, you should probably start with 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf:  agreed david|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what about bidding ONLY 1@S with south hand -- hoping for 2nd chance to show @H?   maybe the cue with only 7HCP needed values in the majors rather than short suits|pg||
nt|kirp:  think N should have passed 2 H, needed a full near opening to move on|pg||

nt|roswolf:  yup|pg||
nt|kirp:  defense has only 5 easy trix, but declare also has only 7 whichever red suit he plays|pg||
