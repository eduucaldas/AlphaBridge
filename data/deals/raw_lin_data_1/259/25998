mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|2D!|an|Single Major|nt|idc:  So no scores from those 3 boards until the end but 19 & 20 look poor for N-S (Ewart)|pg||

nt|roswolf:  on this layout there is no defence|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|idc:  In fact, sometimes he can throw West in with 5th round of @d to lead clubs for him, not even needing @c finesse|pg||

nt|andyv:  most play 2@h or 2@s in 4th seat as an opener with 6 in the suit....some play it that the hand is about a K better than an opener|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost no one plays it as weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Andy |pg||
nt|sybarra: no reason for a "real" preempt in that seat |pg||

nt|gsper:  Reserving 2@D for bad or good hands|pg||
nt|andyv:  I can't find a card for EW but Hallberg with his regular partner in the past (John Holland) play 4 card majors, 15-17NT and 2/1 is one round force.|pg||
