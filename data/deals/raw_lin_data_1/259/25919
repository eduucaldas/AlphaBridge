mb|p|mb|3C!|an|checkback for 3 card support|nt|pdjourdain:  Checkback|pg||
nt|athene: which is better here, 6@H or 6NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ady: nice 6@H   or 6NT     needs hearts not JXXX with north and split spade honours|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|"4/5 in majors"|nt|athene: you *might* make 6nt sometimes with a heart loser, but not often, i guess|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  If North held @HJxxx you might make 6@H by ruffing the fourth spade|pg||
nt|athene: wouldn't you lose a spade and a heart?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Cancel that|pg||
nt|athene: but in 6nt you might bring in 3 spade tricks and then get 3 diamonds on a squeeze or something|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|an|alerted...?|nt|ady: 6NT  better    can make against 5 hearts with south   and has some chance with long hearts with north|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Yes, I prefer 6NT slightly|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: people tend to lock into 8-card major fits of course|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: meantime Hinden have slippped up here|pg||

nt|ady: south may take action|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ady: will north pass|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess south's hand is a lot better with a fit|pg||
nt|athene: little does he know, 3@H didn't show a fit :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  i suppose this is makeable, but it's a pretty revolting game|pg||
nt|ady: j10 hearts stiff  means 2 losing herarts and sspade goes on A@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  plus a very lucky lie in clubs, if you can do it all|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: to bring in this club suit for one loser you have to find someone with Ax and lead through him then duck one|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  This might make losing just a club and two trumps|pg||
nt|athene: clearly on the bidding east is the prime candidate for that|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Declarer is really forced into playing East for @CAx in hearts|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  not to worry, only 18 imps|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is an interesting little sequence|pg||
nt|jbgood: imo S's hand has too much potential to exclude black contracts|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed jon|pg||
nt|roswolf: now we will see|pg||
nt|roswolf: east's opening is 2+@C|pg||
nt|jbgood: it has to be natural - the 1 club opening just said "I have an opener"|pg||
nt|roswolf: in england that is not a universal view|pg||

nt|athene: but if you start with 2@C, and opps bid spades, it could get hard to introduce the heart suit|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  Hi David|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  4-card major, strong NT, so this shows weak notrump|pg||
