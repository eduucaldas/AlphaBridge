mb|p|mb|1D|nt|cc469: I give blame to E - she knew @S lead was singleton|pg||

nt|frankaus: -50 at other table so this may not get punished on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@S would probably have failed by a trick (on a @D ruff) at the other table, but Paula McLeish's reasonable decsion to bid 6@C over 5@S is not the cause of the loss of imps|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor: 2NT looks normal enough - how else will you get to 3NT when its right?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cc469: or conversly, how to stay out of 3NT when it has no play|pg||
nt|mwigor: if it has no play partner will not raise|pg||
nt|cc469: 2NT with no stopper in either major? not for me|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|petergill: Put me with Carl. Dbl of 2@D might slowly reach 3NT from the right side. Michael might bid 2NT because the right side is often played by him. My Dbl would lead to me being dummy ...|pg||
nt|petergill: more often |pg||
