pc|c5|pc|h4|nt|petergill: I'm not sure if Terry Brown will play the last set with Bruce Neill or with Paul Wyer. They have a team fo five. |pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: anyone know which match we will get for the last set?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: think we will probably get seniors|pg||
nt|mwigor: wyer needs to play the last set to remain eligible for everything|pg||
nt|mwigor: but they may not care|pg||
nt|petergill: yes, the closer match (just)|pg||
nt|petergill: In both matches, the lower ranked team (acccording to the original seeding) has a small lead |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: We'll be vugraphing seniors. Unless loads of people want to see womens|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Lauren Travis our operator (from her unbiased uncle), and to Sydney expert Michael Wilkinson |pg||

nt|petergill: The Kalmin team certainly are a team who have a go in the bidding (i.e. they bid 'em up)_|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: anyone who wants to keep watching seniors please say so!|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: no bring back the ladies please @H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: wow I did not expect this|pg||
nt|petergill: It's only a few votes from the specs, and it's up to the organizers. These Seniors play very good bridge indeed, but specs seem to prefer more drama. |pg||
nt|petergill: First vote in for the Seniors has just arrived|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: and put a microphone on Jan so we can get her comments :)|pg||
nt|petergill: another vote for the Seniors|pg||
nt|petergill: and an operator who prefers the Seniors|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder if showing the Open Room of each match is possible?|pg||
nt|petergill: I can always put Mat McManus's scoresheet up regularly so you can see what the other table is doing, and the operator can type that in. |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: unfortunately we can't do both, and theboss has said we have to do seniors|pg||
