nt|zebutin: at the earlier time (1930-ish) you could open 1nt if you have right amount of points, at most 4-4-3-2 distribution (no 5 card minors even) and had something in every suit|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|zebutin: if not, it was idea that some suit bid would tell your hand type better|pg||
nt|zebutin: but as the ears rolled by it got more common to bid with 5 card minor in 1nt|pg||
nt|zebutin: not every suit stopped|pg||
nt|zebutin: and nowadays you might get sometimes 6 card minors or 5card majors in notrump. 5-4 distributions&etc, it might be the most stretched bid there is.|pg||
