mb|p|nt|riccho:  14-16 IÂ´m told|pg||
nt|athene: one thing i have noticed with slam auctions is that whenever one player has a long solid suit, if his partner is "captain" of the auction, good 6 or 7 often gets missed|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: because if you have small singleton or doubleton in partner's suit you are always worried about a loser there|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Doubt-showing redouble at the 7-level, great stuff|pg||
nt|athene: south maybe thinking that if west has a void in diamonds, the diamonds might not run, so 7@D or 7NT is down too, but i don't see you have much to lose|pg||
