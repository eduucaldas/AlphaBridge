mb|p|mb|3C|nt|eweber: hi everyone, welcome back to the 2nd half of this final|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: 2@d presumably a Multi, or maybe just a weak two|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|eweber: what a hand to start with!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, West will enquire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's obvious now that East has hearts - it's the only suit he hasn't bid|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: told 3@c maximum, 3@s=hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|psyck:  They bid that way to right side |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  could well go overboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think soemone had better bid hearts soon|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|eweber: at the other table East has jumped to 4@c over an art. 1@c opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|psyck:  wonder if 4@s was kickback|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: welcome to Ugins Jansons :)|pg||
nt|ady: slam  can be played 2 ways   ruffing finesse of KQ@C    or  a squeeze on south if south has A@C   and Q@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it, 4NT=1 key|pg||
nt|psyck:  if so W knows two key cards missing|pg||
nt|ady: neither works|pg||
mb|6H|nt|eweber: ending up with North bidding and playing 4@h |pg||
nt|ady: ruffing finesse best odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: Ugis|pg||
nt|ugis: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  E got tempted by the void|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: well done NS - they have reached a top spot on this deal|pg||

pc|c2|nt|bg: GM all good save in 5 clubs 4 hearts max for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the good thing for NS here is that North is on lead, so South won't be tempted to lead a fatal ace|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kerasidis: :) good to have nice company:)|pg||
nt|ady: possible slam in hearts again     again fails|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  I all|pg||
mb|3C|nt|penseur9:  Sorry for the delay|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a thin responsive double, but reasonable with four hearts |pg||
mb|3S|nt|penseur9:  Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Andre|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Hope everyone knows we have voice commentary as well, just press the play button next to each name in the bottom right corner |pg||
nt|penseur9:  Hi Oosmarb|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But you need to use the web client through  www.bridgebase.com  to get voice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: against the odds slam   around 37 percent|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is rather familiar|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: maximum and hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: good pass by N 2 H about limit with this distribution|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  This seems easy enough with @D breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  The system we think N-S play, more or less|pg||
nt|psyck:  this time they mey decide staying out with 2 key cards missing is a good idea after all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: they should locate 2 key cards missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: so Monaco has striked back - good news for the spectators (sorry Luxembourg :))|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia in the other semi has extended the lead and thus look strong contenders for the final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: identical bidding so far!|pg||
nt|psyck:  they are checking the back of the cards|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: well, if the defence switches to diamonds declarer may get locked in hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Actually dummy is blocked!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but that is not exactly easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still if there is one West who could find that defence, it is this one |pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Will probably be able to use defenders as stepping stone|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: however, East has no keys, so we should not see 4NT|pg||
nt|psyck:  5@c 03 this time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West knows two keys are missing now|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mdgraham: although it has to be the @DJ, otherwise the @D9 is a dummy entry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: gosh, this is complex|pg||
nt|penseur9:  very|pg||
nt|penseur9:  @S seems the best hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dont seems to want to use rkc so they can avoid getting too high   though of course some days 6@H will make|pg||
nt|psyck:  W praying this wont be raised|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ugis: looks like -1 here and a push|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is more efficient, if hearts are trumps, to use 4@s as the keycard ask rather than 4NT|pg||
nt|ady: now praying K@H wrong|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|ady: apparnetly 4@S was their rkc on this sequence|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|ugis: sorry 3 imps to Lux|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kerasidis: there is always a question about thiese hands ...whether to rebid a 4 card suit or the 6 card|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, declarer could hardly have Axx of clubs|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pelu: but it has been 10 hards days for the young players|pg||
mb|3C|an|fit 3Â° limite|nt|marlowepi: pretty strong for Multi, even at these colors, but as i mentioned earlier, the national tendency in france is to be solid|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of play - and prob some party'es :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I would also open 2@D :):)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: even within the context of French standards, 2D is marginal I think because of the playability in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: obviously a style thing|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: here all roads lead to 4S, though the D lead would probably be somewhat harder to read had the opening bid been 1H|pg||
nt|pelu: to day - spec in Europe - a lot of playeres know very well how to defend against Multi, so there are "many" who play Multi a little more contructiv that before |pg||
nt|marlowepi: here declarer can afford to suffer a ruff and it might well simplify the play for him by drawing a half-round of trumps:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: I'm told West returned a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: NS is playing a variable club system (Swedish style), 1@d shows 11-15 unbal with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c=FG with clubs or balanced or heart support|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ugis: auction in open room was simple 1-2-4|pg||
nt|bg: non vul with N hand should be preempting  and now S will not allow EW to play a vul game|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|kerasidis: what 3@c meant?|pg||

nt|penseur9:  3@C I meant|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: typical Bergen would be 7-9, but the shape is good |pg||
nt|psyck:  3H = 5+H GF, 1-suiter or 4S-5H (was 4522 12, 2812 13, 3532 16)|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@d was no major|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if West bid bid 4@c, and it was passed out, then one can safely say that a misunderstanding has occurred  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot of players use Smolen here - not NS, obviously|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eweber: anyone here who knows the EW system?|pg||
nt|eweber: well, I learned that they play a strong club sys, but for the XX we can only assume that it might show a half stopper|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: Smolen would be 3@s by South to show 4@S5@h |pg||
nt|psyck:  4@d cue with fit|pg||
nt|ady: south might be worried about a club ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently they use Reverse Smolen, as they play weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: however on the lay will not have much difficulty  which ever line taken|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kerasidis: i would not pass east's hand |pg||
