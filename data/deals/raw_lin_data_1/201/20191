nt|roswolf: now this is trappy|pg||
nt|steshome:  I think the line was not right, but playing the ace at trick one wasn't the issue|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe - but i like taking finesses especially when they are 95% to win|pg||
nt|steshome:  It was always about trump control|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C!|an|diamonds|nt|roswolf: i dont like the double by north too many soft values and little shape|pg||
