pc|dT|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|penseur9: 3@D looks like a Bergen raise|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eweber: what a hand to start with!|pg||
nt|rv: E-W should score this comfortably, @c strain might have fetched 10 tricks though|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  predictable contract   but wont make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, West will enquire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's obvious now that East has hearts - it's the only suit he hasn't bid|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@c maximum, 3@s=hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: yes , reverse, 3@c would be the limit raise|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: E-W should compete to 3@c here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck:  They bid that way to right side |pg||
nt|psyck:  good lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  Hi Andy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck:  could well go overboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think soemone had better bid hearts soon|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence seems to have five tricks in clear view - two spades, two diamonds and a club |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as usual, when you lead fro KQ10, dummy has the jack and declarer the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, I was going to try my first voice, but somehow I don't seem to be accepted|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: Guisy, is Allegra a full 6 member team with Sementa and Duboin 3rd pair sitting out this segment?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eweber: at the other table East has jumped to 4@c over an art. 1@c opening|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|psyck:  wonder if 4@s was kickback|pg||
nt|ady: looks to to be only 7 tricks   2 diamonds   3 hearts 1 club  and 1 further black suit trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like two spades, a club and a diamond to lose at first sight|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Krishna|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  tricky defence required to beat this?|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, @d switch needed|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can count up to 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|psyck:  & @h will be entry to cash @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bill|pg||
pc|c3|nt|queequeg: welcome to Ugins Jansons :)|pg||
nt|ady: slam  can be played 2 ways   ruffing finesse of KQ@C    or  a squeeze on south if south has A@C   and Q@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it, 4NT=1 key|pg||
nt|psyck:  if so W knows two key cards missing|pg||
nt|ady: neither works|pg||
nt|psyck:  Running Scores: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eweber: ending up with North bidding and playing 4@h |pg||
nt|ady: ruffing finesse best odds|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|queequeg: Ugis|pg||
nt|ugis: hello everyone|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|psyck:  E got tempted by the void|pg||
nt|psyck:  def has easy road to 5 tricks now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ugis: well done NS - they have reached a top spot on this deal|pg||
nt|psyck:  more or less needs @cA right|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  West has to duck this ... then the switch|pg||
nt|andyv:  K@h overtake Q@s and play 10@h|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d was 3 card 10-11 or 4 card 7-11 as per above CC|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bg: GM all good save in 5 clubs 4 hearts max for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the good thing for NS here is that North is on lead, so South won't be tempted to lead a fatal ace|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: I am told yes to my earlier question of 3rd pair by knowledgable specs|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Wayne Stuart|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi everyone.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: 9@C   Lauria duck|pg||
nt|psyck:  we still have lesser specs here than other room, the kibs are pampered by getting to watch Papi daily on BBO anyway|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: now should cash out for down 2|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||

nt|andyv:  cash out time for down 1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psyck:  * or some squeeze|pg||
nt|psyck: other room did not take the @h double fin & made 4@h|pg||

mb|1H|nt|penseur9:  Sorry for the delay|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  cheap contract|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: clubs play for 6 winners so defence dont get therir spade trick   also diamonds 3-2|pg||
nt|penseur9: I expected them tobe in NT|pg||
nt|psyck:  some would bid 1N as E at this vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a thin responsive double, but reasonable with four hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: VAL DI MAGRA Team: CAITI Stefano - COLOTTO Giuseppe - LANZAROTTI Massimo - MANNO Andrea - PATANE' Rosario - PATTACINI Maurizio - POCHINI Claudio - ZAFFINO Maurizio|pg||
nt|rv: Pattacini unlikely to find @DA lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: ALLEGRA Team: BOCCHI Norberto - DUBOIN Giorgio - GIUBILO Valerio - LAURIA Lorenzo - MADALA Agustin - SEMENTA Antonio - VERSACE Alfredo - ZALESKI Roman|pg||
nt|rv: ty Guisy|pg||
nt|psyck:  but a poor idea when both opps are passed|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c game forcing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|penseur9:  Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Andre|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Hope everyone knows we have voice commentary as well, just press the play button next to each name in the bottom right corner |pg||
nt|penseur9:  Hi Oosmarb|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But you need to use the web client through  www.bridgebase.com  to get voice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: against the odds slam   around 37 percent|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is rather familiar|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: maximum and hearts|pg||
nt|ady: a chance to catch up  if they can find the slam   though would be lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: good pass by N 2 H about limit with this distribution|pg||
nt|rv: even if declarer plays @C to @CK, Versace has only 8 tricks with @s suit not breaking beningly|pg||
mb|2N|nt|penseur9: this should not cause any problem for declairer|pg||
nt|penseur9: good point CK|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  This seems easy enough with @D breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  The system we think N-S play, more or less|pg||
nt|psyck:  this time they mey decide staying out with 2 key cards missing is a good idea after all|pg||
nt|wstuart: As a passed hand, with the opponents not competing, it is very likely that opener has a very good hand, so passing in this situation is quite reasonable.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Interestingly, had west opened in first seat, bidding 1NT with east has much more going for it.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: they should locate 2 key cards missing|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s obviously didn't show @s....maybe showed short @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: so Monaco has striked back - good news for the spectators (sorry Luxembourg :))|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia in the other semi has extended the lead and thus look strong contenders for the final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: identical bidding so far!|pg||
nt|psyck:  they are checking the back of the cards|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Wayne, welcome|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi Andre|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, if the defence switches to diamonds declarer may get locked in hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Actually dummy is blocked!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but that is not exactly easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still if there is one West who could find that defence, it is this one |pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Will probably be able to use defenders as stepping stone|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: however, East has no keys, so we should not see 4NT|pg||
nt|psyck:  5@c 03 this time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West knows two keys are missing now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: although it has to be the @DJ, otherwise the @D9 is a dummy entry|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure declarer is happy at the moment not being in 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play 5-card majors, so the @S9 is known to be a singleton  |pg||
nt|psyck:  now comfortable|pg||
nt|psyck:  Nunes neeeded to paly @dA 1st round|pg||
nt|henryb:  This will not be the easiest contract to make|pg||
nt|penseur9: not at all, even with 25 points|pg||
nt|psyck: @h towards T is normal, & with @d33, can get 3@h, 3@c, 2@c, 1!a|pg||
nt|psyck: the problem is doing it in right order & keeping wrong hands out|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: he has stolen !trick he desired, not enough though|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: gosh, this is complex|pg||
nt|penseur9:  very|pg||
nt|penseur9:  @S seems the best hope|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: dont seems to want to use rkc so they can avoid getting too high   though of course some days 6@H will make|pg||
nt|psyck:  W praying this wont be raised|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Val di Magra: http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Val_di_Vara_e_Magra.JPG&filetimestamp=20060811235645|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ugis: looks like -1 here and a push|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is more efficient, if hearts are trumps, to use 4@s as the keycard ask rather than 4NT|pg||
nt|ady: now praying K@H wrong|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|andyv:  Nunes not ready for the @d back|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: apparnetly 4@S was their rkc on this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: @h set up , not has to work on @d depending on whether they play @s or @c now, keep appropriate hand out|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|ugis: sorry 3 imps to Lux|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kerasidis: there is always a question about thiese hands ...whether to rebid a 4 card suit or the 6 card|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|penseur9: this is a difficult hand both for declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer reads the position he can make the hand, although he may not|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: when in doubt - run the long suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: excellent technique by Versace, playing for small extra chance of @SJ doubleton before trying for 3-3 break|pg||
nt|psyck:  now trying for some blockage & endplay|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: apparently|pg||
nt|psyck: now can just win & duck a @d to N|pg||
nt|psyck: most lines will make now|pg||
nt|henryb:  as long as N doesn't have @dQ10xx, declarer can win this and run the @d7|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: one loser at the end |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: interesting if West leads a low spade at trick 2 and East ducks the 9 or J  |pg||

mb|1H|nt|pelu: I would also open 2@D :):)|pg||
mb|d|an|4-5!S|nt|marlowepi: even within the context of French standards, 2D is marginal I think because of the playability in spades|pg||

nt|pelu: to day - spec in Europe - a lot of playeres know very well how to defend against Multi, so there are "many" who play Multi a little more contructiv that before |pg||
nt|marlowepi: here declarer can afford to suffer a ruff and it might well simplify the play for him by drawing a half-round of trumps:)|pg||

nt|psyck:  Versace did not want to bid 1st round with unpassed pd & unfav vul|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play double of 4@d here by North to show extras, double of cue bid below game level has diff meaning of cue bid above 4 level|pg||
nt|psyck:  NS fining the  double fit will help them save at appropriate level|pg||
nt|ady: most would open north hand|pg||
nt|ady: in spite  of their 10 card club fit   only 7 tricks for n/s in clubs|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|eweber: NS is playing a variable club system (Swedish style), 1@d shows 11-15 unbal with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c=FG with clubs or balanced or heart support|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski intends to show no wastage in @s  and plenty of working cards with his 4@s bid|pg||

nt|psyck:  you can also listen to the voice commentaary in this room, only via the browser link|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ugis: auction in open room was simple 1-2-4|pg||
nt|bg: non vul with N hand should be preempting  and now S will not allow EW to play a vul game|pg||
nt|wstuart: I wonder if 4@H would be a splinter at this point?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: 2@d=5+ hearts|pg||
nt|rv: great bidding so far|pg||
nt|psyck:  it sure helped W find the bid, whether to make or sac, it works|pg||
nt|psyck:  NS will take insurance at this vul i suppose|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ugis: I would certainly bid 3s like W did here|pg||
nt|bg: oops error in judgement by NS|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs, N-S better advised to take insurance though North might fancy his chances to defend this|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not too many problems on this one.|pg||
nt|andyv:  on 18, Nunes had to win A@d and lead @h back, perserving the K@d as entry to the @hs in E hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|kerasidis: what 3@c meant?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck:  2@d=4S, 11+ HCP, not yet GF|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|psyck:  2N = GF relay, was 3424 12, 2344 18, 4234 15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no sorry, can't read. 2@d shows spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  not an easy hand to play|pg||
nt|psyck:  nor to bid, not sure what the bids mean here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck:  3C = 4S-5H, 15+, sing. C|pg||
nt|rv: North might feel one of his rounded suits could fetch here though East's 4@s should have warned him|pg||
nt|psyck:  S should have bid 5@h instead of 5@s, that would have made the decision easier|pg||
nt|rv: now Versace in hot seat, will he get @c suit right?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 12-14; maybe they don't play the full Nightmare system |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 2@c was stuck for bid over 1@s and 2@d was checkback|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psyck:  3D = relay|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and maybe it has changed since 2005.....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kerasidis: weak clubs? hiding the dia fit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: looks like a nice lay for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  and on 18, W did go up with the A@d and 12 more imps to Allegra team|pg||
nt|psyck:  i'd guess 2@c probably a variety of hands & 2@d asked|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck:  Though their 1 level openings are generally 14+, 1@h can be 11 + when with 4 @s's|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bg: 3 clubs should be a fit showing jump  weak|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: looks kije 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: he might just play North for 5-5-1-2 and play for @CK doubleton inside|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec believes 2@c asked p to bid 2@d and then 2@h showed 4@h|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oosmanb:  Unlucky board for Allegra, 4@H seems like a decent contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6 imps back to Allegra|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry all, a bit of trouble here... all OK now|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, that looks more likely due to the 4@h bid, but N may not have doubled with that shape|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all. Sorry I'm late|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psyck:  gm Mike|pg||
nt|rv: Versace can play a) @CK doubleton with North b) @CKTX with North c) @CKXX with North and @CTX with South|pg||
nt|rv: gm Mike|pg||
nt|rv: only c) works here, I suspect he will play for a) or b) if he can smoke out distribution|pg||

nt|ady: good heart fit    but cards lay badly for n/s|pg||
nt|psyck:  few would chose 2@c at this vul with that hand indeed|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2@S= minors I guess|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@s a version of unusual over unusual|pg||
nt|psyck:  showing a good raise for pd here|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@S likely a limit raise or LR+ in @C.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Roland thinks it will go 1N all pass, which would send David Bird to the showers|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I think something happened with the replay...end position could not have been as shown|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kerasidis: interesting board|pg||
nt|penseur9: could EW get too high here?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I noticed that the All Blacks disposed handily of "Les Bleus"|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eweber: 3@c from West looks as if 2NT was kind of Lebensohl|pg||
nt|eweber: maybe transfer to @c|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|penseur9:  3@C seems indicate 0-7 with 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm told they are in 6@h on 18 next door|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: e/w overboard now |pg||
nt|wstuart: Should have an easy 10 tricks on a @S lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is too good for a Roland slam|pg||
pc|hT|nt|eweber: NS play neg. lead directing doubles from 3level if I remember their sys correctly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  3@C I meant|pg||
nt|elbec: nice choice by S who decided to pass|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck:  as the cards are both 4@s & 3N make|pg||
nt|psyck:  3N superior of course|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: typical Bergen would be 7-9, but the shape is good |pg||
nt|psyck:  3H = 5+H GF, 1-suiter or 4S-5H (was 4522 12, 2812 13, 3532 16)|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@d was no major|pg||
nt|rv: both pointed suits break beningly here, 4@s is a easy make|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: being careful with 5332 is a good adjustment for "the law"|pg||
nt|ady: as long as n/s find the diamond ruff  then down 1|pg||
nt|elbec: @d lead would have easily defeated this. let's see versace's play|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: if West bid bid 4@c, and it was passed out, then one can safely say that a misunderstanding has occurred  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot of players use Smolen here - not NS, obviously|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't see on NS card what 3@s is...looks like unspecified splinter perhaps|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|eweber: anyone here who knows the EW system?|pg||
nt|eweber: well, I learned that they play a strong club sys, but for the XX we can only assume that it might show a half stopper|pg||
nt|rv: though Allegra lost 7 IMPs on deal 3, they had outbid their opps and would have scored plenty of IMPs if @CK was South or if @CKTX was with North|pg||
nt|andyv:  so obviously 3@s is some type of slam try...either cue bid in @s or some shortness|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Smolen would be 3@s by South to show 4@S5@h |pg||
nt|psyck:  4@d cue with fit|pg||
nt|ady: south might be worried about a club ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently they use Reverse Smolen, as they play weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: however on the lay will not have much difficulty  which ever line taken|pg||
nt|psyck: both pairs here play attitude leads|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kerasidis: i would not pass east's hand |pg||
nt|eweber: hi Bruce, hi Denis, knowing the NS pair quite well and having their system file in front of me, I join in for the purpose of answering system questions|pg||
nt|eweber: hi all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|penseur9: I guess 6@H is cold|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck:  @s for 1 loser & @h for no loser, a 67% slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would imagine the 4@s, if not kickback, would show some type of @c control|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi elke :) thank you!|pg||
nt|penseur9: 3NT should make on any lead with extra tricks possible depending on play|pg||
nt|penseur9: somebody suggest that their are only 8 tricks: not really.. 5C 2D 1H 1S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: well, that won't cause too many problems|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sT|nt|wstuart: In fact, after a @S now and a @H shift by N, west will have to misguess @H not to take 10 tricks anyway.  However, he may misguess @H given the bidding.|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like leading twice toward the AQ10 of @s would be the percentage play|pg||
nt|psyck:  the double fin with low to @st the % play in @s for 1 loser|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm pretty sure 4@s was kickback and 5@d showed 2 keys|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ugis: 9 tricks possible, but must guess everything|pg||

nt|psyck:  click the play button next to the commentators name in the voice commentary area next to the char area|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes there was - South had the ace-king :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North couild have helped his partner on lead by doubling the 4@s cue bid|pg||
nt|wstuart: The mundane @S lead at the other table gave up an IMP.  Benito did misguess which @H honor North held;  not surprising.|pg||
nt|psyck:  can use 2@d entries for @h finesses in 4@s?|pg||

nt|ady: e/w may make 9 tricks in either major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently Garozzo plays every day on BBO|pg||
nt|rv: will Zaleski double this to show major?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|rv: Versace might just bid 3@s here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: over this kind of transfer. North has two bids available. He can bid either 3@c or 3@d, so some pairs use them to distinguish the kind of minor suit fit|pg||
nt|rv: if Zaleski had acted on 1n, E-W might have got to game, here I suspect they will stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: Pattacini's 1n opening might just have worked here|pg||
nt|elbec: NS open 1@d with 4@d and 5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but fairly normal to lead your own suit after the 3@C support raise  |pg||
nt|psyck:  4@h rather, as 4@s has danger of @h ruff|pg||
nt|wstuart: They may well play 4@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb:  I mightve bid 4@d as North here, nothing to be ashamed about in that hand (except perhaps @S quality)|pg||
nt|psyck: Papi mentioned in an interview a few years ago that he is not as fast as he used to be, but those who watch him in the games he plays regularly on BBO know that he is still very ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sharp|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eweber: NS play a variable club system (Sedish style), 2@d promises 55|pg||
nt|eweber: of course South can reach N with @s then|pg||

nt|psyck:  no entry to hand for @s finesse|pg||
nt|rv: again winning decision by Versace, I might have just bid 3@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  the 3rd @h would work if he guesses|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if East might have bid directly over 1NT, rather than waiting until the bidding got to the three level?|pg||
nt|andyv:  only question is 4@s or 3N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: should go -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: take the cash|pg||
nt|psyck:  but he has lesses @d than @h & may misguess like other room|pg||

nt|psyck:  now will make|pg||
nt|rv: on this bidding, I would have just bid 3@s with West hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wstuart: 3 rounds of @C, followed by a 4th @C makes 4@H touchy.|pg||
nt|penseur9: very difficult hand to bid here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: depends if there are any limits on the 2NT bid|pg||

nt|rv: partner can't misconstrue (play him for more)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: are they using screens?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently so - thanks Roland|pg||

mb|p|nt|ugis: ns might be in trouble here|pg||

nt|psyck: @s lead?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: very surprising he passed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT would be nice, except that a lot of pairs play some Lebensohl-like device after the double |pg||
nt|psyck:  5@c timid there|pg||
nt|psyck:  but not clear what else he courld do|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's going to be very hard for North to bid a slam now.|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|psyck:  yes, I was sure of an x there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: note that East doubled 3@h at the other table!|pg||
nt|psyck:  2N nat would be nice, but surely hardly anyone plays it that way nowadays|pg||
nt|rv: I would double 3@h as well|pg||
nt|psyck:  3 is more of a problem, but with perfect hape, matx values, intermediary cards, x of 2@h was standout|pg||
nt|rv: to CK's question, I play modified lebensohl here from West hand on East's double (even if passed hand)|pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays  going down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c=GF balanced or with @cs|pg||
nt|rv: we do have Voice commentary here, Roland and team in action|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: here, double by lauria does not mean " they are cooked", it rather means " pard, i d like to go to 5@s, what do you think?"|pg||
nt|ady: dbl seems odd    when  east is on lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe he is planning to lead a cunning @S9|pg||
nt|henryb:  If Madala guesses @d, he can make this|pg||
nt|psyck: declarer prefers this lead :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@h, 1@d, 1@c if dec gets it right|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ady: needs  to unblock|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh wow|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   not neccessary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if he had doubled, we might be watching a contract of 2@hx - West has good trumps for a pass |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|ady: 5@C was the making contract for n/s if west does not find A@H lead|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ugis: dbl with N cards surely not everybodies choice, but he was lucky not to be punished|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i am curius about the range of the 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: poor east   all the aces and kings running away|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C looks optimistic|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck:  Maybe Fantunes have some systemic gadget to do better here|pg||
nt|andyv:  good bidding into an easy contract|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|rv: sry 10 always|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||

nt|kerasidis: so unlimited|pg||
nt|eweber: I have no idea, I only know the NS system a bit|pg||
nt|kerasidis: most likely 8-11 or 14+ (12-13 would be 2NT), i am told|pg||
nt|kerasidis: but not sure|pg||
nt|rv: a few knowledgable specs are telling me they will double with East hand even on auction p-(2@h)-p-(4@h)|pg||
nt|cuan: not good lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eweber: this it what I meant with "or GF"|pg||
nt|kerasidis: an other strange|pg||
nt|kerasidis: how oja bids 6 missing 2 aces|pg||

nt|wstuart: It's not clear if NS would have been in a force over 4@D had south passed.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: well, he hasn't made it yet - but you somehow suspect that NS will be entering 1310 shoprtly|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck:  RV, my question of more where you intend to end up once pd doubles 2@h, 3N or something else|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: old joke - if I'd bid diamonds, would you lead spades.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 21 Garozzo made 4@sx. Club king overtaken by the ace for a diamond switch, but now there was a ruffing club finesse |pg||
nt|rv: I presume 2n showed 5@h+4m limited range, 3@c could be relay, 3@h showed 4@d, I am guessing here:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ugis: if E plays low...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with 1065 in spades, i'd need a good reason not to lead them - like AKQJX in hearts, perhaps  |pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|psyck: we will have 7 rounds of relays now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: they got back 1 trick in @h suit, still lost a trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|rv: even Pattacini didn't feel like opening 1n here|pg||
nt|elbec: NS openings are usually very "sound". |pg||
nt|elbec: so i was expecting a pass by North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, You wouldn't open 2@D to say, I have 18-19 balanced, and then 2NT to say, Did you hear me, partner? I have 18-19 balanced. There has to be a good reason to bid 2NT |pg||
mb|4D|nt|psyck:  overcalling|pg||
nt|andyv:  easy auction|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: sry, didn't see Versace's opening|pg||
nt|henryb:  The voice commenters are discussing signalling styles|pg||
nt|penseur9: they should take a short break so we get compairisions with the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: NS is allowed to open a 14-16 NT with 5card M but this is not the hand to use such an option|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: 5@C presumably pass/correct|pg||
nt|rv: since 2@s is limited to 14, Fantoni not worried about slam prospects and bid game w/o giving information to opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: making 3 now|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder what pass of 4@d would be|pg||
nt|psyck: if W denied @h control, 5@c will point @c weakness with E|pg||
mb|5N|nt|psyck:  Bocchi overcalled 1N here & got to 3N|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H a decent save   especially if diamond ruff not found|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 5@s-2 on the 6@Hx hand - 15 big imps|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ugis: so 5 more boards...and Monaco must hope for some big boards|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 9 top tricks if not dia led|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@s shows a rather good raise|pg||
nt|bg: great contract no play for 4 spades 3nt unbeatable|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: some use bergen but it is one of the most controversial convention|pg||
nt|psyck:  exciting boards & swings, slam already bid on 4 of 7 boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that opera seems to have many fat ladies, these days|pg||
nt|penseur9: I've just been told that "Allegra", is named after the ill niece Allegra Versace of Signore Versace. She does own the trademark "Versace".|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not like bidding 2N with the E hand. I would start with 2@h|pg||
mb|7S|nt|rv: @s lead required to trouble declarer here|pg||
nt|psyck:  with the trump break, will still go down |pg||

nt|eweber: 4333 should be treated like 3card support, no matter which system you play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and claim shortly thereafter|pg||
nt|penseur9:  only claimed +1|pg||
nt|rv: rare error by Versace, he needed to guess whether Zaleski had promotable @d or @SQ, tough one|pg||

nt|penseur9: same results in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: this might give Angelini a chance for a few IMLs|pg||

nt|psyck:  more swings coming as they did not get to 6@d on deal 23 other room|pg||
nt|rv: agree Mike|pg||
nt|wstuart: So, north won't run from 2@H with a misfit unless he has a self sufficient suit of his own.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  2N = limit plus including a hand too good for a direct splinter|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: weak NT fopr NS|pg||
nt|ritong: a clever cue in pard's known shortness|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|psyck: it could have just shown the @c cue that E denied having|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  good suit, shape, NV, etc. make is a clear opening for N|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eweber: 1@c was any 11-13 bal or a strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: this looks tough to make|pg||

mb|3H|nt|psyck:  4333 min, will stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  though the trumps are tempting|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: would 5@d have been a cost-effective solution?|pg||
nt|penseur9: sometimes you must resist temptation :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: first thing is to make @c right after the 1@c opening...|pg||
nt|eweber: 1NT 17-19 now|pg||
nt|ady: will have tp play on spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  If @c aren't 3-0, the hand is cold. If E has the 3, you will find out. and if West has the 3, you need to unblock the 8 so that you can win a second @c cheaply in the S hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: ultra modern opening, ZAR point or any other hand eval system will insist you open|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's easy to say 2he shouldn't switch to a spade because that will give a trick", but that is because we see all 52 cards |pg||
nt|psyck:  Zar basically factors HCP, Shape, & Controls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s obviously forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: i don't think so, considering how @d and @c split|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck:  passing would have worked better|pg||
nt|penseur9: for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: hope to make 2 spades  2 hearts 3 diamonds and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|ady: playing king of spades would have been better|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|rv: will anyone consider 4@c splinter (limited to 13 hcp or so) with South instead of 2@h followed by 3@s?|pg||
nt|wstuart: I was asked:  " is papi playing more traditional systems than he used to?  "   It depends on the partner.  Over the past 10 years I've played against Garozzo in 4 dirrerent serious ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: ...|pg||
nt|psyck:  as Oscar Wilde would say, can resist anything but temptation...|pg||
nt|wstuart: partnerships.  In all of these , he has used std initial openings, with lots of different gadgets starting in on the 2nd round of the auction.|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||

nt|bg: S had to keep 3dia and N discard 10 9 dia to have any chance|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|nt|eweber: 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, the last time East opened a stroing 1NT he was -1310. That won't happen this time|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||

nt|psyck: will not be fun for whoever gets to play this deal|pg||
nt|penseur9: would you say 4@S makes for EW?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: north might balance|pg||
nt|queequeg: Running Scores http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but we will see North's views on protection|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d shows 18-19 bal here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: that's a big order|pg||
nt|rv: Nunes's 5@s seems to be master bid (not complimentary) here|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like down 1 territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not easy vul|pg||
nt|elbec: nice stop here by EW|pg||
nt|ritong: with everything under control, if they land in some doubled @ss, north will play his trump at trick 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  what else could it mean?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT making with the lovely club position   |pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: poor suit   and poor shape |pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, sensible pass |pg||
nt|penseur9: yes looks like an easy make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however 3@C does sound rather to-play-ish|pg||
nt|psyck: surely not|pg||
nt|penseur9: two spades and a club looser|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: if playing classical Bergen, 3@d=9-11 with 4-card support. very maximum here with five trumps|pg||
nt|ady: this may well be down   |pg||
nt|ritong: same goes if they land in some undoubled @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: at least East didn't pass 4@c - he has learned his lesson|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm no 4@h cue|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, we all know loonies who would bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: over 2@d, what would 3@d by East be?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so South has done rather well here|pg||
nt|penseur9: very|pg||

nt|wstuart: Yes, actually, it was more like 2001 when I was playing against Benito and Lea about twice a week - on OKbridge then.|pg||
nt|rv: it says he is trying to mastermind the auction, Nunes has opened 2@s and has no extra redeeming feature, doesn't know what partner holds, should have passed|pg||
nt|mathat: -1or 90 % -2 10 %|pg||
nt|psyck: & @hA|pg||

nt|rv: we have ask Roland who is invisible, I don't know their sys well enough:)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I guess I'm wrong :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  a @h loser also|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck:  SLAVINSKY LEADS:|pg||
nt|psyck:  When we have one or more honours we lead in direct counting: small with an odd number of cards, high with an even number of cards.|pg||
nt|psyck:  When we have no honours we lead in reverse counting: small with an even number of cards, high with an odd number of cards.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: because you could play it as a transfer to 3@H and folow up with 3NT - but that means East declares 3NT if that is the final contract|pg||
nt|psyck:  Roland is doing voice commentary, you can see  him is using the browser|pg||
nt|psyck:  oh, the Before BBO era|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  Apparently 3@c is invitational with 6+@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be a 9 imp swing|pg||
nt|mathat: 9 or 12|pg||
nt|rv: Bocchi should avoid @d shift here|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|penseur9:  will the hand play different from E vs W in open room|pg||
nt|psyck:  10 is not considered an honour but with 10x we lead with 10.|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S started this set down 21 imps. I do not see (except from the scores) why N-S should think that they are now down 60.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psyck:  he had 1 extra @s & passed pd, still it is quite a view to choose to bid 5@s|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a diamond lead beats it, of course, but how can South lead that? |pg||
nt|psyck:  3@d on 2@d would be 5@s & 4@h|pg||
nt|henryb:  and another club|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: not the best switch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they have got both 3NT and 4@h declared by West, so all is well|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eweber: as cards lie 3NT is unbeatable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it would be interesting to see the results of a computer simulation of 2@S by North- what the percentages are |pg||

mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: and they are still in touch. Long way to go|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam for e/w|pg||
nt|psyck:  Those using the Windows version of BBO can just open a 2nd Browser window to listen to Voice commentary: http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743|pg||
nt|rv: best 11 hcp with bal hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  6 will be bid in practice|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard to bid after 3@s|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: boards like that where something depends on the lead are a bit random, so perhaps a flat board is a fair enough result|pg||
nt|ady: will likely play 6@D|pg||
nt|ady: or 6@C|pg||
nt|psyck:  lighter than usual in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s 10-13 with 5+@S. Might be weaker in third seat :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  would be better with @sA in 4 card @h|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm told that Fantoni is abou to fail in the 3NT which Lauria made|pg||
nt|penseur9: on board  7|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Manos:)|pg||
nt|rv: not my choice of O/C with Bocchi's hand though I suspect I would be in minority in modern bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 5NT OK?|pg||
nt|psyck:  not to mention that 2 suit bids are supposed to be unbalanced|pg||
nt|psyck:  passed pd & NV, many would o/c|pg||
nt|andyv:  he probably bid it on the slow trick count theory|pg||
mb|4D|nt|queequeg: Running Scores http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good 6@S, best played by North|pg||
nt|ritong: system starts with a wrongsiding here|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, he is going down|pg||
nt|wstuart: I'm a bit surprised at teh 2@C opening.  Not only is this a difficult pattern to bid out after 2@C, but it will be even more vulnerable to preemption.|pg||
nt|penseur9: first blood for Angelini on  8 with OR in 6@S only... 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d is all E needed to hear for 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: 3 nt for ew|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  sacrifice to much|pg||
nt|rv: y CK, A in longer suit better|pg||
nt|rv: 3@c by Madala is mixed raise|pg||
nt|psyck:  takes the 1 level away from opps|pg||
nt|psyck:  jump cues often played as mixed raise in competition|pg||
nt|rv: many folks play cue (good 10+) to show good raise and jump cue to show mixed raise (6-8)|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's what it looks like here|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rv: Zaleski thinking of correcting 2@h to 3@c here?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which might be rather difficult to manage now|pg||
nt|wstuart: Preemption either by the opps or by pard, as in this case.  ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: W can pass|pg||
nt|penseur9: how high will EW go?|pg||
nt|psyck: E just reconfirming suit quality|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard to imagine that W has both controls|pg||
mb|6S|nt|eweber: board 22 might cost some imps but as board 21 was duplicated in the closed room, I assume this match is over|pg||
nt|queequeg: next match will be Reggio Emilia - Angelini|pg||
nt|psyck:  2 suiter are tough to handle after 2@c, but this is too strong to try anything else maybhe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: @c lead best here|pg||
nt|ady: the transfer response works agains n/s here   |pg||
nt|psyck:  i assume S showed red suits, & this is pick a slam|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't know - the @DQ is a pretty weak card a priori.  If you get past the natural 1@C opening, you have a very easy road to showing both strength and pattern.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|rv: Pattacini could have worked out to lead a trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 6NT by North ok too - also difficult to mange |pg||
nt|psyck:  wow, nice|pg||
pc|hA|nt|reisig: Not much to the play :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  maybe 3@s was just shortness, & 5N GSF|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: might get out for two down - two club finesses|pg||
nt|queequeg: at 21.15 italian time, 15.15 EST|pg||
nt|rv: I can't see Versace scoring this, good switch|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is not a good grand, however it makes.|pg||
nt|penseur9: can almost claim after getting trump out|pg||
nt|henryb:  can claim|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
mc|13|nt|mdgraham: sry, lost connxtn|pg||
nt|wstuart: The odds are 52% for teh @D suit to come in for no losers, plus the small chance of an opening ruff.|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm sure any grand that makes is considered good... after the fact :)|pg||
nt|rv: I am told by knowledgable specs that Lauria recently O/Ced on KTXXX, XX, XX, XXXX White vs Red|pg||

nt|mdgraham: very shapely deal.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as you said, Venky, not an advert for light openings|pg||
nt|rv: 2 more segments after this rite?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and West gets another chance....|pg||
nt|psyck:  ye, today|pg||
nt|ady: very likely to be flat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another likely 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: ah, we may start having compairisons soon with or|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now that N hand is what I think a weak 2@s looks like :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|eweber: the last few boards have been what a team with a big lead must be wishing for: quite boring|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: amusing auction next door. Everybody bid suits they haven't got |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, the previous opening was AAK. |pg||
nt|rv: just 25 IMPs, still enough boards for Val Di Magra to turn this around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s?|pg||
nt|henryb:  If I thought I were well ahead, it would not occur to me to act with the E hand|pg||
nt|psyck:  not going well for Angelini this set at all, they are in 6@s other room here|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s could be @s+minor if it is popular Woolsey|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: Does anyone know at what time will the final start?|pg||
nt|queequeg: this is the last board of the Semifinal. The final will be Luxembourg-Estonia|pg||
nt|queequeg: 14.30 italian time|pg||
nt|queequeg: 8.30 EST, 13.30 UK|pg||
nt|ugis: thx :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when you hold the South hand, partner usually bids 3@c - and East doubles for penalties |pg||
nt|mdgraham: take care of the tens, and the ones can take care of themselves|pg||
nt|ady: needs a spade lead to defeat 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It will be interesting to see if North chooses 6@S or 6NT |pg||
nt|penseur9: Open Room OR that is|pg||
nt|mathat: yes @s +min|pg||
nt|mathat: 6 NT by S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|elbec: would u overcall 2@d with E cards?|pg||
nt|penseur9: at the rate the OR is playing, Roland might again ffinish the voice commentaries in the OR again today|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW can make 3NT here - nine toppers. The power of aces (and, of course, the odd solid seven-card suit)  |pg||
nt|penseur9: That is a very light opening for East|pg||
mb|2S|nt|queequeg: thank you very much to Ugis Jansons :) Our commentator :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  for vg sched adjusted to your timezone.  Make it your home page!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: clubs not in the auction|pg||
nt|rv: Madala has made practical bid with everyone bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s practical|pg||
nt|mathat: practical bid|pg||
nt|rv: same comment by 3 of us, how frequent it is on BBO:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow, almost unanimous in the practical department|pg||
nt|psyck:  maybe, but N's @s could be better on a good day|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  this will be another double digit loss for the angelini team|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i would raptorize it:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, so much for 3NT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Not wild abt 3@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe just shows six spades|pg||
nt|reisig: and 2@s showed 5?|pg||
nt|ady: slam even around 50 percent if played by east|pg||
nt|ritong: google "raptor bridge" if you want to know more about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: well, somehow the timetable on the web is wrong for this particular tournament :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S must have shown a fragment - can't really be natural, given the 3@D bid. Might have bid 4@H as well|pg||
nt|rv: 4@s is make here, 5@h would be 2 down|pg||
nt|psyck:  This session has been a quiet low scoring one so far, there were slams & doubled games every other deal previous session|pg||
nt|penseur9: 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|penseur9: hands I should say|pg||
pc|d3|nt|queequeg: that could be because they changed the times last minute|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even +1 on the double club hook|pg||
nt|penseur9: I can't figure this one out :(|pg||
nt|penseur9: seems EW may get to high here|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: This can be beaten on @DA and another |pg||
nt|reisig: Time for 4@s|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|psyck:  E could be worried of 2 @c losers|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, you always think/assume opps are saving w/o values|pg||
nt|psyck:  he just doubled to keep me happy|pg||
nt|rv: E-W make upto 11 tricks in @s strain|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mathat: maybe play x@c|pg||
nt|henryb:  safest play is just to drive the high clubs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck:  hmm, now he will make 11|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: ah, but East is on lead|pg||
nt|ady: Valdemagra have picked up 20 imps in 2 recent hands|pg||
nt|ady: slam was missed on hand 27th|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and they led a club, too|pg||
nt|penseur9: this lead should make life easier for declarer|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|eweber: last board for this half at this table while the other room is playing board 8 right now|pg||
nt|kerasidis: last board now ty elke bruce and all kibbs|pg||
nt|kerasidis: and of course our operator|pg||
nt|eweber: and you :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|ady: right to be worried    apart from diamond finesse needed if north on lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  & did not want to risk it with the lead likely marked|pg||
nt|psyck:  w/o the @c he would have happily taken 10|pg||
nt|rv: CK, South will be caught in minor suit squeeze in any case rite?|pg||
nt|rv: even on best defense, Zaleski would have made an OT|pg||
nt|psyck:  inddded, looks like there was a showup|pg||
nt|mathat: nows S the Garozzo hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the values are all certainly marked|pg||
nt|mathat: and 4-4 th minors after the lead|pg||

nt|rv: N-S playing strong @c?|pg||

nt|psyck:  *in GF|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think Blackwood is going to get wheeled out real soon|pg||
nt|rv: yes, confirmed N-S play strong @c based sys|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although it's 5 imps in - 3NT was one down next door  |pg||

mb|p|nt|reisig: hmmm 1NT?|pg||
nt|reisig: whew :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  If I bid 4@s here, my partner would have x/Axxxx/xxx/Axxx|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@c is either 16+ or natural (or both)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: maybe 1@s - Pass 1nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's better|pg||
nt|reisig: what now?|pg||
nt|reisig: Maybe X...or Pass|pg||
nt|ady: best to forget the diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck:  now everyone wants to do something, just don't know what|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@c possible|pg||
nt|ady: naybe 2NT   clubs or diamonds?|pg||
nt|henryb:  they have been discussing whether Cappelletti or DONT is worth|pg||
nt|henryb:  worse|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2NT I think is LR+ with 3+ trumps.  3@D shows bal with extra values.|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@d = not min ..not slam|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: maybe|pg||
nt|ady: may find difficulty in bidding to 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes good point|pg||
nt|rv: coffee deal here, all games make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: although with three smnall spades and two small hearts, colour me chicken|pg||
nt|psyck:  will S try looking for 3rd round control in @c?|pg||
nt|rv: South could have splintered with 3@s, then on 4@d can blackwood though all roads lead to GS|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: Now Val di Magra is only 18 IMPs behind Allegra team|pg||
nt|psyck:  Thx Richie|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi Richie.|pg||
nt|reisig: hiya :)|pg||
nt|rv: 3@c showed @h fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: hi Richie|pg||
nt|penseur9: everything appears to be sitting favourably here|pg||
nt|psyck:  This is the 58th Italian Championship for Garozzo i'm told.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Dear Bill, please look at my partner's probable hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  I think if S had bid 3@s, West would have bid 4@c|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: 1@c is 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced. Not sure what the double implies|pg||
nt|psyck:  6@c after RKC response may ask for 3rd round control...|pg||
nt|rv: South's worry for GS will be North holding 3rd round control of @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 5@D now to check on @hQ|pg||
nt|rv: South still needs to find out both @HQ as well as 3rd control @c control, maybe he will chance GS even w/o explicit 3rd round control|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: yes - 33 imps in 3 boards!|pg||
nt|henryb:  but with 3-3 spades, there is no particularly good reason to avoid 3N|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|penseur9: however, to make 54 IMPs in last 4 hands for Val Di Magra appears next to impossible|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: that 6@H jump probably denies any side king|pg||
nt|rv: as a few knowledgable specs point if North showed @HQ with 5n, then South could have still bid 6@c|pg||
nt|psyck:  S will have to gamble on 3rd round @c control now|pg||
nt|rv: some play 5n response to queen ask to show 2 side kings and @HQ|pg||
nt|psyck:  5N would be showing trump Q & unshowable K's for some|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, more efficient to use 5N as showing the queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  bye|pg||
pc|s7|nt|penseur9: bye Henry|pg||
nt|rv: this deal would be lot more interesting in MPs or BAM scoring, deal to relax in IMPs scoring|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
mc|11|nt|psyck:  likely the unbalanced variation as N chose 3@c|pg||

nt|wstuart: a 3rd @S.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Bocchi reasonably treated his hand as worth 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: incidentally even in OR, famed Bocchi-Madala pair didn't bid GS very scientifically, they also bid it w/o asking for 3rd round @c control|pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ9+AKQ+AQ10xx+xx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when your opponents bid a laydown grand slam there is nothing you can do but hope that your teammates bid it as well|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d, 18-19 bal once again|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski has a problem here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s-2N-pass?|pg||
nt|psyck:  with @d's coming in, 4@s should make here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score this time   around 10 tricks in diamonds |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: 1@C probably a catch-all for EW, as they play a strong NT   |pg||
nt|reisig: 3NT|pg||
nt|reisig: everyone agree 1@h ?|pg||
nt|psyck:  he will surely not pass 2N|pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps for the leaders on hand 29   part score in clubs open room|pg||
nt|ritong: then, a last set of 16 boards to decide who will play in the final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South did indeed bid 3@S directly at the other table, and bought the contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Roland, would you like to be in this grand?|pg||
nt|henryb:  not that bad: just need hearts and to guess the @c|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck:  1@h not my style|pg||
nt|elbec: brave reopening by Lanzarotti|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: this hand is an excellent lesson|pg||
nt|henryb:  and 6@h is not that bad really, especially with a @s lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: when you have no clear reason to think your side might make a game contract, just give up early, even in a known 4/3 major fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much that West can do here, it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  you think W won't need to finesse for the J@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: running scores: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|psyck: Grand is too good for Roland here, he only needs 12.89% or better (does not bid slams requiring 3 finesses)|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I bid 1NT = bal|pg||
nt|psyck:  Ace & a 5 carder &  a 4 card maj|pg||
nt|psyck:  yeah well, what do i know|pg||
nt|rv: I presume 2@d opening denies 5M|pg||
nt|mathat: if the lead is @d and nows the @h 2-2 beter to play 7|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henryb:  Hedy thinks N should let them play. But as the saying goes, "Why should they go down when we can?"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 2@S, but no guarantees - and it wil be a 4/3 fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no, prefer 1NT. |pg||
nt|reisig: 3@s ..end???|pg||
nt|psyck:  wow, they bid better than us :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hmm. Something has Happened|pg||
nt|reisig: not likely|pg||
nt|reisig: that 3@s ..was 3NT"|pg||
nt|rv: that makes his pass a lot easier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-2@S-2NT would be an invite with four spades - East probably didn't think he was worth the invite |pg||
nt|psyck:  He has limited entries for finesses, will just play for drop or ruff it out|pg||
nt|rv: Fantoni's pass is bit timid in my view, he should atleast try for game with 3@c|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@c was the choice other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: aha|pg||
nt|psyck:  aaah, more like it|pg||
nt|rv: if that option was available, I might have taken it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wstuart: Over 1NT a popular method is to preaccept a xfr by bidding a doubleton.  Over 2NT, however, many prefer to cuebid a side source of tricks when preaccepting a xfr.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: more like it    but likely to go down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|penseur9:  I'm one of them|pg||
nt|psyck:  but non vul & their bids already limited in their system (they both had max for their bids)|pg||
nt|psyck:  E's hand still too tempting not to try|pg||
nt|rv: Fantoni had already shown 14+ with his choice of opening in their system, a few kibs feel he did have a case for passing in his system|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|psyck:  and 1@s limited it to about this strength|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wstuart: 4@H was (obviously) a re-xfr.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|penseur9:  they ask the more experienced :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck:  yes, i would have certainly invited at least, & 3N would have made here on normal @s lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|psyck:  played by W, could have got a @s lead|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rv: atleast 9 tricks now w/o @d shift|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: tried to pin stiff J@D|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|penseur9:  Please adress your written questions to me please|pg||
nt|psyck:  oh, but not in that sequence|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: if west decides to fight, it would be via 2@h i think  passing 1@s already indicates 3+ cards|pg||
nt|ritong: and very likely exactly three|pg||
nt|henryb:  once you guess clubs you get 4 club tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
mc|12|nt|psyck:  S would be on lead then & lead @d|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9: This will be the last hand in the CR...  More great bridge comming with 4 more rounds tomorrow and the last on Sunday... hope to see you all here then|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@d = 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|psyck:  upgraded with good 5 carder & controls|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha right one more round after this sorry|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 more boards and the Angelini team will get a much needed break.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psyck:  1 more deal , yes|pg||
nt|psyck:  next round at 9:15AM CET|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzpt: segment 2 start in 21.15 local time|pg||
nt|henryb:  So we can predict based on trends that there will be 13 imps scored on these last two boards|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerability wrong for a n/s save|pg||
nt|ritong: an other good lesson|pg||
nt|henryb:  Unless there is a large unexpected swing on this board, "The fat lady just sang!" :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: go quiet with no sure fit, go wild with sure fits, especially @ss|pg||
nt|psyck:  sorry, 10AM CET|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: rehi, sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW might get to 4@S here |pg||
nt|penseur9: with 2 boards left to play, it's reasonable to say that the Allegra team will be in the finals|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mathat: 5 @c -1 for EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  The most extreme case I say of a "5 or 7 hand" was a "2 or 7 hand" in no trump|pg||
mb|2S|nt|elbec: 5@c are really too many...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: it should go down though|pg||
nt|henryb:  Over 14 boards, 90 imps have been scored, which is almost exactly 6 1/2 a board. So I predict another 13. :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Benito is ready to leave :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  yes, would have had some chance only if played by W & lead not found|pg||
nt|psyck:  a muiderberg style 2@s opening would have worked better this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 2@s opener, EW had a better chance of reaching 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  enabling EW to find 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: another way to say it Mike :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at a cautious guess, yes. Well done to them. They have played very well this set |pg||
nt|penseur9: On hand 11 where we were in 7@D here makink the OR played 3NT+4 for 14 IMPs for Allegra|pg||
nt|penseur9: making even :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|reisig: 4@s ..wow|pg||
nt|reisig: 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: gosh, 4@s. Going it a bit|pg||
nt|psyck:  4@s= I have 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|ritong: feeling protected with odds, henry?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two hearts and a diamond to lose?|pg||
nt|elbec: 5 imps coming....|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: awkward on repeated heart leads|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: 2@h is retransfer back to @s?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: this  can make if Verace gets diamond position right  and no heart lead|pg||
nt|elbec: only @h lead...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed. Nothice that 5@c is down 2 on a @d lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: with trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now just hammer away with hearts|pg||
nt|elbec: nicely done Lanzarotti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: so what do we know?|pg||
nt|ritong: south has cards, more or less balanced|pg||
nt|ritong: north has a bunch of @cs|pg||
nt|fulldire: if west put the King of @H in dummy he makes|pg||
nt|fulldire: now 1 off|pg||
nt|ritong: and probably a high card onside, like the @d K|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think North's invitation is minimum, and South's accept is not even close|pg||
nt|penseur9: very well indeed|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: so if north is singleton @h we are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: And in all the other sets too, come to that |pg||
pc|sA|nt|reisig: That bid NEVER entered my mind :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: hence, playing the @h K was highly possible|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|queequeg: the next round is starting at 14.30 italian time, 13.30 UK, 8.30 EST|pg||
nt|rv: some play lead of King or Ace and shifting to short suit shows stiff and leading other honor and shifting shows doubleton|pg||
nt|fulldire: not easy but possible expecially for versace depend on lead how they lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: stil  needs @DK down in three, for the heart discard from dummy - which it does|pg||
nt|penseur9: right you are|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|penseur9: is everybody holding their breath here :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Making 7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c2|nt|rv: this distinction will help partner in ducking when appropriate, doesn't matter here|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|henryb:  If Versace leads a low @d, N has to grab the K and lead a second @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  But then there aren't enough trumps|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, squeeze|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck:  E promised a big hand, but as you say, with 4333, it was certainly aggresive|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: nice phrase, Krishna - "certainly aggressive". We know what you mean :)  |pg||
nt|reisig: A well deserved result :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck:  Voice commentary will continue in other room after this table finishes|pg||
nt|fulldire: yes he needed also the 8 of @H in the hand to make the play i suggested|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd North|pg||
nt|fulldire: the 8 of @D|pg||
nt|henryb:  but he will make it anyway|pg||
nt|henryb:  true|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fulldire: great lead by north|pg||
nt|henryb:  down 1 even with everything going well|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|c3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  Declarer would have done better to lead a low trump rather than the 10|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  then he would have more high trumps in the end position|pg||

nt|psyck:  all those @c bids should prvent the lead, time to bid slam :)|pg||

nt|rv: can declarer cross ruff and still get home after losing trick to @SK?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@c or 5@d are just as unbeatable|pg||
mb|4H|nt|reisig: Nice hand to bid with ...over X :)|pg||
nt|ady: just what Fantoni wanted to hear|pg||
nt|psyck:  on a more serious not, 3@c may show partial stop|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|psyck:  this match is closer of the two SF's|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|rv: this lead should give more than fighting chance for Pattacini|pg||
nt|psyck:  So we will see them again next session|pg||
nt|ritong: i think it is better that way, henry|pg||
nt|ritong: we probably should do same.|pg||
nt|ritong: and, in a smaller world, have a glass together afterwards:)|pg||
nt|penseur9: the finals will start in about two and a half hour... don't miss it|pg||
nt|wstuart: Usually, 3@C shows extra values without a more clear bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Often it will contain 3@C and highlight @H (opener's suit) as a potential weakness.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: good 3NT bid - West knows East has a diamond fit |pg||
nt|penseur9:  I wish to thank Mike Graham my co commentator|pg||
nt|penseur9:  bye bye all|pg||
nt|henryb:  Notict that they do not have a wasted J|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Any bets on the lead?|pg||
nt|psyck:  maybe both think they are showing partial stops|pg||
nt|fulldire: bravo benito|pg||
mb|6D|nt|rv: I suspect 1 down here|pg||
nt|wstuart: He may well avoid a @C lead on this hand - east may think @Hs is the likely weakness.|pg||
nt|wstuart: West, I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Well, Roland, in the previous sessions that I have done with both forms, any thanks to writers has only come after prompting|pg||
nt|reisig: Automatic ....for him !|pg||
nt|wstuart: nice|pg||
nt|mathat: if Bocchi RDBL=A or K @h madala play 4 @h and made|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: sry once declarer loses trick to @SK, no real chance for making|pg||
nt|psyck:  well, at least this tightens up the match|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes, |pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|rv: if Pattacini had played @s to @SA, he might have scored especially on @DJ lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  oh oh|pg||
nt|wstuart: West had the info that east didn't overcall 1@H over 1@D, so his @H can;t be all that great.|pg||
nt|reisig: No comment|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes but a 28 -18 score for 16 hands is certainly tight scoring|pg||
nt|psyck:  we will leave the last comment at good lead|pg||
