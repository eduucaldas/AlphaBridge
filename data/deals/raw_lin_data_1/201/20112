mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|eweber: hi everyone, welcome back to the 2nd half of this final|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: 2@d presumably a Multi, or maybe just a weak two|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eweber: what a hand to start with!|pg||
nt|rv: E-W should score this comfortably, @c strain might have fetched 10 tricks though|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, West will enquire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's obvious now that East has hearts - it's the only suit he hasn't bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: told 3@c maximum, 3@s=hearts|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rv: E-W should compete to 3@c here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck:  They bid that way to right side |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  could well go overboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think soemone had better bid hearts soon|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: Guisy, is Allegra a full 6 member team with Sementa and Duboin 3rd pair sitting out this segment?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eweber: at the other table East has jumped to 4@c over an art. 1@c opening|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|psyck:  wonder if 4@s was kickback|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|queequeg: welcome to Ugins Jansons :)|pg||
nt|ady: slam  can be played 2 ways   ruffing finesse of KQ@C    or  a squeeze on south if south has A@C   and Q@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it, 4NT=1 key|pg||
nt|psyck:  if so W knows two key cards missing|pg||
nt|ady: neither works|pg||
nt|psyck:  Running Scores: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||

pc|c4|nt|bg: GM all good save in 5 clubs 4 hearts max for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the good thing for NS here is that North is on lead, so South won't be tempted to lead a fatal ace|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: I am told yes to my earlier question of 3rd pair by knowledgable specs|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kerasidis: :) good to have nice company:)|pg||
nt|ady: possible slam in hearts again     again fails|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  I all|pg||
nt|rv: classical 2n opening, rare to see nowadays in the age of multi and other multi meaning 1@c openings|pg||
mb|3N|nt|penseur9:  Sorry for the delay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a thin responsive double, but reasonable with four hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: VAL DI MAGRA Team: CAITI Stefano - COLOTTO Giuseppe - LANZAROTTI Massimo - MANNO Andrea - PATANE' Rosario - PATTACINI Maurizio - POCHINI Claudio - ZAFFINO Maurizio|pg||

pc|h7|nt|penseur9:  Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Andre|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Hope everyone knows we have voice commentary as well, just press the play button next to each name in the bottom right corner |pg||
nt|penseur9:  Hi Oosmarb|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But you need to use the web client through  www.bridgebase.com  to get voice|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: against the odds slam   around 37 percent|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is rather familiar|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: maximum and hearts|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|bg: good pass by N 2 H about limit with this distribution|pg||
nt|rv: even if declarer plays @C to @CK, Versace has only 8 tricks with @s suit not breaking beningly|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  This seems easy enough with @D breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  The system we think N-S play, more or less|pg||
nt|psyck:  this time they mey decide staying out with 2 key cards missing is a good idea after all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: they should locate 2 key cards missing|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ugis: so Monaco has striked back - good news for the spectators (sorry Luxembourg :))|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia in the other semi has extended the lead and thus look strong contenders for the final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: identical bidding so far!|pg||
nt|psyck:  they are checking the back of the cards|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: well, if the defence switches to diamonds declarer may get locked in hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Actually dummy is blocked!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but that is not exactly easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still if there is one West who could find that defence, it is this one |pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Will probably be able to use defenders as stepping stone|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: however, East has no keys, so we should not see 4NT|pg||
nt|psyck:  5@c 03 this time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West knows two keys are missing now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: although it has to be the @DJ, otherwise the @D9 is a dummy entry|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rv: he has stolen !trick he desired, not enough though|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: gosh, this is complex|pg||
nt|penseur9:  very|pg||
nt|penseur9:  @S seems the best hope|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: dont seems to want to use rkc so they can avoid getting too high   though of course some days 6@H will make|pg||
nt|psyck:  W praying this wont be raised|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ugis: looks like -1 here and a push|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: it is more efficient, if hearts are trumps, to use 4@s as the keycard ask rather than 4NT|pg||
nt|ady: now praying K@H wrong|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: apparnetly 4@S was their rkc on this sequence|pg||
pc|d3|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ugis: sorry 3 imps to Lux|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kerasidis: there is always a question about thiese hands ...whether to rebid a 4 card suit or the 6 card|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: when in doubt - run the long suit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rv: excellent technique by Versace, playing for small extra chance of @SJ doubleton before trying for 3-3 break|pg||
nt|psyck:  now trying for some blockage & endplay|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: apparently|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: interesting if West leads a low spade at trick 2 and East ducks the 9 or J  |pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, declarer could hardly have Axx of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpn: made 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|pelu: but it has been 10 hards days for the young players|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: pretty strong for Multi, even at these colors, but as i mentioned earlier, the national tendency in france is to be solid|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of play - and prob some party'es :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|pelu: I would also open 2@D :):)|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: even within the context of French standards, 2D is marginal I think because of the playability in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: obviously a style thing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: here all roads lead to 4S, though the D lead would probably be somewhat harder to read had the opening bid been 1H|pg||
nt|pelu: to day - spec in Europe - a lot of playeres know very well how to defend against Multi, so there are "many" who play Multi a little more contructiv that before |pg||
nt|marlowepi: here declarer can afford to suffer a ruff and it might well simplify the play for him by drawing a half-round of trumps:)|pg||

nt|hedyg:  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|psyck:  may start at 5 level|pg||
nt|rv: N-S have an excellent save of upto 6@s |pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: 3NT by north    or 4@H makes |pg||
nt|rv: 3@d seems to be some variant of bergen raise|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rv: I suspect N-S may buy hand in 5@s after this start to auction|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: I'm told West returned a heart|pg||
nt|psyck:  Versace did not want to bid 1st round with unpassed pd & unfav vul|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play double of 4@d here by North to show extras, double of cue bid below game level has diff meaning of cue bid above 4 level|pg||
nt|psyck:  NS fining the  double fit will help them save at appropriate level|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eweber: NS is playing a variable club system (Swedish style), 1@d shows 11-15 unbal with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c=FG with clubs or balanced or heart support|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski intends to show no wastage in @s  and plenty of working cards with his 4@s bid|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ugis: auction in open room was simple 1-2-4|pg||
nt|bg: non vul with N hand should be preempting  and now S will not allow EW to play a vul game|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mdgraham: 2@d=5+ hearts|pg||
nt|rv: great bidding so far|pg||
nt|psyck:  it sure helped W find the bid, whether to make or sac, it works|pg||
nt|psyck:  NS will take insurance at this vul i suppose|pg||
mb|d|nt|ugis: I would certainly bid 3s like W did here|pg||
nt|bg: oops error in judgement by NS|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs, N-S better advised to take insurance though North might fancy his chances to defend this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|kerasidis: what 3@c meant?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  2@d=4S, 11+ HCP, not yet GF|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|psyck:  2N = GF relay, was 3424 12, 2344 18, 4234 15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no sorry, can't read. 2@d shows spades|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck:  3C = 4S-5H, 15+, sing. C|pg||
nt|rv: North might feel one of his rounded suits could fetch here though East's 4@s should have warned him|pg||
nt|psyck:  S should have bid 5@h instead of 5@s, that would have made the decision easier|pg||
nt|rv: now Versace in hot seat, will he get @c suit right?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck:  3D = relay|pg||

pc|s9|nt|kerasidis: weak clubs? hiding the dia fit|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck:  Though their 1 level openings are generally 14+, 1@h can be 11 + when with 4 @s's|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|bg: 3 clubs should be a fit showing jump  weak|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: looks kije 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: he might just play North for 5-5-1-2 and play for @CK doubleton inside|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oosmanb:  Unlucky board for Allegra, 4@H seems like a decent contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6 imps back to Allegra|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry all, a bit of trouble here... all OK now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck:  yes, that looks more likely due to the 4@h bid, but N may not have doubled with that shape|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Good morning all. Sorry I'm late|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|psyck:  gm Mike|pg||
nt|rv: Versace can play a) @CK doubleton with North b) @CKTX with North c) @CKXX with North and @CTX with South|pg||
nt|rv: gm Mike|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: typical Bergen would be 7-9, but the shape is good |pg||

nt|eweber: well, I learned that they play a strong club sys, but for the XX we can only assume that it might show a half stopper|pg||
nt|rv: though Allegra lost 7 IMPs on deal 3, they had outbid their opps and would have scored plenty of IMPs if @CK was South or if @CKTX was with North|pg||

nt|rv: will Zaleski double this to show major?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: Versace might just bid 3@s here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: over this kind of transfer. North has two bids available. He can bid either 3@c or 3@d, so some pairs use them to distinguish the kind of minor suit fit|pg||
nt|rv: if Zaleski had acted on 1n, E-W might have got to game, here I suspect they will stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: Pattacini's 1n opening might just have worked here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oosmanb:  I mightve bid 4@d as North here, nothing to be ashamed about in that hand (except perhaps @S quality)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: NS play a variable club system (Sedish style), 2@d promises 55|pg||
nt|eweber: of course South can reach N with @s then|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eweber: 2@c was sort of transfer|pg||

nt|rv: again winning decision by Versace, I might have just bid 3@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  the 3rd @h would work if he guesses|pg||

nt|rv: I would double 3@h as well|pg||
nt|psyck:  3 is more of a problem, but with perfect hape, matx values, intermediary cards, x of 2@h was standout|pg||

nt|kerasidis: most likely 8-11 or 14+ (12-13 would be 2NT), i am told|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: ultra modern opening, ZAR point or any other hand eval system will insist you open|pg||

mb|3C|an|!h + !d|nt|ady: poor suit   and poor shape |pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, sensible pass |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: if playing classical Bergen, 3@d=9-11 with 4-card support. very maximum here with five trumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: at least East didn't pass 4@c - he has learned his lesson|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm no 4@h cue|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: West will surely bid the slam now|pg||
nt|rv: we have ask Roland who is invisible, I don't know their sys well enough:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  SLAVINSKY LEADS:|pg||
nt|psyck:  When we have one or more honours we lead in direct counting: small with an odd number of cards, high with an even number of cards.|pg||
nt|psyck:  When we have no honours we lead in reverse counting: small with an even number of cards, high with an odd number of cards.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: because you could play it as a transfer to 3@H and folow up with 3NT - but that means East declares 3NT if that is the final contract|pg||
nt|psyck:  Roland is doing voice commentary, you can see  him is using the browser|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|penseur9:  will the hand play different from E vs W in open room|pg||
nt|psyck:  10 is not considered an honour but with 10x we lead with 10.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a diamond lead beats it, of course, but how can South lead that? |pg||
nt|psyck:  3@d on 2@d would be 5@s & 4@h|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: not the best switch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they have got both 3NT and 4@h declared by West, so all is well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eweber: as cards lie 3NT is unbeatable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it would be interesting to see the results of a computer simulation of 2@S by North- what the percentages are |pg||
nt|psyck:  That is NS carding style...|pg||

nt|reisig: Maybe X...or Pass|pg||
nt|ady: best to forget the diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck:  now everyone wants to do something, just don't know what|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@c possible|pg||
nt|ady: naybe 2NT   clubs or diamonds?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: although with three smnall spades and two small hearts, colour me chicken|pg||
nt|psyck:  will S try looking for 3rd round control in @c?|pg||
nt|rv: South could have splintered with 3@s, then on 4@d can blackwood though all roads lead to GS|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@c is 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced. Not sure what the double implies|pg||
nt|psyck:  6@c after RKC response may ask for 3rd round control...|pg||
nt|rv: South's worry for GS will be North holding 3rd round control of @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 5@D now to check on @hQ|pg||
nt|rv: South still needs to find out both @HQ as well as 3rd control @c control, maybe he will chance GS even w/o explicit 3rd round control|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that 6@H jump probably denies any side king|pg||
nt|rv: as a few knowledgable specs point if North showed @HQ with 5n, then South could have still bid 6@c|pg||
nt|psyck:  S will have to gamble on 3rd round @c control now|pg||
nt|rv: some play 5n response to queen ask to show 2 side kings and @HQ|pg||
nt|psyck:  5N would be showing trump Q & unshowable K's for some|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, more efficient to use 5N as showing the queen|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck:  likely the unbalanced variation as N chose 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  either unshowable or 2|pg||
