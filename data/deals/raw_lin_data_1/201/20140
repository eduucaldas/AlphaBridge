mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eweber: what a hand to start with!|pg||
nt|rv: E-W should score this comfortably, @c strain might have fetched 10 tricks though|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  predictable contract   but wont make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, West will enquire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's obvious now that East has hearts - it's the only suit he hasn't bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: told 3@c maximum, 3@s=hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: E-W should compete to 3@c here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck:  They bid that way to right side |pg||
nt|psyck:  good lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  Hi Andy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck:  could well go overboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think soemone had better bid hearts soon|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: defence seems to have five tricks in clear view - two spades, two diamonds and a club |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as usual, when you lead fro KQ10, dummy has the jack and declarer the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, I was going to try my first voice, but somehow I don't seem to be accepted|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rv: Guisy, is Allegra a full 6 member team with Sementa and Duboin 3rd pair sitting out this segment?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eweber: at the other table East has jumped to 4@c over an art. 1@c opening|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|psyck:  wonder if 4@s was kickback|pg||
nt|ady: looks to to be only 7 tricks   2 diamonds   3 hearts 1 club  and 1 further black suit trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like two spades, a club and a diamond to lose at first sight|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Krishna|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  tricky defence required to beat this?|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, @d switch needed|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can count up to 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|psyck:  & @h will be entry to cash @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bill|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|queequeg: welcome to Ugins Jansons :)|pg||
nt|ady: slam  can be played 2 ways   ruffing finesse of KQ@C    or  a squeeze on south if south has A@C   and Q@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it, 4NT=1 key|pg||
nt|psyck:  if so W knows two key cards missing|pg||
nt|ady: neither works|pg||
nt|psyck:  Running Scores: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eweber: ending up with North bidding and playing 4@h |pg||
nt|ady: ruffing finesse best odds|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|queequeg: Ugis|pg||
nt|ugis: hello everyone|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck:  E got tempted by the void|pg||
nt|psyck:  def has easy road to 5 tricks now|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ugis: well done NS - they have reached a top spot on this deal|pg||
nt|psyck:  more or less needs @cA right|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  West has to duck this ... then the switch|pg||
nt|andyv:  K@h overtake Q@s and play 10@h|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bg: GM all good save in 5 clubs 4 hearts max for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the good thing for NS here is that North is on lead, so South won't be tempted to lead a fatal ace|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: I am told yes to my earlier question of 3rd pair by knowledgable specs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg:  http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Wayne Stuart|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi everyone.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: 9@C   Lauria duck|pg||
nt|psyck:  we still have lesser specs here than other room, the kibs are pampered by getting to watch Papi daily on BBO anyway|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: now should cash out for down 2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kerasidis: hi all!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||

nt|andyv:  cash out time for down 1|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck:  * or some squeeze|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck:  Sementa-Duboin the 3rd pair|pg||
nt|psyck:  they palyed yesterday in the match shown on vu gr|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: squeeze on south looks best now  but wont work|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|nt|bjacobs:  Nunes forlornly hoped for 3-3 diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  hoping for @ds to split|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2:  Audio through the web client at  www.bridgebase.com    maybe CK can explain the procedure|pg||

mb|p|nt|queequeg: welcome to Dennis Kerasidis :)|pg||
nt|bg: Hi Dennis|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: fortunate lay  for 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: :) good to have nice company:)|pg||
nt|ady: possible slam in hearts again     again fails|pg||
mb|2C|nt|penseur9:  I all|pg||
nt|rv: classical 2n opening, rare to see nowadays in the age of multi and other multi meaning 1@c openings|pg||
nt|penseur9: test|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  Sorry for the delay|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck:  cheap contract|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: clubs play for 6 winners so defence dont get therir spade trick   also diamonds 3-2|pg||
nt|penseur9: I expected them tobe in NT|pg||
nt|psyck:  some would bid 1N as E at this vul|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: a thin responsive double, but reasonable with four hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: VAL DI MAGRA Team: CAITI Stefano - COLOTTO Giuseppe - LANZAROTTI Massimo - MANNO Andrea - PATANE' Rosario - PATTACINI Maurizio - POCHINI Claudio - ZAFFINO Maurizio|pg||
nt|rv: Pattacini unlikely to find @DA lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: ALLEGRA Team: BOCCHI Norberto - DUBOIN Giorgio - GIUBILO Valerio - LAURIA Lorenzo - MADALA Agustin - SEMENTA Antonio - VERSACE Alfredo - ZALESKI Roman|pg||
nt|rv: ty Guisy|pg||
nt|psyck:  but a poor idea when both opps are passed|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c game forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Andre|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Hope everyone knows we have voice commentary as well, just press the play button next to each name in the bottom right corner |pg||
nt|penseur9:  Hi Oosmarb|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But you need to use the web client through  www.bridgebase.com  to get voice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: against the odds slam   around 37 percent|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is rather familiar|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maximum and hearts|pg||
nt|ady: a chance to catch up  if they can find the slam   though would be lucky|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bg: good pass by N 2 H about limit with this distribution|pg||
nt|rv: even if declarer plays @C to @CK, Versace has only 8 tricks with @s suit not breaking beningly|pg||
pc|hK|nt|penseur9: this should not cause any problem for declairer|pg||
nt|penseur9: good point CK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  This seems easy enough with @D breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  The system we think N-S play, more or less|pg||
nt|psyck:  this time they mey decide staying out with 2 key cards missing is a good idea after all|pg||
nt|wstuart: As a passed hand, with the opponents not competing, it is very likely that opener has a very good hand, so passing in this situation is quite reasonable.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Interestingly, had west opened in first seat, bidding 1NT with east has much more going for it.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: they should locate 2 key cards missing|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s obviously didn't show @s....maybe showed short @s|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ugis: so Monaco has striked back - good news for the spectators (sorry Luxembourg :))|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia in the other semi has extended the lead and thus look strong contenders for the final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: identical bidding so far!|pg||
nt|psyck:  they are checking the back of the cards|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Wayne, welcome|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi Andre|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: well, if the defence switches to diamonds declarer may get locked in hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Actually dummy is blocked!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but that is not exactly easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still if there is one West who could find that defence, it is this one |pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Will probably be able to use defenders as stepping stone|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: however, East has no keys, so we should not see 4NT|pg||
nt|psyck:  5@c 03 this time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West knows two keys are missing now|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although it has to be the @DJ, otherwise the @D9 is a dummy entry|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure declarer is happy at the moment not being in 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play 5-card majors, so the @S9 is known to be a singleton  |pg||
nt|psyck:  now comfortable|pg||
nt|psyck:  Nunes neeeded to paly @dA 1st round|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: he has stolen !trick he desired, not enough though|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: gosh, this is complex|pg||
nt|penseur9:  very|pg||
nt|penseur9:  @S seems the best hope|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: dont seems to want to use rkc so they can avoid getting too high   though of course some days 6@H will make|pg||
nt|psyck:  W praying this wont be raised|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|ugis: looks like -1 here and a push|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: it is more efficient, if hearts are trumps, to use 4@s as the keycard ask rather than 4NT|pg||
nt|ady: now praying K@H wrong|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  Nunes not ready for the @d back|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: I suspect N-S may buy hand in 5@s after this start to auction|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: I'm told West returned a heart|pg||
nt|psyck:  Versace did not want to bid 1st round with unpassed pd & unfav vul|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play double of 4@d here by North to show extras, double of cue bid below game level has diff meaning of cue bid above 4 level|pg||
nt|psyck:  NS fining the  double fit will help them save at appropriate level|pg||
nt|ady: most would open north hand|pg||
nt|ady: in spite  of their 10 card club fit   only 7 tricks for n/s in clubs|pg||
nt|psyck:  you can click on http://www.bridgebase.com/client/client.php and open any number of windows to browse multiple tables (select look around the site & you can log in anonymously)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: NS is playing a variable club system (Swedish style), 1@d shows 11-15 unbal with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c=FG with clubs or balanced or heart support|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski intends to show no wastage in @s  and plenty of working cards with his 4@s bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=10+-14 for NS|pg||
nt|psyck:  you can also listen to the voice commentaary in this room, only via the browser link|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ugis: auction in open room was simple 1-2-4|pg||
nt|bg: non vul with N hand should be preempting  and now S will not allow EW to play a vul game|pg||
nt|wstuart: I wonder if 4@H would be a splinter at this point?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@d=5+ hearts|pg||
nt|rv: great bidding so far|pg||
nt|psyck:  it sure helped W find the bid, whether to make or sac, it works|pg||
nt|psyck:  NS will take insurance at this vul i suppose|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ugis: I would certainly bid 3s like W did here|pg||
nt|bg: oops error in judgement by NS|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs, N-S better advised to take insurance though North might fancy his chances to defend this|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not too many problems on this one.|pg||
nt|andyv:  on 18, Nunes had to win A@d and lead @h back, perserving the K@d as entry to the @hs in E hand|pg||

nt|kerasidis: what 3@c meant?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  2@d=4S, 11+ HCP, not yet GF|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|psyck:  2N = GF relay, was 3424 12, 2344 18, 4234 15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no sorry, can't read. 2@d shows spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  not an easy hand to play|pg||
nt|psyck:  nor to bid, not sure what the bids mean here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck:  3C = 4S-5H, 15+, sing. C|pg||
nt|rv: North might feel one of his rounded suits could fetch here though East's 4@s should have warned him|pg||
nt|psyck:  S should have bid 5@h instead of 5@s, that would have made the decision easier|pg||
nt|rv: now Versace in hot seat, will he get @c suit right?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 12-14; maybe they don't play the full Nightmare system |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 2@c was stuck for bid over 1@s and 2@d was checkback|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck:  3D = relay|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|psyck:  they must have changed the 3@c meaning|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and maybe it has changed since 2005.....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kerasidis: weak clubs? hiding the dia fit|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a nice lay for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  and on 18, W did go up with the A@d and 12 more imps to Allegra team|pg||
nt|psyck:  i'd guess 2@c probably a variety of hands & 2@d asked|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck:  Though their 1 level openings are generally 14+, 1@h can be 11 + when with 4 @s's|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|bg: 3 clubs should be a fit showing jump  weak|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: looks kije 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: he might just play North for 5-5-1-2 and play for @CK doubleton inside|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec believes 2@c asked p to bid 2@d and then 2@h showed 4@h|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oosmanb:  Unlucky board for Allegra, 4@H seems like a decent contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6 imps back to Allegra|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry all, a bit of trouble here... all OK now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck:  yes, that looks more likely due to the 4@h bid, but N may not have doubled with that shape|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Good morning all. Sorry I'm late|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|psyck:  gm Mike|pg||
nt|rv: Versace can play a) @CK doubleton with North b) @CKTX with North c) @CKXX with North and @CTX with South|pg||
nt|rv: gm Mike|pg||
nt|rv: only c) works here, I suspect he will play for a) or b) if he can smoke out distribution|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

nt|psyck:  defense will have to help a bit, but likely down as cards are anyway|pg||
nt|psyck:  i'd assume he will take the fin if @d played now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if E shows the AK of @h, the hand will be easy for N to play|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|bg: surprised that S passed 4 hearts|pg||

nt|ady: good heart fit    but cards lay badly for n/s|pg||
nt|psyck:  few would chose 2@c at this vul with that hand indeed|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2@S= minors I guess|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@s a version of unusual over unusual|pg||
nt|psyck:  showing a good raise for pd here|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@S likely a limit raise or LR+ in @C.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  I think something happened with the replay...end position could not have been as shown|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: interesting board|pg||
nt|penseur9: could EW get too high here?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eweber: 3@c from West looks as if 2NT was kind of Lebensohl|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9:  3@C seems indicate 0-7 with 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm told they are in 6@h on 18 next door|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: e/w overboard now |pg||
nt|wstuart: Should have an easy 10 tricks on a @S lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is too good for a Roland slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: NS play neg. lead directing doubles from 3level if I remember their sys correctly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  3@C I meant|pg||
nt|elbec: nice choice by S who decided to pass|pg||
mb|4D|nt|psyck:  as the cards are both 4@s & 3N make|pg||
nt|psyck:  3N superior of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: typical Bergen would be 7-9, but the shape is good |pg||
nt|psyck:  3H = 5+H GF, 1-suiter or 4S-5H (was 4522 12, 2812 13, 3532 16)|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@d was no major|pg||
nt|rv: both pointed suits break beningly here, 4@s is a easy make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: being careful with 5332 is a good adjustment for "the law"|pg||
nt|ady: as long as n/s find the diamond ruff  then down 1|pg||
nt|elbec: @d lead would have easily defeated this. let's see versace's play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if West bid bid 4@c, and it was passed out, then one can safely say that a misunderstanding has occurred  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot of players use Smolen here - not NS, obviously|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't see on NS card what 3@s is...looks like unspecified splinter perhaps|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|eweber: anyone here who knows the EW system?|pg||
nt|eweber: well, I learned that they play a strong club sys, but for the XX we can only assume that it might show a half stopper|pg||
nt|rv: though Allegra lost 7 IMPs on deal 3, they had outbid their opps and would have scored plenty of IMPs if @CK was South or if @CKTX was with North|pg||
nt|andyv:  so obviously 3@s is some type of slam try...either cue bid in @s or some shortness|pg||
mb|5N|nt|mdgraham: Smolen would be 3@s by South to show 4@S5@h |pg||
nt|psyck:  4@d cue with fit|pg||
nt|ady: south might be worried about a club ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently they use Reverse Smolen, as they play weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: however on the lay will not have much difficulty  which ever line taken|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: i would not pass east's hand |pg||
nt|eweber: hi Bruce, hi Denis, knowing the NS pair quite well and having their system file in front of me, I join in for the purpose of answering system questions|pg||
nt|eweber: hi all|pg||
mb|6C|nt|penseur9: I guess 6@H is cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  @s for 1 loser & @h for no loser, a 67% slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would imagine the 4@s, if not kickback, would show some type of @c control|pg||
mb|6H|nt|kerasidis: hi elke :) thank you!|pg||
nt|penseur9: 3NT should make on any lead with extra tricks possible depending on play|pg||
nt|penseur9: somebody suggest that their are only 8 tricks: not really.. 5C 2D 1H 1S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, that won't cause too many problems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: In fact, after a @S now and a @H shift by N, west will have to misguess @H not to take 10 tricks anyway.  However, he may misguess @H given the bidding.|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like leading twice toward the AQ10 of @s would be the percentage play|pg||
nt|psyck:  the double fin with low to @st the % play in @s for 1 loser|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  I'm pretty sure 4@s was kickback and 5@d showed 2 keys|pg||

nt|mdgraham: North couild have helped his partner on lead by doubling the 4@s cue bid|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rv: Versace might just bid 3@s here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: over this kind of transfer. North has two bids available. He can bid either 3@c or 3@d, so some pairs use them to distinguish the kind of minor suit fit|pg||
nt|rv: if Zaleski had acted on 1n, E-W might have got to game, here I suspect they will stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: Pattacini's 1n opening might just have worked here|pg||
nt|elbec: NS open 1@d with 4@d and 5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but fairly normal to lead your own suit after the 3@C support raise  |pg||
nt|psyck:  4@h rather, as 4@s has danger of @h ruff|pg||
nt|wstuart: They may well play 4@H.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oosmanb:  I mightve bid 4@d as North here, nothing to be ashamed about in that hand (except perhaps @S quality)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: NS play a variable club system (Sedish style), 2@d promises 55|pg||
nt|eweber: of course South can reach N with @s then|pg||

mb|p|nt|eweber: 2@c was sort of transfer|pg||
nt|psyck:  no entry to hand for @s finesse|pg||
nt|rv: again winning decision by Versace, I might have just bid 3@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  the 3rd @h would work if he guesses|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if East might have bid directly over 1NT, rather than waiting until the bidding got to the three level?|pg||
nt|andyv:  only question is 4@s or 3N?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ugis: should go -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: take the cash|pg||
nt|psyck:  but he has lesses @d than @h & may misguess like other room|pg||

nt|ady: west does not like defending|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he will be disappointed to see @hAJxxx in dummy|pg||

nt|ady: how many spades    4 likely|pg||

nt|ady: no doubet west will be there with the long spades|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  transfer?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the cards lie rather badly for EW here|pg||
nt|psyck:  couln;t lie better for NS though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS can make 6@C double dummy :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes   down 2 in 4@S  in spite of the great fit|pg||
nt|ady: north double|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show two places to play, not necessarily minors|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes woth a small slam now NS|pg||
nt|wstuart: How could there ever be a swing on a deal with an 8 card suit present?  lol|pg||
nt|psyck:  :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ugis: rdbl?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 6@H too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will East double.... |pg||
nt|rv: he will surely double with perfect shape and passed hand|pg||
nt|rv: partner can't misconstrue (play him for more)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, he is taking his time about it|pg||
nt|rv: E-W can score upto 11 tricks in @ds, even 3n could make unless defended very accurately|pg||
nt|mdgraham: are they using screens?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently so - thanks Roland|pg||
nt|rv: w/o @c lead, E-W can even make 6@d since @HA comes down in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|ady: south 5@C?|pg||
nt|rv: ah ok, 8 member team allowed|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 2@h transfer|pg||
nt|psyck:  no no losing option for NS|pg||
nt|psyck:  *now no...|pg||
nt|psyck:  choice of ways for a good score, x or bid slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect someone will double this|pg||
nt|psyck:  what do you bid as W on the x?|pg||
nt|psyck:  S will be happy with opps having values in his short suit & pd showing good hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ugis: ns might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good point Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: very surprising he passed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT would be nice, except that a lot of pairs play some Lebensohl-like device after the double |pg||
nt|psyck:  5@c timid there|pg||
nt|psyck:  but not clear what else he courld do|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's going to be very hard for North to bid a slam now.|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|psyck:  yes, I was sure of an x there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: note that East doubled 3@h at the other table!|pg||
nt|psyck:  2N nat would be nice, but surely hardly anyone plays it that way nowadays|pg||
nt|rv: I would double 3@h as well|pg||
nt|psyck:  3 is more of a problem, but with perfect hape, matx values, intermediary cards, x of 2@h was standout|pg||
nt|rv: to CK's question, I play modified lebensohl here from West hand on East's double (even if passed hand)|pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays  going down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c=GF balanced or with @cs|pg||
nt|rv: we do have Voice commentary here, Roland and team in action|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: here, double by lauria does not mean " they are cooked", it rather means " pard, i d like to go to 5@s, what do you think?"|pg||
nt|ady: dbl seems odd    when  east is on lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe he is planning to lead a cunning @S9|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs  to unblock|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh wow|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   not neccessary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if he had doubled, we might be watching a contract of 2@hx - West has good trumps for a pass |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C was the making contract for n/s if west does not find A@H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: dbl with N cards surely not everybodies choice, but he was lucky not to be punished|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i am curius about the range of the 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: poor east   all the aces and kings running away|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C looks optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  Maybe Fantunes have some systemic gadget to do better here|pg||
nt|andyv:  good bidding into an easy contract|pg||

nt|mdgraham: doubling after 2@h-4@H, I mean|pg||
nt|rv: yes, CK|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H was aloud to make on hand 21 by e/w|pg||
nt|rv: Bochhi is conserving his energy for more difficult hands|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: well played, That'll teach East to open a strong NT  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: another slam    best played bu Fantoni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree. You don't wan't to punish partner for enterprise in getting your side involved  |pg||
nt|psyck:  sure, normal to play 3@d with passed pd|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski may get another opportunity to balance here, Pattacini would do well to raise to 3@s (tactical)|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for 3@s here with North hand?|pg||
nt|psyck:  I don't think 4@d pass would have been forcing|pg||
nt|penseur9: their will be much water under the bridge all 6 rounds of 16 boards are played out|pg||
nt|wstuart: You would have to be very confident that it was forcing. |pg||
nt|penseur9: *after all 16...|pg||
nt|rv: in my view a good strategy playing long matches|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: 3NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D=18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  Strand preemptive style other room, 3@h last deal & Madala passed this hand opened 2@s here|pg||
nt|psyck:  *strange|pg||
nt|ritong: amusing hand for the convention|pg||
nt|ritong: from lauria's point of view|pg||
nt|elbec: how many of the kibitzers could reach 2@d contract with EW cards? :)|pg||
nt|ady: great lay here  e/w can make 3NT   but wont be in it|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   only 8 tricks|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eweber: 2@s showed a good wk2 if I remeber correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  yes, nearly cold by North|pg||

mb|2D|nt|penseur9:  maybe 2NT-p-3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry to slow :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: the 180 in board 4 was topped by all other tables, many downs in all EW contracts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I like 3NT directly|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is ubiquitous Gazzilli|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|eweber: maybe they changed this part of the sys or my memory is not good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I feel sorry for East. You pick up a strong notrump and score -1310, and then you pick up a Yarborough  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s by North?|pg||
nt|rv: either 5@h+4+@c 11+ or 17+any hand?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ugis: temting for S to go on|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful little dummy|pg||
nt|penseur9: this should be +1 while it seems that 4@S may have had a chance NS|pg||
nt|penseur9: sorry meant 4@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - but you'd be pretty certain to get the trumps wrong|pg||
nt|penseur9: good point Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless you could get some sort of count on the West hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|penseur9: I guess EW 1NT is 15-17 points|pg||
nt|rv: stronger variety is 16+any hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this could upto 3 down,E-W were making 4@h though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is an old joke - what do you call AKQJxxx? Trumps  |pg||
nt|cuan: what a reopening by Manno !!!|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, was a virile reaction imo|pg||
nt|ritong: "you won t get me" he said|pg||
nt|elbec: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|psyck:  other room on the way to slam last deal|pg||
nt|penseur9: that would create a swing :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  after same bidding until 5@c...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck:  N wishing he had tried 3@s instead of 3@c|pg||
nt|rv: if North's 3@s was non-forcing, Versace might have been tempted to double 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: easy to double this sitting here, far too difficult at the table:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: This wil prove to be an expensive lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  Odds of yarborough (no card higher than 9) 1:1827|pg||
nt|psyck:  if 4N is Turbo, S showed even key cards|pg||
nt|ady: best is 6NT  from north side   which can make if diamonds dont split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed - why, the opposition might even have their bids!|pg||
nt|rv: Versace will shift to @c here and not commit on defsne|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: anyone for a spade lead?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9: on  6 theOR was also in 5@C but doubled for another 7 IMPs for Allegra|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ugis: a chance now :)|pg||
nt|ugis: J of spades :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: old joke - if I'd bid diamonds, would you lead spades.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 21 Garozzo made 4@sx. Club king overtaken by the ace for a diamond switch, but now there was a ruffing club finesse |pg||
nt|rv: I presume 2n showed 5@h+4m limited range, 3@c could be relay, 3@h showed 4@d, I am guessing here:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ugis: if E plays low...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with 1065 in spades, i'd need a good reason not to lead them - like AKQJX in hearts, perhaps  |pg||
nt|rv: I presume East has indicated no interest in @ds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and Garozzo wasn't going to get the hearts wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h switch?|pg||
nt|andyv:  should break communication to dummy now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: @CT followed by @C3|pg||
nt|penseur9: both down 2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: now @d shift for even 4 down|pg||
nt|rv: great trust in partner's carding|pg||
nt|rv: no wonder Versace is amongst top 5 players as per WBF rankings:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|iceking: 100% hann verður bestur ef hann kemur hausnum í lag hafa menn ekkert verið að fylgjast með honum þarf bara koma hausnum í lag tekur tíma þegar það gerist búmm dominerar aftur|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: so did versace, and EW won the "who pushes who" streetfight|pg||
nt|ady: should be flat    down 1 |pg||
nt|wstuart: With an impending red suit endplay on east, 9 tricks are likely now.|pg||
nt|rv: in classicial Gazzilli, 2n used to show 5@h+4@c 15-17, Madala-Bocchi are playing modified Gazzilli|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kerasidis: spades blocked|pg||
nt|penseur9:  he has to play @S now|pg||
nt|rv: good def to prevent any squeeze possibility, declarer had only 8 tricks since @cs don't break|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bg: better discard heart or down 3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT would have made, so this is about par for the course |pg||
nt|ritong: naturally, 2NT implied double @s stopper and @d fit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|psyck:  yeah, dec needed @c9 & 8 to be switch to have a chance there|pg||
nt|andyv:  S may try to cash 2 rounds of @d, one more round of @hs and throw E in with a @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will be exit with a @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  the other line of play is to exit a @s|pg||
nt|rv: with @CT set-up, defense needs only 2@s tricks to beat contract if they get red suit trick|pg||
nt|rv: best is @s exit here|pg||
nt|andyv:  right....there doesn't appear to be any line that work|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: NS are having a decent little run here |pg||
nt|psyck:  E does not want to let go of his lovely @s's|pg||
nt|wstuart: My guess is that he will finesse the @DQ now, win the @C return, play the @DA hoping to find the @DJ doubleton, cash a high @H, then exit with teh @DT and hope for the endplay, ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: which will work.|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam bid and nade in OR on  6 for 11 IMPs for Angelini team|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck:  missed one trick of @d ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: North: oh, you have some spades, partner?|pg||

nt|psyck:  it should work as Wayne mentioned|pg||
nt|penseur9: seems I'm wrong sorry|pg||
nt|wstuart: east knows he is toast here -  the hand is a readout after North showed a singleton @S.|pg||
nt|psyck:  well, he could get everything wrong & try to drop cards, but everyone would put their money on Lauria making here :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I was thinking of a club return here|pg||
nt|wstuart: he's got to play west for the @HJ or it's all over|pg||
nt|wstuart: but there is no escape.|pg||
nt|psyck:  W knows declarers shape & values & knows he is in a hopeless position|pg||
nt|wstuart: he won't go wrong.  the chances of doubleton @HQ are *mush* smaller than finding the @DJ having to give him a @H hook.|pg||
nt|psyck:  *E knows|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes, You wouldn't open 2@D to say, I have 18-19 balanced, and then 2NT to say, Did you hear me, partner? I have 18-19 balanced. There has to be a good reason to bid 2NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  overcalling|pg||

pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: 5@C presumably pass/correct|pg||

nt|henryb:  If @c aren't 3-0, the hand is cold. If E has the 3, you will find out. and if West has the 3, you need to unblock the 8 so that you can win a second @c cheaply in the S hand|pg||

nt|psyck:  When we have no honours we lead in reverse counting: small with an even number of cards, high with an odd number of cards.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: because you could play it as a transfer to 3@H and folow up with 3NT - but that means East declares 3NT if that is the final contract|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: a diamond lead beats it, of course, but how can South lead that? |pg||
nt|psyck:  3@d on 2@d would be 5@s & 4@h|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: not the best switch|pg||

nt|wstuart: I'm a bit surprised at teh 2@C opening.  Not only is this a difficult pattern to bid out after 2@C, but it will be even more vulnerable to preemption.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: 3 nt for ew|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  sacrifice to much|pg||
nt|rv: y CK, A in longer suit better|pg||
nt|rv: 3@c by Madala is mixed raise|pg||
nt|psyck:  takes the 1 level away from opps|pg||
nt|psyck:  jump cues often played as mixed raise in competition|pg||
nt|rv: many folks play cue (good 10+) to show good raise and jump cue to show mixed raise (6-8)|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's what it looks like here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: Zaleski thinking of correcting 2@h to 3@c here?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which might be rather difficult to manage now|pg||
nt|wstuart: Preemption either by the opps or by pard, as in this case.  ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: W can pass|pg||
nt|penseur9: how high will EW go?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|eweber: board 22 might cost some imps but as board 21 was duplicated in the closed room, I assume this match is over|pg||
nt|queequeg: next match will be Reggio Emilia - Angelini|pg||
nt|psyck:  2 suiter are tough to handle after 2@c, but this is too strong to try anything else maybhe|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|rv: @c lead best here|pg||
nt|ady: the transfer response works agains n/s here   |pg||
nt|psyck:  i assume S showed red suits, & this is pick a slam|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't know - the @DQ is a pretty weak card a priori.  If you get past the natural 1@C opening, you have a very easy road to showing both strength and pattern.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|rv: Pattacini could have worked out to lead a trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 6NT by North ok too - also difficult to mange |pg||
nt|psyck:  wow, nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Not much to the play :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  maybe 3@s was just shortness, & 5N GSF|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mdgraham: might get out for two down - two club finesses|pg||
nt|queequeg: at 21.15 italian time, 15.15 EST|pg||
nt|rv: I can't see Versace scoring this, good switch|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is not a good grand, however it makes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: sry, lost connxtn|pg||
nt|wstuart: The odds are 52% for teh @D suit to come in for no losers, plus the small chance of an opening ruff.|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm sure any grand that makes is considered good... after the fact :)|pg||
nt|rv: I am told by knowledgable specs that Lauria recently O/Ced on KTXXX, XX, XX, XXXX White vs Red|pg||
nt|psyck:  overboard here with the @h break|pg||
mb|6H|nt|penseur9: welcome back :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suddenly got the White Screen of Death|pg||
nt|wstuart: The non-vul grand needs to be 56% to be break even.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: probably C!A and anothe?|pg||
nt|ritong: now versace has not led a @c yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: lots of messages that NS can still right-side a slam - 6@h|pg||
nt|ady: west does not have an automatic  club lead against a slam in spades|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think he will|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3@S was likely shortness?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  we are just guessing about the bidding|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: auction sounds like a @d lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  Particularly since Lauria did not double 4@c|pg||
nt|psyck:  may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
nt|rv: this is crazy auction, 3@h and 3n were non-forcing bids from both sides, now they are in slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  it seems E's 3N should have warned W to slow down|pg||
nt|rv: Nunes's 3@h and Fantoni's 3n both can't be forcing to the best of my knowledge|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 3N was a non serious slam try, the 4@c and 4@d were cue bids|pg||
nt|mathat: fantoni nows K @s is bad card|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: sorry, @CA and another|pg||
nt|penseur9: happens to me also from time to time|pg||
nt|penseur9: we have a tye... the 3NT frtom OR went down one for 12 IMPs toAllegra|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: does not want to give an imps   being somewaht behind|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|elbec: but remember: they are Lauria Versace :)|pg||
nt|ritong: well, a @c remains possible, but versace is not threatened by a long suit or something|pg||
nt|ritong: which would call for an aggressive move|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: this deal is not advert for lite openings|pg||
nt|rv: now @CT?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  since E showed the K@d, W's hand improved greatly but still he needed too many cover cards from E|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ugis: So it looks like we will see Estonia battle Luxembourg for the title|pg||
nt|eweber: 4@h counts 20 points more :)|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he goes for the mundane @d|pg||
nt|mathat: in 3 @h beter to bid 4|pg||
nt|psyck:  3N just to play in this seq likely|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|penseur9: *from...|pg||
nt|psyck:  they are not in G & trump not agreed yet, so it cannot be non serious|pg||
nt|rv: does 1@s double promise 4@h for Fantunes? I suspect 3n was to play and not non-serious slam try though their auction has little more merit if it was non-serious|pg||
nt|andyv:  in 3N was to play then EW were just not on same page|pg||
nt|psyck:  *in GF|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|elbec: 12 easy tricks for NS|pg||

nt|mdgraham: very shapely deal.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as you said, Venky, not an advert for light openings|pg||
nt|rv: 2 more segments after this rite?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and West gets another chance....|pg||
nt|psyck:  ye, today|pg||
nt|ady: very likely to be flat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another likely 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: ah, we may start having compairisons soon with or|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eweber: the last few boards have been what a team with a big lead must be wishing for: quite boring|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: amusing auction next door. Everybody bid suits they haven't got |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, the previous opening was AAK. |pg||
nt|rv: just 25 IMPs, still enough boards for Val Di Magra to turn this around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s?|pg||
nt|henryb:  If I thought I were well ahead, it would not occur to me to act with the E hand|pg||
nt|psyck:  not going well for Angelini this set at all, they are in 6@s other room here|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s could be @s+minor if it is popular Woolsey|pg||
mb|d|nt|ugis: Does anyone know at what time will the final start?|pg||
nt|queequeg: this is the last board of the Semifinal. The final will be Luxembourg-Estonia|pg||
nt|queequeg: 14.30 italian time|pg||
nt|queequeg: 8.30 EST, 13.30 UK|pg||
nt|ugis: thx :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when you hold the South hand, partner usually bids 3@c - and East doubles for penalties |pg||
nt|mdgraham: take care of the tens, and the ones can take care of themselves|pg||
nt|ady: needs a spade lead to defeat 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It will be interesting to see if North chooses 6@S or 6NT |pg||
nt|penseur9: Open Room OR that is|pg||
nt|mathat: yes @s +min|pg||
mb|4S|nt|elbec: would u overcall 2@d with E cards?|pg||
nt|penseur9: at the rate the OR is playing, Roland might again ffinish the voice commentaries in the OR again today|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW can make 3NT here - nine toppers. The power of aces (and, of course, the odd solid seven-card suit)  |pg||
nt|penseur9: That is a very light opening for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: thank you very much to Ugis Jansons :) Our commentator :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  for vg sched adjusted to your timezone.  Make it your home page!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: clubs not in the auction|pg||
nt|rv: Madala has made practical bid with everyone bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s practical|pg||
nt|mathat: practical bid|pg||
nt|rv: same comment by 3 of us, how frequent it is on BBO:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow, almost unanimous in the practical department|pg||
nt|psyck:  maybe, but N's @s could be better on a good day|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  this will be another double digit loss for the angelini team|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: i would raptorize it:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, so much for 3NT :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|reisig: Not wild abt 3@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe just shows six spades|pg||
nt|reisig: and 2@s showed 5?|pg||
nt|ady: slam even around 50 percent if played by east|pg||
nt|ritong: google "raptor bridge" if you want to know more about it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ugis: well, somehow the timetable on the web is wrong for this particular tournament :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S must have shown a fragment - can't really be natural, given the 3@D bid. Might have bid 4@H as well|pg||
nt|rv: 4@s is make here, 5@h would be 2 down|pg||
nt|psyck:  This session has been a quiet low scoring one so far, there were slams & doubled games every other deal previous session|pg||
nt|penseur9: 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|penseur9: hands I should say|pg||
pc|cT|nt|queequeg: that could be because they changed the times last minute|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|psyck:  hmm, now he will make 11|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: ah, but East is on lead|pg||
nt|ady: Valdemagra have picked up 20 imps in 2 recent hands|pg||
nt|ady: slam was missed on hand 27th|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and they led a club, too|pg||
nt|penseur9: this lead should make life easier for declarer|pg||

nt|psyck:  & did not want to risk it with the lead likely marked|pg||
nt|psyck:  w/o the @c he would have happily taken 10|pg||
nt|rv: CK, South will be caught in minor suit squeeze in any case rite?|pg||

nt|ady: best to forget the diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck:  now everyone wants to do something, just don't know what|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@c possible|pg||
nt|ady: naybe 2NT   clubs or diamonds?|pg||
nt|henryb:  they have been discussing whether Cappelletti or DONT is worth|pg||
nt|henryb:  worse|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2NT I think is LR+ with 3+ trumps.  3@D shows bal with extra values.|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@d = not min ..not slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: maybe|pg||
nt|ady: may find difficulty in bidding to 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes good point|pg||
nt|rv: coffee deal here, all games make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: although with three smnall spades and two small hearts, colour me chicken|pg||
nt|psyck:  will S try looking for 3rd round control in @c?|pg||
nt|rv: South could have splintered with 3@s, then on 4@d can blackwood though all roads lead to GS|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: Now Val di Magra is only 18 IMPs behind Allegra team|pg||
nt|psyck:  Thx Richie|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi Richie.|pg||
nt|reisig: hiya :)|pg||
nt|rv: 3@c showed @h fit|pg||
pc|s7|nt|penseur9: hi Richie|pg||
nt|penseur9: everything appears to be sitting favourably here|pg||
nt|psyck:  This is the 58th Italian Championship for Garozzo i'm told.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  I think if S had bid 3@s, West would have bid 4@c|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: 1@c is 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced. Not sure what the double implies|pg||
nt|psyck:  6@c after RKC response may ask for 3rd round control...|pg||
nt|rv: South's worry for GS will be North holding 3rd round control of @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 5@D now to check on @hQ|pg||
nt|rv: South still needs to find out both @HQ as well as 3rd control @c control, maybe he will chance GS even w/o explicit 3rd round control|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - 33 imps in 3 boards!|pg||
nt|henryb:  but with 3-3 spades, there is no particularly good reason to avoid 3N|pg||
pc|h4|nt|penseur9: however, to make 54 IMPs in last 4 hands for Val Di Magra appears next to impossible|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: that 6@H jump probably denies any side king|pg||
nt|rv: as a few knowledgable specs point if North showed @HQ with 5n, then South could have still bid 6@c|pg||
nt|psyck:  S will have to gamble on 3rd round @c control now|pg||
nt|rv: some play 5n response to queen ask to show 2 side kings and @HQ|pg||
nt|psyck:  5N would be showing trump Q & unshowable K's for some|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, more efficient to use 5N as showing the queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  bye|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|penseur9: bye Henry|pg||
nt|rv: this deal would be lot more interesting in MPs or BAM scoring, deal to relax in IMPs scoring|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d8|nt|psyck:  likely the unbalanced variation as N chose 3@c|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck:  either unshowable or 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|rv: wd, though not a very elegant auction,unlike in Gymnastics bridge doesn't have points for artistry:)|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a spec says, hurrah for the jack of spades|pg||

nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|wstuart: Contrast this to leading the @SJ first, then east would have to overtake any @S on the 2nd round - had trumps been 4-0, he would have to waste an entry to get back to dummy to play ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: a 3rd @S.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rv: incidentally even in OR, famed Bocchi-Madala pair didn't bid GS very scientifically, they also bid it w/o asking for 3rd round @c control|pg||
nt|ritong: three comparisons left for this segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Not exactly a low scoring set: 86 imps in 13 boards|pg||
nt|penseur9: very good point Wayne|pg||
nt|rv: yes, Allegra would start favorites in any World Champs:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb:  George, your partner made a vul overcall. Do you really think it is likely that the opponents, who died at 3@h, have a vul game? I would not|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ9+AKQ+AQ10xx+xx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when your opponents bid a laydown grand slam there is nothing you can do but hope that your teammates bid it as well|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d, 18-19 bal once again|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski has a problem here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s-2N-pass?|pg||
nt|psyck:  with @d's coming in, 4@s should make here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: part score this time   around 10 tricks in diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@C probably a catch-all for EW, as they play a strong NT   |pg||
nt|reisig: 3NT|pg||
nt|reisig: everyone agree 1@h ?|pg||
nt|psyck:  he will surely not pass 2N|pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps for the leaders on hand 29   part score in clubs open room|pg||
nt|ritong: then, a last set of 16 boards to decide who will play in the final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South did indeed bid 3@S directly at the other table, and bought the contract |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|psyck:  1@h not my style|pg||
nt|elbec: brave reopening by Lanzarotti|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: this hand is an excellent lesson|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: when you have no clear reason to think your side might make a game contract, just give up early, even in a known 4/3 major fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much that West can do here, it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  you think W won't need to finesse for the J@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: running scores: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
pc|c7|nt|reisig: I bid 1NT = bal|pg||
nt|psyck:  Ace & a 5 carder &  a 4 card maj|pg||
nt|psyck:  yeah well, what do i know|pg||
nt|rv: I presume 2@d opening denies 5M|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  Hedy thinks N should let them play. But as the saying goes, "Why should they go down when we can?"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 2@S, but no guarantees - and it wil be a 4/3 fit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, prefer 1NT. |pg||
nt|reisig: 3@s ..end???|pg||
nt|psyck:  wow, they bid better than us :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hmm. Something has Happened|pg||
nt|reisig: not likely|pg||
nt|reisig: that 3@s ..was 3NT"|pg||
nt|rv: that makes his pass a lot easier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-2@S-2NT would be an invite with four spades - East probably didn't think he was worth the invite |pg||
nt|psyck:  He has limited entries for finesses, will just play for drop or ruff it out|pg||
nt|rv: Fantoni's pass is bit timid in my view, he should atleast try for game with 3@c|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@c was the choice other room|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: aha|pg||
nt|psyck:  aaah, more like it|pg||
nt|rv: if that option was available, I might have taken it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wstuart: Over 1NT a popular method is to preaccept a xfr by bidding a doubleton.  Over 2NT, however, many prefer to cuebid a side source of tricks when preaccepting a xfr.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: more like it    but likely to go down|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I'm one of them|pg||
nt|psyck:  but non vul & their bids already limited in their system (they both had max for their bids)|pg||
nt|psyck:  E's hand still too tempting not to try|pg||
nt|rv: Fantoni had already shown 14+ with his choice of opening in their system, a few kibs feel he did have a case for passing in his system|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck:  and 1@s limited it to about this strength|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wstuart: 4@H was (obviously) a re-xfr.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|penseur9:  they ask the more experienced :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|psyck:  yes, i would have certainly invited at least, & 3N would have made here on normal @s lead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|psyck:  played by W, could have got a @s lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: atleast 9 tricks now w/o @d shift|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|penseur9:  Please adress your written questions to me please|pg||
nt|psyck:  oh, but not in that sequence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: if west decides to fight, it would be via 2@h i think  passing 1@s already indicates 3+ cards|pg||
nt|ritong: and very likely exactly three|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|psyck:  S would be on lead then & lead @d|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rv: in conventional std 1@d-1@s-2n, East had a easier pass|pg||

nt|penseur9: the finals will start in about two and a half hour... don't miss it|pg||
nt|wstuart: Usually, 3@C shows extra values without a more clear bid.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wstuart: Often it will contain 3@C and highlight @H (opener's suit) as a potential weakness.|pg||

pc|dK|nt|rv: I suspect 1 down here|pg||
nt|wstuart: He may well avoid a @C lead on this hand - east may think @Hs is the likely weakness.|pg||
nt|wstuart: West, I mean|pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb:  Well, Roland, in the previous sessions that I have done with both forms, any thanks to writers has only come after prompting|pg||
nt|reisig: Automatic ....for him !|pg||

nt|mathat: if Bocchi RDBL=A or K @h madala play 4 @h and made|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: sry once declarer loses trick to @SK, no real chance for making|pg||
nt|psyck:  well, at least this tightens up the match|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes, |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: if Pattacini had played @s to @SA, he might have scored especially on @DJ lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  oh oh|pg||
nt|wstuart: West had the info that east didn't overcall 1@H over 1@D, so his @H can;t be all that great.|pg||
nt|reisig: No comment|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes but a 28 -18 score for 16 hands is certainly tight scoring|pg||
