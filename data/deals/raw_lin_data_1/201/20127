mb|3H|nt|eweber: what a hand to start with!|pg||
nt|rv: E-W should score this comfortably, @c strain might have fetched 10 tricks though|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  predictable contract   but wont make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, West will enquire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's obvious now that East has hearts - it's the only suit he hasn't bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: told 3@c maximum, 3@s=hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: E-W should compete to 3@c here|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  They bid that way to right side |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  could well go overboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think soemone had better bid hearts soon|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: defence seems to have five tricks in clear view - two spades, two diamonds and a club |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as usual, when you lead fro KQ10, dummy has the jack and declarer the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, I was going to try my first voice, but somehow I don't seem to be accepted|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: Guisy, is Allegra a full 6 member team with Sementa and Duboin 3rd pair sitting out this segment?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eweber: at the other table East has jumped to 4@c over an art. 1@c opening|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psyck:  wonder if 4@s was kickback|pg||
nt|ady: looks to to be only 7 tricks   2 diamonds   3 hearts 1 club  and 1 further black suit trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like two spades, a club and a diamond to lose at first sight|pg||
pc|s3|nt|queequeg: welcome to Ugins Jansons :)|pg||
nt|ady: slam  can be played 2 ways   ruffing finesse of KQ@C    or  a squeeze on south if south has A@C   and Q@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it, 4NT=1 key|pg||
nt|psyck:  if so W knows two key cards missing|pg||
nt|ady: neither works|pg||
nt|psyck:  Running Scores: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eweber: ending up with North bidding and playing 4@h |pg||

nt|psyck:  more or less needs @cA right|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bg: GM all good save in 5 clubs 4 hearts max for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the good thing for NS here is that North is on lead, so South won't be tempted to lead a fatal ace|pg||

mb|1N|nt|queequeg: welcome to Dennis Kerasidis :)|pg||
nt|bg: Hi Dennis|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: fortunate lay  for 6@D|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kerasidis: :) good to have nice company:)|pg||
nt|ady: possible slam in hearts again     again fails|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  I all|pg||
nt|rv: classical 2n opening, rare to see nowadays in the age of multi and other multi meaning 1@c openings|pg||
nt|penseur9: test|pg||
mb|2D|nt|penseur9:  Sorry for the delay|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ady: clubs play for 6 winners so defence dont get therir spade trick   also diamonds 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a thin responsive double, but reasonable with four hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: VAL DI MAGRA Team: CAITI Stefano - COLOTTO Giuseppe - LANZAROTTI Massimo - MANNO Andrea - PATANE' Rosario - PATTACINI Maurizio - POCHINI Claudio - ZAFFINO Maurizio|pg||
nt|rv: Pattacini unlikely to find @DA lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: ALLEGRA Team: BOCCHI Norberto - DUBOIN Giorgio - GIUBILO Valerio - LAURIA Lorenzo - MADALA Agustin - SEMENTA Antonio - VERSACE Alfredo - ZALESKI Roman|pg||
nt|rv: ty Guisy|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Andre|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Hope everyone knows we have voice commentary as well, just press the play button next to each name in the bottom right corner |pg||
nt|penseur9:  Hi Oosmarb|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But you need to use the web client through  www.bridgebase.com  to get voice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: against the odds slam   around 37 percent|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is rather familiar|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: maximum and hearts|pg||
nt|ady: a chance to catch up  if they can find the slam   though would be lucky|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bg: good pass by N 2 H about limit with this distribution|pg||
nt|rv: even if declarer plays @C to @CK, Versace has only 8 tricks with @s suit not breaking beningly|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9: this should not cause any problem for declairer|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  This seems easy enough with @D breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  The system we think N-S play, more or less|pg||
nt|psyck:  this time they mey decide staying out with 2 key cards missing is a good idea after all|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: they should locate 2 key cards missing|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ugis: so Monaco has striked back - good news for the spectators (sorry Luxembourg :))|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia in the other semi has extended the lead and thus look strong contenders for the final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: identical bidding so far!|pg||
nt|psyck:  they are checking the back of the cards|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: well, if the defence switches to diamonds declarer may get locked in hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Actually dummy is blocked!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but that is not exactly easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still if there is one West who could find that defence, it is this one |pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Will probably be able to use defenders as stepping stone|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, East has no keys, so we should not see 4NT|pg||
nt|psyck:  5@c 03 this time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West knows two keys are missing now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: although it has to be the @DJ, otherwise the @D9 is a dummy entry|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure declarer is happy at the moment not being in 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play 5-card majors, so the @S9 is known to be a singleton  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: he has stolen !trick he desired, not enough though|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: gosh, this is complex|pg||
nt|penseur9:  very|pg||
nt|penseur9:  @S seems the best hope|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: dont seems to want to use rkc so they can avoid getting too high   though of course some days 6@H will make|pg||
nt|psyck:  W praying this wont be raised|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ugis: looks like -1 here and a push|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is more efficient, if hearts are trumps, to use 4@s as the keycard ask rather than 4NT|pg||
nt|ady: now praying K@H wrong|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|ady: apparnetly 4@S was their rkc on this sequence|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, declarer could hardly have Axx of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpn: made 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pelu: but it has been 10 hards days for the young players|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: pretty strong for Multi, even at these colors, but as i mentioned earlier, the national tendency in france is to be solid|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of play - and prob some party'es :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: I would also open 2@D :):)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: even within the context of French standards, 2D is marginal I think because of the playability in spades|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: obviously a style thing|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here all roads lead to 4S, though the D lead would probably be somewhat harder to read had the opening bid been 1H|pg||
nt|pelu: to day - spec in Europe - a lot of playeres know very well how to defend against Multi, so there are "many" who play Multi a little more contructiv that before |pg||
nt|marlowepi: here declarer can afford to suffer a ruff and it might well simplify the play for him by drawing a half-round of trumps:)|pg||

nt|psyck:  may start at 5 level|pg||
nt|rv: N-S have an excellent save of upto 6@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT by north    or 4@H makes |pg||
nt|rv: 3@d seems to be some variant of bergen raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: classic weak jump overcall|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rv: I suspect N-S may buy hand in 5@s after this start to auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I'm told West returned a heart|pg||
nt|psyck:  Versace did not want to bid 1st round with unpassed pd & unfav vul|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play double of 4@d here by North to show extras, double of cue bid below game level has diff meaning of cue bid above 4 level|pg||
nt|psyck:  NS fining the  double fit will help them save at appropriate level|pg||
nt|ady: most would open north hand|pg||
nt|ady: in spite  of their 10 card club fit   only 7 tricks for n/s in clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eweber: NS is playing a variable club system (Swedish style), 1@d shows 11-15 unbal with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c=FG with clubs or balanced or heart support|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski intends to show no wastage in @s  and plenty of working cards with his 4@s bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=10+-14 for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: auction in open room was simple 1-2-4|pg||
nt|bg: non vul with N hand should be preempting  and now S will not allow EW to play a vul game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@d=5+ hearts|pg||
nt|rv: great bidding so far|pg||
nt|psyck:  it sure helped W find the bid, whether to make or sac, it works|pg||
nt|psyck:  NS will take insurance at this vul i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: I would certainly bid 3s like W did here|pg||
nt|bg: oops error in judgement by NS|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs, N-S better advised to take insurance though North might fancy his chances to defend this|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: not too many problems on this one.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|kerasidis: what 3@c meant?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck:  2@d=4S, 11+ HCP, not yet GF|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|psyck:  2N = GF relay, was 3424 12, 2344 18, 4234 15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no sorry, can't read. 2@d shows spades|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|psyck:  3C = 4S-5H, 15+, sing. C|pg||
nt|rv: North might feel one of his rounded suits could fetch here though East's 4@s should have warned him|pg||
nt|psyck:  S should have bid 5@h instead of 5@s, that would have made the decision easier|pg||
nt|rv: now Versace in hot seat, will he get @c suit right?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 12-14; maybe they don't play the full Nightmare system |pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck:  3D = relay|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|psyck:  they must have changed the 3@c meaning|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and maybe it has changed since 2005.....|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kerasidis: weak clubs? hiding the dia fit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: looks like a nice lay for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck:  Though their 1 level openings are generally 14+, 1@h can be 11 + when with 4 @s's|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|bg: 3 clubs should be a fit showing jump  weak|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: looks kije 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: he might just play North for 5-5-1-2 and play for @CK doubleton inside|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Unlucky board for Allegra, 4@H seems like a decent contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6 imps back to Allegra|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry all, a bit of trouble here... all OK now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psyck:  yes, that looks more likely due to the 4@h bid, but N may not have doubled with that shape|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all. Sorry I'm late|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck:  gm Mike|pg||
nt|rv: Versace can play a) @CK doubleton with North b) @CKTX with North c) @CKXX with North and @CTX with South|pg||
nt|rv: gm Mike|pg||
nt|rv: only c) works here, I suspect he will play for a) or b) if he can smoke out distribution|pg||

nt|penseur9: could EW get too high here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 3@c from West looks as if 2NT was kind of Lebensohl|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: e/w overboard now |pg||
mb|4S|an|!H|nt|eweber: NS play neg. lead directing doubles from 3level if I remember their sys correctly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  3@C I meant|pg||
nt|elbec: nice choice by S who decided to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  as the cards are both 4@s & 3N make|pg||
nt|psyck:  3N superior of course|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: typical Bergen would be 7-9, but the shape is good |pg||
nt|psyck:  3H = 5+H GF, 1-suiter or 4S-5H (was 4522 12, 2812 13, 3532 16)|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@d was no major|pg||
nt|rv: both pointed suits break beningly here, 4@s is a easy make|pg||

nt|elbec: @d lead would have easily defeated this. let's see versace's play|pg||
mb|5C|an|0-3|nt|mdgraham: if West bid bid 4@c, and it was passed out, then one can safely say that a misunderstanding has occurred  |pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|nt|eweber: anyone here who knows the EW system?|pg||
nt|eweber: well, I learned that they play a strong club sys, but for the XX we can only assume that it might show a half stopper|pg||
nt|rv: though Allegra lost 7 IMPs on deal 3, they had outbid their opps and would have scored plenty of IMPs if @CK was South or if @CKTX was with North|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Smolen would be 3@s by South to show 4@S5@h |pg||
nt|psyck:  4@d cue with fit|pg||

nt|ady: 9 tricks in diamonds the lomit if e/w get a club ruff|pg||
nt|rv: presume 2n is transfer to @ds|pg||
nt|penseur9: on board  3 the open room was down 1 on 5@S for 13 IMPs for Allegra team|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: yes, surprising for such an experienced pair|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may make 9 tricks in either major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently Garozzo plays every day on BBO|pg||
nt|rv: will Zaleski double this to show major?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rv: Versace might just bid 3@s here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: over this kind of transfer. North has two bids available. He can bid either 3@c or 3@d, so some pairs use them to distinguish the kind of minor suit fit|pg||
nt|rv: if Zaleski had acted on 1n, E-W might have got to game, here I suspect they will stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: Pattacini's 1n opening might just have worked here|pg||
nt|elbec: NS open 1@d with 4@d and 5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but fairly normal to lead your own suit after the 3@C support raise  |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb:  I mightve bid 4@d as North here, nothing to be ashamed about in that hand (except perhaps @S quality)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|eweber: NS play a variable club system (Sedish style), 2@d promises 55|pg||
nt|eweber: of course South can reach N with @s then|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: be nice to have a support raise in which ever minor is better|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 2@c was sort of transfer|pg||
nt|psyck:  no entry to hand for @s finesse|pg||
nt|rv: again winning decision by Versace, I might have just bid 3@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  the 3rd @h would work if he guesses|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if East might have bid directly over 1NT, rather than waiting until the bidding got to the three level?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: should go -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: take the cash|pg||
nt|psyck:  but he has lesses @d than @h & may misguess like other room|pg||
nt|rv: @CKQ in Versace may not pull too much weight since his Zaleski is predominantly showing majors|pg||
nt|psyck:  now will make|pg||
nt|rv: on this bidding, I would have just bid 3@s with West hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: depends if there are any limits on the 2NT bid|pg||
nt|ady: west does not like defending|pg||

nt|bg: by W|pg||
nt|ady: if e/w defending persisted in a defence playing spades  then 3NT might have made|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: think South should have played the queen of diamonds, not the jack - if pard has underled the king, this lets him know immediately he has done the right thing - if the jack, he ...|pg||

nt|rv: I would double 3@h as well|pg||
nt|psyck:  3 is more of a problem, but with perfect hape, matx values, intermediary cards, x of 2@h was standout|pg||

nt|ady: whoever plays  going down|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ritong: here, double by lauria does not mean " they are cooked", it rather means " pard, i d like to go to 5@s, what do you think?"|pg||

nt|ugis: if E plays low...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with 1065 in spades, i'd need a good reason not to lead them - like AKQJX in hearts, perhaps  |pg||
nt|rv: I presume East has indicated no interest in @ds|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: and Garozzo wasn't going to get the hearts wrong|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes, You wouldn't open 2@D to say, I have 18-19 balanced, and then 2NT to say, Did you hear me, partner? I have 18-19 balanced. There has to be a good reason to bid 2NT |pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: sry, didn't see Versace's opening|pg||
nt|henryb:  The voice commenters are discussing signalling styles|pg||
nt|penseur9: they should take a short break so we get compairisions with the OR|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eweber: NS is allowed to open a 14-16 NT with 5card M but this is not the hand to use such an option|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck:  Bocchi overcalled 1N here & got to 3N|pg||

nt|ady: will have tp play on spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  If @c aren't 3-0, the hand is cold. If E has the 3, you will find out. and if West has the 3, you need to unblock the 8 so that you can win a second @c cheaply in the S hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: ultra modern opening, ZAR point or any other hand eval system will insist you open|pg||

nt|psyck:  10 is not considered an honour but with 10x we lead with 10.|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S started this set down 21 imps. I do not see (except from the scores) why N-S should think that they are now down 60.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: a diamond lead beats it, of course, but how can South lead that? |pg||
nt|psyck:  3@d on 2@d would be 5@s & 4@h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: not the best switch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they have got both 3NT and 4@h declared by West, so all is well|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eweber: as cards lie 3NT is unbeatable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it would be interesting to see the results of a computer simulation of 2@S by North- what the percentages are |pg||
nt|psyck:  That is NS carding style...|pg||

mb|p|nt|eweber: the last few boards have been what a team with a big lead must be wishing for: quite boring|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: amusing auction next door. Everybody bid suits they haven't got |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, the previous opening was AAK. |pg||
nt|rv: just 25 IMPs, still enough boards for Val Di Magra to turn this around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ugis: Does anyone know at what time will the final start?|pg||

nt|queequeg: 8.30 EST, 13.30 UK|pg||
nt|ugis: thx :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when you hold the South hand, partner usually bids 3@c - and East doubles for penalties |pg||
nt|mdgraham: take care of the tens, and the ones can take care of themselves|pg||
nt|ady: needs a spade lead to defeat 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It will be interesting to see if North chooses 6@S or 6NT |pg||
nt|penseur9: Open Room OR that is|pg||
mb|1N|nt|elbec: would u overcall 2@d with E cards?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: EW can make 3NT here - nine toppers. The power of aces (and, of course, the odd solid seven-card suit)  |pg||
nt|penseur9: That is a very light opening for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|queequeg: thank you very much to Ugis Jansons :) Our commentator :)|pg||

pc|c6|nt|reisig: Not wild abt 3@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe just shows six spades|pg||
nt|reisig: and 2@s showed 5?|pg||
nt|ady: slam even around 50 percent if played by east|pg||
nt|ritong: google "raptor bridge" if you want to know more about it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ugis: well, somehow the timetable on the web is wrong for this particular tournament :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S must have shown a fragment - can't really be natural, given the 3@D bid. Might have bid 4@H as well|pg||
nt|rv: 4@s is make here, 5@h would be 2 down|pg||
nt|psyck:  This session has been a quiet low scoring one so far, there were slams & doubled games every other deal previous session|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|queequeg: that could be because they changed the times last minute|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even +1 on the double club hook|pg||

nt|henryb:  they have been discussing whether Cappelletti or DONT is worth|pg||
nt|henryb:  worse|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: maybe|pg||
nt|ady: may find difficulty in bidding to 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: although with three smnall spades and two small hearts, colour me chicken|pg||
nt|psyck:  will S try looking for 3rd round control in @c?|pg||
nt|rv: South could have splintered with 3@s, then on 4@d can blackwood though all roads lead to GS|pg||
mb|3S|nt|elbec: Now Val di Magra is only 18 IMPs behind Allegra team|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think if S had bid 3@s, West would have bid 4@c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: 1@c is 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced. Not sure what the double implies|pg||
nt|psyck:  6@c after RKC response may ask for 3rd round control...|pg||
nt|rv: South's worry for GS will be North holding 3rd round control of @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 5@D now to check on @hQ|pg||
nt|rv: South still needs to find out both @HQ as well as 3rd control @c control, maybe he will chance GS even w/o explicit 3rd round control|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes - 33 imps in 3 boards!|pg||
nt|henryb:  but with 3-3 spades, there is no particularly good reason to avoid 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: however, to make 54 IMPs in last 4 hands for Val Di Magra appears next to impossible|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: that 6@H jump probably denies any side king|pg||
nt|rv: as a few knowledgable specs point if North showed @HQ with 5n, then South could have still bid 6@c|pg||
nt|psyck:  S will have to gamble on 3rd round @c control now|pg||
nt|rv: some play 5n response to queen ask to show 2 side kings and @HQ|pg||
nt|psyck:  5N would be showing trump Q & unshowable K's for some|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, more efficient to use 5N as showing the queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  bye|pg||
pc|s5|nt|penseur9: bye Henry|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|psyck:  likely the unbalanced variation as N chose 3@c|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: as a spec says, hurrah for the jack of spades|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rv: incidentally even in OR, famed Bocchi-Madala pair didn't bid GS very scientifically, they also bid it w/o asking for 3rd round @c control|pg||
nt|ritong: three comparisons left for this segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Not exactly a low scoring set: 86 imps in 13 boards|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  George, your partner made a vul overcall. Do you really think it is likely that the opponents, who died at 3@h, have a vul game? I would not|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ9+AKQ+AQ10xx+xx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when your opponents bid a laydown grand slam there is nothing you can do but hope that your teammates bid it as well|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d, 18-19 bal once again|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski has a problem here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s-2N-pass?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: part score this time   around 10 tricks in diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@C probably a catch-all for EW, as they play a strong NT   |pg||
nt|reisig: 3NT|pg||
nt|reisig: everyone agree 1@h ?|pg||
nt|psyck:  he will surely not pass 2N|pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps for the leaders on hand 29   part score in clubs open room|pg||
nt|ritong: then, a last set of 16 boards to decide who will play in the final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South did indeed bid 3@S directly at the other table, and bought the contract |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck:  1@h not my style|pg||
nt|elbec: brave reopening by Lanzarotti|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: this hand is an excellent lesson|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: when you have no clear reason to think your side might make a game contract, just give up early, even in a known 4/3 major fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much that West can do here, it seems|pg||
pc|c5|nt|reisig: I bid 1NT = bal|pg||
nt|psyck:  Ace & a 5 carder &  a 4 card maj|pg||
nt|psyck:  yeah well, what do i know|pg||
nt|rv: I presume 2@d opening denies 5M|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hedy thinks N should let them play. But as the saying goes, "Why should they go down when we can?"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 2@S, but no guarantees - and it wil be a 4/3 fit|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: no, prefer 1NT. |pg||
nt|reisig: 3@s ..end???|pg||
nt|psyck:  wow, they bid better than us :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hmm. Something has Happened|pg||
nt|reisig: not likely|pg||
nt|reisig: that 3@s ..was 3NT"|pg||
nt|rv: that makes his pass a lot easier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-2@S-2NT would be an invite with four spades - East probably didn't think he was worth the invite |pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: aha|pg||
nt|psyck:  aaah, more like it|pg||
nt|rv: if that option was available, I might have taken it|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i would have certainly invited at least, & 3N would have made here on normal @s lead|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|psyck:  played by W, could have got a @s lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: atleast 9 tricks now w/o @d shift|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: tried to pin stiff J@D|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|penseur9:  Please adress your written questions to me please|pg||
nt|psyck:  oh, but not in that sequence|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: if west decides to fight, it would be via 2@h i think  passing 1@s already indicates 3+ cards|pg||
nt|ritong: and very likely exactly three|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|psyck:  S would be on lead then & lead @d|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|rv: in conventional std 1@d-1@s-2n, East had a easier pass|pg||

nt|henryb:  So we can predict based on trends that there will be 13 imps scored on these last two boards|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerability wrong for a n/s save|pg||
nt|ritong: an other good lesson|pg||
nt|henryb:  Unless there is a large unexpected swing on this board, "The fat lady just sang!" :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: go quiet with no sure fit, go wild with sure fits, especially @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: rehi, sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW might get to 4@S here |pg||
nt|penseur9: with 2 boards left to play, it's reasonable to say that the Allegra team will be in the finals|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|elbec: 5@c are really too many...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: it should go down though|pg||
nt|henryb:  Over 14 boards, 90 imps have been scored, which is almost exactly 6 1/2 a board. So I predict another 13. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  yes, would have had some chance only if played by W & lead not found|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9: another way to say it Mike :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at a cautious guess, yes. Well done to them. They have played very well this set |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|reisig: 4@s ..wow|pg||
nt|reisig: 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: gosh, 4@s. Going it a bit|pg||
nt|psyck:  4@s= I have 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|ritong: feeling protected with odds, henry?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two hearts and a diamond to lose?|pg||
nt|elbec: 5 imps coming....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: awkward on repeated heart leads|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: 2@h is retransfer back to @s?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: this  can make if Verace gets diamond position right  and no heart lead|pg||
nt|elbec: only @h lead...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed. Nothice that 5@c is down 2 on a @d lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: with trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now just hammer away with hearts|pg||
nt|elbec: nicely done Lanzarotti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: so what do we know?|pg||
nt|ritong: south has cards, more or less balanced|pg||
nt|ritong: north has a bunch of @cs|pg||
nt|fulldire: if west put the King of @H in dummy he makes|pg||
nt|fulldire: now 1 off|pg||
nt|ritong: and probably a high card onside, like the @d K|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think North's invitation is minimum, and South's accept is not even close|pg||
nt|penseur9: very well indeed|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ritong: so if north is singleton @h we are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: And in all the other sets too, come to that |pg||
pc|sK|nt|reisig: That bid NEVER entered my mind :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: hence, playing the @h K was highly possible|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|queequeg: the next round is starting at 14.30 italian time, 13.30 UK, 8.30 EST|pg||
nt|rv: some play lead of King or Ace and shifting to short suit shows stiff and leading other honor and shifting shows doubleton|pg||
nt|fulldire: not easy but possible expecially for versace depend on lead how they lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: stil  needs @DK down in three, for the heart discard from dummy - which it does|pg||
nt|penseur9: right you are|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|rv: this distinction will help partner in ducking when appropriate, doesn't matter here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb:  If Versace leads a low @d, N has to grab the K and lead a second @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  But then there aren't enough trumps|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck:  E promised a big hand, but as you say, with 4333, it was certainly aggresive|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: nice phrase, Krishna - "certainly aggressive". We know what you mean :)  |pg||
nt|reisig: A well deserved result :)|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck:  Voice commentary will continue in other room after this table finishes|pg||
nt|fulldire: yes he needed also the 8 of @H in the hand to make the play i suggested|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd North|pg||
nt|fulldire: the 8 of @D|pg||
nt|henryb:  but he will make it anyway|pg||
nt|henryb:  true|pg||
