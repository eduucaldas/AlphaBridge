nt|santyclz: Minors is mine.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: not alerted|pg||
nt|sybarra: you might be right Joe |pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, so the alert is a mistake?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: the 2NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: the more I look at I think 2 nt is minors |pg||
nt|sybarra: as point out to me should be minors,  since 1 @C did not promise clubs |pg||
nt|baldfriede: another possibility of the meaning of the pass is showing lack of @c control, but the Redouble makes that rather unlikely|pg||
nt|santyclz: The fact that the pass was alerted makes me think it was forcing.  If n doesn't bid, e must xx.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, it is the most likely explanation|pg||
nt|sybarra: the fact that we are guessing is that most pairs at this level have serveral hundred pages of system notes |pg||
nt|santyclz: "Mandatory Redoubles"  A system frequently played by weak nt players,  less  often with strong nts,.|pg||
nt|sybarra: even if we had the system cards,  we would not know where to look in the notes|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: drijver doesn't know either|pg||
nt|baldfriede: too true, Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe Bas,  having problem remembering page 336   (or what ever page it is) |pg||
nt|helene_t:  Ton and Frank bakkeren are brothers but a recently re-established partnership, as Ton used to play with Huub Bertens who is playing at the other table|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|helene_t:  they play fairly standard methods. 2/1 GF ie the 2@h response forces to game, so Ton can temporize with 2nt|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|baldfriede: 2nt apparently does not mean minors though|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: there will be discussions about this hand no doubt |pg||

pc|hK|pc|s5|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|sybarra: wonder what 3 @C would have promised in pass out seat |pg||
nt|baldfriede: the biggest horror at any bridge table is the moment you realize that your partner totally misunderstands your last bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: but his pard could have promised only 2 clubs |pg||
nt|santyclz: @c switch here for the 2nd undertrick.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Wd by w to find it.  It's easy from up here but at the table a @h continuation would seem natural.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|santyclz: Well, "disaster" is an overbid.  Another -50 or two.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, declarer should try to minimize his losses, not to make|pg||
nt|santyclz: -100|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: Brink says it's a strange club|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx both of my fellow commentators,  leaving in your good hands.  I have to leave for appt.  I will be back later |pg||
nt|baldfriede: bye Shirley|pg||
nt|santyclz: See you later, Shirley.|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Brink does not trust the J@c discardd. not with the 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|santyclz: Theoretically e needs  1 minor suit k for his nt overcall but can't have both.|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: indeed he keep saying the J is strange|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nt overcalls sometimes extend to 18 opposite a passed partner though.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: one would expect the K of @D to be on side given the bidding |pg||
nt|baldfriede: Verbeek apparently tries to give that impression|pg||
nt|santyclz: S now has a "chance to make" by cashing the @h honors and relying on the @d finesse.  This would mean disaster here.|pg||
