nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all|pg||
nt|penseur9: with 42 IMPs deficit, the Angelini team still has a good chance... they will have to have a good round here if they want to still have a chance at a win... good bridge|pg||

nt|psyck: indeed, a tough call for W|pg||
nt|warrens:  hello Andre|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: he surely had methods for every shape :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eweber: hi everyone, welcome back to the 2nd half of this final|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: take out double I presume|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: 2@d presumably a Multi, or maybe just a weak two|pg||
nt|penseur9:  welcome back to the final segment of the semi-final|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|andyv:  hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|penseur9: 3@D looks like a Bergen raise|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure I agree with 3NT ... 7 controls ... and 3@H has surely someting to do with slam try |pg||
mb|4H|nt|eweber: what a hand to start with!|pg||
nt|rv: E-W should score this comfortably, @c strain might have fetched 10 tricks though|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  predictable contract   but wont make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, West will enquire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's obvious now that East has hearts - it's the only suit he hasn't bid|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: told 3@c maximum, 3@s=hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: yes , reverse, 3@c would be the limit raise|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d makes the long suit & slam interest clear, & E has 7 controls!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: E-W should compete to 3@c here|pg||
nt|psyck: so they will surely get to slam|pg||
nt|penseur9: well undrway now|pg||
nt|penseur9: *underway|pg||
nt|danilo1: once East bid 3NT, thk now he should bid eve 5@H = AK@H+@S control (West denied @S control)|pg||
nt|danilo1: *even %@H|pg||
nt|danilo1: *5@H|pg||
mb|6C|nt|psyck:  They bid that way to right side |pg||
nt|psyck:  good lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  Hi Andy|pg||
nt|ady: had east been a little weaker and west had an ace  then this could go down with a club ruff|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: hi Andre|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  could well go overboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think soemone had better bid hearts soon|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mdgraham: defence seems to have five tricks in clear view - two spades, two diamonds and a club |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as usual, when you lead fro KQ10, dummy has the jack and declarer the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, I was going to try my first voice, but somehow I don't seem to be accepted|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Guisy, is Allegra a full 6 member team with Sementa and Duboin 3rd pair sitting out this segment?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: at the other table East has jumped to 4@c over an art. 1@c opening|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|psyck:  wonder if 4@s was kickback|pg||
nt|ady: looks to to be only 7 tricks   2 diamonds   3 hearts 1 club  and 1 further black suit trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like two spades, a club and a diamond to lose at first sight|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Krishna|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  tricky defence required to beat this?|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, @d switch needed|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can count up to 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|psyck:  & @h will be entry to cash @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bill|pg||
nt|danilo1: well judged old champ :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|queequeg: welcome to Ugins Jansons :)|pg||
nt|ady: slam  can be played 2 ways   ruffing finesse of KQ@C    or  a squeeze on south if south has A@C   and Q@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it, 4NT=1 key|pg||
nt|psyck:  if so W knows two key cards missing|pg||
nt|ady: neither works|pg||
nt|psyck:  Running Scores: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eweber: ending up with North bidding and playing 4@h |pg||
nt|ady: ruffing finesse best odds|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|queequeg: Ugis|pg||
nt|ugis: hello everyone|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck:  E got tempted by the void|pg||
nt|psyck:  def has easy road to 5 tricks now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ugis: well done NS - they have reached a top spot on this deal|pg||
nt|psyck:  more or less needs @cA right|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  West has to duck this ... then the switch|pg||
nt|andyv:  K@h overtake Q@s and play 10@h|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d was 3 card 10-11 or 4 card 7-11 as per above CC|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bg: GM all good save in 5 clubs 4 hearts max for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the good thing for NS here is that North is on lead, so South won't be tempted to lead a fatal ace|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rv: I am told yes to my earlier question of 3rd pair by knowledgable specs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg:  http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: had east been declarer then A@C might have been led|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Wayne Stuart|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi everyone.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: 9@C   Lauria duck|pg||
nt|psyck:  we still have lesser specs here than other room, the kibs are pampered by getting to watch Papi daily on BBO anyway|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: now should cash out for down 2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kerasidis: hi all!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|penseur9: he's down now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck:  now he knows it is not, may try for @sq drom or some finess|pg||
nt|kemperg: on kickback 1403 not nessesary|pg||
nt|queequeg: Running Scores http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Francesca|pg||
nt|queequeg: ciao :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  switch was easy to find|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Madala takes things out of partner's hands|pg||
nt|andyv:  cash out time for down 1|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck:  * or some squeeze|pg||
nt|psyck: other room did not take the @h double fin & made 4@h|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|psyck:  Sementa-Duboin the 3rd pair|pg||
nt|psyck:  they palyed yesterday in the match shown on vu gr|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s9|nt|ady: squeeze on south looks best now  but wont work|pg||
pc|dK|nt|penseur9: I beleive, could be wrong|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Nunes forlornly hoped for 3-3 diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  hoping for @ds to split|pg||
nt|psyck: does not have too many options in the play|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2:  Audio through the web client at  www.bridgebase.com    maybe CK can explain the procedure|pg||
nt|psyck:  Instructions for voice here: http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743|pg||
nt|psyck:  bascically you need to get to the vu gr room from the browser version|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|penseur9: sorry my mistke|pg||
nt|danilo1: well .. do not thk he is down ... do not believe he will play small @C from AK :)|pg||

nt|andyv:  the other contract that was possible was 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both tables got it right|pg||
mb|1D|nt|queequeg: welcome to Dennis Kerasidis :)|pg||
nt|bg: Hi Dennis|pg||
nt|henryb:  Unlucky in diamonds, lucky in love :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: fortunate lay  for 6@D|pg||
nt|penseur9: with eleven, we have a match my friends|pg||
nt|penseur9: eleven IMPs|pg||
nt|danilo1: intersting 3NT EW|pg||
nt|psyck: non @s lead, after two trumps, if they do not break, he could try @c discard on @h & try to bring @cq 3rd down|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kerasidis: :) good to have nice company:)|pg||
nt|ady: possible slam in hearts again     again fails|pg||
nt|danilo1: that would make too Krishma .. provided that he preserve @DA at the table |pg||
mb|d|nt|penseur9:  I all|pg||
nt|rv: classical 2n opening, rare to see nowadays in the age of multi and other multi meaning 1@c openings|pg||
nt|penseur9: test|pg||
mb|5D|nt|penseur9:  Sorry for the delay|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  cheap contract|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
nt|ady: e/w likely to play 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: clubs play for 6 winners so defence dont get therir spade trick   also diamonds 3-2|pg||
nt|penseur9: I expected them tobe in NT|pg||
nt|psyck:  some would bid 1N as E at this vul|pg||
nt|psyck: & will make in comfort|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: a thin responsive double, but reasonable with four hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: VAL DI MAGRA Team: CAITI Stefano - COLOTTO Giuseppe - LANZAROTTI Massimo - MANNO Andrea - PATANE' Rosario - PATTACINI Maurizio - POCHINI Claudio - ZAFFINO Maurizio|pg||
nt|rv: Pattacini unlikely to find @DA lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: ALLEGRA Team: BOCCHI Norberto - DUBOIN Giorgio - GIUBILO Valerio - LAURIA Lorenzo - MADALA Agustin - SEMENTA Antonio - VERSACE Alfredo - ZALESKI Roman|pg||
nt|rv: ty Guisy|pg||
nt|psyck:  but a poor idea when both opps are passed|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c game forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Andre|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Hope everyone knows we have voice commentary as well, just press the play button next to each name in the bottom right corner |pg||
nt|penseur9:  Hi Oosmarb|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But you need to use the web client through  www.bridgebase.com  to get voice|pg||
nt|psyck: playing for Hx or 33 in @s|pg||
nt|danilo1: (+ @SA as entry still at the table|pg||
nt|psyck: the required rate has dropped from some 1.5imp per board to 1 imp per board|pg||
nt|penseur9: that will make these two remaining rounds more interesting|pg||
nt|danilo1: with 7 potential @D tricks (guess 2@H = Forcing) ... thk East should consider 3NT possibility ... so jump to 5@D could wait ... instead - I propose 2@Sbid|pg||
nt|psyck: any alert on the 2@h operator?|pg||
nt|henryb:  which is exactly what N has: a good hand with hearts|pg||
nt|penseur9: Giusy, some people would like to know if the bidding went as shown here|pg||
nt|henryb:  As Bill was speculating orally|pg||
nt|danilo1: Congrats to Fantunes for putting 3NT -1 ... needed fast @C switch - not to easy|pg||
nt|psyck: operator says 2@h was not alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: against the odds slam   around 37 percent|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is rather familiar|pg||
nt|penseur9: re-hi CK|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maximum and hearts|pg||
nt|ady: a chance to catch up  if they can find the slam   though would be lucky|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Andre & David|pg||
nt|penseur9: ok tks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bg: good pass by N 2 H about limit with this distribution|pg||
nt|rv: even if declarer plays @C to @CK, Versace has only 8 tricks with @s suit not breaking beningly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|penseur9: this should not cause any problem for declairer|pg||
nt|penseur9: good point CK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  This seems easy enough with @D breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  The system we think N-S play, more or less|pg||
nt|psyck:  this time they mey decide staying out with 2 key cards missing is a good idea after all|pg||
nt|wstuart: As a passed hand, with the opponents not competing, it is very likely that opener has a very good hand, so passing in this situation is quite reasonable.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Interestingly, had west opened in first seat, bidding 1NT with east has much more going for it.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: they should locate 2 key cards missing|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s obviously didn't show @s....maybe showed short @s|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ugis: so Monaco has striked back - good news for the spectators (sorry Luxembourg :))|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia in the other semi has extended the lead and thus look strong contenders for the final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: identical bidding so far!|pg||
nt|psyck:  they are checking the back of the cards|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Wayne, welcome|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi Andre|pg||
nt|ady: club lead holds to 9 tricks   otherwise 10 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|psyck: @h likely|pg||
nt|penseur9: exactly|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: well, if the defence switches to diamonds declarer may get locked in hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Actually dummy is blocked!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but that is not exactly easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still if there is one West who could find that defence, it is this one |pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Will probably be able to use defenders as stepping stone|pg||
nt|psyck: so there will be no beer here|pg||
nt|henryb:  At the other table Fantoni led a high heart, and then it was indeed necessary to shift to a club|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: however, East has no keys, so we should not see 4NT|pg||
nt|psyck:  5@c 03 this time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West knows two keys are missing now|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although it has to be the @DJ, otherwise the @D9 is a dummy entry|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure declarer is happy at the moment not being in 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play 5-card majors, so the @S9 is known to be a singleton  |pg||
nt|psyck:  now comfortable|pg||
nt|psyck:  Nunes neeeded to paly @dA 1st round|pg||
nt|henryb:  This will not be the easiest contract to make|pg||
nt|penseur9: not at all, even with 25 points|pg||
nt|psyck: @h towards T is normal, & with @d33, can get 3@h, 3@c, 2@c, 1!a|pg||
nt|psyck: the problem is doing it in right order & keeping wrong hands out|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rv: he has stolen !trick he desired, not enough though|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: gosh, this is complex|pg||
nt|penseur9:  very|pg||
nt|penseur9:  @S seems the best hope|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: dont seems to want to use rkc so they can avoid getting too high   though of course some days 6@H will make|pg||
nt|psyck:  W praying this wont be raised|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Val di Magra: http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Val_di_Vara_e_Magra.JPG&filetimestamp=20060811235645|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ugis: looks like -1 here and a push|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: it is more efficient, if hearts are trumps, to use 4@s as the keycard ask rather than 4NT|pg||
nt|ady: now praying K@H wrong|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  Nunes not ready for the @d back|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: apparnetly 4@S was their rkc on this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: @h set up , not has to work on @d depending on whether they play @s or @c now, keep appropriate hand out|pg||
pc|dK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ugis: sorry 3 imps to Lux|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kerasidis: there is always a question about thiese hands ...whether to rebid a 4 card suit or the 6 card|pg||
pc|sT|nt|penseur9: this is a difficult hand both for declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer reads the position he can make the hand, although he may not|pg||
nt|ady: no problems when J@S appears  showing that good intermediates can often help|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when in doubt - run the long suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: excellent technique by Versace, playing for small extra chance of @SJ doubleton before trying for 3-3 break|pg||
nt|psyck:  now trying for some blockage & endplay|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: apparently|pg||
nt|psyck: now can just win & duck a @d to N|pg||
nt|psyck: most lines will make now|pg||
nt|henryb:  as long as N doesn't have @dQ10xx, declarer can win this and run the @d7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one loser at the end |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: interesting if West leads a low spade at trick 2 and East ducks the 9 or J  |pg||
nt|penseur9:  all OK|pg||
nt|penseur9:  all is OK|pg||
nt|penseur9:  all is OK|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|pelu: I would also open 2@D :):)|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ady: 3NT by north    or 4@H makes |pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: I suspect N-S may buy hand in 5@s after this start to auction|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: I'm told West returned a heart|pg||
nt|psyck:  Versace did not want to bid 1st round with unpassed pd & unfav vul|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play double of 4@d here by North to show extras, double of cue bid below game level has diff meaning of cue bid above 4 level|pg||
nt|psyck:  NS fining the  double fit will help them save at appropriate level|pg||
nt|ady: most would open north hand|pg||
nt|ady: in spite  of their 10 card club fit   only 7 tricks for n/s in clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|eweber: NS is playing a variable club system (Swedish style), 1@d shows 11-15 unbal with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c=FG with clubs or balanced or heart support|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski intends to show no wastage in @s  and plenty of working cards with his 4@s bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=10+-14 for NS|pg||
nt|psyck:  you can also listen to the voice commentaary in this room, only via the browser link|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: auction in open room was simple 1-2-4|pg||
nt|bg: non vul with N hand should be preempting  and now S will not allow EW to play a vul game|pg||
nt|wstuart: I wonder if 4@H would be a splinter at this point?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@d=5+ hearts|pg||
nt|rv: great bidding so far|pg||
nt|psyck:  it sure helped W find the bid, whether to make or sac, it works|pg||
nt|psyck:  NS will take insurance at this vul i suppose|pg||
nt|ady: the overcall may prompt Lauria to play east for Ace doubleton club|pg||
nt|danilo1: may not be asy way to beat 4@D ... still .. somehow - East should find @C ruff|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ugis: I would certainly bid 3s like W did here|pg||
nt|bg: oops error in judgement by NS|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs, N-S better advised to take insurance though North might fancy his chances to defend this|pg||
nt|penseur9: great lead for declarer|pg||
nt|danilo1: *4@S|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is surely not the lead to agree with|pg||
nt|danilo1: is it not too dangerous lead .. - I see that beats .. but still|pg||
nt|henryb:  You might lead a trump|pg||
nt|psyck: single trump not tempting either|pg||
nt|psyck: i'd probably chose @h too|pg||
nt|henryb:  since South is known to be 3-4-xy with a singleton in one of the minors|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: not too many problems on this one.|pg||
nt|andyv:  on 18, Nunes had to win A@d and lead @h back, perserving the K@d as entry to the @hs in E hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|kerasidis: what 3@c meant?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@d=4S, 11+ HCP, not yet GF|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|psyck:  2N = GF relay, was 3424 12, 2344 18, 4234 15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no sorry, can't read. 2@d shows spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  not an easy hand to play|pg||
nt|psyck:  nor to bid, not sure what the bids mean here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck:  3C = 4S-5H, 15+, sing. C|pg||
nt|rv: North might feel one of his rounded suits could fetch here though East's 4@s should have warned him|pg||
nt|psyck:  S should have bid 5@h instead of 5@s, that would have made the decision easier|pg||
nt|rv: now Versace in hot seat, will he get @c suit right?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 12-14; maybe they don't play the full Nightmare system |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 2@c was stuck for bid over 1@s and 2@d was checkback|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck:  3D = relay|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|psyck:  they must have changed the 3@c meaning|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and maybe it has changed since 2005.....|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kerasidis: weak clubs? hiding the dia fit|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a nice lay for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  and on 18, W did go up with the A@d and 12 more imps to Allegra team|pg||
nt|psyck:  i'd guess 2@c probably a variety of hands & 2@d asked|pg||
nt|danilo1: why not just lead @DA .. looks normal to me ... South has one minor with @H ... so pd may have ruff |pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck:  Though their 1 level openings are generally 14+, 1@h can be 11 + when with 4 @s's|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|nt|bg: 3 clubs should be a fit showing jump  weak|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: looks kije 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: he might just play North for 5-5-1-2 and play for @CK doubleton inside|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec believes 2@c asked p to bid 2@d and then 2@h showed 4@h|pg||
nt|psyck: could even afford to misgues on that lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oosmanb:  Unlucky board for Allegra, 4@H seems like a decent contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6 imps back to Allegra|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry all, a bit of trouble here... all OK now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck:  yes, that looks more likely due to the 4@h bid, but N may not have doubled with that shape|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all. Sorry I'm late|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck:  gm Mike|pg||
nt|rv: Versace can play a) @CK doubleton with North b) @CKTX with North c) @CKXX with North and @CTX with South|pg||
nt|rv: gm Mike|pg||
nt|rv: only c) works here, I suspect he will play for a) or b) if he can smoke out distribution|pg||
nt|ady: even missguesing club would not have been fatal as the play went|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oosmanb:  I mean lucky*|pg||
nt|ady: now 10|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|psyck:  defense will have to help a bit, but likely down as cards are anyway|pg||
nt|psyck:  i'd assume he will take the fin if @d played now|pg||
nt|andyv:  if E shows the AK of @h, the hand will be easy for N to play|pg||
nt|danilo1: or @CA|pg||

nt|penseur9: 2@S= minors I guess|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@s a version of unusual over unusual|pg||
nt|psyck:  showing a good raise for pd here|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@S likely a limit raise or LR+ in @C.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Roland thinks it will go 1N all pass, which would send David Bird to the showers|pg||

nt|psyck: may not look for 5 card maj witrh 4333|pg||
nt|henryb:  even on a 20-20, and they should stop in 2@h I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 3@c from West looks as if 2NT was kind of Lebensohl|pg||
nt|eweber: maybe transfer to @c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|penseur9:  3@C seems indicate 0-7 with 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm told they are in 6@h on 18 next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w overboard now |pg||
nt|wstuart: Should have an easy 10 tricks on a @S lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is too good for a Roland slam|pg||
nt|penseur9: seems like 3NT again but EW this time|pg||
nt|henryb:  with all that soft stuff in the minors Garozzo should not raise|pg||
nt|danilo1: considering pass over 2@H ? ... no @S fit, too soft values in minor suits|pg||
mb|3H|nt|eweber: NS play neg. lead directing doubles from 3level if I remember their sys correctly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  3@C I meant|pg||
nt|elbec: nice choice by S who decided to pass|pg||
nt|ady: blockage problems here|pg||
nt|ady: can solve by laying down A@S    but not clear cut|pg||
nt|ady: J@D up  in fact helps|pg||
nt|psyck: no problems after winning @dJ & low @s|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play a low spade   not the 9|pg||
nt|penseur9: right to provide entry to dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: yes 9 entry for @cA|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  as the cards are both 4@s & 3N make|pg||
nt|psyck:  3N superior of course|pg||
nt|ady: not only that   but 9@S gives the defence 2 spade tgricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: typical Bergen would be 7-9, but the shape is good |pg||
nt|psyck:  3H = 5+H GF, 1-suiter or 4S-5H (was 4522 12, 2812 13, 3532 16)|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@d was no major|pg||
nt|rv: both pointed suits break beningly here, 4@s is a easy make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: being careful with 5332 is a good adjustment for "the law"|pg||
nt|ady: as long as n/s find the diamond ruff  then down 1|pg||
nt|elbec: @d lead would have easily defeated this. let's see versace's play|pg||
nt|penseur9: I agree with you both|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: if West bid bid 4@c, and it was passed out, then one can safely say that a misunderstanding has occurred  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a lot of players use Smolen here - not NS, obviously|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't see on NS card what 3@s is...looks like unspecified splinter perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: not a good start|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree also, but everyone pushes for vulnerable games|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like at least five inescapable losers|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: now down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eweber: anyone here who knows the EW system?|pg||
nt|eweber: well, I learned that they play a strong club sys, but for the XX we can only assume that it might show a half stopper|pg||
nt|rv: though Allegra lost 7 IMPs on deal 3, they had outbid their opps and would have scored plenty of IMPs if @CK was South or if @CKTX was with North|pg||
nt|andyv:  so obviously 3@s is some type of slam try...either cue bid in @s or some shortness|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Smolen would be 3@s by South to show 4@S5@h |pg||
nt|psyck:  4@d cue with fit|pg||
nt|ady: south might be worried about a club ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently they use Reverse Smolen, as they play weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: however on the lay will not have much difficulty  which ever line taken|pg||
nt|psyck: both pairs here play attitude leads|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kerasidis: i would not pass east's hand |pg||
nt|eweber: hi Bruce, hi Denis, knowing the NS pair quite well and having their system file in front of me, I join in for the purpose of answering system questions|pg||
nt|eweber: hi all|pg||
pc|c7|nt|penseur9: I guess 6@H is cold|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck:  @s for 1 loser & @h for no loser, a 67% slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would imagine the 4@s, if not kickback, would show some type of @c control|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi elke :) thank you!|pg||
nt|penseur9: 3NT should make on any lead with extra tricks possible depending on play|pg||
nt|penseur9: somebody suggest that their are only 8 tricks: not really.. 5C 2D 1H 1S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: well, that won't cause too many problems|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|wstuart: In fact, after a @S now and a @H shift by N, west will have to misguess @H not to take 10 tricks anyway.  However, he may misguess @H given the bidding.|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like leading twice toward the AQ10 of @s would be the percentage play|pg||
nt|psyck:  the double fin with low to @st the % play in @s for 1 loser|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm pretty sure 4@s was kickback and 5@d showed 2 keys|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ugis: 9 tricks possible, but must guess everything|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|ady: this not one of Cima's best hands|pg||

pc|s5|pc|hK|pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: 4@c is obviously a cue-bid in clubs, but after Bergen-style raises opener can often place the contract |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Some players I know play Reverse Transfers over 1NT. They bid 2@d, 2@H, and 2@S to play |pg||

nt|psyck:  go to vu graph room|pg||
nt|ady: there was no good reason for north to lead a diamond |pg||
nt|penseur9: our first push of the session|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rv: most purists will open 1@h with North hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Venky|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c=18-19 bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: comment that Bergen should not apply by a passed hand, but that is not set in stone - matter of partnership philosophy |pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743 for voice instructions|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Someone called Garozzo is sitting West next door. That's not THE Garozzo, is it?|pg||
nt|psyck:  click the play button next to the commentators name in the voice commentary area next to the char area|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes there was - South had the ace-king :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North couild have helped his partner on lead by doubling the 4@s cue bid|pg||
nt|wstuart: The mundane @S lead at the other table gave up an IMP.  Benito did misguess which @H honor North held;  not surprising.|pg||
nt|psyck:  can use 2@d entries for @h finesses in 4@s?|pg||
nt|henryb:  For those who don't know, Garrozzo just celebrated his 84th birthday|pg||
nt|psyck: earlier this month, 5th iirc|pg||
nt|penseur9: most amaising|pg||
nt|henryb:  He is not quite the player he was 25 or 50 years ago, but its really a case that the rest of us can now keep him in sight|pg||
nt|penseur9: they might be getting tired... the break after this round might provide a little relief|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: told yes! oh wow, Garozzo on BBO|pg||
nt|psyck:  adjust the volume sliders if rrquired|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c=55 Majors|pg||
nt|penseur9: 3@C 5-5 in majors invitational|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c shows 5-5 in the majors|pg||
mb|3N|nt|penseur9:  that was a costly misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: All our spectators just left :(|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks in diamonds the lomit if e/w get a club ruff|pg||
nt|rv: presume 2n is transfer to @ds|pg||
nt|penseur9: on board  3 the open room was down 1 on 5@S for 13 IMPs for Allegra team|pg||
nt|penseur9: echo here :)|pg||
nt|psyck: this could be another push|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes, surprising for such an experienced pair|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may make 9 tricks in either major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently Garozzo plays every day on BBO|pg||
nt|rv: will Zaleski double this to show major?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand   but someone may get overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Versace might just bid 3@s here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: over this kind of transfer. North has two bids available. He can bid either 3@c or 3@d, so some pairs use them to distinguish the kind of minor suit fit|pg||
nt|rv: if Zaleski had acted on 1n, E-W might have got to game, here I suspect they will stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: Pattacini's 1n opening might just have worked here|pg||
nt|elbec: NS open 1@d with 4@d and 5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but fairly normal to lead your own suit after the 3@C support raise  |pg||
nt|psyck:  4@h rather, as 4@s has danger of @h ruff|pg||
nt|wstuart: They may well play 4@H.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Most of the calculations of when you should push are based on playing 3 or 4 of a major. When you can stop in 2 (or in 1N as opposed to 3), the math becomes more favorable for caution|pg||
nt|penseur9: identical bidding both rooms|pg||
nt|danilo1: unpleasant bid in West's seat ... Dble with only 3@S or 3NT with 9 controls ?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oosmanb:  I mightve bid 4@d as North here, nothing to be ashamed about in that hand (except perhaps @S quality)|pg||
nt|psyck: Papi mentioned in an interview a few years ago that he is not as fast as he used to be, but those who watch him in the games he plays regularly on BBO know that he is still very ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sharp|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eweber: NS play a variable club system (Sedish style), 2@d promises 55|pg||
nt|eweber: of course South can reach N with @s then|pg||
nt|penseur9: 3nt might make buthard to bid|pg||
nt|psyck: E is endpalyed, so N's 4 loser hand reamins a 4 loser hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: be nice to have a support raise in which ever minor is better|pg||
nt|psyck:  W did not line minor holding to make a try|pg||
nt|psyck:  *like|pg||
nt|andyv:  another easy game|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@c was sort of transfer|pg||
nt|psyck:  no entry to hand for @s finesse|pg||
nt|rv: again winning decision by Versace, I might have just bid 3@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  the 3rd @h would work if he guesses|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if East might have bid directly over 1NT, rather than waiting until the bidding got to the three level?|pg||
nt|andyv:  only question is 4@s or 3N?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ugis: should go -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: take the cash|pg||
nt|psyck:  but he has lesses @d than @h & may misguess like other room|pg||
nt|rv: @CKQ in Versace may not pull too much weight since his Zaleski is predominantly showing majors|pg||
nt|psyck:  now will make|pg||
nt|rv: on this bidding, I would have just bid 3@s with West hand|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  though will make  with clubs 2-2   defence cant get do anything with high cards marked|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wstuart: 3 rounds of @C, followed by a 4th @C makes 4@H touchy.|pg||
nt|penseur9: very difficult hand to bid here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: depends if there are any limits on the 2NT bid|pg||
nt|ady: west does not like defending|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he will be disappointed to see @hAJxxx in dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as it will mean 3NT could have been defeated on a heart lead |pg||
nt|rv: declarer can potentially draw one round of @s, take @c hook and cross-ruff losing 3 @s tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eweber: sorry, Swedish of course|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wstuart: The double ruff-sluff.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: may be little swing as n/s have around 110 in diamonds    though they had got overboard|pg||
nt|psyck:  guess he wanted to see dummy 1st|pg||
nt|mdgraham: diamond needed...or at least cash a clun then switch to a diamond - otherwise, West is in with a shout  |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rv: @h switch required now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  Fantoni and Nunes had great success in a National a couple of years ago, pairs event, when they played 3NT 4 times with 5-4 major suit fit.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: wasy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: @dk duck & @c switch now maybe|pg||
nt|penseur9: that sounds good|pg||
nt|danilo1: he will not duck @DK .. take and play @D to 9|pg||
nt|henryb:  Partner's low hearts should deny anything in @d, so Madala will not be tempted to lead a low @d hoping for @dAx in partner's hand|pg||
nt|psyck: N signalled low @h for @c|pg||
nt|danilo1: if Madala plays !@C - I believe in 10|pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, 10 looks likely|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bg: first Double by W could be much weaker than his holding second pass of 2 dia  bit of an underbid some pairs might use lebensohl so that 2nt over 2dia would force a 3 club response ...|pg||
nt|bg: by W|pg||
nt|ady: if e/w defending persisted in a defence playing spades  then 3NT might have made|pg||
nt|penseur9: Garozzo has played all 4 hands to date :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: think South should have played the queen of diamonds, not the jack - if pard has underled the king, this lets him know immediately he has done the right thing - if the jack, he ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will have an anxious moment |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|danilo1: claim 10 tricks now I guess|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|rv: I saw Versace playing with Zaleski yesterday, he is playing with Lauria in OR, does that mean Duboin-Sementa not playing for Allegra?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c4|pg||

nt|psyck:  couln;t lie better for NS though|pg||

nt|ady: yes   down 2 in 4@S  in spite of the great fit|pg||
nt|ady: north double|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show two places to play, not necessarily minors|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes woth a small slam now NS|pg||
nt|wstuart: How could there ever be a swing on a deal with an 8 card suit present?  lol|pg||
nt|psyck:  :)|pg||
nt|ady: a save in 7@C   with heart ruff  1100|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: rdbl?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 6@H too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will East double.... |pg||
nt|rv: he will surely double with perfect shape and passed hand|pg||
nt|rv: partner can't misconstrue (play him for more)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, he is taking his time about it|pg||
nt|rv: E-W can score upto 11 tricks in @ds, even 3n could make unless defended very accurately|pg||
nt|mdgraham: are they using screens?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently so - thanks Roland|pg||
nt|rv: w/o @c lead, E-W can even make 6@d since @HA comes down in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|ady: south 5@C?|pg||
nt|rv: ah ok, 8 member team allowed|pg||
nt|henryb:  and the straight flush high-low virtual claim|pg||
mb|3D!|an|!S|nt|eweber: 2@h transfer|pg||
nt|psyck:  no no losing option for NS|pg||
nt|psyck:  *now no...|pg||
nt|psyck:  choice of ways for a good score, x or bid slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect someone will double this|pg||
nt|psyck:  what do you bid as W on the x?|pg||
nt|psyck:  S will be happy with opps having values in his short suit & pd showing good hand|pg||
nt|ady: south may save |pg||
nt|danilo1: 5@H/@C good .. but do not believe in it - since South will never mention @C suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, Richie, you're so old-fashioned|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, bal hand outside defensive card, short of values for vul, KQJ 6th better offensively|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: ns might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good point Mike|pg||
nt|psyck: @s lead?|pg||
nt|reisig: Right Warren :) :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: very surprising he passed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT would be nice, except that a lot of pairs play some Lebensohl-like device after the double |pg||
nt|psyck:  5@c timid there|pg||
nt|psyck:  but not clear what else he courld do|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's going to be very hard for North to bid a slam now.|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: W doesnt know if 5@d was cue or nat, so not clear what he should do now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck:  yes, I was sure of an x there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: note that East doubled 3@h at the other table!|pg||
nt|psyck:  2N nat would be nice, but surely hardly anyone plays it that way nowadays|pg||
nt|rv: I would double 3@h as well|pg||
nt|psyck:  3 is more of a problem, but with perfect hape, matx values, intermediary cards, x of 2@h was standout|pg||
nt|rv: to CK's question, I play modified lebensohl here from West hand on East's double (even if passed hand)|pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays  going down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c=GF balanced or with @cs|pg||
nt|rv: we do have Voice commentary here, Roland and team in action|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: here, double by lauria does not mean " they are cooked", it rather means " pard, i d like to go to 5@s, what do you think?"|pg||
nt|ady: dbl seems odd    when  east is on lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe he is planning to lead a cunning @S9|pg||
nt|henryb:  If Madala guesses @d, he can make this|pg||
nt|psyck: declarer prefers this lead :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@h, 1@d, 1@c if dec gets it right|pg||
nt|henryb:  Richie thinks he will go down, misguessing @d|pg||
nt|psyck: a likely possibility|pg||
nt|psyck: save was tempting, but it is just guessing at this level|pg||
nt|penseur9: except on @S lead... 13 tricks|pg||
nt|penseur9: meant @C lead sorry|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: needs  to unblock|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh wow|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   not neccessary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if he had doubled, we might be watching a contract of 2@hx - West has good trumps for a pass |pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi Richie ... rear case when do not agree with U :) ... despite voulnerability |pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  Even I would open 2@s, and I am almost as old fashioned as Richie. Without the @s9 ...|pg||
nt|reisig: Oh we ..down to 9's?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Jass-Menil |pg||
nt|warrens:  I think QJ108xx is good enough :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: 5@C was the making contract for n/s if west does not find A@H lead|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ugis: dbl with N cards surely not everybodies choice, but he was lucky not to be punished|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i am curius about the range of the 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: poor east   all the aces and kings running away|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C looks optimistic|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck:  Maybe Fantunes have some systemic gadget to do better here|pg||
nt|andyv:  good bidding into an easy contract|pg||
nt|rv: easy 9 tricks,possibly even 10 on a non @s lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  Warren you are much younger than either of us :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rv: sry 10 always|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|eweber: if they play art it might be one of those 8-11 or GF|pg||
nt|kerasidis: so unlimited|pg||
nt|eweber: I have no idea, I only know the NS system a bit|pg||
nt|kerasidis: most likely 8-11 or 14+ (12-13 would be 2NT), i am told|pg||
nt|kerasidis: but not sure|pg||
nt|rv: a few knowledgable specs are telling me they will double with East hand even on auction p-(2@h)-p-(4@h)|pg||
nt|cuan: not good lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eweber: this it what I meant with "or GF"|pg||
nt|kerasidis: an other strange|pg||
nt|kerasidis: how oja bids 6 missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hard to defend with a nine-card suit|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's not clear if NS would have been in a force over 4@D had south passed.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: well, he hasn't made it yet - but you somehow suspect that NS will be entering 1310 shoprtly|pg||
nt|reisig: :)   true|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck:  RV, my question of more where you intend to end up once pd doubles 2@h, 3N or something else|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|wstuart: That would test the agreements in many partnerships.|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||

nt|mdgraham: doubling after 2@h-4@H, I mean|pg||
nt|rv: yes, CK|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H was aloud to make on hand 21 by e/w|pg||
nt|rv: Bochhi is conserving his energy for more difficult hands|pg||
nt|psyck: they may not play tomorrow at this rate :(|pg||
nt|henryb:  kq109x|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well played, That'll teach East to open a strong NT  |pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: another slam    best played bu Fantoni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree. You don't wan't to punish partner for enterprise in getting your side involved  |pg||
nt|psyck:  sure, normal to play 3@d with passed pd|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski may get another opportunity to balance here, Pattacini would do well to raise to 3@s (tactical)|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for 3@s here with North hand?|pg||
nt|psyck:  I don't think 4@d pass would have been forcing|pg||
nt|penseur9: their will be much water under the bridge all 6 rounds of 16 boards are played out|pg||
nt|wstuart: You would have to be very confident that it was forcing. |pg||
nt|penseur9: *after all 16...|pg||
nt|rv: in my view a good strategy playing long matches|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes with 13 IMPs for Allegra on  5 where 4@S was -2 in open room|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: 3NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D=18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, does everyone open 1@C with West's hand?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psyck:  Strand preemptive style other room, 3@h last deal & Madala passed this hand opened 2@s here|pg||
nt|psyck:  *strange|pg||
nt|ritong: amusing hand for the convention|pg||
nt|ritong: from lauria's point of view|pg||
nt|elbec: how many of the kibitzers could reach 2@d contract with EW cards? :)|pg||
nt|ady: great lay here  e/w can make 3NT   but wont be in it|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: part score   diamonds  best|pg||
nt|danilo1: YES|pg||
nt|reisig: yup|pg||
nt|psyck: great suit, not rebid problem, even fits Zar count :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'll have to say NO then :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: but I do not bid as West ... Benito is adult enough - so I pass Dble|pg||
mb|d|nt|eweber: 2@s showed a good wk2 if I remeber correctly|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d 1 major & 2@s pass or correct|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psyck:  yes, nearly cold by North|pg||
nt|psyck:  4441 strong hands are tuf unless you have some methods|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2@S singleton or void|pg||
nt|danilo1: *as East|pg||
nt|henryb:  With 5-4 in the majors I have no kbjection to a to double|pg||
mb|2D|nt|penseur9:  maybe 2NT-p-3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry to slow :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: the 180 in board 4 was topped by all other tables, many downs in all EW contracts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I like 3NT directly|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is ubiquitous Gazzilli|pg||
nt|henryb:  Of course N will now bid 3@h|pg||
nt|psyck: cue primarily intended to show good hand with @d fit|pg||
nt|danilo1: Dbla as North seems automatic to me|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|eweber: maybe they changed this part of the sys or my memory is not good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I feel sorry for East. You pick up a strong notrump and score -1310, and then you pick up a Yarborough  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s by North?|pg||
nt|rv: either 5@h+4+@c 11+ or 17+any hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ugis: temting for S to go on|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful little dummy|pg||
nt|penseur9: this should be +1 while it seems that 4@S may have had a chance NS|pg||
nt|penseur9: sorry meant 4@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - but you'd be pretty certain to get the trumps wrong|pg||
nt|penseur9: good point Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless you could get some sort of count on the West hand|pg||
nt|psyck: an easy make say just giving up a @s & @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@c can be made if declarer guesses which pointed suit finesse to take|pg||
nt|psyck: @d fin risky in 5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|penseur9: I guess EW 1NT is 15-17 points|pg||
nt|rv: stronger variety is 16+any hand|pg||
nt|ady: way way overboard|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: this could upto 3 down,E-W were making 4@h though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is an old joke - what do you call AKQJxxx? Trumps  |pg||
nt|cuan: what a reopening by Manno !!!|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, was a virile reaction imo|pg||
nt|ritong: "you won t get me" he said|pg||
nt|elbec: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|psyck:  other room on the way to slam last deal|pg||
nt|penseur9: that would create a swing :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  after same bidding until 5@c...|pg||
nt|ady: can take 7 tricks    down 2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck:  N wishing he had tried 3@s instead of 3@c|pg||
nt|rv: if North's 3@s was non-forcing, Versace might have been tempted to double 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: easy to double this sitting here, far too difficult at the table:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wstuart: This wil prove to be an expensive lead|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, they were on the lighter side for their bids|pg||
nt|ady: only hope is QJ stiff hearts |pg||
nt|henryb:  We are discussing that Fantoni overcalled 1@d in the other room rather than making a T.O. double of 1@c|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psyck:  Odds of yarborough (no card higher than 9) 1:1827|pg||
nt|psyck:  if 4N is Turbo, S showed even key cards|pg||
nt|ady: best is 6NT  from north side   which can make if diamonds dont split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed - why, the opposition might even have their bids!|pg||
nt|rv: Versace will shift to @c here and not commit on defsne|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: anyone for a spade lead?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|penseur9: on  6 theOR was also in 5@C but doubled for another 7 IMPs for Allegra|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ugis: a chance now :)|pg||
nt|ugis: J of spades :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2NT may survive thanks to @DKQ sec + @S 3-3 .. if Madala reads all rite|pg||
nt|warrens:  since E has KQ of @H's, there's a very reasonable chance that the KQ of @D are onside|pg||
nt|warrens:  with West who opened the bidding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: old joke - if I'd bid diamonds, would you lead spades.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 21 Garozzo made 4@sx. Club king overtaken by the ace for a diamond switch, but now there was a ruffing club finesse |pg||
nt|rv: I presume 2n showed 5@h+4m limited range, 3@c could be relay, 3@h showed 4@d, I am guessing here:)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ugis: if E plays low...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with 1065 in spades, i'd need a good reason not to lead them - like AKQJX in hearts, perhaps  |pg||
nt|rv: I presume East has indicated no interest in @ds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: and Garozzo wasn't going to get the hearts wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h switch?|pg||
nt|andyv:  should break communication to dummy now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: @CT followed by @C3|pg||
nt|penseur9: both down 2|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rv: now @d shift for even 4 down|pg||
nt|rv: great trust in partner's carding|pg||
nt|rv: no wonder Versace is amongst top 5 players as per WBF rankings:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|iceking: 100% hann verður bestur ef hann kemur hausnum í lag hafa menn ekkert verið að fylgjast með honum þarf bara koma hausnum í lag tekur tíma þegar það gerist búmm dominerar aftur|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: so did versace, and EW won the "who pushes who" streetfight|pg||
nt|ady: should be flat    down 1 |pg||
nt|wstuart: With an impending red suit endplay on east, 9 tricks are likely now.|pg||
nt|rv: in classicial Gazzilli, 2n used to show 5@h+4@c 15-17, Madala-Bocchi are playing modified Gazzilli|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck:  hmm, E not reading cards as well as W|pg||
nt|danilo1: @Sto 8 now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|kerasidis: spades blocked|pg||
nt|penseur9:  he has to play @S now|pg||
nt|rv: good def to prevent any squeeze possibility, declarer had only 8 tricks since @cs don't break|pg||
nt|ady: hope when J@H appears|pg||
nt|danilo1: or so :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bg: better discard heart or down 3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT would have made, so this is about par for the course |pg||
nt|ritong: naturally, 2NT implied double @s stopper and @d fit|pg||
nt|reisig: @s now?|pg||
nt|danilo1: he takes K and play @H|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|psyck:  yeah, dec needed @c9 & 8 to be switch to have a chance there|pg||
nt|andyv:  S may try to cash 2 rounds of @d, one more round of @hs and throw E in with a @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will be exit with a @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  the other line of play is to exit a @s|pg||
nt|rv: with @CT set-up, defense needs only 2@s tricks to beat contract if they get red suit trick|pg||
nt|rv: best is @s exit here|pg||
nt|andyv:  right....there doesn't appear to be any line that work|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS are having a decent little run here |pg||
nt|psyck:  E does not want to let go of his lovely @s's|pg||
nt|wstuart: My guess is that he will finesse the @DQ now, win the @C return, play the @DA hoping to find the @DJ doubleton, cash a high @H, then exit with teh @DT and hope for the endplay, ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: which will work.|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam bid and nade in OR on  6 for 11 IMPs for Angelini team|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psyck:  missed one trick of @d ruff|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: North: oh, you have some spades, partner?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|penseur9: this may not work here... suspect down one|pg||
nt|psyck:  it should work as Wayne mentioned|pg||
nt|penseur9: seems I'm wrong sorry|pg||
nt|wstuart: east knows he is toast here -  the hand is a readout after North showed a singleton @S.|pg||
nt|psyck:  well, he could get everything wrong & try to drop cards, but everyone would put their money on Lauria making here :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I was thinking of a club return here|pg||
nt|wstuart: he's got to play west for the @HJ or it's all over|pg||
nt|wstuart: but there is no escape.|pg||
nt|psyck:  W knows declarers shape & values & knows he is in a hopeless position|pg||
nt|wstuart: he won't go wrong.  the chances of doubleton @HQ are *mush* smaller than finding the @DJ having to give him a @H hook.|pg||
nt|psyck:  *E knows|pg||
nt|psyck: then he is cut off after @d|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c3|nt|psyck: these low level NT contracts are simply too tuf to figure out :(|pg||
nt|warrens:  now declarer can't go wrong.  he's got a complete count on West 3226|pg||
nt|penseur9: to many ways to play them|pg||

nt|penseur9: I beleicve 4@H for NS makes here|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@C or 3@C ... believe in 1@C - but stage of the match|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: they got back 1 trick in @h suit, still lost a trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|rv: even Pattacini didn't feel like opening 1n here|pg||
nt|elbec: NS openings are usually very "sound". |pg||
nt|elbec: so i was expecting a pass by North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, You wouldn't open 2@D to say, I have 18-19 balanced, and then 2NT to say, Did you hear me, partner? I have 18-19 balanced. There has to be a good reason to bid 2NT |pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck:  overcalling|pg||
nt|andyv:  easy auction|pg||
nt|penseur9: I've been known to be wrong :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: sry, didn't see Versace's opening|pg||
nt|henryb:  The voice commenters are discussing signalling styles|pg||
nt|penseur9: they should take a short break so we get compairisions with the OR|pg||
nt|warrens:  I would not consider 3@C in first seat.  Too much danger of missing a @S game|pg||
nt|danilo1: will Benito now hide 4-card @S... guess so|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: NS is allowed to open a 14-16 NT with 5card M but this is not the hand to use such an option|pg||
nt|psyck: EW will likey sacrifice in 4@s though|pg||
nt|ady: hearts versus spades here    4@H makes    4@S a good save   may get out for down 1|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 5@C presumably pass/correct|pg||
nt|rv: since 2@s is limited to 14, Fantoni not worried about slam prospects and bid game w/o giving information to opponents|pg||
mb|d|nt|wstuart: making 3 now|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder what pass of 4@d would be|pg||
nt|psyck: if W denied @h control, 5@c will point @c weakness with E|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  Bocchi overcalled 1N here & got to 3N|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H a decent save   especially if diamond ruff not found|pg||
nt|ady: can see why west bids 3@S?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: 5@s-2 on the 6@Hx hand - 15 big imps|pg||
nt|psyck: just to show the 4th @s i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: so 5 more boards...and Monaco must hope for some big boards|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 9 top tricks if not dia led|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@s shows a rather good raise|pg||
nt|bg: great contract no play for 4 spades 3nt unbeatable|pg||
nt|ady: kibs say pass is encouraging after 3@H  |pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@H-4H|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, likely|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 2@h: I would raise 1@h to 2 with the N hand, so I would bid 2@h in response to a take out double if forced to|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kerasidis: some use bergen but it is one of the most controversial convention|pg||
nt|psyck:  exciting boards & swings, slam already bid on 4 of 7 boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that opera seems to have many fat ladies, these days|pg||
nt|penseur9: I've just been told that "Allegra", is named after the ill niece Allegra Versace of Signore Versace. She does own the trademark "Versace".|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not like bidding 2N with the E hand. I would start with 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: @s lead required to trouble declarer here|pg||
nt|psyck:  with the trump break, will still go down |pg||
nt|rv: @D9 could still get promoted here|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, likely lose 2@c, 1@h, 2@d |pg||

mb|3D|nt|ady: has west passed   not clear that Lauria would have taken action|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9: yes very|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: I'm told South has shown spades and clubs specifically - thanks|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: running scores: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|rv: similar to precision/strong @c 1M-4M which could come with upto 12-13 semi-bal hand|pg||

pc|d8|nt|psyck: 10AM CET|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck:  good chances for dec after @s shift|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|ugis: boards like this one wont help..|pg||
nt|wstuart: Note that south's 2@H bid after the 1NT overcall showed a weakish hand with some playing strength.  This is because with good hands he would either DBL 1NT or....|pg||
nt|psyck:  pessimistic lead, i would not lead the beer card unless a good reason to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s is 10-13 hcp, 5+@s as per Nunes-Fantoni's system|pg||
nt|andyv:  most texts recommend not to lead from Jxx or Jxxx of unbid suits|pg||
nt|psyck: that would probably be 4AM EST, so i'm sure tha American audience will plan to stay awake until then|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wstuart: ... bid 2NT!!  2NT would be a "cuebid" of sorts showing a highly distributional good hand which would rather play a game than defend 1NT.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: will probably run @CJ|pg||
nt|ady: still likely down 1|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ritong: oui|pg||

nt|pelu: wd by West on his minimum opening - 3@C (4. suit) from E and 3@D from W had made his life easyer|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and claim shortly thereafter|pg||
nt|penseur9:  only claimed +1|pg||
nt|rv: rare error by Versace, he needed to guess whether Zaleski had promotable @d or @SQ, tough one|pg||

nt|mdgraham: some things are pretty much a guess|pg||
nt|penseur9: same results in OR|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|ady: 3  11's    used to be a pass out|pg||
nt|ady: now way here though|pg||
mb|3H|nt|penseur9: this might give Angelini a chance for a few IMLs|pg||
nt|psyck: a chance to recover more|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: very brave 5@h bid in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck:  more swings coming as they did not get to 6@d on deal 23 other room|pg||
nt|rv: agree Mike|pg||
nt|wstuart: So, north won't run from 2@H with a misfit unless he has a self sufficient suit of his own.|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha ha ha|pg||
nt|psyck: if they find the routine 7NT|pg||
nt|danilo1: routine?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 7 may be found maybe .. but I would like to have have that routine :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|henryb:  2N = limit plus including a hand too good for a direct splinter|pg||
nt|danilo1: especially after 4@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: weak NT fopr NS|pg||
nt|ritong: a clever cue in pard's known shortness|pg||
nt|psyck: just kiddin :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|psyck: it could have just shown the @c cue that E denied having|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck:  good suit, shape, NV, etc. make is a clear opening for N|pg||
mb|5H|nt|eweber: 1@c was any 11-13 bal or a strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: this looks tough to make|pg||
mb|d|nt|bg: this should make on an endplay|pg||
nt|ady: north may lead a diamond|pg||
nt|psyck:  he is favorite to make now|pg||
nt|mathat: 11 tricks with @d|pg||
nt|danilo1: actually .. 4@D may help ... since Benito will have FREE BID to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  4333 min, will stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  though the trumps are tempting|pg||
mb|6S|nt|elbec: would 5@d have been a cost-effective solution?|pg||
nt|penseur9: sometimes you must resist temptation :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: jump to 6@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: first thing is to make @c right after the 1@c opening...|pg||
nt|eweber: 1NT 17-19 now|pg||
nt|ady: will have tp play on spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  If @c aren't 3-0, the hand is cold. If E has the 3, you will find out. and if West has the 3, you need to unblock the 8 so that you can win a second @c cheaply in the S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: ultra modern opening, ZAR point or any other hand eval system will insist you open|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's easy to say 2he shouldn't switch to a spade because that will give a trick", but that is because we see all 52 cards |pg||
nt|psyck:  Zar basically factors HCP, Shape, & Controls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s obviously forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: E's is a good opening hand for me too|pg||
nt|psyck: I'd not open NS hands though|pg||
nt|ady: this looks around down 3 vul   optimistic bidding by e/w not working well|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: i don't think so, considering how @d and @c split|pg||
nt|warrens:  hmm, West didn't consider bidding again|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck:  passing would have worked better|pg||
nt|penseur9: for sure|pg||
nt|warrens:  hard to diagnose the double fit|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|ady: hope to make 2 spades  2 hearts 3 diamonds and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|ady: playing king of spades would have been better|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: will anyone consider 4@c splinter (limited to 13 hcp or so) with South instead of 2@h followed by 3@s?|pg||
nt|wstuart: I was asked:  " is papi playing more traditional systems than he used to?  "   It depends on the partner.  Over the past 10 years I've played against Garozzo in 4 dirrerent serious ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: ...|pg||
nt|psyck:  as Oscar Wilde would say, can resist anything but temptation...|pg||
nt|wstuart: partnerships.  In all of these , he has used std initial openings, with lots of different gadgets starting in on the 2nd round of the auction.|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|penseur9: seems that fatigue is setting in|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, all roads were likely leading to 6 here|pg||

nt|psyck: Well W already doubled twice...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  easier for us to see making line :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 57 in 7 required|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H or 3NT e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: looks like a trap for EW, that one|pg||
nt|rv: 2 more sessions of finals today followed by last 2 segments tomorrow|pg||
nt|henryb:  North was looking at the @dJ, but S could comfortably have a stopper|pg||
mb|1D|nt|eweber: 46 Imps lead with only 3 boards to go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good result for EW in the other room - must have got a heart lead |pg||
nt|rv: easy 4@h here, time to grab coffee|pg||
nt|rv: in 3rd seat, 2@s is more classical|pg||
nt|psyck:  they sacced in 5@hx other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, the last time East opened a stroing 1NT he was -1310. That won't happen this time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@cx made on 24 next door. The margin is getting serious |pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
nt|rv: it is a good idea to pass with 4441 borderline hand since it is easy to get into auction later|pg||
nt|andyv:  4N by S now?|pg||
nt|rv: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but 21 shouldn't count|pg||
nt|penseur9: it does for all of us :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S confident that pd has @hs so just bids it|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since I do not think E-W open short (<3) clubs, so it is normal to play 2@c is Michaels|pg||
nt|psyck: will not be fun for whoever gets to play this deal|pg||
nt|penseur9: would you say 4@S makes for EW?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT better   not dpeendant on heart break   just not 5 cashing spades with n/s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: north might balance|pg||
nt|queequeg: Running Scores http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but we will see North's views on protection|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d shows 18-19 bal here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: that's a big order|pg||
nt|rv: Nunes's 5@s seems to be master bid (not complimentary) here|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like down 1 territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not easy vul|pg||
nt|elbec: nice stop here by EW|pg||
nt|ritong: with everything under control, if they land in some doubled @ss, north will play his trump at trick 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  what else could it mean?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT making with the lovely club position   |pg||
nt|danilo1: Well, not sure I agree with Dble on 5@H (evidently penalty) - pd bid 4@H .. maybe 6@C was better bid than Dble|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: poor suit   and poor shape |pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, sensible pass |pg||
nt|penseur9: yes looks like an easy make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however 3@C does sound rather to-play-ish|pg||
nt|psyck: surely not|pg||
nt|penseur9: two spades and a club looser|pg||
nt|psyck: @h can make 2 o/t's on non @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: predictable to play 4@H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: if playing classical Bergen, 3@d=9-11 with 4-card support. very maximum here with five trumps|pg||
nt|ady: this may well be down   |pg||
nt|ritong: same goes if they land in some undoubled @ss|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: at least East didn't pass 4@c - he has learned his lesson|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm no 4@h cue|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, we all know loonies who would bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: over 2@d, what would 3@d by East be?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: so South has done rather well here|pg||
nt|penseur9: very|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2@S should make easy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: running scores: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, actually, it was more like 2001 when I was playing against Benito and Lea about twice a week - on OKbridge then.|pg||
nt|rv: it says he is trying to mastermind the auction, Nunes has opened 2@s and has no extra redeeming feature, doesn't know what partner holds, should have passed|pg||
nt|mathat: -1or 90 % -2 10 %|pg||
nt|psyck: & @hA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: West will surely bid the slam now|pg||
nt|rv: we have ask Roland who is invisible, I don't know their sys well enough:)|pg||
nt|penseur9: I guess I'm wrong :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  a @h loser also|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck:  SLAVINSKY LEADS:|pg||
nt|psyck:  When we have one or more honours we lead in direct counting: small with an odd number of cards, high with an even number of cards.|pg||
nt|psyck:  When we have no honours we lead in reverse counting: small with an even number of cards, high with an odd number of cards.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: because you could play it as a transfer to 3@H and folow up with 3NT - but that means East declares 3NT if that is the final contract|pg||
nt|psyck:  Roland is doing voice commentary, you can see  him is using the browser|pg||
nt|psyck:  oh, the Before BBO era|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  Apparently 3@c is invitational with 6+@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be a 9 imp swing|pg||
nt|mathat: 9 or 12|pg||
nt|rv: Bocchi should avoid @d shift here|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|penseur9:  will the hand play different from E vs W in open room|pg||
nt|psyck:  10 is not considered an honour but with 10x we lead with 10.|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S started this set down 21 imps. I do not see (except from the scores) why N-S should think that they are now down 60.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck:  he had 1 extra @s & passed pd, still it is quite a view to choose to bid 5@s|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a diamond lead beats it, of course, but how can South lead that? |pg||
nt|psyck:  3@d on 2@d would be 5@s & 4@h|pg||
nt|henryb:  and another club|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: not the best switch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they have got both 3NT and 4@h declared by West, so all is well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eweber: as cards lie 3NT is unbeatable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it would be interesting to see the results of a computer simulation of 2@S by North- what the percentages are |pg||
nt|psyck:  That is NS carding style...|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|psyck:  They play similar to what W plays with Lauris|pg||
nt|psyck:  *Lauria|pg||
nt|rv: they even play in a trio sometimes rite?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck:  bascically standard count with honor & reverse count w/o...with exceptions...|pg||

pc|c3|pc|h8|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  dbl dummy, a low @h lead and @d shift would lead to down 2|pg||

nt|psyck: 4@d is all E needed to hear for 6@s|pg||

nt|ady: 6@S  sacrifice to much|pg||
nt|rv: y CK, A in longer suit better|pg||
nt|rv: 3@c by Madala is mixed raise|pg||
nt|psyck:  takes the 1 level away from opps|pg||
nt|psyck:  jump cues often played as mixed raise in competition|pg||
nt|rv: many folks play cue (good 10+) to show good raise and jump cue to show mixed raise (6-8)|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's what it looks like here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Zaleski thinking of correcting 2@h to 3@c here?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which might be rather difficult to manage now|pg||
nt|wstuart: Preemption either by the opps or by pard, as in this case.  ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: Angelini need more swingy boards than we have been getting so far this set|pg||
nt|penseur9: right you are David|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ugis: W can pass|pg||
nt|penseur9: how high will EW go?|pg||
nt|psyck: E just reconfirming suit quality|pg||

mb|p|nt|eweber: board 22 might cost some imps but as board 21 was duplicated in the closed room, I assume this match is over|pg||

nt|psyck:  2 suiter are tough to handle after 2@c, but this is too strong to try anything else maybhe|pg||

nt|psyck:  maybe 3@s was just shortness, & 5N GSF|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might get out for two down - two club finesses|pg||
nt|queequeg: at 21.15 italian time, 15.15 EST|pg||
nt|rv: I can't see Versace scoring this, good switch|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is not a good grand, however it makes.|pg||
nt|penseur9: can almost claim after getting trump out|pg||
nt|henryb:  can claim|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
nt|psyck: low level @c bids aren't normal in this age :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: is 2@C kind of Chkback (Gazzili or similar) even as passed pd? ... if natural - why 2@D|pg||
nt|penseur9: results may vary here played by South|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: sry, lost connxtn|pg||
nt|wstuart: The odds are 52% for teh @D suit to come in for no losers, plus the small chance of an opening ruff.|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm sure any grand that makes is considered good... after the fact :)|pg||
nt|rv: I am told by knowledgable specs that Lauria recently O/Ced on KTXXX, XX, XX, XXXX White vs Red|pg||
nt|psyck:  overboard here with the @h break|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c forces 2@d for various inv hands is what many play|pg||
pc|c9|nt|penseur9: welcome back :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suddenly got the White Screen of Death|pg||
nt|wstuart: The non-vul grand needs to be 56% to be break even.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: probably C!A and anothe?|pg||
nt|ritong: now versace has not led a @c yet|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: lots of messages that NS can still right-side a slam - 6@h|pg||
nt|ady: west does not have an automatic  club lead against a slam in spades|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think he will|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3@S was likely shortness?|pg||
nt|penseur9: @H jack ?|pg||
nt|psyck: nothing much else to try|pg||
nt|penseur9: agreed|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck:  we are just guessing about the bidding|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: auction sounds like a @d lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  Particularly since Lauria did not double 4@c|pg||
nt|psyck:  may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
nt|rv: this is crazy auction, 3@h and 3n were non-forcing bids from both sides, now they are in slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  it seems E's 3N should have warned W to slow down|pg||
nt|rv: Nunes's 3@h and Fantoni's 3n both can't be forcing to the best of my knowledge|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 3N was a non serious slam try, the 4@c and 4@d were cue bids|pg||
nt|mathat: fantoni nows K @s is bad card|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: sorry, @CA and another|pg||
nt|penseur9: happens to me also from time to time|pg||
nt|penseur9: we have a tye... the 3NT frtom OR went down one for 12 IMPs toAllegra|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: does not want to give an imps   being somewaht behind|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|elbec: but remember: they are Lauria Versace :)|pg||
nt|ritong: well, a @c remains possible, but versace is not threatened by a long suit or something|pg||
nt|ritong: which would call for an aggressive move|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rv: this deal is not advert for lite openings|pg||
nt|rv: now @CT?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  since E showed the K@d, W's hand improved greatly but still he needed too many cover cards from E|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ugis: So it looks like we will see Estonia battle Luxembourg for the title|pg||
nt|eweber: 4@h counts 20 points more :)|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he goes for the mundane @d|pg||
nt|mathat: in 3 @h beter to bid 4|pg||
nt|psyck:  3N just to play in this seq likely|pg||
pc|h3|nt|penseur9: *from...|pg||
nt|psyck:  they are not in G & trump not agreed yet, so it cannot be non serious|pg||
nt|rv: does 1@s double promise 4@h for Fantunes? I suspect 3n was to play and not non-serious slam try though their auction has little more merit if it was non-serious|pg||
nt|andyv:  in 3N was to play then EW were just not on same page|pg||
nt|psyck:  *in GF|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|elbec: 12 easy tricks for NS|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|psyck:  EW were headed to some negative score anyway, where playing on some contract going down or defending a making contract|pg||
nt|ady: safe to lose heart to west with 10@S in south hand and 9 in north hand|pg||
nt|penseur9: making now|pg||
nt|psyck: a @s trick lost, so comfy|pg||
nt|danilo1: after @HJ making|pg||

nt|mdgraham: very shapely deal.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as you said, Venky, not an advert for light openings|pg||
nt|rv: 2 more segments after this rite?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and West gets another chance....|pg||
nt|psyck:  ye, today|pg||
nt|ady: very likely to be flat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another likely 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: ah, we may start having compairisons soon with or|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now that N hand is what I think a weak 2@s looks like :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: the last few boards have been what a team with a big lead must be wishing for: quite boring|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: amusing auction next door. Everybody bid suits they haven't got |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, the previous opening was AAK. |pg||
nt|rv: just 25 IMPs, still enough boards for Val Di Magra to turn this around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s?|pg||
nt|henryb:  If I thought I were well ahead, it would not occur to me to act with the E hand|pg||
nt|psyck:  not going well for Angelini this set at all, they are in 6@s other room here|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s could be @s+minor if it is popular Woolsey|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ugis: Does anyone know at what time will the final start?|pg||
nt|queequeg: this is the last board of the Semifinal. The final will be Luxembourg-Estonia|pg||
nt|queequeg: 14.30 italian time|pg||
nt|queequeg: 8.30 EST, 13.30 UK|pg||
nt|ugis: thx :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when you hold the South hand, partner usually bids 3@c - and East doubles for penalties |pg||
nt|mdgraham: take care of the tens, and the ones can take care of themselves|pg||
nt|ady: needs a spade lead to defeat 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It will be interesting to see if North chooses 6@S or 6NT |pg||
nt|penseur9: Open Room OR that is|pg||
nt|mathat: yes @s +min|pg||
nt|mathat: 6 NT by S|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S makes n/s   either spades 2-2    or diamond finesse|pg||
nt|ady: fair shot from east   especially state of match   |pg||
mb|d|nt|elbec: would u overcall 2@d with E cards?|pg||
nt|penseur9: at the rate the OR is playing, Roland might again ffinish the voice commentaries in the OR again today|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 4@s|pg||
mb|r|nt|mdgraham: EW can make 3NT here - nine toppers. The power of aces (and, of course, the odd solid seven-card suit)  |pg||
nt|penseur9: That is a very light opening for East|pg||
nt|ady: with the clubs rinning for 5 tricks  cannot get any sort of decent penalty from 1NT    in fact may well make|pg||

nt|andyv:  4@s practical|pg||
nt|mathat: practical bid|pg||
nt|rv: same comment by 3 of us, how frequent it is on BBO:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow, almost unanimous in the practical department|pg||
nt|psyck:  maybe, but N's @s could be better on a good day|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this will be another double digit loss for the angelini team|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i would raptorize it:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, so much for 3NT :)|pg||
nt|ady: south has been there before   looking at 2 low clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Not wild abt 3@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe just shows six spades|pg||
nt|reisig: and 2@s showed 5?|pg||
nt|ady: slam even around 50 percent if played by east|pg||
nt|ritong: google "raptor bridge" if you want to know more about it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ugis: well, somehow the timetable on the web is wrong for this particular tournament :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S must have shown a fragment - can't really be natural, given the 3@D bid. Might have bid 4@H as well|pg||
nt|rv: 4@s is make here, 5@h would be 2 down|pg||
nt|psyck:  This session has been a quiet low scoring one so far, there were slams & doubled games every other deal previous session|pg||
nt|penseur9: 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|penseur9: hands I should say|pg||
pc|s2|nt|queequeg: that could be because they changed the times last minute|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even +1 on the double club hook|pg||
nt|penseur9: I can't figure this one out :(|pg||

nt|rv: at these colors, you always think/assume opps are saving w/o values|pg||
nt|psyck:  he just doubled to keep me happy|pg||
nt|rv: E-W make upto 11 tricks in @s strain|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mathat: maybe play x@c|pg||
nt|henryb:  safest play is just to drive the high clubs|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck:  hmm, now he will make 11|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, but East is on lead|pg||
nt|ady: Valdemagra have picked up 20 imps in 2 recent hands|pg||
nt|ady: slam was missed on hand 27th|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and they led a club, too|pg||
nt|penseur9: this lead should make life easier for declarer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eweber: last board for this half at this table while the other room is playing board 8 right now|pg||
nt|kerasidis: last board now ty elke bruce and all kibbs|pg||
nt|kerasidis: and of course our operator|pg||
nt|eweber: and you :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|ady: right to be worried    apart from diamond finesse needed if north on lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  & did not want to risk it with the lead likely marked|pg||
nt|psyck:  w/o the @c he would have happily taken 10|pg||
nt|rv: CK, South will be caught in minor suit squeeze in any case rite?|pg||
nt|rv: even on best defense, Zaleski would have made an OT|pg||
nt|psyck:  inddded, looks like there was a showup|pg||
nt|mathat: nows S the Garozzo hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the values are all certainly marked|pg||
nt|mathat: and 4-4 th minors after the lead|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes...king, club ruff, trumps? |pg||

pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||

mc|9|nt|ugis: not anymore|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Halsall?|pg||

nt|rv: N-S playing strong @c?|pg||

mb|p|nt|reisig: hmmm 1NT?|pg||
nt|reisig: whew :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  If I bid 4@s here, my partner would have x/Axxxx/xxx/Axxx|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@c is either 16+ or natural (or both)|pg||
nt|psyck: should end here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maybe 1@s - Pass 1nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's better|pg||
nt|reisig: what now?|pg||
nt|reisig: Maybe X...or Pass|pg||
nt|ady: best to forget the diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck:  now everyone wants to do something, just don't know what|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@c possible|pg||
nt|ady: naybe 2NT   clubs or diamonds?|pg||
nt|henryb:  they have been discussing whether Cappelletti or DONT is worth|pg||
nt|henryb:  worse|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2NT I think is LR+ with 3+ trumps.  3@D shows bal with extra values.|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@d = not min ..not slam|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are even on @c lead double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: maybe|pg||
nt|ady: may find difficulty in bidding to 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes good point|pg||
nt|rv: coffee deal here, all games make|pg||
nt|penseur9: good stop|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: although with three smnall spades and two small hearts, colour me chicken|pg||
nt|psyck:  will S try looking for 3rd round control in @c?|pg||
nt|rv: South could have splintered with 3@s, then on 4@d can blackwood though all roads lead to GS|pg||
nt|danilo1: good pass by West|pg||
nt|psyck: W showed his limit raise hand & had no extras|pg||
nt|penseur9: exactly|pg||
nt|psyck: 4333, aceless secondary values, dubious @d's etc|pg||
pc|d5|nt|elbec: Now Val di Magra is only 18 IMPs behind Allegra team|pg||

nt|penseur9: everything appears to be sitting favourably here|pg||
nt|psyck:  This is the 58th Italian Championship for Garozzo i'm told.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Dear Bill, please look at my partner's probable hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think if S had bid 3@s, West would have bid 4@c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: 1@c is 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced. Not sure what the double implies|pg||
nt|psyck:  6@c after RKC response may ask for 3rd round control...|pg||
nt|rv: South's worry for GS will be North holding 3rd round control of @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 5@D now to check on @hQ|pg||
nt|rv: South still needs to find out both @HQ as well as 3rd control @c control, maybe he will chance GS even w/o explicit 3rd round control|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: yes - 33 imps in 3 boards!|pg||
nt|henryb:  but with 3-3 spades, there is no particularly good reason to avoid 3N|pg||
pc|hK|nt|penseur9: however, to make 54 IMPs in last 4 hands for Val Di Magra appears next to impossible|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, no slam makes on @c lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: that 6@H jump probably denies any side king|pg||
nt|rv: as a few knowledgable specs point if North showed @HQ with 5n, then South could have still bid 6@c|pg||
nt|psyck:  S will have to gamble on 3rd round @c control now|pg||
nt|rv: some play 5n response to queen ask to show 2 side kings and @HQ|pg||
nt|psyck:  5N would be showing trump Q & unshowable K's for some|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, more efficient to use 5N as showing the queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  bye|pg||
pc|sK|nt|penseur9: bye Henry|pg||
nt|rv: this deal would be lot more interesting in MPs or BAM scoring, deal to relax in IMPs scoring|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck:  likely the unbalanced variation as N chose 3@c|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck:  either unshowable or 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|rv: wd, though not a very elegant auction,unlike in Gymnastics bridge doesn't have points for artistry:)|pg||
nt|rv: artistry is judged only prizes for best played, defended, bid hands are awarded in bridge:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: as a spec says, hurrah for the jack of spades|pg||
nt|ady: this could be a swing back to the leaders|pg||
nt|ady: not sure how each e/w knows of 3 spades with partner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if this makes, South will kick himself  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: trump nest|pg||

nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|wstuart: Contrast this to leading the @SJ first, then east would have to overtake any @S on the 2nd round - had trumps been 4-0, he would have to waste an entry to get back to dummy to play ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: a 3rd @S.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Bocchi reasonably treated his hand as worth 16+|pg||
nt|ady: heart game n/s|pg||
nt|warrens:  good A of @C by North. otherwise the @C trick goes away on the @D's|pg||
nt|danilo1: even 2@H down ... would it not be better for East to wait one round with unobvious bid? ... he may get mor infos|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: incidentally even in OR, famed Bocchi-Madala pair didn't bid GS very scientifically, they also bid it w/o asking for 3rd round @c control|pg||
nt|ritong: three comparisons left for this segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Not exactly a low scoring set: 86 imps in 13 boards|pg||
nt|penseur9: very good point Wayne|pg||
nt|rv: yes, Allegra would start favorites in any World Champs:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb:  George, your partner made a vul overcall. Do you really think it is likely that the opponents, who died at 3@h, have a vul game? I would not|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ9+AKQ+AQ10xx+xx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when your opponents bid a laydown grand slam there is nothing you can do but hope that your teammates bid it as well|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d, 18-19 bal once again|pg||
nt|rv: Zaleski has a problem here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s-2N-pass?|pg||
nt|psyck:  with @d's coming in, 4@s should make here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: part score this time   around 10 tricks in diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@C probably a catch-all for EW, as they play a strong NT   |pg||
nt|reisig: 3NT|pg||
nt|reisig: everyone agree 1@h ?|pg||
nt|psyck:  he will surely not pass 2N|pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps for the leaders on hand 29   part score in clubs open room|pg||
nt|ritong: then, a last set of 16 boards to decide who will play in the final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South did indeed bid 3@S directly at the other table, and bought the contract |pg||
nt|psyck: this hand will require right @h guess too|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb:  Roland, would you like to be in this grand?|pg||
nt|henryb:  not that bad: just need hearts and to guess the @c|pg||
nt|danilo1: not pleasant rebid for West|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  1@h not my style|pg||
nt|elbec: brave reopening by Lanzarotti|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: this hand is an excellent lesson|pg||
nt|henryb:  and 6@h is not that bad really, especially with a @s lead|pg||
nt|jcwla:  http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202009-08.aspx |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: when you have no clear reason to think your side might make a game contract, just give up early, even in a known 4/3 major fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much that West can do here, it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  you think W won't need to finesse for the J@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: running scores: http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|psyck: Grand is too good for Roland here, he only needs 12.89% or better (does not bid slams requiring 3 finesses)|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess 2@C conv.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|reisig: I bid 1NT = bal|pg||
nt|psyck:  Ace & a 5 carder &  a 4 card maj|pg||
nt|psyck:  yeah well, what do i know|pg||
nt|rv: I presume 2@d opening denies 5M|pg||
nt|mathat: if the lead is @d and nows the @h 2-2 beter to play 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Hedy thinks N should let them play. But as the saying goes, "Why should they go down when we can?"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 2@S, but no guarantees - and it wil be a 4/3 fit|pg||
nt|psyck: Gazzilli style maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: yes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fulldire: no GaRzilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no, prefer 1NT. |pg||
nt|reisig: 3@s ..end???|pg||
nt|psyck:  wow, they bid better than us :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hmm. Something has Happened|pg||
nt|reisig: not likely|pg||
nt|reisig: that 3@s ..was 3NT"|pg||
nt|rv: that makes his pass a lot easier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h-2@S-2NT would be an invite with four spades - East probably didn't think he was worth the invite |pg||
nt|psyck:  He has limited entries for finesses, will just play for drop or ruff it out|pg||
nt|rv: Fantoni's pass is bit timid in my view, he should atleast try for game with 3@c|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@c was the choice other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: aha|pg||
nt|psyck:  aaah, more like it|pg||
nt|rv: if that option was available, I might have taken it|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Over 1NT a popular method is to preaccept a xfr by bidding a doubleton.  Over 2NT, however, many prefer to cuebid a side source of tricks when preaccepting a xfr.|pg||
nt|psyck: Indeed :)|pg||
nt|fulldire: this is the new name|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: more like it    but likely to go down|pg||
nt|fulldire: very similar to Gazzilli in any case Benito already played gazzilli before gazzilli playing roman club with belladonna|pg||
pc|c8|nt|penseur9:  I'm one of them|pg||
nt|psyck:  but non vul & their bids already limited in their system (they both had max for their bids)|pg||
nt|psyck:  E's hand still too tempting not to try|pg||
nt|rv: Fantoni had already shown 14+ with his choice of opening in their system, a few kibs feel he did have a case for passing in his system|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck:  and 1@s limited it to about this strength|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@H was (obviously) a re-xfr.|pg||
nt|danilo1: well ,,, not yet made after @C lead ... will need to guess @H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|penseur9:  they ask the more experienced :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i would have certainly invited at least, & 3N would have made here on normal @s lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|psyck:  played by W, could have got a @s lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: atleast 9 tricks now w/o @d shift|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: tried to pin stiff J@D|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|penseur9:  Please adress your written questions to me please|pg||
nt|psyck:  oh, but not in that sequence|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: if west decides to fight, it would be via 2@h i think  passing 1@s already indicates 3+ cards|pg||
nt|ritong: and very likely exactly three|pg||
nt|henryb:  once you guess clubs you get 4 club tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: next case|pg||
nt|fulldire: in the system Benito and I we developed is written "GaRzilli" |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|psyck:  S would be on lead then & lead @d|pg||
nt|fulldire: I think Benito should claim also for this convention|pg||
nt|psyck: After all the system inventions he has done, least that can be done is to honor a convention with his name|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|pc|s6|nt|rv: in conventional std 1@d-1@s-2n, East had a easier pass|pg||
nt|rv: here Zaleski had to guess to an extent, not all modern systems/conventions always work out:)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|psyck:  dec seems to have gotten the cards right in other room playing 4@s|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s9|nt|andyv:  hard to stop the trump promotion unless you play toward !ks and @s back|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|penseur9:  Reading has one drw back... takes the eyes from the play|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: spec informing me of other conventions named after him...|pg||

nt|ady: south 2 suits both spliting 3-3|pg||
nt|fulldire: there are many the most important is the "GAR" also if few people play that therefore is not knowned as it is the drury or stayman for example|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: a nice 12.9% slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: This will be the last hand in the CR...  More great bridge comming with 4 more rounds tomorrow and the last on Sunday... hope to see you all here then|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@d = 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|psyck:  upgraded with good 5 carder & controls|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha right one more round after this sorry|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 more boards and the Angelini team will get a much needed break.|pg||
nt|warrens:  well done by both declarers. played S to have either the A of @h's or the K of @S's|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck:  1 more deal , yes|pg||
nt|psyck:  next round at 9:15AM CET|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland would leap into it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpt: segment 2 start in 21.15 local time|pg||
nt|henryb:  So we can predict based on trends that there will be 13 imps scored on these last two boards|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerability wrong for a n/s save|pg||
nt|ritong: an other good lesson|pg||
nt|henryb:  Unless there is a large unexpected swing on this board, "The fat lady just sang!" :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: you're so generous :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: go quiet with no sure fit, go wild with sure fits, especially @ss|pg||
nt|psyck:  sorry, 10AM CET|pg||
nt|psyck: will S look for a 5 card maj with N or just bid 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: rehi, sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW might get to 4@S here |pg||
nt|penseur9: with 2 boards left to play, it's reasonable to say that the Allegra team will be in the finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: 5 @c -1 for EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  The most extreme case I say of a "5 or 7 hand" was a "2 or 7 hand" in no trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: 5@c are really too many...|pg||
nt|ady: on the lar can make 12 tricks in spades or diamonds   but likely settle for game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: it should go down though|pg||
nt|henryb:  Over 14 boards, 90 imps have been scored, which is almost exactly 6 1/2 a board. So I predict another 13. :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Benito is ready to leave :)|pg||
nt|psyck: this will be as successful as the other room|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: The required rate has gone back to about 2imps per board from 1 imp per board earlier|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psyck:  yes, would have had some chance only if played by W & lead not found|pg||
nt|psyck:  a muiderberg style 2@s opening would have worked better this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 2@s opener, EW had a better chance of reaching 5@c|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck:  enabling EW to find 5@c|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|penseur9: another way to say it Mike :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at a cautious guess, yes. Well done to them. They have played very well this set |pg||
nt|penseur9: On hand 11 where we were in 7@D here makink the OR played 3NT+4 for 14 IMPs for Allegra|pg||
nt|penseur9: making even :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|reisig: 4@s ..wow|pg||
nt|reisig: 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: gosh, 4@s. Going it a bit|pg||
nt|psyck:  4@s= I have 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|ritong: feeling protected with odds, henry?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two hearts and a diamond to lose?|pg||
nt|elbec: 5 imps coming....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: awkward on repeated heart leads|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rv: 2@h is retransfer back to @s?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: this  can make if Verace gets diamond position right  and no heart lead|pg||
nt|elbec: only @h lead...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed. Nothice that 5@c is down 2 on a @d lead|pg||
nt|psyck: a couple of good boards could still change everything & anything is still possible|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: with trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now just hammer away with hearts|pg||
nt|elbec: nicely done Lanzarotti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: so what do we know?|pg||
nt|ritong: south has cards, more or less balanced|pg||
nt|ritong: north has a bunch of @cs|pg||
nt|fulldire: if west put the King of @H in dummy he makes|pg||
nt|fulldire: now 1 off|pg||
nt|ritong: and probably a high card onside, like the @d K|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think North's invitation is minimum, and South's accept is not even close|pg||
nt|penseur9: very well indeed|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks  if not cashing clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: 13th on this lead|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ritong: so if north is singleton @h we are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: And in all the other sets too, come to that |pg||
nt|ady: be a top in mp pairs for e/w if cashing the clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|reisig: That bid NEVER entered my mind :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: hence, playing the @h K was highly possible|pg||
nt|ady: now 13 tricks   |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|queequeg: the next round is starting at 14.30 italian time, 13.30 UK, 8.30 EST|pg||
nt|rv: some play lead of King or Ace and shifting to short suit shows stiff and leading other honor and shifting shows doubleton|pg||
nt|fulldire: not easy but possible expecially for versace depend on lead how they lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: stil  needs @DK down in three, for the heart discard from dummy - which it does|pg||
nt|penseur9: right you are|pg||
pc|sA|nt|penseur9: is everybody holding their breath here :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Making 7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|rv: this distinction will help partner in ducking when appropriate, doesn't matter here|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  If Versace leads a low @d, N has to grab the K and lead a second @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  But then there aren't enough trumps|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, squeeze|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck:  E promised a big hand, but as you say, with 4333, it was certainly aggresive|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: nice phrase, Krishna - "certainly aggressive". We know what you mean :)  |pg||

nt|queequeg: the next Vugraph will be at 14.30 CET, 13.30 UK, 8.30 EST, ALLEGRA-VAL DI MAGRA again|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have noticed that vocalists consistently ignore all writers|pg||
nt|ritong: he likes his hand|pg||
nt|psyck:  all those @c bids should prvent the lead, time to bid slam :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: they seem to be going for it|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, another chance for a pickup|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  back in about one hour and 40 minutes|pg||
nt|penseur9:  upon return we will have the other semi final here|pg||
nt|rv: can declarer cross ruff and still get home after losing trick to @SK?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@c or 5@d are just as unbeatable|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Nice hand to bid with ...over X :)|pg||
nt|ady: just what Fantoni wanted to hear|pg||
nt|psyck:  on a more serious not, 3@c may show partial stop|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: I would like to thank all the commentators, to numerous to mention for doing a fine job|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: thanks all, bye|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck:  this match is closer of the two SF's|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|rv: this lead should give more than fighting chance for Pattacini|pg||
nt|psyck:  So we will see them again next session|pg||
nt|ritong: i think it is better that way, henry|pg||
nt|ritong: we probably should do same.|pg||
nt|ritong: and, in a smaller world, have a glass together afterwards:)|pg||
nt|penseur9: the finals will start in about two and a half hour... don't miss it|pg||
nt|wstuart: Usually, 3@C shows extra values without a more clear bid.|pg||
nt|ady: should Laria done more with 2 aces|pg||
nt|danilo1: Thanks all|pg||
pc|hT|nt|wstuart: Often it will contain 3@C and highlight @H (opener's suit) as a potential weakness.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: good 3NT bid - West knows East has a diamond fit |pg||
nt|penseur9:  I wish to thank Mike Graham my co commentator|pg||
nt|penseur9:  bye bye all|pg||
nt|henryb:  Notict that they do not have a wasted J|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|reisig: Any bets on the lead?|pg||
nt|psyck:  maybe both think they are showing partial stops|pg||
nt|fulldire: bravo benito|pg||
nt|penseur9: we hope the more then 2000 spectators (I don't like the word kibbitzers (sorry)) will join us again for the final round... they REALY keep us on our toes... thank you|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: I suspect 1 down here|pg||
nt|wstuart: He may well avoid a @C lead on this hand - east may think @Hs is the likely weakness.|pg||
nt|wstuart: West, I mean|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  Well, Roland, in the previous sessions that I have done with both forms, any thanks to writers has only come after prompting|pg||
nt|reisig: Automatic ....for him !|pg||
nt|wstuart: nice|pg||
nt|mathat: if Bocchi RDBL=A or K @h madala play 4 @h and made|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rv: sry once declarer loses trick to @SK, no real chance for making|pg||
nt|psyck:  well, at least this tightens up the match|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes, |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: on a very good day, 6@d would have made here, not today as it is down on a @h lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: if Pattacini had played @s to @SA, he might have scored especially on @DJ lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  oh oh|pg||
nt|wstuart: West had the info that east didn't overcall 1@H over 1@D, so his @H can;t be all that great.|pg||
nt|reisig: No comment|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes but a 28 -18 score for 16 hands is certainly tight scoring|pg||
nt|psyck:  we will leave the last comment at good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: segment 4 start at 17.10 local time|pg||
nt|penseur9: OK some suggest I say KIBS, I'll buy that :)|pg||
