nt|vugraphzns: play starts, so i give the answer. It was Agustin Madala :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: 1@C is clubs, or balanced 10-13/17-18. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 2@C seems pretty quiet on the South cards.  I guess he is waiting to see what E-W think they can make, and then he can bid one more.|pg||
nt|sybarra: video coverage can be found at www.wkbridge2011.nl/en|pg||
nt|brolucius: North did not open at the other table. (You can see the other auction by putting your cursor on the Closed Room result, top left.)|pg||
nt|kit: And now he has to follow through and bid that one more.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think I would have been in 4@C about 2 rounds of bidding sooner, but this was effective.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C showed minimum of three cards in the suit, so South knew of at least 9 trumps. |pg||

mb|4S|nt|kit: In closed room E-W took decent save vs. 4@H.  Doing same here it looks like.|pg||
nt|jbennet: p has shown intersest in competing|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H shows diamonds and spades, specifically. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think with Qxx of spades Hurd should have doubled.|pg||
nt|kit: And AKxx of other suit.  Pass is just asking partner do to the wrong thing.|pg||
nt|jbennet: so by bidding 4cl p might even find a D on 2 sp, (knowing wests side=D)|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: 2@h already showed @s and @d|pg||
nt|kit: The more I look at it, the more surprised I am by the pass.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can hardly bid 5@H, can he? He does not know of heart support. |pg||
nt|kit: And I wouldn't blame Wooldridge for bidding 5@C here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: suppose 2H can also be H + C|pg||
nt|brolucius: No. I have their card.|pg||
nt|jbennet: so south cornered himself by not bidding 4 clubs when he had the chance|pg||
nt|007 joosth: S  sorry|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|d|nt|kit: In fact 5@C can make with good view in club suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: But 5@H goes down on singleton club lead, or shift.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: West can lead @SK, asking for a count signal, so he knows how many cards will cash.|pg||
nt|jbennet: 1 main issue in this game is to anticipate coming nasty decisions to make.|pg||
nt|brolucius: @SA would ask for an attitude signal, as most pairs play it.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbennet: and to act in such a way that simplifies decision making.|pg||
nt|jbennet: south did not do that. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Almost everyone plays that way at the five-level or higher. Some play 'ace for attitude, king for count' throughout.|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like this should be suit-preference, since count known from the bidding (or is it?)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, club shift should be trivial to find.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|jbennet: so south unlucky to find p with dead meat??|pg||
nt|kit: On this hand due to the entry problem a diamond shift works also, but West doesn't know the full club layout|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|kit: However East pretty much has to have an ace to justify the double, so club looks right.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jbennet: so north might x 4sp?? perhaps |pg||
nt|jbennet: but|pg||
nt|kit: But will declarer believe this has happened?  He might not get the clubs right.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The club ruff is lost and declarer now has a chance.|pg||
nt|kit: East might lead a club now, putting it to declarer|pg||
nt|jbennet: south didnt act over 3 sp. So how could north pssibly know that south was going to mastermind the board for himself|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: Moment of truth.  I think declarer should have led high heart from hand, trying to presrve dummy entries|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: Well, looks like Wooldridge is getting it right.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbennet: oh dear east coverred.|pg||
pc|d4|mc|11|nt|brolucius: Declarer knows from West two-suited overcall that he will be short in clubs. However, he did not switch to the singleton club, so that looks a bit strange to declarer.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@H  clever  preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sorry  Grue 3@H = Michaels|pg||
nt|ady: good chance of 4@H making     4@S  a save|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rhelle: 4@s now?|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand 3@H   for e/w|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: unusual 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass from west at green - must be inconvenient for his system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump cue = mixed raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mixed =  shapely hand too good for simple raise, not good enough for invitational raise|pg||
nt|ady: does not seem to good for a simple raise for me|pg||
nt|ady: not clear cut for north to go as far as 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: they open some wierd shapes david|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: early diamond leads might make 4@H tricky  as taking entries out for later safety in clubs|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: if Verhees held 6 or 7 @H, he might have pulled the DBL  [maybe via 4N]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if vanProoijen wanted Verhees to overtake, would play @DA THEN @HJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: example   if he held  @SQx  instead of Qxx|pg||

mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|brolucius: A huge swing on getting that defence right. And two chances were missed.|pg||

nt|jbennet: another example of how bidding have been much more agressive and also more sophisticated over the years.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brolucius: The Dutch team psychologist (if they have one) will have told his lads not to let one very bad board affect their play on the next board or two. Oh yes? Easy to say.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of 1@C rather than 1@D    system must dictate the opener with 44 minors|pg||

nt|sybarra: lots of questions re the pass of 1 nt by N on first board,  anyone have any insights? |pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I do|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 - 15. North has 10, with a 3343|pg||
nt|roswolf: it does show that everyone is watching carefully:)|pg||
nt|harmon: only chance to beat this is with swindle win 1st dwith ace|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|rhelle: so a max of 25, and the risk of going off in 2NT for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx that should settle the cannibals down|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd pass that hand as well|pg||
nt|ady: Netherland may lose around 6 on hand 17  where they stopped in 1NT  with 25hcp|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up club suit for 1 loser playing west for 1 high hnor and 10   doubleton|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: 1@S-2@S = 4-fit   1@S-2@D=art invite maybe 3-fit|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|ady: and heart position favourable|pg||

nt|ahollan1: either way  Muller figures to hold @HA|pg||

nt|roswolf: bd 1 team orange tried 5@C-3 for a 2 imp loss|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 6@C  good contract   but fails on bad trump split|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you look at the NS hands of board 17 in isolation, and you'd give a score in a bidding competition, you score 10 for 1NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c: you have a sure @d loser, and a 2nd @s loser if the @dA is wrong. So not so great ...|pg||

nt|rhelle: now declarer has some problems, and needs to start looking for his 9th trick|pg||

nt|rhelle: I'd say, start by setting up a 2nd @s trick and advance the @s J|pg||
nt|ady: K@D best chance  |pg||
nt|ady: I think needs an error in defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: East has to duck, otherwise you have another entry to dummy|pg||

nt|sybarra: but so much easier from this vantage point, dont you think?|pg||
nt|ady: wests play of 10@H  seems odd    maybe a view graph error|pg||
nt|rhelle: Declarer has noted the @h discard on the 1st @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no error, W started @H 10...|pg||
nt|ady: well seems to be an error in defence  10@H lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: Where are the points? the 3rd hand 1@h doesn't promise the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Muller thinking of every possible distribution,  knowing the @C and (maybe) hts|pg||
nt|frankaus: even from  up here the way forward is not clear|pg||
nt|frankaus: all the kibs and gib make it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller is trying to work out why East played @H9 at Trick 1. With QJ98x, East would overtake @H10, in case it was a singleton.|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer seems to have 9 tricks; 3@c, 2@d, 2@h, 2@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: but how to get them before the defence has 5?|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome petergill|pg||

nt|brolucius: Neither is attractive at all. OK from a 5-card suit, but likely to give away half a trick on average. Not worth it when you have only a 4-card suit to establish.|pg||
nt|jbennet: defenders have only 16 points so the ZIA:s rule outweighes|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an|2+|mb|p|nt|jbennet: infact there was a strong case for putting in the Jack,|pg||

nt|kit: In essence, same auction at both tables (Precision 1@D start).  But played from opposite side.|pg||
nt|sybarra: just a question,  what was wrong with playing 1 nt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: 2@c two-way checkback|pg||
nt|brolucius: No doubt a direct bid of 2@D from Brink would have been a further enquiry (check-back).|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011  for live video. Turn sound off if you want to listen to the BBO commentators instead (we hope you do :))|pg||
nt|kit: 2@D figures to be better on balance opposite what is basically a weak notrump without 4 hearts.  I agree with choice.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|kit: sorry, same side.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kit: In other words, if partner opened a weak notrump an you had to choose between playing 1NT or 2@D (let's say 2@C were a transfer), surely you would transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: suggested that the player know that David does not like watching 1 nt hands LOL|pg||

nt|kit: why?  They might have had 5-4 diamond fit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Impossible to find the meaning of 2@C on their convention card. Like looking for an ant on a 1-acre carpet.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm pretty sure it forces 2@D|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if 5-2 diamonds they have a retreat to 2H which seens nice|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, forces to 2@D, which he can either pass or use as a spring-board for some try elsewhere.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|nt|jbennet: if 2clubs had been checkbak. (p to bid 3 card heart suit if he has.|pg||
nt|kit: Those of you who are criticizing getting to 2@D are just resulting in my opinion.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rhelle: I agree with Kit|pg||
nt|rhelle: If they play 2-way checkback(highly likely), 2@c is a transfer to 2@d, and after that every bid is an invite|pg||
nt|grebrof: throwing the @c wasnt the best idea here|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@d = artificial, GF. Says nothing about @d|pg||
nt|kit: The club discard is going to look might strange to declarer, that's for sure.   Of course, remember East hand concealed so Wooldridge did have a problem.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|petergill: 3@S was mildly conservative, after S's weak raise. 4@S was possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try 5@C which will discourage Bathurst from bidding more|pg||
nt|ady: sorry folks  have connection problems|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is easy, and 5@D looks OK, but if N doubled 3@C (t/o) to try to get to 3NT, S might pass and 3@CX would be cheap save|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: it did and anothe 13 imps to team america as i predicted:)|pg||
nt|ady: last hand bad for USA   3 hearts could have been beaten and 3@S making|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: very controlled auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  Puppet 2@D   a) to play 2@D  b) some invitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Have to pick @SQ (unlikely but not impossible) to make 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  Grue also in 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: In 2@D, Joe Grue will not go -4, more like -200, I predict|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's part of  2-Way Checkback   aka  2-Way NMF   aka XYZ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rhelle: the 3@h bid proved very effective in stopping EW reach their cold game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but XYZ applies in other sequences that don't end in 1N|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: 4@S   good contract    case for west to try 4@S    though cant say automatice|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: Other room also in spade partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: West could have played @SJ instead of the third @d, to escape for -200, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue in same end position in 2@D  so -400 probably a push|pg||
nt|petergill: with trumps 4-1, declarer will need absolutely inspired play to make this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller thinks there was a break in tempo |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and asked for a director|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North didn't see it|pg||
nt|petergill: Easy for us with all 52 cards visible, but almost impossible to make 6@D looking at 26 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: before the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinks it was the fastest bid he made in the auction..|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20 was pushed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst leaves to the toilet now|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   alert 10-15 pts   4+ diamonds??|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North alerted it like that|pg||
nt|ady: may not be good news when he returns|pg||
nt|petergill: We all saw for ourselves how long it took for S's 5@D - though if we were all polled, we would estimate different amounts of seconds - such is the nature of human memory.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: not the dummy I Hoped|pg||
nt|ady: so some sort of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S denied @H control  so Zagorin 5@C not only shows the @C void but ALSO @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Think south decided to show his hand like this..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I couldn't read SW explanation|pg||
nt|petergill: If S did have a 4th @D, then 6@D would be a decent contract. |pg||
nt|rhelle: so, single dummy, how to play this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver start with 1@D [usually 5+]  -  2@C Relay, INV+|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 top tricks. Where to find 3 more, and lose only 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin doesn't know how to play yet, according to his body language|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither do we|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe take the ace, @h to the 9?|pg||
nt|rhelle: aiming to ruff 2 @h in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe he has a chance. Does the 3@C overcall suggest @SQ? More importantly, if East turns up with 4 @D's and 3 @hs when KQ drop and obv only 2 @C's then @SQxxx onside cannot be ...|pg||
nt|petergill: picked up for 4 tricks so the only hope might be Qx doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to think of the hand as if you were at the table and DO NOT know @SQ falling doubleton|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla:  great article on 4-5 minors openings: http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx   |pg||
pc|c8|nt|rhelle: this switch does not paralyse declarer|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: attempt to ruff 2 hearts  which as it happens wont be neccessary  and bank on spade finesse   4th spade discarded on club|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you ruff 2@h in dummy, you only need the @s finesse|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphznt: Drijver asked if they do it often bid 1NT with a 4crd Major|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: wow   other room  Grue in 3@CX|pg||
nt|petergill: he plans to ruff two hearts in dummy then try to pick spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or deWijs to hold @HH10?|pg||
nt|ady: would be betterof without 10@S   which gives the losing option|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX should make 6 or 7 or so tricks, one would think|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is also the option of another @h finesse now ... to get rid of the losing @s|pg||
nt|petergill: If de Wijs inserts @H10 on the next @h from dummy, it's tempting to finesse the jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller probably plays @HK @HQ randomly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but perhaps @HK would give Zagorin pause|pg||
nt|rhelle: by now West knows that East has the @h KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that Rob?|pg||
nt|rhelle: so inserting the @h 10 is a doable false card|pg||
nt|rhelle: very unlikely that declarer would finesse the H9 in trick 2, missing only 10 and Q|pg||
nt|petergill: Many lines were possible e.g. if declarer could tell that clubs are 6-2 not 7-1 (at this vul, 7 card clubs might bid 4@C not 3@C), then alt line of ruff club and finesse @S10, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: eventually making on crossruff which needs 1-4 @D, was possible.|pg||
nt|rhelle: if Bauke had the Ace, he'd cash it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime   the other room, which started 10 minutes after us, is already on board 22|pg||
nt|petergill: We learnt yesterday (Wooldridge's 6@S) that predicting the outcome of the play of slams like this one is difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller taking 1 of his famous pauses..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult ... especially of the future|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I heard he is looking for inspiration in those|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller no doubt hesitating between a trump and a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, he's wondering why declarer pitched a spade at Trick 1|pg||
nt|rhelle: a trump to stop 1 ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|rhelle: or a @c to force declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: This long think, if read correctly by an opponent, might clue a Grue-like declarer into thinking that E does not have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it looked like he is about to play a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: with @SQ, E might exit more quickly in @d or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Transnational Quarter Final  with 8 boards to score  Gordon over [heavy favorite] Angelini  by 31|pg||
nt|rhelle: assuming what Muller has based on his pauzes is a very dangerous business, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a @d exit is normal now, as if you have a singleton club. Or perhaps exit with @S3?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wooldridge on track to make 5@HX on  2  via double finesse in @C|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wstuart: Well, the 4-5 minor opening here has no choice - NS are playing a strong @C so the @D is nebulous.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S    but inlikely to lead club|pg||
nt|wstuart: When N rebids 2@C, he shows longer @C than @D.|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOLID SCORE FOR TEAM AMERICA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: All the pauses he has done when I've been commentating have been very revealing about the cards he has in his hand, if the oppoent is a Grue, a Hamman or a Meckstroth (i.e. someone ...|pg||
nt|petergill: who can read such things)|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting ... maybe the Dutch coaches should analyse that|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: 11 to USA   hand 2   5@HX   and made   conceeding 300  at this table|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|petergill: Declarer is wondering whether to play @S to dummy for @h hook, or play @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: has gone for former|pg||
nt|rhelle: that, incidentally, is the power of somebody like Helgemo|pg||
nt|rhelle: he always plays at the same pace - you never knows when he has a problem|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in senior bowl   USA2 has opened up 31 imp lead over France|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: the act of crossing to dummy makes @H hook likely - reasonable play on the bidding, simply unlucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why not play @H10,  the known card ??|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 8 ... Now West played low-high, techically and even number|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin saying somethin got de Wijs, and looking under the screen, all de wijs does is grin|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: ... it's amazing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin shaking his head|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: looking at Muller, maybe he is a poker player and tries to read EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter -- any comment about @H8 instead of @H10?|pg||
nt|petergill: I've sat EW and followed Bauke Muller around the room EW in pairs tournaments and can guarantee that he does NOT always play at the same slow pace - he takes his time only when he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: thinks he night have a problem. On many rounds, he was finished on time as EW. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: On this bidding, West had reason to believe the honours would be over his @SA and @CK and @DA - and right he was - but East had just enough for 4@s to be making|pg||
nt|petergill: @H8 could be from K108x. |pg||

nt|petergill: W from the attitude lead knows N has @SQxxx or @SQxxxx so he wants North to discard before S, as S has easy @s discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N has (cunningly?) kept his @H discard until last, to try to look more like a man with 5332 shape|pg||
nt|rhelle: the big strength of NS is their incredibly tight defence|pg||
nt|petergill: (I think) N knew he had to make 2 more discards, so he released the @D (less comfortable discard) before the @H, to make the position less clear to West. |pg||

nt|petergill: I was wrong - spade discard ---> @S can rise @HA on @H of dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: NS first discard   odd = encourage|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, but taking those discards at face value is a direct route to the poorhouse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S point was right, because then @S have broken 4-4, so S cannot throw a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: NS UDCA with 1st discard odd encourage|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H lead in OR    so no problem|pg||
nt|warrens:  we can see by this auction that W's distribution is concealed, making it harder for the defense (and putting us to sleep as we wait)|pg||
nt|petergill: so N's @D6 and @S's @S3 discard were really telling declarer as little as possible|pg||

nt|ahollan1: everyone either bid or implied @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: tough hand to play. If South has the @hK, North must have everything else - and then it's hard to make|pg||
nt|petergill: Correction - only Oz Open (q/f finished) and Parimatch (one board to go, 60+ imps ahead) have won the Transnat quarters - the other two matches have 4 or 5 boards to go|pg||

nt|petergill: Bauke Muller worked that bit out fast - now, with limited entries to his hand, he has to figure out what to do next ---> takes time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director is here for some time already, didn't say they are late, but they are, and it looks like he is looking who is slow|pg||

pc|dT|nt|rhelle: great switch!|pg||

nt|sybarra: good very early morning from Washington DC,  hello Bart |pg||
nt|bbramley: the play of the @S10 was unusual in that it might cost a trick if south started with Qx or Jx, but could gain if south started with Qxx or Jxx|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 27: If South was 4333 shape, then 3NT might have been better than 4@S, but reaching 3NT seems difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Actually, the 1@h opening on substandard values may help NS in staying low|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: more likely e/w could make game in hearts    but 4 losers with A@D wrong|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT = 4-card limit raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I think they have 40 minutes for 5 hands - in my opinion, South has been the slowest player at this table|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerability wrong for a 5@H save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Bathurst also saw vulnerability when he bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think the 1 @C alert is "could be 2" |pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: i'll have to get up to speed on the N/S system - not sure exactly what the bids mean - looks sort of like Polish so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he always is slow |pg||
nt|ady: but they have taken it|pg||
nt|ady: wrong again|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: hmm   i wonder how they differentiate 3@S & 2N   thought 1 might show 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: nothing going for USA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: The fact that we're seeing so many transfers (2@H showing spades) in the WC Grand Final is food for thought for those who don't like such methods|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: and that might e also Bart |pg||
nt|bbramley: i think 1@D=0-7, then natural|pg||
nt|bbramley: if so, i'm a little surprised south did not upgrade to a positive with his good suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 1@S was asking. 1@D was or 0-7 or something with both majors or a 3rd option i dont anymore|pg||
nt|rhelle: with 3@d, North shows values. South opts to defend, so North is happy with that|pg||
nt|ady: so the USA in game in both rooms  and more imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, this looks like -1 and 6 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|petergill: For the Transnational, the format in yesterday's Daily Bulletin (number 11) overrules any format on the website|pg||
nt|ady: 6 imps   so close to 6 imps behind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure with 4-fit in 1462|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately 4@H should fail last hand e/w   and 3NT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|rhelle: South should now play the @sK, in case declarer needs to find the @cQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: blame Jeff Rubens series of articles in Bridge World,  Useful Space Principal  for expanding use of tranfers beyond bids over 1N opener|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bbramley: OK - 1@S forced 1NT, then 2@H was a transfer|pg||
nt|bbramley: so he transferred to play the hand himself :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this might be a bit difficult to handle |pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Daily Bulletin 11 says 24 board R16 matches in Transnational. Bull 11 also has interesting article about the massive preparation by Indonesia Ladies for this event ref pages 28 and ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 15 I think, at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S could make    but in some danger    has done well to take the penalty|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|rhelle: Clever @sQ by North - he's hiding the Ace|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wstuart: It's possible for the Dutch to win 6 on the last board.  4@H -1 will be -50.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for all specs who are asking     3@S wouldn't occur to me either|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bbramley: he'd like about 5 entries to his own hand, but he's a little short of that|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Bd 25 here on BBO has been scored the same way it is scored (10 imp swing) on the WBF website and thus on the Bridgemate as scored by the players.  |pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: thought he might pitch |pg||
nt|bbramley: the clubs are good, which would let him throw a small card in each red suit, but that would have conceded down 1|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: and Oswald Jacoby for original transfer concept|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: even in context of Big Club system   too many losers, not enough winners  for me|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bbramley: so instead he's ruffed up, which will fail as well because west's trumps are too good|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 12-15|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous bid by S |pg||
nt|ady: east has nice hand  but will not be able to buy tje hand under the 7 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe 10 of @H as only entry |pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@s is a bit pessimistic though|pg||
nt|ady: maybe expecting further action  |pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, S led @D4 which worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room 1N was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: big difference which lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time   i would never choose @D lead over @C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director left after last board, directly slow again|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey once did a study of masses of hands which suggested that AJxx, K10xx , Q9xx and J8xx are the leads that turn out worst when faced with choice of 4 card suits to lead ...|pg||
nt|petergill: from to NT|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous is the word,  "weak in the knees"  timid etc |pg||
nt|rhelle: Unless Muller is playing a deep game|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts?|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is likely an inv+ xfr to @H/|pg||
nt|wstuart: Generally attributed to Jeff Rubens, often called Rubensohl (or transfer Lebensohl by some).|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: very light opening - in the modern style, or a very old-fashioned style, if you will - his hand qualifies easily by losing trick count, if not by honor count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you give up a trick after lead from Jxxx it usually doesn't come back   but  giving trick away after lead from K often does come back|pg||
nt|ady: cash out for down 1 on club lead|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bbramley: this is a poor setup for the N/S methods - north has been preempted into showing his second suit at a high level|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he wants to get doubled in 6 spades |pg||
nt|rhelle: no XX?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i didn't know KTxx was on the list|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst writing a lot, Zagorin just sitting not alerting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: semi alerts 2@C now|pg||
nt|ady: agressive move by north|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = penalty, shows max passed hand, acc to their System Card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14 bal or  1@S444|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: or 5 ?|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, a striped tale X|pg||
nt|sybarra: no XX,  "we" are happy |pg||
nt|ady: good value for australians|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: stripe tail ape...preventing 6 sp bid|pg||
nt|petergill: 1050 to 1430 = 9 imps|pg||
nt|ady: Brink has a pretty useless hand for spades  especially on ace king and another spade opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: South surely has a dead maximum for his 14-16 1NT opening.  Facing the inv+ xfr, he has a clear 4@H bid.|pg||
nt|ady: this will fil   so dutch will dow ok here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphznt: Grue: good luck, this time I mean it...|pg||
nt|ady: fail|pg||
nt|wstuart: It was a 1NT overcall, so he's not at a max.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Still, he has a fine hand with a fit, nice controls and a 5 card suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink has no idea if he is on time.. he asked they have 55 min for those last boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: of course, it's usually a poor setup to have a light opener into a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but sometimes pards clubs are more like his spade suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or spade suit is more like the club suit I should say |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - opening on distro is always optimistic, hoping for a fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you probably roll for 6 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he has 3 trumps to lose and the @H ace off the top, and there may be a handling charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps maybe the difficulty |pg||
nt|bbramley: although if he runs some diamonds, west may be tempted to compromise his trump holding (but i doubt he will)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12, 2 @S only went down 1 in other room,  for 3 imps |pg||
nt|bbramley: USA2 nibbling away...|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: and we have a looooooooooooonggg way to go |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C forced 2@D   and 2@S signoff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: maybe double after passing something in their methods|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: Hurd may have tht diamond defensive with west   and only 4@S from Muller    |pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North will reason that EW have a @c fit - and that West will have the @d. So he'll pay a @d to the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: gee they split 1/1 |pg||
nt|petergill: Then 2@C shows usually 4!+ clubs, u run into your lowest suit. Dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|ady: everyone in the action|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bbramley: from declarer's perspective, all he needs is 3-3 trumps and a winning guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2@C forced 2@D   2@S = 1-suit invite|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|sybarra: yes give W the East cards and probably home |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the spade cards)  |pg||
nt|bbramley: other room stopped in 2@S and made 140, so this should be 6 imps more for USA2|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: This is fairly normal - I too play it - that you dbl with a max passed hand, taking pressure off partner's need to make marginal pen dbls when u are passed hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for passed hand balancing DBL to be Woolsey   4-major and 5+minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1-suit @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially for pairs that play Mini-Landy in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl backfired as it (unluckily?) pushed EW out of their poor 1NT contract into a better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mini-Landy = Woolsey but with DBL=Penalty|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: hoping to bring in club suit   and lose 1 club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: thats is the end of that|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|rhelle: but what did East double on? Even at my level, this is suspect|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl ---> 1600 to 1430 = 5 imps the other way, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry   Multi-Landy  not Mini|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: Now that East knows @DA is offside from the opening lead, he can perhaps ruff out the short @DA and make 2@S for a big gain|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=game force relay|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: even so, nasty problem for West. It could be anything, from 4@s to 7@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is tightening nicely -(for us neutrals)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijver taking a postion  for a long thought|pg||
nt|roswolf: that weak2 by south is a hippy bid if ever i saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijer sighs a few times|pg||
nt|ady: will get to 6@S   iam sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: in a sense unlucky his pard is so weak|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like the 2@H preempt there.  He has good intermediates and virtually no def outside.|pg||
nt|ady: I  very much doubt pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: automatic opener for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oops   i don't know what they do after high interference :(|pg||
nt|ady: north fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: can we go back to 1N (about last board) to Muller|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S is reasonable, needs @HA onside or (if played by W) @HA lead - plus @S not 5-1 - and @d not 6-0!|pg||
nt|rhelle: Pass = Forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: denies a penalty X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Rob!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Nor th wil certainly lead the @cA|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 imps to Netherlands, surely|pg||
nt|ady: that  very ambitius  with void heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: look in movie,  it was club lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps 5@S would be voidwood (void spade, loking for 7@H), so West's choices were 4@S and 6@S - a guess. |pg||
nt|ady: as long as they dont bid 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS confirming that 1N is SemiForce|pg||
pc|d5|nt|warrens:  needs to lead @C Ace or a @S|pg||
nt|rhelle: However, North's second card will be problematic. If it's a @d, it's made|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone says @D,  my movie shows club |pg||
nt|petergill: As the card lie, normal(?) defence of @HQ to ace then @DK back defeats 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so expect East  5(332)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: 4@S after long tht or no long tht  west would surely pass|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: will S try 3 @H?|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: I would win the trump and put N to the test by playing @CK at Trick 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  now, N has to rise on a small @C lead from W, which I think is easy to do looking at dummy's @H's|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry bd 30 a diamond |pg||
nt|ady: mine shows a diamond|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead might beat ..... 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  an excellent spot    only down on heart lead and diamond return|pg||
nt|petergill: but is double dummy, @H lead is very normal|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: the E hand looks like the ones I have been holding recently |pg||
nt|bbramley: none vul is best for competing - i'm surprised he didn't, altho he already bid twice and his partner was there|pg||
nt|sybarra: enough!! |pg||
nt|ady: yes   club lead   cant get back and forth|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: yes - when i was a hippy at university abd did something silly like this against Boris Schapiro - he called it a hippy bid and said i would learn someday - never forgot that|pg||
nt|wstuart: Well everyone, I have to go play live bridge myself now.  Have fun and we'll see you tomorrow (or late tonight for those of us on the west coast of the US.)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rhelle: This is though|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: tricky   must play ace|pg||
nt|rhelle: very well played!|pg||
nt|ady: abd must resist diamond|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ady: north was awake|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK at Trick 2 could be a singleton king so might be taken, whereas the low club is more certain to draw the unwelcome ace (if @DK was onside)|pg||
nt|rhelle: South played the @c9, an even number|pg||
nt|warrens:  no way he'll play a @D.  W can't have been missing both minor aces|pg||
nt|rhelle: So my money is on another @c, to try and cut communications|pg||
nt|ady: race to 7 tricks    defence can take 4 diamonds and 3 hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: @DA asks attitude|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs, you really got 6? to Bathurst (but Zagorin didn't hear)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT would be crazy to be in - you can bid only your own 26 cards, not bid the 52 cards. |pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: but of they fail  declarer can take 4 clubs and 3 spades |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks like down a couple, but still a good save vs. the 140 that south could make in hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the OR made 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: W always on lead, to probably gives a trick somewhere |pg||
nt|bbramley: they may have gotten desperate trying to beat 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: to=so |pg||
nt|rhelle: both a @c and a @c are good - even a @h works as West can't get rid of 3 @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Bathurst bid 4@H with singleton Ace?|pg||
nt|petergill: S and W are on same side of screen - N and E on other side of screen|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|roswolf: this has just propelled e/w to slam - i trust south has flowers in his hair:)|pg||
nt|ady: declaration very soon|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|bbramley: vs. 4@H: possible make even against passive defense if declarer reads the position|pg||
pc|hA|nt|warrens:  I don't believe it.  what was he playing for?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is costly - and North has to be careful to not let it affect him|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play UDCA|pg||
nt|ady: played well    and then lapsed|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Simon upset...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bbramley: good club guess by wooldridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: whoa   i was just going to ask if they could untangle the @H tricks|pg||

nt|rhelle: yes, that is predictable|pg||

nt|roswolf: team orange wearing the sober suits|pg||
nt|petergill: with club void, I think S would play back lowest @d - not @DK - as sui pref|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs was afraid of Singleton A@H in south after this start..|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bbramley: well done - he made it - now that's a good save - so 7 imps and new leader|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure they would have bid a slam  slowly or quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs hand nice --- for cribbage, poker|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: another DBL that could [keyword] include Strong NT|pg||
mb|r|nt|rhelle: Yes, of course, sorry ... the 9 is an ODD number|pg||
nt|roswolf: you never know david - momentum of the auction is relevant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
nt|ady: good slam by the Netherlands OR|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid and well played by Sjoert Brink and Bas Drijver at the other table|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|rhelle: whereas South had an EVEN number of Clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's imagination is working overtime if he thought about bidding here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@C is something more than 5+@D but couldn't read what was written|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 4+@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: this should make |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: perhaps spades as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not|pg||
mb|3H|nt|warrens:  So, South meant the 9 to show a @H card and N took it as an odd number|pg||
nt|drewsky: It all depends on their defensive agreements...if the 9 of @C was count, then south erred. However, many experts us tend to play suit prefernce|pg||
nt|rhelle: fortunately, NS will sit out the next session|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think N played W for AKQJxxxxx void x Kxx, but that seems unlikely on the bidding - but he has to trust his partner's count card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if RDBL=@S  i would think Grue DBL=3@S|pg||
nt|ady: what is 3@H  game try   or barrage after east re-doubled?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: South has some extras not shown by 3NT - North might pass. |pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands extending the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS open very light, so Zagorin doesn't think he has enough to bid over 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: beats me     i think they're groping after somebody on wrong page with either RDBL or DBL|pg||
nt|ady: already too high with diamond ruff|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: 3@D  making    4@C  down 1    -50   ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 9 the expected 10 imps when the dutch made 3nt|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|bbramley: @C9 is a handy card here|pg||
nt|ady: diamond could never be right   unless his partner had the ace    which seems impossible|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surprised Grue didn't falsecard|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|bbramley: he'll get at least 4 spades and 1 of each, probably an extra club when west tries to cash them|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree, Peter, it had to be something like that, but that means playing W for a pretty crazy bid non-vul|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe so many spots out that still @D6 likely doubleton|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: maybe an imp for n/s  |pg||
nt|bbramley: he might be able to read the club position if @C5 is a count card|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no  not falsecard with 9  -- i was thinking 5 or 4   |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: maybe Bathurst should bid 3@S|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: about that slam: Playing UDCA, S should have played @C3 to show four cards in clubs - when he did not, N went wrong. |pg||

pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|h8|pg||
