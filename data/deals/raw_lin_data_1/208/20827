nt|garden2005: obymy nie ci¹gnêli na kontrakt 5@c asa @d bo wtedy wygraj¹ na przymusie @d@s|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@C wychodzi na doæ extremalnym manewrze Guillemarda:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: singiel atu przy dwóch pikach - to jest ta dodatkowa szansa|pg||
nt|meargent: 2@Ds was an inverted raise showing invitational or better vaues|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will probably set up his heart trick, which leads to a comfortable 10 winners.|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: hi Kit...welcome :)|pg||
nt|kit: hi|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ryskiel_: wywo³awcza na trefle - ma po 3 co najmniej w pozosta³ych kolorach to kontruje|pg||
nt|famus: now comes the whack if US acts further:)|pg||
nt|famus: push i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rare to see 1@C as 2+ but NOT transfer responses|pg||
nt|pawel90: na drugim stole Krzy - "tata" rozgrywa 5@c po kontrze na trefla - chyba dwukolorowej|pg||
nt|lechcold: da radê|pg||
nt|garden2005: ale wtedy i tak to jest najlepsza rozgrywka (na manewr G), rozgrywaj¹cy nie ma wyboru|pg||
nt|westjava: sure, they do it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: note N orths pass- I am sure that most will venture 3H but this is not Israeli style|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best lead|pg||

pc|dT|nt|famus: next|pg||
nt|josj: well, 3nt is definitely easier, with the @D behaving...|pg||

nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|meargent: 2@Hs is conventional|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 2@d was written on paper: limit raise, 4+|pg||
nt|meargent: 3@Ds shows limit raise|pg||
nt|timb: I',m not a fan of that 1NT opening; it fails to meet the "balanced" requirement of most people's idea of a 1NT opening|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: head on the table....thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i do not think she has higher ambitions than 5d|pg||
nt|odysseus69: is it possible that South has jxx - North does not want to provide entry to dummy so withhods Q righly|pg||
nt|odysseus69: small diamond to 9 is the deep finesse play|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
pc|hA|nt|famus: Barel has no idea--everything works for him--wud b pleasently surprised|pg||
nt|famus: looking at 4 possible losers|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in the open room we have Newell and Reid for NZ vs Grue and Llall for USA|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and they landed in the best spot|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: East after @h3; ok..|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: it looks like it's old (NS) vs Young (EW) at this table :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Hello Al|pg||

nt|sharkey: Will make - but Indonesia may pick up a couple of IMPs in @H contract|pg||
nt|orentol: yea.. and might know they may miss major fit.|pg||
nt|dburn:  South may find the club ruff hard to believe, of course|pg||
nt|dburn:  and North ought to play the queen of hearts now, not the ace|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi David|pg||

nt|mamos: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for all the results live scores and so on|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this shouldn't take long|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so back to describing the events|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not clear to North how best to continue|pg||

nt|odysseus69:  eventually he will ruff|pg||
nt|odysseus69: discarding is giving up|pg||
nt|eamongall: I would think that 2@S is rebid is on the low side given its precision but then 1@S only promises 3 card @Ss .. I better look for some convention cards |pg||

nt|ahollan1: i also have links for convention cards if people are interested|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Hi David|pg||
nt|timb: Perhaps EW are followers of Sally Brock's "Easy Guide to Five-Card Majors"; there she advocates opening 1NT on 4441s when in the 15-17 point range. |pg||
nt|timb: Count me out|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Just 1@c and 1@h|pg||

nt|sharkey: Nice switch from N|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|starkist: natural way to guess the @d's at least|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: S has it difficult|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: EW big club  and many bids value "zz" points  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]  lots of relays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  fairly vanilla 2/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: imps are converted to VPs [victory points]|pg||
nt|dburn:  since if she leads ace and another, South may try for a heart ruff and not a club ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: so England are in the game with a chance - but the problem is declarer cant get to dummy to take the finesse in @S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: and top 8 teams advance to Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|westjava: freak distribution, interesting play here|pg||
nt|blewah: @d or @h from hand is reasonable|pg||
nt|westjava: other room, Gaviard (S) not to overcall after 1@S|pg||
nt|copeyj: so i think it is down 1 regardless|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed - no real way to do that|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the defenders slightly fortunate that declarer's spades aren't solid|pg||
nt|dburn:  Rimstedt quite right to overtake the queen of hearts - North should have @hAQ doubleton to defend like that|pg||
nt|timb: It was good play to take @HA; otherwise declarer could have scrambled home|pg||
nt|timb: Interestingly at double dummy, the contract was lost at trick one; declarer had to play the @S10 or @SJ at trick one|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|meargent: 6@Ds being played by italians in OR|pg||
mc|10|nt|jbgood: looks as if the @d suit comes in in 4@h, so a normal contract turns into a good save|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: USA not X'd in the other room|pg||

nt|mamos: another overtrick imp to England |pg||
nt|chmitty: 8 qualifiées pour les 1/4 de finale|pg||
nt|ritong: le titre dit 18/21?|pg||
nt|barbyh: open room NZ got to 5 d's dbld for a 12 imp pickup|pg||
nt|blewah: difficult hand. could be made though I think of @c was low from the table|pg||
nt|sharkey: At IMPs she wanted to make sure of the contract - thus she played @HA|pg||
nt|copeyj: so down 1 here, and maybe a couple of imps to England|pg||
nt|timb: If 4@H is played by West then North cannot afford to lead a spade.|pg||
nt|april7: loks like a 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|panosk: cud have been saved|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1st seat favorable   2@S or 3@S?|pg||

mb|2N|nt|josj: yes, they did better on a pairs'event basis ;)|pg||
nt|meargent: we arent proud a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|chmitty: le dernier de la journée|pg||
nt|kit: 2@D shows 4 spades, 5 diamonds, 5-11.  Guess he had a heart in his diamonds :)|pg||
nt|kit: actually, he can be 4-4|pg||
nt|kit: This gives Martel a problem.  Normally he would be looking to play in spades, but he knows that isn't a good idea.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Operator, do you read me?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: we have zero specs in this room because you are invisible|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: yes, i loggin in as visible|pg||
nt|josj: 6@H is extremely cold here but will W bid on?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 4h has to be a strong bid at these colors|pg||
nt|garden2005: Kibice*|pg||
nt|joanem: bidding 3s there seemed wrong on the shape - with only 5 trumps   |pg||
nt|mamos: no one has much here either|pg||
nt|ritong: okidoki|pg||
nt|chmitty: après il reste l'Inde, l'Indonésie et Trinidad & Tobago pour les Françaises|pg||
nt|copeyj: I believe 1@D is precision, so not promising length in the suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: Right, David?|pg||
nt|april7: aftera 2@S opening by W,or a multi, N will bid 2 NT and S will raise|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: no you did not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: you are invisible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: you did not uncheck Invisible|pg||

nt|odysseus69: transfer responses everywhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: so pls shut down and do it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet many balance with 3N|pg||
nt|joanem: better defending hand with AK AJ |pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed, and 1NT would be a mini|pg||
mb|3D|nt|josj: NS also have a good save in 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: the 6d bid probably give you confidence to underleaed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2S now usually balanced with 4S - Wow that was surprise|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think he was taking advance sacrifice but North may expect a lot more- but the colours may be a clue|pg||
nt|odysseus69: didfficult for North to pass|pg||
nt|odysseus69: who bid 4S - sorry I have misread - please confrm auction |pg||
nt|eamongall: 14-16 NT |pg||
nt|copeyj: Not sure what 1@S is, however|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: uff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ ladies off to a great start v China, Seniors the opposite v Indonesia :(|pg||
nt|odysseus69: intersting alert of Souths pass|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@S is balanced with at least one major, Erik Fryklund tells me|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@H call showed spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This is plain silly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not in this match  -- identical auctions both tables|pg||
nt|joanem: no support X i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Meyers alerted|pg||
nt|joanem: denies 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL gets the nod because 4@H and only doubleton @S   @SAxx and 4@H  would probably bid 3N since able to duck @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both lead @SQ  but would be interesting to examine play after @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting if done by someone else:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller could bid 2@C to show loing @D -- but needed [at least] another King |pg||
nt|odysseus69: all the world seems to love 1NT on South - as usual I am in a minority|pg||
nt|reisig: I'm w you|pg||
nt|ritong: quoi qu il en soit, comme disait le regretté pierre schemeil, la meilleure façon d aborder un dernier tour c est d avoir un match d avance|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Bas Drijver won @HA and played back @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably denied 3 hearts - no support double|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: re-hi all, we had technical problems here...|pg||
nt|lechcold: przy pomocy opisanej wpustki Indonezyjka wygra³a 3BAX:(|pg||
nt|odysseus69: friendly spades so only 1 down|pg||
nt|eamongall: whats going on here .. |pg||
nt|eamongall: ah quantitive 4NT .. 14-16 ...facing 16 |pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein has a good hand, but with quick tricks and balanced there isn't much incentive to compete to 3@S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphznz: then i miss one board|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: probably a good board for france|pg||
nt|josj: over 5@D, W could no longer make the 5@C fitbid to solve East's problems...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably win here to prevent @C shift  or early @H guess but duck seems to have merit too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I assumed 4S from South|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sorry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the 4S bid was so ncharacteristic that I almost fell off my chair|pg||
nt|kit: The Stayman call works well when West has 4 hearts, but if not they will be overboard.  And even when West has 4 hearts, 4@H might not be a bargain.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: now we are 2|pg||
nt|kit: The spade lead, while normal, is quite helpful to declarer as spades is his source of tricks.|pg||
nt|kit: Madala's best chance is to duck -- but his partner might have a singleton spade and a top heart honor in which case it is necessary to play the jack.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|meargent: @HQ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: tough hand to lead from for Smith|pg||
nt|copeyj: but this is a very ambitious game, which should go down with 3@S and 1@D to lose, but stranger things have happened|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: So what??|pg||
nt|jbgood: hm - too long an address|pg||
nt|pawel90: na drugim stole Martens gra z reki E 3BA po wicie w karo - trafi³ ju¿ pika|pg||
nt|meargent: close|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: à 3SA on ne peut pas à la fois affranchir les @c et encaisser les @d, faute de communication|pg||
nt|dburn:  good lead, but West has to put in the nine to make sure of an entry - that is, unless declarer puts in the jack to kill it|pg||
nt|april7: S was looking for a 4-4 fit in @S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|timb: I prefer 2@S instead if 1NT by South; Australia's top masterpoint winner Bob Richman believes that "more points are lost by not supporting partner on 3-cards that any other action:|pg||
nt|kit: 3@D will make with the favorable club position -- but that same club position defeats 3@S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: would love to finesse in @D [trusting @DJ to be honest]  but transportation is bad without peeking for location of @HA|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4NT will make probably 11 tricks so lets put on the kettle |pg||
nt|sharkey: As predicted Indonesia ended up in the superior @H contract and picked up 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|timb: He has convinced me |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can insert scores manually afterwards|pg||

nt|april7: now its easy to finnes the @S|pg||
nt|panosk: Hi Aramesh thx|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: the hand is much easier seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is the downside of using double dummy software like GIB or Deep Finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those tools cheat by looking at all the hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: even without those tools, it's more easy with all hands open|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South might have bid 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|chmitty: mais Joanna va devoir défausser aussi|pg||
nt|blewah: had E dbled 2@c stayman, maybe interesting|pg||

nt|chmitty: à 3SA ou à 4@s ?|pg||
nt|ritong: j ai naivement imaginé que levin dirait 3SA|pg||
nt|eamongall: some red suit work required to bring home 4@S here if they bid it |pg||
nt|kit: Good 6@C contract here (particularly with South declarer), but shattered by the 4-0 club split.|pg||
nt|kit: So if either team bids badly and stops in game they will win 12 or 13 IMPs.  Bridge can be an unfair game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i believe the other dutch pairs play Raptor NT overcalls  so North will bid 1N to show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubt it will make any difference in final contract/result|pg||
nt|reisig: Not the toughest hand to play |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H or pass?|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S block I think|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, must be weak|pg||
nt|panosk: 1NT not forcing?|pg||
nt|panosk: confirmed and handy in this hand :)|pg||
nt|panosk: to open 1@H with W hand like in open room i think is very streched, much prefer pass too|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joanem:  better to show your 4 card suit and play the 5/2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: coffee hand ?|pg||

nt|joanem: oops she has not |pg||
nt|mamos: hi|pg||
nt|petergill: The play might be interesting if they reach 3NT|pg||

nt|starkist: did sharyn really get out the jack of @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: previous board, @h 6|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: was the lead|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes, standard and weak NT|pg||
nt|april7: interesting hand for a @S contract, depending how high they will go!without a @C lead might work for 12tricks, but not easy to find the 4th J of trumps!!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lechcold: w 18 sorry:(|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: my bet is on Willard... she will make this|pg||
nt|josj: I tend to agree...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the minor suit 10s and the weak hearts suggest a pass of 1NT|pg||
nt|joanem: now they will have a bad time in the 43 breaking 42 |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this can be a swing board|pg||
nt|meargent: and it aint 4th best|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N is not sure|pg||
nt|meargent: well i am|pg||
nt|ritong: peut être ont elles une réponse pour les deux majeures|pg||
nt|eamongall: but stockdale is in there advertising her wares ...understandably |pg||
nt|eamongall: so declarer should be ok .. |pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see 3 NT makes - opportunity for the Americans next door|pg||
nt|sharkey: Vul games shud be bid if the chance of success is 37% according to the math gurus - this hand may fit in|pg||
nt|panosk: 4 inscepable losers in N hand shud be a push|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW will try 4@S which looks OK with @S onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Lall's fit showing jump shut out the @S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here GeO remains silent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also 3N east  after 1@S open with Fredin passing 1st round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HT falling means 2nd stopper in the suit -- and natural attack of @C kills entry to long @H|pg||
nt|joanem: 2s much easier |pg||
nt|joanem: and jill lead |pg||
nt|odysseus69: but 2S also down|pg||
nt|ritong: et dans ce cas levin aurait opté pour 4@s, sûre d un doubleton en face|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D denies 3 hearts (else Support Dbl), hence alert (I think)|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Barbara and everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th leads   upside-down count & attitude|pg||
mb|6C|nt|joanem: the long suit with long trumps - same principle as last hand |pg||

nt|vugraphznz: yes 2@D denied a 3 card @H|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Vincent|pg||
nt|odysseus69: assume he has shown heart shortage so West has nothing wasted although only 12 points|pg||
nt|april7: should W has opened 2 NT for the minors, its too weak though, if they even play that convention, then its easier|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: only need to find the killing defense|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am told it is not difficult - but i would also say it is not difficult to bid something with GeO's hand - and he didnt:)|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi Barbara-wlc:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not so good if West had 642 of spades and J1065 of hearts- the toy worked but I am not convinced|pg||
nt|timb: I'll be away from the table for a short while; something has come up|pg||
nt|kit: However, Levin better not duck his ace of diamonds.  If he does, the trick won't come back as he will be squeezed.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: nice shift|pg||
nt|alunand14: we watching the match between England (rank 1) with Indonesia (rank 4)....|pg||
nt|mamos: this might all depend on Spades|pg||
nt|copeyj: Rimstedt smelt this one out - and this is going to be uncomfortable for brock|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: just saw this one go down    Pakistan North got diamond lead   and played spade to the king and trick 2  and conceeded 2nd spade tricke and spade ruff and K@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: she will find a nice surprise soon|pg||
nt|kit: He actually will have a problem.  If South has KQ of diamonds, going up ace sets up 2 diamond tricks while ducking only 1 diamond trick.|pg||
mc|11|nt|ritong: de nos jours, on dit 1SA 3SA dans les deux salles et on laisse les défenseurs se débrouiller|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is easy , but 3NT on a @h lead looks hard-to-analyse - should make 3NT maybe?|pg||
nt|kit: But he now knows South has AJ of spades, and likely king of hearts, so he won't duck.|pg||

nt|panosk: not my best 2@C but cant see anything beter available in natural systems|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and was very disapointed lol|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphznz: almost live now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this will be difficult|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not so cheap 1100 - but still a save|pg||
nt|joanem: minorwood?|pg||
nt|ritong: tiens, joanna a trouvé une quatrième possibilité|pg||
nt|starkist: wont go down in 3n now like other table|pg||
nt|sharkey: West wont sit for this I think|pg||
nt|april7: good bid by E, and now S has a problem how high  SHE should go!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphznz: i can see 3 hearts and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=6@D, short @C, NF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make that 6+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs could show same shape with stronger hand by bidding above 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady opened East hand 1@D so that will wake up his Sadek|pg||
nt|reisig: No comment|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: levin did not alert on the other side|pg||
nt|barbyh: I cant imagine south passing|pg||
nt|starkist: 500 if passes|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 3nt will definitely not the final contract at this table|pg||
nt|edou2704:  3h is one down|pg||
nt|edou2704:  3@h|pg||
nt|chmitty: salut Edouard|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: yes was 1 down, will correct...|pg||

nt|ritong: le chelem est loin d être ridicule|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: board 20 corrected, sorry|pg||

nt|edou2704:  France played game in other room wirh 9 facing 11 , but failing|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: south thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and passes|pg||
nt|chmitty: as you cas see EW easily make 4 or even 5@c|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why wud N x?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Transfer responses to 1@C in competition, I imagine 1C(1D)X would be any 4+ @H hand, here 1@H is 4+ @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 2@S showing a minimumwith 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Madala didn't have an easy decision since his partner could have been broke -- but he got it right.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and still this is really a no-play game  |pg||
nt|blewah: 7 tricks visible. Decl will find more from @c|pg||

nt|starkist: 5d cold tho|pg||
nt|starkist: as is 4s|pg||

nt|odysseus69: the response of 4H not alerted - can you explain Joan|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has something gone wrong?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin looks puzzled by the 4d bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 5d bid sorry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks as if North showed 1 key card by mistake|pg||
nt|joanem: cue of hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if 4C was key card North may reaiise she gave wrong response and bid 6C now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin stil thinking|pg||
nt|joanem: levin very worried about spades as no cue there?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no sac |pg||
nt|chmitty: Espérons que Levin entame @c pour nous laisser une chance|pg||
nt|chmitty: mais je n'y crois pas|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 4 in 3NT - S can keep K10x, KJ, void, Ax, so perhaps randomly trying to guess @C10 early is the best way to go |pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: thanks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it also allows NS to get into the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here  Muller doesn't have any help from NS  so has to guess @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: Palmer may play ace of hts and a ht,   to hold down ruffs?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garden2005: ta uwaga o b³êdzie w ustawieniu pochodzi³a od rosenknoppa :) brawo za czujnosc|pg||
nt|joanem: yep eek |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin passed and said I do not know..|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: both sides of the screen discussing the 4c bid lol|pg||
nt|starkist: 6 on a guess|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D seems to have worked - North didnt have enough for 2H but maybe after 3C -p-p 3H is possible|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@h was possible as dealer|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|petergill: Welcome to Wayne Stuart|pg||
nt|barbyh: a nice surprise when the heart king is onside|pg||
nt|meargent: 6@Ds is quite a good contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm asked what écarry over" means : it means that at the start of this match, there is already a small dscore, coming from the results between both teams|pg||
nt|chmitty: when they met in the eliminatories|pg||
nt|chmitty: "carry over" sry|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud N have raised after pd willing to play 1 NT xx?|pg||
nt|april7: S shoukld stay small, I doubt if W will continue with ace of @C|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like 6 @s |pg||
pc|h5|nt|drorp: not easy decision for Amaral, and he gives a lot of credit to the vul overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: hate 5@c there - seems better to bid 4@c the previous round  Job done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer will probably try to find @S10 doubleton somewhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real way to force defense to break @S or @D   [frozen suits]|pg||
nt|meargent: not such a good line if @Ss ly badly|pg||
nt|meargent: should play @S NOW|pg||
nt|sybarra: but it ace of sp with W,  now would have to deal with @D ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: and a club loser   |pg||
nt|sybarra: that was but if, spade ace|pg||
nt|meargent: she is probably DOOMED then in any case|pg||
nt|meargent: if east has 3@Hs |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N asking about signals|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: shaking her head now|pg||
nt|meargent: in OR north bid a direct 4@Hs over 3@Ss and US got to 8@Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and S is reading the bulletin|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess the ace of sp has to be with E, given the opening |pg||
nt|meargent: ace and @H will work but i dont thinck its best|pg||
nt|chmitty: on peut gagner à cartes ouvertes je crois|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  upside-down count & attitude  Smith vs NT  [but won't apply here]|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lechcold: tu te¿ jest szansa na punkty... w kiery na WE mo¿na sporo ugraæ|pg||
nt|ritong: c est en tout cas ce que dit GiB|pg||
nt|starkist: virtually cold on non@h lead|pg||
nt|meargent: but 5@Ds is better than 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: netherlands open went 1 down in 6@d|pg||
pc|hT|nt|josj: best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live results under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|joanem: i think jill L thought that 5d was cue agreeing clubs denying 1st or 2nd round control of spades - so passed 5d|pg||
nt|lechcold: Murniatinie zaryzykowa³a wejcia 1@D,ciekawe...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a ile Lechu?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|drorp: double dummy this contract makes, double finessing the JT of hearts, and chagas might actually make it if he can place Gino with the A@C from the quick double on 5@C|pg||
nt|grebrof: Israel is unbeaten so far - 16, 25 and 15, while Brasil have scored 18, 14 and 20 |pg||
nt|drorp: sorry 1 off double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: south passed twice|pg||
nt|meargent: but then again i am a lousy declarer|pg||
nt|starkist: 1n opening with east hand other table , you approve pepe?|pg||
nt|meargent: not really|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fokal: probably counting on 3 @h tricks with the finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: na drugim stole 2N i wist kierowy. Jest szansa na pierwsze punkty|pg||
nt|april7: but still not 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|april7: because of trumps 3-1|pg||
nt|panosk: needs to be carefull but i they she will make |pg||
pc|s8|nt|josj: the @C shift|pg||
nt|blewah: 9 now|pg||
nt|westjava: you see, how lady find a lady...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphznz: welcome back all |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: play was very slow until now, so we did not miss many boards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it is a recurring event- players give wrong response to keycard - dont know why |pg||
nt|lechcold: to zale¿y od wistu i rozgrywki:) po walecie karo na przyk³ad to hoho...|pg||
nt|blewah: it's women's business|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: good|pg||
nt|xenya: so 11 tricks coming|pg||
nt|drorp: 5@C is a big gamble that they make 4@S when u have 2 sure defensive tricks, unless he actually thought he can make 5@C|pg||
nt|starkist: @d's too meaty and prime|pg||
nt|meargent: too good for weak nt |pg||
nt|starkist: that too|pg||
nt|panosk: * i think she will make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: that also lets you see result from ALL tables of any given hand|pg||
nt|ritong: ça joue toujours|pg||
pc|sT|nt|westjava: I always wrong|pg||
nt|copeyj: This is a pretty good game - wonder if Dhondy-Senior have some methods to get to it next door|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: so good ducking and good covering from East|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: now she will be home|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: for another tie hand|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein might have tried 4@S, though risky.  On the actual hand, 4@S will probably make.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: 4H virtually laydown but somehow both rooms cant get there- difficult- both North and South dislike their diamond holding but  it is a perfect marriage|pg||
nt|eamongall: I see about 5 more tricks for NS|pg||
nt|eamongall: thats 7 in total and 3 down ... and 200  from their team mates |pg||
nt|sharkey: Is this the first time the Indonesian Ladies Team have advanced this far in Benice Cup Hendra?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: safe to take @C finesse|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mamos: it seems a bit umnlikely to make after Pass by dealer|pg||
nt|fokal: she will still make 3 @h tricks, but not for that reason :)|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|westjava: how about lady of diamond, let's see|pg||
nt|starkist: I only like my steak meaty and prime|pg||
nt|meargent: good enough for strong nt but it does seem to me a bit of a shot|pg||
nt|edou2704:  the result from round robin is partially keeped|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: another gain for NZ - should be 6 imps|pg||
nt|meargent: and beth palmer is a world champion|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are not exactly a slouch Mr.. Silver |pg||
nt|meargent: not as a declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well just arrange the auction so that pard plays all the tough hands |pg||
nt|meargent: thats always my hope|pg||
nt|sharkey: *Venice|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chmitty: il aurait fallu jouer @h et @h en défaussant son @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: mais c'est jouer spécifiquement les atouts 41 et les @h 22|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna joue simplement pour l as de @s placé et les atouts ronds|pg||
nt|ritong: maintenant, si levin ne prend pas, elle aura des éléments de table|pg||
nt|chmitty: Levin va prendre et jouer @d c'est certain|pg||
nt|ritong: et de toute façon, si levin ducke, c est fini|pg||
nt|ritong: et elle le sait|pg||
pc|d3|nt|alunand14: yes....before only rank 9 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: impressive feat|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lindop led @S so that gave declarer  10|pg||
nt|lokaty: na pewno dziwi brak wejcia 1@D po treflu, pewnie maj¹ jak¹ konwencjê|pg||
nt|edou2704:  if winning team from this match finished before the other, they have a 50% carry over|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphznz: back in the tank now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: she closed the screen asking about the count|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right Rich- I failed to spot the pass|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: 66 teams all playing same board  makes for great comparisons|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if south doesn't have the @sJ he might now underlead the Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CJ to show more points and maybe get Muller to place @SA in north??|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: in fear of giving 2 discards on @c if declarer had @c KQT|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d a indiqué un fit franc, trois cartes a @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: on ne peut plus que défausser pour ne chuter que d'une|pg||
nt|chmitty: double mauvais coup Français : le par était à 6@d contrés deux de chute|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna a du mal a se résoudre à chuter|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: of course N threw a small @S on the first trick, sorry|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: unless declarer gors fot ultra safety -- which he did|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@H is a sensible spot to be - you don't want to be in 6@H on a finesse when 650/680 might pick up imps if 500 or 300 happens at other table|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: mais..|pg||
nt|edou2704:  if they lost, there is a 33% carry over|pg||
nt|panosk: even with heart lead you take @HA cash A@C play spade to hane throw @H on K@C and try to establis @D|pg||
mc|10|nt|grebrof: the 4th match (the internetsite is finally up again), Israel scored 22 and Brasil 25, so both these teams have started off very well|pg||
nt|drorp: heading towards 2 off now, had to play a heart, now he won't have 2 entries anymore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cullin just convincing himself that nothing can go wrong with @D play|pg||

nt|panosk: conservative approaches, by both S and W|pg||
nt|panosk: tough luck for France|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit would preempt here   what about Chip Martel?|pg||
nt|kit: And they did stop in 3NT on the previous board at the other table, so 12 undeserved IMPs to USA1|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they are playing very very...very fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: tu nasi graj¹ 5@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@H sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil held too many @S to duck the Q    i think|pg||
nt|mamos: so a quietish start to the match with a few overtricks and a small partscore swing|pg||
nt|ritong: enfin, pas tout de suite|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lot of biddable suits here|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never should have doubted|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@S + @C/@D|pg||
nt|starkist: that would cheer up e/w if they were to guess 3n had happened other room|pg||
nt|eamongall: but 700 in total  is 12 imps to England |pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play 4@S as STRONG hand  [don't preempt over preempt]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 4 pik? a mo¿e co innego od Piotra?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Leaping Michaels   4@D=@D and @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H from North now standard |pg||
nt|sybarra: and an easy 3 nt here ++2|pg||
nt|meargent: the trick here is to avoid slam|pg||
nt|westjava: 10 or 11 tricks, aria?|pg||
nt|westjava: or to Felipe?|pg||
nt|blewah: i think it was 11|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will north join in?|pg||
nt|panosk: for us neutrals a tighter match means more excitement|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like 2@D = michaels = both majors|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I'm quite surprised about this call|pg||
nt|kit: If Bocchi is thinking, he may be surprised about Madala's hand also|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: IF you agree to play the convention with your partner -- make sure you know if 4minor bid is forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller has a good hand now with 2 aces, 4 trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: though he would prefer to have more high card points in the red suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in the other room  elAhmady running trump interesting squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and LOTS of pressure on defenders to discard properly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump to 6@D very reasonable here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know if there is any scientific way to investigate staying lower or getting higher|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: but with the hearts the way they are, even 5@d is a difficult contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4333 in N, not source of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think I remember n/s can open some wild nt bids |pg||
nt|panosk: 4th seat oppenings are guided by the rule of 15 , ot for some rule of 14, that is if the total of cards spades and points is 15 you open |pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|meargent: hopefully for NS they wont find their @D fit|pg||
nt|chmitty: c'était très dur de passer 5@h pour Joanna : en disant 5@h Sud indique seulement son envie de jouer au palier de 5|pg||
nt|ritong: l alerte de 2@h passe signifie que passe dénie 3 @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: ok, ty Felipe|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Felipe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: majors I suspect|pg||
nt|panosk: i prefer 15 some prefer 14 depends on your style|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@D = Spade fit + Diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i saw notes for one pair that use  4@H/@S to differentiate hand types  for this exact problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: partscore board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but if 4C was keycard then ideal- provided North knows about it|pg||
nt|garden2005: spójrzcie na flagi, Indonezyjki wygl¹daj¹ jak lewe Polki :) nadstawi¹ siê zaraz|pg||
nt|petergill: Back on Bd 4 in 3NT - in the 6 card ending, S has to pitch something - @HJ looks like the only chance, now declarer exits in @C and the defence is awkwardly placed. Sp perhaps no ...|pg||
nt|petergill: need to guess @C10 in 3NT on Bd 4|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT weak |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|eamongall: this is precision 1@S so limited |pg||
nt|timb: NS have put up a good barrage|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 5 @s pewnie powie|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to mo¿e wgoniæ w szlemika i wtedy trzeba broniæ|pg||
nt|drorp: other table bidding started with north opening and then rebidding clubs, so this result might be duplicated, but i didn't see how the bidding ended|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S=slam interest @H  and 5@C=slam interest @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double pprobably was 4 or more spades where 1S would deny 4|pg||
nt|lechcold: eee co Ty, bilety powrotne i tak maj¹ pewnie zarezerwowane na 30-go|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT  F1|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes, this team has prepared a year ago in preparation for Sea Games on Nopember...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like NS will not find their 9 card @S fit....|pg||
nt|copeyj: Sweden are in 3@D on b21 I am told|pg||
nt|copeyj: so that will be a few imps back to them|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@S i prefer from S here asking for stopper with strong hand |pg||
nt|kit: Levin doubles for the club lead.  He would not be happy if South redoubled for business and they play it there.|pg||
mb|2D|an|lerted|nt|kiwibridge: 14-17 and aggressive jump by Ware|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-4 zz  could have game force strength    [zz  A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=a) 16-19 HCP, 5+@H  b) any 20+ HCP|pg||
nt|panosk: the French ladies need to compose themshelves fast so as to avoid paying this hand more than they already did|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 50-ka albo 100-ka w zale¿nosci od prze³yku|pg||

nt|chmitty: encore 5imps qui vont partir|pg||
nt|ritong: car, avec trois @ss on contrerait " de soutien"|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S longer spades than hearts - else Mike Ware bids 2@D|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: S thinking about 7@D...|pg||
nt|timb: This auction makes it harder for South to bid 7@D; it sounds like a guess|pg||
nt|april7: after this bidding only a partscore in @C is best|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ryskiel_: sorry na 5 to albo polska 100-ka albo rosyjskie SPGie|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Jacek cos mowi pod nosem, ze chyba mogl spasowac|pg||
nt|grebrof: as I see there are others that are more updated than me - the 5th match has suddenly appeared on the site :D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my notes stop here :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: South asked about 3@S, West: let me think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe EW play the same 1@C structure as Bertheau-Nystrom  but  i don't have those 4th bids either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from one who KNOWS     3@S=it shows 3-4 zz, 5+H, 4S, void in C|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: is what west explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reliable source confirms my guess about 4@S/5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice stop!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump lead makes sense but probably @SK|pg||
nt|westjava: fast bid to 4@S|pg||
nt|chmitty: another chance for a small swing to France|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs asking about 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if it's exactly 5@s an 4+ in a minor. South confirming this|pg||
nt|barbyh: prob shows a nf distributional hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|meargent: from my point of view this is more than decent if NS bid it|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 sp squeaks home|pg||
nt|panosk: they wud have ended in 5@C also since no stopper|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess 4@D showed a strong 4M bid (or something more specific)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphznz: 4h did not make at the other table....so another big chunk of imps for france|pg||
nt|josj: they were in 2nt...:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: loool... i see now|pg||
nt|lokaty: treflowy tylko k³ad³ chyba|pg||
nt|lokaty: 3@S da³ Burek, bo graj¹ 1 NT 14-16|pg||
nt|joanem: but having an 8 card beautiful diamond suit is sad to be raising clubs on 3 small  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this link seems to work: http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-venice-cup|pg||
nt|mamos: not much to be said about this either|pg||
nt|petergill: Geo Tislevoll moved from Norway to Auckland New Zealand when he married Faith Mayer who lives in NZ but she sometimes play s bridge for her country of origin Philippines|pg||
nt|chmitty: not so easy to grab 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C=relay   4@S=3zz  4630|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many still play that 1S promises 5 and double is no more than 4 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly this pair is not afraid to bid 'em |pg||
nt|meargent: EW will have to try really hard to let this one through and i for one dont think they can do it|pg||
nt|chmitty: Bénédicte a chuté 4@c|pg||
nt|chmitty: sans doute sur le flanc AR de @h suivi de petit @s ... elle a mal deviné|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont like 3S bid|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like a gazilli auction to me...2@c=enq and 2@d is 8+  says Gad viren169 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so they're already doing better than the Canadian EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H played by West    so there is risk of @S ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ZZ   simply  A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with trump lead can still make 12 tricks by guessing south singleton trump and ruffing finesses in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that reasonable play when contract is 5@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady still playing   21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rare situation having Muller table faster than other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D was pushed  so only imps from 1st board of the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and potential swing here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened south hand 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: many pairs playing 4@h on this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a number of pairs play "leaping Michaels" over 3-level preempts too|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: probably not being able to show a 2-suiter over a 3@s-opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: including Sadek who alerted his 4@D overcall :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady bid 4@S and Brink 5@C!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Sweden bid the slam so 13 imps in the bag|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to wróc¹ p[iechot¹ wczeniej...i by³oby to jak najbardziej s³uszne|pg||
nt|chmitty: double dummy you do of course, but Bénédicte is not (yet) a magician|pg||
nt|chmitty: for instance is South plays another @s you must play @h to the 9, than the K from your hand ..etc..|pg||
nt|april7: good decision by S, although she has a @H stop, its a female feeling that @C don't break|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: szlemik treflowy, doæ kiepski|pg||
nt|westjava: decl will go home with this lead|pg||
nt|meargent: i like this result from OR better than the last one|pg||
nt|timb: I would pass 6@S - I hate bidding the same hand twice and 7@D gives the opponents a sure plus|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, he does want a club lead.  So it is a matter of risk vs. reward judgment.|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Madala saying loud : My pass show stopper in clubs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphznz: a lot of tricks now|pg||
nt|eamongall: I got a txt message the other day from a pard and he says PD sees lots of gazilli in Bermuda Bowl ... that means more updates in my bidding sys  is coming |pg||
nt|viren169: Hi all...|pg||
nt|eamongall: good good |pg||
nt|viren169: This does look like a simple Gazilli auction... and yes a lot of partnerships are playing it now...|pg||
nt|panosk: @d return will puzzle decl but i think will find |pg||
nt|kit: As it turns out, Weinsten had to lead a diamond to defeat this, as Levin would get a diamond ruff.  Not an obvious lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 15-0 usa1 this set|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ryskiel_: 100 czy 150 nie ma znaczenia w impach|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e kto wie jak jest po japoñsku "wszystko jedno"?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5 level belonged to opponents - so South will try 6 level.  She may be expecting something more distributional for 3@D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: the story i heard   the original notes used ZZ as place holder  but so many people saw draft it was too late to come up with better name|pg||
nt|joanem: good lead - may have to take heart finesse now - that works too |pg||
nt|lechcold: sam impas kier jeszcze nie robi gry|pg||

nt|chmitty: just a little help from my friends :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: maybe @S was for @C's|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: @S7|pg||
nt|chmitty: maybe ... but you can't do all with one card : give count and give a preference signal as well|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: right...|pg||
nt|chmitty: id dummy as a singleton @s then preference is the priority|pg||
nt|chmitty: here ot's not so clear|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lechcold: niestety 2BA wypuszczone w  55|pg||
nt|joanem: hard to get to that dummy of course |pg||
nt|april7: N doesn't give up, and S will be in 3NT and will probably finesse for the @C Q and go down|pg||
nt|april7: E should play the 6 and then the 8 of @C!!|pg||
nt|panosk: me and few more fellow viewers :)|pg||
nt|panosk: will claim soon|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lechcold:  5|pg||
nt|reisig: That @c 2 = underlead the @d or a fring squad with be here:)|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: now some relay systems refer to AKQ points or just 321|pg||

nt|pawel90: po pikowym te¿ mo¿na próbowaæ wyrzucaæ trefla na kiera... i traci siê tempo.|pg||

nt|viren169: Within 5-10y most serious Partnerships will have it in thier kit-bag.|pg||
nt|eamongall: I have a vague memory that some of Gazilli ...is linked to Benito Garrozo |pg||
nt|eamongall: let me google |pg||
nt|viren169: Yes... Invented by the Italians... adopted by the yanks!|pg||
nt|viren169: Can I say yanks?|pg||
nt|viren169: England off to a great start this morning...|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Now Willard's only chance of bringing in the @Cs is cashing from the top|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how did Bocchi field that PASS??|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|drorp: Israel defended and doubeled in both rooms on board 21, setting by 2 tricks both contracts, for a 13 imp swing|pg||
nt|timb: a kibitzer has pointed out that the save gains exactly 1 imp; well spotted jhfavre|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: this will be discussed in the postmortem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impressive|pg||
nt|petergill: 23-0 now because |pg||
nt|westjava: @HQ to pitch @D loser|pg||
nt|eamongall: A complex method of rebidding after a major opening and forcing 1 no trump response|pg||
nt|april7: imo the finesse of the Q of @C is an automatic move!!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|meargent: however gordons lead shouldnt bruse declarer|pg||
nt|eamongall: you just did ...so guess its ok |pg||
nt|viren169: Can be played without the forcing NT....|pg||
nt|viren169: Anyone interested... send me an email and I will forward it on to them... |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Unless you play for @CQxx onside|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: other room also stops in 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: to see the results of a board you can go to the running scores and then click a match|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: then select the board number and it will show all the results of that board|pg||
nt|joanem: there now |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sorry missed the trump play :(|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but 4C  allows to check on club honours - always going to play in diamonds |pg||
nt|meargent: i predict new leaders:(|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|chmitty: good start|pg||
nt|chmitty: now she has to guess whether the @h 8 is "sincere" (from J8) or not (from J87)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 4, Peter Newell received a friendly @s lead to queen and ace in 3NT|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like @D tricks will not go away.  In fact declarer must draw trumps to avoid @DQ entry and @H ruff|pg||
nt|kit: of clurse declarer thinks clubs 6-2, so he ducks to break communication -- giving the defense a chance.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|xenya: now he will just take his 7 tricks, losing 1 imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but easy to understand Cullin being worried about 12 tricks in 6N|pg||
nt|blewah: 1@d will disappear with @h |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: I agree with Avram though|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: now @D9 will take a trick|pg||
nt|joanem: oh ok |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sorry imissed play...i will claim at the end|pg||
nt|joanem: ran 2nd trump to dummy;s 9 |pg||
nt|joanem: then heart finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the answer should be 8 tricks unless declarer makes 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69:  2 down|pg||
nt|sharkey: From East's point of view the void in pd's suit a negative - turns out nothing wasted in @S and the hands fit nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: so a club now will defeat this|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: wow, that is some result in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: so she better leads a club or this hand will cost 14 imps|pg||

nt|petergill: With @H 5-1, 6@H is doomed and 6@C looks best - hard to reach 6@C if S rebids 2@D and clubs becomes the 4th suit in the auction|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S was enough I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Brown explained double as take-out|pg||
nt|viren169: still a few back to Sweden (I guess)|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like take out ...but when pard advertising 21 hcp approx can be penalty|pg||
nt|copeyj: well this is not going to make very many tricks, it would appear|pg||
nt|timb: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|ritong: hoi harold|pg||
nt|panosk: and the boys http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=SF&qtournid=885|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos: or cue bids |pg||
nt|josj: even we have here...|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS playing mini-multi aka Wagner   i.e. always weak 2Major  no strong options|pg||
nt|alunand14: in OR, S opening 4@H|pg||
nt|panosk: really close matches there|pg||
nt|panosk: i think this will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: she did|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 3nt=denies 6 spades or 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: W: My bid shld have been double|pg||
nt|meargent: east= the ex sharyn kokish|pg||
nt|chmitty: il faudra laminer Inde et Trinidad ... et serrer le jeu contre l'Indonésie|pg||
nt|chmitty: une équipe qui joue très très correctement et est en passe de se qualifier|pg||
nt|petergill: but fortunately South rebid 2@C so they are on their way to 6@C|pg||
nt|blewah: previous board. the same 4@s contract but Neve in N led @c5|pg||
nt|blewah: in the other room|pg||
nt|westjava: very nice lead|pg||
nt|meargent: yes she did|pg||
nt|starkist: can duck 1 @h|pg||
nt|edou2704:  in some matches the score is already significant, nederlans is leading by 80 against iceland in BB|pg||
nt|chmitty: I bet a certain % of pairs would play at the 5 or 6 level with these cards, even in a strong field|pg||
nt|viren169: 3 schools of thought here... some play it as t/out and some play it as penalties... and the rest haven't discussed it!|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does 4@D agree @S ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|drorp: yep, as much as a slam hand can be boring, this one is quite boring|pg||
nt|josj: but for us Bulletin Editors, coffee is like fuel|pg||
nt|lokaty: ale z 3 2 1 czu³em, ¿e w szóstym bêdzie 0, mo¿e to dobry omen.|pg||
nt|barbyh: made 2 hts in the closed room, diamond lead|pg||
nt|barbyh: 9 tricks here in nt|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D to set up a GF |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: bidding tray is now removed because S needs more room for the @d length :)|pg||
nt|starkist: and the chutzpah|pg||
nt|chmitty: change the @c Jack into @s Jack to start with|pg||
nt|edou2704:  yes but what % ? slam is not good |pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not "recipe" how to bid these hands...|pg||
nt|timb: 2@H looks easier to make than 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: but not easy to reach|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: maybe upgrading East hand is the only way|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: with that many controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: 1@S to pewnie odpowiednik 1BA|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wyjaniono mi ¿e ta pierwsza wersja dasa mat to sposób wymawiania przez Japoñczyków "does not matter"|pg||
nt|lechcold: 4@H by³oby praktycznie nie do po³o¿enia|pg||
nt|lechcold: a przeciwko 3BA bêdzie jeszcze szansa|pg||
nt|mamos: Chagas presumably denied @d control now|pg||
nt|mamos: :(   |pg||
nt|petergill: then 3@C to show 4 clubs, GF|pg||
nt|barbyh: 6 clubs may have some difficulty|pg||
nt|copeyj: likely 3 tricks for declarer, but E/W could make 3N it hink if they could find it|pg||
nt|april7: everything works here, but still only 11 tricks available|pg||
nt|rmb1: The 5 level was looking a difficult place to be and they stopped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't matter on this hand, but switch Martel's minors, then ....|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Italy scored 6 on 21 bidding 4s|pg||
nt|kit: Does anybody know what the 2@C call is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) BAL  1/2/3 NV v V 13-15 else 11-13  4th 11-14  b) 10-15 (4)5+@D  c) 10-16, any 4441|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sry, was problem with loading this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's the last time i'll mention that|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Muller asked for the low heart very fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek made 5@D on 22|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok Rich even for conservative like me its aiutomatic|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1S just showed balanced minimum with less than 4 spades (maybe 3 with some)|pg||
nt|dburn:  no, butit won't go six down, so if Sweden can bid 3NT at the other table...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: przegralimy 4 rozdania, ale to raptem tylko 17 imp - wystarczy jedna atomowa...|pg||

nt|lokaty: +17|pg||
nt|meargent: carefull play will make this starting with quacking the @Hs|pg||
nt|meargent: no need now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I think North was talking to himself here making slam suggestions -needed a real perfecto|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: it was alerted|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lechcold: ale PAK zapakowa³ szlemika w 22|pg||
nt|petergill: The 23-0 scoreline looks like a typical All Blacks Rugby Union scoreline|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, they have a good chance at reaching 6@C if N doesn't discount his @S values too much.|pg||
nt|dburn:  whcih way?|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|timb: Neve needs to return a low diamond to hold East to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|timb: noy easy|pg||
nt|kit: I'm told it is just an artificial game force|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: I was remembering Rolands instruction not to be too critical|pg||
nt|reisig: That's my job :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South must receive credit here  for 1Nt was indeed a horrid spot and 2@S  much better|pg||
nt|ritong: t as rien, ma fille|pg||
nt|ritong: dis 5@d paisiblement|pg||
nt|copeyj: can be down 6 now but they would have to defend well|pg||
nt|copeyj: would be a funny flat board - 3N tick and 1@D down 6|pg||
nt|dburn:  no way for Smith to tell who has the last diamond|pg||
nt|copeyj: they are in 2@D next door|pg||
nt|timb: not easy|pg||
nt|rmb1: On board 7. the open room auction stopped at 5@D and West got a club ruff for -3. 12IMP to Netherlands|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: pleasant little hand with @H's 2/1  and @D ace on side etc |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant @H's 2/2 |pg||
nt|meargent: not to mention the 32 @C break|pg||
nt|westjava: to avoid dummy entry|pg||
nt|edou2704:  4NT seems to be the limit|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know what 2NT showed |pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like good bidding to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: south opened 1@D showing @H and thus they dived over 4S, here NS silent|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|ritong: well, mate|pg||
nt|chmitty: le fait que Est n'ait pas dit 2@h ne leur facilité pas la séquence|pg||
nt|starkist: too much handling I thk|pg||
nt|meargent: sorry carefull defence will beat this|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ryskiel_: nie wiedzia³em ,¿e tylu specjalistów od japoñskiego zsaiada na balkonie - nie mogê siê ogoniæ od kolejnych wersji  |pg||

nt|ritong: i guess we re done for the frenglish emergency|pg||
nt|starkist: so far not unblock the @h king is good|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I just noticed that bidding has continued- well South has great controls - the problem is that North does not have enough  for his bidding|pg||
nt|eamongall: so a hesitation double is penalties :) |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: after we will expect a fast claim soon|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bouncer: nice|pg||
nt|petergill: True, you need a 12th trick, so the play of 6@c will be interesting|pg||
nt|wstuart: They should be OK in 6@C; draw trumps, one @h goes on the @SA, and ruff teh 4th @D.|pg||
nt|petergill: Do you rely on @H 4-2 or do you ruff two spades in S hand, keeping @SA to control the suit? |pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I miscounted, there are 12 easy tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT 1430 |pg||
nt|panosk: needs some cautious tackling though|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphznz: yeah, ruffing 1@S is enough|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|grebrof: N has no problems with Ss @h-sidesuit|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer may decide to take a safety play in clubs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|starkist: could have won jack of @d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|alunand14: with 8 pts and 4-3 fit, what next ?|pg||
nt|viren169: lol...|pg||
nt|eamongall: and a quick double is T/O|pg||
nt|panosk: spade solved a problem to decl, think @c best from E|pg||
nt|rmb1: South showing she could have made 5@S if they had got there :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|timb: Declarer can draw trumps and set up a spade now|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lechcold: ³adnie|pg||
nt|kit: This is what he has done -- 4 club tricks will be enough to ensure the contract, and he guards against West having Q10xx.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panosk: pass from S looks overly passive, i think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphznz: seems playing @C A first and lost track now.. sorry...|pg||
nt|copeyj: 500 the hard way|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbgood: and down GeO goes|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am toold that he can still make it - i dont agree|pg||
nt|reisig: Next|pg||
nt|copeyj: but not any more|pg||
nt|dburn:  perhaps not|pg||
nt|copeyj: England gained 8 on b22 when Sweden tried 3N next door which went down 2|pg||
nt|dburn:  declarer can guess hearts now for down three, but England will pick up 5 IMPs at least|pg||
nt|dburn:  unless declarer doesn't play anything at all, of course, which may restrict the loss to the 3 IMP slow play penalty|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|xenya: the American EW have overbid slightly there|pg||
nt|jbgood: *told|pg||
nt|starkist: ohhhhh|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h3|nt|odysseus69: North realised he had done too much and baled out in time|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: they never overbid, overbid was if they bid slam here :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's their style to push for a marginal games|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can ruff with A|pg||
nt|odysseus69: those who laugh at 4 card major systems should always watch where partner cant support clubs|pg||
nt|blewah: but Gaviard shifted to @h not @d after winning with @cK|pg||
nt|blewah: so, another push|pg||
nt|panosk: home now|pg||
pc|cT|pg||

nt|petergill: 8 tricks in 2NT on NS cards = just right for NZ|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no just the hearts - 52.5%|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: but this is actually the BB final whilst the USA2-Holland both tables are ""eliminated""-lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: this should be a good plus for NZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 23 Drijver opened weak 2@H and EW sold out to 3@H|pg||
nt|eok: Been down all day, but from the main scoreboard you get updated scores. We're playing poorly but had a good win vs Sweden and are on BBO again now and on OurGame tonite. Did you ...|pg||
nt|eok: see my email?|pg||
nt|barbyh: north has to decide whether west has 6 or 7 clubs|pg||
nt|barbyh: if 6  north has to duck the first club trick|pg||
nt|petergill: even if there is a spade switch at Trick 3|pg||
nt|petergill: as is likely with E being almost entryless|pg||
nt|dburn:  final contract unlikely to be three diamonds at the other table - and whatever it is instead may very well be doubled|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a great deal - scope for a double game swing is there for sure|pg||
nt|panosk: low required from W|pg||

nt|drorp: 2 way CB action, planning to pass 2@D|pg||
nt|mamos: safe partscore|pg||
nt|drorp: once east bid 1NT he has guaranteed 4 diamonds because they only open 1@D with 3 when they have 44 in the majors, and with that east would support spades, so Gino chooses the safe ...|pg||
nt|drorp: 8 card minor fit as his partscore|pg||

nt|edou2704:  3@s should fail due to the bad @s break, Cronier made a good move with her 3@d bid|pg||
nt|panosk: unless decl plays 10 which i doubt|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like just make|pg||
nt|kit: This hand may look cold, but looks can be deceiving|pg||
nt|kit: If you get a spade lead, you don't know that spades are 4-4, and if they are 5-3 you don't have time to set up a heart trick|pg||
nt|kit: so you may go after diamonds for the ninth trick, which fails|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they are laughing very loud here about the bidding|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: ujn petit ballon d oxygene  il etait temps|pg||
nt|starkist: great slam|pg||
nt|chmitty: the 1@d opening may come from 2 or even 1 card in the Chinese precision system|pg||
nt|rmb1: In open room, they also played 4@S but declarer cashed @SA before taking @C ruff and West could ruff in with @S10. 4@S= 1IMP to Netherlands|pg||
pc|h3|nt|josj: yes but E should find a parking place for the 4th club|pg||
nt|jkotor: ano, 19 wpad³o w 2 ostatnich|pg||
nt|chmitty: hummm ... vite dit|pg||
nt|ritong: encore faut il les faire|pg||
nt|chmitty: je ne crois pas que ça gagne|pg||
nt|viren169: not may entries to South's hand...|pg||
nt|sharkey: This shud be 7 IMPs to US - North's artificial 2@C stole the suit in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: so even if diamonds would break declarer still with 8 tricks... but now probably will be down 3 al least|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yuval10: W wins with the K and play J@C and another one, then declarer will know exactly where KQ@d and Q@s are|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer isnt down just yet|pg||
nt|eamongall: they said ... it was very efficiently organised |pg||
nt|viren169: oh dear... this is not good...|pg||
nt|eamongall: good for sweden |pg||
nt|april7: its a better contract thogh, but I think N should have bid 2 @S, although she makes 10 tricks in @H!!!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|davidstern: Club club ruff with @HA and spade towards jack what can the defece do now|pg||
nt|xenya: i've received a few messages saying that it can be made -- yes, i see it now -- thanks|pg||
nt|garden2005: tylko wyjcie w kiera nie wypuszcza nadrobki|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: so now E nows: @s are ok, @h A and @h K are there, @c A is there, lets go for 6|pg||
nt|viren169: Good (safe) lead|pg||
nt|eamongall: I reckon another @H card is required in the North hand for GF natural|pg||
nt|eamongall: like the @HJ |pg||
nt|viren169: 1@H is enough with North's hand...|pg||
nt|eamongall: or the @HK|pg||
nt|alunand14: each other to be careful, because the segment of the crucial :)|pg||
nt|ritong: notice simons' cautious pass, at equal vulnerability|pg||

nt|edou2704:  cronier has to split her @c honors|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: nice play in @S -- just in case west started with J9xx    that hand shouldn't cover, but why not give defender chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|garden2005: no ale w meczu gra siê na obk³ady|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that East was too good for 3C whatever it showed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: A diamond lead would have been much better for the defence|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or a heart continuation to prevent a dummy reversal also|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am prepared to bet a coke that declarer will prevail|pg||
nt|davidstern: A heart now is best though|pg||
nt|yuval10: can still make with an intra-finesse in @d ( @d to the 9, followed by the J@d that crush the T )|pg||
nt|blewah: 8 tricks so far|pg||

nt|ahollan1: note for ZZ    downgrade singleton K  and Q(x)|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: ok, correction later|pg||
nt|kit: On this lead, however, there is no problem.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|josj: it can be ruffed after 2 rounds of trumps but I am not sure that is the best line|pg||
nt|edou2704:  or play @c :)|pg||
nt|eamongall: Cannot say too much here as Stockdale comes out and scrolls back the vugraph to see if anybody said bad things about her |pg||
pc|h6|nt|jkotor: dobry wist|pg||

pc|h5|nt|april7: sorry only 9 by good defence!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 9 of @H now for a spade shift|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|josj: declarer might as well go for both the finesses: low to the @SQ and low to the @DK and later the @DJ|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: you are right Jos..can be a danger|pg||
nt|josj: trump lead was excellent|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 5 hearts, 3 clubs and 1 spade obvious|pg||
nt|mamos: the Diamond switch has simplified matters |pg||
nt|petergill: S deduced from @H7 (choice of pip) lead that @HA was 100% for sure in East, so he could afford to play @HJ|pg||
nt|westjava: mb, to get a tenace @D|pg||
nt|blewah: cash out @s and @h and give @c|pg||
nt|westjava: yes|pg||

nt|mamos: The English NS played 1NT after a two way Club and a NT rebid on Board 7   and indeed the Indonesian defence took the foirst nine red tricks for a good swing and the match lead|pg||
nt|ritong: meyers va réveiller|pg||
nt|blewah: interesting choice of reopening|pg||
nt|westjava: fasten seat belt pls...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|davidstern: Hurd and Wooldridge are certainly slower than average|pg||
nt|jkotor: przez trefle chyba najlepiej|pg||
nt|petergill: Good auction by Kamil - Fleisher to 6@C: 1@h - 2@C artificial GF allowed S to show his hand to North, leading to 6@C|pg||
nt|panosk: dont much like E douvle withouth 4 spades , but just my taste|pg||
nt|panosk: *double|pg||
nt|panosk: is 2@H, @Hs and a minor?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: I think it is|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: lekko nie bêdzie|pg||
nt|mamos: not a very exciting hand|pg||
nt|wstuart: should make on the @C finesse now.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: am i seeing things or Did East really bid 3S|pg||
nt|chmitty: as we can see, EW have a good contract at @h mais none of the players cand bid this suit safely|pg||
nt|alunand14: yup !|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ryskiel_: ¿eby Piotr zapowiedzia³ 3 BA pewnie by dosta³ wist waletem trefl|pg||

nt|lechcold: kontrakt bez szans niestety|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and good save by USA|pg||
nt|petergill: This lead gives the extra entry for the black suit finesses|pg||
nt|kit: So normal 3NT down 1 in both rooms.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|drorp: good pass by chagas on 2@S, soft 15 count no realy chance of making game, and here comes the trump lead which is often the right lead in those kind of partscore auctions, specially ...|pg||
nt|drorp: with good holding in opener's 2nd suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver opened weak 2@D North   that will make it tougher for the Egyptians|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil's heavy 2@D bid may give deWijs problems|pg||
nt|jkotor: na pocz¹tek oczywicie|pg||
nt|mamos: two flat hands - declarer has to work hard  for her three NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: really|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: now probably a ruff coming|pg||
pc|d2|nt|reisig: OK ..talk to each other ..for a while :)|pg||
nt|petergill: An ultra-dynamic (Zia in his youth?) opening lead of @HJ might work wonders |pg||
nt|sharkey: West's 3@H shows a hand limit raise or better in @S - 3@S would have been more preemptive type|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead in other room|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: this should be a quick 1 down|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like no swing here|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, they stopped 2 levels lower -- but wrongsided|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes the CR had the joy of the @D10 lead from west|pg||
nt|ritong: et tout le monde aura fait son boulot|pg||
nt|meargent: i know that feragami and partner played that forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: But US bid 4@H OR so looks like 6 IMPs to US and r\the lead narrows to 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|timb: She is now|pg||
nt|ritong: the total number of losers has brutally shrinked|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: Cullin won't go -3 now|pg||
nt|edou2704:  EW have a good @h fit, but not so easy to find when Willard bid 1@s, some would double 1@d|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@H seems conservative to me then |pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: but N might continue with the @CQ now|pg||
nt|edou2704:  she could have reopen 2@h also|pg||
nt|panosk: nice loser on loser to cater for @d not 3-3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lontoh 63: what happen other room Henry?|pg||
nt|ritong: lost connection|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: Henri|pg||

nt|blewah: Murniati went down in 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  for those who are enquiring, we do not know whom the winners of this match will meet in the semi-final|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|ritong: encore faut il les faire|pg||
nt|ritong: 9?|pg||
nt|ritong: i doubt it  no sweat|pg||
nt|timb: @DQ did not threaten declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: note Fallenius 3rd seat "multi" 2@C opener which includes a weak 2@D hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H was reached in other room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East bid sensibly in OR - first showed clubs then splintered in diamonds|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: now ok |pg||
nt|westjava: 10 imps for 3nt = -1 other room, previous board|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: hoping to pin W's 10|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: west thought very long before ducking the @cK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lechcold: z tej samej|pg||
nt|drorp: diamond switch was necessary now though, but hard for east to know that dummy's clubs gonna be good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mcavoy did well to stay out of auction   cullin won't be able to read distribution|pg||
nt|meargent: thof course the 1@D opening lead to a very playable contract and a probable 1imp pickup for canada:)|pg||
nt|ritong: intraitable|pg||
nt|wstuart: I tihnk a low @H, cashing 3@H and then exiting a @D would also work.|pg||
nt|starkist: ok will fax my planet with the info, thx|pg||

pc|s8|nt|kamyk: wysokie blotki we w³aciwych kolorach - na to nie ma systemu (chyba, ¿e Garden cos wymysli:) )|pg||
nt|meargent: some  pairs play that after a transfer a simple raise is forcing|pg||
nt|zhoufly: 2dÕýºÃ|pg||
nt|zhoufly: Êä1imp|pg||
nt|kit: Cashing 2 diamonds first would have worked out better for the defense|pg||
pc|s7|nt|meargent: come on lynn get a move on im getting bored:(|pg||
nt|panosk: N shud have ducked that|pg||
nt|kit: This sort of hand is generally easy to defend.  When you can see declarer has 8 top tricks, you know partner must have what the defense needs.  Thus, East  "knows" west has king of ...|pg||
nt|kit: hearts, and West "knows" East has aces of both black suits.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|drorp: making 10 tricks|pg||

nt|timb: @H9 must be a wrong card|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, no big deal|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna neve has played the trump 7|pg||
nt|timb: @H7 allows declarer to play @Hs for one loser|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: right not the 9 but makes 12|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: should be ok here   won't take 2@D tricks, but ruff @DK with natural trump|pg||
nt|chmitty: moment of truth|pg||
nt|dburn:  if Indonesia beat USA2, the winners here will play Indonesia|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: I will correct..|pg||
nt|kit: I do not believe Martel discarded a club.  That is absurd.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphznz: 8 tricks now...|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: may be extras|pg||
nt|mamos: i think declarer had to win her red tricks there and exit when the defenders would have to concede the ninth trick|pg||
nt|mamos: as it is ..............|pg||

nt|viren169: I am reminded that I did say it was -2!|pg||

nt|odysseus69: this has been a good session for conservative bidding -a camp where I still belong-|pg||
nt|viren169: prbably 4@H here|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2NT is a game forcing raise|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C is natural |pg||
nt|panosk: this a bit easier than last |pg||
nt|rmb1: The sort of values that lead to 3NT in the modern game |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 3@S alerted|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: all of you 2/1 players out there -- make sure you talk with partner about what South's rebids show here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 21 points and 2 balanced hands- cant even contemplate game|pg||
nt|meargent: that lynn doesnt give up easily|pg||
nt|sybarra: and palmer to bid 2 @H now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think e/w dont let them play before pressing clubs one more time |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N asks, which type of hands are included in X|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Narko 3 karo?|pg||
nt|starkist: 5@c down on @d lead tho|pg||
nt|chmitty: very lucky slam if you bid it here|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think 3@D asks shortage if I remember correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: nie mam jak widaæ ale mam co lepszego|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  does 2@S guarantee 6+, does 3@C guarantee extra points and/or 5+@C,  etc|pg||
nt|reisig: A likely Puppet auction|pg||
nt|joanem: interesting raise to 2h because of bad spades i guess and diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: south took a very low road|pg||
nt|meargent: easts preempt did its job|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D says you pick major pd|pg||
nt|alunand14: good decision not bid 3@S, but 4@S, so that Tueje not dbl :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Madala is too young not to use science here :)|pg||
nt|kit: This is a good start -- now South raises, and North can drive it in.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|odysseus69: and now?|pg||
nt|reisig: 1 try ...and out|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, 2@S was stop call|pg||
nt|ritong: okay, @ds are not promising, but rest is fine|pg||
nt|chmitty: needs both @d and @h 33|pg||
nt|chmitty: @s and @h sry|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@h shows already 5 cards in the suit|pg||
nt|chmitty: I believe Sylvie will bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|edou2704:  in other VC matches : usa2 +40 vs indonesia ; england +35 vs sweden ; netherlands =13 vs usa1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who play it   would 5@C be Exclusion KeyCard??|pg||
nt|kit: I generally don't like leaping to slam, but truthfully I don't see an approach Madala can take to find out about a grand, and he will surely bid the small.|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: east decided to upgrade his hand to an 18-19 balanced hand, not sure it would be my choice, but rebidding 2@C isn't that appealing either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me   south hand is either a 2@S or 2N rebid depending on partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is not good enough strength or shape for 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @S9|pg||

nt|odysseus69: maybe 4C is natural - some play that 3S over 3H agrees hearts and 4C is just natural|pg||
nt|edou2704:  netherlands +13 vs usa1|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure what any of this means, to be honest|pg||
mb|3H|nt|meargent: it probably will make:(|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT superaccept, 3@H re-transfer|pg||
nt|sharkey: West elected not to x as pd passed hand|pg||
nt|panosk: N played last as if she knew all 4 hands, tough to compete with that|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry meant N i open room|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt seems best |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: 3 clubs to loose..and 2 spades...anything else?|pg||
nt|josj: trump lead cost a trick...|pg||
nt|josj: declarer can now advance the @HQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: pinning he 9|pg||
nt|josj: if she ever gets to dummy...she should, in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: the 9|pg||
nt|josj: yep...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easier to play NT - this will take longer|pg||
nt|joanem: but remember the gals are faster|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: lol|pg||
nt|joanem: i woudl expect hearts to be breaking 4/2 after the X and be less likely to raise hearts  to 2 - also like my 5 clubs for nts|pg||
nt|lechcold: znowu szlemowe rozdanie|pg||
nt|starkist: actually @d down on @c lead|pg||
nt|meargent: not that i would do so with that east hand too strong for me|pg||
nt|starkist: 3s was left over chutzpah|pg||
nt|odysseus69: another hand where biddin too much costs- I dont think North hand qualifies for 2C|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not easy for Tueje to x|pg||
nt|panosk: spade now |pg||
nt|rmb1: Board 8 was flat in 5@DX-1|pg||

nt|petergill: Tough lead for West ...|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: howdy|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think 4@h-4@S now perhaps|pg||
nt|copeyj: just 4@S and that should end matters|pg||
mb|4D|nt|xenya: this will probably make -- foe 5 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|petergill: I guess the longest suit @H's has least to lose?|pg||
nt|wstuart: Many pairs will bid a doubleton as their preaccept - unless the doubleton is the suit just below their trump suit which would prevent pard from re-xfring|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S still looks doomed, even after this lead|pg||
nt|edou2704:  4@s is a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|edou2704:  for our vugraph who is doing a great job, in BB netherland +75 vs iceland|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: hmmm...|pg||

nt|viren169: Q. How may partnerships can break a xfer seq in their system over 2N?|pg||
nt|sharkey: previous hand|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the longer it goes on, the more worried the England supporters will be|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: probably 3d was some sort of club raise?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: cover to encourage @C finesse??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and i think same @C/@H layouts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   bad joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: might lead a heart first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difference in other room though   @S to Queen Ace, lose @C, then @SK @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if the Q loses, then try @hA to see if the J drops|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and if not take the @c finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: good start for the defence|pg||
nt|eamongall: a spec reckons Brown and Stockdale want to play every contract .. |pg||
nt|viren169: dont have 4 losers but dont have 10 tricks here either |pg||
nt|viren169: South will probably try and ruff a @C and pitch one on the @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: the delay in the 4D bid suggests a possible doubt about the meaning of 4C - maybe I am completely wrong|pg||
nt|wstuart: Leading from the K in the 4 card suit is a little safer than lead from the Kx or the Kxxxxx.|pg||
nt|april7: now E will make 8 tricks|pg||

nt|wstuart: that will get them to 6@S.  However, east is going to bid slam himself, and west will likely raise to 7 based on his likely source of tricks in @C.|pg||
nt|petergill: When playing against opponents who play a Forcing Pass over 5@D, maybe 4@d causes more problems for EW than 5@d does. I know it's normal to preempt to the max with a good fit, but ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D - 4@s makes East guess if West is stretching to bid 4@S or not. |pg||

mb|p|nt|drorp: i'm assuming east bid 1@H to show spades, west's 1@S shows 3 and up to 15 count or so, 2@D is the 2 way CB again, any GF|pg||

pc|h6|nt|yuval10: 6@c looks like a decent contract which makes on a good day. not today, though|pg||
nt|xenya: but if they do, 6@C is clearly better -- looking at the NS hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: south was reaching for 3@c over 2@s, but put it back|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2nd negative perhaps?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: lool|pg||
nt|odysseus69: either major works|pg||
nt|westjava: when can not?|pg||
nt|blewah: if they play lebensohl or some sort, that 3@c is weak|pg||
nt|ritong: well, perhaps the @s lead will turn out good, if raise is not possible|pg||
nt|starkist: and a 4 card major on the side|pg||
nt|meargent: notice souths pass under 20 points is an automtic pass after partner makes a pre emptive minor raise|pg||

nt|copeyj: this is not the sort of deal sweden need i don't think|pg||

nt|barbyh: not a good result|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: looks like 1100 and 16 imps USA|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps EW were worried about bad breaks, given how high NS bid on so little|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here 3c is 1 down but it gives N/S a chance of a plus if E-W press on|pg||
nt|viren169: and West with a 4333 min wont go on|pg||
nt|eamongall: 52-3 in imps this set ... they gone into the lead by about 12 |pg||
nt|eamongall: think its time to fire up a 2nd laptop as I am staying here to watch Stockdale and Brown |pg||
nt|ritong: at first sight 3@s is a make, so this slightly offtrack opening seems to lead to a positive result|pg||

mb|1S|nt|meargent: 1@C 1D! 2NT 3NT ?|pg||
nt|edou2704:  5@hX -2 in other room, a good result for france|pg||
nt|chmitty: an agressive 1@s overcall by Feng pushed the French to the 5 level here|pg||
nt|eamongall: but Italy can do massive imps when the going gets tough |pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: 1NT in this vul, pass in opposite vul perhaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  3@D-DBL-P-4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: check that   3@D-DBL-3N-4@H-end|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie wiem, czy w tej sytuacji pomóg³by nam nawet kamieñ milowy:(|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1@d shows both majors|pg||
nt|edou2704:  fir china sorry|pg||
nt|chmitty: Lu will be puzzled ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Don't think S will invite to game here so likely a push...|pg||
nt|ritong: downsides are you immediately cancel 3NT and lisome about defensive potential, upside is it could be opponent's hand and they have less room to move|pg||
nt|ritong: lie some*|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like I was wrong.  4@S was a making contract despite 5 losers :(|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H is some sort of responsive flannery 54 in spades and hearts ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: I cannot reaad the explanation, but I certainly won't mention the F word when Roland is around|pg||
nt|rmb1: It is possible to play 1D-2H as a weak hand and 1D-1S-then-2H as forcing with similar suit lengths|pg||
nt|rmb1: spec confirms 2H = 5+@S 4+@H 4-9HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|meargent: ahh a convention|pg||
nt|starkist: or let me merge|pg||
nt|viren169: Good result from the Open  Room here|pg||
nt|eamongall: Anyway back to Stockdale and Brown ... and their Swedish opponents |pg||
mb|3S|nt|drorp: i wonder if south will invite to game, i wouldn't on a vul 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: wow|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what now for North?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: splinter?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: well...she is thinking|pg||
nt|joanem: splinter |pg||
nt|ritong: alerte= garantit 4 cartes|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think with AKQxx in @C, that west was at least good enough for 6@H, if not 7@S directly.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and 1NT did work better putting me in my place|pg||
nt|odysseus69: again 2H = H + minor |pg||
nt|odysseus69: now because he bid ast time with a 7 count he will know that partner will not be doing same- |pg||
nt|odysseus69: he may bid 2NT to ask for minor then ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: quite usual defence against strong clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: X not alerted S (but by N)|pg||
nt|copeyj: England lead by 58 with 6 boards to compare - and b27 doesn;t look like swing potential|pg||
nt|panosk: disaster in board 26 for France|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphznz: mee too, but its a board crash|pg||
nt|lechcold: tu Martens oceni³, ¿e ma górê otwarcia 2@H|pg||

nt|joanem: she sure thinks a lot lol |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: what about 6@c?|pg||
nt|meargent: on 2nd thought 6@Cs?|pg||
nt|mamos: this wont be a success though|pg||
nt|mamos: unless North does something odd|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N asks now already for 2nd time to E if 3@c is really a 6+ card @c; YES|pg||
nt|kareno: The pass by Dianna Gordon could prove expensive on this deal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no upgrade for those nice Clubs?:)|pg||
nt|drorp: i mean i would bid game directly|pg||
nt|mamos: ah :)  that I agree with :)|pg||
nt|drorp: 2@h slightly wild, but in this vul and with pretty solid trumps, it's not dangerous (although i dont see an upside to it aswell)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north hand not getting better|pg||
nt|mamos: nope:(|pg||
nt|ritong: les américains sont légèrement plus procéduriers que nous|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's easy looking at all 4 hands, I know, but surely he was worth at least a try with that @C suit.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South will bid on for sure|pg||
nt|panosk: i like 3@S|pg||
nt|rmb1: South feeling pre-empted by 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pawel90: jak otwieraj¹ do 8 punktów blokiem to zdecydowanie mia³|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 3@h not alerted yet @@ SW side|pg||
nt|meargent: i am sure the KOACH has taught them some very scientific methods over invered minors|pg||
nt|meargent: 2@Hs was conventional|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobry bon mot Lechu - ju¿ podkrelam wê¿ykiem!|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze, ¿e mamy trochê przewagi nad goni¹c¹ nas Japoni¹|pg||
nt|petergill: It depends what 5NT and 5@H would have meant over 5@D and I don't know what 5NT would have meant|pg||
nt|meargent: could?|pg||
nt|rmb1: More specs tell me it is a favourite of West. indeed it is the "Bessis convention" (avoids the f-word :))|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Declarer has gone for a toilet break|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the open room, the Dutch tried 4@H (-1) on board 11, 6 IMP for France|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: That leaves the NS pair pondering about the previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: bior¹c pod uwagê z czym otwieraj¹, to mo¿e i mia³:(|pg||
nt|kamyk: ³adny motyw - niedawno opisywa³em podobne rozdanie|pg||

nt|starkist: pard passed 1@c what to do, jump in at 3 level|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S makeable but is it biddable?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Now it is dummy's turn to leave the room :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: puppet to 2@D useful tool|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT best but 4H probable |pg||
nt|jkotor: w 26 w Open remis na 6@s, trochê inny styl ni¿ w bryd¿u damskim|pg||
nt|kamyk: dzien dobry (dobry?)|pg||
nt|granguru:  started unblocking|pg||
nt|kareno: I said that before south (obviously naturally) passed.|pg||
nt|timb: Over the years I have found preemptive style is very much a personal style; I'm a very aggressive bidder but  a less agressive pre-empter|pg||
nt|ritong: there also are tactical considerations|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ryskiel_: Kalita ze wzglêdu na trefle nie powinien pytaæ o asy - po 4 kierach jak sugerowa³em chyba by stanê³i w 6 BA|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: hurd asked about the diamond length of 1@d before bidding 2@d. 1@d = 4 unless west has 4432|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek's 3@D backfired|pg||
nt|lechcold: -5:(|pg||
nt|lokaty: tak czy siak, dok³ad przed parti¹ z tym to moim zdaniem gruba przesada.|pg||
nt|joanem: 4c?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: with a club more and a heart less slam would be good -South not interested -the spade suit was a dampener|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzieñ taki sobie Karolu:(|pg||
nt|jkotor: Danusia siê niczego nie boi!! kto jeszcze wszed³by z karty N?|pg||
nt|lechcold: szansa na 5 punkcików|pg||
nt|petergill: As is his usual style, Mike Ware goes for blood against the weak 1NT |pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont believe that- N orth did well and South could hardly have any more|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder what 1N showed|pg||
nt|ritong: when you are on a rush, for example, you may want to brutalize opponents more than usual|pg||
nt|ritong: even more, that is|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: not sure dbl at N is the right decision . but ok, I can understand|pg||
nt|mamos: just making sure partner knows your suit is Hearts ?:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Better to open that rag because it is 5/4 with good cards in your suits.|pg||
nt|meargent: and that tony is the argument for passing that north hand|pg||
nt|starkist: I open light and pass that hand|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @D shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: to have a chance to defeat this...|pg||
nt|panosk: as opposed to 4@C that some may prefer|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos: not going to take long to play|pg||
nt|drorp: he has 5 and a half defensive tricks, he wants to play 2@H double if south has a hand that planned to pass either 2@s or 2@d|pg||
nt|mamos: quicker than I could type it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could be the worst lead for defense|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this match so far has been all about bidding - and thats where the points come from|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 3@H explained as 5+@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@S inferior to 1 NT so likely 1 or 2 IMPs to US here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Could go down with prefect defence |pg||
nt|sharkey: *perfect|pg||
nt|kit: N-S just plain overreached here.  Too many tripletons, and lack of 4-card side suits.|pg||
nt|kit: Levin should continue with small heart, not queen.  If he plays queen, Weinstein may think it KQ doubleton, and with no quick entry overtake.|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein's play at trick 1 is suit-preference here|pg||
nt|kit: So Levin might find club shift on that information|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: @DQ 2nd worst|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Cullin will be punished for his DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was going to be hard for Upmark to find @C lead either way|pg||
nt|timb: I think 4@H is too much; 2@S engenders cooperation (and I a fan of the Bourke/Wolff/Landy game try method - bid a game and then try to make it :))|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: this will be only 3rd non-overtrick swing|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has to duck|pg||
nt|kit: And so he does.  Good example of the value of suit-preference at trick 1.|pg||
nt|kit: Club shift almost impossible to find without that.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphznz: South looking at me, trying to see how it goes I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which puts declarer under most pressure now   @C or @S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: divine guidance or the other kind?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they dont seem to agree|pg||
nt|petergill: If @S9 was played from dummy, Geo Tislevoll would have ducked  |pg||
nt|wstuart: The weak NT sort of force the action.|pg||
nt|wstuart: You can't sit back and pass with your own strong NT, so you have to get in and DBL and the IMPs can start flying in either direction.|pg||
nt|petergill: On paper, this is the strongest NZ team I've seen in ages. Last year there was a controversy when this NS pair were not selected in the NZ team after they came in the top three ...|pg||
nt|petergill: pairs in Pairs Trials. |pg||
nt|viren169: good effort!|pg||
nt|rmb1: After board 11, NS will be determined to cash 3x AK :)|pg||

nt|kareno: I open light and open it.  Live by the sword, die by the sword.|pg||
nt|edou2704:  oh ! very good for china|pg||
pc|sA|nt|meargent: this is a good canadian slam @Cs and @Ds breaking with @DK onside|pg||
nt|jkotor: jakie 5 punkcików? w obronie 5@c?|pg||
nt|kamyk: po grze wielu obecnych bryd¿ystów sportowych widac, ¿e nie zaczynali od gry na pieniadze:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  if North thinks on a bath coup..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lechcold: wydaje mi siê, ¿e 4@D by³o niedobr¹ odzywk¹. Pomijaj¹c fakt, ¿e nie dla wszystkich musia³by to byæ forsing:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zgadzam siê, ¿e 4 BA jako naturalny inwit by³o lepsze |pg||
nt|joanem: happy to run it to the Q in 4, but.....|pg||
nt|wstuart: Many DBLs at IMPs are actually more defensive in nature - you have to protect potential game scores in other contracts rather than trying to kill the opps.|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's really rather rare that you simply know that the opps have made a big mistake.|pg||

nt|ritong: when east is marked with @c AQ10|pg||
nt|yuval10: right|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he will pmake this effortless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not only did action in other room make it easier to get to game, but also helps play the hand|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: she cant tell her hand at 3 level now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: so if you want to bid, you have to do it the first time you can (also a lesson)|pg||
nt|starkist: I would expect extreme distribution to jump in later|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: you may not have a second chance...|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree - the safest time to get into this auction is the opening bid.|pg||

nt|barbyh: very lucky game to make|pg||

nt|sharkey: In OR East bid 2 NT to describe NT shape and strength of her hand - cud perhaps also have bid 4@C - if this had shown Majors|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @HQ smother jack  needs extra entry to dummy to pickup suit for no loss|pg||

nt|ritong: next|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you can make a slam against minimal values such as KQXXXX @s K@c A@d then you better do a move towards it|pg||
nt|chmitty: bid 3NT with EW cards is not a success of a strong club system, but let's see what happens here|pg||
nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|april7: although 4 @H are in, that might be the end of the bidding|pg||
nt|april7: nice trial bid, but with 3 losers in @D W will only bid 3 @H I suppose|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@S now and make EW guess?|pg||
nt|kit: matter of style|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: here both N treated their hand has a 7-carded, quite natural when partner is passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D could have game force strength but 0-4 zz|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphznz: eas has 7 tricks...so coffee hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Bermuda Bowl  for Iceland   after  2@D [weak major]  Jonsson bid 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: ofc it's just a small chance - why not go for it?|pg||
nt|kareno: There's nothing more than a possible IMP on this board.|pg||

nt|sharkey: Timid by the American ladies....?|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 hts seems a bit understated|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: again for ina ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@H minimum|pg||
nt|dburn:  so this is a minimum|pg||
nt|panosk: doesnt cost i think|pg||
nt|rmb1: South agreed with a spec who thought 3@S was enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was going to say Kit knows the style more   but the bid was already posted|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yuval10: W took some view to leave 3@h X with 4-4 @s fit|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H puts real pressure on EW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Newell and Reid have relayed to slam here|pg||
nt|pawel90: 4@s chyba nie idzie po kierowym|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not the ideal dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  hand 11 will be on defensive bridge books on 2012|pg||
nt|chmitty: ils ne sont pas partis pour en tout cas|pg||
nt|petergill: Japan in 11th, only 6 VP from 8th..... 8 teams qualify after 21 rounds|pg||
nt|blewah: 1nt is forcing so 2@d is 3+|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c transfer to @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@h ? I don"t know :(|pg||
nt|edou2704:  2h may be transfer, and 3h fit in @s to play by partner ?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 1@S instead of DBL??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that clever ruse  let them buy the hand in 3@S|pg||
nt|meargent: EW need to find their @C ruff 2 beat this highly unlikely|pg||
nt|chmitty: elles pardon|pg||
nt|ritong: fine spot|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure what 2N was...|pg||
nt|dburn:  natural and optimistic|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like an obvious pass to me...|pg||
nt|dburn:  but West may have thought it was something else|pg||
nt|dburn:  and this is a so-so game missed - non-vulnerable, one tends not to push so hard|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: OR they are is 6@s|pg||
nt|rmb1: South now considering making the last guess (I guess :))|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lechcold: 4@S wygra lekko...chyba ¿e zostanie postraszony przebitk¹ karow¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: i zagra piki z góry|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: board 29 +1 will correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Deas-Palmer play  "mini-multi"  aka Wagner   i wonder if either of them would have found the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|petergill: BB: Favoured teams from Poland and Bulgaria in 14th and 15th have very little hops of qualifying|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib points out 5@D also a make|pg||
nt|panosk: they seem to be heading there too |pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: but it's a double-edged sword for sure...|pg||
nt|antoniz: po karowym te¿ nie idzie|pg||

nt|meargent: good agressive biddings by NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west should have been worried about this happening|pg||
nt|granguru:  and in the newspapers tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i think they say 1d with 4-4? so that bid showed 5H|pg||
nt|ritong: jill levin aime son jeu|pg||

nt|chmitty: ça doit pas être ça|pg||
nt|ritong: pour ma part je ne raffolle pas des as secs, mais bon|pg||

nt|ritong: ton please|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is gonna be hard to make!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he fancies NT rather than 4H - 2nt is too high|pg||
nt|panosk: dont know what 1@S is in open room from N but it sure isnt spades :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: I mainly lead offensively and I cant say that I have lost on it - I think its the same with these players: its better to lead something you have than lead something you dont want ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: your P to lead back - it is also easier for your P when it comes to defending if your leads are offensive|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: ns was making 2s..|pg||
nt|pawel90: bêdzie bura w domu |pg||
nt|ritong: we are nervous:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: excuse moi|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|viren169: the dble of 3@C was a bit too early...|pg||
nt|dburn:  but Brock's @dQJ turned out to be useful cards, a fact she could not really appreciate|pg||
nt|timb: I hate opening 1NT on the East cards; but nothing else is better|pg||
nt|april7: E has no other choice than to bid 4@H!! and it works!!|pg||

nt|starkist: time for the queen to play her queen of @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did she have a non-forcing way to show @D? |pg||
nt|meargent: @D lead gives EW a chance|pg||
nt|blewah: should be made, i think. even with that bad break of trumps|pg||
nt|panosk: Q@S asking S shud give maybe |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't see anything in CC to explain non-use of negative dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: maybe they play DBL denies 4@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the other room, I foolishly suggested that there was no scope for a disaster on one of the boards we have still to see. Of course, I was proved wrong. Learning nothing from my ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: mistakes, I will make the same prediction here.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: n will surely bid 2@s|pg||
nt|ritong: it seems so, yes  dummy is high, except trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: King from KQ or AKx|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: well cashed for an imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  but since CC says neg => 4@S  i would expect entry to show it does not apply here|pg||
nt|ritong: phew|pg||
nt|chmitty: @h switch and one or two off|pg||
nt|eamongall: I guess Sweden don;t open 14-16 1Nt with any 5 major .. |pg||
nt|ritong: also, you know that it will be duplicated other room|pg||
nt|ritong: very likely|pg||
nt|timb: true|pg||
nt|april7: @H @D @H @H @D and finish111|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: privet vlad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H did go down    making Sweden on wrong side of FOUR slam swings this match|pg||
nt|mamos: and the defence should prevail|pg||
nt|wstuart: but it is possible|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think west will exiat a @C now|pg||
nt|petergill: Mike Ware follows the approved Mike Ware plays of "when in doubt, put the opponents on lead"  and "put them on lead so they can make the mistakes"|pg||
nt|chmitty: but still few Imp's to the French|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

mc|12|nt|xenya: bounjour Henri|pg||
nt|mamos: loads of tricks now|pg||

nt|starkist: oh the opportunities|pg||
nt|panosk: South sorry|pg||

nt|granguru:  @D8 asked for a @H return, as there was a great danger of losing that trick in the @C suit length|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sounds like my kind of guy - except for being fun, handsome, and a good bridge player.|pg||
nt|wstuart: '|pg||
nt|wstuart: lol|pg||
nt|blewah: Murniati 1 off in 2@s when Cronier made it here. 5 imps to France|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: players scored 110 when South claimed but i think it will be 90...|pg||
nt|ritong: obvious raise to 2@s, imo|pg||
nt|rmb1: France opening up a lead. with 2 boards and final set of 16 boards to go|pg||
nt|grebrof: I was sure that wasnt going to happen :D|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|drorp: some lazyness from Gino there, it's not like they're 20 mins late...|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess a fit jump to 4@h was unavailable...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: forcing or semi-forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Palmer will now show 4-fit  but i don't know their step responses|pg||
nt|ritong: and there we stay|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@s easy - 4@H hard work|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: first in the restaurant for dinner?|pg||
nt|grebrof: how old are these guys anyway - I know Israel has a lot of talented juniors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone will rue balancing|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table, in 4@H, declarer needed dummy's low trump for a spade ruff (the way the play had gone). Rosenberg made the good trump lead and continued trumps at the key ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: moment. Declarer had to win high in the dummy but played the four and then ran into a trump promotion.|pg||
nt|vugraphznz:  board 30 corrected|pg||
nt|starkist: 5 level at risk|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 6 minutes playing time left|pg||
nt|meargent: in this room NS might even be more clever and stop in 4@Hs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: weak Nt getting extensive run|pg||
nt|april7: now a slam try is possible and if bid good guesses are very necessary|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D some sort of heart support |pg||
nt|panosk: maybe a bit beter point wise from striaght 2@H|pg||
nt|panosk: *straight|pg||
nt|panosk: thx indeed for your help |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: This boards not helping much the Neatherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|lokaty: Seniorzy odbili sporo i wygrali 20:10, a Panie te¿ ju¿ trochê odrobi³y i na razie 11"19|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N =    unexpected|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: that was a nice pass by N, if he X then his side might've run into some big troubles|pg||
nt|ritong: fine move by north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this mechanism means they'll have lots of room below game to learn no slam|pg||
nt|starkist: other room south must have got bergens mixed up to go slamming|pg||
nt|petergill: Lead now 36 imps after Newell and Reid beat the 4@S then bid the grand slam|pg||
nt|wstuart: The lead was from teh other side on 4@S - the @HA was lead and there was no inference to be drawn as to the location of the @SQ|pg||
nt|edou2704:  tea time already ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: its past midnight here and I have an 8 week old daughter having her first flu  - sorry - not sleeping enough|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: very few imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most pairs that play transfers would bid 1@S with 3-fit and weak NT|pg||
nt|kit: I think if Levin bids 1NT and then pulls to 2@C that shows minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: he will not claim this one|pg||
nt|kit: Apparently I have it wrong|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: needs guts to do that|pg||
nt|xenya: good decision by N not to compete further|pg||
nt|jbgood: GeO was not as tempted as Lall at the other table - and passed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a useful 8 to the Kiwi with 1 to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has 4 tricks in the side suits and needs to add six trump tricks.|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d 4SA|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d shows @h|pg||
nt|rmb1: South's choice over 1@S would have been harder if partner had bid @H.  Do you just bid NT and hope defence don't have 5 tricks in the unbid/unstopped suit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|drorp: interesting choice by Gino here, deciding to go slow so he can represent his shape, rather than making a wild preempt at a big level (like 5@D :))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek's PASS looks much better to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs is known for his agressive bidding in competition, doesn't let the opps play at low level|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably forcing|pg||
nt|joanem: 4s is aggressive thought she woudl bid 3s after 1n|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no bad breaks so no problems|pg||
nt|starkist: splinter|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure about this|pg||
nt|ritong: rather a cue with @s fit|pg||
nt|copeyj: Sweden bid 6@H on 29 next door too - well done to (presumably) flatten the board|pg||
nt|copeyj: aggressive opening, but don't forget N/S play precision so openings limited|pg||
nt|ritong: simons applies " no way they play raised 2M quietly"|pg||
nt|panosk: that the reason why as i was told, they play 2@h = transfer for @s|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@d simple fit|pg||
nt|panosk: 1 thing i can tell you for sure this fight will be exciting till the end so dont miss next 2 sessions today |pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: south must feel he hasn't shown his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: by at least a king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  1N-3N   makes more sense to me|pg||
nt|granguru:  and even if it werent so, it shows a great defensive hability by the E player|pg||
nt|ritong: ou 2SA mini maxi|pg||
nt|blewah: or @s raise, Henri?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - S kept it open and launched EW into 4@H...|pg||
nt|panosk: in hearts|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|starkist: sharyn and dianna were 4th in the butlers, some consolation, good try|pg||
nt|viren169: another flat bd... |pg||
nt|dburn:  maybe - a heart lead might have left declarer guessing a bit|pg||
nt|viren169: the trump lead wont do any harm to declarer|pg||
nt|viren169: Decarer will set up the diamonds for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|timb: I'd need to be on some severly mind altering drugs to double 2@s for takeout on the West cards|pg||
nt|timb: This is down two|pg||
nt|ritong: i m not scandalized|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and another partial|pg||
nt|grebrof: the dutch girls need a big swing soon|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: almost impossible i think|pg||
nt|kit: won't be a problem with club finesse on|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so East could bid 3@H on the next round.|pg||
nt|grebrof: I can agree|pg||
nt|grebrof: the french ladies are also in a streak, winning several big events lately - both mixed and female honoutables|pg||
pc|dA|nt|drorp: Gino and Ronpa are both in early 30s, Gino ex junior for many years, i used to practice with him alot back in his junior days|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: what a lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: surprize lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H was 1 down but 130 better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice confident stop|pg||
nt|ritong: indonesia in the right contract again|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@S by Sjoberg a good bid - Rimstedt should bid 3N now I should think|pg||
nt|copeyj: and they have protected the @D tenace|pg||
pc|d4|nt|starkist: push, nice little win for Canada against titans|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: oeps|pg||
nt|ritong: pas d états d âme chez jill meyers|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS very acdtive OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: *active|pg||
nt|alunand14: how do you think about this board, Carl?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mamos: two or three specs have pointed out how ell EW Brock Smith are playing - I think thats very true - they certainly were heading the Butler for the Venice Cup last night|pg||
nt|ritong: surprenant|pg||
nt|petergill: "handsome"? I think Mike himself might say that he's only handsome when you compare him with the meagre standards set by other male bridge players|pg||
nt|starkist: I might open 1@d with north hand|pg||
nt|panosk: local times for next broadcast here http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphznz: N asking about bids W..|pg||

nt|copeyj: for Venice Cup running scores|pg||
nt|copeyj: the foul @C and @S break dooms this it seems|pg||
nt|panosk: shud make with this lead for sure|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|drorp: Ronpa is a big talent but started bridge somewhat late, so he missed on the junior circuit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would bet that Sadek is in the minority and that most won't be able to resist balancing DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: needs to lead a trump to beat this, i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since the auction is forced to game, it can be difficult for the players to know if partner has extra values. 3NT is an important bid on the way to a major-suit game. The Serious ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT shows extra values during cue-bidding, the non-serious 3NT denies them. You can play it either way. |pg||
nt|starkist: not the dream dummy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: no doubt he has seen partner's openings brfore|pg||
nt|grebrof: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD6tdEG-7lc|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and so he did :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: no, sorry, @dA is onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H 2@C @C ruff @DK|pg||
nt|ritong: retour de 11 permissionnaires, donc|pg||

nt|odysseus69: West likely to have 1 king - if spade king all well - if diamond king then play for K10 or doubleton 10 with East|pg||
nt|timb: I'm with Mike Lawrence and Andrs Wigren; the so-called "Law of Total Tricks" is nonsense; a fraud and an emporer without clothes|pg||

nt|petergill: I doubt if Bach - Cornell (2 big names of NZ bridge) have ever been possibly the 3rd (or =2nd) pair in a NZ team ever before |pg||
nt|petergill: Last board - whatever happens on this hand, a very well played match by NZ - a splendid effort by them under pressure|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: and a possible last swing|pg||
nt|starkist: oh yah one more board, will put the beer cap back on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if EW wanted to save   East needed to bid over the artificial 1@H  but if unable to show 2-suiter  she was stuck|pg||

nt|ritong: well, if we are at that, and if you have good french, an idea can be to purchase jean rené vernes " bridge moderne de la défense"|pg||
nt|ritong: as a document|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd 16 boards  start in 1 hour 40+ minutes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yuval10: with what looks like a good result for Israel, when 4@h is cold|pg||
nt|ritong: that would tie the match  not sure 2 imps is worth 1 VP|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder how 4@H went down in the OR|pg||
nt|ritong: relatively naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: north led a @c, ducked|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't have an indication from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: then grue draw @h A in order to avoid a possible guess later|pg||
nt|ritong: then the roof fell on him|pg||
nt|yuval10: here it looks like South would bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Americans have been a disappointment to me in this match - but quite a long way to go before the KO stages|pg||

mb|p|nt|drorp: pachtman had very good hand for hearts, but didn't realise the 7-5 distribution, looked more like 6-5 or 7-4|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: muller not opening strong club here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H actually could be 5@H 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: with 5-5 they rather open the Major first, before they are being preempted to 4@s|pg||
nt|pawel90: szlemik nie jest ³atwy|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when they said  you can't preempt with 4 of other major or a void  they forgot to say it was no-no with BOTH|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand   better to show suits|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this is the last board of the set.. |pg||

nt|drorp: very tough slam to bid, based on the 10 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hardly Chagas "duty" to bid slam, but I guess S has one more bid if Chagas can dig up some @d-support|pg||
nt|mamos: Will EW pass if he bids 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: woow..the french team are looking for english blood at the 1 level|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: wyniki kobiet: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-venice-cup|pg||

nt|kareno: Spade shift now for the money.|pg||
nt|viren169: South not good enough to leave it in...|pg||
nt|viren169: now 2@D... what the difference between this seq and 2@d instead of the dble?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: the next session will begin at 13.45CET (in about 1 hour)|pg||
nt|panosk: and to all of you for your comments and contibution, thx vm|pg||
nt|kit: Shouldn't be a problem now.  On clubs lead, might be another story.  |pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: Kevin was our great operator, apologies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1@H with 5@S may just apply to 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs passing, probably expecting 2@s with Muller, since the opps didn't overcall 2@s or raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good stop|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: that 5@C overcall is somewhat -- er -- exotic... |pg||
nt|drorp: great stuff from Chagas|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll never know|pg||
nt|drorp: passing the 4 level, impressive|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree - very good bid|pg||

nt|edou2704:  cronier bid 3@s due to the double fit |pg||
nt|copeyj: but 4@S will not find a way home I don't think - at least down 2 on this lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwny rebid Yokoi (2@S zamiast 1BA)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D forcing checkback|pg||
nt|petergill: NZ 7th now, 3.5 VP behind 5th and 8 VP ahead of 9th. Aus 8th|pg||

nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer can get 3 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 spades, and 2 clubs before defense gets 5 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ryskiel_: jeszcze dziwniejsze 3@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s now ( more likely than @d ) means 4 off|pg||
nt|jfanha: vão perder 16-14 em vez de ganharem 18-12...acontece aos destemidos barrativos desta vida...|pg||
nt|drorp: partner went over 4 level, how can he not have 2 aces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have been weaker hand with @H/@S  [or strong with one minor]|pg||
nt|lechcold: w protokole rozd 32 w Open jest pomy³ka, proszê siê nie stresowaæ, to jest remisowe rozdanie:)|pg||
nt|wstuart: I was asked what I think of this US team.  I like them a lot.  There are no weak links in any of the players.  I know every one of them personally and I think they have as good a ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: chance as any team in the event.|pg||

pc|cT|nt|alunand14: trick 12|pg||
nt|alnanda: chance to big imp for indonesia :)|pg||
nt|barbyh: bojoh should make this|pg||
nt|sharkey: Very aggressive x by Debbie.  Janice decided not to take out.  Potential gain +50 - downside -470|pg||
nt|alnanda: with @s break 3-3 2@h is cold :)|pg||
nt|barbyh: agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: As kibs we see all hands - not as easy at the table|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chmitty: remboursement des 11 Imps précédents :(|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H right contract dont think S though of higher  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the shift shows why Bocchi did NOT lead @S    picture Stansby with @SJ and you give declarer extra trick|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lokaty: "nie ma zysku" jak piewa³o "KOMBI":(|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ryskiel_: sztywna nadróbka|pg||
nt|barbyh: very aggresive bid by west|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade switch would work well, as it happens. Then South could put two spades through. |pg||
nt|petergill: in 3rd seat, weak 1NT opening is not used by the top experts - hence this standard-style auction by EW|pg||
nt|blewah: Indonesia will play Morocco in the last round while France vs. Trinidad and Tobago|pg||
nt|ritong: merciless, i tell you:)|pg||
