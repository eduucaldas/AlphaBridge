mb|2D|mb|p|nt|djneill:  East doubles to show 4+@s (1@s would deny @s)|pg||

nt|danilo1: most of my (serious) bridge careet, I played in Italy :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: x shows @s|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok North chose to reopen with 2@s rather than double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning from the beautiful Poconos.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  the major suits are indeed quality|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: 2@S by North is kind of ... Mixed events bridge|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: apparently he can't :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|djneill:  I hesitate to bid 2@s though since South chose not to bid 1@s (or anything for that matter) over X|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: this trump suit is quite interesting|pg||
nt|queequeg: the open room started right now :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barbyh: clubs are well placed for East|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: if you know east has the ace, the percentage play is small to king, then duck on|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok North doubles the third time and thankfully South likes this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: CATTANI - BRIDGE BOLOGNA RASTIGNANO  after 3 round is in 9° position with 36 points - Lavazza first with 61 points|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: duck one|pg||
nt|chmitty: we can see that 3@h is a make so you must defeat 2@s|pg||
nt|chmitty: best lead for defence|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|athene: that gains against @HAx and @HAxx with east, and loses only to @HAJx|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|djneill:  here, count is most important (how many spades will cash), so South will play a low @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: they can open their @c trick, added to 1@h, 1@d and 3@s|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|chmitty: 5 only losers but I believe declarer will run short of trumps too soon|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|barbyh: but not enough entries for the second club finesse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: of course it would have been harder after a club lead then three rounds of spades, with west threatening to overruff dummy :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barbyh: perhaps west might have bid 2nt to slow the auction down|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: i guess east was going for singleton spade with partner but that was a bit of a long shot i think|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 11s dble promissed @S .. someting is wrong with EW system ... why should notEast be able to Dble for penalty - and if so agreed, why than West does not Dble instead of 3@D ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: (already promissed 6-cards) bidding 2@D free|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: declarer can eventually get to dummy with a diamond ruff and play a heart to the jack, i suppose|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so West should probably cash the @dA here because North has at most 1 diamond, it might be the King, but West may think South has all the diamonds, in which case, not cashing the dA is better so as to have the end position better|pg||
nt|djneill:  but for sure, West cannot pick up all the diamonds, North will not have a doubleton on this auction|pg||

nt|bebechira: 2c obv forcing|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: another good decision by Lavazza - could dbl giving the minors, but vulnerable isn't a good choice|pg||
nt|athene: not exactly what east wanted to hear|pg||
nt|chmitty: East hoped to play in a 44 major fit|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chmitty: for communication reasons you may win with @h ace and play a small @s|pg||

nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|s8|nt|santyclz: In 2/1 this hand might have been more fun.  2@c by n, 2@s by s, p p ? (double or let them play?)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|djneill:  not sure what the 2@d is, maybe it is a 3 card heart raise|pg||
nt|danilo1: anything alerted here (North hand is not reverse) ,,, so 2@D bid looks like style in Polish Club ... or eventually Fiori Romano|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|barbyh: its 2 am here not quite awake|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|danilo1: but maybe, South treated her hand as three-suiter|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: say @DQ, @HAK, then if both defenders follow but no @HQ appeared, you would go @SA, spade ruff, @DA, spade ruff, but you need something very good to happen in spades|pg||
nt|chmitty: In French we would say "ils ont été pris avec les doigts dans le pot de confiture"|pg||
nt|ritong: or east, having felt pain with 2NT previous hand, did not want to inflict the same to her pard  very noble|pg||
nt|athene: a slightly odd hand here in that the defence do best to attack declarer's five-card suit, rather than their own :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: "caught with the fingers in the marmelade pot"|pg||
nt|athene: of course if declarer guesses the @SQ she is home anyway|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: ok so east prefers to just show a good raise right away rather than doubling|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok brd 1 worked out for Nardullo when E-W in the other room bid to 3@s on a 4-3 fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to have a look, if you have the methods|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ryskiel_: in Poland very popular was conventional 1NT in defence bidding, which show 5m+4M|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  1@c roman, 1N positive but NF|pg||

nt|ritong: the idea is to find @ss, and at max level|pg||

mb|3C|nt|djneill:  24 HCP|pg||

nt|danilo1: * or polish @C|pg||
nt|djneill:  6 sure tricks, 1@s, 2@h, 2@c, 1@d|pg||
nt|athene: a good example here of how a 4-4 fit can produce more tricks than a 5-4 or even 6-4 fit|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s looks healthy at that point|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  @c is likely to come in if 3-3 or @c honor sing/doub|pg||
nt|chmitty: One solution is to adopt a double relay sequence (2@c limited and 2@d game force) in theses situations|pg||
nt|chmitty: these*|pg||
nt|chmitty: everytime the 2@c bid is "free" (not only after a 1NT rebid from opener) you can use it|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@h isn't automatic, but it gives pd a chance to raise on a borderline hand with 3 card @h supt.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chmitty: there it sould go : North 2@c, South 2@d (forced) North 2@h : around 10 Hcp with 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: A quite good 7@s : you make 13 tricks in the 44 fit|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|chmitty: think about it : of course it has a few inconvenients, but so many advantages :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: When @s are 32|pg||
nt|athene: yes, pretty much needs 3-2 spades or stiff jack|pg||
nt|athene: if you cash the @SAK and east shows out, you can pick them up, but it's no use|pg||
mb|4C|nt|djneill:  since West led 4th best @s, probably West has no other 4crd suit so no point to finessing round 1 I think|pg||
nt|athene: because you can't get a ruff in either hand for the thirteenth trick|pg||
nt|athene: of course it's a good job north is playing 7@S :) otherwise lightner double would be quite effective|pg||
nt|chmitty: Very tough bidding exercice with  natural methods : when you have discovered a @h fit, you hardly can investigate an alternative one in @s|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: well, it's not certain by any means they will find even the small slam in the other room|pg||

mb|3C|nt|djneill:  hmm, we saw something like this earlier, 1@c...2@d on a roughly balanced weak NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|athene: at least 500 if south passes this|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence time it right they can get 800 because south gets a spade ruff and then north leads the fourth spade to promote the @DJxx remaining|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4 card majors it seems... i will not say acol|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: if south bids 3nt that is likely to end the auction though|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: and it looks like they missed game|pg||
nt|chmitty: Note that most players would rebid 1NT with North's hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: This rebid does not promise a @s stopper|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chmitty: What do you bid with xxx Kxx Qxx AKJx ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  not convincing but they avoided the spade spade ruff, @d, ruff|pg||
nt|djneill:  in @h|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure about agreements - thk North should be stronger for 1NT bid|pg||
nt|djneill:  this is perfect for 3NT, despite two 4-4 major fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: may be old Albarran Canape?|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  lucky :-)|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so the @d8 must be 3rd best, so North can reason that ducking is probably correct - very likely East has the Ten|pg||
nt|danilo1: since ew 4@H is -2 on the lead (whoever leads) ... and 1@S is not obvious overcall, this may be swing board|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ritong: one reliable guide could be: first target is 3NT|pg||
