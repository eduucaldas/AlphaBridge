nt|ahalim: this has been a see-saw battle so far, Indonesia winning the 1st session and England the 2nd|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: so a few imps for some overtricks on Board 1|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphznx: Hi Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Last session of the day now|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4 world champions facing the Indonesians|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|yorkbeach:  Hi Mike, any news on the ruling from the last set? Julian|pg||
nt|mamos: an aggressive t/o double from East |pg||
nt|mamos: as we would expect|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hlortz: here we had a pretty routine texas to 4@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North sure to come again|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this inv migth lead -to 4 @h -2 if they find ! ruff|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS will just see how many of their "winners" will cash|pg||
nt|westjava: good save in 5@D|pg||
nt|mug: correction direct from Aylesbury on that point, Barry's giving them time off to watch the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Sally Brock's 2NT shows a good @S raise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H i mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with 4+ in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: just overtricks at stake - time to get some tea :)|pg||
nt|mug: Heather might have reopened with a take-out double here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: this looks pretty difficult to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S losers and can only afford 1 @C loser|pg||
nt|ahalim: can prubaly make on an endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: run the @c 9 after eliminating @s and @d looks best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can maybe eliminate @S and @D |pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room Dhondy led J@C |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|alnanda: 1S LOSSER DISCRAD WITH q@D|pg||
nt|mug: 2NT was minors, also fairly reasonable but swapping plus for minus|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: at some point in the game|pg||
nt|mamos: several specs ask about the ruling from the last set   does anyone onsite know the outcome|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Heather too busy but everyone bids more than me|pg||
nt|mug: lucky not to be bigger minus, both South and North might have got hold of 3@D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|don_kapu: what a brave bidding|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but 3nt look like will make|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mug: Nevena would have left a double in, 2@S is one off|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
nt|szalay: 2 or 3 off|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|ahalim: but decl might place the @CK with W because of the overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the discard doesnt do much good except aid the elimination|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mug: but I can imagine Heather feeling that defending doubled partials was not the way to go at the score|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT a more attractive spot than 3D - perhaps pass by East was better option|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  system card for EW http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||

pc|h9|nt|alnanda: lead @s big problem for declerer|pg||

nt|westjava: ohh sry, that was a phantom sacrifice I think:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Another potential 3NT?  EW may not bid at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: W didnt do well actually|pg||
nt|mug: took some defending though, the defenders need to clear their club trick before declarer sets up the long heart|pg||
nt|szalay: easy looking 4@H is coming|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 8 out of the blue|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: south did though|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|runnerup: now a real 0akeable game on 3nt  and will be bidden i presume|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: you can play the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|ahalim: alas we shall never know|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: means running @c9 afterwards @cQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: makeable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double only cost 3 imps and was worth the possible psychological gain if it worked|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: why would you do that unless you see all the cards?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: dropping W s jack|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|runnerup: a alm here 6nt /@d /@c |pg||
nt|runnerup: slam|pg||
nt|rmb1: I was wrong about adverse vulnerabilty silencing EW :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: because it is close between the precentages of an intrafinesse and leading towards the Q|pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt US could gain in this style|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|runnerup: some misunderstanding perhaps|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: the 3@D response was constructive, with a bust he would have bid a lebensohl 2nt|pg||
nt|hlortz: dummy's trump are a bit disappointing but we can see that the aggressive style from usa2 has paid well --so far|pg||
nt|mug: good afternoon Jack|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D is xfer, no doubt|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 5 ruffs and 2 aces?|pg||
nt|rmb1: The first set will has shown that there will be a battle on every hand in this match, no chance to relax|pg||
nt|mug: E-W are playing strong notrump, 5-card majors|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphznx: W just didn t open ;)|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: X denied @ss|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|runnerup: yes i see|pg||
nt|westjava: random from card generator?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: both tables playing weak nt - common happening in England but not elsewhere|pg||
pc|s4|nt|szalay: generally better to play from STRONG side|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mug: 12-14 NT rebid and 2@C checkback Stayman|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: if she doesnt rise will need to guess clubs but I expect Ace|pg||
nt|mug: Dhondy needs to rise ace here, I think she's likely to do that as she's cold if hearts divide|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|barbyh: big red cheeks and black hair, thats about it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting the threshold that players set for a 2-level overcall these days|pg||
pc|sK|nt|runnerup: timing has not been best possible -when game is on you are in partial and wise versus|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably 2@c was a forcing enquiry|pg||
nt|mamos: defence have four tricks if they can organise |pg||
pc|c6|nt|lontoh 63: hi all|pg||
nt|mug: even low would have been ok, she'd have been forced into rising king at trick three|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: 2@c Gazilli has been much in evidence in these championships|pg||
nt|szalay: he must play for @S later or (better) sooner|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup: i see -slam not so clear -but makes this time|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  with clubs 5-5, the @s trick is not running away|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahalim: the indonesian players were once coaached by Kokish, that's why they play weak NT|pg||
nt|alnanda: @h blocked''|pg||
nt|ahalim: this has no change at all|pg||
nt|mamos: West hast to overtake and play @sQ to defeat I think|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|alnanda: with no information, i think same result with other table, can't find Q@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: additionally many Ws will put in @cK if you lead it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yorkbeach:  but the ruff is ...|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|rmb1: I am told "EW are in their late 20's, a product of [the Indonesian] bridge goes to school programme"|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|westjava: you are right, Robin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer needed to try and score small @H with spade ruffs, now -2|pg||
nt|westjava: we call it BMS (Bridge Masuk Sekolah = gridge goes to school)|pg||
nt|westjava: *bridge|pg||
nt|rmb1: South must have something for her double: so North could play a trump to @HA|pg||
nt|mug: but ace was correct, no reason for North to lead away from @DK on this bidding|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mamos: but the Club ruff might|pg||
pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: West has to hod her cards up and of course not fly with q of diamonds- oops|pg||
nt|ahalim: although @H's are blocked|pg||
pc|d4|nt|szalay: @D now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahalim: but can discard @H on the @D|pg||
nt|alnanda: other room NS play 3 NT make +400|pg||
nt|rmb1: But timing is on NS's side, they have two chances to draw trumps (now or later :))|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: hm, the tables dont seem to be connected|pg||

nt|ahalim: made in the end :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello|pg||
nt|mug: so noone has anything in the locker, just 13 more board of bridge, we think Arifin?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H from West? |pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@S C turned back to 4@S + 2 |pg||
nt|szalay: btw 2nd trump by South instead of @C wd be stronger defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: this was black start from n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: commentator please|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes tricky - because if North bids clubs strongly, NS are likely to finish in 5@c rather than 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: in the OR the Indonesians played the first three tricks in the way needed to defeat  -- but then West continued Spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: that|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H not exactly classical with four spades on the side, but what do you suggest?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|szalay: practice 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: here normal handling in 1s lead to 12 tricks in @h (or nt ,but that is wrong contract)|pg||
nt|hlortz: well suit quality of weak 2's has gone down over the years|pg||
nt|wstuart: A common treatment is to play 4@S as a strong single suited hand after a weak 2 opening.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hlortz: martel will likely buy it for 4@S -1|pg||
nt|wstuart: That looks likely.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: in @s|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and all pass for 2@S|pg||
nt|ahalim: only half an imp extra for England, which the program cannot show|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mug: an excellent bid of 3NT, some players would double but you don't really want to heart partner bid clubs, let alone diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok for me but I bet that there will be some 4H bidders|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok turned back to 5@S +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: io so cape maklum lah ....... kondisi begini yang kuat stamina yang bisa main bagus ,tapi sama2 US juga pasti so cape |pg||
nt|ahalim: omg a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not always nice to play in a 3-3 fit |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if EW had bid and raised @d, East might lead the @d2 as suit preference|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: declarer should cash @CA at trick two, plain sailing from there|pg||
nt|ahalim: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=SF&qtournid=886|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: partner opened and you had 19 hcp -may lead to slam|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphznx: will have to put in the scores manually|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a more straightforward make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting choice by declarer in the @h suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wstuart: Not much to te play on this one I think.|pg||
nt|ahalim: for people who are interested in the score per session of this match|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphznx: + 2?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d was missed by ew -but it can happen in many secvenses -|pg||
nt|yo_yo: happens a lot when 1NT forcing and west is forced to rebid longest minor|pg||
nt|mamos: easier for us of course because we know Spade honours onside|pg||
nt|blewah: hi Pak Arifin. is this the official score?|pg||
nt|mug: Smith made the maximum in the CR, so declarer has to pin the @S10 or manage some kind of endplay to flatten the board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now should start spades from dummy or Ace and small spade|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps @DK next to guarantee the contract?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes Q of spades works but swop Ace of diamonds and spade king and a bad idea|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lontoh 63: don't know how many degree on there but though cold now|pg||
nt|mamos: but looks like making even if declarer loses a trump a Heart and a Club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to decipher the NS leads - presumably declarer knew the @hQ was offside|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|h2|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: not really|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: S then must have had @hA|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but it would create a 2nd entry to dummy|pg||
nt|westjava: will they reach to 6?|pg||
nt|hlortz: cue bids here...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wstuart: 4@C is likely a control bid in that suit, however, it may show a min range in HCP;  they may play a serious 3NT which would show more HCP and then let opener continue the auction.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahalim: evrybody starts bidding :)|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|mamos: 10 tricks for West|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|odysseus69: here West had close decision and might wel have passed 3C|pg||

mb|p|nt|alnanda: realy she play 10 @h  luc ??|pg||

mb|1H|nt|runnerup: 5 1c really makes ,but i doubt that they will bid less |pg||
nt|ahalim: slam time, this time not so difficult to bid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 6@S or 6@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: she claimed for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5@C hinges on the guess in @D |pg||
nt|yo_yo: DEwi shows both majors|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S do you think?|pg||
nt|mamos: there may of course be an appeal  we don't know but at present England lead by 11 more imps than is shown here|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 5 @c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think she lost 2 hearts 1 spade and 1 club|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: i believe Stockdale said wrong card|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and nicola will bid  what|pg||
mb|2H|nt|odysseus69: once North flew with heart ace there was 9 tricks|pg||
nt|alnanda: lost 2@h, 1@s,1@c and ruff @d|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now the road to 6@H or 6@S is opened wide after a 4@D bidding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: X might indicate @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|dgame: 7@d for -5|pg||
nt|szalay: another boring game, 5@Cx=500|pg||
mb|4H|nt|runnerup: 150 looks very normal here|pg||
nt|alnanda: 7@d :) ??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|alnanda: -6|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: e did not open in OR so 4@S escaped w/o X|pg||
nt|wstuart: -2 looks about right here.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahalim: only 6 down|pg||
pc|cA|nt|alnanda: for 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maximum 6 down = 1400|pg||
nt|mug: very aggressive upgrade by Heather Dhondy, the five-card suit is good but the stiff A-K not so good|pg||
nt|mug: decent contract but the minors lie badly |pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahalim: this bidding is truly worthclass level|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who will Nicola play for @D?|pg||
nt|hlortz: maybe -1...|pg||

nt|runnerup: some overbid  -but that happens -even 4 @s is down - also 5 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: E deeply in thought|pg||
nt|mamos: The English NS pushed EW uncomfortably high here but 5@S made seems like a push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in the OR NS competed to the 5-level at the favourable vul but EW judged successfully to bid 5@s|pg||
nt|anton72: need a minor shift now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahalim: when E shows up with the @S A, Nicola will guess the @D;s I think|pg||
pc|s8|nt|blewah: @d return to force a guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: WEst made a vulnerable bid so is maybe favoute to have ace|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|runnerup: in 4 @s defence should be like @h  lead -@s to Ace and @c .to beat it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahalim: worlclass|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on shapely deals like this, having more aces is important|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes WD nicola|pg||

nt|mamos: anyone's match|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|wstuart: Looks like the @D spots are going to get crushed out and he will only lose 3 @D tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|wstuart: Luckily, N doesn't have the @DT or he might go -2.|pg||
nt|mug: she could have set up the long club I suppose|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@d must be showing 1 or 2 4card M|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: but who can argue with success Victor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT = a good raise|pg||
nt|blewah: 2nt mixed raise i think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D - 1 or 2 4 card majors|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wstuart: A @D lead will beat it 2 by force, but that's going to be hard to do.|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  unless trumps are 5-0, declarer can count 10 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4D - game only - both majors|pg||

nt|mug: South has a good dummy for 1NT doubled but she may fear East also has a long running suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: South might just pass quietly|pg||

nt|szalay: no doubt 1st trick was @D to the Queen, taken|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: quickly down|pg||
nt|dgame: 8@s is really a good card|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  tough for East - West might have a 5th @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: pass is forcing to redouble|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cards very friendly for 4H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yorkbeach:  @d ruff is in short trump hand but hard work to make|pg||
nt|mug: good judgement by Nevena Senior not to play 1NT**|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blewah: 3nt is normal although 6@c looks good|pg||

nt|mug: that would have worked well but South could have had bare king|pg||
nt|odysseus69: jack of spades best chance but easy for north to duck|pg||
nt|mug: I think she can get home double dummy|pg||
nt|mug: @SJ ducked then @SA and a spade|pg||
nt|mug: diamond ruffed, spade ruffed and @CJ pinning the @C9|pg||
nt|odysseus69: then diamond|pg||
nt|mug: does that work?|pg||
nt|mug: but North's out of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn:  certainly jack of spades ducked, heart to the ten, diamond ruff, ace of spades, spade will work|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted - missed by me- and being bombarded by better analysts|pg||
nt|dburn:  but I don't think anyone would play like that|pg||
nt|mug: that doesn't rely on doubleton @C9 but does need spade 3-3|pg||

nt|anton72: indonesia in 3 @h in OR|pg||

nt|dburn:  at the other table East bid 2@d to show majors, so North-South never bid clubs at all|pg||
nt|mamos: or perhaps it will :0|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: or @h 5|pg||
nt|westjava: odd and strange|pg||
nt|ahalim: the operator bid like that|pg||
nt|blewah: 1@d 15-17 bal or 11/12-15 unbal|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: it was just the final contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  choices of 4@c, 5@c and 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: -6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dgame: dont play @s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: skinny game - well done|pg||
pc|h8|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: brown is looking very weird when seeing the dummy|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West would like a @s lead|pg||
nt|blewah: how did W infered that @s?|pg||
nt|anton72: looks like we all can get a last 4-5 boards in the most tied match ....Italy lead only 3 imps |pg||
nt|mug: needs to draw trumps or @S8 will be promoted|pg||
nt|mug: don't see how else she might reasonably play though|pg||
nt|mug: scratch that, @S9 is big enough |pg||
pc|h5|nt|westjava: ok|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok operator error,  easy to do when they play fast |pg||
nt|westjava: every body so tired there|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the operator in the OR just had some difficulties during the bidding :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, South bid 1NT rather than double, so she does not have spades, and North bid the minors so she does not have spades|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn:  so maybe East has spades, unless the dealing machine has eaten them all|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|alnanda: still down, but must perfect defense |pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: this is going to be passed out :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed it was, though I would have thought East could bid 3@s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|odysseus69: defence better be careful - as long as West ducks first diamond East can warn partner off spade return|pg||
nt|don_kapu: according to my brother hood, this is pancake board (flat board)|pg||
nt|westjava: @S9 lead other room|pg||
nt|ahalim: I think blewah shd become operator once|pg||
nt|westjava: tied money policy, moneter crisis, don|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as a passed hand, South cannot be much better than she is. who would be bidding 2@c rather than 1NT?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|don_kapu: flat board|pg||
nt|dburn:  still time to take plenty of tricks for the defenders|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|alnanda: Q@h !!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blewah: raising directly @c would have work better, it seems|pg||
pc|s6|nt|blewah: i don't think i would be strong enough to do it oom Arifin|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe 1 imp for England|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok then pls don't say operator's error|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe the toughest job in bridge|pg||

mb|2S|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|dburn:  this game didn't have to make at the other table, did it?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: a playoff that is with less boards than the finals|pg||
nt|westjava: u r right Paul, the others I mean|pg||
nt|dburn:  South may have a chance now, if 3@c is natural (as it should be)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North has the right sort of shape to X 2@s but not enough values|pg||
nt|mamos: south might dbl and N bid Clubs|pg||
nt|mug: I wonder why Dhondy didn't upgrade this hand to an opening 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  I guess it did, once South led a spade|pg||
nt|alnanda: @s lead|pg||
nt|blewah: what is 3@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  but North had not opened, so South didn't know what to lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but about 1,000 IMPs have been lost in this tournament so far by people who cannot bid the opponents' non-suits naturally|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: and having bid 2D South should run when doubled|pg||

pc|s9|nt|blewah: i see|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: i think that  pass by S   "timid"|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West's 1@c is either clubs or a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  and that, in times when both 1@c and 1@d are frequently short suits, is really not very sensible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would get an alert where I play|pg||
nt|szalay: gotta go, bye all|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

pc|dK|nt|alnanda: next world championship 2013, Indonesia to host , we must prepare ourselves as organizers and achievement|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, maybe. But if East had held the ace of clubs and West the ace of hearts, 3NT doubled would have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well maybe East would have led a heart - we can maybe all day - I am too old and cowardly to want to be in 3NTx on the N/S cards |pg||

pc|hT|nt|don_kapu: 6 imp ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might have reopened wih 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn:  they will have a singleton only when 4=4=4=1 precisely - but they will have a doubleton quite a lot of the time|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mug: some pairs simply don't open 1NT with a 5-card majors, for example the three pairs on the Italian open team|pg||

nt|dgame: dewi is digging it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in reality a fractin less than 50% - 6-1 club break - not massive - reduces it a fraction|pg||
nt|blewah: N could have tried 2@c though|pg||
nt|blewah: 54+ in minors|pg||
nt|ianmcc: best to settle for -200|pg||
nt|ianmcc: take 6@d & @c|pg||
pc|s9|nt|westjava: ABCC in Bali 2012 is open tournament|pg||
nt|westjava: so, this board will be push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South did not fancy a weak NT in third seat vulnerable with 12 - not sure of the logic for preferring 1@d to 1C though|pg||

nt|don_kapu: how do you when it is right or wrong ? law of The Egg of Colombus|pg||
nt|dburn:  and declarer kept all of North's diamonds and then misguessed the suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer got the @d wrong at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn:  so that she lost four spades and one of everything else|pg||
nt|blewah: continue with @c now?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: not sure I understand the OR bidding - East did not appear to be doing enough but maye 3H was a max or min over 3C -some play this and 4H is in middle|pg||
nt|don_kapu: in Depok, this bidding style we call Dewi Persik Digging|pg||
nt|don_kapu: sdh finisse again @d, |pg||

nt|blewah: and repeated here|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ok|pg||
nt|dburn:  not in practice, but fortunately that does not matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|alnanda: welcome blewah...You come at the right time, seeing results, the indonesia audience can release the tension with drink BLEWAH with ice and syrup :) :)|pg||
nt|dgame: yes, |pg||
nt|yo_yo: SAlly  will win and take her winners|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 5@D 1@H 4@C = 10 tricks, am i right brother westjava|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: normal choice of lead|pg||
nt|don_kapu: so many chat to me and i will repeated it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mug: Indonesia missed 4@S on  28 so that's 6 or 7 to England, depending on the overtricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn:  not sure what 4NT means - probably takeout, but even so...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East must have a near maximum pass to X 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: Nicola might kno w what this means   dont|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  she will not like her @h if that is the deciding factor|pg||
nt|dburn:  ...if this is the way to try for slam in hearts, Smith may be put off by the quality of her trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  she may think there is the @sA and 1 @h to lose|pg||
nt|blewah: 4nt and then 5@h must be bigger than a direct 5@h|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, partner should have five clubs for this auction, and in general when partner makes a slam try and you have the ace and king of her main suit, you should bid a slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  because she must have most of the rest|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point and East has nothing wasted in @s|pg||
nt|dburn:  for all that, East made a good decision at the other table|pg||
nt|blewah: while 4@sX could have been down 5! as Georgia said|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the surface 1 down but....|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn:  well done|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|don_kapu: pohhh npw 2@H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this has no play so 3 IMPs for US|pg||
pc|c7|nt|don_kapu: go go Indonesia ..... 3 more boards ...|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Selamat buat Tim Putri Indonesia..Kami Semua Bangga dengan Perjuangan Kalian.!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 now|pg||
nt|mamos: England suporters smile|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|blewah: 2 hearts, Don|pg||
nt|don_kapu: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: East thought 4N showed minors and didnt know what after 5@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|don_kapu: ga usah xx atau aneh2..sdh llos|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: specs are keen on this making. Let's see|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|don_kapu: i see|pg||
nt|mug: declarer would have done better to overtake that and play a diamon|pg||
nt|anton72: good news for england|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 2 down now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|westjava: stop don, enough|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@H chance a good save for EW I think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ianmcc: specs very keen!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|anton72: board 28 indonesia stop in 2 @s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|odysseus69: good idea to switch despite the disappointing outcome|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos: it loks asif this match will remain close and tense into the final stanza |pg||
nt|anton72: bad is ...no Vull :)|pg||
nt|anton72: 6 or 7 imps back|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: that club not needed but no harm|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|don_kapu: take K and must play @D K to make 21s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|odysseus69: not such a good idea to continue|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: cashing the clubs would have inconvenienced declarer|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn:  maybe even beyond - the official score is Indonesia 132 - England 155.5, but there may be an appeal against a Director's ruling|pg||
mc|11|nt|odysseus69: what else but ace of diamonds?|pg||

nt|mug: your Uncle Nando must be on the edge of his seat now, Don|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry about early comment, big pickup|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|don_kapu: P - 1@H - North (??)|pg||
mb|r|nt|blewah: 2@s 3 controls|pg||
mb|2D|nt|don_kapu: but i think USA2 have a 16 imps of CO|pg||
nt|westjava: where will they land on this board, don?|pg||
nt|dburn:  1NT, I should imagine, but if East bids 2@h South will double|pg||
nt|don_kapu: yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have 31 HCP but no fit|pg||
nt|blewah: he is taking his medication now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: i'm confident! no game|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|westjava: included this score, don|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: carry-over is already included in the score|pg||
nt|dburn:  they have enough of a spade fit that if they could redouble to play, the result would be more than adequate|pg||
nt|mamos: NS need to stop safely here  -- no big fit so should ..... be ok|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@c = almost a game force|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|westjava: ty Ruud|pg||
nt|alunand14: no, Don.......This score includes CO|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ohhh ty for the explanation|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks Ruud.....|pg||
nt|blewah: 11 controls, can they stop below slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  moreover, that double should enable declarer to take three spade tricks, whereas without it she would not have done|pg||
nt|ahalim: he is not sitting anymore|pg||
nt|don_kapu: why u say that Tom|pg||
nt|mug: through excitement|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that's a clever bid by nicola!|pg||
nt|blewah: what is 2@c, David?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn:  South trying for a 4-4 spade fit - I guess there might be a game, but 2@d is a good fallback position|pg||
nt|yo_yo: must be puppet stayman|pg||
nt|dburn:  2@c is Stayman|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Q or 10|pg||
nt|dburn:  North is not expected to show hearts on this auction|pg||
nt|mug: another fiddly partial|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: this looks like normal but failing contract|pg||
nt|don_kapu: just a normal emotion like a song of John Lennon, Emotion|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos: oops|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|alnanda: no double no trouble...|pg||
nt|dgame: @d lead?|pg||
nt|westjava: no reason to dbl, Arief|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: West asking lots of questions before leading|pg||
nt|alunand14: and........|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  miracle @h position gives this play|pg||
nt|ahalim: state-of-the-match bidding I think|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe Dhondy's approach in CR is the solution to this hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|westjava: normal lead, but a happy lead to decl|pg||
nt|mamos: well  it is not impossible|pg||
nt|blewah: unorthodox 2NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, North was probably worth only 4NT, but 6NT is understandable - there should be around 32-33 highs|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but this hand can be make by sq E in @S and @D|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: one agresive biding from Lusye ,that's her style|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play a 20-22 2NT opening; North was perhaps expecting her partner to be better than that|pg||
nt|mamos: East will have some troubleome discards|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nkgupt: one of the rare hands where 4th from longest is the best lead:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lontoh 63: sometimes do not like it |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|dgame: could gain 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks in OR  looks a lot |pg||
nt|blewah: with 20-21 2nt, they have only 30-31 in total|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed, but South didn't open 2NT - she opened 2@c|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|don_kapu: imposible to get 9 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: now set up @C|pg||
nt|alnanda: if there is no recording errors, we can congratulate to Indonesia Ladies Team..,  we should be proud of their struggles|pg||
nt|westjava: freak distribution of @C|pg||
nt|dgame: nice chance|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure why declarer put up the queen - East not all that likely to lead a spade from the king when partner had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|mug: looks like declarer can mange three hearts, @DA and three trumps|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|nkgupt: all this may not help def as dec will be able to count his hcps|pg||
nt|nkgupt: was a great lead if W had not opened the bidding|pg||
nt|don_kapu: this nidding look like the Beatles song, Yellow Submarine|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|josj: and the Dutch women as well :)|pg||
nt|dgame: does'nt really mater|pg||
nt|don_kapu: dint u see the 8@C stop @C running westjaca|pg||
nt|westjava: yes sir|pg||
nt|blewah: right. that's why i suggested S to open 2NT as Dhondy did|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: this isnt down yet by any means|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|dburn:  certainly not|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: large fish for England|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now we wait for a smile, Indonesia supporters or England Suppporters and i will smile to both :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is makeable, E is caught in a 3-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West may need to convince declarer that she has the @dQ|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, not three suits - there isn't a heart threat as such|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|westjava: bravo Om Jos!:)|pg||
nt|josj: ? I did not play...:)|pg||
nt|alunand14: :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but declarer does not know that|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|westjava: "t" factor, David|pg||
pc|s3|nt|westjava: I know, but you will write all in bulettin:)|pg||
nt|mamos: declare may feel she has to finesse here|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 3 @C discard now|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: oh .. wait one miracle|pg||
nt|mamos: no    ..:)    still on track|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now @H finisse|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: 11 imps|pg||
nt|mug: 1NT by North on  28 on a spade lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn:  still, clubs about to disappear now|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  defenders cannot stop the ruff without losing their second trump trick|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 1@S discard from @D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|westjava: for info, EW play Precision Modified (they call Djarum Precision) system |pg||

nt|lontoh 63: yes ... England started with a 10-IMP carry-over so they have in fact lost 32 IMPs for now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  slight clue for the @cA onside is that South might have led a @c with similar holdings in each minor|pg||
nt|alnanda: how about 1 !|pg||
nt|alnanda: how about 1 @c losser ?|pg||
nt|dgame: interesting|pg||
