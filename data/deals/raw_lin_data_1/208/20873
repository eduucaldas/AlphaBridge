nt|kareno: Good morning Henry :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brgpro: good afternoon from china|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder whether Joel will double 1@h or overcall 1@s?|pg||
nt|kareno: Good morning from Las Vegas, which is never dark :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: too strong to overcall 1@s...so he would probably X|pg||
nt|kareno: That hand just fits my requirement to double - a tiny bit too good to overcall |pg||
nt|brgpro: so would I...|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: gm all|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: Hi all|pg||
nt|brgpro: but would E open 1@h 2nd seat?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hoi kevin|pg||
nt|henryb:  East will open either 1@h or 2@h,I believe|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h I think is @h + minor|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think he would pass...the wayi know Drijver|pg||
nt|brgpro: he doesnt mind opening light but not this suit|pg||
nt|kareno: I find that extreme but we will see.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2@h is never in my consideration, even if it does show 2 suiters hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 55 imps with 32 boards to go|pg||
nt|brolucius: The start of play is always delayed by around 10 minutes in this Open Room, to allow the Closed Room to play a board or two for comparisons. (Also for security reasons). |pg||
nt|kareno: Lots of time to make it up but time can go very fast if the boards are flat.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: looks a big difference but some 5 swings only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another 5 minutes to wait, but it will be worth it!|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 4@SX in CR|pg||
nt|brgpro: other table is in 4@s Xed i am told...that would go -2 to -3 i think assuming @c10 or 9 lead...on @hQ lead might go -1 only|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks like -1 so -100|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: -1 |pg||
nt|brgpro: on @hQ lead yes|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: but how bidding went to come in 4@S?|pg||
nt|kareno: If I doubled and then bid spades, my next bid would be notrumps.  @h nine does look weak for that, however.|pg||
nt|brgpro: but normally it would go X then 2@s over 2@c...that would be passed?|pg||
nt|kareno: Must duck @h queen any contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: lall opened 1@H as E:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: but i would guess pass pass 2NT here and all pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: and N played 4 @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I look forward to the 200-page book that will contain the pre-analysis of this first board.|pg||
nt|brgpro: does anyone know the link to the video site?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: took your shower:)?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011  for live video. Turn sound off if you want to listen to the BBO commentators instead (we hope you do :))|pg||
nt|kareno: Ah, after 1@h doubled, by north I would bid 2@c.  While 1@s is convenient, at least in clubs you have four cards.|pg||
nt|brgpro: thanks |pg||
nt|brgpro: i think it must have been 1@h opening by E and S X then N bid 1@s...then S can not stop below game|pg||
nt|brgpro: i doubt Drijver would open 1@h here|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see the actual bidding by putting your cursor over the Closed Room result, top left.|pg||
nt|brgpro: Grue and Lass are playing prec., that is why they could open the E cards.|pg||
nt|kareno: We will find out in a few minutes if he opens.  I would definitely open that hand.  First in has a little edge.|pg||
nt|brgpro: but EW here playing Nat, hard to open that hand 2nd seat|pg||
nt|brgpro: Lall|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 2nt in S all pass|pg||
nt|brgpro: not my style to open that hand anyway, especially 2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kareno: So now we know :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: change the @h suit to K109...then it is different|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: still very much problems to finesse as declarer here|pg||
nt|brgpro: for the first time my prediction worked...|pg||
nt|kareno: !t a likely lead.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jaapfr vg: good prediction|pg||
nt|kareno: @s rather.  But here is a more passive club lead.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|brgpro: after 2NT and all pass, passive leads are the right leads most of the times|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: The contract of 2NT passed out goes down around 70% of the time. Some say that you should always double in the 4th seat (at match-points, anyway). A famous Indian player followed ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: this learned path and claimed that the contract went down 80% of the time.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|brolucius: That was over his long career. Of course if responder knows you will double, he can pass on an 8-count and then redouble.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: I have been doubled in that contract, that auction, and it was miserable.  With high cards batched in one hand life is hard.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|c6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: still 2nt C likely with @C 4-4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|brgpro: the next 2 @c would squeeze S a bit, he would discard a pair of 6 i think|pg||
nt|kareno: Perhaps he will release the spade.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that would give him a trick short|pg||
nt|mathat: @d to the dammy and @d , @h from hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brgpro: pair of 6 is my guess|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|brolucius: No more commentators, please. We already have 7 or so.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: now @D quess|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes..now a @d is best|pg||
nt|brgpro: for defense...|pg||
nt|brgpro: declarer has to guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: agree kibs DD 4@H looks a piece of cake|pg||
nt|brolucius: The sequence 1@D - 1@S - 1NT - 2@H is non-forcing. East advanced at the other table because he thought his hand was particularly good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: the W hand can't get forced at the beginning, that makes a big difference|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr vg: sure|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: The similar sequence 1@D - 1@S - 2@D - 2@H is normally played as forcing nowadays. One of the reasons is that if you have to jump to 3@H instead, opener does not know if you are ...|pg||

nt|roswolf: a pass from west at green - must be inconvenient for his system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump cue = mixed raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mixed =  shapely hand too good for simple raise, not good enough for invitational raise|pg||
nt|ady: does not seem to good for a simple raise for me|pg||
nt|ady: not clear cut for north to go as far as 4@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D   a hedge   too good for 3@H  not good enough for 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  game try    rejected|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: has no prayer of beating this|pg||
nt|ady: in this case  e/w would have done much better to sac   2 down worst way|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good stop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play 1@D-2@H/@S  = 5@S 4/5@H  weak/inv   so 2@H  is a different hand type|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts played by West  may be awkward on J@C lead   getting forced immediately   may not be able to bring in spades|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: diamond set up for 11 tricks a definate possibility on this lead     spade lead  much more of a problem|pg||

nt|harmon: only chance to beat this is with swindle win 1st dwith ace|pg||

nt|brgpro: but why the J...assuming A1098xx in S and Qx by N...the suit can be blocked...|pg||
nt|kit: Going up jack of spades was quite reasonable -- South could easily have underled AQ, and then going up jack only play which makes.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: kibs he thought @SJ last chance to be in dummy to finesse CK (assuming @SAQ in S)|pg||
nt|brgpro: then he plays S with AQ109x...was the 9 standard lead?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a diamond will follow now.  at least he has an entry for a club finesse   but he is down 2 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: I think they play Rusinow, so 9 would be led from any holding including the 10|pg||
nt|brgpro: AQ98xx would anyone lead the 9?|pg||
nt|brgpro: the 8 looks standard|pg||
nt|kit: So he would lead 9 from AQ109x|pg||
nt|brgpro: so the 9 can't be from AQ98xx|pg||
nt|brgpro: just a matter of what they lead from AQ109x|pg||
nt|007 joosth: S will probably have the @D ace  otherwise he would have lead a heart|pg||
nt|brgpro: if the 9 is from Q98xxx, then playing the J cant be right anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hurd and Wooldridge do lead the 9 from H98, their convention-card says. |pg||
nt|kit: if South has ace of diamonds that would place a spade honor with North, so maybe jack is wrong play on that analysis|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a bare king is the only chance to make the contract however|pg||
nt|brgpro: playing the J is only right when S leads from AQ109xx, but wrong in all other|pg||
nt|kit: But if South has only 5 spades playing low won't work (North won't play ace from Axx), so it only caters to South having Q109xxx.|pg||

nt|roswolf: A TRUE CANAPE OPENING|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-13|pg||
nt|ady: ok   this time they could escape|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  Zagorin in 4@S   2@S-4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@S was mildly conservative, after S's weak raise. 4@S was possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try 5@C which will discourage Bathurst from bidding more|pg||
nt|ady: sorry folks  have connection problems|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is easy, and 5@D looks OK, but if N doubled 3@C (t/o) to try to get to 3NT, S might pass and 3@CX would be cheap save|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: it did and anothe 13 imps to team america as i predicted:)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS  invert the PASS/DBL from the way most Big Clubbers bid over interference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good point from Hedy on Voice Commentary    deWijs upgraded his hand from 1N=good 12-15|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: very controlled auction |pg||

pc|sT|nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  Puppet 2@D   a) to play 2@D  b) some invitation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must admit i wouldn't do that with 4333 and no fillers|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: Have to pick @SQ (unlikely but not impossible) to make 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  Grue also in 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: In 2@D, Joe Grue will not go -4, more like -200, I predict|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: that's part of  2-Way Checkback   aka  2-Way NMF   aka XYZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW obviously discussed this auction   with  2N showing minors|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle: the 3@h bid proved very effective in stopping EW reach their cold game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but XYZ applies in other sequences that don't end in 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember opener only promised 4@C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: 4@S   good contract    case for west to try 4@S    though cant say automatice|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2nt is realy to clubs|pg||
nt|barbyh: relay|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: Other room also in spade partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: West could have played @SJ instead of the third @d, to escape for -200, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue in same end position in 2@D  so -400 probably a push|pg||
nt|petergill: with trumps 4-1, declarer will need absolutely inspired play to make this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller thinks there was a break in tempo |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and asked for a director|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North didn't see it|pg||
nt|petergill: Easy for us with all 52 cards visible, but almost impossible to make 6@D looking at 26 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: before the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinks it was the fastest bid he made in the auction..|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20 was pushed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst leaves to the toilet now|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   alert 10-15 pts   4+ diamonds??|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphznt: North alerted it like that|pg||
nt|ady: may not be good news when he returns|pg||
nt|petergill: We all saw for ourselves how long it took for S's 5@D - though if we were all polled, we would estimate different amounts of seconds - such is the nature of human memory.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: not the dummy I Hoped|pg||
nt|ady: so some sort of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S denied @H control  so Zagorin 5@C not only shows the @C void but ALSO @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Think south decided to show his hand like this..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I couldn't read SW explanation|pg||
nt|petergill: If S did have a 4th @D, then 6@D would be a decent contract. |pg||
nt|rhelle: so, single dummy, how to play this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver start with 1@D [usually 5+]  -  2@C Relay, INV+|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 top tricks. Where to find 3 more, and lose only 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin doesn't know how to play yet, according to his body language|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither do we|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe take the ace, @h to the 9?|pg||
nt|rhelle: aiming to ruff 2 @h in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe he has a chance. Does the 3@C overcall suggest @SQ? More importantly, if East turns up with 4 @D's and 3 @hs when KQ drop and obv only 2 @C's then @SQxxx onside cannot be ...|pg||
nt|petergill: picked up for 4 tricks so the only hope might be Qx doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to think of the hand as if you were at the table and DO NOT know @SQ falling doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was lebensohl or  good/bad???|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla:  great article on 4-5 minors openings: http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  3 Wooldridge in 3@HSouth|pg||
nt|ady: cannot afford the 9@D|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile on 2, the Dutch declarer in OR took 12 tricks in 4@H, making it a 4-ttrick difference -- quite impressive|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle: this switch does not paralyse declarer|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: attempt to ruff 2 hearts  which as it happens wont be neccessary  and bank on spade finesse   4th spade discarded on club|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you ruff 2@h in dummy, you only need the @s finesse|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|vugraphznt: Drijver asked if they do it often bid 1NT with a 4crd Major|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   other room  Grue in 3@CX|pg||
nt|petergill: he plans to ruff two hearts in dummy then try to pick spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or deWijs to hold @HH10?|pg||
nt|ady: would be betterof without 10@S   which gives the losing option|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX should make 6 or 7 or so tricks, one would think|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is also the option of another @h finesse now ... to get rid of the losing @s|pg||
nt|petergill: If de Wijs inserts @H10 on the next @h from dummy, it's tempting to finesse the jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller probably plays @HK @HQ randomly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but perhaps @HK would give Zagorin pause|pg||
nt|rhelle: by now West knows that East has the @h KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that Rob?|pg||
nt|rhelle: so inserting the @h 10 is a doable false card|pg||
nt|rhelle: very unlikely that declarer would finesse the H9 in trick 2, missing only 10 and Q|pg||
nt|petergill: Many lines were possible e.g. if declarer could tell that clubs are 6-2 not 7-1 (at this vul, 7 card clubs might bid 4@C not 3@C), then alt line of ruff club and finesse @S10, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: eventually making on crossruff which needs 1-4 @D, was possible.|pg||
nt|rhelle: if Bauke had the Ace, he'd cash it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime   the other room, which started 10 minutes after us, is already on board 22|pg||
nt|petergill: We learnt yesterday (Wooldridge's 6@S) that predicting the outcome of the play of slams like this one is difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller taking 1 of his famous pauses..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult ... especially of the future|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I heard he is looking for inspiration in those|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller no doubt hesitating between a trump and a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, he's wondering why declarer pitched a spade at Trick 1|pg||
nt|rhelle: a trump to stop 1 ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|rhelle: or a @c to force declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: This long think, if read correctly by an opponent, might clue a Grue-like declarer into thinking that E does not have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it looked like he is about to play a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: with @SQ, E might exit more quickly in @d or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Transnational Quarter Final  with 8 boards to score  Gordon over [heavy favorite] Angelini  by 31|pg||
nt|rhelle: assuming what Muller has based on his pauzes is a very dangerous business, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a @d exit is normal now, as if you have a singleton club. Or perhaps exit with @S3?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wooldridge on track to make 5@HX on  2  via double finesse in @C|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|wstuart: Well, the 4-5 minor opening here has no choice - NS are playing a strong @C so the @D is nebulous.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S    but inlikely to lead club|pg||
nt|wstuart: When N rebids 2@C, he shows longer @C than @D.|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOLID SCORE FOR TEAM AMERICA|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: All the pauses he has done when I've been commentating have been very revealing about the cards he has in his hand, if the oppoent is a Grue, a Hamman or a Meckstroth (i.e. someone ...|pg||
nt|petergill: who can read such things)|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting ... maybe the Dutch coaches should analyse that|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: 11 to USA   hand 2   5@HX   and made   conceeding 300  at this table|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer is wondering whether to play @S to dummy for @h hook, or play @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: has gone for former|pg||
nt|rhelle: that, incidentally, is the power of somebody like Helgemo|pg||
nt|rhelle: he always plays at the same pace - you never knows when he has a problem|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: in senior bowl   USA2 has opened up 31 imp lead over France|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: the act of crossing to dummy makes @H hook likely - reasonable play on the bidding, simply unlucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why not play @H10,  the known card ??|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 8 ... Now West played low-high, techically and even number|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin saying somethin got de Wijs, and looking under the screen, all de wijs does is grin|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: ... it's amazing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin shaking his head|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: looking at Muller, maybe he is a poker player and tries to read EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter -- any comment about @H8 instead of @H10?|pg||
nt|petergill: I've sat EW and followed Bauke Muller around the room EW in pairs tournaments and can guarantee that he does NOT always play at the same slow pace - he takes his time only when he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: thinks he night have a problem. On many rounds, he was finished on time as EW. |pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: On this bidding, West had reason to believe the honours would be over his @SA and @CK and @DA - and right he was - but East had just enough for 4@s to be making|pg||
nt|petergill: @H8 could be from K108x. |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: hand 2   4@H played by east     much better|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: this going  well down|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: @H10 might have worked better|pg||
nt|rhelle: well played!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 9 was already gone  so 10 known  [and 10 8 equal]|pg||
nt|petergill: Daniel Zagorin doing well, reading the play well, still has a chance|pg||

nt|xenya: yes i know it was declared by W there -- whay i meant is the difference LOOKS impressive |pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: He can count the spades as 4-2 due to E having 4 @s and 3 @H and 2 @C and thus 4 @s|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|h6|pg||

nt|brolucius: is natural on the first round, playing 2@D as Michaels (or similar). With long diamonds, you pass initially and then enter, as the Dutch North player did.|pg||

mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|jaapfr vg: 3@D now|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|jaapfr vg: 4@C and 3@D should both be down|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H was a transfer (a popular method nowadays). West would honor the transfer only with three spades. His 1NT denies  three spades.|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be a push :)|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|kit: And he knows that South almost can't have a singleton club|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: now 12% chance he makes 4@C (only if @CK sec with S and N J96)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Both sides bid one level higher than the 'Total Trumps' rule would suggest. When you have a combined trump length of nine, you are recommended to compete to the nine-trick (three-) ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: level, almost regardless of your high-card points.|pg||
nt|kit: So he may get to dummy and lead queen of clubs, hoping South won't cover from Kx.|pg||
nt|kit: And South might not cover with that -- North could have stiff ace for all South knows.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I think the Law is some more: its the Law of TOTAL trumps.  so add up the number of diamonds and clubs.   also then 4C is to much|pg||

nt|bobholl: but bas doesn't know the total isn't 18 could 20 also :) 10+10|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs made a clear sign of relief|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  Wooldridge in 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Verhees to bathroom............|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fore EW   1N=14-16 1st/2nd/3rd not vul   15-17 3rd vul/4th|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: back..|pg||
nt|ady: USA need to avoid getting too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: kibs suggesting 3NT   might make       but would make     possible on the lay|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm sure - after the 6@s disaster yesterday, he doesn't want his opps to keep making close slams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver play  3@D-3@S as non-force   not a common treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i typed  before seening   3@C-3@D   so  obviously 2N was for some 1-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|rhelle: North may well pass this, with a doubleton @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good point --- probably only at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|petergill: USA2 might be trailing, but like Nickell in past Bermuda Bowl Finals USA2 has the opportunity to play their top four on the last few segments of the Final, whereas Netherlands does ...|pg||
nt|petergill: not seem to have a top four, has 3 top pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  [3rd vul & always 4th]    Grue doesn't upgrade|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|petergill: East's Pass of 3@S was very normal indeed|pg||
nt|wstuart: The Americans are not playing well, but they keep winning IMPs.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Grue answered only with like 8 HCP when he doesnt bid game after example 1@H-1@S-3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great steal from Bathurst|pg||
nt|rhelle: that preempt worked very well|pg||
nt|ady: good one for USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3@S  absolutel limit|pg||
nt|ady: spades awkward for defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5@S invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 19   4@S made  7 more to USA2|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: that opens up  1N-2@H//2@S-2N as artificial to show 2 suiters [and other things]|pg||
nt|ady: with 5 spades and 4 hearts  and no game ambition would just transfer?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: yes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: 12 -14 nt doubtful|pg||
nt|ady: but defence should still prfevail even with jack going up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th best lead    Smith at trick 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smith helps reveal declarer's falsecard|pg||
nt|barbyh: has not a prayer of making|pg||
nt|ady: always difficult not to play jack in that position    lead  could be from KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when not needed to win or show count in declarer's suit --  standard Smith   Hi says  I like the opening lead   Lo says  I don't like the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs play Reverse Smith  [think upside down attitude]|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1NT is very aggressive with the North hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@D opening at this suitable vulnerability on 8 card suit seems normal to me, but |pg||
nt|ady: this hopeless|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1@d would have been a reasonable alternative|pg||
nt|roswolf: west took a cautious view of his hand - quite rightly at these colors|pg||
nt|ady: looks ligh making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rhelle: and to add to the insult, he finesses the @c :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not until you see location of @SQ|pg||
nt|ady: to be fair if the spades came in then would make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: system wise,  not sure|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3rd and 4th hand, the restrictions are lifted, as there are no more relays|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 12-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spot leads  3rd/low|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rhelle: a GOOD 12 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: right,  sorry,  said 14 |pg||
nt|petergill: vul in 4th seat 1NT would be 14-15, not vul 12-15|pg||
nt|petergill: NS System Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: It looks like the @d ruff will hold them to 9 tricks, if West rises on the first heart - he may not|pg||
nt|rhelle: at first glance declarer looks to have 10 tricks. However, after the @d lead, he can choose to lose an extra trump or suffer a @d ruff|pg||
nt|rhelle: so I predict this contract will just scrpe in|pg||
nt|rhelle: *scrape*|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|petergill: West is thinking BOTH - do I play partner for a singleton @D - and - do I rise when a @H is led from dummy later?|pg||
nt|ady: just down 1 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that means  3rd from even   of cards   low from odd    [3,5,7]|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: easier to duck @SJ  playing 3rd/5th leads|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1:  4 Hurd 3N north|pg||
nt|ady: north straight in   to clear openers suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA @S3 to show @C entry|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: think he finessed on the speed of Wests lead|pg||
nt|ady: so 11 back to USA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: in college we decided since all invitational bids were accepted we'd change system to make them SLAM tries|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: in 2nd seat, there's 50% chance that partner (not your LHO) has the best hand, in which case 4@D might bypass a good 3NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: i guess it doesn't matter|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: for those who know the Rule of 11   there actually are analogous rules for other leads|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: hence West's very smooth low play on the 1st @H - it was the only chance to beat 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: not the best    but still should be down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rule of 15 tells you which rule to apply     example  if 3rd  15-3 = Rule of 12|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s8|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: in college  we had a lot of minus scores|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: tryung for 4 heart tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this way vP didn't need to make a discard|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|nt|ady: hand 3  5 toNetherlands where USA pushed to 3NT with 23|pg||
nt|ady: but to no avail|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another sidebar   many top pairs have started playing  over 'nebulous' @D   that  2@D=natural  and 2@H/3@C = michaels  weak/strong|pg||

nt|brolucius: You can see from the live video-feed how quickly the players sometimes play their cards. Murder for our VG-operator to enter them all when that happens. Heaven knows how they do it ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: so well, and for so many hours.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|jaapfr vg: 3nt logical here but needs a @C lead to make|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT in closed room down 1 on heart lead -- but it looks to me like holding up twice would lead to a make.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well also some chances for 3NT in W  with spade lead|pg||
nt|kit: Unless South finds spade shift.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: agree David: hope we give a big clap-clap-clap for all operators whilst they were very good |pg||
nt|kit: And realistically there is no way South would find spade shift when his queen of hearts holds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You see that East applies the Total Trumps rule. He expects at least five diamonds in his partner's hand and so jumps to the three-level.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: heart lead will be ducked  but then the spades will come...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2!N=6-10 HCP, 5+@C & 5+@D, should be reasonable texture|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C?      upgraded for playing strength   16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: De Wijs claimed on squeeze|pg||
nt|xenya: seems W ractified the count for declarer for the squeeze when he cashed @HK -- interesting hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 3@H=preempt|pg||
mb|r|nt|petergill: W doesn't care about the overtrick - he hoped declarer with @HK10xx slotted the ten on the first @H, playing for @HA offside because W might play @HA if he had it|pg||
nt|ady: systemic to show shapely with minors |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: north's hand just keeps getting worse|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 20  deWijs also won the @CA immediately|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|roswolf: bd3 in other room 5@CX|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 22: "pip power" = West played @S7 early in play. playing UDCA. Consistent with 79 or 7Q, or else falsecard (unlikely?). Then East played @S9 on spade to king-ten at end - was ...|pg||
nt|petergill: this too revealing?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 21 I mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of the USA2 pairs are hyperactive opening bidders|pg||
nt|rhelle: Good point Peter - 7-4 is not consistent with high-low even|pg||
nt|ady: even 2NT  down on best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller shows no preference and now will show a decent hand    i think|pg||
nt|ady: game force with 8 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other table will start  1@H-3@H  so same problem there for East|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: many of heard the story before,  n/s system call tarzan club |pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Lall was surprised by the @HQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: how the e/w cards are very handily placed perhaps even for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if @C2 was suit pref   then  @DA seems automatic|pg||
nt|ady: assuming 17+ with west?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on voice   Ben describes upgrade as hand he would bid playing natural as 1@D opener that would jump rebid 3@D   a nice description|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle: North could relay more with 3@h, but slam is unlikely now|pg||
nt|petergill: An easy 3NT which makes in comfort|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Bert te Velde for pointing out to me that @S9 on the 6@D slam might well ahve been the wrong card to play - this is the sort of fine detail that Joe Grue and Justin Lall ...|pg||
nt|petergill: take advantage of. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 20  declarer again hid @C length   but I still don't see when it could be right to win 1st round of @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal with frequent upgrades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift thru Grue's @SAx  is best -- but is it doable?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: however|pg||

pc|d2|nt|warrens:  looks like a good hand for a @C safety play: K, then low towards A9|pg||

mb|2S|nt|jaapfr vg: 6@D an around 25% slam|pg||

nt|007 joosth: kibs|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H!|nt|jaapfr vg: esp with expected @S lead creates entry problems but lucky W @CK|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D best, but I believe 6@C can come home.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Playing in diamonds, South would like to get three club discards on dummy's hearts, but there are too few entries to dummy.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C now ?|pg||
nt|kit: On this start I don't think the club fit will be located.  It is a question of how many diamonds they bid.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7 cards shouldn't be dummy :)|pg||
nt|kit: I think Wooldridge will bid 4@D, not 4@C|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y  to many difference between the suits|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: to all questions kibs with expected @S lead you have entry problems and so must find @CK |pg||
nt|007 joosth: i think S will stretch a bit here  being so far behind|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @S lead is 20% other leads 40% chance|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not easy for South. I am not surprised he is thinking for so long. His partner might have a singleton diamond. |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|kit: So much for that prediction|pg||
nt|007 joosth: they might reach 6@C now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: spade lead seems automatic|pg||
nt|kit: 6@C treacherous, but I believe it does come home|pg||
nt|brolucius: Normally North would cue-bid his cheapest control, but here 4@H would be ambiguous. Also, he would lose the chance to show the spade control at all.|pg||
nt|kit: now 5NT pick a slam by South?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bobholl: may be will be interted as oldfashioned josephine :) (not serious)|pg||
nt|kit: this is just to play I think -- sure doesn't seem right.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: agree with your 40% 6@D and chance to make 6@C must be around same % but at this stage we must hope they bid it|pg||
nt|kit: Well, now we will see.  Diamond lead actually best for defense, but that won't be found.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Although 4NT was an offer to play, as Kit said, he has already made a slam try with his 4@C. So North is happy to bid 6@C on his cards. |pg||
nt|007 joosth: W will play spades as many times as possible|pg||
nt|kit: Club to ace and club to 10 percentage, as it can win with clubs 4-1 as well as West having Jxx.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Ben was spot on in Voice Commentary|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: als nay be a warning to the americans not to mess around too much on the future bds|pg||
nt|roswolf: also may|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lall said they will bid this slam on the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 2+@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP  5+@H  maybe 5@H 5@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: USA  would have to bid an against odds slam to gain on last one|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree but they seem to have the forse with them|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't this will slow down the American's style at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N or stayman?|pg||
nt|ady: only 8 obvious tricks in 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: so Warren's point about the safety play is good - to protect against Q10xx in either hand|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D invitational or better with clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grip & rip 3@S from Lall|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: force|pg||
nt|wstuart: The boys are bidders at both tables.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15, ostensibly 5+@S   but  3rd seat ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D preempt     they also have bid to show weak hand with @D & @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H shows 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: N has the 3@s bid almost at the table -- but stops|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and got a 3nt instead|pg||
nt|ady: dont think this can be made on a heart lead despite specs claims that it can|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  looks a make  |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but it can misfire|pg||

mb|5D|nt|wstuart: All of their matches have been total slugfests, if you will, in the bidding.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT missed here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry 11-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 21 [3@D+1]    Muller overcalled 1@S with 3@D    Bathurst in 4@S North|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And i think he wrote that 3@H was Stayman|pg||
nt|ady: if Q@H played and ducked  then (@C switch |pg||
nt|ahollan1: yeah  calling it Stayman  saying shows 4@S  equivalent|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but I am not sure -- and N does not have a very nice handwriting :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  laydown on a @H lead, but not so easy on a @S lead|pg||
nt|ady: this maif fail  on a spade lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: True - but I predict the @h10|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh well commentators curse in action again |pg||
nt|ady: need to be a good guesser|pg||
nt|warrens:  do N/S play 4th best or attitude leads vs nt?|pg||
nt|petergill: Still very likely to make 3NT on @S lead, by playing towards @HQJx twice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL could have been  Strong NT  [2@H]   so again  delayed @H bid from Verhees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very reasonable choice|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: More on Bd 21: when experts play bridge back home, they often falsecard to try to trick you. But when they represent their country, falsecards early in the play, like West's first ...|pg||
nt|petergill: spade, are much much less common because experts when repping their country feel some need to play "properly", to not be the person who costs the game. Hence trusting that early @S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: pip = good pip power. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW did well to force NS guess|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rhelle: they play better seeing 13 cards that I do with all 52 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is fallout of playing Raptor NT overcall|pg||
nt|ady: now needs switch|pg||
nt|ady: should know  cannot bring in hearts with only 1 outside entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck kills West @H suit  but  @C switch a different grief for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: USA   must  get these situations right from now to have any chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge knows North  2/3@S   and J9xx in dummy dangerous   seems to point to @C shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they see things deeper than I do :(|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: lots of clubs played and discards not fun for n/s |pg||
nt|petergill: attitude leads to NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting; there is a double @d finesse as well that can be taken|pg||
nt|petergill: so W does not know if @s are 4-4 or 5-3 - good point, Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  with attitude leads this is much harder|pg||
nt|ady: well played Wooldridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now declarer needs East to hold @SAK     i think|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: indeed - they certainly turn over the imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bas looks like, come on Sjoert... |pg||
nt|ady: does need either KQ clubs onside   or doubleton honor   as defence do have 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I feel  3@H better that double by south|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: kept them out of a slam that needs some luck on a spade lead  cutting of the 3rd heart trick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: 6 to play in transnational QuarterFinal   Gordon 72  Angelina 34   both teams have former world champs, but Angelini  Fantunes & Meckwell|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: there are lay outs where the defence have 4 spade trricks   but no this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 4 usa in 5! @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they started teasing SJoert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had good results playing Raptor NT overcall  but felt uncomfortable in hands like this felt uncomfortable with normal DBL sequences|pg||
nt|ady: still ok    |pg||
nt|chick:  http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Raptor.html|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: Yes indeed|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|barbyh: they wont have any trouble defending this|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, EW play attitude against NT, so declarer has no clue about North's @s length|pg||
nt|warrens:  now declarer hopes to learn something from the discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N can pitch 2 @h's and then one more card (=?) if clubs are run|pg||
nt|warrens:  one reasonable line is a @d to the 9, then try a @D to the Q the next time|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play diamond finesse   for contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is that immediate @H bids from Verhees say  just 1 place to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where delayed auction says 2 places  and that is why vanProoijen pulled|pg||
nt|ady: may just cost a couple of imps playing clubs rather than hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW auction is consistent regardless of who holds @CQ|pg||
nt|ady: I am assumming tot losing a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but gave them a shot at 4@SX     but point is  they forced NS to make the last guess|pg||

nt|brolucius: Well done. I realised that my previous commendation of the Dutch slam bidding would prove the kiss of death for them. |pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: after club-lead you will have to play for the spade jack in N i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 4 losers (only defense can reduce these to 3 losers)|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead even a finesse of the @S J wont help|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: if declarer plays spade to 10 he has a good chance|pg||
nt|kit: but diamond lead is normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table, North played the !Q on first trick. Declarer did subsequently finesse @S10.|pg||
nt|brolucius: @DQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: In closed room North made good play of queen of diamonds, retaining entry to partner's hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|henryb:  and preventing an early entry to dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer can make by playing North for jack of spades rather than South for ace of clubs, and on the bidding perhaps he should.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @DQ trick 1= beauty Queen|pg||
nt|brolucius: South switched to a club when in with the @SA and North allowed dummy's honor to win.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|007 joosth: + the fact there was no spade-lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: There was no quick entry for the spade discard. (Spades were blocked and declarer's remaining trumps were @HQ-J)|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think much inference can be drawn from lead -- South simply has a solid sequence to lead from.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A fine defence from the Dutch North-South, that will probably make the last bulletin. Excellent.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|zlatan: ta epaize to allo xeri xasane kai mia mpaza kai egine afto|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer can make via king of diamonds, diamond ruff, spade to 10.  But should he do this?  Not clear.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: elimination of the diamonds now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @DK x@D and @S to QT very atractive now|pg||
nt|kit: South could have ace of clubs just as easily as ace of spades.  Or South could have jack-doubleton of clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: switch the @C A and @S A and a finesse for the J of @S isn't fine at all :)|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: was about last hand :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone either bid or implied @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: tough hand to play. If South has the @hK, North must have everything else - and then it's hard to make|pg||
nt|petergill: Correction - only Oz Open (q/f finished) and Parimatch (one board to go, 60+ imps ahead) have won the Transnat quarters - the other two matches have 4 or 5 boards to go|pg||
nt|ady: will certainly make if taking the right view now|pg||
nt|rhelle: So I think that he will finesse @h - easier than to rely on than lots of other things behaving|pg||
nt|ady: A@D and heart finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that Gordon v Angelini match is on BBO right now --  of the 8 players, 7 have won at least one world champtionship|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H was in case East was looking for slam - alas 4@H has wrongsided the contract slightly for the Dutch|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i suppose if @C feature, might explore @D slam|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d4|nt|ady: 5@S could make    but in some danger    has done well to take the penalty|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|rhelle: Clever @sQ by North - he's hiding the Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dutch pick up another 5 imps on  7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wstuart: It's possible for the Dutch to win 6 on the last board.  4@H -1 will be -50.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who are asking     3@S wouldn't occur to me either|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bbramley: he'd like about 5 entries to his own hand, but he's a little short of that|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sr 10 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will correct in a second|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 25 here on BBO has been scored the same way it is scored (10 imp swing) on the WBF website and thus on the Bridgemate as scored by the players.  |pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: thought he might pitch |pg||
nt|bbramley: the clubs are good, which would let him throw a small card in each red suit, but that would have conceded down 1|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: and Oswald Jacoby for original transfer concept|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even in context of Big Club system   too many losers, not enough winners  for me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bbramley: so instead he's ruffed up, which will fail as well because west's trumps are too good|pg||
nt|sybarra: or too many anyway |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|wstuart: Win 8 I mean - -300 and -50|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bbramley: but even if remaining trumps were 2-2 the fifth club would promote the setting trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: team america reportedly very slow in the other room|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|xenya: good news for EW is that 2@S also goes down -- but it's a small consolation under the circumstances|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|an| |mb|p|mb|3C|nt|jbennet: but those who retreats to 2 spades are a) A minority and b) long term IMP-winners. (And so were those who believed in Alfred wegener at the time)|pg||

nt|wstuart: How can you call them slow?  They have played 6 whole boards in 80 minutes.  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they have 30 min for last 4 boards|pg||

mb|1D|an| |nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+  often weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: should be doable right?|pg||
nt|ady: good spade slam on 11 card fit|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd say, looking at the sequence in the other room, that the result justifies the means :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2-3-6... |pg||
nt|wstuart: OK, they did start 10 minutes later than this table, to be fair.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 12-15|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous bid by S |pg||
nt|ady: east has nice hand  but will not be able to buy tje hand under the 7 level|pg||
nt|ady: easy 3NT   n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe 10 of @H as only entry |pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@s is a bit pessimistic though|pg||
nt|ady: maybe expecting further action  |pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, S led @D4 which worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room 1N was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: big difference which lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time   i would never choose @D lead over @C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director left after last board, directly slow again|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey once did a study of masses of hands which suggested that AJxx, K10xx , Q9xx and J8xx are the leads that turn out worst when faced with choice of 4 card suits to lead ...|pg||
nt|petergill: from to NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=game force relay|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous is the word,  "weak in the knees"  timid etc |pg||
nt|rhelle: Unless Muller is playing a deep game|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts?|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is likely an inv+ xfr to @H/|pg||
nt|wstuart: Generally attributed to Jeff Rubens, often called Rubensohl (or transfer Lebensohl by some).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@H  if 2suit, 2nd is LONGER|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: very light opening - in the modern style, or a very old-fashioned style, if you will - his hand qualifies easily by losing trick count, if not by honor count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you give up a trick after lead from Jxxx it usually doesn't come back   but  giving trick away after lead from K often does come back|pg||
nt|ady: cash out for down 1 on club lead|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bbramley: this is a poor setup for the N/S methods - north has been preempted into showing his second suit at a high level|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he wants to get doubled in 6 spades |pg||
nt|rhelle: no XX?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i didn't know KTxx was on the list|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst writing a lot, Zagorin just sitting not alerting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: semi alerts 2@C now|pg||
nt|ady: agressive move by north|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = penalty, shows max passed hand, acc to their System Card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14 bal or  1@S444|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry  our room wasn't doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: stripe tail ape...preventing 6 sp bid|pg||
nt|petergill: 1050 to 1430 = 9 imps|pg||
nt|ady: Brink has a pretty useless hand for spades  especially on ace king and another spade opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: South surely has a dead maximum for his 14-16 1NT opening.  Facing the inv+ xfr, he has a clear 4@H bid.|pg||
nt|ady: this will fil   so dutch will dow ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Not here, he is very silent:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D  4@H 5+@D, 0/1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Ben!    |pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphznt: Grue: good luck, this time I mean it...|pg||
nt|ady: fail|pg||
nt|wstuart: It was a 1NT overcall, so he's not at a max.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Still, he has a fine hand with a fit, nice controls and a 5 card suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink has no idea if he is on time.. he asked they have 55 min for those last boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wasn't Symmetric Relay  developed by New Zealand's  Dr Kerr?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: of course, it's usually a poor setup to have a light opener into a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but sometimes pards clubs are more like his spade suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or spade suit is more like the club suit I should say |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - opening on distro is always optimistic, hoping for a fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you probably roll for 6 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he has 3 trumps to lose and the @H ace off the top, and there may be a handling charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps maybe the difficulty |pg||
nt|bbramley: although if he runs some diamonds, west may be tempted to compromise his trump holding (but i doubt he will)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12, 2 @S only went down 1 in other room,  for 3 imps |pg||
nt|bbramley: USA2 nibbling away...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh Roy Kerr|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: and we have a looooooooooooonggg way to go |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C forced 2@D   and 2@S signoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Ker   i never remember   or r's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in New Zealand, he might be better known as award winning Phyicist|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks  unless defence cash quickly when in with K@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to win spade and lay down A@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: maybe double after passing something in their methods|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: Hurd may have tht diamond defensive with west   and only 4@S from Muller    |pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North will reason that EW have a @c fit - and that West will have the @d. So he'll pay a @d to the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: gee they split 1/1 |pg||
nt|petergill: Then 2@C shows usually 4!+ clubs, u run into your lowest suit. Dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|ady: everyone in the action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps to Netherlands for making 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
nt|ady: 5 imps for Netherlands hand 25    5@HX  making|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bbramley: from declarer's perspective, all he needs is 3-3 trumps and a winning guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2@C forced 2@D   2@S = 1-suit invite|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|sybarra: yes give W the East cards and probably home |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the spade cards)  |pg||
nt|bbramley: other room stopped in 2@S and made 140, so this should be 6 imps more for USA2|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: This is fairly normal - I too play it - that you dbl with a max passed hand, taking pressure off partner's need to make marginal pen dbls when u are passed hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for passed hand balancing DBL to be Woolsey   4-major and 5+minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1-suit @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially for pairs that play Mini-Landy in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl backfired as it (unluckily?) pushed EW out of their poor 1NT contract into a better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mini-Landy = Woolsey but with DBL=Penalty|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: hoping to bring in club suit   and lose 1 club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: thats is the end of that|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  Al   you type faster|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: 26 a quiet  2@S East|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle: but what did East double on? Even at my level, this is suspect|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl ---> 1600 to 1430 = 5 imps the other way, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry   Multi-Landy  not Mini|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|petergill: Now that East knows @DA is offside from the opening lead, he can perhaps ruff out the short @DA and make 2@S for a big gain|pg||
nt|ady: swkward communication   but as 10@C comes down in 3   does not matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Transnational   thru 8   Israel over Australia by 41|pg||
nt|ady: now no communication problem when k@D taken |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|bbramley: this room has finally slowed down enough to let the other room get ahead - that will give us comparisons :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|warrens:  on a XX, wouldn't Hurd reconsider?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Senior   France now leads USA2 by 2|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down1   cannot ruff 2 hearts  and avoide a club ruff  if coming back with A@C    |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: diamond best|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: BD3 1@hx-3 team america scored 660 on 3nt+2 so 4 imps to the home team|pg||
nt|roswolf: nd7 i meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd7|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@h ruufs, 4@s, 2@c = 8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1:  10  Drijver in 6@C East|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: Venice Cup   France over Indonesia by 52|pg||
nt|ady: still a good result for Netherlands|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @d10 now is slightly better than @h ruff, but am not sure|pg||
nt|ady: well plenty for USA then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 26 is the hand where  our Dutch pair went for 1100|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, that's right. The spade finesse is doomed.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: as a few others likely are:)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe a throw in  when in 6D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4K = dutch for 4@D  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: K=@C ??   thought  Karot|pg||
nt|bobholl: very simple @C finesse @C ruff @D s and a and a small @H|pg||
nt|fluffy: brink has unattractive leads on every suit, but the least attractive ones are spades (partner didn't redouble 1@s) and hearts, don't think 6@d will stand a chance|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: simple : 3 x AQ when E is bidding is gold but if W bidding far far less)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yes @D led|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder what 5@S would mean now? Natural, strong slam suggestion?|pg||
nt|ady: I am told it was|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its good to have an agreement what the meaning of 4@S is by west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin will open South  -- but even playing Big Club   Verhees may not|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: and another 6 to the dutch on bd 8 - they bid and made 3nt|pg||
nt|wstuart: The dutch would be ahead by 2 now if not for the 18 IMP swing on board 2 where teh Americans bid approx a 2% slam which came in.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=game force relay|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||

nt|ady: 10 tricks in either major for USA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about the private message|pg||
mb|d|nt|rhelle: even so, nasty problem for West. It could be anything, from 4@s to 7@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is tightening nicely -(for us neutrals)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijver taking a postion  for a long thought|pg||
nt|roswolf: that weak2 by south is a hippy bid if ever i saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijer sighs a few times|pg||
nt|ady: will get to 6@S   iam sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: in a sense unlucky his pard is so weak|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like the 2@H preempt there.  He has good intermediates and virtually no def outside.|pg||
nt|ady: I  very much doubt pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: automatic opener for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oops   i don't know what they do after high interference :(|pg||
nt|ady: north fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: can we go back to 1N (about last board) to Muller|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S is reasonable, needs @HA onside or (if played by W) @HA lead - plus @S not 5-1 - and @d not 6-0!|pg||
nt|rhelle: Pass = Forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: denies a penalty X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Rob!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@D|pg||
nt|xenya: slam swing for USA2 on 8|pg||
nt|ady: Lall trying everything to create swings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs DBL probably just "cards"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Nor th wil certainly lead the @cA|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 imps to Netherlands, surely|pg||
nt|ady: that  very ambitius  with void heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: look in movie,  it was club lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps 5@S would be voidwood (void spade, loking for 7@H), so West's choices were 4@S and 6@S - a guess. |pg||
nt|ady: as long as they dont bid 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS confirming that 1N is SemiForce|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  needs to lead @C Ace or a @S|pg||
nt|rhelle: However, North's second card will be problematic. If it's a @d, it's made|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone says @D,  my movie shows club |pg||
nt|petergill: As the card lie, normal(?) defence of @HQ to ace then @DK back defeats 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so expect East  5(332)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: 4@S after long tht or no long tht  west would surely pass|pg||
nt|ady: nice lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: will S try 3 @H?|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
nt|ady: save for n/s in the minors|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: I would win the trump and put N to the test by playing @CK at Trick 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  now, N has to rise on a small @C lead from W, which I think is easy to do looking at dummy's @H's|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry bd 30 a diamond |pg||
nt|ady: mine shows a diamond|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead might beat ..... 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  an excellent spot    only down on heart lead and diamond return|pg||
nt|petergill: but is double dummy, @H lead is very normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but fairly automatic|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: the E hand looks like the ones I have been holding recently |pg||
nt|bbramley: none vul is best for competing - i'm surprised he didn't, altho he already bid twice and his partner was there|pg||
nt|sybarra: enough!! |pg||
nt|ady: yes   club lead   cant get back and forth|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 500|pg||
nt|ady: east has at least some usefull heart pips|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: yes - when i was a hippy at university abd did something silly like this against Boris Schapiro - he called it a hippy bid and said i would learn someday - never forgot that|pg||
nt|wstuart: Well everyone, I have to go play live bridge myself now.  Have fun and we'll see you tomorrow (or late tonight for those of us on the west coast of the US.)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we don't need no stinkin' invites|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds really   not clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how EW differentiate Joel Wooldridge's sequence from immediate Michaels|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle: This is though|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ady: north a bit quiet in this auction|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: tricky   must play ace|pg||
nt|rhelle: very well played!|pg||
nt|ady: abd must resist diamond|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ady: north was awake|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK at Trick 2 could be a singleton king so might be taken, whereas the low club is more certain to draw the unwelcome ace (if @DK was onside)|pg||
nt|rhelle: South played the @c9, an even number|pg||
nt|warrens:  no way he'll play a @D.  W can't have been missing both minor aces|pg||
nt|rhelle: So my money is on another @c, to try and cut communications|pg||
nt|ady: race to 7 tricks    defence can take 4 diamonds and 3 hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DA asks attitude|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs, you really got 6? to Bathurst (but Zagorin didn't hear)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT would be crazy to be in - you can bid only your own 26 cards, not bid the 52 cards. |pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: but of they fail  declarer can take 4 clubs and 3 spades |pg||
pc|d7|nt|bbramley: looks like down a couple, but still a good save vs. the 140 that south could make in hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the OR made 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: W always on lead, to probably gives a trick somewhere |pg||
nt|bbramley: they may have gotten desperate trying to beat 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: to=so |pg||
nt|rhelle: both a @c and a @c are good - even a @h works as West can't get rid of 3 @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Bathurst bid 4@H with singleton Ace?|pg||
nt|petergill: S and W are on same side of screen - N and E on other side of screen|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: this has just propelled e/w to slam - i trust south has flowers in his hair:)|pg||
nt|ady: declaration very soon|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems on the actual layout  all roads lead to -2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but imagine 3 rounds of trump gain in many layouts|pg||
nt|ady: needed to clear the clubs  for 500   |pg||
pc|d6|nt|bbramley: vs. 4@H: possible make even against passive defense if declarer reads the position|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|warrens:  I don't believe it.  what was he playing for?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is costly - and North has to be careful to not let it affect him|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play UDCA|pg||
nt|ady: played well    and then lapsed|pg||
nt|ady: not much further problem   will lose a spade|pg||
nt|ady: much better spades thant hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge now writing some questions to Verhees|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: about leads and discards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphznt: Simon upset...|pg||

nt|roswolf: team orange wearing the sober suits|pg||
nt|petergill: with club void, I think S would play back lowest @d - not @DK - as sui pref|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs was afraid of Singleton A@H in south after this start..|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expected deWijs to continue trump with that holding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: well done - he made it - now that's a good save - so 7 imps and new leader|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure they would have bid a slam  slowly or quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs hand nice --- for cribbage, poker|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: another DBL that could [keyword] include Strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C= any 16+|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rhelle: Yes, of course, sorry ... the 9 is an ODD number|pg||
nt|roswolf: you never know david - momentum of the auction is relevant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
nt|ady: good slam by the Netherlands OR|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid and well played by Sjoert Brink and Bas Drijver at the other table|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: DBL=0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw the inversion of DBL/PASS earlier when PASS alerted 6-8|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rhelle: whereas South had an EVEN number of Clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's imagination is working overtime if he thought about bidding here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@C is something more than 5+@D but couldn't read what was written|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 4+@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this should make |pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: perhaps spades as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  So, South meant the 9 to show a @H card and N took it as an odd number|pg||
nt|drewsky: It all depends on their defensive agreements...if the 9 of @C was count, then south erred. However, many experts us tend to play suit prefernce|pg||
nt|rhelle: fortunately, NS will sit out the next session|pg||
nt|ady: can make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D lead director?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think N played W for AKQJxxxxx void x Kxx, but that seems unlikely on the bidding - but he has to trust his partner's count card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if RDBL=@S  i would think Grue DBL=3@S|pg||
nt|ady: what is 3@H  game try   or barrage after east re-doubled?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will very likely get overboard   after action on south hand|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: lol|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: South has some extras not shown by 3NT - North might pass. |pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands extending the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS open very light, so Zagorin doesn't think he has enough to bid over 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: beats me     i think they're groping after somebody on wrong page with either RDBL or DBL|pg||
nt|ady: already too high with diamond ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   EW auction again putting maximum pressure on opp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dutch stop in 3@S on 27  [4@S-1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs DBL = takeout|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: 3@D  making    4@C  down 1    -50   ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 9 the expected 10 imps when the dutch made 3nt|pg||
nt|rodal f: B27 some IMPs for The Dutch. 3@SW at OR.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bbramley: @C9 is a handy card here|pg||
nt|ady: diamond could never be right   unless his partner had the ace    which seems impossible|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  9  4@H made in other room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: surprised Grue didn't falsecard|pg||
nt|ady: virtually no play on the lay|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bbramley: he'll get at least 4 spades and 1 of each, probably an extra club when west tries to cash them|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree, Peter, it had to be something like that, but that means playing W for a pretty crazy bid non-vul|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Was privat|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   should be down 1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: but maybe so many spots out that still @D6 likely doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tommorow vugraph will be last 2 sessions of our match  and  [i think] 2 sessions of Transnational finals|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: both matches will play same boards|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe an imp for n/s  |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: no  not falsecard with 9  -- i was thinking 5 or 4   |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: trying to get shortened    but singleton diamond in South hand stops that line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs 3@S on 27   south gets writeup if he switches to @Dx from @DAx   that beats 3@S for a tie if declarer misguesses|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: maybe Bathurst should bid 3@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: literally no play too|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|petergill: about that slam: Playing UDCA, S should have played @C3 to show four cards in clubs - when he did not, N went wrong. |pg||

nt|kareno: Here, too, with four good trumps, passing seems a good option.|pg||

nt|petergill: Then @DQ - king ..... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: many specs also pointing out @D ruffing finesse to ditch 3rd @C|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like more imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more sets in Senior Bowl and Venice Cup    Bermuda Bowl plays 2 more today and 2 sets tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinking about @H2|pg||
nt|ady: might do it by ruffing out K@D  and coming back with a heart and discarding a club in east hand|pg||
nt|petergill: if North ducks @DQ in normal tempo (unlikely, normal is to cover in case S has the jack), then |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice that EW don't play 'system on' either|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: great analyst  says  "thus, ACE and a club may get declarer to misguess who has the doubleton"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Australia Open  vs   Israel Juniors   both young teams   [except for one OZ pair]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of tables in Transnational only on 11   the other finishing 14  so still a lot of vugraph to watch after we're done here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And some youngsters playing there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller is the only player in the final to have a previous World Championship|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think the youngest from Australia is 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil  Edgtton  19 or maybe just turned 20|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: curious that in a Transnational   that both teams in finals are  mono-country  [i know  not a real work]|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know age of Israel Juniors|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: Netherlands have made a nice recovery   |pg||
nt|roswolf: what happened there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Grue smoothly ducked @CA...|pg||
nt|ady: slip up    but should still be -1   if no other mistake|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: this looks flat  so of for some lunch     thx    all    bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can/should make shouldnt it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "@CA, @C, @D ruffout, @HA, @D for a pitch, @S to jack DUCKED..."|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: i should say  OPEN World Championship|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bbramley: so this should be 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a likely push |pg||
nt|bbramley: thx everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: see you all in about 1 hour |pg||
nt|bbramley: i'm told other room is in 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 3 nt at the other table |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i wish i could see stuff like that |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: for the kibs who does think this score indicates a win by the Dutch pls do not forget we only played half of the match (64 out of 128)|pg||
nt|ady: another swing for Netherlands   a cvery fgood set|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: this almost certainly a push|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: thx all   bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: room stays open until the open room has finished...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 4 boards to go in open room..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ohhh NZ hebben nog 2 zwarte Azen...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: open room ready, this table is clsosing... back in 30 minutes....|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|petergill: @DA play at Trick 1 suggested N had @DK, so club switch would not have beaten this, I think|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, Al,that's not true. Its just that the 9 won by the US were all Junior WC|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 22, 25 and..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lots of Junior World championships|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: straight in what a beauty|pg||
nt|ady: cash diamond and J@C|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: More on Bd 30 (due to many spec comments): If you do not trust partner above all else, then the mistakes are your own, not partner's. Chaos lies down that track, in bridge and in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: life. Enough on that topic.  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|rhelle: totally agree, Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: getting a count to see which 41 @S break to protect against|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: no  end played later    J@S     from hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx all, cu in 55 min|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they were just in time|pg||
nt|petergill: and don't forget that USA2 has a sponsor who will play less in the 2nd half |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: some risk to that   and cost a trick|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: bad error  by North|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: always happens   @D end up breaking   and @S a nobrainer|pg||
nt|ady: not 3 hearts and a club   9 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: see you tomorrow :)|pg||
