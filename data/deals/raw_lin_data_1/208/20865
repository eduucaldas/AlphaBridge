nt|vugraphzpe: hi Yuval|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|yuval10: Israel are likely to bid game here, 2NT from W is invitational, and E has a maximum and will bid 3NT probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: was just about to say that it's weird that S didn't X....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: sorry the tray passed too fast|pg||
nt|yuval10: are we sure about the initial score , operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: this is what i was given|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: 45-32|pg||
nt|migry: yes |pg||
nt|migry: 8 IMPS carry over were added to teh score|pg||
nt|yuval10: they said something about 7 imps penalty for slow play in the CR...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: but i am not sure with appeal for time going on ...i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: director was speaking with Birman about it...|pg||
nt|yuval10: so the score here is been disputed, we'll take this in mind|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: and he was saying something about time penalties|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: there was also a carry-over that was added to the Israeli side, of 8 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: Birman said that if there is a time penalty they will appeal|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|yuval10: the 8 imps carry-over are due to the direct match between those teams from the early round, in which the juniors won|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like if N doesn't overtake there's a chance of making|pg||

nt|kfay: Schwartz's last chance would have been to underlead @cAc but Sontag wasn't going to go wrong on that anyway on account of the double, most likely, so he actually would have wound ...|pg||
nt|kfay: up with an overtrick.|pg||
nt|kfay: So maybe it's best he didn't try it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the difference before this segment should have been 6 imps in favor of Israel|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Or maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe he didn't have enough trump left.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mrt2000: wonder if they'll get to 6@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: lets see how they instate slam platform|pg||
nt|yuval10: E discarded 6@d and 4@d over the first 2 @c's, i'd say he showed interest in @s|pg||
nt|migry: usually 5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: i assume they have the methods|pg||
nt|ritong: possible, yes:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: knowing these two, it's more or less a certainty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: So team Gordon is 10 in front by now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzpf: not the 3 imps that are displayed|pg||
nt|kfay: I know that N/S play a really 'natural' system, but I'm still surprised they don't have a variety of 2-suited bids available over the strong club opening.  They probably play 1NT = ...|pg||
nt|kfay: minors and X = majors and call that good enough.  |pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrt2000: oh yes  :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|migry: the question is how good the slam really is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@D = @s raise - slam invitational|pg||
nt|mrt2000: unless they get to &, that is|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@h asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 4@c = @d shortness|pg||
nt|migry: with the spades 4-1 declarer has some work to do here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 'mildly invitational with not good spades' is now wat R'berg says loudly|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrt2000: still a make though, I think|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mrt2000: although a @S lead from N would be tricky|pg||
nt|migry: was wondering what would be "normal play" on a @c lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|migry: sry - on a @h lead|pg||
nt|migry: spade is tricky|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to ruff twice on the same side to come up to 12, at first sight|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h+2@c+1@d implies 6 @s tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|migry: and work on the hearts- probably hearts 3-3 will make it easy|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzpf: 5@h asks for Kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@s says -- Sorry partner - I have none|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|migry: 5@d would have asked for the Q@S|pg||
nt|migry: and the second step confirms all key cards|pg||
nt|mrt2000: he found it|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to lose the lead in @hs no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a second round of trumps would be clumsy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he certainly plans to lead a @h towards QJ asap  the question is, does the timing demand a ruff before that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sorry -- says Rodwell -- and put his cards on the table |pg||
nt|migry: easiest would be to try and ruff 2 clubs in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  achesslike hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: an other solution can be @h hook then Xruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N's 7@S could grow up quickly here|pg||
nt|migry: can't make it now as he will have to give a @h and that little @s7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrt2000: strange play from dummy at trick 1|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but i would think twice before questioning a rodwell's play:)|pg||
nt|migry: agreed|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it does not consist in second play low|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I wasn't questioning, just onserving  :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: observing|pg||
nt|ritong: i think his play simplified matters with @s9 in north|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|migry: doesn't look like there were communication problems so not sure why the 8@s was relevant at that point|pg||
nt|ritong: in case of Xruff plan|pg||
nt|mrt2000: agrred, ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and for those of you thinking about an operator error -- forget it -- not this time :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|migry: the point is that while the 8@s was the "wrong" play here, I'm sure that Rodwell had a very good idea about why he's playing it|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: scored as passout up to that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Birman advising Willenken to lead his ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: not even a 3@s bid by South in the OR stopped EW from bidding slam, when West found a 4@d bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: so for now board  7 was skipped and they r playing  8|pg||

nt|phil: unsurprisingly partner has 3433 across - on a bad day its 4=3=3=3|pg||

nt|phil: however on a good day, partner has a 5 card suit - but are you really buying the hand? |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4NT of course would be easy, with 4@s 1@h 3@d and 2@c|pg||

nt|yuval10: and here's another grand slam, very interesting boards this set|pg||
mb|2H|nt|phil: some of the new technology looks pretty interesting as a monitor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they ask BBO operators if there, and players normally call director to watch time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|migry: overcall or pass with the south hand?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: any good partnership would get to 4@H after a 1@H opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@C= Game forcing -- maybe only 2@cs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|migry: looks like they are playing board  7 now in the other room so ignore the result|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: they made it through easily after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: all laughing. Willenken says this one is vul, we're ahead in the rubber :-)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzpf: so - Board 7 seems to have been scored as a "draw"|pg||
nt|ritong: ok lets move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's Birman's turn to lead the Ace...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fluffy: or if not passed before, for me 2NT+3@s is forcing|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: stormy weather|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|nt|mrt2000: a simple soul like me would play for @H 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry I meant 5 spades vs 4 spades|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|phil: no strong feelings TBH|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kfay: That's basically how I've played it in the past (4 v. 5 pieces) but since I came up with it on my own I assumed it probably wasn't any good.|pg||
nt|phil: Im not sure you can have all combos of 4 or 5@s, and inv + forcing|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||

nt|ritong: show both majors if possible, then insist on @ss?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: get to 4@S, I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c = @s-suit AND either @h or @c|pg||
nt|migry: either show spade shortness or clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: in fact, I suspect it takes a @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|1N|an|17+ - 19|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c was probably a sort of "Drury", and now W is in with a @h and a minor bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7NT in the OR as well, good match we have so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: hopefully they have the tools to find the 503 heart fit here|pg||
mb|2C!|an|stayman|nt|migry: 4nt now?|pg||

nt|mrt2000: oooops|pg||
nt|ritong: north has not passed yet|pg||
nt|ritong: by large|pg||
nt|migry: what wd u do with north?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why would N remove the X?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: looks like they do|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzpf: looks like berkowitz wrote down> 5crd Major|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W, I'm sure, probably have some discretion as to whether they can call an 8-cout a bad 8 (and bid 1@d) or a good 8 (and bid something else).  This is definitely a bad 8.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if bidding again, I would prefer 4NT from S|pg||
mb|3D|an|min 5crd !H|nt|migry: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = doesn't want @h lead i guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: transfering to berkowitz sounds ugly, but I think its just part of the system|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: they probably just play the same when 1NT is weak|pg||
mb|4D!|an|transfer|mb|d|nt|kfay: I guess they must play something like 3@d=min 5@H, 3@H = max 5@H, 3@s = min 5@S, 3N = max 5@s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: possible misunderstandning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: NS chatting 'you should have two without @SQ|pg||
nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||
nt|migry: for @d and @s|pg||
nt|migry: with the Q@d being a specific king|pg||
nt|yuval10: anyways they got one level too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: be careful with all thos transfers, some ladies ended up in -3400 in the venice cup RR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: EW referring to the dutch ladies, with the 4@Hxx for 3400|pg||
pc|d5|nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
nt|migry: so 5@s doubled looks normal|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, it would push EW t|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have 5@s and a stiff @h -- if thats helps you ---says Rodwell|pg||
nt|mrt2000: to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Rosenberg answars -- that doesnt help me a lot |pg||
nt|phil: pass of 4@d is useful as  - I dont have a diamond control - you play it|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h6|pc|d3|nt|yuval10: 1 down and 10 imps for the juniors|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kfay: 4@d was obviously a transfer and it led to a pretty interesting situation about how to handle the double.  There's a famous hand played by Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss a year ago ...|pg||
nt|kfay: where they had a Texas transfer auction where Brad redoubled, intending it to say 'you play 4M.' Fred passed and I think the final contract was 4@HXX down a lot.|pg||

nt|kfay: I prefer to play that pass says something like, "maybe you should play this one" then responder can redouble himself to say, "no, I'm pretty sure you should play it."|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Berkowitz squeezes someone, |pg||
nt|fluffy: it happens to the best, but doesn't happen to me, so perhaps I should put more emphasis on making partner declarer|pg||

nt|kfay: And redouble would show a hand that's willing to compete if the opponents take a sacrifice.  Presumably a hand that strong wouldn't mind if responder HAS to play 4M.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|kfay: Personally I would have just blasted 4@H with Berkowitz's hand but he has way more experience with the 2@d than I, and I'm sure he had some really good reasons.|pg||
nt|phil: or - transfer the club threat to E and N is guard squeezed - only if declarer would have unblocked the @s8 earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2@d = raise in @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@d = mixed raise in @c|pg||
nt|fluffy: fisher has a double fit!|pg||
nt|phil: of sorts LOL|pg||
nt|kfay: Likely he was looking for a good slam.|pg||
nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: although he might have checked out with 4@h once partner shows a min|pg||
nt|fluffy: passive leads would make 4@h a make, but there are no apssive leads on this hand, and whatever lead but a trump if continued ends up beating 4@h|pg||
nt|kfay: I don't think it's really emphasized enough that this 2@H bid really shows a very nice hand opposite Fisher's pass.  I've seen a lot of 2@Hs thrown out just because opener is 5-4 ...|pg||
nt|kfay: and that is not a good way to play.  You'll get a lot of punishment.  That's why Fisher's thinking here because I'm sure he knows his partner is reliable.|pg||
nt|phil: especially when partner is already prone to respond light|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kfay: This is another good example of how the 4-4 plays better than the 5-3 since a losing @d can be pitched on the long spades.|pg||

nt|ritong: when west doubled 1@c, declarer will have trouble picking them right|pg||
nt|phil: seems he will do well by drawing trump from the wrong side|pg||

nt|kfay: why they had to wait for the QF of the Bermuda Bowl et al. to be over before they started.  If they're going to call this a world championship I just don't think a 32-board ...|pg||
