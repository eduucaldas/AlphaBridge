mb|p|nt|brolucius: Bocchi's 1@C is natural. All 3 Italian pairs play 2-over 1, which means that a two-level response to one of a suit is game-forcing.|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: Lian and Dhi is the natural pair in the Chinese team.  Bocchi also play natural with variable 1NT range|pg||

nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lian and Shi are not playing a strong 1@C system. One of a minor is natural and may be as few as 3 cards.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lechcold: witam na meczu Polska-Bu³garia|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wooldridge bid 1NT (transfer to 2@C) intending to support spades on the next round. That is why transfers are so effective in many situations. They give you two bites at the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: cherry.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wooldridge explaining he is not 100% sure if 1nt shows clubs or could be a raise in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sometimes they differ , depends on 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but hurd explained as @C ,  madala just wants to know the insides|pg||
nt|ady: would double of 3@S be penalty from North  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ins & outs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: madala asking for the director|pg||
nt|brolucius: When 1@C is basically natural but maybe two or three cards, it is usually best for the defenders to treat it as natural in their subsequent bidding.|pg||
nt|barnets: it seems norths double relates to wests 1n bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  1N=transfer to @C's, but since N opened 1@C, this showed a strong 3-card raise.  Hurd's immediate 2@S over the X showed a minimum|pg||
nt|ady: not sure  what south is meant to do?|pg||
nt|barnets: if wests bid showed clubs perhaps norths x also showed clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: That agreement prevents any misunderstandings, such as may have arisen here.|pg||
nt|barnets: hence x of 3@S would also be penalty|pg||
nt|barnets: by north|pg||
nt|ady: that would seem to be a reasonable choice|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not immediately obvious why N/S should call the director. They are probably happy to be defending 3@S.|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 rounds of spades would seem to defeat 3@SX even with 3 club tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: hoi Gerbrand :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: 2@D showed a bal 18-19|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry that we missed this board, it was due to technical problems|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm almost certain no other table will be as shy as this one|pg||
nt|fluffy: pass is more flexible than other partnerships, upmark has too many extras to just bid 3@c so he douebles|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H five cards and 10-22. They do not play a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we sure this didn't go 1N-2@H//2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: the important factor here for south, is that perhaps on some meanings of 1NT he is on forcing now, and on others he isnt|pg||
nt|ady: with spades breaking well there will be no problem|pg||
nt|kit: Bocchi will have to cover, giving declarer the heart discard.|pg||

nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: a fairly normal 3nt to bid - diamond lead would have been nasty|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: they didnt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since N didnt confirm a fit yet, South redoubled just in case EW were in trouble|pg||

nt|ahollan1: for Joe Grue to be aggressive, he usually only needs 13 cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, how true|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need for declarer to risk dummy's @CK, of course.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Some players who "never" let the opps play 2 of a major would balance with 2@s, but that's dangerous as there is no assurance n-s have an 8 card fit.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||

nt|desinka: hello all|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps NS weren't prepared to defend against this 1NT convention|pg||
nt|fluffy: looks like Bocchi though that double of 1NT asked partner not to make any forward moves, but south didn't understand it that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to understand that 5@D. His partner did not have enough to bid 2@D on the first round.|pg||
nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@D mo¿e byæ bez jednej, ale trzeba trafiæ... zabiæ asem kier, odatutowaæ i wpuciæ|pg||

nt|brolucius: Did you not once play in a Bermuda Bowl, Patrick? What year was that?|pg||
nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: so the 4NT might be Turbo, showing odd numbers of key-card, in the meantime cue in H.|pg||
nt|lechcold: Grzegorz hamowa³ jak móg³, ale Krzysztof mia³ za du¿¹ kartê....|pg||
nt|ady: a lot of bidding on this hand|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Hello everyone|pg||
nt|eggy:  Good afternoon|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: hi Steve|pg||
nt|ritong: hello steve  hi all|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so far both teams have I think exceeded their own expectations for the RR|pg||
nt|ritong: hallo gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  US2 are solidly in 3rd place, and Iceland are in 6th with an excellent position to qualify|pg||
nt|jfeld:  South has entry problems to take the correct view in diamonds, but fortunately hearts are 4-4, so he won't get tapped out.|pg||
nt|eggy:  Pretty experienced the Iceland team though|pg||
nt|brolucius: The final, I meant.|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's was 1969 and 1970|pg||
nt|brolucius: Happy memories!|pg||
nt|gracelin: How can you forget it ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The early days of Precision Club.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south plays 6C guess West will lead a trump and eveything is down to the H guess.|pg||
nt|ady: could be a 20 odd imp swing if Italy bid this swing  on making and going down|pg||
nt|ady: bid this slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy lost 3 slam swings last set (all going dow in slams), could this be a 4th one ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has bid clubs first, as it happens, and West wil be on lead against a slam in that suit. The @SQ lead would work very badly.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: N: "Exciting auction on the first hand"|pg||
nt|brolucius: A club lead would have worked well.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: ok tranfers answers on 1@c, |pg||

nt|vugraphznt: east might think the one Ace isn't @cA, for West did not bid 4@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: The general guideline is to lead aggressively against a suit slam, and passively against 6NT. But here both hands are balanced and a passive lead will work well against 6@C.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gracelin: 6D will go down if it's East hold that K10xx in trumps.  |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes some players from the 1991 winning team|pg||
nt|roswolf: low heart would be ideal perhaps!?|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6NT is down even if declarer guess H.  But I thk hey have found the club fut.|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: but a @h now -|pg||

nt|roswolf: brave decision to leave Bocchi in here he had a rough session4|pg||

nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||

nt|ady: cant see the logic of going to 6@D     can be best on a finesse if west has Ace and jack of spades  and asit is here no play at all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: I presume he will discard the losing club on 3-round of H.  But he smply takes the trump finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel has to block the diamonds so he can take another spade finesse, so he will make only 11 tricks.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: we dont understand the bidding, but the finalk contract is perect |pg||

nt|brolucius: Lauria risks a passed-hand double. South shows extra values.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East has bid 2@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5H will be very expensive at this Vul.|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@HX was 1100|pg||
nt|barnets: for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: Madala very agressive   is pass stronger in that position given the quality of the overcall?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Must be|pg||

nt|jcwla:  Poland (EW) CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Poland/Gawrys-Kalita.pdf |pg||
nt|roswolf: looks ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barel had choices here   DBL 2@H  1N would all probably get some votes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but fewest going to 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play 2@S promises a rebid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: 1nt was 13+ to 16|pg||
nt|ady: yes   fallen on their feet|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Bought the auction really cheap |pg||
nt|jfeld:  Note that North chose a Diamond not a club opening, there is a debate among experts which is better|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I like the 1@D opening bid it is much more flexible than 2@C or 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it will be Joe Grue - Justin Lall for USA 2 in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and Jon Baldursson - T. Jonsson for Iceland|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is minimum and signs off.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@c shows   a good @d raise i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: ...and North shows his extra strength with a (take-out) double.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi, Shirley!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: hi Shirley :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: a timid pass i guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: Traian :) |pg||
nt|brolucius: There is a director decision outstanding on the ENgland-Indonesia match (a potential hesitation Blackwood situation). If anyone hears any news on it, please let me know.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  As most of you will have noticed these names do not match the countries playing - I'm sure operator will get to that in a second|pg||
nt|rensph:  seems we're back and good to go. :) Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 down|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby could have bid 2@C stayman -- probably didn't want that doubled.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or big hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but as passed hand ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL probably denied 5+ suit, so 1@S=4|pg||
nt|roswolf: wrong gblack suit|pg||
nt|brgpro: X=extra and with an A and 3@h S has some reason to jump to 4|pg||
nt|brgpro: which he did|pg||
nt|brgpro: will Dubion save in 5@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: but often the opponents will not believe they are given a gift|pg||
nt|psyck:  Live video stream: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|psyck:  (you can mute the audio to hear voice commentary here)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few would bid 1@H, vul against not, on those South cards. |pg||

nt|xenya: 2N looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ga all|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C    very close to making|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|eggy:  current running scores on:http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double just makes it easier in my opinion for opponents since they have two more bids available|pg||
nt|brgpro: he did too...|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: to beat 4@S needs an early @C attack|pg||
nt|brolucius: The game requires good breaks and is borderline. But E/W have taken out insurance. Quite a big premium for that insurance.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Welcome all - BBO has decided that specs getting it too easy with just voice commentary, so you have to suffer written commentary too :)|pg||
nt|ady: lose control here|pg||
nt|hedyg:  for the livestream from the site: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down 2 i suppose|pg||
nt|ady: only 7 obvious tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobra czêciówka|pg||
nt|tax456: ha fatto scopa con 2 moto|pg||
nt|fluffy: passing 2NT was not a success and obviously NS have 8 top tricks to cash|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is a bit unusual to allow 1@H - 2@H to play, but Bocchi was right to pass, as it happens.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S is als down as there is no entry t dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: mind you 4@S is lucky to make|pg||
nt|barnets: it doesnt|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought we all played hesitation blackwood (joke) |pg||
nt|ady: defence leadhearts  or maybe switch   should create 5 tricks|pg||
nt|brgpro: combined 22 count...but hard to beat 3NT...these guys are really sharp|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: I'm surprised Stansby selling out to 3@C with a void.  Seems right to compete with 3@D.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true a natural bid.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  you have to think what is passed out more often - I guess 1@D|pg||
nt|jfeld:  here, it works out as he gets to find out about the diamond fit immediately.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  If they get aggressive and bid a slam, it should make if declarer takes the percentage line in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 |pg||
nt|barnets: make|pg||
nt|barnets: as patrick said|pg||
nt|brgpro: but 4@h is down one...|pg||
nt|brgpro: need to attack @h early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS odd/even discard|pg||
nt|brgpro: not so easy to see...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: When the opponents find a fit and then stop at the two level, the other side know that the points are divided and that they will likely have a fit somewhere.|pg||
nt|ady: and then again at 3 level|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Ian :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: if 3@c constructive stansby must wonder why he's doubled with his 19 hcp|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think it's for minors -- just a reasonably strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H bound to fail as the cards lie, but what else could NS do?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Barel forgot Zack had passed in 1st seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fireworks from the starts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: dubion cannot know east hand   of 7-4  or would surely correct|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West said 6-5 probably|pg||
nt|juror1: mo¿na obejrzeæ naszych w otwartym http://wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm surprised he didn't bid Stayman with that hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: guess they dont play lebensohl :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: their file is big, no doubt somewhere this auction covered, but i dont have time to search|pg||
nt|pelu: cc: 2M -D - P: lebensohl - against weak 2M - but what if 2@H is constructiv?|pg||
nt|ady: J@S best |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: y|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 5@D is a wrong move|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S3 being odd  encourages @S|pg||
nt|brgpro: need to lead a @H i think or a @s to the A then @h back|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes you cannot pickup Q9xx in E|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: unhappy move|pg||
nt|ady: needed to be a heart lead    if declarer wins and played clubs  should get home|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gracelin: declarer needs to guess trump to make this, but I am afraid he will not.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably down one but can in fact pick up the spades|pg||
nt|hlortz: @h shift ought to get south off ay type of endplay|pg||
nt|hlortz: /any|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Right. This exact holding is why playing to the K and finessing is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or he's incredibly pessimistic|pg||
nt|szalay: its a reason to play Mathe-convention|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mathat: @c is 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: So South survived a potential second disaster as a diamond lead would have produced 1100 should west have chanced a x of 3@H|pg||
nt|szalay: X:majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@H   last train|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last train =  still some interest, can't bid beyond game, says nothing about this suit|pg||
nt|brgpro: N wasn't sure if his pass was forcing or not. ( i believe not) so he doubles|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jaapfr: kibs tell me 5@C can be made but I believe it can not be made (always also @S loser)|pg||
nt|ady: think it might be right for Sementa to run when doubled|pg||
nt|lechcold: król pik móg³by daæ niez³y efekt:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: this morning 1st session was China-Netherlands Shi and Li now Shi and Lian? (if I remember correctly)|pg||
nt|athene: surprising to see this misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|ady: may have been better to cash other club winner first|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hoi william|pg||
nt|ady: hi William|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, a very interesting competitive auction.|pg||
nt|gavin:  Kamil will somehow need to limit his club losers to 1, and his trump losers to 0|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am surprised that South has bid 4@H.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gracelin: from the 5H bid and the double, it's likely that north has a singleton trump|pg||
nt|kit: It took a different lead to defeat this -- but E-W should be in 3@H|pg||
nt|dgame: nice switch|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: how can he believe north bids 5H at unfav Vul. with this 5422 hand.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  interesting. I would have thought Hurd would have done more with his 22 count after the inverted raise|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer finesses in spades, seeking a discard for one of his diamond losers.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: preasure is a very wild animal :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: When 3@H is pre-emptive and weak, a lot of players overbid on the opener's cards, with values to spare (perhaps their brains are programmed to the old meaning of 3@H). Unexpected ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: at this rarified level.|pg||
nt|brgpro: don't think they have any more chance to beat this...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: most partnerships, you would think, at this level, would have discussed if system is on after a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i think this is an important match for both teams - fighting for the last qualifying spot|pg||
nt|brgpro: a quick 2 down|pg||
nt|gavin:  it is easy to see how to avoid a trump loser, the clubs is another story|pg||
nt|gavin:  if declarer is sure that the king of clubs is offside with length|pg||
nt|gavin:  (offside meaning, sitting with east, such that the normal play of a club towards the queen wont work)|pg||
nt|gavin:  then the way to avoid a second club loser|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A sketchy game, 2 @S losers, 1 possible @H loser and 2 possible @C losers.|pg||
nt|gavin:  run the 9@C through west ducking to easts T|pg||
nt|gavin:  and then lead the queen to pin the doubleton club honor |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes DD 5@C can be made|pg||
nt|hedyg:  the OR is starting play now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pull 1@C and ruff 4th @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 10 min later than we do, we have theathre here :)|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H best|pg||
nt|hlortz: or perhaps a @D ruff for north?|pg||
nt|ady: likely 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H and back would further damage N's plan to ruff @S.|pg||
nt|xenya: a kibitzer points out that 4@S might make -- possible in some variations, but certainly not on a heart lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  they play inverted by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: s passed|pg||
nt|ady: K@H   not a gret feature for a balaance|pg||
nt|brolucius: When one side has a trump fit and stops at the two-level, you usually know that your side holds around half the points and should have a fit somewhere. Hence the conditions are ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: optimal for protection.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Bocchi maybe cautious at this Vul.|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming no club ruffs - hmm not favorite then:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: The location of the king of spades means that South does well in 3@C, but the same location means that E-W won't make 3@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after all, north only bid 2H in first round.  So maybe declarer will figure it out.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will have to finish this and re start to link with other table so after this hand ill close this|pg||
nt|gracelin: got it|pg||
nt|ady: not best  as J@D will set up the 9    and low diamond will in affent mean north ruffing a loser  and then trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S3 probably because vP didn't want to encourage @C or @H |pg||
pc|cA|nt|hlortz: nah thats setting up a @D i told him wrong lol|pg||
nt|hlortz: whatever, it looks like they were not on same page 3@c prob not dbled & -1  this is going for 500 i think|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: 2Nt here ask for better minor, so N is forced to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: i see. thx|pg||
nt|tax456: bel regalo cinese sta mano|pg||
nt|fabsayc: making now, not sure if it ever could be beat|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the 3 @H bid I am surprise also David |pg||
nt|bobholl: but bas was vulnarable so not broke :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: He had what he said, but that will not stop a 500 penalty.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: -800 looming now|pg||

nt|jaapfr: sorry DD means Double Dummy seeing 52 cards whilst players SD Single Dummy seeing only 26 cards|pg||
nt|ady: seems that many are in 6 on hand 1   and many making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South, Sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS signals  are  standard|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting how the humble 1@S opening has ruined EW's auction|pg||
nt|gavin:  that would work only when west has Tx or Jx of clubs|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|idc: We have Martel-Stansby playing 12-14 NT & 5-card majors, Camps/Villas-Boas 15-17 & 5-card majors|pg||
nt|ady: now 9@D 8th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  or was a max. simple raise with 4333?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since South did not even bid 3@H first time round, the N/S auction did not guarantee that they would make their game. It was a close decision for Duboin to go to 5@D.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rhelle:  hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This room will be shut down shortly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to reconnect to the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: moment of truth. he would love to finesse the SJ but entry is not cnvenient|pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the first time Lian plays for China.  His partner Shi is a veteran and reach semi-final in the 2009 BB|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I'm not sure. |pg||
nt|brgpro: S wll try to give a @s ruff( the @h loser cant go anywhere|pg||
nt|brgpro: -2|pg||
nt|brgpro: must have claimed -2|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they have accepted -100, he is a lucky boy.|pg||
nt|brgpro: surely not|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: -300|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bafieri: undo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't blame 1@S  but not sure if  2@S or 3@H gets more credit for missing game|pg||
nt|sybarra: but maybe was hoping to push then to 5 @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table is starting now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rhelle:  NS had a relay sequence, where North asked South questions about his distribution and strength|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cards are not favourably placed for the contract.|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 2 off now, declarer losing 2 spades, 2 clubs and the @HA|pg||
nt|ady: now west in the club   better to have cashed earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: example   Zack could have bid 3@H|pg||
nt|gavin:  so you would need to be absolutely sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: Versace X stopped that idea |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ty I was informed that there are 2 players named Shi in the Chinese team|pg||
nt|athene: most pairs simply agree system is indeed "on"; i.e. you respond to a 1nt overcall just as though partner had opened 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: that might not be optimal, since it's unlikely you will want to transfer to opener's suit, for example|pg||
nt|athene: but it is definitely simplest|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and this morning was Shi and Hou playing (ty Dennis)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: another Shi I suppose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 17  Hurd 2@H North|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: well he could have floated spade 9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: If East had an entry, the defenders could promote the @H10.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg:  this is going to fall apart any moment now|pg||
nt|ady: heading towards 800|pg||
nt|jaapfr: EW will have more problems to digest this board than the Dutch lunch they just got Gerbrand:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I Don't know what they had for lunch..|pg||
nt|hedyg:  he can make  3 more tricks only|pg||
nt|ady: this looks a bright start for Netherlands   as far as this table is concerned  they would think they did well to stop out of a slam hand 1|pg||
nt|hedyg:  @c ruffed high and claim -3|pg||
nt|famus: Hello everyone, David Henry|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs: why nor take the chance and bid 2Nt - hope for 3@C and if 3@D from S then normal 4 card suit (even 5)|pg||
nt|xenya: just continue diamonds, E pitching spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: confirmed|pg||
nt|ady: 12 to China  1stt hand  where 6@D down 1 in this room|pg||
nt|warrens:  best now is for S to play the Q of @H's, which will help him endplay one of thedefenders|pg||
nt|ady: good start for Italy|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: or maybe i was wrong and a club was needed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bocchi Madala  also stop in 2@S on 17|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: You can see what a good idea it was for North to keep the bidding alive over 2@H (which would have made). You should always be reluctant to let the opponents play at the two-level ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in a fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he's on the wrong track|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  1@D - 2@D wasn't inverted by an unpassed hand |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S passed in first seet -- so 2@d was "just normal" - not inverted minor|pg||
nt|ritong: not that 3@h shows anything else than a half stopper, although 3Nt sounds definitely discouraging|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barel could have bid 4@H over 2@S|pg||

nt|xenya: still i'm sure they would have got there had without the 1@S opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will fleisher try 2@D [weak 2M opener]|pg||
nt|gavin:  so what made him know that the king of lubs was with east|pg||
nt|gavin:  for one thing|pg||
nt|gavin:  east having 3@S and 2@H was more likely to have longer clubs|pg||
nt|gavin:  and the more clubs they have, the more likely one of them is the king|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  East will be tempted to pass this|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a save|pg||
nt|barnets: a low diamond lead V 6@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: both sides play fairly natural systems 5 card majors 15-17nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D is american multi, i am not allowed to say the real name|pg||
nt|hlortz: if this keeps up many IMPs will be scored since -500 figures to be a big swing also  not 17 tho|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: here better not to try slam which fails|pg||
nt|ady: n;s may possibly get overboard here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D    ok, i did NOT see that coming|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use 2@D to show the weak hands with (5)6-card Major|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brolucius: North may respond 4@S  to his partner's one-bid. No, he has preferred 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we are up to speed now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to claim the first 2 |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is two down, assuming the defence attack clubs early enough|pg||
nt|barnets: works quite well|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Joel wasnt excited that although max he has 6 HCP in partners shortness|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2NT is natural in passout - important to discuss with a partner but should be standard|pg||
nt|eggy:  really - it looked like the strength of an inverted minor!|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w can make 3@C here|pg||
nt|gracelin: 12-14 1NT at this Vul.|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get to 5 @C from N side?  and will it make? |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  And now West has a problem. 2@s is non forcing, but he has a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: but nanev, with singleton spade facing a takeout double, might bid on|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX in other room|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Oh, the pressure...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry, hard to see the claims|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect 3@D is some kind of forcing spade raise|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1 Levin in 3@D East|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he did not like the @HK, but if both sides can make something you should not let the vulnerability stop you from competing. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is this weak flannery?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|idc: The Brazilian Federation has player profiles on-line, look at: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/joaopaulocampos.php|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting hand and would require caution to stay at reasonable level.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this Chinese pair not playing Precision, but a natural system|pg||
nt|roswolf: will they find a way to game on such thin values and making 10 tricks would be no sinecure|pg||
nt|brgpro: 10-12|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: a simple 3nt here|pg||
nt|dgame: i think so|pg||
nt|brgpro: hi en hoi|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am a very timid doubler, myself. But few in a world semi-final are in the same category. Certainly not Versace.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hoi Jack |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  He doesn't know about the wasted @h values in his partner's hand, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of auction some play 2NT by the opener as weak-strong. That allows them to show a strong 3@C rebid (by bidding 3@C) or a shapely weaker one (via 2NT).|pg||
nt|ady: can the get a penalty in 1 heart|pg||
nt|ady: e/w heading for 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Movie currently shows -100 only. Duboin is a miracle man.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  but natural response|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|athene: fearing his opponents have a huge fit and more shape than they do have|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this will limp home|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do anyone here have the link for running scores|pg||
nt|ady: yes   6@H can be beaten  |pg||
nt|kit: I don't know the N-S structure here -- I imagine the follow-up will show a strong 5-5|pg||
nt|roswolf: because of the vul west didnt play for pens|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@s invitational with 5@s|pg||
nt|fluffy: south has very good hand althou minimum|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT would be 15+ to 18, so the 2NT rebid is weak.|pg||
nt|roswolf: no the safe low road|pg||
nt|gavin:  someone suggested that it was gut feel that helped kamil get the decision right|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Grue seemed to mouth the words "Forces 3 No". Regretfully I cannot read the written explanations|pg||
nt|sybarra: your "boys" in action again |pg||
nt|brgpro: actually no game makes with perfect defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: or would "we" rather play 4 @H?|pg||
nt|brgpro: but 4@h has more chance for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think 5 @C has a better chance but perfect defense both go down |pg||
nt|brolucius: South not sure which suit to support.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ten-trick game probably the better target.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S not a bad spot for e/w is it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=slam try @H, some shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: at wbf.org|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX is also interesting|pg||
nt|barnets: def need to play a club|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   500 last hand   got the vulnerability wrong|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C-1 OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: sinleton heart gf |pg||
nt|ady: 3@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: singleton|pg||
nt|lokaty: 3@S 1H and 5-4 minors|pg||
nt|ady: indicating what suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: yes 5-4-3-1 convention after 1 NT|pg||
nt|ady: diamond game down|pg||
nt|roswolf: best game probably 3nt |pg||
nt|ady: 3NT also difficult  clubs break   but communications bad|pg||
nt|roswolf: may vwell be bid by west|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  didnt use stayman - I guess he knows 28 HCP and balanced hands... 3NT rates to make|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and 6M doesnt|pg||
nt|barnets: par is 3@H down 1 v 3@C making|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: mb there was no double?|pg||
nt|gavin:  and I think that is very far from the case|pg||
nt|bobholl: Q of @D lead will beat that|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry - misclick here -- claim wasnt the right buttom :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: botton :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: @cQ took first trick|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: then a small @s to the K|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And E is now in |pg||
nt|barnets: to force dummy|pg||
nt|idc: and there is a link there to his partner's profile, thanks to Brazil for the info|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bit weak of Gosney - Edgtton to pass this out|pg||
nt|famus: these US youngsters have improved tremendously--I remember Lall being there in Bejing Olympiad playing for US juniors--come a long way|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I am too far from the little papers to see what they wrote :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@h is 5/6@h, leass than 12 HCP|pg||
nt|psyck:  who bid 3@c operator?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: only one makeable|pg||
nt|xenya: normal contract|pg||
nt|ady: without a club lead 6@D a decent contract   as club may go on long heart|pg||
nt|eggy:  cultured lead that was close to making the bulletin|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: puppet stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This is interesting.  East will lead a high heart and shift to a minor.  But does he shift to the suit where he has the king, or where he doesn't?  That is what declarer will have ...|pg||
nt|kit: to judge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: although with @H 3-3 and IF @H lead ........ 6@D could be made|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D has many interesting chances|pg||
nt|athene: if the trumps come in|pg||
nt|athene: for example, on a club lead, you could win the ace, draw trumps, cash three rounds of spades discarding a club, and exit a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: IF:)|pg||
nt|ady: 3Nt might have gone down on a club lead if south reads the hand wrong|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  could be a singleton Q somewhere|pg||
nt|cuan: lightner ?|pg||
nt|tax456: no penalty|pg||
nt|tax456: io le contro!!|pg||
nt|remo: si sa mai...al pard venisse voglia di difendere...:)|pg||
nt|cuan: versace can think that lauria's double is lightner, and leads clubs.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Results QF: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=QF&qroundno=1&qtournid=885|pg||
nt|xenya: likely to end happily for Israel|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: ok, this is interesting|pg||
nt|antoniz: witaj Grzegorz:)|pg||
nt|kit: Likely headed for 3NT -- the fate of that is not clear.|pg||
nt|athene: forcing the defenders to open up the hearts|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Leading the K also let's partner know to unblock with the Q.|pg||
nt|tax456: quando non c erano i bidding box succedeva anche questo...|pg||
nt|fluffy: he trusts his mind, not his fingers and sets the bidding to the game level|pg||
nt|fluffy: this has 4 obvious losers, however an endplay is makeable against east|pg||
nt|fluffy: forcing him to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|gavin:  i think Kamil when deciding who to play for the king of clubs on the last hand, was analysing all the info he had available and going with what he thought to be the %|pg||
nt|brgpro: same...in 4@h E will lead a @d and W overtakes, sqitches to @sQ, and with 2@s in bag he can give pd a ruff. but in 5@c just overtake then @sQ woulda be enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: A double-fit for both sides.|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 4@H i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when he bids 4nt you might think it is offering two places to play, in which case he should pass 5@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: could be 6 imps if both 2@h and 2s make|pg||
nt|roswolf: settles for the minor game - understandable enough|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This doesnt look like it can make|pg||
nt|ady: I think would need to drop bare A@D to have a chance in 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  no chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: no very much uphill|pg||
nt|fluffy: assuming he doesn't give the contract away with the lead wich was certainly reasonable given that his only safe lead was a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and he does that at trick 1 instead :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW carding  odd/even|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue was only interested in 54 @H|pg||
nt|szalay: I confess don't see why stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with so many points, i thought he might just bid 3N immediately|pg||
nt|szalay: I thought so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gyorgy got there first :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might have been a slam|pg||
nt|szalay: and Jxx opposite a stopper|pg||
nt|gracelin: with their accurate defense, they beat a lot of 2-level contracts that were made at othe table.  That also make them less inclined to bid in boardline cases.|pg||
nt|roswolf: competent bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: Q would have been better|pg||
nt|brolucius: He jumps to 4@H! Made of steel. |pg||
nt|ady: anything above game  in jeopardy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H relay with  LMH responses    3@S=1@C  3N=1@D  4@C=1@S|pg||
nt|brgpro: @dQ109 looks nice and good @h....although he has some wasted @s values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D was natural|pg||
mb|4D|nt|brolucius: N/S are not playing a strong 1@C system. That is probably why North did not want to make a pre-emptive 4@S response - in case his partner was strong and they could make a slam.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W has no quick entry to allow a @s thru.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@S makes easily for me|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and how get @DQT3 out?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes it is a common treatment that you lead your honor above the gap with 4 out of 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 3rd/5th against suit AND nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ady: easy contract   a matter of 9 or 10 I would thing|pg||
nt|brgpro: N would surely X with his holding( even, on a bad day it makes)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: who is operator?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would put my money on making...|pg||
nt|brolucius: West must overtake.|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting that Lauria didnt even enter the bidding with 2 @D |pg||
nt|brgpro: but who knows...W is the famous versace|pg||
nt|brolucius: He knows North is long in hearts and clubs, but it will still be a great defence if he gets it right.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  the problem for East is communication. He can throw @cs on @h KQ, but how to get there?|pg||
nt|brolucius: When dummy has only one card in the suit led, the partner of the opening leader can give a suit preference card to suggest a switch.|pg||
nt|ady: spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be another swing to USA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C-1 looks too many tricks made to me|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes this is a team of [relatively] young stars|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @C2 shows preference for @H     i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mario Lucetti.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that's why @dQ109 looked huge...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: Lian was in a tough situation to guess the trump layout under the bidding.  Italy really earned this swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2s was 5+ spades veery weak|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sementa led a trump in the other room against 4S, which is tougher for declarer.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought max 10 tricks in @C b1|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
nt|famus: @ds wud b the best lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: trump leads are best and so it was|pg||
nt|ady: good lead|pg||
nt|famus: gr8--Grue heard us--prblm for declarer |pg||
nt|ady: bad club split will beat this|pg||
nt|ady: I think down 2|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats my guess -2|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: not possible to see what they write down|pg||
nt|fluffy: who says the strong hand must play the board now? :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is an invite sequence i thik|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no, 3@s was GF|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bravo!|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jack used to live in the Netherlands, probably met N/S  when they were real little kids|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes...and they were calling me uncle jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: 2 clubs 15+ any reverse without 3spades or nat|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  8 easy tricks - 2 0 4 2 and a likely @h.|pg||
nt|idc: Since the defensive entries (@dT & @hA) are split N-S, defence won't be able to get at club winners|pg||
nt|ady: semi psyche by north    no action from south   believed vulnerable opps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Polska-Izrael jutro ponownie z przekazem wideo|pg||
nt|pawel90: czemu po treflu nie jest bez trzech?|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like the defense should be able to establish enough black-suit winners before declarer can set up the diamonds, but they will have to be careful.|pg||
nt|ady: needs to keep to 2 trump losers  so a reasonable game   but not making|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|roswolf: the play is likely to take some time|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately  evening knowing of diamond position still cannot make|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks are available here -- but that's neither here nor there|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  also Q from KQ109x for example|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think ACBL allows odd/even except 1st discard|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3n is  hand to go for coffee|pg||
nt|brolucius: I saw Bocchi interviewed on some internet video and he said that this was one of the strongest Italian teams ever, with three good pairs who were all friends.|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm they wobbled a lot in the last set|pg||
nt|sybarra: and probably still do :) |pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: sometimes when you have a scrambling bid like this you can use it to show a weak bid in the highest-ranking suit|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, declarer doesn't know heart layout, so this could still be tricky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can"t be bid though makes.|pg||
nt|dgame: -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Now club ruff, heart ruff, and eventual diamond finesse will make|pg||
nt|brgpro: need to guess @c for 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North needs to take and shift to a @c - but not sure even that is enough|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a high spade, if 10 or J drops, he may ruff to hand to ruff the 3rd H.  If nothing drops, just pull the other trump|pg||
nt|kit: Nice choice to get to 5@D -- that will probably come home, although not clear.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree.  5 H's, 1@S, 1@C and 4 @D's (ruff one club in dummy, draw trump)|pg||
nt|kit: In principle declarer would have 3 diamond winneers in North, 1 ruff in South, 5 hearts, and two black aces, but club leads by defense could cause problems.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3H by north makes since west can never get in to play spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: game pplayed by north would be interesting on this layout|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fun at table regarding playing s!10|pg||
nt|gracelin: on C2 lead, dummy has to insert CJ to deny West an entry.|pg||
nt|ady: not may be problem for e/w  if north leads clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in other words 5@H over 4@S would be "good" and 4nt - whatever - 5@H is "bad"|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  allows p to contribute the missing honor|pg||
nt|jfeld:  To read about the players you can check out the team profiles here. USA 2: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/usa2|pg||
nt|brgpro: N will lead his sing. @d|pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe|pg||
nt|ady: maybe diamond lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: I wonder what declarer would have done on a diamond shift|pg||
nt|xenya: club now planning to ruff a club and discard a @D on the @H K|pg||
nt|athene: well, obviously, your first job in 6@D is to persuade west not to hold @DQ10x|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Hamza|pg||
nt|brgpro: @cA lead will give away the show|pg||
nt|brgpro: can make 5 trumps 4@d and 1 each|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rhelle:  the @h2 may help - Lavinthal for @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Of course, North also doesn't know that the 2@h opening was so weak in @h|pg||
nt|famus: bad everthing split i think-even trumps|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Iceland: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/iceland|pg||
nt|xenya: EW might have had trouble bidding this hand if left to their own devices |pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2  Levin 4@H East   but easier for them after Ginossar opened 2-suited 2@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Well, that call undid the good work of finding the diamond fit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: west there is a lot of potential tricks in the club suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  3@H here was a transfer to 3NT i believe|pg||
nt|gavin:  this is a very commonly played convention|pg||
nt|gavin:  among world class players|pg||
nt|gavin:  there are quite a lot of hands were you have a stopper but would rather your partner play the hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  suits like Axx or Kxx, are guaranteed stoppers |pg||
nt|gavin:  and if partner holds something like Qx or Qxx|pg||
nt|gavin:  you'd much rather have the 1@H bidder on lead|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  This match has been very close -- before USA 2 won 6 imps on the last board of last segment, it was tied.|pg||
nt|sybarra: were they playing together then>? |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: here we go again :)|pg||
nt|pawel90: o. teraz jest :)|pg||
nt|kit: Since declarer needs to ruff 1 club in dummy, it looks like his only hope is KQ doubleton of diamonds.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think that's an excellent site by the way, thank you for that |pg||
nt|ritong: some play " strong K" these agreements have to be made for every pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the responses i gave you to 3@H must be wrong since Lauria has @D & @H   i'm trying to find out more|pg||
nt|brgpro: now on a @d switch, versace won't finesse but rely on 3-2 trump break i believe|pg||
nt|brgpro: once pd makes a slam try in @h, the W hand doesn't look so back, great trumps and great @d support|pg||
nt|brgpro: bad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 18  Drijver had stopped in 1N    Bocchi balances with 2@S  and Brink reopens with DBL    standby|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphznt: gives a heart and discards all the clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and there were 100% sure 4 tricks for defense............|pg||
nt|dgame: @h time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@SX is final contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rhelle:  good switch|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi Rob and all|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hello|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes but too late I think|pg||
nt|rhelle:  no, just in time|pg||
nt|santyclz: N will think about what to ruff with on the 3rd @c, but it won't matter.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That might ddepend on whether he believed the SP signal that West had chosen to give.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the 3NT board that we watched a moment ago, the bidding and result were the same at the other table. You can check such things by hitting the MOVIE button at the bottom.|pg||
nt|athene: but as he is a passed hand i am not sure there is any need to make that distinction|pg||
nt|ady: likely to go down   will have to play exactly right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most wil be in 4@S here I suppose|pg||
nt|ady: finess the spade   and get J@C right|pg||
nt|ady: running scores link requested please|pg||
nt|fluffy: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi fluff:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: Hey hey|pg||
nt|psyck:  Bulgaria are currently 15th, but any of the top 15 still have a chance to make it to the top 8 quarterfinalists.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  there is also an interview with NS there|pg||
nt|cuan: now, perhaps - 2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i hear stepbridge -300 so correction will follow here I presume (tx kibs)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: will he get his 11 tricks here?|pg||
nt|brgpro: cant squeeze E|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rhelle:  East can only cross with a trump|pg||
nt|ady: east will need to let west win a spade to play a 2nd trump|pg||
nt|ady: should duck this|pg||
nt|famus: Lall gotta underlead his @s for Grue to play another @D|pg||
nt|ady: otherwise down 1|pg||

nt|athene: 1@S, playing transfer responses to 1@C, basically denies a major - might promise diamonds but doesn't always for most pairs|pg||
nt|athene: now the big issue is, what does double mean?|pg||
nt|szalay: does anyone know the reason?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S not 5@S 4+@H unless game force|pg||
nt|gracelin: In fact Italy only won the first set and lost the next three.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S finessed in @hs, losing to the @hQ so 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Plenty of jesting going on at the table|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  these board tend te get in teh way if you let it make early in the match|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is there but south is worried about his singleton spade.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 6@c 1@d  o 5-4 minore sing @S|pg||
nt|ady: anotgher lightish opening|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@d - 2@d seems reasonable|pg||
nt|athene: double is either spades, or takeout of clubs, or takeout of diamonds|pg||
nt|remo: continua la saga del "non c'è enne @H senza enne @S"|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they can make either |pg||
mb|3H|nt|rhelle:  1@s = @h, unbalanced|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine not bidding 3@C on South hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows major-minor, shapely|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: you have to know which|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: or pd pls bid something I have enough=X|pg||
nt|athene: without any special agreements, most people play that double of any artificial bid shows that suit (e.g. doubling stayman)|pg||
nt|ady: double from south showing spades |pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is if north "raises" spades, he will wrongside it|pg||
nt|athene: that may very well be his concern here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: north asking about 1@s, if east can have 4card M|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise 2 or 3@S looks clearcut|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: only if GF with long @d 4M is possible|pg||
nt|ady: the hand belongs to n/s in spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 2@S looks more logic then imo|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 1@C - 1@S playing these methods is a bit like 1@C - 1@D playing Walsh; i.e. you might have a major but only with a really strong hand that is going to bid the major next, ...|pg||
nt|athene: forcing to game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm trying to find out|pg||
nt|brgpro: dummy discards first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unba  18+ bal|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ga all|pg||
nt|brgpro: the N hand has to pass?|pg||
mb|d|nt|rhelle:  1NT = relay|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H     not a great contract   but can make|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4333 quite obviously not interested in stayman of any sort|pg||
nt|ady: why is it wrong sided    must eventually lose 2 diamonds and 2 clubs whoever plays spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and what about PASS?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H is 11+, 4@H just practical with 4-card supp|pg||
nt|eggy:  practical and perhaps optimistic :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we started play about 10 minutes before other table  so they get to see our results|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  3  Israel again opens 2-suited preempt  this time 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin in the normal 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so expect 5 imps to Israel on 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry on  3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4-fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: line-ups had to be submitted 15 min after the last session of yesterday|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if their are health reasons??|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: some of the player only found out later that the captain had made a switch|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lack of Fantunes may come back to haunt the azurri|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am asked about Fantoni/Nunes. They have joined the international Zimmermann team and will be representing Monaco (along with Helgemo/Helness of Norway) in future international ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: events.|pg||
nt|gracelin: there are behind with 32 boards to go.  Not a usual position at the QF (except in 2007)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Whether such international teams are good for the future of the game is a subject of some debate. Obviously good for certain players' bank balances.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: right 10 more likely|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players use this 2NT to cover various hand types, with 3@C to unravel it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: board 18 corrected|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Grue opens a hand not everyone would.|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Rob Helle is teh coinventor of teh system Muller de Wijs are playing|pg||
nt|athene: overcalls are 3 or 4 cards with a longer suit somewhere else|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H has a chance, 4@S is down on the heart ruff |pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, OR made 5@Cx on bd2, for another 14 to Ned, leading by 25, nice start|pg||
nt|hlortz: well being from US i am rooting for them but its a tough road|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a normal 4@H hand -- should present no problems in bidding or play|pg||
nt|kit: amazingly enough, N-S stopped in 2@H in other room, so chance for big pickup for Italy|pg||
nt|kamyk: kiery ujawnione - mo¿na unikn¹æ rafy 3BA|pg||
nt|athene: i don't mean it necessarily will be better as the cards lie to have south play spades|pg||
nt|athene: but that is what north will be thinking|pg||
nt|athene: that is why he might be reluctant to bid spades himself|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  it puts pressure on opps and that's NS style|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I like Dbl a lot|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Johnny's favorite game try. Bid game and try to make it |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S is too unilateral|pg||
nt|tax456: 2sa è roba nuova|pg||
nt|cuan: 2NT by North not by west|pg||
nt|tax456: ahh|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT makes for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes QF is their achilles heel - and remember they chose China as their opps|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ty ton|pg||
nt|gavin:  I would be shocked if Weinstein opens the west board in the other room, given that they play flannery|pg||
nt|gavin:  the west hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  This hand falls into the "weak majors" range many European players use.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H-1 at the other table, where Brink went for 500 in 4@H. 9 IMPs to Italy.|pg||
nt|brgpro: X would be GF...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Jaap|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rhelle:  2@h = 4@h, 5+@d|pg||
nt|athene: so according to that scheme, lauria could have overcalled 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe, vulnerable, he thinks it's unduly risky|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like fairly old-fashioned precision club, so NS are just bidding naturally after the 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/USA%202/hurd-wooldridge.pdf|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: say LR or bad game raise, danger of getting to bad game|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: interesting point|pg||
nt|roswolf: any shape i assume?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (oh sorry talking about e/w on last hand) |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: rusinow leads|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S   shows spade control?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which doesn't say a lot for their system, NS need to cah their 4 winners|pg||
nt|hlortz: the latest system of game tries is bid game and try to make... should fail here :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@D was one of their transfer responses|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ie. last minute changes may be allowed for non bridge reasons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing   since they didn't pre-submit a convention card for this pairing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably Dble was a transfer to hearts on the first round.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see results from the other table, and even play through any of the hands, via the MOVIE button bottom right.|pg||
nt|sybarra: probable making +2?|pg||
nt|brgpro: will be +1|pg||
nt|brgpro: he won't run @s10, so will lose 2 black tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@s = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2NT = short in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@S transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S transfer to 2NT apparantly|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20  north declined to balance|pg||
nt|ady: even with the balanced shape  3NT could have been in jeopardy on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: will start on @C and probably make 10|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bob|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Bob|pg||
nt|athene: which otherwise you would want to do, with that hand, as a pre-emptive measure, surely?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  surprising that W passed|pg||
nt|jfeld:  wow.|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of intermediates in the south hand creates the game opportunity|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may go to the stratosphere|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: better not to slam here|pg||
nt|brgpro: should stop in 5 but that is already in danger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = game force  no clear bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: quite possible that in the other room west opens a weak 2@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: good convention.|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a diamond guess to make 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@d = 2+ in third seat Vul, because they up the 1NT range to 14-15|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@H IF brave|pg||
nt|eggy:  I don't like pass apposite it though!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 1st double promised 5@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: The use of transfer bids is spreading. Over a double is a good time for them, also facing an overcall.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: dbl is stronger than 2@D (first dbl Madala)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H by South would have shown spades, of course.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south can figure out north's distribution but maybe worried only one D stopper and the club finesse maybe wrong.|pg||
nt|roswolf: madala will bid on here but he might make a club slam try on the way|pg||
nt|brolucius: The effect of a really awful set, such as Italy has just endured, can be to introduce doubt into everything you do subsequently. Whether such general rules apply to the great ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians, we wait to see. |pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting comment david|pg||
nt|gracelin: slam try? I thk south is thinking on to bid 3NT or pass 3C.|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   lost connection     not a clear cut game to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely someone out of 3130 knows the link to the running scores?! I am asked for it.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact 5C also makes and south could move toward that, too.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this italian tem think differently|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: but lauria-versace seem to be very conservative with their weak twos, and weak jump bids in general|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's seems those Italians always have a right gadget to describe their hands perfectly.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if ducked to HQ, a club shift will beat it.  So declarer may decide to go up with HK and wor on spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Narkiewicz bardzo kaszle|pg||
nt|hlortz: is it totally clear to rise aC if decl leads it early?|pg||
nt|ady: 3 diamonds should be down 1   so not much in this hand |pg||
nt|warrens:  how can North not bid 3@S over 3@D?|pg||
nt|athene: i think there might well have been a subtle misunderstanding here for NS|pg||
nt|eggy:  opposite|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with three small @H, what does pd have|pg||
nt|fluffy: Cullin didn't want to bid spades once Hurd show them before (or perhaps he couldn't as it might be taken as cuebid)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: on the SW side W didnt alert the DBL in the first round until a little|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: later|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and then S had allready put down the 1@s bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: obviously a heart lead sets the 9th trick for declarer, but other leads seem to just slow the inevitable|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but after the alert from W -- S took it back -- and shows @s now instead|pg||
nt|brolucius:  Bermuda Bowl running scores: http://goo.gl/26o6o|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: good lead, @h ruff coming up|pg||
nt|brolucius: The spade slam is no good, but they both have a fair hand. South's singleton in partner's hearts is not ad advantage usually.|pg||

nt|rhelle: so 3-3-2-5 hands, 12-13, become unbiddable if 1@d shows 3+|pg||
nt|xenya: duly corrected  - 2@D on 2+ diamonds would be too much, even for these days... |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: welcome Rob|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  990?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Agree with Jack. Automatic 4@S bid. with 3 low hearts and qjx for partner|pg||
nt|jfeld:  yep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H= 2 keycards without trump Q|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he make this after @C lead?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|xenya: hello Rob|pg||
nt|rhelle: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: but unlucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably same bad break in other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: Well done, Madala.  |pg||

pc|dK|nt|rhelle:  3@s = 0-4-6-3|pg||
nt|boedhy:  WIESMULLER = Tarzan that is what they called their system|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Now North knows the @c losers will go on the @s AK|pg||

nt|fabsayc: now they can manage two heart ruffs if they diagnose the layout|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx Jan this might be an UI thing declarer|pg||
nt|fluffy: sadly for wooldridge he has run from a making doubled game|pg||
nt|barnets: X|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rhelle:  so he will get excited!|pg||
nt|kit: And in fact, N-S have profitable save in 5@C, and pushing opponents to 5@H (which likely would have happened) is a big bonus|pg||
nt|athene: slam might be harder to reach if west opened 2@S - what do you do with that north hand? just punt 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, no need to pre-empt opps if they don't bid slams even when given a free run|pg||
nt|athene: really you should not miss this slam|pg||
nt|athene: if you play a strong club and opps politely yield you the floor|pg||
nt|psyck:  Declarer can make if he readds card right|pg||
nt|psyck:  could have also made on @d lead if he guesses right as defense cannot get @d ruff & @c trick|pg||
nt|psyck:  as dec can afford a @c loser if he reads @s, he should avoid the finesse here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: So many plusses in bidding.|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry not|pg||
nt|fluffy: with a spade lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: ducked|pg||
nt|fluffy: it goes down|pg||
nt|xenya: unmakeable on a non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bertheau-cullin  and  nystrom-upmark have had recent successes in ACBL national pair events|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: lall wants to play everything natural after 2@s showing 4@s|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg:  1NT was raptor showing 4@s and a 5 card minor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 5@C XC was a beauty play by Drijver in OR b2|pg||
nt|fluffy: Drijver- Brink playing only 3@s on board 3, this means at least 10 IMPs for Italy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: GM Rob.|pg||
nt|eggy:  well, when your only values are QJx @S you don't even need to check you heart holding surely|pg||
nt|szalay: nice lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fredin dbld 3@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably still gets this right based on Fallenius DBL of 1@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: instable; see http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, take your pick from those while I watch the bridge!|pg||

pc|h7|nt|antoniz: brawo|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd Gosney|pg||
nt|hlortz: well done|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Iceland must watch out, they are quite safe but losing 25-x they might be out|pg||
nt|jfeld:  When in doubt, bidding 4S over 4H is a good policy.|pg||
nt|ady: unblock of clubs here|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead may floor this|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W asking the bid of 2@C...|pg||
nt|roswolf: west considrong rdbling for blood!?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes he is... and asking again |pg||
nt|barnets: I think a heart lead might work ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: might end up shedding his own though|pg||
nt|ady: knock out potential entry with west|pg||
nt|brgpro: when that passed around to S, he would bid 3NT anyway|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rhelle:  4@c = relay, asking for controls|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still needs the third round @H control|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@d = 2 controls; an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he ask for it?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, and he will|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@h = relay, asking for high cards|pg||
nt|ady: 7 easy    8th have to work for|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has too much work|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 17 3nt by W made 11 tricks on the@HQ lead! 11 imps to the azurri|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lesh points out 3N makes while 4@S fails|pg||
nt|dgame: 4@s is a good contract since 4@h cold|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobh1: winning this match might help Poland get back in the hunt|pg||
nt|xenya: not much for the play here -- 3@D just making|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3NT makes too, of course. But hard to bid, as both players have a shaky @c stop|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Live scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|fluffy: excellent double by Per-Ola anyway, you are much more comfortable defending 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: grue saying: 'the King is my play (also)' |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lall: 'I know it's Peter's play'|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@c = @dK, @hK, nothing in @c|pg||
nt|famus: and likely to meet the Italian juggernaut--which met their 'David" in New Zealand yesterday|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi I am back - and as u see 3Nt in OR down 4 board 2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: me toooooooooooo:) (well bid after 4@S:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see how badly the scorned singleton trump lead would fare.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: we must be proactive as commentators|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...with @s 4-1, he might not make this even on @d lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brgpro: because he cant cash the 3rd @D in dummy|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a safety play in trumps, to guard against single @SK offside.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle:  5@d = asking for more high cards|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@s = DQ, not @hQ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  On the last board at the other table Verhees van Prooyen were in the better 3nt contract, which on the layout is cold..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so a good start for teh home team.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so really, NS are unlucky that South's red Q is in @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  otherwise they'd bid 7@d|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would have been better to raise clubs right away|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Doesn't look likely.|pg||
nt|ady: careful defence will beat 3NT  2 hearts 1 club and 2 other aces|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer must guess trumps to make|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like east needs score his @C3  to make this|pg||
nt|barnets: otherwise cant|pg||
nt|barnets: close contract|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  It's pointed out to me my "weak majors" comment was  unclear.  What I meant was that many  of them have a gadget (usually 2@d or 2@h) that shows a weak hand with both majors.|pg||
nt|brgpro: one needs strong nerves to play this set...The Italians are surely more experienced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @S?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: @s|pg||
nt|brgpro: he is still ok...|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @D3 Kevin:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I want to, but I can't|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@c 2@h 2@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|ady: does not yet know of 4 clubs|pg||
nt|brgpro: but he will play a big @c first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  that's why i thought retain extra @S|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: line @HQ @CA @DK a tad technical better imo|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: may cash club and try diamond to the 10|pg||
nt|kamyk: Twoje ulubione silne 2BA te¿ czasem zawiedzie:)|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer could make now 11 tricks for +150, but that is still not much|pg||
nt|brolucius: You employ it when you can afford one loser in the suit but not two.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I missed the club  (guess I tucked into my pocket) so +1|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|barnets: entries mean he is likely to make it on the lucky heart diivision|pg||
nt|warrens:  I can see how N/S might stop in 2@H if S doesn't make a second try|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: VC: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=QF&qroundno=1&qtournid=886|pg||
nt|gavin:  not in USA really|pg||
nt|gavin:  thats much more of a european thing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah  always needs at least 3@C so @S is mirage|pg||
pc|cK|nt|boedhy:  still think a lot of pairs will end up in 7 @d tho and i dont see a way to make it|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@h I don't understand - that is a sign-off|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in my version - clearly they play this differently|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3 boards total 35 imps is a rocket start|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: not with S imo|pg||
nt|athene: south thinks that his free 2@S bid showed a really good hand |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rhelle:  I guess that they could sign off in 5@d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  taht should be possible...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 5@h is the relay, and 5NT shows the @dQ and denies the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: that will bring 8 tricks  unless 6 card spade suit out|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: dont think so Barnet   favour diamond to the 10|pg||
nt|lechcold: to jest broñ obosieczna:)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
nt|psyck:  well played|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: as we all?|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case north has a 3@S bid?|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, it must, his partner hasn't promised anything|pg||
nt|fabsayc: guessing KJ combinations is a real status thing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes a good defense should be down|pg||
nt|brgpro: had the @d been 4-3, then maybe it depends on the lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|boedhy:  then now he is counting his tricks|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that would be useful refinement|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and stops at 12|pg||

nt|ady: not to desparate   1 imp difference|pg||

nt|ady: carefull sets up 9th trick with 2nd diamond|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: really|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: -200 likely now|pg||

mb|2N|nt|kit: I totally agree with this call.  South knows his side has at least 8 clubs and E-W have at least 8 hearts, so odds in favor of competing to 3@C|pg||

nt|jcwla:  Running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=881 |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  is S thinking of acting?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Joel thinking how high to bid. I bet he bids|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no it is W thinking|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S has bid 3@h|pg||
nt|fluffy: Per-Ola decided not to double 1@c with his hand, perhaps for the vulnerability|pg||
nt|fluffy: wonder if he would had opened had east passed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: none of this has improved Fallenius' hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: ON  4 N/S PLAYING IN 3NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess 2C showed both majors.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will eiher bid 4H directly or X to invte.|pg||
nt|roswolf: o feel italy are steming over the horizon|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still a possible slam from South's point of view.|pg||
nt|brgpro: many play 3@h as a mixed raise here ( 2-5 with distribution 6-8 without)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Kamil might not open in 3rd seat a hand Grue-Lall would open in any seat.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile Indonesia get 7 back on 20|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: will west try science or a simple 5@d?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: What a hand |pg||
nt|ady: hearts best spot for n/s|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@H down because of @S ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may sac in @D|pg||
nt|xenya: 4N -- 2 suits|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good bid, 4NT.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Interesting 4@s bid from East. There is a school of thought (I adhere to it) that suggests to always raise your partner's preempt with 3-card support|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi CK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C transfer not accepted I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but positive so good slam may be reached|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1C natural and promises at least two clubs, 10-22 points.|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well, how does 1 @D suit you by n/s?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...that was a bit unexpected|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed, East would normally re-open with a double.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a quieter hand|pg||
nt|pawel90: NS maj¹ tu do wygrania nawet 5@H, ale obrona pikami jest dobra na kazdej wysokosci|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes @D the old joke what do u call an 8 card suit? trump!|pg||
nt|warrens:  an aggressive 5@C works.  Kit, you must love this :)|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult problem for Stansby, but he would have done a lot better doubling and collecting 500|pg||
nt|ady: defence can take spade and spade ruff   but nothing else|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes they may phantom|pg||
nt|roswolf: THE VUL MAY TEMPT THEM|pg||
nt|ady: 3 losers in diamonds  so can sacrifice at the 6 level|pg||
nt|oosmanb: into writing in all caps? :)|pg||
nt|xenya: even with a doubleton honour i would say...|pg||
nt|xenya: well, occasionally perhaps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D/@H both make on @H finesse, may be difficult to bid.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes. In this case, without the 4@s bid, South would have 2 rounds of bidding more, and could show his @s void|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the meantime North is regretting opening on an 11-count 4333 :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: a hand that Vul I'd never open|pg||
nt|xenya: he will be happy he did eventually|pg||
nt|fluffy: otherwise the hand owuld be headed for all pass!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  He does open it.|pg||
nt|dgame: dewi calculate the chance of slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=@H raise|pg||
nt|ady: lowish part score    hearts v spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not a successful lead     heart works out better|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting as well what 4NT actually means in this situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Krishna|pg||
nt|dgame: support 4 cards @s|pg||
nt|brgpro: W could have bid something as well after 1@d overcall...but won't be a big difference, this will go -1 to -2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rhelle:  North feels he is too weak to handle 1NT X|pg||
nt|kit: And here it pushed opponents to poor game|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S play 15+ - 18 for 1NT, so North was a shade light for that opening bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "good dummy" says Einarsson after W put down his cards - I agree :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and W layed down his @sK as it was just a small @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in between|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some will bid as W|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can save for around  eight or eleven hundred|pg||
nt|famus: how much is 6@s costing|pg||
nt|xenya: N has a choice of bids -- 5@C/@D/@H|pg||
nt|athene: interesting use of double - few pairs play this way|pg||
nt|ady: not wild about east overcall of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: east may go for the spade lead on this bidding?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: dbl usually shows 4@s, but can be done on less, like on this hand. 1@s would show 5@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  operator adds 2 bids at the time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: exactly|pg||
nt|fluffy: everything is lieing well enough for EW, and 11 tricks are possible on a spade guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: but soth's silence makes it unlikelly for declarer to paly him for this strong spade holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  4  Pachtmann didn't bid with Fleisher hand|pg||
nt|ady: 22 pts game    but suitable values|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room long tank by north over whether to leave in the X of 3@d|pg||
nt|gavin:  Fleisher's second double just says I'm alive partner, we have the balance of the deck|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: to get 3@S own not so easy|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: needs @C ruff|pg||
nt|ady: will have to work for it    may go wrong  on diamond swich later|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: 20-20 split here|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@c is 10-15, with some poetic license 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: silence|pg||
nt|roswolf: no caps lock on the blink:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so the players cannot know who is thinking from the operator|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H by W was an option but took the low road|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so the players cant here on the mouseclick is who hesitating or not|pg||
nt|jfeld:  surprising Einarsson did not want to look for slam with controls in the other suits and a good source of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I prefer to not be in slam missing A + trump Q|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  unless I have 10 trumps - then you can actually show trump Q in RKC Blackwood without having it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: th concept of maximum and minimum weak two bids depend where you live|pg||
nt|szalay: its originally a Dutch convention|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and position of the moon|pg||
nt|szalay: backfired now as well|pg||
nt|jillan:  AND who is playing them|pg||
nt|szalay: because of gave 2 much information|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|idc: The defence had to stay away from both pointed suits here (@s & @d) which wasn't an easy task for them|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's just hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|rhelle: although South is not allowed to draw this inference, he knows that North has a long think over 4NT|pg||
nt|athene: if west's redouble of the negative double would have shown a heart honour, then east knows the hearts probably won't get the job done|pg||
nt|brolucius: Diamond bidding may have helped South to judge that North would not have much wasted in diamonds. No, he has passed 3@H. |pg||
nt|barnets: china got to 3@H freely on 19 on spade lead so italy should pick up 4 imps|pg||
nt|brolucius: He judges that West would have bid (Dble, 1@H or 1@S) if he had anything. Even so....|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised E didnt balance with double,  sort of "perfect" shape |pg||
nt|brolucius: 9 out of 10 would have doubled, I guess.|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S find 7 tricks?|pg||
nt|brolucius: We won't see many 1@D contracts in these championships (thank goodness).|pg||
nt|brgpro: very difficult|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Aust allowed to make that 4@S for an early 12 imp lead|pg||
nt|antoniz: ciekawa rozgrywka|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie trafi³ po prostu po³o¿enia króla pik|pg||
nt|antoniz: 4pik by³o za 300|pg||
nt|psyck:  whatever it was, it worked|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will sac on insurance principles?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: how bad is 6@H without looking at ew cards i.e @S distribution|pg||
nt|bobh1: W will lead a @S but E will not know why|pg||
nt|ady: even without a spade lead   only can make 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: East probably doubled|pg||
nt|bobh1: is it because he has a singleton or because of the rdbl|pg||
nt|nkgupt: golden cards and layout|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is entitled to suppress cue-bidding a king on a poor hand. But not an ace.|pg||
nt|ady: switch|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: the 2nt was ""blocking"" a @S supoort by N i think|pg||
nt|brgpro: but once @hK is wrong placed, 3@s can go a lot down, N would never try that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no i think 2N=inv+ raise|pg||
nt|brgpro: how could N know his @hK was well placed|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: would he not bid 2@S wheb W 2@H?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: this may well fail|pg||
nt|psyck:  W did not want to bid his poor @s suit i presume|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not surprised if the director was called at the end of this board|pg||
nt|xenya: normal treatment|pg||
nt|ady: good lead    without the 10@D 3NT could just be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|athene: going for diamonds is not a bad shot|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand the Q from W here|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @D8 was better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D  4th suit force|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will grue split his honors when fallenius leads up a @d?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C as weak two in diamonds or strong hand was invented by ira rubin and played by him in 1966 world championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: win 1st @S often highlights fear of shift to another suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: italian system  2N almost always raise of major|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: So another 10 IMP's for Italy|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But given 3@S was a singleton, really shouldnt venture 6|pg||
nt|jfeld:  agree, not a great slam here.|pg||
nt|fluffy: if Hurd manages to ruff 3 diamonds in dummy he won't need to guess teh spades|pg||
nt|fluffy: but I think he doesn't have enough entries for that|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh well south has to lead first! and spade lead is appealing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the trick is to not reach 7|pg||
nt|dgame: have all controls|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rhelle:  South is now advertising a rally big hand - and North will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  bidding 3NT yourself much safer|pg||
nt|rhelle:  9 tricks are of course easy once the @cQ drops|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so the NS aggressive auction looks like paying off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well it is sort of lucky offcourse on a @s lead you need that|pg||
nt|antoniz: 5karo mo¿na wygraæ,ale 4pik zawsze -1|pg||
nt|jkotor: znaczy jak w koñcu S otworzy kiera, co jest raczej oczywiste|pg||
nt|ady: now 13 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: good sac|pg||
nt|bobh1: he will work it out because of the auction|pg||
nt|xenya: and this makes -- somewhat fortituously|pg||
nt|rhelle: Now, how should East signal? He 'knows' the @sAce will be ruffed|pg||
nt|xenya: you normally don't bid a slam missing an ace and the trump King|pg||
nt|fluffy: there you go, now he will make if he plays trumps before north ruffs a spade|pg||
nt|fluffy: if he plays a diamond, he will later need to play @cA+@c to avoid the ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess that means 3@C would show  5413 distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise it seems to me more important to tell about @C filler|pg||
nt|ady: surprised    |pg||
nt|gracelin: he made a discipline pass.  He let north decide how many D honors are wasted.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: on board 2 grue-lall beat 4@H, they are saying declarer misplayed it, i am not so sure|pg||
nt|dgame: 6 is just enough|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players would not have bid 3@C, vulnerable, worried that partner might have only 3 clubs. But you can see that making that pre-emptive bid has pushed E/W around.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is likely to have 1 honor for the bidding, if it's a @h this is a good contract.  The @sk dooms it.|pg||
nt|kit: Still likely 1 loser in each suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually it has value|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêd¹ punkty w 19, nasi nie poszli w obronê pikami|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm slighty unexpectedly a vul game swing opportunity for the chinese|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's double was a game invitation and he stodd by North's decision. 3@H by South would not have been invitational.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what the mean with cuebid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Gerben42:  a practical lead - looking for the 2nd trick assuming @HA is the first|pg||
nt|brgpro: unless defenders help |pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: not easy to defend here?|pg||
nt|szalay: NOW he will split for sure|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in the bowl Italy have scored 16-0 after 3 boards vs NL|pg||
pc|hT|nt|boedhy:  and 109xx of @d helps bogtime with that lead|pg||
nt|idc: Hard ask for East to lead a trump from a singleton at trick one, but a @c lead would have given declarer more problems|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: @cAQ throw a @s on @cJ|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sweet choice for Poles|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think i would do so too at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: excellent save|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: on the 5@DX-2 Italy 4@H-1|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Earlier Grue commented "I have been known to open 13 counts :)" after Kamil said "You guys don't open light or anything do you?"|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kit: Need both king and 10 of spades onside|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S easy making, so looks like a +board for Sweden|pg||
nt|psyck:  also may have been worried of 3@s being passed if pd was weaker|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  claim +1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now it is really difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but very understandable that Kamil was worried about leading toward @HT9xx|pg||
nt|brgpro: now @dQ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe  cue=3-fit game force  2N=3+fit inv|pg||
nt|brgpro: E has to guess if it is from QJx or QJ bare|pg||
nt|brgpro: QJx he has to duck and QJ bare he has to cover|pg||
nt|brgpro: the DUtch standard is to play the @dJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: long haul to 4th spade    meantime club switch best|pg||
nt|ady: then still 3 losers|pg||
nt|athene: well, the queen would be right if his partner had @DKxxx|pg||
nt|warrens:  only right if partner has led from AKxx|pg||
nt|athene: leton|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now where is that 'Well stopped' comment I had to cancel earlier?|pg||
nt|brgpro: but that is the only card to give declarer a guess|pg||
nt|nkgupt: if @hk wrong for NS it is right for EW so they wud be very near 4@h making :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|boedhy:  bigtime|pg||
nt|warrens:  and declarer has 10x|pg||
nt|fluffy: notice the important @s8 unblock from hand, this might probe vital in the end when he fineses south for the 9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jaapfr vg: but still N would make 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer @DA10 doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: 9@D better  first trick from west  but then declarer would then play the clubs safely so west could not get on trick|pg||
nt|xenya: neither N nor S have any idea of W's club holding|pg||
nt|gracelin: closed room is unlikely to bid this game either.  North is not strong enough for the 14-16 1NT so will open 1D, showing 11-13 if balanced.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well bid, not much to the play|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  Drijver in 4@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if 3@S down 2 4@H likely to make (agree)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: so 8 tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  or Kxxx|pg||
nt|eggy:  certainly poor after North's double I think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42:  +2 even|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarers failure to play on diamonds indicates he has at most one card in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this line screams singleton @D|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rhelle:  another claim - 10 tricks|pg||
nt|pawel90: jakby Piotr zagrywa³ atuta ze sto³u unikna³by promocji. Tak -2|pg||
nt|ady: as mentioned North might have had A10 dbleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H continue gives declarer a chance|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if -100,  might not be too bad v 1 or 2 sp |pg||
pc|s5|nt|resurectin:  Hi all|pg||
nt|brgpro: now @h10 switch...cant avoid losing 2 tricks in each major|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Declarer discards an established club, not expecting to get to dummy. |pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: had west held only 3 clubs 6@C would be cold on @s finesse|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three 'certain' losers and you need luck in both spades and trumps.|pg||
nt|roswolf: par!?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and he's taken it|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|antoniz: po piku,partner wyrzuci Waleta karo- to nakaz w kiera|pg||
nt|fluffy: now if @c 2-2 the contract is safe, he has to now find something that makes if clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3-1|pg||
nt|fluffy: he can play for clubs 3-1 and spades 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: ruffing diamond in dummy a heart in hand, a diamond in dummy and pulling trumps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hlortz: needs to find Sj t.o dbl gives clue|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: ooh double game swing USA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  intersting hand ... expect fireworks!|pg||
nt|kit: Flannery, may be 4-6 or even 5-6 as we see here|pg||
nt|xenya: they were just a bit slow -- no big deal|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: will not or did not?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|boedhy:  offcourse South Africa not among the favorites|pg||
nt|rhelle:  true - but a very solid team|pg||
nt|brolucius: Terence Reese once described Flannery as the worst bidding convention ever invented. "It copes with a distribution that causes no problen whatsoever with natural bidding,' was his ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: view.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: at this vul they open weak nt|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Not everybody's 2@h bid...|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes 4@h let thru in OR|pg||
nt|ady: might be 1@S passed out again|pg||
nt|pelu: ok when he lose 3 @D-tricks - then down 1 :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@d|pg||
nt|brgpro: hopefully the 2 or 3 imps won't be decisive|pg||
nt|sybarra: Are we seeing a bit of nerves here?   or just unlucky hands? |pg||
nt|brolucius: Raining heavily outside, so what could be better than watching bridge at this level? (Yes, playing in bridge at this level, but...)|pg||
nt|brgpro: let's see how high will NS sacrifice |pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  although Apteker Gower are a good international pair|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 4 isreal bid to 4@S down 2 off the top|pg||
nt|ady: all game down I would think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=@C & @D   if he's good enough for that|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@D at least three diamonds and 11-21 points.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|boedhy:  And teh Netherlands are among the topfavorites especially on home turf|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@c will be lead directing|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is very high up on Roland Wald's list of the world's 10 worst conventions too.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Roland agrees.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It has always staggered me that so many very good players use it.|pg||
nt|kit: big advantage of Flannery is that you don't have to respond 1@S to 1@H on a 4-bagger, so opener knows it shows 5.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, it will be 12-14|pg||
nt|gracelin: There is an excellent interview to Bocchi on the net.  I just don't know how to copy to long address to present to you.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@s asks for minor|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d shows more d@s than @cs|pg||
nt|ady: games|pg||
nt|ady: but the majors only can make 7 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  bd 1 might have worked out differently on another lead, then 4 and this thin slam "missed"|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  many pairs play 2@C as a gadget here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I guess 2@c is Gazzilli like|pg||
nt|fluffy: he actually combined both chances sorry|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, north could have stronger trumps and weaker spade so there's no trump finesse to take.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer might have made last hand by ruffing a diamond when in dummy|pg||
nt|brolucius: Duboin's 300 phantom sacrifice has cost 9 IMPs.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: awful board here for NS|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  S was planing to reverse, now what?|pg||
nt|brgpro: 6@d is not cheap though...|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2@c=@h i believe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many would show the two-suiter on the West cards (with a Michaels 2@D) but E/W do not play that method. They favour a sort of Ghestem.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  well ... I think Italy is very strong, especially in the absence of the alltime strong USA teams|pg||
nt|brolucius: Roland thinks the convention is so totally awful that he forbids commentators to use the F-word. (I will let your one aberration go unreported on this ocasion, Kit.)|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@c is minimum & without 4 card @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Some won't with 4 cards in the other major, some won't with a void, some will with one of those flaws but not both.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 to 15|pg||
nt|roswolf: well not with the 1NT overcall i think - but what do i know?:)|pg||
nt|ady: board 4 was in fact a push   also 3NT n/s    and thankfully for Italy not 3@DX|pg||
nt|fabsayc: instead of playing a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 5@H now by west|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 7@d X par |pg||
nt|brgpro: they still play mini NT here 4th hand? maybe 12-14|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lechcold: WE graj¹ Precison|pg||
nt|idc: a 3@d response to 2NT would have been 4 diamonds, min or max|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very costly for Australia|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some back here I expect|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a razorblade sharp 4@S needs @C lead to beat?|pg||
nt|ady: no   strong club |pg||
nt|ady: minors have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@D shows three diamonds only with 4-4-3-2 shape.|pg||
nt|barnets: on 19 remarkeably e/w switched after spade lad and allowed dec 11 tricks when he only had 8|pg||
nt|psyck: 7@d may save an imp i suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Grue had 3@S explained to him in detail and then quickly bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  South X of 5@c is interesting|pg||
nt|kit: Well, if I get fired it won't be the first time in my life :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: The x took no room, 4@c might have given e a problem --  although not in this case.|pg||
nt|daman:  http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/and-now-lets-talk-about-bridge-interview-to-norberto-bocchi.html|pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks, George.  You helped me out|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@D nic o karach nie mówi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H denies 4-fit   not sure if they ever superaccept w/3-fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you did it al, jinked the cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guilty|pg||
nt|psyck: would you consider 4@h instead of 4@d by E Martin?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now i would definitely bid slam with bathurst hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 4@H is fine if a fit jump, i dont play them|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, by passed hand, not much else it can be...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i play it as a splinter|pg||
nt|psyck: ok|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|boedhy:  yes probably has a specific meaning..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  showing the desire to compete|pg||
nt|famus: at worst wud b a 5IMP swing--dunno|pg||
nt|kit: tempting to bid game with 3 aces, even though only 12 points and 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  some have names of players like Gazzilli, there's also Bart and Lisa convention :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and now he has done his part and passes|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|ady: might make only 9 if spade is ducked early by defence|pg||
nt|ady: when hearts split well will have 9 tricks and be relucant ti risk diamond finesse|pg||
nt|idc: as has been pointed out to me, a good thing E-W missed their @s fit|pg||
nt|hlortz: fredin will NOT go down this time :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt : 4@Hs + 5 toptrricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: i predict...|pg||
nt|rhelle: so West's game try is aggressive|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: looks like it works now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and in scandinavia I have heard about "Hexan"|pg||
nt|fluffy: wooldridge not excited about the game try in clubs :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: his @sKQ are more useful than he thinks, still 3@h will have a lot of trouble to make|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "Sorry for what I am about to show" says Wooldridge before putting his cards on the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4  Levin-Weinstein stop in 5@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5D has chance but maybe difficult to handle.|pg||
nt|brgpro: in @c...u will be forced and in @d contract, W will get some @c ruffs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rhelle:  NS need to cash their 3 tricks in a hurry|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but looking at the hands....|pg||
nt|daman:  my oleasure     a great interview|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d = more @ds than @cs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem here was the wide range 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: needs to win in east hand to make 12|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see that but he is trying to guarantee just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: on this lead|pg||
nt|barnets: there is no absolute guarantee I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: take the A , play @D and then take safety play perhaps for 9|pg||
nt|barnets: when he loses the lead the def shift to a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: attitude lead|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if any Multi 2@d users will play 6@h by West and suffer a ruff at trick one|pg||
nt|idc: or perhaps East passes in some matches and West becomes declarer that way|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ady: ?|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  otherway up|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S may make if they let him get the 4th @D to discard a @C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes so no @C lead for declarer|pg||
nt|gulyas: @DQ lead looks normal, then game is cold|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@S forcing 1n 2nd neg like 0-5 i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll pass non-vul|pg||
nt|pelu: no bet from me :)|pg||
nt|ady: 100 to poland   rather than a dodgy 130 bidding on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead and off.|pg||
nt|ady: this looks destined to be 1 down|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: down if @D played|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: back live again|pg||
nt|ady: but now on that lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: now made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with NS never bidding   i think that is very lucky result for LW|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i expect the italians to be there anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: akurat w przypadku otwarcie 1@D nazwa "Precision" nie jest zbyt trafna:)|pg||
nt|idc: after a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|ady: yes     that is true|pg||
nt|gulyas: here she comes|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has plenty of problems in 3@H here.  Play at trick 1 itself is far from clear.|pg||
nt|kit: Due to the entry situation he will probably play hearts leading them twice from dummy, which is not a success on this layout.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well done|pg||
nt|ady: game  should be difficult on the lay|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: lucky guys, yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D should be easy enough, maybe club to Q and H finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: where we saw 5@CX down 1 e/w Italy in 4@SX on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3NT by S is a "better" contract...(might avoid a @h lead)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: without @H lead 3nt fine chance (@D lead expected)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's the sort of hand where South might say. It all depends on the clubs, so I might as well be in 3NT.|pg||
nt|brgpro: so N has treated his hand a 15-17 unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: that is why S is thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the clubs don't come in, I may go down in 2NT. (Not that such logic has ever impressed me too much).|pg||
nt|brgpro: he is worried that pd might be short in @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  5! is cold|pg||
nt|kit: Good judgment by all to reach par here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no disrespect, but predictions involving fredin are precarious|pg||
nt|pelu: DD 6@C can make, but "impossible" to bid - and against all odds|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right, Martin, but when he see 9 "sure" tricks in 3NT - |pg||
nt|fabsayc: we see 9, he does not|pg||
nt|pelu: he hasa to be carefull in start - if @Ss 5-2|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure he "see" 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off|pg||
nt|fluffy: with a club lead perhaps he would stand a chance, now he doesn't have enough entries to try double finese in hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is on a knife-edge|pg||
nt|gracelin: undo|pg||
nt|brolucius: Switch-bids are when you switch the meaning of 2@C and 2@H. They are explained in an imminent book (Bridge at the Edge) written by Boye Brogeland... and a co-author I am too modest ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: to mention. |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West does not want to play a second top spade here.|pg||
nt|hlortz: might w dbl 3@S with the intent to pull @c to @D?|pg||
nt|kit: He will use this entry to make a spade play I'm pretty sure.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if north has 5 spades there is no 100% line, but on hand just playing hearts will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: you have not lost connection - it is Cullin doing some thinking |pg||
nt|xenya: now, that was an imaginative lead by N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing @S stop|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer must have ruffed|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are likely to be in 3NT here...but the lack of the @c8 might be the problem. if declarer plays @d himself, then he is likely to go down. but if not, then N will be throw in at ...|pg||
nt|brgpro: some stage|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  @s|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the @s8 will be lavinthal for @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  South can see he needs 2 @d tricks to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he needs the @dK in North|pg||
nt|rhelle:  might as well play the @dJ now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Fredin says "ill be very surprised if i get down on this one"|pg||
nt|brgpro: that makes 3NT a terrible contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D might be a bit easier no?|pg||
nt|brgpro: -3|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @cA lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: then E has 2 entries to give pd 2 ruffs for -3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if same as  Duboin-Sementa   2@D just denies 4@H  and 2@H asks for 4@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: in fact needed a club lead|pg||
nt|ady: unless going wrong with spades|pg||
nt|ady: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  2@D said min, not 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @H |pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  2@D=a) not 4@H/@S, min  b) 4@S, not 4@H, min/max|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: most logical lines go down now imo|pg||
nt|ady: this should be down 1 unless defence faulters     lead was good|pg||
nt|brgpro: N has only 3@h and @s are 3-3...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how did he guess @H over @S?|pg||
nt|brgpro: not easy to play but even more difficult to defend if declarer does not try his luck in @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S worth more in pip count :)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 50% taken rightly by N....on the bidding he had to choose a M|pg||
nt|ady: even spade lead    still a trick short|pg||
nt|brgpro: playing on @d is the logical line, so more likely to go down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh of course  2@H asked for 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should have read my own copy/paste|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: sorry i do not see any dfenders problem after his beauty @H lead?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i had an obliged 24 hours free (no internet:(|pg||
nt|brgpro: after @h lead, win in hand then a small @s to the 10...S gets in and must play a @D to beat this i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do play Smith at trick 2|pg||
nt|ady: why   you think declarer wont play diamonds    ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @S5 if read as high  will say  I don't like @H|pg||
nt|brgpro: when in with @sQ, S must play a @D...that is my impression|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: but if N in can safely play a small  club to get off the hook|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D shift rather than @C might be too difficult|pg||
nt|nkgupt: why not @sj for rev smith if they play that:)|pg||
nt|ady: south will play a heart   most likely     but declarer will play diamonds|pg||
nt|drewsky: If they indeed play reeverse smith, then JACK @S is correct play at trick 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly  @SJ!!|pg||
nt|drewsky: I hear an echo :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry    Standard Smith   so @S3 says   not @H|pg||
nt|nkgupt: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: as more boards this b 22 can become decisive in who will go to the final:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: They show standard count on king lead 5-level or higher contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will have given count.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and make 10|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: better than the arvitrary 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 3 pades, 3 hearts and @CA for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fallenius taking the ace very fast|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Fredin: never see him take a card that fast :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Not a lead to engender fear in declarer's heart.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gulyas: it maybe tricky if they play a @C back|pg||
nt|ady: good lead     may be able to force and entry to west hand in diamonds for a heart finesse |pg||
nt|psyck:  I don't think S had a further bid on 2N|pg||
nt|brolucius: What is partner meant to do over 3@S if he is short in clubs, though?|pg||
nt|brgpro: Duboin might just lead a @D( no 1@h overcall anyways)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: bid 3nt:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: IF a man can find a @H lead it is W|pg||
nt|brgpro: on any other lead 3NT is 9 and on @h lead...i believe it goes down more often than making|pg||
nt|brgpro: but at least NS managed to make S the declarer here|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yes specs we know on any lead 10 tricks but that is DD (in reality 99 out of 100 do finesse @C)|pg||
nt|brolucius: His alternative response was 1NT, which would have the same effect.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think in almost all other tables it will be played by N|pg||
nt|brolucius: The only hope is that South has miscounted his clubs and will play for the drop, thinking that he has 9 clubs between the hands.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: he definetely is considering a @H lead now|pg||
nt|brgpro: will a @h hit the table?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: y|pg||
nt|brgpro: then we need a 10-15 seconds applause|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: clap clap clap|pg||
nt|brgpro: i am clapping now!|pg||
nt|brolucius: They bid only 4@S at the table where 6@S went down here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..other table..|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: aunt truus makes 3nt but no expert:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: i will be very careful next time i play against this man...dont mess around with him|pg||
nt|ady: will only make if defenders try attacking clubs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: now he has the guarantee for his contract|pg||
nt|pawel90: niestety treflowy tu obk³ada³|pg||
nt|roswolf: being the operator is a hard job - they ALWAYS have my sympathy for any errors they may make:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: In a social game, East would say 'What a brilliant partner I have!' but that is not allowed here.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Now, when West shifts to a heart East will have to deduce that reason West didn't cash second spade is that it isn't cashing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: bound to lose the @D for safety|pg||
nt|famus: gets an additional entry|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides have used trump leads on defense well|pg||
nt|athene:  hi :)|pg||
nt|athene:  sry private :)|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 9@S entry   so should make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I'm a big fan of BART|pg||
nt|jfeld:  esp reverse BART|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now Wooldridge at a crossroads|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I'm currently reading Rodwell's book and cutting communication by the defense, that works here :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a @H return strands dummy's @C|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will of course shift to a trmp|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gracelin: 3C is also making here, so either 9 or 10 tricks will result in a tied board|pg||
nt|idc: Now declarer can claim, overtrick if @sK right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: try this if you want to see live play, not very exciting http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|hlortz: this looks 2 off but i may wrong by a trick|pg||
nt|gracelin: cross ruff will start|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  30   3N South but Brink leads @S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@D to 11-15 punktów bez starszej pi¹tki i uk³adów pasuj¹cych do otwarcia 2@C|pg||
nt|kamyk: no i to w³anie jest precyzyjne opisanie charakteru rêki:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we agree on most pairs will bid this and most will make it?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...he can find the lead but Brink can still drop his Q...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|malpaluche: @d j'aurais compris|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is always too easy for the operator to play the card played to the next trick - i know!:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: 5@c is better...2 rounds of @s declarer can discard his losing @H...so probably less down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: East has advertised length in the majors, so declarer will probably play West for the @DQ.|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say north had K10xx in diaimonds and hearts were 4-2|pg||
nt|jkotor: 4@s na przeciwnej, ³adnie naszych wyblokowali|pg||
pc|sK|nt|boedhy:  difficult to see who must bid again|pg||
nt|kit: will just have easy squeeze -- will not need to finesse|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|kit: Note Levin's heart plays -- trying to hide king of hearts so declarer places him with other high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer just needs one of SA/HK to be on side.  In fact both are.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the t/o X was left in for 300 OR|pg||
nt|gracelin: Guess 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but think  South has a sort of lesser rick decision|pg||
nt|boedhy:  risk|pg||
nt|kit: I doubt if declarer will be fooled here, but still good defensive technique|pg||
nt|brgpro: still, -500 is not bad, EW can make 650|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the face of it, the @C3 was suit-preference for a heart switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The second ruff will be lost if West tries to cash the @SK.|pg||
nt|brgpro: true, Versace is trying to figur out if declarer is 2-0-6-5 or 1-1-6-5|pg||
nt|brolucius: That's right.|pg||
nt|brgpro: however, i would think with 2-0-6-5, S might not pass on 3@h|pg||
nt|brgpro: he might just bid 4@c and may not save over 4@s because he is void in pd's supposed strong suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not much different, in that respect, and 3@H was forcing anyway - so he might pass on any sort of hand.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 'might not save' is perhaps a stronger inference, you are right.|pg||
nt|brgpro: dont forget, pd's 2@C showed @h and can be a good hand. with void in pd's good suit, would he save?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Somehow we always expect the Italians to 'get it right'. Not possible, of course.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has no way to find out pd has 4 or 5 @s which is important to him|pg||
nt|drewsky: In any event, I predict down one for VP's hreat lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|barnets: he would be down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must have been @SK  asking for unblock or count   then @Sx|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lechcold: w niektórych wersjach mo¿e byæ nawet renons karo|pg||
nt|barnets: on a spade switch|pg||
nt|ady: 1 imp for USA|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  problem is he doesnt know that much about E distribution|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: guess he will cross ruff to 10 tricks for the same imp as 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|twcho: best if EW plays non-leaping Michael here|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to decide if he plays for the @HA to be onside, or the @Ds to be good, but this is better, of course|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised he got the hearts right considering the entry problems.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: club back too late|pg||
nt|xenya: if N goes up @CA on the second club that is|pg||
nt|drewsky: great|pg||
nt|brgpro: now no more problems for defense|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brgpro: do we hear the 2nd WOW?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: K:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: long thinking the J I presume|pg||
nt|brgpro: percentage play is the J...but....|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer is looking to see if the opponent on his side of the screen is going red in the face (increased blood pressure).|pg||
nt|brgpro: ii am holding my breath...|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: are we stuck?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am not going to say well done if he plays for the drop. Why should he?|pg||
nt|brgpro: why shouldn't he?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: better breath again|pg||
nt|brolucius: Because it is hugely against the odds.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: should get this right|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: he will is my bet|pg||
nt|ady: can be a nice swing for Autralia|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @D lead not so clear so mb a push more realistic?|pg||
nt|xenya: S must go up @DA |pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  North never had chance to show help in @H   Upmark needs to guess @H later in the hand and gets it right|pg||
nt|brolucius: The standard has been very good at this tournament - the result of many practice sessions (Roland Wald tells me).|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: but be careful for -2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: he is happy with 9|pg||
nt|fluffy: wow! he played almost double dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that part is easy :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well played!|pg||
nt|brgpro: aiiiiiiiiiiiii|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has to find it out from the bidding...although that might not look as clear as we see it...cause we see all the cards and will always find a reason to support us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck @SJ gives Verhees problems|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if he had play @HJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: now he might reject the H finesse for a safe 9 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck:  so the swings continue & the score reamins tight|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that was understandable. Kibs tell me that East asked for a heart. Yes, but he would do that with @HA-Q-x too.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: When declarer runs the trumps West will have to keep the @SA and so unguard the diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would allow declarer to pick up the suit when West held x-x-x (and had to throw one) and East started with Q-x. |pg||
nt|santyclz: China took a 5 imp lead when on bd 2 w chose to lead the @dk, s ruffed the 3rd round high and finessed into the stiff @cq.|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|brolucius: The diamond position is known as a show-up squeeze, because East's @DQ-x may become 'shown up' after West has been forced to discard a diamond. When West follows low on the 2nd ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: round, his card is known to be his last in the suit.|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense is playing with fire, jorgensen needs to avoid getting endplayed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade jack shift was totally safe after east discarded two cards in suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most pairs have gone to using King as strong lead against NT   in previous millenium Ace was the power lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42:  not sure if its findable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most operators are from the Netherlands but they had a few requests from far-flung lands too.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Thx Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: and well done to Roland on his IBPA Award:)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: no @D is sure down 1|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fluffy: great job by hurd|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gracelin: HA and HJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: even on a club lead  the defeence not clear cut|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|xenya: no chance now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S was minors --- Barel 3N denied 4card fit   so Zack gambled|pg||
nt|brgpro: well.....had he realised the @h lead was from the J ( they lead the smallest one from KJxxx)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|brgpro: exit with either M|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: squeeze of N but dummy squeezed first|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h5|nt|nkgupt: dont really understand the @dk...only causes heart attacks:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: declarer i meant|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brgpro: they play attitute leads|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|ady: I feel Verace knows his fate|pg||
pc|c7|nt|brgpro: then with an H in @s and KQ10xx in @h and @cQ...E might have overcalled 1@h...|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he had two diamonds it might be different. He could play for the drop in clubs and then try for 5 diamond tricks if the @CQ did not fall.|pg||
nt|brgpro: all depends on how he read the @h5 then the 2|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|gluckenval: in chiusa 3@C classico, 3@D = 1 o 2 quarte nobili, e 4@D che mostra almeno 4/4 nobile ma solo da manche |pg||

mb|p|nt|rialc2: ha detto 4@D(?)|pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|rialc2: questo non ha capito|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: E: "@ss are always 5-0"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1 out of 100 will find he deadly @C lead imo|pg||
nt|gulyas: after the @DQ lead, he would play for the likely @DJ onside|pg||
nt|ady: long diamond can be set up before club is established for defence|pg||
nt|famus: that was odd|pg||
nt|ady: did not see the lay  but cant see how only  6 tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: its 2@S just made, so 8|pg||
nt|ady: did not see the play|pg||
nt|famus: did he go for @cs?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes -200 seems odd|pg||
nt|xenya: on 5, the Dutch NS alwso got to slam, 6@D, losing 2 imps  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 boards so far and close match.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: nice 4@H here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 21   2@D-end   so i think sweden takes the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: the table is discussing whether bidding 7@d is good or not|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they agree that it is interesting at matchpoints|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: -1 only???|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Grue a bit upset, Lall saying "He would've guessed it"|pg||
nt|brgpro: one less undertrick...but that was a doubled undertr|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 6@S C|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The other table is slow so we won't be getting comparisons for a while, Brazil will feel that slam is a potential gain|pg||

nt|jfeld:  For those of you interested in reading about BART: http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/conventions/106-other-conventions/157-bart-modified|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  West 2NT?|pg||
nt|ady: how many hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Traian, from Australia  has always been very good on sessions that I have watched.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Next to me is an operator from Denmark, doing Rama|pg||
nt|roswolf: only the 8 david|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S seems obvious|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6S will be difficult to bid after the preempt|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and then finding out he makes the contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 13 back looks like a match of big swings|pg||
nt|xenya: another slam for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is excellent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 46 imps in 5 boards   buckle up  it could be rocky set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3352 has option of opening 1@C or 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C includes 20-21 Bal|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lauria is upset ;(|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Lauria's great brain whired round for a minute or two and then told him 'Try the @SK!', who are we to disagree?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: unbeatable so break time|pg||
nt|brgpro: a slam hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  think this last one will loose|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h is supposedly 10-12, multi for weaker hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@h = 6@hs 10-12 hcp|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another interesting board. 6@C|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S   excellent|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gulyas: I can see the cards, too:) - but he may play for the @HA onside on, say, a trump lead|pg||
nt|pawel90: nam idzie 4@s - im 5@C|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: connection dropped out so maybe some data was wrong but the movie says 110|pg||
nt|famus: Hi Vincent --so it get made-good|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 4@SX-2 can be as well|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@c is strong 16+ (17 in balanced)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=22-24|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all - good "morning"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: upgrade looks right|pg||
nt|brgpro: we can say that easily here because we see all the hands|pg||
nt|brgpro: shd be esy to reach|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-21(22) HCP, maybe 5M|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Weinstein evaluates his hand too strong for 1NT opening due to good 5-card club suit and 2 aces.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H call shows 5 spades, 4 hearts, invite values if I remember|pg||
nt|brolucius: The US South did enter on the @CK-Q-J-x-x-x hand and they then pushed E/W to 5@S for a 13-IMP swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lost connection, up to speed now|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 4H with the right guess of S, but they lack the points to go that high|pg||
nt|lechcold: to nie bêdzie prze³omowe rozdanie chyba..|pg||
nt|psyck:  this looks like another mildly swingy board|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   can make 5@D     |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a save for n/s|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: interesting fight here this board|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@S from west, 3@H from north, and south will bid 4@S on the basis of the sixth spade|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so will end up in 3@H now|pg||
nt|fluffy: You're back jan?|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is board 23|pg||
nt|roswolf: many wouls punt it now as west|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w can make 3N here|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I see it, it does not depend on hos he reads the hearts. He can only drop the @CQ if West has two clubs. In that case East is favourite to hold the queen.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: consolidation tricks by italy:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: back in business... sorry|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|boedhy:  against 5@s doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: can make - but not bid 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so you were right Martin :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this has stolen the board|pg||
nt|gulyas: SD, not DD|pg||
nt|ady: likely heart game    12 tricks maybe without diamond lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 2@S in W - but Es sk still stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: or 6 possibly|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 2nt showing a good heart raise; same thing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fleisher could have transferred over DBL  but anemic 4@H wasn't attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: will he act now? and if yes, how?|pg||
nt|brgpro: Versace thought declarer had 5-5 for he didnt bid directly over 3 @h |pg||
nt|brgpro: so he played a trump back|pg||
nt|brgpro: he knew pd could control @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  Normall NS play 1NT as a good 12-15|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but 3rd and 4th hand, vulnerable, they play 14-15|pg||
nt|rhelle:  to avoid unwelcome penalty doubles|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have the cc on my second computer|pg||
nt|kit: N-S in other room did well to stop in 2@S making|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@S 4@H 4@S and ???|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@d is normally weak but can be strong|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@h looks like strong|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c might be like viking club 5-7 balanced=|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|gracelin: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he should raise, if only to block minor rebids|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay of diamond pips   |pg||
nt|bobh1: not on best defense|pg||
nt|xenya: but finding a 4-4 minor-suit fit is always a problem|pg||
nt|xenya: i can't see him sell out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6    2N-3@C[puppet stayman]//3@D-PASS   what a creative auction from Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  How much @c support does w's 3@s show?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=4@H and/or 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  with all the good tens and the @h king onsite he will make 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|jkotor: na 5@c co trzeba trafiæ|pg||
nt|famus: did*|pg||
nt|kit: Nice 2NT call by Martel -- that is a fine contract|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like to open the field for opp to bid - so 2@S from W from me every time (and pd know that its a weak support)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C good bid, showing the side suit to help partner judge over 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: west might hope for 2 trumps tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: S 6@S but very weak|pg||
nt|athene: and indeed that would give west the information to double|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seems much too heavy|pg||
nt|brolucius: East was nowhere NEAR a raise of 4@S, so West had to do more (not that it was really possible) to get there.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Brown couldn't even find the slam but still England gain 11 imps|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to our excellent VG operator for the bidding explanations. Roland told us that the operators have been practising for a while and they have certainly been very good.|pg||
nt|kit: Routine 4@S contract, will easily make 10 or 11 tricks, and almost sure to be same at other table.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so you are cheating|pg||
nt|psyck:  this could make a couple of o/t's or u/t's|pg||
nt|ady: 6 as A@H   and a trump trick to lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D is not the worst contract ever but doomed here|pg||
nt|ady: has|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, not inconceivable that NS will end up in 6@h - which is unfortunate due to the @h break|pg||
nt|athene: since he has a misfit in the minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Fleisher just asked that|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: @D lead again:)|pg||
nt|ady: diamond bid by Sementa stopped any chance of 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@H NF |pg||
nt|gulyas: sry for those who do not know the terms yet: SD: single dummy (like a declarer at the table)|pg||
nt|pawel90: po pikowym trzeba dojæ od razu impasem kier do stolu|pg||
nt|kit: 3@D will make also|pg||
nt|ady: really to much to bid more than 4@S   and east has little reason to proceed|pg||
nt|gracelin: agere, but that's what a preempt is for.  4S not enough, but 5S maybe dangerous.|pg||
nt|psyck: with flat hand & already having shown a good raise, W will reject the 2@s game try|pg||
nt|brgpro: why...W will never have !KQJ, so E must have 1 ( either the Q or the K) and KQ10xx in @H...with @cQ wouldnt he overcall 1@h?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's two-over-one forcing to game.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i know it is easier for us to say...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lall saying "I wouldn't be surprised if it showed some @C tolerance." Kamil responded saying "He said it showed a @C void" :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cruel game at times|pg||
nt|brolucius: A two-level suit response would be forcing to tame, so the upper limit for 1NT is higher than in traditional methods.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and some times pard bids @D's  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|oosmanb: 5@d looks like limit to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: S will realive with 4@S|pg||
nt|jfeld:  East has a lot of playing strength, but not many controls. well judged|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hope we get an explanation of the 2@C alert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks :)|pg||
nt|szalay: 800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one benefit of rolling 20-21 BAL into 2@C is that it is possible to play 2@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so a partial pick up by USA1|pg||
nt|gulyas: DD: double dummy, seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|famus: good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes 110 for east west is the correct score|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks if defence cash 3 clubs   otherwise 11|pg||

nt|fluffy: will probably do all the distribution here with a bid between 3@h and 3NT|pg||
nt|barnets: duboin might struggling in 4@SX o board 20|pg||
nt|barnets: that should read mighty struggle|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@h should go -1 if they attack the@d's soon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is plenty high enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so a modified Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|ady: still needs some bidding     doubletion heart the key|pg||

nt|fabsayc: just following the guidelines for commentators :)|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: it is not always easy to see what the players are writing to eachother on their small pieces of pater|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: paper |pg||
nt|xenya: are they on a relay route -- seems like it |pg||
nt|xenya: that might help|pg||
nt|rhelle: from (sometimes bitter) eperience, these relay sequences can be tricky - especially with distributions that occur infrequently|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry for disconnection...|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing missed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no, tx|pg||
nt|rhelle: although the explanation isn't quite what South has got, it did locate the @c fit|pg||
nt|xenya: so N knows S's shape -- should be 6 clubs now?|pg||
nt|athene: combination of sixth spade and the diamond strength...looks like 4@S to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I could just see the notes Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good eyes|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: or 2@C was @C + @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could have been @C and another   if Barel hadn't bid 2@S we'd know for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pachtmann did bid over the DBL   so playing 3@H north|pg||
nt|pelu: against best defense down 3|pg||

nt|idc: Ahha, West it was who took control with a 4@s RKCB|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H X could be easily 2 down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y with @DQ falling 4@S can be made|pg||
nt|hedyg:  if the double by E was a gameinvite i find it courageous|pg||
nt|ady: as lone as they shift to a heart before trumps played  just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: long|pg||

nt|garden2005: mo¿e sete ³ykniemy :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: ³ykniemy|pg||
nt|garden2005: +100|pg||
nt|psyck:  other room started with a strong @c & @h splinter...surprisingly neither pair found their wat to slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: decent game but unlucky|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 2 clubs  1 spade and a diamond  |pg||
nt|fluffy: whata nightmare to play something at trick 2 from hand|pg||
nt|ady: not that great Bob   K@H missing as well|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if one US team loses, Italy picks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the only time you can go past 2@D is with a strong hand i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3NT denies shortness|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: the cards are so well placed that almost can make 4@H|pg||
nt|brgpro: if he plays a @D now, S can jump in and play a @C back, then they can both receive a ruff|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: if south knows his partner's shape then 6@H looks clear, with the good suit texture, even not knowing of the @H10 opposite|pg||
nt|kareno: Still it is hard to posit such a perfect fit.|pg||
nt|athene: a pity - my guess is south found out distribution but didn't know he was facing so many prime cards|pg||
nt|kareno: I would guess Italy will find the slam in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: and he didn't have any way to make a mild slam try in hearts - if he had done so, north would surely have accepted|pg||
nt|barnets: a good pickup here for USA|pg||
nt|idc: Perhaps West could have tried 4@d instead, East cues 4@h, and they might stop in 5@c|pg||
nt|ady: well bid|pg||
nt|kit: Madala must have played ace of spades -- otherwise that doesn't make sense, and clear to play ace anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would respond 1NT if he were not a passed hand.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  So even if s hadn't cashed the ace Lall was likely to place the red aces properly.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many articles have been written about playing in a 4-3 (by the American writer, Jeff Rubens, for example). Some readers say 'I'm, not interested in that. I never play in a 4-3 ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: fit.'  |pg||
nt|brgpro: didnt look at W cards at all|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|boedhy:   http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for the runnning scores click on live scores bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still think much more system default or bidding mistake from Gower that they were not bidding it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  But Muller wil be thinking about this...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  sure - but as South you're still kicking yourself|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only one in 7@d on the board... Chili against Italy bog lead for them also|pg||
nt|yke:  some players might just open 1NT. But maybe they play 13-15 NT since they play precision?|pg||
nt|famus: 4S not alerted looks like rkc?|pg||
nt|pelu: but 2@S making, so even down 2 could be a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: just for comparison, in the USA2-Sweden match 68 imps have been exchanged over the first 7 boards|pg||
nt|xenya: 58 rather|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 1@C-1@H-2nt?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, lots of possibilities, but getting a strong balanced hand to play it is one of the most important goals|pg||
nt|ady: hand 22   4@S making here is flat   in spite of a diamond lead in OR     south switched to heart without cashing 2nd diamond|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch now very good for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i think he will play @H9 or @H9 now:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: north trying to ask questions about 1NT, if it can be 4144 for example|pg||
nt|gracelin: when West can be expected to hold no more than 2H, He is sure to have 4+ of clubs.'|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that either North or South held an obvious double.|pg||
nt|brgpro: so even if he guesses @S, it will go down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: 15+ - 18 1NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it was,|pg||
nt|nkgupt: will need to discard on second @d to make...apart from @h guess|pg||
nt|barnets: this is a great opportunity for Italy|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe 3 rounds daimonds beat this|pg||
nt|barnets: diamond and second diamond disc|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Gerben42:  5@S was "I have a problem in @D, bid 6 if you can solve it"|pg||
nt|eggy:  Are there still carry forwards from the round robin?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with @DA, W might have shown KC to have 7 as option|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Yes eggy|pg||
nt|xenya: not a single flat board so far|pg||
nt|brgpro: what about a direct ruff...|pg||
nt|bobholl: better @C|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes @c back will make their defense much easier|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, even a direct @H back...declarer will be forced|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, as Kit remarked, they have had to take a rather close view to reach game after their chosen start.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 15+ to me.  Maybe a 5 card major is a barrier for them.|pg||
nt|gracelin: bad lucks for China that HK is not on side.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that is 71-0 after 11|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  carryover is decided by the RR match between the teams|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Ok. So I believe Italy will get to choose which one of Netherlands, USA 2 and Israel/USA 1 it wants to play.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  22  where we saw 2@H+1  Upmark in 3N East|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: diamond lead will create problems with spades 4-2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact i dont see a way to make the hand|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, i've been in many, many worse slams than this one on a finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and 5@H 2 and queen of hearts|pg||
nt|ady: slam easier to get to via strong club|pg||
nt|bobh1: transportation issues|pg||
nt|ady: even gteat club play of the Queen   pickint up 3 club tricks may not be enough|pg||
nt|ady: great|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @C98 are mighty here|pg||
nt|ady: can still make 3 club tricks playing the queen   but difficult line |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  either + 1/2 the IMPs of the RR if the team that won the match was ranked higher, or -1/3 the IMPs if the team that won the match was ranked lower|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: so that unbid heart suit was the only making slam|pg||
nt|kit: well, maybe he didn't -- but it does seem clear play|pg||
nt|pelu: board 23 where some of us would bid 2@S i W -  Weinstein also Pass, and the NS won the contract in 3@C - making|pg||
nt|bobh1: S's last bid was close but I can see why he raised|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps anyway|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: @s 9 next|pg||
nt|ady: I doubt east will fall for that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads are 4th or 2nd from bad holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're right Vlad   just over 8 imps per board so far|pg||
nt|brgpro: so still -1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: with double finesse my @C98|pg||
nt|2celik1: 16:00 da cayne yi yenecekmisiz|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed, a good inference.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told 2 tables played slam on 23  -- but in the same match so no swings anywhere|pg||
pc|dK|nt|boedhy:  on board 6 I was right lot of peaple in 5@s even 4@s doubled...|pg||
nt|yke:  for me it is a 1NT opening. But that's just a matter of style|pg||
nt|gracelin: good play on route to 9 tricks.  Declarer can later duck a round of D, draw top trumps and pitch dummy's D on good H, then ruff a D.|pg||
nt|pelu: even with @HK onside there are hard work to make 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: same play if Hearts are 3-3, declarer can pitch one D on H to lose only 1S, 1D and 1C|pg||
nt|pelu: and 12 opp 11 - and bad @C-value is not game potentional in green|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer in 2S here needs to find way to encounter a possible 4-1 trumps break, thus the huddle.|pg||
nt|bobh1: languishing in 3@H is no bargain|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=881|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Weinstein led @D5|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: or better 3NT did not show shortness|pg||
nt|barnets: best was dec to pitch on second diamond but west continues a third diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: giving a ruff and disc|pg||
nt|nkgupt: dont think can make now|pg||
nt|barnets: what can dec do ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: down 4 or 5 here but against 4@H C not bad|pg||
pc|d3|nt|barnets: if he ruffs in dummy still has a heart and club to lose|pg||
nt|barnets: so best def always beats this against best dec play|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting to see if any e/w make this defence|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: the hand might still prove difficult|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is north has a better hand than he might have, but not really enough to take control|pg||
nt|kareno: Spades break.  Or third club can be ruffed with ten of hearts.|pg||
nt|athene: and he can't show his extras very easily in a lot of auctions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he knew that Declarer held 4/5@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr vg: but we are phantasizing kibs whilst never @CQ|pg||

pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: this table is also in time trouble|pg||
nt|ady: still 2-0 to China this srt    not the big swings of this morning|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is an amazingly low-scoring set after the spectacular fireworks of the previous set. (I missed them, watching England-Sweden in the women's QF and will go through the set ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: later in the VuGraph records).|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is very tight bridge of very good quality|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree|pg||
pc|dT|nt|famus: so he promoted his 6th @H to show Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ginossar wond @DK then immediately played 3 rounds of @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weinstein guessed to discard a @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so it seems Ginossar in better position than Kamil|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: still 9 tricks possible|pg||
nt|brgpro: S can always duck the first trump, and force declarer with his last @d|pg||

nt|brolucius: South had a choice of 2@H, 3@H and 2@S on the second. Maybe even 2NT. He was fortunate to find the game after choosing 2@S.|pg||
nt|athene: oh yes, i didn't mean in the play, i meant the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: now only 2 club tricks    but normal line of play|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @D9 pls|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: 9@C best now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky  @H6 isn't an entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's IF  4@H is bid     seems very low chance of that happening|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck:  There is a note in EW CC that " 4c is pre KC" maybe did not apply here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now Kamil will take losing @S finesse to go down|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ady: well done   does not want to get squeezed later|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: claim 9 ton|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: 5@H too high on a trump lead|pg||
nt|xenya: so 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: 91s  would have been good if east persists with  diamonds   can make on a reverse dummy  getting back with a spade|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: he won't finesse of course|pg||
pc|d6|nt|antoniz: bezpieczna rozgrywka|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c6|pg||

nt|jfeld:  it choses the match anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: play was very fast there after the @c lead :)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  unless both USA teams win, then its choice is nullified if Italy chose to play a US team|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: if it goes just something like 1@S 2@H [gf] 2@S 3@H, then north might find a 4@D cue or something to show a good hand for hearts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 11C=16+ unbal  18+ bal|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rhelle:  North has a monster hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Italians can win imps either by overbidding or underbidding.  You have to admire their judgment.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is why when you are in 2s you draw trumps and claim 3, so you dont do something stupid on the important boards|pg||
nt|ady: nothing nuch on here|pg||
nt|idc: So we have taken just 55 mins to play half the boards at this table, plenty of time left|pg||
nt|jaapfr: open room time problems are expected (only 3,5 boards played in 50 minutes)|pg||
nt|psyck:  they also play kickback, so 4@d would have been KC|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  exactly|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  except that 4th place isnt decided yet :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lost opportunity for a write-up :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if lall played spade queen he would have to shift to clubs to avoid a one suit endplay|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: sharp 4@S C here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Halfway through the penultimate set of the semi-final.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some would overcall 1nt here, but pass looks fine with that shape|pg||
nt|athene: west may double 2@D|pg||
nt|brgpro: easy 10 tricks in @s for NS and easy to reach|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and indeed Prooyen Verhees also bid it and even made a uptrick|pg||
nt|brolucius: The KR evaluator program seems to take a bizarre valuation of jacks. Roland quoted an example where Q-J doubleton was allocated only 0.75 points, compared with x-x. Seems much too ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little for me.|pg||
nt|athene: wait till they bid hearts, then double for takeout :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D shows H, as before|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I doubt Campos, Villas-Boa have ever gotten a slow play warning, much less a penalty!|pg||

nt|ady: 2 level high enough  |pg||

nt|athene: he is in the "pre-balancing" position, to some extent|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "you played 1@c -- how did you bid that" :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  Then they may choose Israel, if they can as that is their best carry forward|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if opps might make 4@H and 1 can play NV 3nt as opps with potential results C or -1 or -3 or -4 (one should be happy to play 3nt)|pg||
nt|ady: 1 imps to Italy on hand 20    an overtrick in 3NT    could be impotant|pg||

nt|brolucius: We see again (from West) that the cue-bid is used to show a sound raise - such an important part of modern bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@d = 0-8|pg||
nt|athene: that's the classic recipe for that south hand|pg||
nt|hedyg:  they started 10 minutes later|pg||
nt|famus: at present tying with Netherlands in 2nd spot|pg||
nt|oosmanb: thats a scary 2@H|pg||

nt|ady: dbl competive  showing a club suit and spade tolerance|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes this double is called "snapdragon"|pg||

nt|pelu: 2@h and 3@C sh make - but thats max|pg||

nt|twcho: The south player, Edgtton, is only 19 years old and is probably the youngest player in this event.|pg||
nt|athene: but it's just a takeout double really, no need for a special name, no matter how pretty|pg||
nt|brolucius: On that shape, North might raise the spades. But more important to show the point-count with 1NT.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they play 10-12 NT here, so 1NT rebid shows 13-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@h = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@c = 4333 with a 4-card minor|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: to Jacek wytlumaczyl 2@d jako kara i starszy|pg||
nt|ady: very sketch 4@H     4@S   cheap|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can make 4H barring a club lead and duck.  But likely EW will buy the hand in spade.|pg||
nt|gracelin: If East should accept will just the extra spade, then West should not invite.  Partnership problem.|pg||
nt|gracelin: with|pg||
nt|brolucius: Invite is OK, acceptance was more borderline.|pg||
nt|ady: cannot avoid 5 losers   so might not have been cheap if doubled|pg||
nt|gracelin: a popular method is to bid 2NT to show a good raise and leave room for manuver.  or to double then going back to 3S.|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S destined for -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now versace runs to hearts and north doubles |pg||
nt|athene: but south won't (shouldn't) stick this, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: cue 2@H, check for 44 spades, bid 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: even though it's nice to go for penalties at this vulnerability, you know opps surely have an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: so defending at the 1-level might well be wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think not.  His pass of 1@d doubled was likely influenced by the vulnerability.  As it is north was on the thin side of the double and might have eschewed the double of 1@h ...|pg||
nt|kareno: with such thin hearts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is not making|pg||
nt|pelu: some work for 9 tricks here, |pg||
nt|gracelin: and as usual, Bocchi judged correct;y to stop in 3C|pg||
nt|barnets: looks ok to me|pg||
nt|idc: E-W task here to stop in time, since 4@s is as high as you'd want to get|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Brasilian player as a rule tend to be very fast.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sad pics on the news, the south island of NZ is under flood waters|pg||
nt|ady: need to attack spades to beat this|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Yes very surprising how close it is|pg||
nt|jfeld:  in the Venice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N forcing|pg||
nt|gracelin: the direct 3H bid forces partner to either pass or bid game.  East think I have a full overcall and an extra spade.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lucky layout, 3nt actually had more changes |pg||
nt|fabsayc: take your aces boys and gain an imp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are we still here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala opened 3@C (making +150) on the deal where Brink had the @CQ in 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ...guess in 3NT.|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes, |pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: On this hand, East may have upgraded his hand to 18 points, with two tens that accompany other honours, and two 4-card suits.|pg||
nt|pelu: difficult lead for East|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but with Bocchi beind the wheel, I thk he can hold his loss to at most 4 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: looks though they are heading for game|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fast play --> fast dinner|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4 b 40 minutes then:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty|pg||

nt|jkotor: ale z Kysiem to Jac gra³, ¿e to 4@d i 5+stary|pg||
nt|kit: Same 3@C call as made at other table.  I don't understand it.  It seem like game very unlikely opposite mere 2@C rebid.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: so Italy leading|pg||
nt|brgpro: he had to play to drop Q offside as he knew they would be in 3NT here|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@D makes as 3@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  3@d = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s = 3-3-4-3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  as South promises at least 1 control (a king), the North hand is now looking pretty good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then 6@s is is a little better then 50% because you can guess the @d and on a @d or non @d lead you get info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had he opened 1NT, which I assume shows 15-17, West would doubtless have stayed low. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Changing the 10,8 to the q,j on the hand above yields 17.5 points, still low but more reasonable.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Weinstein didn't even search for a 5-3 spade fit.  He judged that with 3-3 in hearts and clubs it was very unlikely that spades would take 2 more tricks than notrump, ...|pg||
nt|kit: which would be needed for 4@S to significantly gain over 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point.|pg||
nt|yke:  3NT is questionable to me. with a 5-3 fit you should play in spades when the long spades is the weak hand and in NT when the long spades is the strong hand|pg||
nt|yke:  because you might not be able to enjoy the long spades because of the entries|pg||
nt|kit: with AQx of clubs, there is no entry problem to the long spades|pg||
nt|yke:  good point|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson had a lot of water and now he goes to the toilet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Amazing!  @ss are only 4-1 not 5-0.|pg||
nt|twcho: a trump lead will probably set the contract|pg||
nt|psyck:  KC is key card & kickback is bidding the suit above agreed suit as roman keycard blackwood...just don't ask me any more :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  this looks like a normal puppet stayman sequence|pg||
nt|ady: 7 tricks looks ok    need an 8th from somewhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fallenius could have tried 3rd seat 2@D as weak 2@H/@S opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: At matchpoints there would be more incentive to look for a 5-3 spade fit, since making 1 extra trick in spades is worth something.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: after laying down his cards|pg||
nt|psyck:  not so normal rather|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@d likely denying 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|psyck:  & 3@s puppet back to 3N maybe|pg||
nt|athene: a very good example here of how bad it is to hold three small in RHO's suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another contract that won't make|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@s can be made because of the @c10...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  ah! a variation :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s is a strong 1-suiter, |pg||
nt|gracelin: even with this lead, if declarer is to ruff spade, he might lose a 2nd trump trick.|pg||
nt|pelu: some cross-ruffing af 9 tricks now - even play for 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: so likely there are still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: def have no tricks|pg||
nt|ady: the lay out is friendlt|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 clubs one spade|pg||
nt|barnets: one heart or 1 diamond should make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D is a close call 5 to 7 tricks for S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: with @D 3-1 this cant make on any defence|pg||
nt|athene: south's @Sxxx is a "death holding"|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  btw there were years that those 3 teams were the 3 medalists *g|pg||
nt|jfeld:  all 3 of those teams were heavy favorites pre-touranment to qualify|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  one of them will be out|pg||
nt|xenya: normal 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: probably a quick 1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no    it will be a slow down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: oh, W might lead a spade...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might  but i think @DQ |pg||
nt|xenya: if a spade lead, it will be slow for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great stop|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rhelle:  although why North wants to play a @s contract himself is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well South africa has bid it and made it|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in other room|pg||
nt|xenya: i would never open as S 3rd in hand, no matter what|pg||
nt|eggy:  Indonesia were perhaps a surprise package, but they have been very consistent.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Vlad leads better than I do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college  systems were devised to have me on opening lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rhelle:  4@c is a cue|pg||
nt|twcho: now declarer may succeed by ruffing three rounds of @s in dummy|pg||
nt|famus: -1|pg||
nt|athene: you frequently are going to lose the first three tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4-fit|pg||
nt|psyck: same defense after all...|pg||
nt|psyck: should not take long now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might play heart to ace now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|idc: With the preempt, declarer not likely to take 2 club finesses through South, and also likely to get trumps right|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: or the short version http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|athene: with the lead coming through partner's king or queen|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: It would be poor bidding for South to rebid his spades, but many club players do. Nowadays, partner might have a singleton spade, let alone a doubleton.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: not easy. 8 tricks there and work for the 9th.|pg||
nt|xenya: and, if i were told to open at gunpoint, it would be 1@H (prompted by a kibitzer)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you take @S or @C finesse?|pg||
nt|gracelin: West has a 9-loser square hand.  probably 2S is enough, and that's what EW can make even if East has a 6-card suit with 10 nice pts.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|boedhy:  now...... sign of or low @d lead...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ai ... North may pass 4@s now|pg||
nt|lechcold: nietrafnie Grzegorz|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect declarer will play to ruff fourth spade if necessary|pg||
nt|jfeld:  easy to tab between all 3 events on Bridge Winners|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rhelle:  I still think North would have done better to keep relay'ing|pg||
nt|brolucius: West at the other table did try to cash two spades against 5@S doubled and allowed the game to be made. |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one down against 4@S making in the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart five in north could possibly have been promoted to a trick with persistence in diamonds after cashing clubs.  The play is complex|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: very quick @H9|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking that if he doesn't overtake this and cash the @DK for a spade pitch, the defence can draw trumps and cash two spades|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case the nine was a poor choice because it opens him to the promotion.|pg||
nt|athene: but the trick comes back for the defence with a trump promotion in diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, he is always losing out one way or another - even if he didn't waste the nine, the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|athene: for example on a diamond if he can ruff high north can pitch a club and get a club ruff with the @H5|pg||
nt|idc: West won't be expecting a doubleton heart on his left, which might be the surprise that dooms this contract|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Particularly when s shows up with @h length.|pg||
nt|kit: Not much can happen here -- 5 unavoidable losers.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo @S better.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brgpro: now @sAK and @s|pg||

nt|barnets: a heart may be ok|pg||
nt|barnets: dec cant set up either long suit|pg||
nt|barnets: and enjoy the long cards|pg||
nt|barnets: eg playing@SA spade dec can make|pg||
nt|barnets: by setting up daimonds|pg||
nt|barnets: so the def wont do that|pg||
nt|barnets: were south to play a trump west plays the king and north will duck it|pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart back dec needs 6 trump tricks to go with his 4 side winners|pg||
nt|brgpro: probably better than playing on @H although both work|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but, let's be honest, it's a marginal slam. Around 50%, so staying out of it is no shame|pg||
nt|pelu: @C9 8 7 6 are strong ruffs|pg||
nt|gracelin: east has doubled 1C, so he doesn't have a singleton HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now ruffing finesse in spade is the safe route|pg||
nt|gracelin: if instead, going to dummy with HQ and play another trump, West can win CK and play D to force declare losing control.|pg||
nt|barnets: with 4 tens and 3 nines though :)|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice intermediate spot cards|pg||

pc|hA|nt|brolucius: 5@C doubled, I mean.|pg||
nt|ady: this a good save   4@H  makes   even on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that was safety play against 4-0 trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: Brink sees no chance of shedding his heart loser, so he ducks the first heart just in case the lack of communications will hinder the defence later. |pg||
nt|sybarra: must speak louder Jack|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck:  OK, 3@d just denied 5 card major for them & 3@s showed 4 card @h|pg||

nt|barnets: ruffs a @d with @SJ|pg||
nt|barnets: ruffs another club and rufs @D with the @SQ|pg||
nt|barnets: what does north do /|pg||
nt|barnets: if he does not overuff he can ruff a third club in dummy and be home|pg||
nt|barnets: so north has to overruff and play a trump|pg||
nt|barnets: andec makes 3 more tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: i think he makes it|pg||
nt|barnets: but wont guarantee it|pg||

pc|s9|nt|vugraphznt: toilet break now|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H on hand 23 where n/s had a save in 4@S  almost flat   overtrick in OR|pg||
nt|athene: he can only lead spades once from dummy after ruffing |pg||

nt|ady: 4@S looks good for n/s|pg||
nt|barnets: not playing any trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: A fundamental truth of bridge is that the duller the contract is, the longer it takes to play.|pg||

nt|athene: the double of 1nt here is takeout of diamonds, of course|pg||

nt|ahollan1: fleisher will take low road now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now we see the other side of the coin - a pre-emptive raise on a weak hand.|pg||
nt|brgpro: can work both ways|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2@c here...is nat for a change|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think only 5 @C |pg||
nt|brolucius: They will be happy enough to bid and make game, I imagine.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 5 is the limit i think...even that is difficult with @D that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: the splits are all bad |pg||
nt|sybarra: but for the @C which are 2/2 |pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C was reached in the USA match, I hear. (No idea whether one pair or two).|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes but u need to ruff 3 major losers|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was one down.|pg||
mb|p!|nt|vugraphznt: Nice tool, 3@D by lauria would be very good overcall in @S, perhaps more|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: RDBL = 3@ss|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: 3@H max, 4315 4 controls|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, more reasn to do so here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rhelle:  1NT = relay|pg||
nt|brolucius: East perhaps hopes to be able to redbi 3@D, to show that hand.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: given their light openings getting the chance to play 1@S may be an advantage|pg||
nt|twcho: east may probe for slam while west will reject at every opportunity|pg||
nt|gulyas: he was vul, thats all he neeeded:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East: @D fit,  and then 0@C ah|pg||
nt|pelu: 13 IMP comming up to USA - Sweden only 4@S in OR in B26|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: australia ranking 8th and china 10th so a very vital RR match|pg||
nt|jfeld:  The Netherlands has gained some ground on USA 1 and is now firmly in second over USA 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S could be 3-fit but usually 4|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3H is timid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even 4@H would not have shut out that giant North hand.|pg||
nt|ady: 10  tricks in diamonds    declarer cannot enter the south hand for the losing spade finesse to doubleton queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 4 is too high, i will stick to classical|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bid by Levin-Weinstein. Other room has not played it yet.|pg||
nt|brgpro: oh yes, u can discard one on @dAK|pg||
nt|brgpro: 11 tricks in @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: raise in tempo Brink, if you are going to |pg||
nt|sybarra: he may bid 4 @H "on the way" |pg||
nt|brgpro: 7 trumps plus 2 tricks in each red suit|pg||
nt|rhelle: You start with 7 trump tricks (2-2), 2@h (marked finesse) and 2@d. After that, it gets difficult|pg||
nt|brgpro: with @d 4-3, 6 is cold...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@C, rather than 3@C, interesting choice. |pg||
nt|brgpro: after the 1@h overcall, u can treat ur @hAQ as AK|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  I'm not sure I agree with 5@D here|pg||
nt|psyck:  similar start here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: questions and thinking bij w|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 4@C is 5 controls|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's hard for the underdog to play their normal game at such tense situation.  I am sure Lian will 4H everytime when he holds such hand at home.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: besides i dont want to eliminate 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@c = @c|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: N: "He is conservative, he uses to have at least 5 cards"|pg||
nt|psyck: Me too, if it was a 74 shape, I would choose 4@d instead|pg||
nt|engsetter:  hello kath as incisive as ever|pg||
nt|brgpro: Brink is considering pd might have, say 1-2-6-4, then 6 is cold|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D cue |pg||
nt|sybarra: or kickback?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lauria did well to pass, realising that he is facing a passed partner who did not open with a weak two.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Duboin now in 6@C in the Open Room, I am told.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: Gawrys, zapytany czy 2@s forsowalo, odpowiedzial ze nie|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: he says sorry and sigh's   but with a little smile :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and here NS will hope for a win on this board - for sure not losing 11 IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: talking about system|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might have led a singleton spade, so J-9-x-x with East was not so likely.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: claimed 6,  agreed making 7 afterwards|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if they are running into time trouble.|pg||
nt|hlortz: dull bring back the goulash hands :)|pg||
nt|ady: north opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South never counts tricks, he thought down 3, they said, same as Bocchi.. :) he said if you start dbling i will start paying attention|pg||
nt|ady: could have played 1 top clu though and then returned with a diamond to then ake a view 2nd round|pg||
nt|jkotor: Generalnie to w rozdaniu 10 5@d na 8 atutach i 21 PC nie jest szczytem marzeñ jeli przeciwnicy potrafi¹ wistowaæ|pg||
nt|ady: another quiet hand|pg||
nt|ady: may be push|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Sweden -NZ only on board 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decimal points come from carryover of Round Robin head-to-head match|pg||
nt|roswolf: italy probably ahead now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 1 hr and 15 minutes played in which they completed 11 boards. The alotted time per board is 8.5 minutes and five minutes grace time|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: No doubt declarer exited in clubs, in case West had to win (and then play a diamond or give a ruff-and-discard). |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes he had a winkle|pg||
nt|famus: yeh that wud b my line|pg||
nt|fabsayc: stansby could have returned a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 4@S C but NS can go higher:)??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1@D as earlier|pg||
nt|brgpro: unlucky that 4@h goes down here|pg||
nt|brgpro: 1NT=4OM and 5 card minor|pg||
nt|engsetter:  will 4S make here?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: 3@D better than double on that shape.|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.|pg||
nt|idc: We heard a comment at the table earlier that 'spades are always 5-0', so I guess this 4-1 counts as a favourable break|pg||
nt|ady: maybe part score in diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: might go 5@CX-2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: this 20-20 board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein also gives partner @C ruff to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if he hadn't done that   they would have beat 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently only 2 imps now|pg||
nt|barnets: time running out here for china|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm east warping a bit - no doubr feels the need to create a swing|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT shows 4-5 hand in spades/minor. I forget the name of the convention.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Raptor|pg||
nt|brolucius: Raptor.|pg||
nt|brgpro: polish NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Ergo this is more like screen speedball :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H 5-9 points.|pg||
nt|sybarra: S with best hand at the table.....|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2@h=weak hand 5@s 4+@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: ...with 5-6 spades and 4-5 hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i double versace passed 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt :)|pg||
nt|rensph:  W might be tempted to bid a thin game here, but it's NV so might very well pass this|pg||
nt|lechcold: szlemik w trefle teraz?|pg||
nt|gracelin: we may see a Gazzilli action ere|pg||
nt|barnets: and swing he will have if n/s pass|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|santyclz: So much for 3nt by n...|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C a little scary -- Weinstein thinks opponents might have a slam.|pg||
nt|pelu: but a problem for NS that they never found their 5-3 fit in @c|pg||
nt|lechcold: transfer na kolor wroga to Stayman|pg||
nt|ady: light opening from west|pg||
nt|hlortz: his was more tactical than technical imo he decided if he lost a @C right away def would be harder|pg||
nt|bobh1: can make a game|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N is 12-14, possibly bad 15, if i remember|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: you are correct.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but of course  no reason to expect @SKJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is soooooo close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  can be 5/4 either way|pg||
nt|roswolf: the rabbits will run soon|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky 1n x|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E explains: "Our drury style is very aggressive|pg||
nt|brgpro: a polish name i believe|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Just what n wanted to bid.|pg||
nt|brgpro: the Italian way...1m-2@s=5@s 4@h inv.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but many would just bid 3nt rather than use stayman|pg||
nt|ady: that makes the diamond part score awkward for n/s|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Hopefully they get to finish|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the implication is 2@H is a junk raise|pg||
nt|psyck: right, it would be constructive with normal drury|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: re after 2 days of very heavy rains Spanish Internet even less stable than normally:(|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|santyclz2:  And onside too!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: as they were in bd. 9 ;)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: an excellent spot that may earn some imps|pg||

nt|jfeld:  China losing to South Africa and has slipped down to 9th by a half VP!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and as you can see VERY CLOSE race|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you just look at NS hands|pg||
nt|gracelin: but it will end at 2S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players would open a strong 1NT on the North cards.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south can now bid 2D to show 8+ but he only has 7|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer still?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if 4@H down 1 not to avoid|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can expect his partner to hold a singleton diamonds after this start. He surely will not bid (?)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Kamil alerted 5@C but I did not see Fleisher alert it|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks it would seem in hearts|pg||

nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Israeli pair has found the @S fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can you explain South's options over 2@C, Patrick?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you double with the NOrth hand Dave?|pg||
nt|engsetter:  I regret I pass|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|engsetter:  too many doubles with balanced hands and worse when points in their suit|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|idc: if it asks for short suits, that 3@c will encourage him|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA to idealny kontrakt w tym rozdaniu..4@H mo¿na przegraæ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically  1@D-1@H//2@H = 4-fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont like the doubleton @C for doubling|pg||
nt|ady: Bochi in 4@SX    where 3 spades was 2 down here    cruel hand   and a hamer blow for Italy|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 5@D was a sensible option by North. Some would bid 5@C, claiming that they couldn't be any better for a passed hand. But South only made a simple overcall.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The VuGraph records are saved in various repositories (one is Nikos Sarantakos's VuGraph Project), so we can look up how other teams bid and made 7@H.|pg||
nt|ady: was worn out by then|pg||
nt|idc: But then if that is a return short suit try, South will be discouraged|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E thinks|pg||
nt|garden2005: podzia³y s¹ @d 3-3 @c 3-2 ... szczyt marzeñ|pg||
nt|kamyk: a 3@C to pewnie 5-4 w m³odych i 9-11; niektórzy u¿ywaj¹ tu 2@H na tak¹ rêkê, ale to bardzo podstepne i wirogenne:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: ano racja Grzesiu, choæ piki dziel¹ siê nieszczególnie|pg||
nt|jfeld:  not a good time for either of those teams to get a time penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we have 50 minutes left of the match|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so no timepressure here|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Hurd elects not to compete|pg||
nt|pelu: @s-lead and @d10 back to defeat 4@h|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|rensph:  Creative approach by W - had east shown a 5card major he'd be ok with that, too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this contract is touch and go, good guess in diamonds may see it home|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, am told 3@c is forced relay, then opener makes short suit try|pg||
nt|ady: may get too high|pg||
nt|famus: 6@s does come home --i think|pg||
nt|psyck:  other room has finished early, maybe Lall will login now to take a look at his teammates progress :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S asking W...|pg||
nt|ady: hand 26  a good swing for Chin   they are playing 2@CX   and made a game in this room|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: agree with all S passing?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 1@D-1@S//2@S can [rare] be 3-fit|pg||
nt|gracelin: so he can only return to 2S to show below 8, north will surely pass|pg||
nt|brgpro: brink knows there are 2 @s losers|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid by sjoert and bas|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 2/2 clubs again  but is that enough?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Beautifully bid by N/S.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink asks Versace No Double ? loool|pg||
nt|rhelle: extremely well done, to reach a good 5@c after that bidding start|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: They may end up in 2S with the Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|antoniz: dzielni ruszyL|pg||
nt|lechcold: kara mog³yby dzieliæ siê gorzej (drugi walet, drugi-czwarty król przed dam¹), wa¿ne by trefle by³y 3-2|pg||
nt|jkotor: E ma ekstremum w ramach 9-11 A, A, K i 10ka na podpórkê|pg||
nt|jkotor: lepsza karta to tylko 55 z tymi samymi honorami|pg||
nt|xenya: he might double now, with the idea of converting 2@H to 2@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: low scoring match and China leading so far.|pg||
nt|eggy:  I don't think that's particularly underbid it though|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 5 teams within 4.5 VPs|pg||
nt|brolucius: What would 2@H mean? Natural and fewer than 8?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: zero leads|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but it would need 5+ hearts.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a swing likely but perhaps not to china|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: what a great 3nt which needs @S lead to beat|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The bad news for n-s is that w is on lead. |pg||
nt|engsetter:  I prefer doubleton club to doubleton diamond less space to wriggle if in trouble|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|kit: He could be a lot better as a passed hand.  Stiff in a major.  Queen of clubs someplace else.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|gracelin: All othe bids by south will show the strong hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is one disadvantage of the Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this time he has a very healthy 5-card suit.  North is worry south ma bid the same way with a much weak 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel knows declarer doesn't have A10x of hearts or first trick wouldn't have been ducked, so continuing hearts is safe.|pg||
nt|kit: And he had to lead low, since Stansby might have started with ace-doubleton.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not if you're this NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Ginossar tries 3N      Weinstein waits to see if that ends the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N it is  and quick @HK lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should mean USA1 plus in both rooms|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Gazzilli south needs to bid 2D with all 8+, a GF facing the strong hand (2C is 16+ or natural)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no top losers here  but 6@S may prove difficult with 4-1 split   |pg||
nt|ritong: he briefly considered a @s J switch|pg||
nt|kit: no need for that, since if Stansby has king of spades the jack of spades shift can come later.|pg||
nt|jkotor: Gawry nie mo¿e wymyliæ A@s u partnera, a bez tej karty szlemik zawsze bêdzie s³aby|pg||
nt|ady: still got the diamond fit|pg||
nt|xenya: but preferred a cautious pass, being vulnerable|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|fabsayc: ?|pg||
nt|jkotor: seniorzy taryfa w plecy na Duñczyków, tylko panie dobrze w tej rundzie|pg||
nt|antoniz: to mo¿e wtedy od razu 2karo?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@CX may not make   but great against 620|pg||
nt|bobholl: luckily @C are 22|pg||
nt|brgpro: after a free 4@c from pd? S shd be thinking about slam had he had 3 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: my limited understanding of gazilli says that 2@c is either nat or 16-18, 2@d is 8+ any, and 2@s shows spades and clubs minimum|pg||
nt|gracelin: sout may pass 1NT with 12-13 pts in order not to be involved in the Gazzilli.  But with 14 he fears losing game if north has 10-11, even a passed hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby declines the game-try but 4@c leaves North a different problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we should be back now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: there has been some technical problems in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N goes down a lot if Ginossar doesn't run @D before losing @S hook|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 41H HAD 0 CHANGE SO AM I ALLOWED TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT 3NT HERE:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: Sorry caps|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is 3NT any better than 4@H?|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@H is way better|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H is one of two finesses (although the club finesse is almost certainly wrong).|pg||
nt|brgpro: in 3NT u choose to finesse @c or @d( assuming @s4-3), but 4@H u can try both|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: technically right|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: so you expect W to bid 4@H:)?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jaapfr: oeffff|pg||
nt|ritong: thus he sticked on @hs|pg||
nt|antoniz: wtedy AK karo i K trefl,te¿ niele|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @s are nice and friendly. will probably lose 1@C and 2@D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: double dummy can make 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike standard -- Grue able to bid 3 times since 1@D opening was already limited to 15 HCP|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a wonderful effort that deserves to pick up a few IMPs.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: N does command @C lead i assume|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@h is worse than 3NT only when N leads a small @d from Kx, then u have a tough time|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this strange looking play is quite good|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: for running scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: saving spade king for a late discard|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As long as the x isn't takeout.|pg||
nt|idc: His dbl looks sensible|pg||
nt|famus: ya-4-@s stops it and a top @C ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the reason is 3451 is the lesser evil|pg||
nt|barnets: well 2@S is down1|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d bid looks risky with E an unlimited hand, but once opps have found a fit, it is less riskier|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 60-60  can it be tighter?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ok -100|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: the reason why south bid 2@c instead of passing 1NT is that he might be facing an 11 point balanced hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: you are quite right.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think they can get out for less than 2hearts and eventually 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West showed 6-8 with red suits|pg||
nt|kamyk: W ma wprawdzie minimum, ale dobre honory - mo¿e móg³ jeszcze zanêciæ przez 4@S?|pg||
nt|pelu: also @DQ work|pg||
nt|yo_yo: They probably did well to stay out of 4@S with the bad split|pg||
nt|brolucius: Other table is in 5@D I am told. Levin/Weinstein had exactly the same auction as here.|pg||
nt|rhelle: I hear the other table is in 5@d !!|pg||
nt|brgpro: 5@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: ty but then E 3@H not 4@H Gerbrand?|pg||
nt|jkotor: AK@d i K@c to potrzeba dzia³ki atutów i ¿eby pik sta³ jak kara gorzej ni¿ 33|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and we lost connection|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: that lead made it easier|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 10, instead 4@S Netherlands played 2@S and earned very important 9 imps.|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is quite annoying because S has to take @S finesse before cashing all diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now defense can't go wrong   @SK doesn't offer useful discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're right Vlad -- entries to hand are gone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even in standard i like the grue sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3415 yes   not sure about 3451  that hand maybe rebids 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 5 for Italy on hand 8   alout to play 3@C   against 5@C down 1  when Italy went to 4@H this table|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rensph:  N missed a chance to give partner 2 ruffs there, now it looks like 3@D is making|pg||
nt|hedyg:  surely a direct 3@d over 2@H would have been gf and this was a slight invite|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: SHI a bit SHY:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I have entered the results from this room now|pg||
nt|xenya: on a heart lead, yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done to cash out|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: second push in a row on 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget that  3415 = 2@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Martin is right|pg||
nt|pelu: so from -500 to +100|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is down more!?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fluffy: but normally 2@s is with 4 clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW play a very natural system and use standard sugnals|pg||
nt|gracelin: signals|pg||
nt|xenya: no longer, Rashed -- The Netherlands gained 9 imps on 10 when they stopped in 2@S and made 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: bith 2H and 2S show less than 8, but are natural.|pg||
nt|engsetter:  well I am sure it makes double dummy and the english team have been strong on card play|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kareno: I use two-way stayman and with game values, I do always check.  That my hand is balanced (4333) doesn't mean partner's is also the same, particularly with the modern tendency to ...|pg||
nt|kareno: open a lot of 5/4 hands 1nt.|pg||
nt|gracelin: so Italy maybe forging ahead after the disastrous set.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a big improvement on standard bidding in that area. All the more necessary when 2-over-1 systems widen the range for the 1NT response.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but even 2S is in jeopardy here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1NT is best and if north had opened 1NT they would be there.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Without such as Gazzilli, you are more or less forced to open 1NT with 5-3-3-2 shape and a 5-card major. |pg||
nt|gracelin: while the China Open team won 50 imps last set, the Chinese Ladies team lost the same 50 mps to France.|pg||
nt|ady: could be a few imps for China here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C Gazilli  includes no min with 3@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oosmanb: but not straightfoward|pg||
nt|oosmanb: could perhaps insure contract by giving an open @S since he's missing entries to hand|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: So the auction, say, 1nt - 2@d (gfs) - 2@s - 3@s offers a choice of contract.|pg||
nt|rensph:  declarer will have to choose between finessing in clubs or spades|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like the logic behind SOuth's lead: partner has short hearts so where are E-W tricks coming from except ruffs, so lead a trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now kamil cant both lead diamonds and hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: That (excellent) lead simplifies it.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gracelin: Yes, if their north player does open 1NT at the other room.|pg||
nt|ady: so a mixed mood lunch time in Chinese camp|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, the guys are laughing and the girls are weeping.|pg||
nt|brolucius: They would not order 'number 50' on the Chinese menu.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat ironically|pg||
nt|brolucius: So I hear. No double.|pg||
nt|bobholl: than holland is completely back :) hurrah|pg||
nt|brgpro: that will be -2 and another 13 for Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think|pg||
pc|d7|nt|boedhy:  this is close|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, one or two good decisions required|pg||
nt|boedhy:  needs to play @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and as Muller is playing it will take some time|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then he will play @d offcourse|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed- if only to get information how to play @ss|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has nervous moments -- feels a lot better with king of hearts onside|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rensph:  ...unless defense solves this problem for him|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: was commanded|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: the D shift deceived declarer, playing D strength with E|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, as Papi says:  "You need a reason *not* to lead trumps".|pg||
nt|idc: At the vulnerability East wanted to suggest a 5@c sac to his partner, hence the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|idc: If any blame is to be awarded, West's dbl perhaps deserves it (though -300 instead of -140 no disaster)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: that's possibly the first time in my life I've predicted Duboin's line of play|pg||

nt|ady: hand 9 flat  4@S -2   200    similar auction  Sementa  declarer|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: Now will strip out hearts and clubs, and then try to duck a spade to West|pg||
nt|antoniz: zagrali poprawne 5tr|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: By eliminating the side suits, he can survive when East holds @SQ-x.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Sementa decided his hand was worth game in @H, covered the black losers, nice @H fit and Kx in @d look pretty good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: waiting to see who wins or match|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gracelin: instead of taking 2 D tricks, Madala takes none by this defense.  He is not headed for -2|pg||
nt|idc: USA avoided the slam on failing finesse on Bd 8, so their lead up to 21 IMPs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gracelin: no matter how hard Bocchi struggles, he is booked for -1|pg||
nt|brgpro: he knows N has only 1@d|pg||

nt|cuan: favoritissimi, senza Nickell, ed era vero. Basta guardare il Round Robin dove non c'è stata gara. Abbiamo preso dei fuori campo pazzeschi per coppie del nostro livello, ed abbiamo ...|pg||

nt|athene: after 1@S - 1NT, how many clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: i bet he bids just two|pg||
nt|famus: in 6 i think he might well lead a @S|pg||
nt|psyck:  since 4@c often has other meanings, many would open 5@c here|pg||
nt|xenya: so Ginnosar in the other room decided not to take the @S hook, quietly going 1 off|pg||
nt|ady: yes   some might have gone down 2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 2 imps Dutch likely though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: susan stockdale made 3NT on 26, i didnt forsee that|pg||
nt|brgpro: so we have a new leader!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: new leader :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Remember. Bob, that commentators must completely unbiassed. (Just as I am when I watch England... ahem...). |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: We are back live again|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|rhelle:  2@c = 11-15, 6+@c|pg||
nt|xenya: Ginossar rather|pg||
nt|gracelin: good hand for China as they open 15+ to 18 1NT.  Will East consider his hand 18+?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so more imps for england|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: NS do play 1@S - 2@D as hears|pg||
nt|rensph:  other table reached 3N and made it, so 7 imps to South Africa|pg||
nt|hlortz: that will beat it --i think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not stopping under 4@S now I think|pg||
nt|jfeld:  important to discuss your follow ups after your side makes a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|jfeld:  a simple agreement is that if the opponents run, the first double is takeout and subsequent doubles are penalty|pg||
nt|eggy:  Einarsson (holding my average rubber bridge hand) no doubt hoping that East doesn't get carried away with a good hand|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and that you are in a force through 2@D or 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Sweden vs. New Zeeland has played 8 boards so far|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they have 45 minutes left to play the last 8 boards|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Einarsson here, hoping to escape|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is Wooldridge thinking here|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 4@H-1 (not doubled) looks standard|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Not quite strong enough for a mini-splinter.|pg||
mb|r!|nt|boedhy:  south will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|athene: hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Two - no need to preempt with a solid opening bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China has another chance here, 6S is cold|pg||
nt|fluffy: not your everyday vulnerable preempt|pg||
nt|fluffy: 6@s is far from cold requiers a good guess i ntrumps or in the minors|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Italy they say Vulnerability is for children and Bocchi is no children.|pg||
nt|fluffy: normally you should gues trumps, but you are not entry rich to dummy|pg||
nt|psyck:  they did have 4@c available after all|pg||
nt|psyck:  cc says " Wide ranging preempt"|pg||
nt|psyck:  I would expect W to pass|pg||
nt|psyck:  with @s's & @d's breaking, 4@s could make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks far too easy to predict 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: this looks a part score hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: no offense meant sorry SHI|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ lead    @D to Ace    @C finessed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+  could be 4@D and longer @C/@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: but they won't use the bid with this hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  W bids 4@d before n can.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 1's to Aus with a flat inbetween each|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   have around 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|famus: probly xfer to NT|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks like the stopping place for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks  unless A@D les against spades|pg||
nt|brgpro: wow, this overcall works beautifully here|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 4@S-1 good save against 4@H though|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, maybe not|pg||
nt|nkgupt: XX= 4@h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H  but not 6+ weak hand|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rhelle:  2NT = balanced|pg||
nt|kit: This is as flat a 4@H hand as you will find, it sppears.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and denies 4@S since o neg dbl perhaps|pg||
nt|eggy:  North will think there is a source of tricks now|pg||
nt|eggy:  or not!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very strange choice of lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a)  not leading major   b) leading from Jxxx  UGH|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is really @d4..|pg||
nt|gracelin: he did. now China is going to bid to their H game and face the bad breaks.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think so too|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I once made a weak jump on 7 to AK in diamonds, quite proud of it until my '@h'Q turned out to be a missorted diamond|pg||
nt|idc: a weak jump on AKQxxxxx was consider over-sound by my peers|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  q10xxx in the midnight swiss...|pg||
nt|hlortz: /no/|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@d is precision style so can be few cards|pg||
nt|fluffy: to a minimum of 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul  1N=15-17|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may reach 4@H      not the easiest contract|pg||
nt|brgpro: @c ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S overcall (if made by a lesser player) would merit a shake of the head.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Who can say that this is not a great match?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am not SOOOO SORRY|pg||
nt|sybarra: since he is "uncle jack" the n/s,  I think he is permitted |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C could be 5/4 either way|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fluffy: aat least with the club opening he will guess clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Shi didnt dare to cue 4@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess Lian will move on|pg||
nt|pelu: but Lian still looking for slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he had taken a bid but took it back|pg||
nt|idc: and 'weak-jump' became my nickname for a while (till I did something even worse)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 6@d = 500|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this doesnt look right|pg||
nt|ady: cant get there now|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@D |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W better bid @d|pg||
nt|fluffy: Cullin should normally bid 1NT 11-13 with this hand, probably he did and its wooldridge who i thinking about entering the bidding with 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not vul =14-16|pg||
nt|yo_yo: EW can make 4@H  actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  (no singleton or void)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  so Einarsson chose his "best" suit|pg||
nt|jfeld:  this could work out quite poorly|pg||
nt|eggy:  It could indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this is not for people with weak hearts |pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@s is -2|pg||
nt|brgpro: no big deal|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Responsive x showing the black suits.  The fact that he holds the best hand at the table is a coincidence.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wow... one level contract|pg||
nt|brgpro: Lauria and Versace are my friends too but i lived in Holland for 6 years...|pg||
nt|sybarra: David will go make Tea?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  6@S makes on the rather fortunate heart position here, but they'll likely end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty harold|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: even 4@SX-2 which is indeed very likely still deserves 3 imps|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am glad no-one asked me why East had bid 1@S.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: had a fine sequence with 7654|pg||
nt|brgpro: he is only 1 card away from a straight flush, |pg||
nt|brgpro: that might be the reason?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is only one or two cards away from a 1@S overcall.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: van prroien is the pokerplayer|pg||
nt|brgpro: in fact, declarer can win in hand and play a @c to the A then a @s|pg||
nt|brgpro: can end up with 11|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5@C too |pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  2227 balanced tehese days :)|pg||
nt|athene: wow, only 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to bid a few more than that after partner doubles clubs for takeout|pg||
nt|idc: That's a good auction|pg||
nt|idc: Particularly by North, appreciating power of his shape after partner's negative dbl|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now what?  6 of a major looks likely  on the bidding (if not the hands).|pg||
nt|ady: south will have to find 3 discards on the clubs|pg||
nt|ady: best to take the 1st heart   but a difficult play|pg||
nt|famus: can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: oh my -- big chance for USA1 here|pg||
nt|kit: The North hand sure doesn't look like notrump to me.|pg||
nt|ritong: passing 3NT is a surprise, yes|pg||
nt|eggy:  Hurd knows spades are better|pg||
nt|eggy:  so takes the money (he hopes)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW vary their range   1/2/3nv = 14-16   3vul/4 = 15-17|pg||
nt|gracelin: if East had opened 1NT, West will surely pass in a makeable contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: they should punt the slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: too quick with pass me...|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 4@h must be shi|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Grue cuts Lall a *lot* of slack for light overcalls.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Upon tabling dummy he said "I put a lot of trust in Mike Kamil's bidding. Am I right?"|pg||
nt|brolucius: People wrongly assume that I am biassed during England matches. Just because I have an England flag around my shoulders. Ridiculous.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: this should be down, even down two is possible|pg||
nt|kit: however, important for Martel not to squander 10 of hearts at trick 1!|pg||
nt|psyck:  gr8 guess by Joel, I have to admid i would not have found the 5@c bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: he might punt 7|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|brgpro: but he is trying to figur out if that is safe or necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: After dummy was down for half a minute, Kamil said "Down two?"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table just finished 25   Italy 4@SX -300  for another 5 imps to Dutch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: missed a pass Karen|pg||
nt|kit: and ace asks for count or unblock I believe.  |pg||
nt|lechcold: muszê siê oddaliæ, i chyba dobrze bo moje kibicowanie szczêcia naszym nie przynosi...do zobaczenia jutro|pg||
nt|ady: and still 11|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: only reason is that if not now mentioned @S it is unlikely they ever find a @S fit imho (although it would never cross my mind to bid 1@S myself)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|boedhy:  well maybe south should go for 3nt then ?|pg||
nt|ady: Madal quiet on this hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5@C tricks 5@H tricks & 1@S trick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both finesses right  but impossible to bid|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sort of wrongsided it now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could it be slam looking form south...|pg||
nt|kareno: I also play that double as takeout.  And they have a light opening style with the forcing club system.|pg||
nt|rensph:  wouldn't want to get anywhere near 6@S usually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best now is spade shift|pg||
nt|kit: he got it right!|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C - 2@D - 2@H lloks like invit with 5-4 in major|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chasing the vulnerable game that does not exist|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 MAJOR ACES TO LOSE -NEXT|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT opening with a singleton a bit more fashionable these days   I prefer not|pg||
nt|jfeld:  the only problem with passing is partner might be there to the rescue...|pg||
nt|jfeld:  but obviously that is unexpected|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W laughs when he saw the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and so did Hurd and Wooldridge|pg||
nt|brgpro: at least he has shape|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: in OR in 5@H here|pg||
nt|brgpro: without knowing the missing @d are 2-2, 4@s can easily be a huge number|pg||
nt|brgpro: 5@h is makable unless @h lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had shown his hand with the 3@H bid, so he could sit back after that. No question that he would bid 4@S.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and what is the chance he leads @HA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: USA 1 took a big lead when China went down in 4@S rather than the 3nt on bd 25.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You remember the deal where Levin upgraded a 17-count to 18, reaching 3NT opposite 7? China played that deal in 4@S, on a 5-3 fit and went one down. So, Kit's advice on the deal, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that West should not seek a 5-3 spade fit proved to be good advice.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they are there, I am quite sure Shi will take 12 tricks.  He is the best player in the team and reach semi final in BB in 2009.|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby's dbl started as minimum but I guess even his hand feels a little improved on auction|pg||
nt|idc: the 6@d bid should warn declarer of bad breaks ahead|pg||
nt|idc: I admit I might be tempted to do less as South - perhaps dbl is a little pesimistic but a forcing pass of 6@d maybe best|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: how to play now? not over yet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  now is there some way to endplay w with the @h loser and force a @s lead?  I don't see one,  but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist.|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, I suspect this won't make - need a 12th trick from another @d ruff or a spade|pg||
nt|idc: and this attack on dummy's trumps probably too hard to handle|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Martel reading a book|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "Starbound " that is|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3@C+1 likely|pg||
nt|eggy:  Not sure once you have decided to bid 3C that you should then bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good duck from Barel  holds declarer to 2@D tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: must be, but very strange, yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 aces  great intermediates  = 15 :)|pg||
nt|ady: bit top heavy   18 and 2 tens for 1NT opening|pg||
nt|barnets: well bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: at the match score and with all the controls angreat trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: no stays at 6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fluffy: if declarer missguesses trumps he will need to find @dQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: or squeeze south in the reds|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a difficult task|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S = 2Aces + @SQ - Lian exp @sAKQ :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he even has time to establish a long Heart|pg||
nt|famus: natural for him to play !j--but if he opts to play a small @s--the play ends at trick 2|pg||
nt|famus: @sj|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the vugraph schedule so you can plan your days and weeks      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|pelu: he know that N is short in @S, so he could play @S6|pg||
nt|famus: that wud end the thrill!!:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has so many entry to dummy, so I thk to take CA and play small spade to finesse S10 is the right play|pg||
nt|fluffy: Imaine for example playing a low spade and south ducking @sK9xx he might lock you in dummy with a heart and you have no way back to hand except destoying you chances of stablishing ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: this will be the 3. slam-swing in the match - the first 2 gave China 25 IMP and prob 12 more here|pg||
nt|gracelin: China should be proud of themself in outbidding the Italians in 3 slams in one set.  If Shi makes this.|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby will probably shift to club, although anything but king of hearts works fine now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: It is in fact Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: many play 1x - 1y - 1NT now 2@D = GF, 2!x realy to 2@d and direct major weak|pg||
nt|roswolf: if it is now working!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: good safe 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 25 China mad 2@CX for a +180  and 13 imps to China|pg||
nt|ady: not sure how west found this fit   couold not east have been 5-3-3-2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: interesting bidding and wp by SHI b25|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: sorry b26|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chinese fighting to the end|pg||
nt|barnets: he will eventually cash @DA and lead one up to the Q later|pg||
nt|barnets: playing diamonds for 1 loser|pg||
nt|brgpro: what...|pg||
nt|brgpro: why the J i wonder...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: but one of the slam only maded on a defensiv error|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes sorry:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time he finds the 5 card major|pg||
nt|fluffy: wow that's a strong view from a passed hand!|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has described his hand accurately. If he rebid 3@H instead, West would not have much of a picture (were he to be stronger, with slam intentions).|pg||
nt|gracelin: they do open 1NT on 18, but the 3 10's swayed Shi to upgrade to 19.|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 3 tens|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C made it easier for West to respond on some weakish hand with a major suit.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: various ways to come to nine tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: take a ruffing finesse in spades is one|pg||
nt|ritong: despite the superfavorable @s layout|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 11, China played at 6@S making 7 and lost 11 imps.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|boedhy:  offcourse it was 50% but south has a very strong hand imo|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi must be thinking harder than we do except he is not looking at all 4 hands.  I am sure the line he chooses is the best one.|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the page for the result fromthe 3 events     http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|famus: so the Chinese wud b the first to put a dent in this Italian Juggernaut--They've rolled over evry other opponent mercilessly, and i dare say artfully till now|pg||
nt|barnets: italy bid to 3@S where we saw china open 1n with AKQ10xx in spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kamyk: jak nie idzie, to nie idzie - nawet tu stracimy impa|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think guessing spades declarer will lose 1@c, 1@s and a heart ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: there might be some problems with the scores entered -- WE WILL FIX IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to the lead   when lead from Jxxx gives up a trick, you rarely get it back   but lead from @HK even if it loses a trick, you often get it back|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: indeed he did not|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hlortz: yes with both k and j diamonds with south i dont see how to make it|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, guessing spades he can keep hurd off lead and make it|pg||
nt|fluffy: draw trumps guessing clubs and run @sQ brings teh contract, but this is double dummy, what will declarer do?|pg||
nt|fluffy: he must worry about clubs 4-0 to start with, he might be thinking about 1000|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rensph:  pointed out to me that it's not 12 tricks if E leads a club through, so S would have to play the hand in order to succeed. :)|pg||
nt|idc: I still admire the auction (by both sides) up till 6@d, then perhaps South did a little too much|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer will go up with the ace|pg||
nt|twcho: but he has to choose from finessing in @c or establishing the 4th @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make if he does not touch trumps early|pg||
nt|xenya: even with @H 5-0 it's an easy make|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: another room and another SHI|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: down 3, and 14 badly needed IMPs for USA1|pg||
nt|ady: apparantly 2NT was alerted as showing 4 plus clubs  so there must be another way of inviting game with 5 spades and not 4 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: maybe 1NT 2@c // 2@d 2@s shows 5@s inv|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: mb even 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now bidding the slam hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jaapfr vg: are we viewing the right cards played?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kareno: And all he needs are eight :)|pg||
nt|ady: now down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer losing a trump and 2 aces|pg||
nt|eggy:  East has a plan ! :)|pg||
nt|jfeld:  down 1 and a push|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|idc: but perhaps we should put it down to good E-W sac causing tough problem|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As was suspected, Brasil got to 6@h on  board 10.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South found out 3@C is making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and that 4@s is not making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is to the bathroom|pg||
nt|ady: south cannot afford to discard a spade as 5 clubs and a sspade can be cashed  and south then end played with a heart|pg||
nt|roswolf: it isnt i am told!!:(|pg||
nt|brgpro: Italy needs to bid 6@H to have any chance...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: now overruff, diamond shift kills the dummy entry|pg||
nt|gracelin: now he need to guess DQ for his slam.  Declarer may try Heart 3-3 first,|pg||
nt|pelu: did he realy need to play @SJ?|pg||
nt|famus: so he has to play on the red suit squeeze but i think must surrender a @S NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: I say no, since he as so many reentries to dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: :(|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N was a good alternative of course|pg||
nt|rnmalik: timely K @D. S needs to ruff a @D on table for the 10th trick.|pg||
nt|ady: China in a great position to challenge for a qualifying spot  if they keep their lead in this match|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: sure|pg||
nt|resurectin:  Still here, yes i believe 2nt is invitational with clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: china now ahead 0.5 VP over Australia|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: were 10th and australia 8th and first 8 do qualify for QF after round 21|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but Japan and Sweden also only 2.5 and 3.5 VP away|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: so only 8|pg||
nt|ritong: hi ck hi all|pg||
nt|fluffy: as long as he doesn't touch spades, defence should prevail|pg||
nt|fluffy: he must know that he cannot score any further heart ruff since declarer will ruff with @cQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: so drawing trumps looks promising, diamonds won't provide more than 1 trick for declarer and he will have to play spades himself|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As Jordon pointed out on the audio, a lot of Grue's values are soft, he's balanced and doesn't have a lot of aces.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|twcho: nice smooth duck by south in the 1st trick|pg||
nt|twcho: now the contract is doomed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Nigel is a classy young player with a great future'|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer is not thinking much of his luck, so far.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: oh yes N is thinking @SA is surely with E (another advantage of the 1@S bid David:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|psyck:  Salut Henri|pg||
nt|xenya: excellent explanation, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 in a row!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|famus: to keep trump control and check out @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: take @S10 and play @DJ - he has a ruffing finess later in @c|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is to eatablish his club trick first|pg||
nt|pelu: my bet: he will make :)|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@c was indeed a fine anticipation|pg||
nt|ritong: and the best way to push opps to guessing|pg||
nt|ritong: other choices, like 4@h hoping to play there or pass, hoping that lho will make an error are way less clever, imho|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: The bidding is not as we see it, obviously. Our VG operator is valiantly trying to recover from the crash (which is not fault of his). |pg||
pc|cT|nt|fluffy: now best declarer can do is 1 down|pg||
nt|fluffy: if south tries some fancy pitches from @hA he might even finnish on 2 down|pg||
nt|fluffy: because he will have to ruff @h8 with 1 trump|pg||
nt|fluffy: and then do something with @sQ108 opposite ONLY ONE TRUMP|pg||
nt|fluffy: even chinese finese in spades leaves him with 1 down|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|gracelin: H to dummy, run CQ, covered, ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: without playing next card south claimes...|pg||
nt|fluffy: if succesful|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|antoniz: przeciwko dru¿ynie z Izraela nie idzie od wielu lat|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: very very close|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobholl: bas suspects offcourse good @H in west|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: hsnd 10 China mad 1NT go gain 5   down1 here shen we tht should be down 2|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south overruff and play Heart, dummy wns, cash CJ, and ruff Heart back, the last trump will double squeeze NS|pg||
nt|fokal: true|pg||
nt|gracelin: and south cannot discard H here.  Best for im is to discard a D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: hm|pg||
nt|idc: I would ignore the 11 IMPs credited to Brasil on Bd 11|pg||
nt|twcho: Looking at his age, a mere 19 years old teenager, amazing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Madala upgraded his hand to 18-19 Bal|pg||
nt|ady: and even then would be hard pushed to maked up 23 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opened 2@C [their version of Romex 2@D]|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: Madala did just that.|pg||
nt|fokal: E can't afford to play a trump now|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs offered my free cofeee if making - I look forward - he will make!|pg||
nt|fokal: since he doesn't know what to discard from dummy|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: sorry Nabil I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Versace called the director again, something about the double|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: If it showed @D or support for @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it lets Brink interfere|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: b26 also 6@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  26  Madala  4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2 slam swings to Netherlands this set|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|gracelin: -2 with the ruff.  declarer will not misguess spade since south cannot have a singleton quack.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fluffy: chance of 2 down here|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fokal: double squeeze still working if s ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: preparing diamond 2|pg||
nt|gracelin: now if south overruff the same double squeeze works.  |pg||
nt|fokal: if S discard a @d : @h ruff, @d to the K @h ruff|pg||
nt|fokal: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes.  Great hand|pg||
nt|fokal: indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: if S discard @d2 - then decl can take !KL ruff a @H and lst trick to @s9|pg||
nt|pelu: @dK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|fluffy: he can play spade double finese|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 1@D contract and a 1@H contract in the same set? Does not sound like world-level bridge, but it can happen.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: so final usa2-holland most likely|pg||
pc|h9|nt|famus: By now SHI like any world class declarer knows the hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: tries to break the squeeze|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @D8|pg||
nt|ady: Dubion defence was unusally off beat|pg||

nt|fabsayc: hey my half hearted prediction came true|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: actually this was the bidding :)|pg||
nt|idc: Auction entered is 4 passes and I doubt that really happened, just a typing glitch i expect|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re los kabeltje:)|pg||
nt|famus: had he taken the first @H --had a possibilty in !endplaying S|pg||
nt|ady: was a difficult hand to make  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: he would have done better to lead low spade on third round|pg||
nt|ady: but survived|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: last board was 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China LEADS Italy by 12.3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: routine board, although might have been a slam with perfect club fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: nice 4@H EW here|pg||
nt|brgpro: but what is the reason to play @cJ...|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Jordan, excuse me...|pg||
nt|engsetter:  another slam|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think it has been decided|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Netherlands played in 2 invitational events recently in China   winning 1  2nd in the other|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so they've definitely been in good form|pg||
nt|brgpro: they beat us 25-4...Fu and me with 2 Johnneys( Including Hurd)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: south doubles 1@S and then north bids 1nt, i suppose|pg||
nt|gracelin: I have predicted Shi will make this slam.  Glad he didn't let me down.|pg||
nt|famus: shud read him for 7@hs with that Vul|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: www.bridgewinners.com   has interview by steve weinstein of  sjoert brink|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: back to the double figure swings|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a z kim nam tu sz³o?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: but @CQ mb was better|pg||
nt|fluffy: the only line that had chances of making as chudecek suggested is to run @sQ and pray for @sKJx onside, with @s7xx begind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 1 suit,  @H/@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and de wijs-muller were extremely impressing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  so far NS have 12 plus scores - they will be happy|pg||
nt|gracelin: at this Vul. 2D shows 4S and 5+ minor with 5-11 pts|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2c was 18-19 , madala passed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, 2@C shows 18-19 balanced for them. The other Italian pairs use 2@D for that.|pg||
nt|pelu: me me thats absolut minimum for a Michaels 2@c -|pg||
nt|hlortz: true. it was a difficult hand to play. i expected trump leads w/qj09|pg||
nt|ritong: here lall/grue had a shooting auction, "helped" by a 2@h opening in east|pg||
nt|ady: double fit in reds   4@H makes e/w|pg||
nt|brolucius: As it happens, West might have passed a rebid of 3@H. Opposite 2NT he was happy to try 3NT. With 6 points opposite 19.|pg||
nt|brgpro: Johnys|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ady: Sementa losts of clubs and spades again|pg||
nt|hedyg:  1@c= 2+|pg||
nt|pelu: but @H 10 9 make the hand better|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: safer|pg||
nt|ady: but 4@S cheap for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Yes, Bd 11 still being played in other room, in 3NT by East (USA)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that was 4117 almost same|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Raptor is only played in direct seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is unbalanced now he dbled|pg||
nt|ady: this time they do have a spade fit   but still might play more safely in clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see what happens with a quieter start|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@h fit jump|pg||
nt|ritong: hurd certainly would prefer chunkier suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H on heart queen being right|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27   China in 5@C X   need to play carefully to down 2   -300|pg||
nt|fluffy: when you go 3 down in a vulnerable slam and win 12 oh hell yo ufeel much better after checking scores!|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5D/5H also make|pg||
nt|ady: e/w will never be allowed to play 4@H   |pg||
nt|brgpro: even if E tries with 3@d|pg||
nt|brgpro: it is hard for W to accept|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C natural, remember.|pg||
nt|brgpro: the higher NS pre-e in @s, the more likely EW will bid slam in @c or @h|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @S is best imo|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@s is probably the best choice...|pg||
nt|ady: the sort of hand Netherland will like    |pg||
mb|2H|nt|barnets: quel systeme !|pg||
nt|ritong: his action has the merit to place his hand immediately|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, should be better @h suit normally...|pg||
nt|ritong: he will not participate further if unsollicited|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play in game|pg||
nt|oosmanb: right|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only the middle cards in diamonds make 4@H playable.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: only if @H 2-2 and @HT an entry (@CJ fine)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has very few losers and will surely drive to slam opposite a double at that level, albeit by a passed hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this upgrade may get them to the good slam, 2@S followed by 4@C splinter|pg||
nt|twcho: I still can't understand why declarer take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: Meanwhile: New Zealand doing well against USA1 (23-7VP), Sweden-USA2 almost even, Singapore vs Australia -- same  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S a playable level.|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27 looks around 5 imps to Australia|pg||
nt|barnets: i think that was a tired play by east|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H is a much better shot|pg||
nt|barnets: not cashing the @DA first|pg||
nt|roswolf: but may have scored a goal|pg||
nt|imp_jan: automatic 4s|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes...but that is still -5...1100|pg||
nt|brgpro: it is hard not to bid 4@s with this hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: some might be tempted to double this with north but he does not have that great a hand|pg||
nt|athene: you either need a shortage so you can get some ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: just a X to help opponents :) - he has shown @h+@s why D - extra values?? NO|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we have 12 minutes left -- and still 2 boards left after this one|pg||
nt|fluffy: ok it seems 2@d shows a multi 1 major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue DBL would be takeout|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 2@S is invite for hearts or signoff for spades|pg||
nt|ady: yes  5 level also ok for e.w|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  yes they will be pretty confident about there list|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only board 9 is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  It was bid and made at most tables|pg||
nt|athene: or you need such good trumps you just make them by force|pg||
nt|kareno: Nanev very close to a second double.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't know you were bi-lingual.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Because he was tricked by a 19 year old?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  after the accident on board 4 he is hesitant to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C no chance|pg||
nt|ady: now Sementa has said it all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Thundering here, South; I made a wrong bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: ciê¿ki rebid z rêk¹ E...|pg||
nt|antoniz: ³adna odzywka Piotra|pg||
nt|ritong: so we land in the 8 cards fit, relatively low level |pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry, 4@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: chances for -3 there in 5@C?|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@d is tell me your major|pg||
nt|fluffy: and 2NT can be whatever|pg||
nt|gracelin: West is inconsistent.  He bid 1NT intended to jump to 3 to show a limited raise.  But after 2S he just showed his D and concealed the  fit|pg||
nt|ady: some judgement required here both sides|pg||
nt|fabsayc: modern auction, not particularly succesful but a pass of 1@D might also be wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E has a hand which he thought was too good for a 14-16 NT opener|pg||
nt|brolucius: One more club, surely.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but cant e/w make 6 clubs?|pg||
nt|brgpro: i agree that pass is better after seeing all hands. but who would pass in this auction?|pg||
nt|bobholl: sjoert has told his story or is west thinking ?|pg||
nt|brgpro: just put urself in the S seat u might even do worse...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: alfredo thinking now|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@S unthinkable. It must be West thinking.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: brink passed already|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bids are entered as a pair, from one side of the bridge-screen, on our computer-screen.|pg||
nt|brgpro: his @c aren't looking good but once pd removes his X, shd have great cards in @c, other than that he has no more weakness|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: well done...excellent remark|pg||
nt|brolucius: East shows good values by bidding rather than defending.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: good explanation David thx|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am confident that West will bid 6@C (but I remember I have been wrong - once or twice - in the past).|pg||
nt|brgpro: but, cant pd have, say...-- Jxxx Qxxx K (or A) xxxx?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: in fact all 3 pairs are|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tarzan|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention that 2@C on a passed hand should show a sound raise in partner's major was banned for years by the English Bridge Union.  They thought it allowed players to psyche ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in 3rd seat....|pg||
nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
nt|athene: he really has not got that much defence|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case, north might sit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  for those who want to see the open room on livestream: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|ritong: looks healthy|pg||
nt|psyck:  this should also go down for a more or less push board|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT is apparently billed as natural on the China convention card. But that makes the rest of the auction a mystery for E/W.|pg||
nt|gracelin: sorry,  from the bidding it's obvious West's 1NT over the double already showed H fit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a sharp double here?|pg||
nt|gracelin: you cannot learn these stuff from their CC, only the bidding will tell the true story.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Their card says 'Redouble 0+ HCP, penalty seeking 1X-(DBL) - any = Nat,NF.'|pg||
nt|brolucius: 9+ not 0+|pg||
nt|ady: neither east nor west could hardly double 4@S with amy confidence|pg||
nt|brolucius: Super fit for both sides.|pg||
nt|gracelin: But if West figure East to be short in spade, he could try 5=level hoping to find partner with AK, A.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sensible bidding.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@h can be reached only if E bids it himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is no doubt what he is thinking about.|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@d showed 18-19 balanced & heart suport|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 tricks either spades or clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg:  in 4@s you would have to ruff high and play the J@S to create an entry to dummy with the 10@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|ady: this looks tough to make|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they did well to stop there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some don't use that treatment Martin -- either @S or to play in a minor|pg||
nt|ady: quite lucky on the auction for e/w that 4 red trricks stand up in defence|pg||
nt|engsetter:  4H for anyone rather then 4 spades?|pg||
nt|ady: Q@S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rensph:  only worry of declarer here is to avoid losing 2 spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: with the knowledge of south's 4-cad spade, declarer can take deep finesse there to get 4S, 1H, 2C and 2D.|pg||
nt|ady: Duboin in with his jack   but partner had shown a good hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am afraid that even is not enough hedy|pg||
nt|roswolf: my link does work if you get NO SEVICE press F5 on your computer:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: but regardless of what it was Hurd is going to compete|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2nt shows 6+@d|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 2@S 8 or 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lechcold: na drugim stole pad³o 2@H i jest grane|pg||
nt|ritong: yes trumps are cruel|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: awful board to defend this 1@S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphznt: 5@h= 2 aces no @sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see it is 14-16, so not an upgrade, and to me worth 4@D over 4@C since diamonds good for many discards|pg||
nt|hedyg:  extremely disciplined pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: instead of dbl direct 2@S is 6-4/5 less strong|pg||
nt|xenya: not an easy hand|pg||
nt|barnets: most matches decided now holland lead usa 1 women by 16 imps with 4 boards left|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well done, indeed. Another splendid auction for us to watch.|pg||
nt|rhelle: out of this world bridge|pg||
nt|brgpro: grand slam is out of the picture for sure, he was thinking to bid 6 or pass|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein worried about a club ruff, so may play two top spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 37 IMP for China on 3 slams !|pg||
nt|gracelin: as there are only 2 entries to dummy, he could cash SA first to see what's north singleton, when the S7 shown, he know to double hook S10 and SQ|pg||
nt|fokal: he can evan afford to cash the @s As|pg||
nt|famus: this shud b a swing back to Italy if @s dont go to deep fin|pg||
nt|fokal: *even|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E-w appear to have 4 losers and stopped just in time.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  on the other hand he also knows that with double fit Duboin is big enough to bid 4@s if it is there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think he will just claim|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: a bit late with time|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes keep refreshing the website, it'll work |pg||
nt|gracelin: good judgment and get a bonus if south doubles|pg||
nt|ady: I dount 9   may not be 8|pg||
nt|ady: doubt|pg||
nt|brgpro: as long as declarer knocks out @hA first ( the entry to the 3rd trump) he can make it|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: can in fact go down 1|pg||
nt|ady: will need to play a heart which has to be ducked    then a diamond|pg||
nt|brgpro: once he knocks out @hA, he can always ruff a @d in dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fluffy: in 4@s, 4 players made, 10 players went down|pg||
nt|fluffy: making 3NT is for sure a supperb score|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Italian declarer must be among the 4 that make|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer lacks the entries for finesse south for Q107x, so he must hope north hold one of the Q, 10, or 7.  So cas SA and take the double hook|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer can fleely cash @sA now right?|pg||
nt|famus: has to beware of entries to play @s twice- but also needs to check the hand---Declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|lechcold: po kierowym ataku konieczny by³by impas i damy i ósemki pik|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: alternatively, try http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|bobh1: does E know that all these @S cue-bids were "bluhmers"?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: but then declarer mb not best line|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: looks 1 down|pg||
nt|ady: clubs being 4-1|pg||
nt|xenya: but now EW can score a @D ruff|pg||
nt|ady: ruffed with long trumps|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: we had trump AKQJ and 22 hcp and could not beat 1@S:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i pass 2@D to play in that minor :)|pg||
nt|ady: bad for Italy|pg||
nt|roswolf: might have more now|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's double is known as a 'competitive double'. It suggests a doubleton in partner's suit and values in the unbid suits.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: If he plays trumps from the top and they break 3-2, he can set up the clubs, leeaving the master @SQ out. |pg||
nt|andyv:  and for current standings: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|idc: Fortunately for Brasil, @dK offside otherwise 4@h makeable|pg||
nt|hlortz: looks like 11|pg||
nt|brolucius: These competitive auctions always make great viewing when the contestants are world-class. Excellent.|pg||
nt|ady: one would think with south hand  double risky    nothing in red suits to defend|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed david|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: I HEAR dUTCH IN 4@h|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I think the play in @ds (since there is a side entry) is to play the k first to guard against a 5-0 break.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: 2 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|bobh1: otherwise he might fear duplication|pg||
nt|ady: hand 27 was down 2 in 5@C X  5 back to Australia|pg||
nt|fluffy: what is wooldridge-hurd's NT rang?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ginossar rebid 3@C   i like Kamil's choice more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: potential protection of @SQ  and doesn't overstate strength of hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should have waited   now told  China 67-3 for the set  leads Italy by 27|pg||
nt|barnets: I am advised 29 with3 boards left|pg||
nt|barnets: this is a big turnaround in last set|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: You can see how hopeless it would have been for North to 'cover an honour with an honour'. |pg||
nt|santyclz: The bad news is the trump break.  The good news is that s didn't request a @d through.|pg||
nt|kamyk: pechowe rozdanie - N mia³ prawo liczyc na dubla karo u partnera|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this might be a fast board|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think I can remember from previous boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed |pg||
nt|ady: still a trick short though with clubs badly placed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobh1: i guess he knew|pg||
nt|xenya: so declarer would have done better to play trumps at once|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: Diamond needed|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate sing. club is the 10|pg||
nt|bobh1: both slams depend on the @H Q and 32 @Hs|pg||
nt|ady: this could be a swing for Poland|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i even do not see DD how to beat 1@S|pg||
nt|fluffy: nice this explains why Hurd was not very optimistic on the bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: both USA womens teams were favoured to do well|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: perhaps they were influenced by the need to do something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: laying down club king earlier would have simplified this defense|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: last chance for NS|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: yes, nicely done, now two entries to dummy for the double finesse.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: was not clear though|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it was australia playing the 5@c, so 5 imps to china|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: Now diamond shift and he is down.|pg||
nt|kit: Problem was he couldn't go up ace of hearts due to no entry to the club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South may hope that North started with @CKQJ.|pg||
nt|bobh1: to get back in the match|pg||
nt|ady: well 13 imps wasted|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bidding 6@C didnt seem to be in the picture for a long time during the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but no semis for them|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: If North had that in clubs, North would have cashed another club at least|pg||
nt|antoniz: dlatego wist karo jest niedobry,moim zdaniem|pg||
nt|engsetter:  surely not planning for Q10x??|pg||
nt|brgpro: he can ruff a @d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Yes, that's a good inference - one that South has missed.|pg||
nt|kit: But South failed to work it out, and a lost opportunity goes by|pg||

nt|fabsayc: open room bid the 50% slam on board 13|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: They are picking declarer clean.|pg||
nt|famus: this was a wrong move by Madala--now dec home|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: when a pair are looking for 3Nt a D often just help them - some players even have an agreament: D = dont lead my suit|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: nothing|pg||
nt|ady: duck the first heart may set a problem?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it would david|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be a confidence building result for the young USA team- who have played well|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rensph:  11 tricks now, as at the other table|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: NS agree you make 4@S when you are in it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to spy on other tables without login  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Holding mighty Italy to 9 IMPs is quite a feat.|pg||
nt|fluffy: a good partscore and 6 IMPs back to USA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more 16 board sessions today to finish Quarter Finals|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: still some work to do -- i mean the @D suit|pg||

nt|ady: should get this right as cannont make with hearts 3 in south hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: fantastic duck|pg||
nt|ady: but under pressure may go wrong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: may be because of the preempt was placing @CK with W.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|c3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rhelle: on the previous hand, NS were in 1NT. Eventually declarer played for the @DQ with he long @d, going 2 off|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table, South has bid only 3@S and West has just doubled.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: just made|pg||
nt|ady: defence may get end played    needs club now|pg||
nt|brgpro: W does best to cash winning @s exit a @d but then he can ruff and play a @c to the J, E will be end played|pg||
nt|ady: after J@S|pg||
nt|ady: not exit diamond   that takes east exit out|pg||
nt|brgpro: but if W plays a @c, declarer can guess to play low from dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: all lines do lead to make this imo|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: Upside down carding by n/s.  Note the small diamond on the ace, encouraging, and now the high heart, discouraging in that suit.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lechcold: ;0|pg||

nt|lechcold: by³o sporo s³abej gry, ale szczêcie nie sta³o po naszej stronie..|pg||
nt|jkotor: tiaa, ale jeli dojd¹ do tego negatywne emocje to ju¿ mo¿e nie byæ dobrej gry dalej|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Antoni - ty zawsze by³e starowiecki...kompletnie nie rozumiesz ducha wspó³czesnej walki...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a make for n/s|pg||
nt|xenya: S happy to pass -- W now?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok is 7-10 raise|pg||
nt|psyck: BROMAD style bid i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: now some 70% 4@H with W @DT and if no T only 37,5% chance to make 4@H (value of @DT was some 32%:) |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: to thin to be bid:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 6@S i meant|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont know...maybe 30-40%|pg||
nt|brgpro: 6NT can be made here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this will be a classic semifinal for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@C final contract in the other room on previous board.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: ojojoj|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt is no doubt a 4 card spade raise, alternative was some flower bid in hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: should i tell the players?|pg||
nt|pelu: @s @H squeeze against S|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks available here for e/w   can they do it again|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ill back them, moneys on slam|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 6@H    as can ruff out spade suit when 4-2|pg||
nt|oosmanb: haha for those watching Open room webcast|pg||
nt|roswolf: this slam is of rolanf proportions!:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Versace was toying with his final pass card over 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: i think thats how they do it|pg||
nt|barnets: to make sure 2 different countries are in the final|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont know exactly|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 39 unchallenged imps for Dutch is a mountain too high for Italy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 1/2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could be  1444|pg||
mb|2H|nt|twcho: redouble is a better bid than a mere 2@h bid in OR|pg||
nt|psyck:  I would have expected a 1N opening by N here|pg||
nt|ritong: holding south hand, you know that this rates to be painful|pg||
nt|ritong: a strong NT, you mean?|pg||
nt|ritong: ow|pg||
nt|ritong: very painful, even|pg||
nt|psyck:  1N=(13)14-16 for them|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand  but easy for n/s to get overboard  after light take-out double by north|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: did not see gosney alert 2@h, but edggton did|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   did not see 1@S opening |pg||
nt|ady: not light double   sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are no books that tell you what to bid with East hand after partner shows @S and unknown minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or how to scientifically bid 8-card suits      but i digress|pg||
nt|brolucius: You like them thin, then?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  It's pointed out to me that Fleisher only needed 4 @d tricks so if they were 5-0 offside cashing the a or q first would allow a finesse for 4 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: not sure about the meaning of double|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I could not see explanation, sorry|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H plays well here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they corrected to 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: ok back to earth now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: signalling he really doesnt want to pass|pg||
nt|ady: but a slam here may be flat|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but EW in 4@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in 30|pg||
nt|xenya: the one thing you shouldn't do as S is bid 3N on this auction|pg||
nt|xenya: PASS or DOUBLE (if greedy)|pg||
nt|psyck: Bergen Raise Over MAjor Double|pg||
nt|psyck: distinguishes 3/4 card fit & point ranges|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: a zacz¹³em pisaæ, ¿e kolejne p³askie rozdanie:(|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Raising your partner!  Is that legal?|pg||
nt|hlortz: wasted no time getting there lol|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant tell them that!!!|pg||
nt|ritong: phew|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: think SHI passes though|pg||
nt|xenya: good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: @H-lead against 4@S, then @D to K, @S to A @hQ to K and ruff, @CA and @C .. to K @hJ disc @C-loser, and so on = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: heee  24-44 China (lucky or deserved:)?|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 3H, so 2S -1 or -2 is no big deal|pg||
nt|idc: Looking at the E-W heart intermediates on last hand, you might just hope for 2-2 trump split rather than a partial cross-ruff|pg||
nt|famus: he needs to ruff a @D for a push board i think|pg||
nt|ady: absolutely|pg||
nt|xenya: despite the grand slam swing we still have the lowest score as compared to the other matches|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good stop and 8 tricks are, may make 9.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: "there|pg||
nt|brgpro: @s2-2 is not enough|pg||
nt|hantveit: 52,5%|pg||
nt|brgpro: Lauria feels he has to do something now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: 2NT   strong break of transfer|pg||
nt|kit: operator -- this is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|kit: Normal 4@H contract -- should make along crossruff lines, taking at least 6 hearts, 2 spades, 1 diamond, and 1 club.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i know, kidding|pg||
nt|psyck:  I'm told 15-17 3rd, no mention of it in cc though|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think stefanov would miss an occasion to open 1NT if system allows it|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, same contract same lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: unexpected lead|pg||
nt|ady: good spot for n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C maybe alerted because there are hands that would bid Puppet Stayman instead of 2@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1NT is mostly a matter of system than points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running scores  http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl   remember to refresh screen|pg||
nt|barnets: Italy bid 6@H too |pg||
nt|barnets: on 29|pg||
pc|s4|nt|twcho: sure, not your fault. :)|pg||
nt|eggy:  Also as NZ are playing Sweden (1.5 behind) there shouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you PASS  partner has @C   when you DBL pard has @D    example of Great Shuffler's sense of humor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction screams     lead trump THEN look at your hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italians are in 61H too on the slam hand|pg||
nt|barnets: no the final pass was retracted |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: lol|pg||
nt|brgpro: u need @d or @h to give u one more winner|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fluffy: the lead guesses diamonds for declarer, and now defeating 2@s will require a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|twcho: wow, they bid it|pg||
nt|kit: Most natural play is to lead diamond to king at trick 2, and another diamond.|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3NT is non serious or serious 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 more sets after this,  difficult for indonesians now to recover |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well stopped|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs behave but not much else.  Good lead - actually Bridge World has an article this month about the benefits of major suit leads against notrumps - and their general success.|pg||
nt|athene: versace wondering whether to start clubs with small towards the ten i suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great|pg||
nt|twcho: no matter what the double means, it must show some useful value. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they will realize after finished|pg||
nt|ritong: a top @s, that is|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6N?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6NT|pg||
nt|ady: not straight foward though  if spades 4-2|pg||
nt|ady: even in hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: then @C finesse?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@H 3@S 2@C 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT either on spades 3-3   or club finesse |pg||
nt|barnets: so that effectively will be the end of this match|pg||
nt|nkgupt: looks like we can say congrats to jaap and all the dutch:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes...|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: lovely 2@H bid can make or down but good board EW imo|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the session. I would like to thank Dirk, our splendid VG operator. Excellent session and many thanks!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: drive out @D ace before tackling @S |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3nt was non-serious|pg||
nt|ady: declined I would think|pg||
nt|gracelin: stopped accurately|pg||
nt|barnets: and he is still thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: now he passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|psyck: other room in 3@cW here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well they escaped, 3@C was down 2 for 300|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this may do worse but not doubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT a reasonable contract on those cards.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|boedhy:  4nt quantitative|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, unless you're in 6NT and you get the wrong lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  could be 12 tricks played from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the spectators all know how to make six, declarer does not|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: another down 1 EW joke|pg||
nt|hedyg:  very lucky lie of cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Sementa: this the match for 3@H and 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: proble though idf A@D is with south and club comes back   ?|pg||
nt|ady: problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: BBO|pg||
nt|jfeld:  That switch won't work out well, as North no longer has an entry to give the ruff|pg||
nt|jfeld:  most likely this will make now|pg||
nt|fluffy: whatever it was they stay at a safe level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin in 3@H East|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@C and 4@D are cue-bids suggesting a slam and showing a control in the suit bid. Also 4@H.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: develop all @D is a dummy play|pg||
nt|brgpro: but i think it is still way better than a Roland standard slams|pg||
nt|brolucius: A good auction. They took a look at it and decided against.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not impossible though|pg||
nt|engsetter:  this has been a great set for the England ladies I think a lead of 47 will be hard not out  of sight yet|pg||
nt|nkgupt: and well tried , bad luck to italy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: if he carries on with this line he is going down|pg||
nt|lechcold: http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114883,10496682,Nielegalny_turniej_pokera_w_restauracji.html... tu widaæ co siê dzieje z tymi, którzy graj¹ w gry uzale¿nione od ...|pg||
nt|lechcold: szczêcia..|pg||
nt|ady: not to much of a problem with trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|ady: after all that   jsut 3NT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: cant East atleast bid 4NT |pg||
nt|barnets: China made a great comeback but Italy played tough when they neede to in the final set|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: dutch small lead after 4@H C|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|twcho: great bid by Edgtton|pg||
nt|kit: this really feels wrong to me.|pg||
nt|psyck:  @sQ from KQ or QJx|pg||
nt|ritong: varying from K to Q according to agreements|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think they may have just given back the slam swing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can lose also @D switch.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table just finished 26  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H-2 was a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told Italy-China WILL be on vugraph next set    no surprise there :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rensph:  3@C puppet stayman here, little to the play in 4@S> Declarer will draw trumps and then requires the @HK to be onside|pg||
nt|brgpro: with @hk on and come down 2nd, declarer has 11 tricks and can later squeeze E in @d and @s|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i have problems: i am a big fan of usa2 too:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: 1 @C ruff and the 1DA onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his partner didn't open|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt he bid 3@H over 1N by N|pg||
nt|xenya: or maybe just 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: conventional 2N   then corrected 3@D to 3@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can suspect four spades with West for his double.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lechcold: Grzegorz nie powinien tak siê emocjonowaæ swoimi walorami w czerwonych kolorach|pg||
nt|hedyg:  nnow 3@ss and disc @c|pg||
nt|antoniz: je¿eli to co ogl¹dam ma byæ wzorem wspó³czesnej walki....to chcê byæ starowiecki:)|pg||
nt|ady: and clubs splitting|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Chance was there to make 8 tricks but did not accept.|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N, i'm told |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rensph:  he might be able to play for a throw-in|pg||
nt|kamyk: w sierpniu 80 Rosiewicz piewa³: "Bulgarija,Bulgarija, u Polijaka awarija"|pg||
nt|brolucius: One down will be fine, against a making 2@H. Madala was unlucky to find only two trumps in the dummy. His bid was fine.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction a variation on mexican 2@D, west showed 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: of course the legitimate plan was to rely on 3-3 @S -- the line adopted by declarer works if the defence err twice -- not sure how good that is  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: another chance.|pg||
nt|barnets: and deserved their win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: these teams finished 1/2 in Round Robin  but conditions of contest said if USA1 and USA2 won Quarter Final they MUST meet in Semi|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: Also, many thanks to Kit and Joe, my fellow commentators. We were awarded a fair bunch of boards - neither excellent, nor hopelessly boring - somewhere in between.|pg||

nt|psyck:  All Results: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|ady: although this was a low scoring set    plenty of interest|pg||
nt|barnets: Italy V Netherlands USA1 VUSA 2 in Bermuda Bowl semi final tomorrow|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree the azurri wobbled badly but showed their talent and guts in coming back to win - the chinese should however be very pleased with their effort|pg||
nt|barnets: Sementa in 6@D remembered to cash the ace first |pg||
nt|roswolf: if they cash the hearts and exit woth a diamond this is down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobh1: what did W show?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 11 IMPs to Italy on the 6@C - 5@C deal.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: and good effort by Gosney too|pg||
nt|hlortz: and @c 3-3|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3rd from 6 cards...hmmm...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  should the throw-in fail (If S holds the 3rd spade) he can still finesse the hearts himself|pg||
nt|brgpro: but that is with open cards only|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|kareno: This is a hand I would rather leave to partner to declare always - too many choices.  I agree that a club to the ten is tempting.  The diamonds have opened a path for the defense.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i am just saying it for fun, nobody wants to be in it when looking at 26 cards|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jaapfr vg: ok 9 tr and last board|pg||
nt|ady: not much scope for Austrialia on hands 29 to 31    so this looks a convincing win for China|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, someday you will have to tell me about it|pg||
nt|twcho: this will be a serious blow for USA1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hlortz: oops 32|pg||
nt|psyck:  also available on www.bridgewinners.com a site most bridge players must be familiar with by now|pg||
nt|ady: hands 11 and 12 combined  4 imps for Italy   so very close |pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a great match and it has been a pleasure to watch, I am sure we all agree. Many thanks to BBO, once again, for  providing this service.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|engsetter:  excellent defence here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: He will still survive, but it seems so much more natural to set up at least 1 diamond trick first.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|twcho: the balancing double is absolutely normal by west|pg||
nt|twcho: but north had bid it much better than his counterpart in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there is so otfen when it is wrong too|pg||
nt|oosmanb: denied 3@S I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Our thanks also to the super-operator, Traian, who works miracles in that very difficult department. We appreciate it!|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c3|nt|lechcold: bez 2...a dobrego dnia mog³o byæ swoje|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: up to 17, bad 18 probably|pg||
nt|oosmanb: <18|pg||
nt|bobh1: then how can E pass?|pg||
nt|ady: what Poland got on hand 30  may go back on 31|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: because otherwise he'd open 1@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator, Natalia. Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for bringing this festival of bridge to our screens. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Oosman, Bob and David (and quite a few others!) for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose contributions ...|pg||

nt|ady: thx   all    thx specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to you also David |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: the last set will be WAR|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the semi final   and well played Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: no trudno..teraz ³adny szlemiczek|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think an alert kibitzer is right, was going down if diamond queen covered|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: last board of this match|pg||
nt|barnets: good but normal result for NS here|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session thx all  thx specs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: was extremely fast|pg||
nt|jkotor: a jeszcze dodam (nie chc¹ mimo wszystko wyjæ na nadwornego krytyka naszych)|pg||
nt|ritong: that one took 17 seconds other room, play included|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set begins 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|barnets: France beat china women by 9.7 imps i|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Paul, and my co-commentator Krishna, good job by both|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3nt NS with double @C finesse cold|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|vugraphznt: next match starts in 55 minutes from now|pg||
nt|ady: thx Natalia    thx specs|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer changes plan (somewhat incosistently perhaps), making contract |pg||
nt|rialc2: ciao a tutti|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board for us  -- other table finishing 28|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  throwing imps like candy..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board, we start again at 13.45|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: that is in 1 hour|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes do you know there agreements|pg||
nt|rhelle:  they play dstructive preempts this vul(doesn't everybody?)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  what is the range|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but the temptation to bid 6@c must be strong|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt overcall perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: would be interesting to see how lauria-versace handle such interference|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like a normal 4H hand on this last deal of the set.|pg||
nt|barnets: east overcalled one heart in open|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has preferred a double to 1@H (the modern choice) and may escape a penalty.|pg||
nt|ady: great result for USA here in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course they opened 1@D at the other table.|pg||
nt|ady: thx Gerbrand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Gerbarand you were great as always|pg||
nt|hedyg:  our thanks to our outstanding operator in Eindhoven, Gerbrand Hop, well done! to my excellent fellow commentators David , Daniel , Gonzalo and Jaap as well as CK, William and Ralf on voice for donating their time to guide us through these boards|pg||
nt|jkotor: ¿e tylko jedna para z tej reprezentacji gra³a ostatnio wszystko razem i gra w lidze razem|pg||
nt|eggy:  I can't see too much potential for a disaster either way here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D, unbal|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator, Harold. Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for bringing this festival of bridge to our screens. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Naresh and Barnet for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|barnets: in very close match and a 4 imp carryforward|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Thanks to all the wonderfull commentators and the Kibs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@S  maybe any longer suit  but not 5@S 5@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rhelle:  getting to 6@d now is too hard, I think|pg||
nt|rensph:  Even if spades break 4-1 taking the ace and returning a spade works equally well|pg||
nt|antoniz: bardzo trudny po otwarcie przeciwnika|pg||
nt|fabsayc: about the time they finish in open room :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  That is extremely fast for 1N|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the senior bowl Poland moved to the win from behind on bd 32, making x'd games in both rooms.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: here even not enough though:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: This may well turn out to be a historic match. It is great to be able to see it unfolding, live and free of charge, on BBO. |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thanks all see you back tomorrow....|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Martin, Paul, & kibitzers|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx all! see you after lunch :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: So many thanks to Bob Drijver our excellent Operator.  To the specs for their wit and wisdom.  To Bill Frisby for his contributions and, of course, to WBF for allowing us to watch ...|pg||
nt|kareno: their marvelous production of the world championships.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Opened room started 10 minutes later than this room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are bidding 15 there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: because the match is on VuGraph|pg||
nt|ady: slam to finish|pg||
nt|gulyas: ty all, it was an exciting match here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they did england out of a vulnerable game there, so that's some back|pg||
nt|engsetter:  a failing slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: bocchi pointing out 3H makes|pg||
nt|idc: Last board at this table (the Open room have 4 more though) so time for thanks:|pg||
nt|santyclz: True, only 16 imps....|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: Dennis tx for perfect job as usual and congrats to China|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  4@d may be an artificial slam try in @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will bid 5@c now expecting @h points|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally, this double shows a desire to penalize opps, but my guess is EW just use it to show some values|pg||
nt|barnets: I prefer the unfortunate 1@H bid|pg||
nt|twcho: last board for this round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a memorable victory for Australia|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: We will be back at 13.45 local time|pg||
nt|petergill: West is thinking about whether to convert to 4@H|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Peter, a good win for your country|pg||
nt|petergill: If W does bid 4@H, then @SA lead works well, but might not be South's choice after this auction. The 3@S raise at the other table worked well, by guiding S to @SA lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  David Bird would be pleased with that speed though|pg||
nt|ritong: talking about this slam:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: defence helped too:)|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s can make 5@C      |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: you're welcome :) thanks all for the commentating|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: ths Denis|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: tx David and kibs last session at 16.45|pg||
nt|ady: thx specks|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and then Icelands faith has been put into other hands|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Having a stiff spade and a good suit, bidding 2@H is clear and not close in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I cant figure out if Iceland is safe in Top8 -- but I think not, yet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Ugly 2@c...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that must be 2 way drury, with 3 card support in @H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: 1@D will be a transfer bid.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  as well as to the World Bridge Federation and to the World Bridge Federation with the Nederlandse Bridge Bond for sharing this important event  with us,especially to Jacob Hop who is instrumental in organising the broadcasts on behalf of BBO!|pg||
nt|jkotor: przed ME cykl powa¿nych przygotowañ by³ trochê d³u¿szy i porz¹dniejszy|pg||
nt|ritong: merci karen|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder how many of the 2394 kibitzers are praying that their manager will not suddenly enter the office. (I remember the feeling).|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: starting tomorrow at 10.30|pg||
nt|ady: thx Kevin     thx all  thx specs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees owes vanProoijen a @S|pg||
nt|nkgupt: thx all and congrats/wd to NED and the team:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told France came back to beat Poland in Senior|pg||
nt|brgpro: thanks and congrats to Netherlands|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: The next session starts in around 1 hours and 10 minutes. It will be the last session of the day.|pg||
nt|kit: This time it is right to play the 5-3 major-suit fit|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even promising spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board for the day, back tomorrow at 10.30 Paris time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: here at the playing site in Veldhoven|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our excellent operator Jan Nielsen|pg||
nt|idc: to my fellow commentator Joe and to our Operator Paul|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie p³aczmy na zapas,do strefy awansu niedaleko, jutro jest nowy dzieñ|pg||
nt|garden2005: nast¹pi przebudzenie|pg||
nt|ady: another game for n/s|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|ritong: but north has a lot|pg||
nt|ritong: brutal bids of that sort must be precise|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes N will get to slam opp a positive response|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess would be 5332 9/10|pg||
nt|psyck:  1@c is 17+, so 8-9HCP 5332 for the 3N maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: anyway stefanov will drive on|pg||
nt|ritong: he is considering which way|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: and return whilst last round RR is full of tension|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 16-board sessions tomorrow to finish the Quarter Finals|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vugraph match for next set will be netherlands-italy with voice commentary|pg||
nt|engsetter:  but at well under 50% should not be there|pg||
pc|s4|nt|boedhy:  still liking his hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite this loss of Italy they still do lead the Round Robin pack after round 5|pg||
nt|idc: to the WBF for allowing us to broadcast this event|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Martel doesn't particularly mind a @s contract by e-w.|pg||
nt|idc: and as always to Roland and BBO, without whose work none of this amazing stuff would happen|pg||
nt|hedyg:  special thanks to our specs for joining and the kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
nt|ady: may take some bidding   4th heart and the jack  the key|pg||
nt|hlortz: thx David, Hasan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board, thanks to our operator Felipe and to my co-commentators Peter and Henry|pg||
nt|ritong: sober|pg||
nt|ady: bad splits in the majors may beat any major suit game    but  5 clubs looks a make getting diamon d position right|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: tension here already. The Dutch all follow their ladies team|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: anyone any idea of ages N and S?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: currently 8th, but France in 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Ultima board del segmento|pg||
nt|fluffy: grue-lall got a very good result here|pg||
nt|fluffy: after EW found their 4-4 spade fit Grue on north doubled knowing his partner had 4@s and he had a big hand after opener|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: We will be back at 16.45 local time|pg||
nt|gracelin: or about 64 minutes from nw.|pg||
nt|ady: Bocchi got his 2 suits in|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I wouldn't be surprised if we will see the last quarter of this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: shi should respect the vul and pass imo|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rensph:  in this layout it all mattered very little, had north held the @HK it would've been a very effective @SQ|pg||
nt|famus: i rate them favourite to win|pg||
nt|gracelin: some care is needed here.  But I am confident Shi will also bring this home.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: LIAN already left the table|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a well educated quess Famus±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: the next match will start in 40 minutes from now.  Tks all for watching and hope you have enjoyed some great hands.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will also like to thank Felipe, our most capable operator who explained many bidding sequences to us.|pg||
nt|pelu: a way to play is @cA - @H to Q, @hA and then 4x@D discard @s, then @C AND MAKING 11|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks tough for E )DD very easy'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he is afraid for @H loss @C@C and @SA for down 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer want to cash HA first as a safety play(he could afford t lose one trump), but here the threat for club overruff made that play not totally safe.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and very afraid for ducking this IF S 6 card @C|pg||
nt|famus: playing @hA is sure wau to -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7 card|pg||
nt|famus: 6 cards he has so needs to duck|pg||
nt|gracelin: with a 7-card club suit at this Vul. south may have bid more.  so duck the first club then take trump finesse maybe a good way.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope he does not go for the line @CA @HA x@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: dojd¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba...|pg||
nt|jkotor: OBY!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fate -- not faith off course :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a flyer by the azurri on the last hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: but that only comes to 8|pg||
nt|brolucius: The boards have been OK in this set, but not especially wonderful. You wouldn't want fireworks all the way, in a 96-board match.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and this one likely a push also at = |pg||
nt|bobholl: sjoert will play a small @C at a certin moment i am certain :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we will start the war in 1 hour exactly :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: and Lauria will go up the K for sure...|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is too good to miss the last set! |pg||
nt|brgpro: why defenders are so friendly...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has three certain losers, as the trumps/clubs lie, and must avoid his two diamond losers. |pg||
nt|bobholl: :):) also certain |pg||
nt|kemperg: :):):):) well done|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: and to the spectators for some alert analysis|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and to the commentator for an excellent job |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do you think 3@d is forcing or not here?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W seems to be in doubt|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @S or @H lead 9|pg||
nt|brgpro: but on @d lead...he might have to duck twice|pg||
pc|c4|nt|boedhy:  now pass finally|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good sequence - 5@c is again 50% at best|pg||
nt|boedhy:  slam again 50% or so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well the 6 card trump support is hardly clear|pg||
nt|antoniz: mnie jest po prostu smutno,ale wierzê w przebudzenie naszych reprezentantów:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: * nie chc¹c|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie by³y to ³atwe rozdania|pg||
nt|psyck:  whichever strain he chooses will work as cards lay|pg||
nt|psyck:  6@c the normal choice to protect @dK|pg||
nt|eggy:  on this score they are safe I think|pg||
nt|jfeld:  So, Iceland looks safe to me|pg||
nt|jfeld:  Even if Japan blitzed they can't catch them|pg||
nt|eggy:  japan cannot pick up enough more (they are on 21 already)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: If that is so I will congratulate both teams in this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: starting times same throught the event|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we will be covering the other matches including this with written commentary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so D'Orsi Senior Bowl    France vs USA2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North: you guys have a bit of a @h fit|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, you'd better reserve your seats for the entire tournament - there is much wonderful bridge coming up!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W decides that 3@d was non forcing and passed|pg||
nt|petergill: At this vulnerability, I'm a big fan of Fleischer's decision to treat KQx as four spades |pg||
nt|petergill: Fleisher I mean|pg||
nt|twcho: if non-@s lead, declarer will go down at most one|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA lead ---> 300 when declarer has to try for 3-3 trumps to try to make his contract, but I think a @D lead might be more likely|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: Dennis?|pg||
nt|rialc2: siamo tutti scossi dalla scomparsa del "grande Sic"!|pg||
nt|fluffy: this double sometimes won't work obviously, but today it brings 500 that can't be beaten|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this should make 5|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Not the most effective lead.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lechcold: :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder if he has A10x in spades if things would have been different|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Li just left the room -- and now Liu is on his own -- will he manage that?|pg||
nt|ehsana: .....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile 5@D in open room going down undoubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi now has a decision to make. Pass, 2NT, 3@D? He has chosen 2NT.|pg||
nt|ady: request for a link to running scores please|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@SX would not have been much fun|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||

nt|lechcold: gra od pocz¹tku siê nie klei, to prawda|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: a o 16.45 - mecz open Polska-Izrael, rowniez z przekazem wideo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this result wont help Sweden, who are borderline for qualifying to KO stage|pg||
nt|hlortz: thanks msrtin peter and our great kibs & operator.. it was a 2 board match for usa team...|pg||
nt|ritong: pard can hold @s KQJxx and an ace, perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: australia pulled back 5 on hand 29|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Shi seems rather old, Lian is younger (like 30s or 40s)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they did|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy has forged ahead.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|twcho: now declarer is safe from being punched|pg||
nt|gulyas: S probably showing distribution here|pg||
nt|hlortz: /martin/|pg||
nt|ady: not many top losers in hears with J9 doubleton   but spade force may deadent the club suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Vladimir and Harold and all the specs, absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s look out of the bidding at this stage|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: once i told Shi is old, he immediately took out his 5@c :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: what a bid 5@C:)|pg||
nt|ady: oh a different turn|pg||
nt|resurectin:  not sure after interference, but usually 2d shows normal opening hand|pg||
nt|eggy:  and sweden are playing New zealand who are the only others who can pvertake them|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd13 cost china 13imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 actually|pg||
nt|gracelin: actually 11, 200 + 300|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitch a heart and club to 10 seems normal to me|pg||
nt|brgpro: then play a @c to the 10, after the 4th @d cashed he will go down...no squeeze chances|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz2:  Although the dummy's @c holding looks ominous.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think south showed some @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Gerbrand when is restart please?|pg||
nt|garden2005: dziêkujê za wspólne kibicowanie - dobranoc :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: I love 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: dont know where that came from|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: from SHI|pg||
nt|yuval10: if X over 2@c was for a lead, and showed good suit, then why not?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think edgtton is writing that dbl shows interest in bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|ady: though not sure about the west double?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  This looks like an easy 9 tricks with Diamonds coming home|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rensph:  3N is made on a heart lead and continuation here, but if defenders set up a diamond trick early on declarer will still have to find the @SQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  I'm also informed that lauria made 4@S on this hand|pg||
nt|rensph:  3NT, sorry|pg||
nt|jacksond: if plays donde for spade queen he makes quite easily|pg||
nt|rensph:  sorry, 3N making with clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: been called worse|pg||
nt|psyck:  well, if 3N limited hand, he is not looking fro grand|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: from N's double?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yyy|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hoi vlad|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: can't properly read the note, all writing are mixed together|pg||
nt|ritong: the line is interesting, though|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you proceed?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  duck 2 spades|pg||
nt|ritong: means two discards from dummy|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and try to duck a heart to the safe hand|pg||
nt|jfeld:  I would pitch a club|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: North realised that his partner must have had some purpose in bidding 2@C checkback. When it turned out that he was not looking for four hearts, he knew that he must have been ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: looking for a 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@C Krzysztof potraktowa³ jako normalny cue-bid|pg||
nt|famus: Thnks Henery--and i go along with the n key:)|pg||
nt|ady: clubs in fact blocked if the play 3NT    4 spades safer|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know it Italy in slam on hand 31?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yes they are|pg||
nt|ady: apparently ye    tht so|pg||
nt|jfeld:  and a heart|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: thanks Rashed, Harold -- and everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wlc|pg||
nt|yuval10: S wanted to bid it anyway but wanted to hear more from opps|pg||
nt|xenya: hoi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: all pressure now on E|pg||
nt|ady: I agree 5@C  from Shi a good possibility   but seemed to be lrking in wings for a couple of rounds|pg||
nt|yuval10: he was affraid that the bidding will stall after 3@s so he bided what he wanted to bid at first place|pg||
nt|ady: this must confirm a good win for China|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: assuming this makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: grue hand was a problem response to the overcall, 1@S or 2@C would have worked better|pg||
pc|c3|nt|boedhy:  and offcourse this one is down on @s lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  thinking about it, 6@c is down on a @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: 10 easy tricks with spades splitting, but only 8 in notrump|pg||
nt|brolucius: if you want to listen to Voice Commentary, you should go directly to website: http://www.bridgebase.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 16.45 1hr 20 from now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they go for 6@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: next set starting at 16:45|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably 3NT is 5422, and now north has to think|pg||
nt|hedyg:  shame only the 1st page of the NS CC is loaded :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ so vital here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I try to read what South wrote down|pg||
nt|fluffy: against many 8 HCP hands 6@d has no play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Lauria did bid 4NT as East|pg||
nt|yuval10: it will|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yes it will make|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: simple after this lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pls kibs we are not responsible for the bids of the players:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i hear Lian 45 and SHI 47 (your bridge much better than yr agequessing Dennis:)|pg||
nt|eggy:  if he ducks enough spades East he might even end up with a squeeze of West for +1 I think|pg||
nt|bobholl: now the small @C comes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|famus: yes--too tired--as pointed out by informed kibtz-- taking @H  A wud need to squeeze|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Versace has bid 6@H|pg||
nt|ritong: now he has an avoidance play if east has three@hs including exactly one card superior to the 8|pg||
nt|brolucius: If declarer had to play this club suit himself, he would have to play to the king. So, he would be reluctant to run a club switch to the jack. |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bye for now|pg||
nt|kareno: So that's it and Italy will get most or all of the VPs for this match.  Well done!!|pg||
nt|rensph:  lets see how declarer handles 4@S here though|pg||
nt|gracelin: He play Hear to break 2-2 or a singleton honor drops.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pity|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy recovered 19 mps in last 2 boards for a tied match.  Bye all|pg||
nt|famus: so a well deserved 1 imp:) thnks all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still China wins    wddddddddd±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.  They tied with both Sweden and Italy today|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±' ±'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i try to smile but fail............±)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ty everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: see you soon|pg||
nt|lechcold: przyda³oby siê 4N jako cue-ogólny|pg||
nt|petergill: If @CJ to king at Trick 2, then on @DK N will play @D9 as suit pref for @SA underlead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@D plsssssss|pg||
nt|ady: may know shape   but needs KJ hearts as well as QD|pg||
nt|fluffy: he is also worried about clubs because he has @cQx and partner could have 2 low|pg||
nt|fluffy: wooldridge and hurd probably play a conventional 1NT-2NT|pg||
nt|ady: got 11 imps on 13  where China went down 3 in 4@H     China played 3@C  down 1|pg||
nt|ady: a little unlucky for China|pg||
nt|barnets: tks all specs for your many helpful comments, shinalssemi foud be some great bridge in the semi finals |pg||
nt|brgpro: if E continues a @d now i think he would surely go down|pg||
nt|bobholl: bluff and super bluff|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah, the low club that Bob predicted.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: now Lauria in the tank lol|pg||
nt|brgpro: K...why would they help|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now declarer must guess right. (Lauria has guessed right a few 1000000 times before).|pg||
pc|cT|nt|antoniz: po kontrze w 3tr,chyba lepsze 4tr|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: jutrzejsze przekazy zaczynaja sie o 10.30|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: declarer can not go wrong imo|pg||
nt|yuval10: the server is sometimes sluggish but that's the correct URL|pg||
nt|ady: hand 30    china fained 5 imps making +80 in 1 spade|pg||
nt|ady: gained|pg||
nt|ritong: giving up on that suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: bye all|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all for now|pg||
nt|barnets: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we keep the room open until the other table finishes....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: this likely to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: (My spelling is better than my typing.)|pg||
nt|barnets: should the two teams meet later on in the KO stages|pg||
nt|barnets: a good match and especially fine performance by the young USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: East doubled 1@C, so not certain that declarer will score four diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will not hold a singleton diamond for his double, so declarer will start with the @DK.|pg||
nt|ady: maybe south will raise|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|gulyas: no reason to, he told his story already|pg||
nt|fluffy: soth has told his story, he is not raising|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South going through the auction, and asks who is declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And told he has a good hand for N|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they are|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finishing on a game swing for USA2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: I should also thank the players - been a lot of good bridge to watch|pg||
nt|ady: has he shown the vital Q@D?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes but his hcp are so beautiful|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North could do a slam try|pg||
nt|ritong: i would do like you, jason|pg||
nt|ritong: keeping the @h option|pg||
nt|rialc2: interessante e simpatica la difesa di Ovest: sfortunatissima nella situazione|pg||
nt|rialc2: a più tardi. Ciao|pg||
nt|fluffy: so 2@c and then 2NT didn't promise any major|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes!|pg||
nt|brgpro: leaving it to himself, he would have to play a @c to the K anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|bobholl: i told you before :( |pg||
nt|brgpro: so did I|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ady: especially getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|barnets: this will still be a small swing to USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: With -500 on there partners' card, it was very much the right thing to do (as it happens) to bid game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..their..|pg||
nt|barnets: who will win this match and have a carry forward of some kind|pg||
nt|ady: may make even with 3 diamonds    as long as playing 1st club from north|pg||
nt|ady: thx Henry Hasan|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Lauria now thinking of bidding 6NT vs pass|pg||
nt|gracelin: CJ?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 down in 3@C   so net gain of 500 for Italy|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  This looks as if it will be another swing to USA 2.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: venice cup   France vs Indonesia|pg||
pc|h4|nt|boedhy:  well good start for the Netherlands...and with all these difficult and lively boards fun to watch|pg||
nt|boedhy:  bye bye|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ok, thx all - see you in an hour|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bye|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: tx for all congratulations (as a Dutchman)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA2  advances to 2 finals   France in 2 finals|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: 4@H made -- looks quite a feat... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense didn't play @D early enough|pg||
nt|xenya: so the ddefence slipped in the other room -- and the same may well happen here...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brgpro: i can see only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: Now S must rise on @CJ|pg||
nt|kamyk: no ale pamiêtajmy o chorobie Narkiewicza - to musia³o miec istotny wp³yw; ten sam sk³ad by³ w stanie osiagn¹æ du¿o wiêcej; no i jeszcze nie wszystko stracone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if West has @CK  that doesn't help the cause|pg||
nt|brgpro: the @d lead was the killer|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Is it my imagination or does USA 2 frequently make huge gains on the last few boards?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: Indonesia?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: doubled paert score sing   China played 2@C making 10 tricks in OR on hand 30|pg||
nt|yuval10: also http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: China have put a very creditable performance this match  |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: I think will get diamond right   as does not want west on lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could easily be 4-4-4-1 for his initial take-out double.|pg||
nt|ady: well thx all|pg||
nt|jbennet: wd NS |pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought he might try @SQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|fluffy: his hcp are maximum yes jaap, but partner could have anything|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx all cu in 1hr and 20 min|pg||
nt|hedyg:  he had 2 jacks in his beautiful hcps LOL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes tx all bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: thnx all|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: J@C   might have been better|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jaapfr vg: b17 and b17 made up for the exact difference between China and Australia sofar|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: b17 and b26|pg||
nt|jbennet: at last a pair who ventured biddin in early stage. reaching their unbeatable 5 Clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think official playing time was over 7 minutes ago, but no director yet|pg||
nt|yuval10: it looks like the first 5 teams are locked in the QF ( Italy, NET, USA2, Israel and USA1 ) , while many teams are struggling for the last 3 spots|pg||
nt|xenya: so China was 2.5VP ahead of Australia after board 30. With Sweden pressing closely behind the last round is going to be fascinating|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: When you Join a table that has voice commentary (there will always be two during the world championships), you can switch on each of the three commentators.|pg||
nt|famus: tx David|pg||
nt|pelu: the "slam" here need @S 3-2, K onside and @D 3-3|pg||
nt|ritong: which does not cancel the @c option|pg||
nt|jfeld:  well it does |pg||
nt|ritong: does it?|pg||
nt|jfeld:  because of entries|pg||
nt|eggy:  well no squeeze for +1 then as the heart threat has been thrown|pg||
nt|ritong: you have to play for QJ on, no?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|hlortz: bye|pg||
nt|famus: byee|pg||
nt|jfeld:  you can't try diamonds first then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: France v Indonesia in Venice Cup final|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|barnets: I am not sure of the exact carryovers but it usually depends on which team finishes higher in the round robin|pg||
nt|brolucius: West false-carded the @DQ, to mislead declarer as to the position of the @DJ.|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³yszenia,dziêki|pg||
nt|ady: rast now a bit end played because of club play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy have stemmed the flow of IMPs in the last set, taking the session 25-7 with a couple of comparisons to come. The final session will be something to savour.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, he didn't listen us to lead CJ earlier.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: standings after this round : Neth 161 Italy 155 Israel 149 and usa2 137|pg||
nt|idc: including that last play - East realizes he can afford 2 trump losers but only if he starts on side suit immediately|pg||

nt|fabsayc: thanks to all the commentators, spectators and especially our operator, good job|pg||

nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|ady: kept the loss to 1 imp|pg||
