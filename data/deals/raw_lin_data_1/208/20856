nt|brolucius: 22-IMP lead and the home supporters are cheering.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers are telling me they will not know what to do when this tournament is over!|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am just looking at the Americans' convention card. Strong 1@C and 14-16 1NT non-vul.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 15-17 points 3rd vul and 4th always.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C and 2@D as for normal Precision Club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is just room on my screen for the Dutch c-card too. I will get it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Dutch play a system that is sometimes difficult to understand. Al Hollander is the expert on it, but I guess he will be asleep at this time in the USA. |pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011  for live video. Turn sound off if you want to listen to the BBO commentators instead (we hope you do :))|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although we may not understand their bidding, they do and that is why they are 22 IMPs in the lead. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: OK|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Dutch won their semi-final against Italy after a match that was close throughout, solely because they bid two excellent slams in the last set. The Italians missed both of them. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius:  |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: gm all|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that apart from a few relay sequences, Brink Drijver play a mostly natural system. It was another Dutch pair who play abstruse methods.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That's good news for us.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: this the finest table of the whole tournement imo:)|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is always a slight delay at this table, so we will get comparison results from the Closed Room.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi, Kit!|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hoi:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: They probably will not start for another 5 minutes, so excuse me while I take a very quick shower. brb.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: another exciting 80 boards ahead|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 2@H a good safe start for Dutch (here NS might compete with 3@C|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|kit: I agree.  South shouldn't be selling out to 2@H holding a doubleton heart.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Of course it is a little easier if North shows he has real clubs by rebidding 2@C instead of passing.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: he felt too weak to do that|pg||
nt|brolucius: Same bidding at both tables. If you put your cursor over the Closed Room result, you can see the other bidding on a board.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jaapfr vg: exact copy of bidding in CR|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: already took a shower David:)?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Must have done...|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: South should work out that North has a real club suit.  North didn't raise spades or make support double, so he doesn't have 3.  North presumably has only 3 hearts.  If North were ...|pg||
nt|kit: 4-4 in minors, North would have opened 1@D.  Therefore, North figures to have 5 clubs.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|brolucius: There would still be a risk that partner placed him with more points for 3@C (not a full-blown game-try, I agree, but still a little more.)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|kit: This looks like a good result for USA1.  3@C making required fortunate lie in both hearts and clubs.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: sorry, usa2|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: tough for S now|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's redouble showed that he was heavy for his 1@S response. Indeed, some would have bid 2@S on his hand.|pg||
nt|kit: Once again, the key is to compete over enemy 2 of a major when the bad guys have an 8-card fit.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pass not good but what else?|pg||
nt|kit: South could bid 2NT, which presumably would ask for better minor.|pg||

mb|2N|nt|jaapfr vg: 7 2nt and 1 pass|pg||

pc|sK|nt|jaapfr vg: and 1 for X total 11-1-1|pg||
nt|kit: Note the club position.  To make, declarer will need to lead toward the J9 of clubs, and then when West goes up king bang the jack through on the second round.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||

nt|kit: Alternative is to simply lead ace and a club, which gains when either opponent has KQ doubleton.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Grue played 10 of clubs, not king.  He should also do that with 10x, giving declarer a guess.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you start with a low club and the Q or K comes from West. He is twice as likely to have Q10 or K10 than KQ (Restricted Choice).|pg||
nt|kit: but he might have 10x!|pg||
nt|kit: South knows the defense is capable of making that falsecard.  It is a good example of playing the card you are known (or about to be known) to have.|pg||

nt|sybarra: lots of questions re the pass of 1 nt by N on first board,  anyone have any insights? |pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I do|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 - 15. North has 10, with a 3343|pg||
nt|roswolf: it does show that everyone is watching carefully:)|pg||
nt|harmon: only chance to beat this is with swindle win 1st dwith ace|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|rhelle: so a max of 25, and the risk of going off in 2NT for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx that should settle the cannibals down|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd pass that hand as well|pg||
nt|ady: Netherland may lose around 6 on hand 17  where they stopped in 1NT  with 25hcp|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up club suit for 1 loser playing west for 1 high hnor and 10   doubleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: a good one forthe dutch in the bank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Tarzan Precision   so weak 2@D not available  |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: tarzan =  wijs-muller  [like name of actor who played tarzan]|pg||
nt|ady: not much on for anyone  here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: long ways to go in the match.... just can not let the get too far ahead |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: come in    the water is warm|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Wijs asks about if 1 of them dbled 2@D, they answer t/o...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: original tarzan was buster crabbe|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|roswolf: after all that 4@H seems far too boring|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   likely stopping place|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: 6@C  good contract   but fails on bad trump split|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you look at the NS hands of board 17 in isolation, and you'd give a score in a bidding competition, you score 10 for 1NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c: you have a sure @d loser, and a 2nd @s loser if the @dA is wrong. So not so great ...|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands done well to keep out of alsm|pg||
nt|rhelle: and that is only if the @sK is right|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|roswolf: on bd 2 team america in 6@C i am told|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: thought he might duck in both hands |pg||
nt|rhelle: Of course, 6@c looks good even when the @sK is offside - if the @d A is onside|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|rhelle: but on a @s lead, it gets decidedly less good|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d8|nt|ady: problems|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rhelle: now declarer has some problems, and needs to start looking for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: now what ?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd say, start by setting up a 2nd @s trick and advance the @s J|pg||
nt|ady: K@D best chance  |pg||
nt|ady: I think needs an error in defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: East has to duck, otherwise you have another entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ady: J@S   east can just win and return a heart  and no problem then for defence|pg||
nt|ady: does not have to duck   just clear hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: many ways home from here|pg||
nt|rhelle: I hear various lines of play from the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|rhelle: To be honest, I'm not sure about any of them|pg||
nt|sybarra: but so much easier from this vantage point, dont you think?|pg||
nt|ady: wests play of 10@H  seems odd    maybe a view graph error|pg||
nt|rhelle: Declarer has noted the @h discard on the 1st @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no error, W started @H 10...|pg||
nt|ady: well seems to be an error in defence  10@H lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: Where are the points? the 3rd hand 1@h doesn't promise the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Muller thinking of every possible distribution,  knowing the @C and (maybe) hts|pg||
nt|frankaus: even from  up here the way forward is not clear|pg||
nt|frankaus: all the kibs and gib make it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller is trying to work out why East played @H9 at Trick 1. With QJ98x, East would overtake @H10, in case it was a singleton.|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer seems to have 9 tricks; 3@c, 2@d, 2@h, 2@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: but how to get them before the defence has 5?|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome petergill|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Peter |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room   19 also 3@C south|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|s5|nt|petergill: Hi. The defence makes no sense to South. That's why Bauke Muller, normally slow and thoughtful, is even mroe slow and thoughtful now |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|c6|nt|petergill: West's @HQ lead fooled everyone|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: he led @H 10 |pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphznt: NS claimed|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: this is 4th of 8 16-board segements   5&6 played later today  7&8 tomorrow|pg||
pc|s6|nt|frankaus: here comes the end play|pg||
nt|rhelle: surely East will unblock the @dJ when the Q is played|pg||
nt|ady: needs to unblock   is experience enough to kmow|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he have the @D spots for that?|pg||
nt|rhelle: but it won't help, as then when West wins the trick, he can't play @h|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Joel Wooldridge's thinking with Q10 doubleton was that if partner has @HJ, leading the ten makes little difference to lead the ten, and if S has @HJ, then @HQ will score an ...|pg||
nt|petergill: unexpected trick over the jack later|pg||
nt|rhelle: so declarer's 4th @d will then become the winning 9th|pg||
nt|ady: but long diamond now good|pg||
nt|sybarra: so will play q of @D and @d |pg||
nt|rhelle: very likely. East is void in @c, so very unlikely the @sK is now singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: ducking a @d now looks safe enough, but S is checking if endplays are possible on other layouts|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|cJ|nt|petergill: unblock the jack was only chance on @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now endplay dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle: now that East doesn't unblock, exiting with a @h looks safe|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: sorry   i missed the good @H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: dummy squeezed|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: first     then endyplay|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|ady: unblcok was best    might have exited with a heart|pg||
nt|petergill: then atfer unblock, if declarer exited a heart - playing East for 4540 shape ---> -1|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
mc|4|nt|petergill: S was always exiting a @H after @DQ - else S would duck a @D without playing off @DQ|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: is the 2@C call artificial?  If natural, I don't think West can bid 3@C naturally.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|brolucius: After a start such as 1@D - Pass 1@H, many players use 2@D and 2@H as natural, since there are other ways of showing the unbid suits. 3@C as natural here is more unusual.|pg||
nt|kit: Contract is 6@D in other room, so a lot of IMPs at stake here.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: a very good result EW here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has bought well in the heart suit.|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is described on the card as game-forcing relay, but West will surely have asked for more info before venturing 3@C.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: i could not find a DD way to make 6@D|pg||
nt|tez: lead k of @h pls J:)|pg||
nt|kit: In my experience then 6@D will be made, as the players seem to do better single dummy than I can do looking at all 4 hands double dummy|pg||

mb|1D!|an|3+!D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what does South respond??|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 20: When @D8 won, West might have inferred that South had all the @d's higher than that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4+!D 10-15 hcp|nt|rhelle: and a useful 13 IMPs reward|pg||

mb|3C|nt|petergill: @DJ had to be played smoothly, in totally normal tempo under @DQ, to try to convince S it was E's last @D. That's the only way 3NT might have gone down|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am tols on bd2 america likely to make 6@C|pg||

nt|petergill: Good night Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: gn|pg||
nt|ady: nite|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I can't see East bid. 3@s was bid under pressure|pg||
nt|roswolf: A TRUE CANAPE OPENING|pg||
mb|4S!|an|denied !H cue|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@S was mildly conservative, after S's weak raise. 4@S was possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try 5@C which will discourage Bathurst from bidding more|pg||
nt|ady: sorry folks  have connection problems|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is easy, and 5@D looks OK, but if N doubled 3@C (t/o) to try to get to 3NT, S might pass and 3@CX would be cheap save|pg||
mb|5C|an|shows !H cue|nt|roswolf: it did and anothe 13 imps to team america as i predicted:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: very controlled auction |pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks    |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Have to pick @SQ (unlikely but not impossible) to make 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  Grue also in 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: In 2@D, Joe Grue will not go -4, more like -200, I predict|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|rhelle: the 3@h bid proved very effective in stopping EW reach their cold game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S   good contract    case for west to try 4@S    though cant say automatice|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Other room also in spade partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: West could have played @SJ instead of the third @d, to escape for -200, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue in same end position in 2@D  so -400 probably a push|pg||
nt|petergill: with trumps 4-1, declarer will need absolutely inspired play to make this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller thinks there was a break in tempo |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and asked for a director|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North didn't see it|pg||
nt|petergill: Easy for us with all 52 cards visible, but almost impossible to make 6@D looking at 26 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: before the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinks it was the fastest bid he made in the auction..|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20 was pushed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst leaves to the toilet now|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   alert 10-15 pts   4+ diamonds??|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphznt: North alerted it like that|pg||
nt|ady: may not be good news when he returns|pg||
nt|petergill: We all saw for ourselves how long it took for S's 5@D - though if we were all polled, we would estimate different amounts of seconds - such is the nature of human memory.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: not the dummy I Hoped|pg||
nt|ady: so some sort of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S denied @H control  so Zagorin 5@C not only shows the @C void but ALSO @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Think south decided to show his hand like this..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I couldn't read SW explanation|pg||
nt|petergill: If S did have a 4th @D, then 6@D would be a decent contract. |pg||
nt|rhelle: so, single dummy, how to play this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver start with 1@D [usually 5+]  -  2@C Relay, INV+|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 top tricks. Where to find 3 more, and lose only 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin doesn't know how to play yet, according to his body language|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither do we|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe take the ace, @h to the 9?|pg||
nt|rhelle: aiming to ruff 2 @h in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe he has a chance. Does the 3@C overcall suggest @SQ? More importantly, if East turns up with 4 @D's and 3 @hs when KQ drop and obv only 2 @C's then @SQxxx onside cannot be ...|pg||
nt|petergill: picked up for 4 tricks so the only hope might be Qx doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to think of the hand as if you were at the table and DO NOT know @SQ falling doubleton|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla:  great article on 4-5 minors openings: http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx   |pg||
pc|cK|nt|rhelle: this switch does not paralyse declarer|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: attempt to ruff 2 hearts  which as it happens wont be neccessary  and bank on spade finesse   4th spade discarded on club|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you ruff 2@h in dummy, you only need the @s finesse|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|vugraphznt: Drijver asked if they do it often bid 1NT with a 4crd Major|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   other room  Grue in 3@CX|pg||
nt|petergill: he plans to ruff two hearts in dummy then try to pick spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or deWijs to hold @HH10?|pg||
nt|ady: would be betterof without 10@S   which gives the losing option|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX should make 6 or 7 or so tricks, one would think|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is also the option of another @h finesse now ... to get rid of the losing @s|pg||
nt|petergill: If de Wijs inserts @H10 on the next @h from dummy, it's tempting to finesse the jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller probably plays @HK @HQ randomly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but perhaps @HK would give Zagorin pause|pg||
nt|rhelle: by now West knows that East has the @h KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that Rob?|pg||
nt|rhelle: so inserting the @h 10 is a doable false card|pg||
nt|rhelle: very unlikely that declarer would finesse the H9 in trick 2, missing only 10 and Q|pg||
nt|petergill: Many lines were possible e.g. if declarer could tell that clubs are 6-2 not 7-1 (at this vul, 7 card clubs might bid 4@C not 3@C), then alt line of ruff club and finesse @S10, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: eventually making on crossruff which needs 1-4 @D, was possible.|pg||
nt|rhelle: if Bauke had the Ace, he'd cash it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime   the other room, which started 10 minutes after us, is already on board 22|pg||
nt|petergill: We learnt yesterday (Wooldridge's 6@S) that predicting the outcome of the play of slams like this one is difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller taking 1 of his famous pauses..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult ... especially of the future|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I heard he is looking for inspiration in those|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller no doubt hesitating between a trump and a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, he's wondering why declarer pitched a spade at Trick 1|pg||
nt|rhelle: a trump to stop 1 ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|rhelle: or a @c to force declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: This long think, if read correctly by an opponent, might clue a Grue-like declarer into thinking that E does not have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it looked like he is about to play a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: with @SQ, E might exit more quickly in @d or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Transnational Quarter Final  with 8 boards to score  Gordon over [heavy favorite] Angelini  by 31|pg||
nt|rhelle: assuming what Muller has based on his pauzes is a very dangerous business, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a @d exit is normal now, as if you have a singleton club. Or perhaps exit with @S3?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|wstuart: Well, the 4-5 minor opening here has no choice - NS are playing a strong @C so the @D is nebulous.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S    but inlikely to lead club|pg||
nt|wstuart: When N rebids 2@C, he shows longer @C than @D.|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOLID SCORE FOR TEAM AMERICA|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: All the pauses he has done when I've been commentating have been very revealing about the cards he has in his hand, if the oppoent is a Grue, a Hamman or a Meckstroth (i.e. someone ...|pg||
nt|petergill: who can read such things)|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting ... maybe the Dutch coaches should analyse that|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer is wondering whether to play @S to dummy for @h hook, or play @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: has gone for former|pg||
nt|rhelle: that, incidentally, is the power of somebody like Helgemo|pg||
nt|rhelle: he always plays at the same pace - you never knows when he has a problem|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|petergill: the act of crossing to dummy makes @H hook likely - reasonable play on the bidding, simply unlucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why not play @H10,  the known card ??|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 8 ... Now West played low-high, techically and even number|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin saying somethin got de Wijs, and looking under the screen, all de wijs does is grin|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: ... it's amazing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin shaking his head|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: looking at Muller, maybe he is a poker player and tries to read EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter -- any comment about @H8 instead of @H10?|pg||
nt|petergill: I've sat EW and followed Bauke Muller around the room EW in pairs tournaments and can guarantee that he does NOT always play at the same slow pace - he takes his time only when he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: thinks he night have a problem. On many rounds, he was finished on time as EW. |pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: On this bidding, West had reason to believe the honours would be over his @SA and @CK and @DA - and right he was - but East had just enough for 4@s to be making|pg||
nt|petergill: @H8 could be from K108x. |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|petergill: @H10 might have worked better|pg||
nt|rhelle: well played!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 9 was already gone  so 10 known  [and 10 8 equal]|pg||
nt|petergill: Daniel Zagorin doing well, reading the play well, still has a chance|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: big swing for Netherlands  if this goes down which looks likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: apologies - forget that last comment|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: He can count the spades as 4-2 due to E having 4 @s and 3 @H and 2 @C and thus 4 @s|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh   now deWijs counts down to  2416   might take losing @S finesse|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|rhelle: nice touch, that @s9|pg||
nt|petergill: but for the bidding, is West likely to have @SQ, or is that irrelevant?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a priori odds   heavy favor the finesse|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed - they certainly turn over the imps|pg||

nt|petergill: Yes indeed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|rhelle: Yes, EW play attitude against NT, so declarer has no clue about North's @s length|pg||
nt|warrens:  now declarer hopes to learn something from the discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N can pitch 2 @h's and then one more card (=?) if clubs are run|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|s7|nt|ady: yes   that does cater for J10 diamonds onside   but in this case might go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: North not vul has passed over 1@C ---> 5 card suit a bit less likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: but that is only if you know @s are 4-4 ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more doesn't matter much non vul|pg||
nt|rhelle: remember kibitzers, NS play attitude leads. So the @s2 indicates an honour, not length|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|petergill: I think W has deliberately timed his club cashing sequence so N has to discard twice before South discards --> N's problem a little bit tougher|pg||
pc|s8|nt|warrens:  @D to the 9, then to the Q is 62.5%, so a @H to the QJ means you're more than 80% sure N has only 4 @S's|pg||
nt|petergill: W from the attitude lead knows N has @SQxxx or @SQxxxx so he wants North to discard before S, as S has easy @s discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N has (cunningly?) kept his @H discard until last, to try to look more like a man with 5332 shape|pg||
nt|rhelle: the big strength of NS is their incredibly tight defence|pg||
nt|petergill: (I think) N knew he had to make 2 more discards, so he released the @D (less comfortable discard) before the @H, to make the position less clear to West. |pg||
nt|petergill: If S releases another @S, W can play @H safely unless N has @HAK |pg||
nt|ady: whats the betting here?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm going for -1 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: red card discard, else this makes easily|pg||
nt|rhelle: but I'm heavily biased|pg||
nt|petergill: I was wrong - spade discard ---> @S can rise @HA on @H of dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: NS first discard   odd = encourage|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, but taking those discards at face value is a direct route to the poorhouse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S point was right, because then @S have broken 4-4, so S cannot throw a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: NS UDCA with 1st discard odd encourage|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H lead in OR    so no problem|pg||
nt|warrens:  we can see by this auction that W's distribution is concealed, making it harder for the defense (and putting us to sleep as we wait)|pg||
nt|petergill: so N's @D6 and @S's @S3 discard were really telling declarer as little as possible|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands might go in front |pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller is of course known for his phenomenal thinks|pg||

nt|warrens:  I think so, and he's certainly not leading into the AQJ of @H's anyway|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|petergill: It looks like a major card was led by the Dutch in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: was about last hand :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone either bid or implied @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: tough hand to play. If South has the @hK, North must have everything else - and then it's hard to make|pg||
nt|petergill: Correction - only Oz Open (q/f finished) and Parimatch (one board to go, 60+ imps ahead) have won the Transnat quarters - the other two matches have 4 or 5 boards to go|pg||
nt|ady: will certainly make if taking the right view now|pg||
nt|rhelle: So I think that he will finesse @h - easier than to rely on than lots of other things behaving|pg||
nt|ady: A@D and heart finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that Gordon v Angelini match is on BBO right now --  of the 8 players, 7 have won at least one world champtionship|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H was in case East was looking for slam - alas 4@H has wrongsided the contract slightly for the Dutch|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: think de Wijs wanted to force game and wasn't sure Muller had @S or @C|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|petergill: Good overtake by West|pg||
nt|rhelle: Oh - it seems that East made a mistake in the endgame to let it make|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south bids on the artillery will start firng|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North looks like to have minors|pg||
nt|wstuart: The lucky star the American EW were playing under burned out on board 4.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and south showed 6-4|pg||
nt|petergill: With so many possible finesses, is taking the @H hook only a play for those who can see all 52 cards?|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: EW lead attitude against NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 9 can be H98 or HH98, |pg||

nt|petergill: With only 16 HCP missing, North figured to have @HK, even with S's heart bids|pg||
nt|petergill: and he expects black kings to be offside in opener's hand, thus needed @H hook|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller worked that bit out fast - now, with limited entries to his hand, he has to figure out what to do next ---> takes time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director is here for some time already, didn't say they are late, but they are, and it looks like he is looking who is slow|pg||
nt|petergill: That also happened yesterday at Muller's table when playing against Hurd and Wooldridge|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rhelle: great switch!|pg||
nt|petergill: If EW had @S8, then I think Muller would cash @SA before the heart hook, in case @SK was singleton, but @SJ108x in S is hard to pick up with lack of entries|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|ady: not many options    best  surely ace and another spade   hoping for king doubleton   and when not trust to luck only 1 club loser|pg||

nt|rhelle: I'd say, looking at the sequence in the other room, that the result justifies the means :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2-3-6... |pg||
nt|wstuart: OK, they did start 10 minutes later than this table, to be fair.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 12-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous bid by S |pg||
nt|ady: east has nice hand  but will not be able to buy tje hand under the 7 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe 10 of @H as only entry |pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@s is a bit pessimistic though|pg||
nt|ady: maybe expecting further action  |pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, S led @D4 which worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room 1N was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: big difference which lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time   i would never choose @D lead over @C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director left after last board, directly slow again|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey once did a study of masses of hands which suggested that AJxx, K10xx , Q9xx and J8xx are the leads that turn out worst when faced with choice of 4 card suits to lead ...|pg||
nt|petergill: from to NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous is the word,  "weak in the knees"  timid etc |pg||
nt|rhelle: Unless Muller is playing a deep game|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts?|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is likely an inv+ xfr to @H/|pg||
nt|wstuart: Generally attributed to Jeff Rubens, often called Rubensohl (or transfer Lebensohl by some).|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: very light opening - in the modern style, or a very old-fashioned style, if you will - his hand qualifies easily by losing trick count, if not by honor count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you give up a trick after lead from Jxxx it usually doesn't come back   but  giving trick away after lead from K often does come back|pg||
nt|ady: cash out for down 1 on club lead|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bbramley: this is a poor setup for the N/S methods - north has been preempted into showing his second suit at a high level|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he wants to get doubled in 6 spades |pg||
nt|rhelle: no XX?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i didn't know KTxx was on the list|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst writing a lot, Zagorin just sitting not alerting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: semi alerts 2@C now|pg||
nt|ady: agressive move by north|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = penalty, shows max passed hand, acc to their System Card|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: or 5 ?|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, a striped tale X|pg||
nt|sybarra: no XX,  "we" are happy |pg||
nt|ady: good value for australians|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: stripe tail ape...preventing 6 sp bid|pg||
nt|petergill: 1050 to 1430 = 9 imps|pg||
nt|ady: Brink has a pretty useless hand for spades  especially on ace king and another spade opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: South surely has a dead maximum for his 14-16 1NT opening.  Facing the inv+ xfr, he has a clear 4@H bid.|pg||
nt|ady: this will fil   so dutch will dow ok here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: Grue: good luck, this time I mean it...|pg||
nt|ady: fail|pg||
nt|wstuart: It was a 1NT overcall, so he's not at a max.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Still, he has a fine hand with a fit, nice controls and a 5 card suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink has no idea if he is on time.. he asked they have 55 min for those last boards|pg||
mb|d!|an|t/o|nt|bbramley: of course, it's usually a poor setup to have a light opener into a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but sometimes pards clubs are more like his spade suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or spade suit is more like the club suit I should say |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - opening on distro is always optimistic, hoping for a fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you probably roll for 6 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he has 3 trumps to lose and the @H ace off the top, and there may be a handling charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps maybe the difficulty |pg||
nt|bbramley: although if he runs some diamonds, west may be tempted to compromise his trump holding (but i doubt he will)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12, 2 @S only went down 1 in other room,  for 3 imps |pg||
nt|bbramley: USA2 nibbling away...|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and we have a looooooooooooonggg way to go |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: maybe double after passing something in their methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Hurd may have tht diamond defensive with west   and only 4@S from Muller    |pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North will reason that EW have a @c fit - and that West will have the @d. So he'll pay a @d to the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: gee they split 1/1 |pg||
nt|petergill: Then 2@C shows usually 4!+ clubs, u run into your lowest suit. Dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|ady: everyone in the action|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bbramley: from declarer's perspective, all he needs is 3-3 trumps and a winning guess|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: yes give W the East cards and probably home |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the spade cards)  |pg||
nt|bbramley: other room stopped in 2@S and made 140, so this should be 6 imps more for USA2|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: This is fairly normal - I too play it - that you dbl with a max passed hand, taking pressure off partner's need to make marginal pen dbls when u are passed hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for passed hand balancing DBL to be Woolsey   4-major and 5+minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1-suit @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially for pairs that play Mini-Landy in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl backfired as it (unluckily?) pushed EW out of their poor 1NT contract into a better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mini-Landy = Woolsey but with DBL=Penalty|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: hoping to bring in club suit   and lose 1 club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: thats is the end of that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rhelle: but what did East double on? Even at my level, this is suspect|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl ---> 1600 to 1430 = 5 imps the other way, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry   Multi-Landy  not Mini|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: Now that East knows @DA is offside from the opening lead, he can perhaps ruff out the short @DA and make 2@S for a big gain|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|bbramley: this room has finally slowed down enough to let the other room get ahead - that will give us comparisons :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|warrens:  on a XX, wouldn't Hurd reconsider?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Senior   France now leads USA2 by 2|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down1   cannot ruff 2 hearts  and avoide a club ruff  if coming back with A@C    |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: BD3 1@hx-3 team america scored 660 on 3nt+2 so 4 imps to the home team|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Redbl would almost certainly go P P 6@C or 5NT by East, then what happens next = I know not|pg||
nt|ady: must have been a diamond lead  for 12 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D led|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder what 5@S would mean now? Natural, strong slam suggestion?|pg||
nt|ady: I am told it was|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its good to have an agreement what the meaning of 4@S is by west|pg||
mb|1N!|an|GF relay|nt|roswolf: and another 6 to the dutch on bd 8 - they bid and made 3nt|pg||
nt|wstuart: The dutch would be ahead by 2 now if not for the 18 IMP swing on board 2 where teh Americans bid approx a 2% slam which came in.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=game force relay|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rhelle: even so, nasty problem for West. It could be anything, from 4@s to 7@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is tightening nicely -(for us neutrals)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijver taking a postion  for a long thought|pg||
nt|roswolf: that weak2 by south is a hippy bid if ever i saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijer sighs a few times|pg||
nt|ady: will get to 6@S   iam sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: in a sense unlucky his pard is so weak|pg||

nt|ady: I  very much doubt pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oops   i don't know what they do after high interference :(|pg||
nt|ady: north fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: can we go back to 1N (about last board) to Muller|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S is reasonable, needs @HA onside or (if played by W) @HA lead - plus @S not 5-1 - and @d not 6-0!|pg||
nt|rhelle: Pass = Forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: denies a penalty X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Rob!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rhelle: Nor th wil certainly lead the @cA|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 imps to Netherlands, surely|pg||
nt|ady: that  very ambitius  with void heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: look in movie,  it was club lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps 5@S would be voidwood (void spade, loking for 7@H), so West's choices were 4@S and 6@S - a guess. |pg||
nt|ady: as long as they dont bid 7|pg||
mb|4S|an|if de wijs dbled, it would be t/o|nt|warrens:  needs to lead @C Ace or a @S|pg||
nt|rhelle: However, North's second card will be problematic. If it's a @d, it's made|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone says @D,  my movie shows club |pg||
nt|petergill: As the card lie, normal(?) defence of @HQ to ace then @DK back defeats 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S after long tht or no long tht  west would surely pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will S try 3 @H?|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I would win the trump and put N to the test by playing @CK at Trick 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  now, N has to rise on a small @C lead from W, which I think is easy to do looking at dummy's @H's|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry bd 30 a diamond |pg||
nt|ady: mine shows a diamond|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead might beat ..... 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  an excellent spot    only down on heart lead and diamond return|pg||
nt|petergill: but is double dummy, @H lead is very normal|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: the E hand looks like the ones I have been holding recently |pg||
nt|bbramley: none vul is best for competing - i'm surprised he didn't, altho he already bid twice and his partner was there|pg||
nt|sybarra: enough!! |pg||
nt|ady: yes   club lead   cant get back and forth|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: yes - when i was a hippy at university abd did something silly like this against Boris Schapiro - he called it a hippy bid and said i would learn someday - never forgot that|pg||
nt|wstuart: Well everyone, I have to go play live bridge myself now.  Have fun and we'll see you tomorrow (or late tonight for those of us on the west coast of the US.)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rhelle: This is though|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||

nt|ady: tricky   must play ace|pg||
nt|rhelle: very well played!|pg||
nt|ady: abd must resist diamond|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ady: north was awake|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK at Trick 2 could be a singleton king so might be taken, whereas the low club is more certain to draw the unwelcome ace (if @DK was onside)|pg||
nt|rhelle: South played the @c9, an even number|pg||
nt|warrens:  no way he'll play a @D.  W can't have been missing both minor aces|pg||
nt|rhelle: So my money is on another @c, to try and cut communications|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs, you really got 6? to Bathurst (but Zagorin didn't hear)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT would be crazy to be in - you can bid only your own 26 cards, not bid the 52 cards. |pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks like down a couple, but still a good save vs. the 140 that south could make in hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the OR made 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: W always on lead, to probably gives a trick somewhere |pg||
nt|bbramley: they may have gotten desperate trying to beat 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: to=so |pg||
nt|rhelle: both a @c and a @c are good - even a @h works as West can't get rid of 3 @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Bathurst bid 4@H with singleton Ace?|pg||
nt|petergill: S and W are on same side of screen - N and E on other side of screen|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|roswolf: this has just propelled e/w to slam - i trust south has flowers in his hair:)|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|bbramley: vs. 4@H: possible make even against passive defense if declarer reads the position|pg||
pc|sA|nt|warrens:  I don't believe it.  what was he playing for?|pg||

nt|brolucius: I am told: 4@D= partner pls bid 4@H and then I will bid the final contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|warrens:  So, South meant the 9 to show a @H card and N took it as an odd number|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: and we all know Wooldridge bids down the middle    [very heavy sarcasm]|pg||
nt|ady: now may have a squeeze  on west for an overtrrick|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: club lead  might have put 3NT in some jeopardy on a bad day|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|petergill: about that slam: Playing UDCA, S should have played @C3 to show four cards in clubs - when he did not, N went wrong. |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver used 2@C as relay  so they had plenty of room|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: was a razorblade 6@D (bidding)|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, well bid and well played.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: In the first set of this final, the slam bidding was surprisingly cautious. Kibitzers were chuckling at how often those in the Seniors final out bid them, also at the game level. ...|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: @C lead was not so obvious here so chance for Dutch|pg||

nt|sybarra: I think our operator is Vincent |pg||
nt|sybarra: and a big thanks to him!  |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: This is the last board of the 1st out of 8 segments, next will start in 1hour from now (13:45 local time) Hope this time everything will be fine and all can be broadcasted. Thanks ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: all for joining us here and specialy the commentators!|pg||
nt|drewsky: Peter.....may I ask you..what card would have played as south if you held the ace of @D ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the set    interesting set|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: last board of this set now|pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+|nt|vugraphznt: Grue telling 4@D was making after this auction, guessing the @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: USA   plenty to do   but still a long way to go|pg||
mb|1D!|an|weak|nt|petergill: The investment in advanced bidding technique by Brink and Drijver, compared to the natural American auction, was the main reason for that swing. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|16-18|nt|ady: bad lay for 4@H  e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) 0-8 HCP  b) 9+ HCP 0-1 Controls [A=2 K=1]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will bid game I would think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=16-18|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: this looks like 4@H i agree david|pg||
nt|ady: J@H    best lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Harold   and thx all and kibs|pg||
nt|roswolf: although west does only have a 9 count|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the set    thx all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  3rd vul & always 4th|pg||
nt|warrens:  a nice squeeze on the previous hand for an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ady: kib suggested 3NT       but that also should fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a little too much testosterone i think|pg||
nt|ady: might get a diamond loser on 3rd spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Unsure about meanings|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: now @d7 is count - odd number|pg||
nt|warrens:  needed to start with a @C, but most players avoid leading from Axxx against NT|pg||
nt|ady: if north comes in with A@C   will likely switch to a spade   and south will probably cash out for down 1|pg||
nt|ady: thx Gerbrand    thx all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Gerbrabd   and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: next set will be in 1 hr from now, at 13.45 local time|pg||
nt|petergill: so I would chalk those Dutch imps down to Team Orange's training and the investment by Hans Melchers or Mr Drexelford(?) or whoever created the Team Orange training concept in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Netherlands|pg||
nt|ady: clu ruff beats 4@S  |pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set of the day begins in about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  since S has all the entries, this should make easily|pg||
nt|ady: or win and switch to clubs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: Justin Lall tried lead of @SA|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 30: The golden rule of expert bridge is to trust partner, not the opponents. Thus, when N is faced with a choice between two impossibilities, he must trust partner, not the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: opponent who appears to have pulled out the wrong bidding card (went for 4@S and accidentally bid 6@S off two aces) |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rhelle: As south, you can 'see' that North must have a virtual yarborough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems normal to shift to @Cx|pg||
nt|petergill: low club now looks normal to me|pg||
nt|petergill: too|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry @c loser|pg||
nt|petergill: Then @DQ - king ..... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: many specs also pointing out @D ruffing finesse to ditch 3rd @C|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like more imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more sets in Senior Bowl and Venice Cup    Bermuda Bowl plays 2 more today and 2 sets tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinking about @H2|pg||
nt|ady: might do it by ruffing out K@D  and coming back with a heart and discarding a club in east hand|pg||
nt|petergill: if North ducks @DQ in normal tempo (unlikely, normal is to cover in case S has the jack), then |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: great analyst  says  "thus, ACE and a club may get declarer to misguess who has the doubleton"|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|ady: Netherlands have made a nice recovery   |pg||
nt|roswolf: what happened there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Grue smoothly ducked @CA...|pg||
nt|ady: slip up    but should still be -1   if no other mistake|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: this looks flat  so of for some lunch     thx    all    bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can/should make shouldnt it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "@CA, @C, @D ruffout, @HA, @D for a pitch, @S to jack DUCKED..."|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bbramley: so this should be 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a likely push |pg||
nt|bbramley: thx everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: see you all in about 1 hour |pg||
nt|bbramley: i'm told other room is in 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 3 nt at the other table |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i could see stuff like that |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: for the kibs who does think this score indicates a win by the Dutch pls do not forget we only played half of the match (64 out of 128)|pg||
nt|ady: another swing for Netherlands   a cvery fgood set|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|petergill: @DA play at Trick 1 suggested N had @DK, so club switch would not have beaten this, I think|pg||

nt|ady: cash diamond and J@C|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|pg||
