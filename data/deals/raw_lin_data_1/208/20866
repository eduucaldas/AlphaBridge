nt|vugraphznx: Here we go again|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: actually the score is 66 to 81, but the operator in the OR didn t recieve that message before starting the broadcast|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@h anyone?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|grebrof: maybe too weak at these colours|pg||
nt|kit: it sure looks a lot closer to a 3@H opening than to a pass|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree|pg||
nt|grebrof: this time S maybe lucky as N will at some point show some strength|pg||
nt|kit: The somewhat off-shape 1NT opening will present problems for everybody.|pg||
nt|grebrof: Im maybe oldfashioned - that is not a 1nt for me|pg||
nt|kit: of course opening 1 of either minor leaves you with an uncomfortable rebid.|pg||
mb|d!|mb|2S|an|!c|nt|grebrof: playing bridge is uncomfortable at times, yes|pg||
nt|kit: The double appears to be penalties -- which is consistent with Robinson's 2@S call as natural|pg||
nt|kit: Although one might think he would prefer to play in clubs|pg||
nt|grebrof: alerted as @cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: 2@s = transfer to @c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: oh, sorry -- 2@S shows clubs|pg||
nt|kit: Well, Boyd will bid 5@C then|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kit: And it is up to Leenhardt|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult to bid 5@H with clearly worthless king of clubs|pg||
nt|grebrof: from Ns point of view, S maybe didnt preemt because holding both majors|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|grebrof: well, how useless is it? the strong hand is at W|pg||
nt|kit: Good choice, salvaging the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: And Boyd may fall from grace and double|pg||
nt|grebrof: bidding 6@c would be lucky anyway - depends on what agreement they have /if any / considering Robinsons ass|pg||
nt|grebrof: pass|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine he will bid 6@C with this much defense|pg||
nt|grebrof: :S|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt either|pg||
nt|kit: if he doubles, East will pass without giving it a second thought.|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: East has promised nothing.  He assumes West has it beat in his own hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|grebrof: looks like 5 imps for the french team|pg||
nt|kit: I admit I probably would have doubled also on Boyd's hand.  They aren't making any overtricks, and could easily be down 2.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||

mb|p|nt|hlortz: ns missed a chance to get some IMPs back but no one had a clear X of 4@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hallo Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: so,if lasserre wants to show both his suits at once he has to bid 3@c|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: so a few imps for some overtricks on Board 1|pg||
nt|mug: sorry it's 1.5 IMPs, so England win the ties|pg||
nt|ritong: boyd has a clearcut 2@c overcall  robinson's reaction is interesting to observe|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Hi Mike, any news on the ruling from the last set? Julian|pg||
nt|mamos: an aggressive t/o double from East |pg||
nt|mamos: as we would expect|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|hlortz: here we had a pretty routine texas to 4@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North sure to come again|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c showed @s & @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this inv migth lead -to 4 @h -2 if they find ! ruff|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS will just see how many of their "winners" will cash|pg||
nt|westjava: good save in 5@D|pg||
nt|mug: correction direct from Aylesbury on that point, Barry's giving them time off to watch the match|pg||
nt|grebrof: mostly for kids, but someone never grow up - guilty|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: when playing @hQ Leenhardt played cQ instead of @hj|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Sally Brock's 2NT shows a good @S raise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H i mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with 4+ in @H|pg||
nt|farfie: un solide 4@h|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hlortz: just overtricks at stake - time to get some tea :)|pg||
nt|mug: Heather might have reopened with a take-out double here|pg||
nt|farfie: 11 levées sur la place du roi de @d|pg||
pc|h8|nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: boyd estimates that his shape is more adapted to a suit contract|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this looks pretty difficult to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S losers and can only afford 1 @C loser|pg||
nt|ahalim: can prubaly make on an endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: run the @c 9 after eliminating @s and @d looks best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can maybe eliminate @S and @D |pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room Dhondy led J@C |pg||
nt|grebrof: Q of h!?|pg||
nt|grebrof: no|pg||
nt|ritong: he might even finesse @d 9, for the fun|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|alnanda: 1S LOSSER DISCRAD WITH q@D|pg||
nt|mug: 2NT was minors, also fairly reasonable but swapping plus for minus|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: at some point in the game|pg||
nt|mamos: several specs ask about the ruling from the last set   does anyone onsite know the outcome|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Heather too busy but everyone bids more than me|pg||
nt|mug: lucky not to be bigger minus, both South and North might have got hold of 3@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|don_kapu: what a brave bidding|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but 3nt look like will make|pg||
nt|grebrof: whe n your P opens and you have a 6  card mjor suit, I find no defense not bidding them at the 3 level  - esprcialy holding the A|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mug: Nevena would have left a double in, 2@S is one off|pg||
pc|h7|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
nt|szalay: 2 or 3 off|pg||
nt|henryb:  This seems to be down 2 |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahalim: but decl might place the @CK with W because of the overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the discard doesnt do much good except aid the elimination|pg||
nt|ritong: really|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mug: but I can imagine Heather feeling that defending doubled partials was not the way to go at the score|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT a more attractive spot than 3D - perhaps pass by East was better option|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yorkbeach:  system card for EW http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
nt|mamos: Club lead will allow trump promotion|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kit: The weak 2 may get them to game -- defense must lead or shift to club to defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: right -- E-W have to not cash AK of diamonds, as that sets up 2 discards.|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 2NT probably some ask.  South doesn't have it, it looks like, whatever it asks for|pg||
nt|grebrof: shifting after A of  @h isnt good enough either - I guess 3@s is minimum|pg||

nt|rmb1: Another potential 3NT?  EW may not bid at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: W didnt do well actually|pg||
nt|mug: took some defending though, the defenders need to clear their club trick before declarer sets up the long heart|pg||
nt|szalay: easy looking 4@H is coming|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 8 out of the blue|pg||
nt|ritong: promising hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  And South wins and leads trump|pg||
nt|ritong: and at that point he has to double hook @cs directly, no?|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: you can play the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|ahalim: alas we shall never know|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: means running @c9 afterwards @cQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  An unfriendly hand for N-S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Both black Ks offside|pg||
mb|1H|nt|runnerup: makeable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double only cost 3 imps and was worth the possible psychological gain if it worked|pg||
nt|ritong: can t know what they have agreed about 4@h as opposed to 4Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: why would you do that unless you see all the cards?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: dropping W s jack|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: a alm here 6nt /@d /@c |pg||
nt|runnerup: slam|pg||
nt|rmb1: I was wrong about adverse vulnerabilty silencing EW :)|pg||

nt|szalay: I doubt US could gain in this style|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|runnerup: some misunderstanding perhaps|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: the 3@D response was constructive, with a bust he would have bid a lebensohl 2nt|pg||
nt|hlortz: dummy's trump are a bit disappointing but we can see that the aggressive style from usa2 has paid well --so far|pg||
nt|mug: good afternoon Jack|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D is xfer, no doubt|pg||
nt|grebrof: for e 5@h is obvious - whoo has @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 5 ruffs and 2 aces?|pg||
nt|rmb1: The first set will has shown that there will be a battle on every hand in this match, no chance to relax|pg||
nt|mug: E-W are playing strong notrump, 5-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: W just didn t open ;)|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|runnerup: timing has not been best possible -when game is on you are in partial and wise versus|pg||

nt|mamos: defence have four tricks if they can organise |pg||
pc|s9|nt|lontoh 63: hi all|pg||

nt|rmb1: South must have something for her double: so North could play a trump to @HA|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West has to hod her cards up and of course not fly with q of diamonds- oops|pg||

nt|ahalim: made in the end :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello|pg||
nt|mug: so noone has anything in the locker, just 13 more board of bridge, we think Arifin?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H from West? |pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@S C turned back to 4@S + 2 |pg||
nt|szalay: btw 2nd trump by South instead of @C wd be stronger defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: this was black start from n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: commentator please|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes tricky - because if North bids clubs strongly, NS are likely to finish in 5@c rather than 4@h|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mamos: in the OR the Indonesians played the first three tricks in the way needed to defeat  -- but then West continued Spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: that|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H not exactly classical with four spades on the side, but what do you suggest?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|szalay: practice 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: this kind of hand generates a lot of accidents|pg||
mb|d|nt|runnerup: here normal handling in 1s lead to 12 tricks in @h (or nt ,but that is wrong contract)|pg||
nt|hlortz: well suit quality of weak 2's has gone down over the years|pg||
nt|wstuart: A common treatment is to play 4@S as a strong single suited hand after a weak 2 opening.|pg||
nt|henryb:  A not unreasonable 3N for N-S, needing mostly the heart finesse, which is offside|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hlortz: martel will likely buy it for 4@S -1|pg||
nt|wstuart: That looks likely.|pg||
nt|ritong: it is really good looking, for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: but the obvious danger is to drive too high|pg||
nt|henryb:  X = 3 card heart support|pg||
nt|farfie: bonne idée de Guy Lasserre,ce contre d'entame|pg||
nt|jjsb2: bonjour tout le monde :) |pg||
nt|farfie: bonsoir Sylvain|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: in @s|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and all pass for 2@S|pg||
nt|ahalim: only half an imp extra for England, which the program cannot show|pg||
nt|jjsb2: c'est docn parti pour une mi temps probablement haletante et pleine de rebondissement ! |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: an excellent bid of 3NT, some players would double but you don't really want to heart partner bid clubs, let alone diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok for me but I bet that there will be some 4H bidders|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok turned back to 5@S +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: io so cape maklum lah ....... kondisi begini yang kuat stamina yang bisa main bagus ,tapi sama2 US juga pasti so cape |pg||
nt|ahalim: omg a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not always nice to play in a 3-3 fit |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if EW had bid and raised @d, East might lead the @d2 as suit preference|pg||
nt|ritong: so, as long as pard is not a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: my policy with these is to take low road|pg||
nt|farfie: l'entame "naturelle" à !k donne une surlevée|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mug: declarer should cash @CA at trick two, plain sailing from there|pg||

nt|jjsb2: en passant un grand bravo aux femmes qui ont gagne la competition "venice cup" à 16 donnes de la fin |pg||
nt|jjsb2: bref ... :)|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ici lasserre a cotnre 3@h est donc poizat est normalement obeissant |pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup: partner opened and you had 19 hcp -may lead to slam|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphznx: will have to put in the scores manually|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a more straightforward make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting choice by declarer in the @h suit|pg||
nt|ritong: surprising choice|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps the support double more or less infers long opening suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  rather than 2N?|pg||
nt|ritong: or double|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|wstuart: Not much to te play on this one I think.|pg||
nt|ahalim: for people who are interested in the score per session of this match|pg||
nt|farfie: bonne nouvelle:5imps tombent dans notre escarcelle |pg||
nt|jjsb2: le cotnrat n''est pas tres claire a joue , les communications sont un peu bizarre |pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphznx: + 2?|pg||
nt|ritong: sticking to hcp|pg||
pc|hA|nt|runnerup: @d was missed by ew -but it can happen in many secvenses -|pg||
nt|yo_yo: happens a lot when 1NT forcing and west is forced to rebid longest minor|pg||
nt|mamos: easier for us of course because we know Spade honours onside|pg||
nt|blewah: hi Pak Arifin. is this the official score?|pg||
nt|mug: Smith made the maximum in the CR, so declarer has to pin the @S10 or manage some kind of endplay to flatten the board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now should start spades from dummy or Ace and small spade|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps @DK next to guarantee the contract?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes Q of spades works but swop Ace of diamonds and spade king and a bad idea|pg||
nt|ritong: for once:)|pg||
nt|ritong: meaning " i want to stay in, but no clear path"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lontoh 63: don't know how many degree on there but though cold now|pg||
nt|mamos: but looks like making even if declarer loses a trump a Heart and a Club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to decipher the NS leads - presumably declarer knew the @hQ was offside|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|farfie: plus que 8 points à refaire|pg||
nt|farfie: le déclarant n'est pas arrivé...|pg||
nt|jjsb2: en fait j'ai tendance a pense , peut etre a tort, que le coup ne gagne pas |pg||
nt|jjsb2: le meilleur jeu est peut etre pour le declarant de jouer R de T |pg||
nt|jjsb2: mais 1) ke ne trouve pas ca naturel et 2 je ne pense pas que cela suffise |pg||
nt|farfie: oui ça coupe les communications|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on me dit que R de T permet de gagner j'ai perso un gros dotue|pg||
nt|jjsb2: si on duque le R notamment |pg||
nt|farfie: certes|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ritong: how do you like that, stevie?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: East might have bid 2@D though|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos: now presumably a @d and a trump up|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|runnerup: all boards have been flat so far |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 81-66 is the score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you have opened arifin?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2 imps missing for Indonesia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit weak for me to open|pg||
nt|ahalim: with West;s cards ? No|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they seem to lead the 9 from Q-10-9 - zero or two higher leads|pg||
pc|cK|nt|grebrof: I rarely seem my P open 2! with such week @h and no distribution - also - dbl with no tricks in trumps I have seen many disastres|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: cant avoid heart ruff now - had to play 3rd heart before trumps|pg||

nt|jjsb2: il est peut etre possible d'intervenir a  cette vulnerabilite avec la main d'Est egalement |pg||
nt|farfie: je pence que Philippe Poizat aurait du intervenir à @d dans cette position de vulnérabilité...il doit se reprocher le coup précédent|pg||
nt|farfie: pense|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ici pour le coup comme on peut tous le coir 3@h ne joue pas "tres bien" |pg||
nt|jjsb2: je suis d'accord dominique |pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: Now West opens her 10 count and |pg||
nt|ritong: this @h 7 seems to come from blank suit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: 3 @h could have and would have been -2 ,but not a place to pass for west -very difficult place |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I think he will finesse in @d|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not really|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: S then must have had @hA|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but it would create a 2nd entry to dummy|pg||
nt|westjava: will they reach to 6?|pg||
nt|hlortz: cue bids here...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@C is likely a control bid in that suit, however, it may show a min range in HCP;  they may play a serious 3NT which would show more HCP and then let opener continue the auction.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahalim: evrybody starts bidding :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 11 seems a lot of tricks in OR|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on me dit que l'enchere de 3@h est "douteuse" ... je suis aussi d'accord |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: when it s not a possible fourth best|pg||
nt|ritong: however, it can be a "forced" lead, so Q87 remains possible|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West will regret opening in a minute|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3@H was likely an ask for further description.|pg||
nt|ahalim: remember the Dutch ladies won the venice cup by 0,5 imp some years ago in bermuda|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on est intervenu par 3@d a l'autre table , je suis a peine surpris |pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very aggressive bidding in Open room|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, no first control in @C I think|pg||
nt|farfie: il aurait mieux valu effectivement attendre un éventuel réveil du partenaire|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: we have no official communication on the ruling 6@s was bid at both tables on Board ?  in the last stanza  by the Indonesians after a slow 5@S bid I think and England asked for a ...|pg||
nt|mamos: ruling|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: forced lead means that east might have @ss or @cs and be unwilling to lead in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|grebrof: good lead it was|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hlortz: 4n/5c 0/3 and 5@D asking Q@S 6@C yes to Q plus k@C|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|mug: this is going to at least make to 2 more IMPs to Indonesia|pg||
nt|szalay: may be South was afraid tha his partner pulls|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|wstuart: Looks like this is going down on the only lead to beat it.  This may swing some IMPs.|pg||
nt|hlortz: 6s looks a bit tricky with a @H lead u need to unblock @C shed a @H then...|pg||
nt|mamos: 10 tricks for West|pg||
pc|cT|nt|runnerup: not very many imps chances in this either -all thougth lead gave extra trick |pg||
nt|odysseus69: here West had close decision and might wel have passed 3C|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|farfie: il s'en sort au mieux là|pg||
nt|jjsb2: !t maintenant et je pense qu'on s'en "sort " à -2 si je vois bien |pg||
pc|d9|nt|yorkbeach:  it was a RKCB sequence on the ruling and an ask for the trump queen|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahalim: is that typical from Sally and Nicola ?|pg||

nt|kit: I'm not so sure I would either.  |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: Partner will bid again if there is anything.|pg||
nt|grebrof: the upside is that you have length in your Ps suit (@H)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: In the closed room E-W did manage to stop in 3@C, so the match will likely tighten up.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: yes, this time he would, but maybe also assume a better hand at E|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|grebrof: well, Robinson probably did :)|pg||

nt|westjava: ok:)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|runnerup: 5 1c really makes ,but i doubt that they will bid less |pg||
nt|ahalim: slam time, this time not so difficult to bid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 6@S or 6@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: she claimed for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5@C hinges on the guess in @D |pg||
nt|yo_yo: DEwi shows both majors|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S do you think?|pg||
nt|mamos: there may of course be an appeal  we don't know but at present England lead by 11 more imps than is shown here|pg||
nt|jjsb2: je ne suis perso pas pour l'intervention à 1@s mais je suppose que c'est une question de style |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 5 @c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think she lost 2 hearts 1 spade and 1 club|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: i believe Stockdale said wrong card|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and nicola will bid  what|pg||
nt|jjsb2: avec des adversaires parlant autant peut etre allons nous echapper a ce cotnrat de 3Sa mort ne ? |pg||
mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: once North flew with heart ace there was 9 tricks|pg||
nt|alnanda: lost 2@h, 1@s,1@c and ruff @d|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now the road to 6@H or 6@S is opened wide after a 4@D bidding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: X might indicate @H suit|pg||
mb|d!|nt|dgame: 7@d for -5|pg||
nt|szalay: another boring game, 5@Cx=500|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 150 looks very normal here|pg||
nt|alnanda: 7@d :) ??|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: alternate option was stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: but sporty|pg||
mb|p|nt|alnanda: -6|pg||
nt|grebrof: french people are strange Henri - you always wear brown scarfs :D|pg||
nt|henryb:  The French N-S assayed 3N on board 4, goung down 2 when the heart was offsude|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on m'envoie 100 messages me disant que c'est obligatoire .. je n'en doute pas ... |pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: e did not open in OR so 4@S escaped w/o X|pg||
nt|wstuart: -2 looks about right here.|pg||
nt|ritong: stayman followed with 2@s is an invite for them i think  north a bit short|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: only 6 down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|alnanda: for 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maximum 6 down = 1400|pg||
nt|mug: very aggressive upgrade by Heather Dhondy, the five-card suit is good but the stiff A-K not so good|pg||
nt|mug: decent contract but the minors lie badly |pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and we have bread under our arm all the time|pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
nt|jjsb2: piganeau l'a egalement faite pour info |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahalim: this bidding is truly worthclass level|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who will Nicola play for @D?|pg||
nt|hlortz: maybe -1...|pg||

nt|runnerup: some overbid  -but that happens -even 4 @s is down - also 5 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: E deeply in thought|pg||
nt|mamos: The English NS pushed EW uncomfortably high here but 5@S made seems like a push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in the OR NS competed to the 5-level at the favourable vul but EW judged successfully to bid 5@s|pg||
nt|anton72: need a minor shift now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahalim: when E shows up with the @S A, Nicola will guess the @D;s I think|pg||
nt|grebrof: you make good bread thou . almost as good as the danish|pg||
pc|d4|nt|blewah: @d return to force a guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: WEst made a vulnerable bid so is maybe favoute to have ace|pg||
pc|dA|nt|runnerup: in 4 @s defence should be like @h  lead -@s to Ace and @c .to beat it|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahalim: worlclass|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on shapely deals like this, having more aces is important|pg||
nt|mug: not sure this was good for the defence|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahalim: Ok next board please|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes WD nicola|pg||
nt|blewah: well done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the OR  Dhondy led A@D  so no guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nicola will claim when the next lead isnt ruffed|pg||
nt|ritong: with @h K on he will lose three trumps and basta|pg||
nt|ritong: at most|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahalim: this can make if you guess everything right|pg||

nt|anton72: double dummy say ...yes ..:)|pg||

nt|anton72: still -1|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 2 aces to come and make all 6 trumps on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: so still a long way to go in this match 10 more boards here and 16 more in the final stanza - with the teams turning over between three and four imps a board still very much ...|pg||
nt|mamos: anyone's match|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 3Sa a l'autre table pour info , entame @s |pg||
pc|s2|nt|wstuart: Looks like the @D spots are going to get crushed out and he will only lose 3 @D tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|blewah: not an obvious shift but that's the weakest suit on the table|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mug: I think a spade back might have been logical, to kill entries to dummy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|grebrof: not being able to opening 1nt with 5card major, will in many times give you rebid problems|pg||
nt|jjsb2: qui devrait etre a -1 ou moins 2 selon qu'on mette le V de @s ou pas |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|anton72: she can guess 4 cards in partner and i am agree ...diamond looks more normal not J @c|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dgame: 2 imps|pg||
nt|wstuart: After the Q to the K and teh J to the A, he will have to guess whether the 8 or the T is coming down next.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphznx: she cashed some diamonds first|pg||

nt|kit: North would like to be able to bid 3NT again.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: if i am not mistaken in one side was alerted diamonds but South alerted as club fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: probably @ds and @cs then|pg||
nt|kit: Opening lead against 5 of a minor could be critical.  Defense may lose their ace of spades if they don't cash it.|pg||
nt|kit: And it is hard to imagine anything but a heart being led from either side.|pg||
nt|kit: Well, Robinson might lay down ace of spades vs. 5@C.  Boyd will certainly lead a heart vs. 5@D.|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - vs 5@c, you might want to cash your @s ace|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: even now its possible|pg||
nt|kit: This is good for france, unless Boyd finds an inspired spade lead.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Now declarer can take ruffing finesse in hearts to get rid of losing spade, and then one diamond lead from dummy will pick up trump suit with 1 loser.|pg||

nt|kit: Leenhardt would like to make penalty double, but I doubt if that is what it would mean.|pg||
nt|grebrof: that was Ns plan too I guess|pg||
nt|kit: He may just bid 3NT, which appears to come home on power.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Now the big decision -- double or 3NT works very well|pg||
nt|grebrof: I always make the same "joke" when I am void in my Ps trumpsuit: "A good P always has trumps" - its very valid for EW here|pg||
nt|kit: At other table 3@C got passed on similar auction, so chance for pickup for France|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|grebrof: I think N should dbl - P enters and IF he doesnt have any @c, but @d - S will bid 3@d|pg||
nt|kit: Most play that if North doubles 3@C it is takeout, I believe|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: Edgtton that is|pg||

nt|szalay: to be honest never erasy to bid slam when opponents start with 1N, strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 5@H|pg||

mb|2C|nt|lontoh 63: somebody tell me that D. Rosenberg does not belong in this competition ..... any reason for this.|pg||

nt|szalay: is 5@C exclusion here?|pg||
nt|szalay: or spl? or nat?|pg||
nt|ritong: right spot is 6@c, icecold when trumps2/2|pg||

nt|mug: but I think you can make it if you need to|pg||

pc|h4|pc|c3|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: settled for 10 for push|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  what happened on the ruling was that NS had a RKCB sequence. South showed 1 key card. North asked for the trump queen. South denied it but there was a hesitation involved. North then bid the slam.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: South held Jxxx|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so had to judge whether that was as good as the Q|pg||

nt|westjava: every body so tired there|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the operator in the OR just had some difficulties during the bidding :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, South bid 1NT rather than double, so she does not have spades, and North bid the minors so she does not have spades|pg||

pc|h6|nt|dburn:  so maybe East has spades, unless the dealing machine has eaten them all|pg||
pc|hK|nt|alnanda: still down, but must perfect defense |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: this is going to be passed out :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed it was, though I would have thought East could bid 3@s|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: defence better be careful - as long as West ducks first diamond East can warn partner off spade return|pg||
nt|don_kapu: according to my brother hood, this is pancake board (flat board)|pg||
nt|westjava: @S9 lead other room|pg||
nt|ahalim: I think blewah shd become operator once|pg||
nt|westjava: tied money policy, moneter crisis, don|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as a passed hand, South cannot be much better than she is. who would be bidding 2@c rather than 1NT?|pg||
nt|grebrof: nonvul vs vul probably more temting|pg||
nt|jjsb2: je pense que As de @d et @d vient probablement assez bien ici mais je suis influence par les jeux |pg||
nt|farfie: petit @d serait terrible..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|don_kapu: flat board|pg||
nt|dburn:  still time to take plenty of tricks for the defenders|pg||
pc|d2|nt|alnanda: Q@h !!|pg||
nt|jjsb2: cela dit il y a quand meme pas mal de cas assez simple ou cela fait chuter .. |pg||
pc|d5|nt|blewah: raising directly @c would have work better, it seems|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|blewah: i don't think i would be strong enough to do it oom Arifin|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe 1 imp for England|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok then pls don't say operator's error|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe the toughest job in bridge|pg||
nt|westjava: agreed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|westjava: btw, live score : USA-2 Senior leads 228.5 - 174 VP vs Ina Senior|pg||
nt|westjava: senior live score : http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=QF&qroundno=1&qtournid=887|pg||
nt|don_kapu: so our opa2 now must be sleep beauty|pg||
nt|jjsb2: idem a l'autre table , segment de tres bon niveau malgre une fatigue probable de tout les joueurs |pg||
nt|ritong: il y a bien 128 donnes au programme? je demande confirmation, car le bandeau annonce 6/6|pg||
nt|jjsb2: je confirme que c'est le dernier segment |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: oui c est la derniere seance du senior|pg||
nt|ritong: merci|pg||
nt|ritong: ça pulse a donf, alors|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: not clear message unless that was suit pref for hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the lead suggests that clubs will break - else a cub lead|pg||
nt|jjsb2: un petit coup de 1imp Henri :) |pg||
pc|d7|nt|odysseus69: now a massacre|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok small children are not allowed to watch this|pg||
nt|dgame: dewi was really a tough girl|pg||
nt|westjava: fasten your seat belt pls|pg||
nt|dgame: hard to breath|pg||
nt|blewah: prohibiting EW entering the auction. but 3@c is not an option|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South would have liked her @h honours but the the singleton in partner's suit|pg||
nt|blewah: while 4@c or 5@c risk missing 3NT|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|blewah: I didn't say it Oom|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|mug: my open room correspondent tells me Smith and Brock are not in slam on the previous board|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: ça ne fâche pas|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: having decided to open 1D I dont think South should volunteer 2D - pass would simply show a minimum with long diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: is declarer going to ruff some @S?|pg||
nt|blewah: @d lead holds this to 10 tricks only|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dT|pc|sK|nt|westjava: they still have Trans National event|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  yes South will be expecting North to be short in @h rather than @s|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|dburn:  well, maybe - but the opponents are not bidding like people with eight hearts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|alnanda: welldone :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
mc|9|nt|dburn:  so North ought to be at worsr 2=2=5=4|pg||

nt|kit: For those who prefer leading 3-card suits to 4-card suits vs. 3NT, this deal will be a strong argument for their case.|pg||
nt|kit: same spade lead at other table.  So France will maintain their small lead with 4 deals to go.  The tension mounts.|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think they win more often than the 4/5card leaders too!|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: after some time :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: what is the infraction ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: N: " I psyched"|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the director is asking NS about their psyching habits|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: okay, they are continuing|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I will tell you the results, when the director is entering again|pg||
nt|westjava: teams KO from semi finals play in Transnational : http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=884|pg||
nt|grebrof: I still would lead @s . you need 5 @cs with P or 4 good ones and 2 entries|pg||
nt|ritong: first clear good board for USA|pg||
nt|jjsb2: je fait reference à cette demi finale .. pour ceux qui ont suivi ... qui c'est joue sur la derniere donne pour gagner de 1IMP , en fait 0,33imp...|pg||
nt|jjsb2: apparemment une donne sans encombre ici |pg||
mb|p|nt|dgame: "plong"|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on joue 3Sa à l'autre table |pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  at this level you can place a degree of confidence in what the opponents are doing|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphznx: they will play for 3rd place|pg||
nt|dburn:  here is another possible game in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn:  but so far no one has bid those except West|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tough to find after West bid the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb2: mais sans encombre est bien sur de trop .. tout les IMP vont comptes , c'est certains ! |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  this game didn't have to make at the other table, did it?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: a playoff that is with less boards than the finals|pg||
nt|westjava: u r right Paul, the others I mean|pg||
nt|dburn:  South may have a chance now, if 3@c is natural (as it should be)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North has the right sort of shape to X 2@s but not enough values|pg||
nt|mamos: south might dbl and N bid Clubs|pg||
nt|mug: I wonder why Dhondy didn't upgrade this hand to an opening 1NT?|pg||
nt|grebrof: good bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: si ils nous refont le plan de la demi finale, je prendrai quelques jours de repos|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn:  I guess it did, once South led a spade|pg||
nt|alnanda: @s lead|pg||
nt|blewah: what is 3@s?|pg||
nt|farfie: je ne pense pas qu'ils vont entamer ça,dans l'autre salle|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn:  but North had not opened, so South didn't know what to lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but about 1,000 IMPs have been lost in this tournament so far by people who cannot bid the opponents' non-suits naturally|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: and having bid 2D South should run when doubled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I would be tempted to save with the east hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: N shaking her head, she didn t want to alert 3@s :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: most likely go drn, but|pg||
nt|ritong: good chances of a duplicated auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so, gathering maximum of tricks in order  making it not that relevant|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|blewah: i see|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: i think that  pass by S   "timid"|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West's 1@c is either clubs or a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  and that, in times when both 1@c and 1@d are frequently short suits, is really not very sensible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would get an alert where I play|pg||
nt|szalay: gotta go, bye all|pg||
nt|ritong: presumably 2@d shows 5@h when 2@h would show 6+|pg||
nt|jjsb2: oui pardon j'ai dit sans encombre en considerant que l'entame @h ne venait pas "facilement"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jjsb2: entame @s à l'autre table |pg||
pc|d4|nt|blewah: unfavorable vulnerability. a bit conservative maybe by S, though|pg||
nt|ritong: now the toughes part  make it|pg||
nt|ritong: toughest*|pg||
nt|ritong: finding @hs was tough already|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mug: ah well, they got there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: didnt do so well last time- does that affect her?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|alnanda: next world championship 2013, Indonesia to host , we must prepare ourselves as organizers and achievement|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|dburn:  well, maybe. But if East had held the ace of clubs and West the ace of hearts, 3NT doubled would have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well maybe East would have led a heart - we can maybe all day - I am too old and cowardly to want to be in 3NTx on the N/S cards |pg||
nt|dburn:  oh, I don't say I would want to be in it either - I am also an old coward|pg||
pc|dK|nt|farfie: bon...tant pais|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|farfie: pis|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|westjava: yes sir! we get ready!:)|pg||
nt|ritong: situation is supermurky for shermer  the @c 8 is not readable|pg||
nt|ritong: schermer  sry|pg||
nt|ritong: if it was, he would have underlead his @d A confidently|pg||
nt|ritong: underled*|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, i do not think the contract can be beaten up to that point|pg||
nt|ritong: not by technical ways, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: despite the fact that this @c Jack mighta been useful as en entry to @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: board 10 proved too difficult for americans as well no (big) swing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  card says 1+@c|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: that how it went|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahalim: hey hey peace on earth|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: Nicola will be expecting bad breaks from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: schermer: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: schermer::(|pg||
nt|ritong: pard has the darn @d K, but poof|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: i talk about lasserre's state of mind|pg||
nt|ritong: his prebalancing action is obvious, imho, and contract will very likely be the same next room|pg||
nt|ritong: so will be the opening lead, at first sight|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|odysseus69: on the other hand I am in the camp which advocates an opening bid on North so no sympathy when passing costs game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|blewah: ruff out some @ds would be my line, can go to hand with trump|pg||
nt|blewah: to table, I mean|pg||
nt|westjava: Venice other SF, France leads 84 - 46.5 imps vs Netherland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the x ruff will work as it happens|pg||
nt|ritong: so his target is to make as many tricks as reasonably possible, then compare scores|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 6 imp ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might have reopened wih 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn:  they will have a singleton only when 4=4=4=1 precisely - but they will have a doubleton quite a lot of the time|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mug: some pairs simply don't open 1NT with a 5-card majors, for example the three pairs on the Italian open team|pg||
mc|10|nt|westjava: Bali waiting all of us|pg||
nt|blewah: they are becoming minority day by day, i think|pg||
nt|blewah: as 5M332 is gaining popularity all over the world|pg||
nt|blewah: for 1nt, I mean|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|grebrof: but ok - 3 more boards to go|pg||

nt|grebrof: maybe I should start biting my nails then - this IS very exciting|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H!|an|7-9 4!s|nt|kit: N-S can make 4@H if they guess the queen of clubs -- maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: yeah - I meant after this :P|pg||
nt|kit: E-W can make only 3@S in theory -- In practice, might make 4|pg||
nt|grebrof: a @c lead isnt very unlikely either|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kit: Well, they aren't playing 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Careful defense will defeat 4@S, but there could be some slippage|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H would definitely go down on stiff club lead -- if declarer draws trumps he loses 2 spades, if he doesn't, defense gets club ruff.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: But same 4@S contract in other room.|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree with Boyds 4@s |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|kit: so do I.  You don't hang one trick short of game with a hand like that when partner makes an invitational raise.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: 10 of diamonds lead in closed room, which will make the defense even simpler|pg||
pc|s6|nt|grebrof: his P could have had the KQ of @c with the @S-cut on etc - or maybe even 5@h making, and 4@s makes it hard for them to get there|pg||
nt|kit: Nothing for declarer to do but work on clubs, hoping for AKx, a defensive error, or a veery unlikely squeeze.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|kit: Probably right play -- hoping to panic North into going up king from, say, KJxxx.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||

nt|don_kapu: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Netherlands leading by 3 against Italy...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but somehow hasn'tcost|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  this is a slam more or less flat out on a finesse|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 1@h opening and what will E doing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1D x is the start - but where it ends?|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: ok pass|pg||
nt|dburn:  not the most exciting set of boards, this - but with the match as close as it is, a couple of part-score swings could well decide the issue|pg||
mb|1H|nt|westjava: dbl by w?|pg||
nt|blewah: weak raise|pg||

nt|ritong: il ne peut donc rien arriver de mauvais|pg||
mb|4S|nt|westjava: hard to bid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 7@D always loose 1@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even in third seat, South opens with her poor 12|pg||
nt|blewah: 1@d by S?|pg||
nt|mug: 1@D was nebulous so South was put off trying 2@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: welldune|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I don't think you have to get to 4@s(which went close)|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: can u keep it|pg||
nt|blewah: now all she has to do is make it|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but i think E has drink a little blood of dragon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say  for the @D suit|pg||
nt|dburn:  low to the jack is normal|pg||
nt|westjava: so, the new leader, again?|pg||
nt|ritong: @s K does not look good, and @h xxx not a bonus|pg||
nt|grebrof: I gues 3@s also how @Hs - not my style, but you better play the sam as your partmrt|pg||
nt|ritong: @s K does not look good because opponents presumably hold nine of them, therefore it will not be an active card  better be elsewhere|pg||
nt|ritong: now choice is restricted:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: if east has somrthing left to offer. he bids again - does he?|pg||
nt|ritong: he makes me sweating|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|odysseus69: dreaded slam on finesse board - my pet hate|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this is worse if @c led|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Rolands law- bid it when right  dont when wrong|pg||
nt|dgame: dewi is digging it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in reality a fractin less than 50% - 6-1 club break - not massive - reduces it a fraction|pg||
nt|blewah: N could have tried 2@c though|pg||
nt|blewah: 54+ in minors|pg||
nt|ianmcc: best to settle for -200|pg||
nt|ianmcc: take 6@d & @c|pg||
nt|ritong: on voit pas pourquoài il ferait ça, non plus|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ils sont pas marrant les americains , ils ne font pas les choses qu'ils ne devraient pas faire :) |pg||

nt|ritong: être derrière au score|pg||
nt|ritong: pourvu que ça dure, dit il en toute impartialité|pg||
nt|jjsb2: le declarant va probablement essayer de trouve AKx chez l"ouveur à @c |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|westjava: ABCC in Bali 2012 is open tournament|pg||
nt|westjava: so, this board will be push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South did not fancy a weak NT in third seat vulnerable with 12 - not sure of the logic for preferring 1@d to 1C though|pg||
nt|blewah: yes to some questions, NS play weak NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn:  but on this auction North is marked with the king|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: good start for declarer - can switch to spades now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mamos: nonetheless NS find themselves in a pretty good spot|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  possible pick up for Indonesia|pg||
nt|ianmcc: going for throat|pg||
nt|ritong: chambers wondering what s going on in @hs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn:  at the other table 1NT could have been made easily enough, but dummy had to discard on three rounds of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: some uncalled for undertricks coming|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|don_kapu: how do you when it is right or wrong ? law of The Egg of Colombus|pg||
nt|dburn:  and declarer kept all of North's diamonds and then misguessed the suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer got the @d wrong at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn:  so that she lost four spades and one of everything else|pg||
nt|blewah: continue with @c now?|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe west has led from 62|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not sure I understand the OR bidding - East did not appear to be doing enough but maye 3H was a max or min over 3C -some play this and 4H is in middle|pg||
nt|don_kapu: in Depok, this bidding style we call Dewi Persik Digging|pg||
nt|don_kapu: sdh finisse again @d, |pg||
nt|dburn:  and South probably has some shortage for the jump to 3@h|pg||

nt|blewah: what an adventure |pg||
nt|mamos: slam for EW|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in @c or @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or even @d|pg||
nt|mamos: Is this Indonesian team four -handed?|pg||
nt|blewah: even 6nt|pg||
nt|blewah: no there are 6 of them|pg||
nt|dburn:  their other pair has not played so far in this match|pg||
nt|blewah: Bojoh and Tueje have been playing in all (?) segments |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand There will be an indepth article on The Indonesian Womens Team in tomorrows Bulletin complete with Colour photo|pg||
nt|blewah: Murniati and Dewi next|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done|pg||
nt|ianmcc:  all is well for standoff|pg||
nt|ritong: if so, cheap outcome|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Robinson called director... don't know why....|pg||
nt|ritong: misexplanation, likely  call the cop for the road|pg||
nt|grebrof: the oldtimer never lead trumps at dbl contracyd either - not tat its right every time :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: discussion previous board 4@D bid|pg||
nt|ritong: neat|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: the last 3 boards, injury time, don?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: i dont think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1NT in both rooms for England?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: P - 1@D - 1@H - North (??)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: this is a very funny hand :)|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 4@h peut se jouer sur cette donne |pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: so these four have indeed played an awful lot of boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: I feel 2NT is correct but Sally wont want to miss game|pg||
nt|don_kapu: whats your westjava|pg||
nt|dburn:  if North-South can bid a lot of spades, East-West may find slam hard to reach|pg||
nt|blewah: OK. in RR 21, Bojoh - Tueje were benched|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: of course they are going to be in a failing slam |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but i suppose it will be flat board|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphznx: director left... will come back I think...|pg||
nt|ritong: as expected, 2@s was the contract other room as well on board 12|pg||
nt|grebrof: as  said about the !a lead at board 11 - leading clubs was a gamble|pg||
nt|ritong: but chambers managed better  +5|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  and North-South have just bid a lot of spades|pg||
nt|mamos: same auction as OR|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  same start in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: so far :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  but West has a pretty good hand - if 5NT meant pick a slam, she might do that|pg||
nt|ritong: and, indeed, +10 for having naively led his long suit:-)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|blewah: 3nt is an impressive score from Closed Room|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, that jack of hearts may be promoted on the bidding|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 8 tricks in @s was good going|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no West dredged up a pass- or is 1D forcing?|pg||
nt|blewah: and repeated here|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ok|pg||
nt|dburn:  not in practice, but fortunately that does not matter|pg||
mb|3H|nt|alnanda: welcome blewah...You come at the right time, seeing results, the indonesia audience can release the tension with drink BLEWAH with ice and syrup :) :)|pg||
nt|dgame: yes, |pg||
nt|yo_yo: SAlly  will win and take her winners|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 5@D 1@H 4@C = 10 tricks, am i right brother westjava|pg||
nt|ritong: brave call|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: normal choice of lead|pg||
nt|don_kapu: so many chat to me and i will repeated it|pg||
nt|grebrof: well Henri, you been in this game for what is it - 50 years ? you rather lead a tight 6 carder than a brokem 4 carder - yes?|pg||
nt|ritong: i have no clear rule|pg||
nt|ritong: lasserre hoped the surprise effect would work  it did not|pg||
nt|ritong: hence " secret weapon"|pg||
nt|jjsb2: a l'autre table ou joue 3@h |pg||
nt|ritong: piganeau pourrait ouvrir|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mug: Indonesia missed 4@S on  28 so that's 6 or 7 to England, depending on the overtricks|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  not sure what 4NT means - probably takeout, but even so...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East must have a near maximum pass to X 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: Nicola might kno w what this means   dont|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  she will not like her @h if that is the deciding factor|pg||
nt|dburn:  ...if this is the way to try for slam in hearts, Smith may be put off by the quality of her trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  she may think there is the @sA and 1 @h to lose|pg||
nt|blewah: 4nt and then 5@h must be bigger than a direct 5@h|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, partner should have five clubs for this auction, and in general when partner makes a slam try and you have the ace and king of her main suit, you should bid a slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  because she must have most of the rest|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point and East has nothing wasted in @s|pg||
nt|dburn:  for all that, East made a good decision at the other table|pg||
nt|blewah: while 4@sX could have been down 5! as Georgia said|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the surface 1 down but....|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  well done|pg||

nt|grebrof: me neither, except it is much easier for your Pif you lead from somethimg you have-  rather than guessing leading a suit your P mever bid :S|pg||

pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: not such a good idea to continue|pg||
nt|ritong: et un service gagnant|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|kit: So depending on what happens USA2 could get a pickup here|pg||
mb|d!|nt|kit: Robinson could actually pass here|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kit: Pass by him would tell Boyd to pass with 3 or more diamonds if South passes|pg||
nt|grebrof: I know I would|pg||
nt|kit: But instead he bid 2@S, pass or correct|pg||
nt|kit: This still won't make it easy for N-S|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|grebrof: the good think about bidding 2@S is that you havent warned the opps from bidding @ds|pg||
nt|kit: This is the swing I was thinking of.  I don't like Soouth's big -- and it could get them way overboard.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: North took the 4@H bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: I wouldnt even bid 2@h with that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznw: but still in doubt|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how North can fail to bid 4@H.  That will go down badly, but probably won't be doubled.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|kit: Robinson tells Boyd of the values.  Now they may get to double something.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: Although the double is basically lead-directing|pg||

nt|don_kapu: why u say that Tom|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn:  South trying for a 4-4 spade fit - I guess there might be a game, but 2@d is a good fallback position|pg||
nt|yo_yo: must be puppet stayman|pg||
nt|dburn:  2@c is Stayman|pg||

nt|alunand14: and........|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  miracle @h position gives this play|pg||
nt|ahalim: state-of-the-match bidding I think|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe Dhondy's approach in CR is the solution to this hand|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|westjava: normal lead, but a happy lead to decl|pg||
nt|mamos: well  it is not impossible|pg||
nt|blewah: unorthodox 2NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, North was probably worth only 4NT, but 6NT is understandable - there should be around 32-33 highs|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but this hand can be make by sq E in @S and @D|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: one agresive biding from Lusye ,that's her style|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play a 20-22 2NT opening; North was perhaps expecting her partner to be better than that|pg||
nt|mamos: East will have some troubleome discards|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure the 3@s bid was genious|pg||
nt|ritong: momentum broken|pg||

pc|hA|nt|dgame: could gain 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks in OR  looks a lot |pg||

nt|dburn:  indeed, but South didn't open 2NT - she opened 2@c|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|westjava: freak distribution of @C|pg||
nt|dgame: nice chance|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure why declarer put up the queen - East not all that likely to lead a spade from the king when partner had opened 1@h|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Unfortunately, this deal looks very flat.  Unless France has an accident and gets too high, they will win the gold.|pg||
nt|grebrof: 10 aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|kit: Robinson could have opened a frisky 3@C if he knew he needed a swing, but he doesn't know that.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: This limits South's hand, so no danger of an accident.  North will just bid 3NT.|pg||

nt|ritong: obvious double|pg||
nt|ritong: textbook, even|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: 11-15 6+@c|pg||
nt|nkgupt: look like USA2 up 20 going to the 5th set of the SF ...cant see a swing on this one|pg||
nt|mug: England in trouble|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d= good @h raise|pg||
nt|ritong: presumably|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|blewah: glad she didn't listen to me and open 2NT|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 145 - 144 not a leader just a winning draw|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will South sit?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and The Netherlands BB 16 ahead Italy|pg||
nt|blewah: i don't think so|pg||
nt|ritong: north unconcerned for the time being|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I couls see Robinson notes...|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: could*|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Nicola wont pass that|pg||

nt|yo_yo: she did|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c minimum with no M|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not anymore now... :)|pg||
nt|ritong: robinson takes his last chance to score big in this set|pg||
nt|ritong: lasserre is a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: so, chances of making something big are reduced for poizat|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: as we  get ready to start the board, let me say, many thanks, to our operator Ruud from Netherland.  A job well done!!|pg||
nt|don_kapu: i dont think South stand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: 155 -145 to England is the score|pg||
nt|dgame: a swing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: maybe 1 imp for Indonesia if play 8@D|pg||
nt|blewah: wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: ty v much to our fellow commentator from Indonesia and England...|pg||
nt|dgame: will set 1|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can make playing for the @cA onside|pg||
nt|don_kapu: yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders cannot stop the ruff without losing their second trump trick|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 1@S discard from @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: for info, EW play Precision Modified (they call Djarum Precision) system |pg||
nt|mug: this can go down but South needs to play her heart|pg||
nt|blewah: tough girl, Dewi|pg||
nt|ianmcc: again, we'll see|pg||
nt|jjsb2: la derniere ne creera probablement pas de gros swing et celle d'avant ne sera pas trop negatif cela semble bien parti .. |pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphznx: last board of this round thx all|pg||
nt|westjava: sry, I am told that EW play standard|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: yes ... England started with a 10-IMP carry-over so they have in fact lost 32 IMPs for now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  slight clue for the @cA onside is that South might have led a @c with similar holdings in each minor|pg||
nt|alnanda: how about 1 !|pg||
nt|alnanda: how about 1 @c losser ?|pg||
nt|dgame: interesting|pg||
nt|anton72: i am apologise ...but ..whats happened now ...c/o is missing here in result ?...somebody to know?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: this is depend of line of play E to place N with @S Q or S with @C ace|pg||
nt|mamos: Thanks to everyone who has joined us and especially to our fine op  who has kept us in touch with all the excitement thanks to WBF  and BBO  for letting us join in|pg||
nt|mamos: and lets all rejoin for the excitement of the last stanza|pg||
nt|blewah: decl doesn't seem to have much option than hoping @cA onside|pg||
nt|mug: @SK was not a good start|pg||
nt|ritong: apparently rashness will not get rewarded|pg||
nt|ritong: quelle partie|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 4@s gagne egalement |pg||
pc|h2|nt|alnanda: struggle has not ended, semifinals waiting, we continue to give support to those with good sportsmanship|pg||

nt|dgame: shopping time|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphznx: action :)|pg||
nt|mamos: it seems declare is relying on favourable Spade position|pg||
nt|don_kapu: a small @C return will make a smoke on the fire|pg||
nt|alnanda: @h again !! :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|brolucius: Netherlands declarer just went one down in 3NT after a diamond lead from East. |pg||

pc|hA|pg||

nt|brolucius: In Bermuda Bowl, v Italy.|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, long and winding road....|pg||
nt|don_kapu: u said goodbye and i said hello|pg||
nt|mug: @SJ diamond ruff, @CA and another heart for the trump promotion was beating it|pg||
nt|mug: can the defence still survive?|pg||
nt|jjsb2: je crois qu'on va avoir droit a notre "200+50" Henri mais cette fois par pour nous . :) (sur la precedente)|pg||
nt|ritong: on a du gaz|pg||
nt|8252: cette 32 devrait être plate. Et la 31 va voir un rapproché de USA, mais insuffisant|pg||
nt|ritong: mais pas trop|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: nous allons perdre 6 sur la 31   mais restera   de quoi gagner   |pg||
