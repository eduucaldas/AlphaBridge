nt|santyclz2:  Some people treat 7/5 as a 1-suiter, some as a 2.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gluckenval: Fantunes's system is a conv. one... they didn't change their agreements since 2001 more or less :) any opening bids at level 1 is usually 14+ (with ecceptions), 1NT weak 12-14 with ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 5M too, and the openings bid at level 2 are in the range 10-13|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with DBL promising points/values @s game wouldn't be an overbid|pg||

pc|d6|nt|paulg:  excited that I'm doing USA 1 vs USA 2 :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow you are?|pg||
nt|paulg:  with Roland and Bill|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Both methods have  plusses and minuses.|pg||
nt|paulg:  which, with all due respect, is not as intimidating as doing it with Larry Cohen|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|nt|hantveit: probably 1nt-p-2kl-p-2h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Zmud99: of course Piekarek didn't open 3@D|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|stoffers: good lead, down now as declearer played 'safe' |pg||
nt|santyclz: That seemed more likely until the continuations.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bjr à tous|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|psyck: we seem to be missing the auction other room, but it cannot have been as good as here anyway|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|penseur9: bonjour|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|penseur9: playing low spades to try and prevent declarer to go to dummy|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup: shortage of entryes made this +1 and it looks very normal|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hantveit: anyones guess|pg||
nt|santyclz: It looks as if we're in for some imaginative bidding this round.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ace to prevent the overtrick.|pg||
nt|hantveit: well, the good thing is that this gives us action already from the start. they stopped in a normal 1N in closed|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: it is about a 30.5% slam|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe 2H was a kind of TO ? but I have to emit, i have never heard about such a thing before|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: claims ruffing a @c and a @s|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|Zmud99: Hi Rashed|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Herve.|pg||
nt|gioffi: really?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gioffi: k@H?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|hantveit: not a nice start for NS. and yesterday they lost the victory on the last hand...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hantveit: ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: That doesn't look right...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Though it didn't matter.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: commentating with LC is cool! he does it all|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|paulg:  I saw Versace say that playing in 2NT is considered a sin in Italy |pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  he is doing the final match on Sunday, Italy vs Bulgaria|pg||
nt|hedyg: well EW are French...|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I am at the other table|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hT|pc|cT|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  EW had good sacrifice here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: different countries, different sins|pg||
nt|penseur9: great defense|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hantveit: 6h is on withouth club lead|pg||
nt|hantveit: 20-10 points, so should stop|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H N/S seems the max here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stoffers: Nunes had to have exactly doubleton for playing the ace to be wrong, + 0-3@h ofcource. Unlucky by Gromov!|pg||
nt|gluckenval: about the lead of the italians, they have a 3 pages of supplementary sheets for their slavinsky leads... i.e. with 83 the lead is rev. (small from 2 cards)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but not in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  awkward hand for North .. 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and David Edwin|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi there|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 7N, 7@c and 7@h N/S. Will they find it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no double :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13, 5+ cards, unbalanced|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi David|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  my request to be flown out to the warmer climes of Monaco has been refused, but still a pleasure to see some world-class players|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: double|pg||
nt|ady: hi Andre|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: @d for no loser was about 62% & of course need @s fin...|pg||
nt|psyck: for 1 loser i meant|pg||
nt|stoffers: declearer will have some pressure on 5 rounds of spades, and need to find the Q@c to make this|pg||
nt|hantveit: but if we look on lousers, there is 12 tricks. (24-8-4=12 tricks)|pg||
nt|hantveit: losers|pg||
nt|santyclz: 12 tricks in @hs, unfortunately e-w have 2 first.|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Herve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Probably not.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: What a start to this 12 board match!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Bærentsen taking his time :) I understand his problem|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: ah ok|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bill|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Zmud99: There's 2 session in this Patton - Session A (afternoon) and Session B ( tonight ) - Each session play 4 matches of 8 boards - Session A and B best teams will qualify for tomorrow |pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Roland welcome|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2@h is constructive here, so EW probably play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 20:20 HCP both sides and likely NT.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Hello|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts and another, Bill?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  W has to find @d switch now|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, if they take it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not any more.|pg||
nt|penseur9: lookis like 4 loosers here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not sure |pg||
nt|ady: on top|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: the last CC we have for NS is : http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c is a little precipitous|pg||
nt|hedyg: they have made some changes since..|pg||
nt|hedyg: no CC for EW|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back Hedy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed for the contract.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are from Genova, Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Paul :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3NT would probably have been the choice of most, second choice 3@s|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Rankings before last match : 1) White House 137  2) Bonori  136  3) Zimmermann 133  4) De Botton 129  5) Patane 126  6) Italia School 124  7) GIB 121  8) Ward Platt 120  9) Corsica ...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 120  10) Brondi  116    Top 6 teams qualify for Quarter Final tomorrow ( plus 2 teams from Patton B )|pg||
pc|d7|nt|runnerup: some chancce for -2 now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the match is very close, so each and every imp counts|pg||
nt|hantveit: a wash, and next|pg||
nt|kjadams: close game here.   Spade lead should scuttle it.|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi CK and John-wlc|pg||
nt|kjadams: Thanks ara|pg||
nt|kjadams: 1 imp for Bonori on 1st when declarer opted for a heart finesse rather than a double squeeze.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Both lines look close to even money|pg||
nt|paulg:  Nunes also senses problems for them|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I guess H and another, or H + minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  i wonder if double was not penalty, as South looks too strong for 3@s opposite a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hervé!|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Hervé|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 3 world champions at table|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|psyck: work on minors or ruff @h?...|pg||
nt|kjadams: this hand, I can't see any line to avoid a loser in each suit, so down 1 will be best case, and down 2 seems possible.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not the best lead on this hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gluckenval: cut & paste from their leads... i.e.: K6532 = 2; K653 = 6; 9832 = 2; 983 = 9; 92 = 2;|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but I don't count|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2 in NS....and 1 is operating :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: Fantoni can tell from the bidding that they have a fit problem|pg||
nt|penseur9: if you don't Roland... where do I stand :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Standings after Round 8/9 : 1) Gladysh 140  2) Zimmermann 138  3) White House 138  4) Ventin 122  5) Marill 120  6)  Vainikonis E  117  7) De Botton 114  8) Welland  112  9)  ...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Vainikonis  110  10 ) Zaleski  88    First 2 will play a final of 3X16 tomorrow |pg||
nt|runnerup: west has already shown 1 ace -so time to give ruff -wd|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fantoni can also see the @sAK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator is?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: most lines work here...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Nathalie Frey is operating :)  Venice cup winner in Estoril :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: fantastic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sex change operation? it reads Frederic in his/her profile|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 hearts and 4+ in a minor|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Zmud99: yes but it's false|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: well, that is by the way|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7@D would seem to be on here.  I don't know if it's biddable but 6 seems like a good shot.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|hantveit: next hand is interesting...|pg||
nt|santyclz: We're trying to get the names for the e-w pair.|pg||
nt|hantveit: they are from france are they?|pg||
nt|hantveit: France|pg||
nt|Zmud99: yes they are|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Herve.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=894  Nathalie Frey|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome.|pg||
nt|kjadams: ah, moving to cr|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: W could have been very short in @s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: I don't know if there's a way to find the duplication in the auction|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can't really think of one myself|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|santyclz2:  N-s had a plus score available defending 1nt.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|runnerup: that is true but who can blame north for balancing -no one so looks normal|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: once he saw @st, no more probs for dec|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Point of no return|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz2:  Yes - was a comment, not a criticism.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  of course, Fantoni-Nunes are like sharks when they smell blood|pg||
pc|hA|nt|penseur9: right|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  GIB would have made the contract on this defence, but Duboin's line was equally as good but should have been less successful|pg||
pc|d4|nt|penseur9: no communication N to S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

nt|paulg:  tough start for East-West|pg||
nt|hedyg: 800 rarely good|pg||
nt|hedyg: ruff out the Q@D and drop the 10|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think East needed to take more time there|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|kjadams: 12 well deserved iMPS for making 4S on board 1|pg||
nt|kjadams: Other room tried 3N which had no chance.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Right contract was played:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Very difficult bid for N, but I think 4@h was too little.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: how many @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: in these short matches of only 8 bds when you lose 800 the match is practically over|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok folks, cool pls, the Bermuda Bowl doesnt start till Sunday!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13, 5+ cards, unbalanced|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14+   5+ cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 4@H EW , safety 5@C by NS|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  how many @s rather :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: i mean west bid -5 @d is even possible -some do |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  your bets? 4@d vs 4@s? higher stakes?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I'm a 4 bidder both ways...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even 5@d with indicated @s lead look quite fine|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, they play real bridge, not double dummy|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hantveit: a cold seven as we can see, they stopped in closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: 2 @c and 2 @s -3|pg||
nt|ady: who ever plays goes down|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ybob: sry @C ruff|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @h -is 2 down -@d ruffs -3nt ns |pg||
nt|stoffers: 3 or 4@s Nunes?|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2H is a bit weak for my taste|pg||
nt|santyclz: 16 top tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: @D ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 losers only, strong suit, and a H in partners suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: kalispera Manos :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H relay, at least invitational|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam possible here I'd think|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|santyclz2:  Remember that the 1@s bid by Nunes shows a good hand.  Lessor hands are opened 2@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: hard to plat 3NT when opps bid 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 10-13, unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: play|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 4 @d is a winner -but you cant bid it anymore|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 10-13 (good 9) 5+.|pg||
nt|stoffers: bad splits here, but will bring home 10 tricks easy|pg||
nt|gluckenval: obviously, in 3rd seat and not Vul they are undisciplined :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: should North take control of the bidding here?|pg||
nt|kjadams: Spades will make 3 or 4 here.   Club suit frozen, but tough to arrange a pitch.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|hantveit: still, they should be able to find it now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is like the previous hand ... North has all the wrong cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And this will go down a large number of 50's ... should East have hit it?|pg||
nt|penseur9: the dealer must be as tired as the players at this hour :)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H might have made|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  Some pairs rebid 1NT with the West hand, but never in France |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: EW lead 3rd and 5th|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|runnerup: the moment of truth|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Drum-roll, please...|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks to go -1 ok|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lead something and claim, please! 13 more boards to come|pg||
nt|hantveit: 5S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ybob: only @D lead defeat it|pg||
nt|runnerup: North saved -and no @d lead -so winner|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6C|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think West has to balance at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ybob: for that was better bid 4@D over 3NT|pg||
nt|hantveit: 7H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many people who play 2/1 reserve a 3@h rebid on this auction for a solid suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: if partner holds xxx in dia, it is still a 52% chance to make. dia 2-2 or dia q drop|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Tez :) welcome|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: I don't think he can double 3@D, partner did not have to be this strong|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hantveit: might bid 6d on the way|pg||
nt|hantveit: wereas Multon will be given the honor to bid 7H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|paulg:  not without risk of course|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: With the @H10 and @cace onside and the j dropping this should make an overtrick.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hantveit: north might be afraid a pas on 6D...|pg||
nt|santyclz: @h q|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's problem here is that west can get in with the @CA and draw a third round of trumps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stoffers: Well judged by Gromov to double the third time (pass forcing), if he had passed i am sure dubinin had bid once more. That said 5@d or 5@h is very unlucky not to make|pg||
nt|gluckenval: def. borderline... I really don't like so much when I'm going 3 off... I think a good sacrifice bid should be for 1-2 off, no more|pg||
nt|stoffers: well, this is 2 off|pg||
nt|stoffers: Needed club-club lead and ricing with A@s to get it three down, tough to do that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I agree ... too tight at imps|pg||
nt|kjadams: The term "frozen" means neither side can lead the suit without sacrificing a trick.|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi william|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Can 3@h go down?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|stoffers: -3 now i guess|pg||
nt|stoffers: Short of trumps, good defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think East was in a more difficult position, tough to overcall 2NT with the source of tricks destroyed|pg||
nt|hedyg: as they say cinquanta il pezzo|pg||
nt|ady: caash out job|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: Well done.|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this auction 3NT clearly stands no chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good result for NS in the CR.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think I've ever said that|pg||
nt|hedyg: never played against Italians?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they know my limitations|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|mathat: thinking to retern @d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And as it's turned out, probably very difficult for the defence to find the way to beat this three tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Basically West at some point had to cash the 3 major suit tops, and get out with @CJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: but the @DJ comes down with only one diamond ruff so all should be ok|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|gluckenval: now @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  but on a less descriptive auction you'd prefer to be in 3NT than 5@d|pg||
