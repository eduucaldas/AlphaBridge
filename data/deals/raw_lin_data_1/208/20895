mb|p|nt|djneill:  the major suits are indeed quality|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  I hesitate to bid 2@s though since South chose not to bid 1@s (or anything for that matter) over X|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: this trump suit is quite interesting|pg||
nt|queequeg: the open room started right now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: clubs are well placed for East|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: if you know east has the ace, the percentage play is small to king, then duck on|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok North doubles the third time and thankfully South likes this|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: duck one|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: that gains against @HAx and @HAxx with east, and loses only to @HAJx|pg||
mb|4D|nt|djneill:  here, count is most important (how many spades will cash), so South will play a low @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|barbyh: but not enough entries for the second club finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course it would have been harder after a club lead then three rounds of spades, with west threatening to overruff dummy :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barbyh: perhaps west might have bid 2nt to slow the auction down|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: i guess east was going for singleton spade with partner but that was a bit of a long shot i think|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|danilo1: if 11s dble promissed @S .. someting is wrong with EW system ... why should notEast be able to Dble for penalty - and if so agreed, why than West does not Dble instead of 3@D ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: (already promissed 6-cards) bidding 2@D free|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|djneill:  ok so West should probably cash the @dA here because North has at most 1 diamond, it might be the King, but West may think South has all the diamonds, in which case, not cashing the dA is better so as to have the end position better|pg||
nt|djneill:  but for sure, West cannot pick up all the diamonds, North will not have a doubleton on this auction|pg||

nt|djneill:  good double by North I think|pg||
nt|djneill:  South must Pass this, to bid would be weak when N-S could have game|pg||
nt|danilo1: sure good Dble (hope NAT in system) .. I play last poss Dble 11+ NAT|pg||
mb|4C|nt|djneill:  this will be entertaining now|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  redouble probably shows some 2-suited hand?  2@c to play if one of those is @c?|pg||
nt|djneill:  South's Pass was strong so North will double this surely|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 sp must be sp and clubs|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no aces, no game Mr Savelli..|pg||

nt|bridge_one: no - 3@D give directly the doubleton in @D|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: the major can be @H or @S (so 3@H ask) (i don't agree, better West bid 3N with support in both and bid the major without support of 3 cards - declarer must be opener)|pg||
