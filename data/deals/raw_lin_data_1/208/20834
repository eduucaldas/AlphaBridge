mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjy:  no multi Al?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: they don't play weak 2's in any way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   Ultimate Canape system uses unusual 2@C/@D/@H openings  |pg||
nt|vugraphzns: and their coach told them not to preempt TOO much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  2@S=natural weak 2    a fluke in the system|pg||

pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|benjy:  Many would pass over 1@D with the north cards facing a passed partner, but i agree with the X|pg||
nt|kareno: I do as well.|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: i think dbl by van Prooijen over 5@c would have shown interest in bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|kareno: Down only one.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those "Cokin" doubles definitely apply after they open and get to game   not sure after pass//takeout double|pg||
nt|benjy:  Looks like this is making to me|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm referring to 5@h.  5@c is obviously making.|pg||
nt|benjy:  A spec suggests that with such a strong holding in diamonds that north should lead a trump|pg||
nt|benjy:  i agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen leads of @H not working out these last 2 hands|pg||
nt|benjy:  It would still make though|pg||
nt|kareno: Trump lead would be useful but with diamonds as they are, it won't defeat 5@c|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|kareno: Kit :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if it hasn't been mentioned   it is a little strange that vanProoijen didn't take out insurance against vul vs not opponents|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|kit: I see.  This one is just a dull push :)|pg||

nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 - 15. North has 10, with a 3343|pg||
nt|roswolf: it does show that everyone is watching carefully:)|pg||
nt|harmon: only chance to beat this is with swindle win 1st dwith ace|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|rhelle: so a max of 25, and the risk of going off in 2NT for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx that should settle the cannibals down|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@D = short @S?    none, low, high|pg||
nt|kit: Quite possibly 3@S asked for shortness, and 4@D in a coded manner showed spade shortness.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or will W conttinue?|pg||
nt|kit: How can West continue?  His 3@H call itself was a stretch.|pg||
nt|benjy:  If west is continuing then what was the point in showing shortness?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so who is taking a pause here then:)?|pg||

pc|c5|nt|rhelle: now declarer has some problems, and needs to start looking for his 9th trick|pg||

nt|ady: K@D best chance  |pg||
nt|ady: I think needs an error in defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: East has to duck, otherwise you have another entry to dummy|pg||

nt|ady: does not have to duck   just clear hearts|pg||

nt|sybarra: but so much easier from this vantage point, dont you think?|pg||
nt|ady: wests play of 10@H  seems odd    maybe a view graph error|pg||
nt|rhelle: Declarer has noted the @h discard on the 1st @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no error, W started @H 10...|pg||
nt|ady: well seems to be an error in defence  10@H lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: Where are the points? the 3rd hand 1@h doesn't promise the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Muller thinking of every possible distribution,  knowing the @C and (maybe) hts|pg||

nt|frankaus: all the kibs and gib make it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller is trying to work out why East played @H9 at Trick 1. With QJ98x, East would overtake @H10, in case it was a singleton.|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer seems to have 9 tricks; 3@c, 2@d, 2@h, 2@s|pg||

nt|kit: North could see the vulnerabity, but he knows his partner can see it also.  He has a minimum, so properly passes.|pg||
nt|kit: And just as well, since 3NT has no play on the heart lead.|pg||
nt|benjy:  if declarer wins this in hand and lead a low @D then east needs to win the king and play another @H to hold declarer to 8 tricks|pg||

nt|kit: Declarer worried about 5-3 heart split, but he has to go after diamonds and spades and hope defenders can't set up 6 tricks.|pg||
nt|benjy:  West might have held singleton ace of diamonds i suppose so it wasn't clear to go in|pg||

nt|kit: and even if he does lead back a club, so what?|pg||

nt|kit: Now declarer won't even be able to afford to take the heart finesse, since he risks losing control if he ruffs a club back to his hand.|pg||

nt|ady: need to be a good guesser|pg||
nt|warrens:  do N/S play 4th best or attitude leads vs nt?|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|rhelle: they play better seeing 13 cards that I do with all 52 :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: lots of clubs played and discards not fun for n/s |pg||
nt|petergill: attitude leads to NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting; there is a double @d finesse as well that can be taken|pg||
nt|petergill: so W does not know if @s are 4-4 or 5-3 - good point, Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  with attitude leads this is much harder|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: indeed - they certainly turn over the imps|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: they started teasing SJoert|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: Yes indeed|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, EW play attitude against NT, so declarer has no clue about North's @s length|pg||
nt|warrens:  now declarer hopes to learn something from the discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N can pitch 2 @h's and then one more card (=?) if clubs are run|pg||
nt|warrens:  one reasonable line is a @d to the 9, then try a @D to the Q the next time|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play diamond finesse   for contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: NS System Card (attitude leads to NT is "low = like") http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 2 @h to QJ is 75%|pg||
nt|rhelle: @d to Q is 50%|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: yes   that does cater for J10 diamonds onside   but in this case might go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: North not vul has passed over 1@C ---> 5 card suit a bit less likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: but that is only if you know @s are 4-4 ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more doesn't matter much non vul|pg||
nt|rhelle: remember kibitzers, NS play attitude leads. So the @s2 indicates an honour, not length|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: I think W has deliberately timed his club cashing sequence so N has to discard twice before South discards --> N's problem a little bit tougher|pg||
pc|h3|nt|warrens:  @D to the 9, then to the Q is 62.5%, so a @H to the QJ means you're more than 80% sure N has only 4 @S's|pg||
nt|petergill: W from the attitude lead knows N has @SQxxx or @SQxxxx so he wants North to discard before S, as S has easy @s discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N has (cunningly?) kept his @H discard until last, to try to look more like a man with 5332 shape|pg||
nt|rhelle: the big strength of NS is their incredibly tight defence|pg||
nt|petergill: (I think) N knew he had to make 2 more discards, so he released the @D (less comfortable discard) before the @H, to make the position less clear to West. |pg||
nt|petergill: If S releases another @S, W can play @H safely unless N has @HAK |pg||
nt|ady: whats the betting here?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm going for -1 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: red card discard, else this makes easily|pg||
nt|rhelle: but I'm heavily biased|pg||
nt|petergill: I was wrong - spade discard ---> @S can rise @HA on @H of dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: NS first discard   odd = encourage|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, but taking those discards at face value is a direct route to the poorhouse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S point was right, because then @S have broken 4-4, so S cannot throw a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: NS UDCA with 1st discard odd encourage|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H lead in OR    so no problem|pg||
nt|warrens:  we can see by this auction that W's distribution is concealed, making it harder for the defense (and putting us to sleep as we wait)|pg||
nt|petergill: so N's @D6 and @S's @S3 discard were really telling declarer as little as possible|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands might go in front |pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller is of course known for his phenomenal thinks|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: 1@S was asking. 1@D was or 0-7 or something with both majors or a 3rd option i dont anymore|pg||
nt|rhelle: with 3@d, North shows values. South opts to defend, so North is happy with that|pg||
nt|ady: so the USA in game in both rooms  and more imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, this looks like -1 and 6 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|petergill: For the Transnational, the format in yesterday's Daily Bulletin (number 11) overrules any format on the website|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ady: unfortunately 4@H should fail last hand e/w   and 3NT|pg||

nt|sybarra: this might be a bit difficult to handle |pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|bbramley: he'd like about 5 entries to his own hand, but he's a little short of that|pg||

nt|kit: Makes sense over 1 of minor opening, but don't see it over 1 major opening since double shows 4 of other major anyway|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|bbramley: very light opening - in the modern style, or a very old-fashioned style, if you will - his hand qualifies easily by losing trick count, if not by honor count|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bbramley: this is a poor setup for the N/S methods - north has been preempted into showing his second suit at a high level|pg||

nt|ady: Brink has a pretty useless hand for spades  especially on ace king and another spade opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: South surely has a dead maximum for his 14-16 1NT opening.  Facing the inv+ xfr, he has a clear 4@H bid.|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|vugraphznt: Grue: good luck, this time I mean it...|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Brink has no idea if he is on time.. he asked they have 55 min for those last boards|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bbramley: of course, it's usually a poor setup to have a light opener into a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but sometimes pards clubs are more like his spade suit |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: or spade suit is more like the club suit I should say |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - opening on distro is always optimistic, hoping for a fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you probably roll for 6 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he has 3 trumps to lose and the @H ace off the top, and there may be a handling charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps maybe the difficulty |pg||
nt|bbramley: although if he runs some diamonds, west may be tempted to compromise his trump holding (but i doubt he will)|pg||

nt|wstuart: The dutch would be ahead by 2 now if not for the 18 IMP swing on board 2 where teh Americans bid approx a 2% slam which came in.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rhelle: even so, nasty problem for West. It could be anything, from 4@s to 7@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is tightening nicely -(for us neutrals)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijver taking a postion  for a long thought|pg||
nt|roswolf: that weak2 by south is a hippy bid if ever i saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijer sighs a few times|pg||
nt|ady: will get to 6@S   iam sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: in a sense unlucky his pard is so weak|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like the 2@H preempt there.  He has good intermediates and virtually no def outside.|pg||
nt|ady: I  very much doubt pass|pg||
mb|5H|an|slam try with !H cuebid|mb|p|nt|rhelle: Nor th wil certainly lead the @cA|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 imps to Netherlands, surely|pg||
nt|ady: that  very ambitius  with void heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: look in movie,  it was club lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps 5@S would be voidwood (void spade, loking for 7@H), so West's choices were 4@S and 6@S - a guess. |pg||
nt|ady: as long as they dont bid 7|pg||
mb|5N|nt|warrens:  needs to lead @C Ace or a @S|pg||
nt|rhelle: However, North's second card will be problematic. If it's a @d, it's made|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone says @D,  my movie shows club |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S after long tht or no long tht  west would surely pass|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sybarra: will S try 3 @H?|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I would win the trump and put N to the test by playing @CK at Trick 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  now, N has to rise on a small @C lead from W, which I think is easy to do looking at dummy's @H's|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry bd 30 a diamond |pg||
nt|ady: mine shows a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the E hand looks like the ones I have been holding recently |pg||
nt|bbramley: none vul is best for competing - i'm surprised he didn't, altho he already bid twice and his partner was there|pg||
nt|sybarra: enough!! |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes - when i was a hippy at university abd did something silly like this against Boris Schapiro - he called it a hippy bid and said i would learn someday - never forgot that|pg||
nt|wstuart: Well everyone, I have to go play live bridge myself now.  Have fun and we'll see you tomorrow (or late tonight for those of us on the west coast of the US.)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rhelle: This is though|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: tricky   must play ace|pg||
nt|rhelle: very well played!|pg||
nt|ady: abd must resist diamond|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ady: north was awake|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK at Trick 2 could be a singleton king so might be taken, whereas the low club is more certain to draw the unwelcome ace (if @DK was onside)|pg||
nt|rhelle: South played the @c9, an even number|pg||
nt|warrens:  no way he'll play a @D.  W can't have been missing both minor aces|pg||
nt|rhelle: So my money is on another @c, to try and cut communications|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|bbramley: looks like down a couple, but still a good save vs. the 140 that south could make in hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the OR made 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: W always on lead, to probably gives a trick somewhere |pg||
nt|bbramley: they may have gotten desperate trying to beat 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: to=so |pg||
nt|rhelle: both a @c and a @c are good - even a @h works as West can't get rid of 3 @ds|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: this has just propelled e/w to slam - i trust south has flowers in his hair:)|pg||
nt|ady: declaration very soon|pg||
mc|12|pg||
qx|o15|st||md|1SHDC,SHDC,SHDC,SHDC|sv|n|nt|benjy:  Netherlands take the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|kit: We have seen that their jump raise can be pretty light, but even so ....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the tension is mounting and promises a fine 2nd day tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Netherlands in the lead!|pg||
mb|1N!|an|5+!d, 4M|nt|ahollan1: they started with 1 imp carryover  so  effectively  tied match|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: b16 will be the last of today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Raptor strikes |pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: 4 either major  and 5+@D|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: and in other room  Raptor by the other Dutch pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've never seen that before|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: this can easily go wrong for NS|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C a good hand   not sure if it said anything more than that|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did not expect W to bid 5@C sorry|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|benjy:  I assume south would have driven to game knowing pd held @D plus a major|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good hand looking for major   versus  3@H which would be pass/correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm just guessing|pg||
nt|kit: West decided that opponents likely had a game and 5@C would be a decent save.  Understandable -- but on this hand I'm not so sure 4@S would have handled.|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course West was expecting 4@h rather than 4@s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: 2 reasons I am not shouting when Dutch do win a board: 1. We must be impartial and 2. I am personally also a big fan of  USA2 after commentating almost all thier matches last 12 ...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: days|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: I do like the 5@C call -- much more likely to be a decent save and maybe cause opponents to misjudge than to be a phantom|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c9|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|dT|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: from the auction  it was clear that nobody knew who could make what|pg||
pg||
qx|c15|st||md|1SHDC,SHDC,SHDC,SHDC|sv|n|nt|petergill: so S's @C9 meant that N knew that W had @CKxx|pg||
nt|sybarra: as he should be!|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, that is predictable|pg||
nt|petergill: It was S who erred, not N|pg||
nt|roswolf: team orange wearing the sober suits|pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+!D|mb|1N!|an|5+!C 4M|nt|bbramley: well done - he made it - now that's a good save - so 7 imps and new leader|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure they would have bid a slam  slowly or quickly|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5+!D |mb|3C|nt|rhelle: Yes, of course, sorry ... the 9 is an ODD number|pg||
nt|roswolf: you never know david - momentum of the auction is relevant|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: whereas South had an EVEN number of Clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's imagination is working overtime if he thought about bidding here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@C is something more than 5+@D but couldn't read what was written|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this should make |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: perhaps spades as well|pg||
mb|4C|nt|warrens:  So, South meant the 9 to show a @H card and N took it as an odd number|pg||
nt|drewsky: It all depends on their defensive agreements...if the 9 of @C was count, then south erred. However, many experts us tend to play suit prefernce|pg||
nt|rhelle: fortunately, NS will sit out the next session|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think N played W for AKQJxxxxx void x Kxx, but that seems unlikely on the bidding - but he has to trust his partner's count card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|ady: 3@D  making    4@C  down 1    -50   ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 9 the expected 10 imps when the dutch made 3nt|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|bbramley: @C9 is a handy card here|pg||
nt|ady: diamond could never be right   unless his partner had the ace    which seems impossible|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|bbramley: he'll get at least 4 spades and 1 of each, probably an extra club when west tries to cash them|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree, Peter, it had to be something like that, but that means playing W for a pretty crazy bid non-vul|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|sybarra: maybe an imp for n/s  |pg||
nt|bbramley: he might be able to read the club position if @C5 is a count card|pg||

nt|roswolf: north ducked the club ace|pg||
nt|bobholl: flat ?|pg||
nt|josj: ducked @CA|pg||
nt|benjy:  This looks like a tremendous result in the other room|pg||
nt|kit: Even ace of clubs ducked doesn't do it|pg||
nt|athene: interesting hand - north ducked a club led towards the east hand|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: all for joining us here and specialy the commentators!|pg||
nt|drewsky: Peter.....may I ask you..what card would have played as south if you held the ace of @D ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the set    interesting set|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: Grue telling 4@D was making after this auction, guessing the @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2N!|nt|ady: bad lay for 4@H  e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will bid game I would think|pg||
mb|3D!|an|any limit they agree now|nt|roswolf: this looks like 4@H i agree david|pg||
nt|ady: J@H    best lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Harold   and thx all and kibs|pg||
nt|roswolf: although west does only have a 9 count|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  3rd vul & always 4th|pg||
nt|warrens:  a nice squeeze on the previous hand for an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: kib suggested 3NT       but that also should fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a little too much testosterone i think|pg||
nt|ady: might get a diamond loser on 3rd spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Unsure about meanings|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rhelle: now @d7 is count - odd number|pg||
nt|warrens:  needed to start with a @C, but most players avoid leading from Axxx against NT|pg||
nt|ady: if north comes in with A@C   will likely switch to a spade   and south will probably cash out for down 1|pg||
nt|ady: thx Gerbrand    thx all|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set of the day begins in about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  since S has all the entries, this should make easily|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin Lall tried lead of @SA|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 30: The golden rule of expert bridge is to trust partner, not the opponents. Thus, when N is faced with a choice between two impossibilities, he must trust partner, not the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: opponent who appears to have pulled out the wrong bidding card (went for 4@S and accidentally bid 6@S off two aces) |pg||
pc|h8|pc|d3|nt|rhelle: As south, you can 'see' that North must have a virtual yarborough|pg||

nt|ady: Netherlands have made a nice recovery   |pg||
