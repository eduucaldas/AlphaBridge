mb|1H|nt|danilo1: risky pass by Doris ... but believe - agreement to reopen if @D shorth|pg||
nt|chmitty: what a hand in South after a 1@d opening !|pg||
nt|chmitty: Should she bid 3@d for instance now ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: dificult bidding for South now ... maybe 3@D best showing her hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chmitty: she passed first hand|pg||
nt|danilo1: y ... as expected, 3@D|pg||
nt|chmitty: so Bocchi should not try 3NT probably|pg||
nt|chmitty: but he has a 15 count|pg||
nt|danilo1: since she is passed pd, difficult to expect 2 entries (needed) .. believe Bocchi will work it out and pass|pg||
nt|danilo1: + she must have long @D that are not solid (KQJ) and something aside (did not preempt)|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  2@d is a common treatment in europe so probably E-W have discussed this delayed 3@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  East is anxious to get that heart lead into the AQ|pg||
nt|chmitty: Classicaly, the x shows 3 @h support OR a strong hand with maybe two cards only|pg||
nt|chmitty: East was asked the question : do you have a @s stopper, and he politely answered|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm i think that might be a bit tricky to handle|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: thk West could bid 3@S immediately ... but prefered to use - evidently kind of Lebensohl |pg||
nt|chmitty: Catani in 9th place : they badly need a victory against this strong team|pg||

mb|p|nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: Ciao :)|pg||
nt|athene: west can double 2@H for takeout|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|djneill:  East doubles to show 4+@s (1@s would deny @s)|pg||
nt|djneill:  of course|pg||
nt|danilo1: most of my (serious) bridge careet, I played in Italy :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: x shows @s|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok North chose to reopen with 2@s rather than double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning from the beautiful Poconos.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  the major suits are indeed quality|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: 2@S by North is kind of ... Mixed events bridge|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: apparently he can't :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: declarer will probably lose 1@H, 1@S and 1@D .. but no @C :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: on a @s lead, the @d goes away|pg||
pc|c3|nt|djneill:  I hesitate to bid 2@s though since South chose not to bid 1@s (or anything for that matter) over X|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. all depends on lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: this trump suit is quite interesting|pg||
nt|queequeg: the open room started right now :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|barbyh: clubs are well placed for East|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: if you know east has the ace, the percentage play is small to king, then duck on|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok North doubles the third time and thankfully South likes this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: CATTANI - BRIDGE BOLOGNA RASTIGNANO  after 3 round is in 9° position with 36 points - Lavazza first with 61 points|pg||
nt|chmitty: On this kind of bidding, lead the most neutral suit is the best - long term - but Saurer tried something else here|pg||
nt|danilo1: believe in @S AQ now (discarding @D)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: duck one|pg||
nt|chmitty: we can see that 3@h is a make so you must defeat 2@s|pg||
nt|chmitty: best lead for defence|pg||
nt|chmitty: South worried by possible @c ruffs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|athene: that gains against @HAx and @HAxx with east, and loses only to @HAJx|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|djneill:  here, count is most important (how many spades will cash), so South will play a low @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: they can open their @c trick, added to 1@h, 1@d and 3@s|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|chmitty: 5 only losers but I believe declarer will run short of trumps too soon|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|barbyh: but not enough entries for the second club finesse|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: of course it would have been harder after a club lead then three rounds of spades, with west threatening to overruff dummy :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I do not disagree with Berndt ... he cannot lead @D, @S would finess pd and trump gives away tempo ... but I would lead @CQ |pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|djneill:  South has a great hand opposite an overcall, should North raise 2@h to 3@h?|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: 3NT from CR was not great contract |pg||

nt|ryskiel_: again misunderstanding in bidding - Neve bid 2@d as transfer but Bochci dont understand it|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok that would explain it|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|djneill:  if just bleeds 3 trumps then just 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|djneill:  extra trick can be maybe set up @s, or ruff @d or just ruff everything|pg||

nt|bebechira: 2c obv forcing|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm, i guess 2nt shows a maximum with no major|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bridge_one: another good decision by Lavazza - could dbl giving the minors, but vulnerable isn't a good choice|pg||
nt|athene: not exactly what east wanted to hear|pg||
nt|chmitty: East hoped to play in a 44 major fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: for communication reasons you may win with @h ace and play a small @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm surprised that, if the partnership allows to make a Stayman with this hand, you can rebid to 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: In 2/1 this hand might have been more fun.  2@c by n, 2@s by s, p p ? (double or let them play?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: looks like missunderstanding ... guess Joanna will now simply bid 3NT|pg||
nt|chmitty: a success for the strong @c here if West leads his top @c unknown in the bidding|pg||
pc|cK|nt|djneill:  not sure what the 2@d is, maybe it is a 3 card heart raise|pg||
nt|danilo1: anything alerted here (North hand is not reverse) ,,, so 2@D bid looks like style in Polish Club ... or eventually Fiori Romano|pg||

nt|athene: declarer did well to pick the diamond position|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chmitty: next :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: looks as though north likely to lose three clubs and @HQ in 4@H here|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|djneill:  fiori romano - @c+ another 2-suiter I think?|pg||
nt|barbyh: weve got Benito Garozzo in the USA|pg||
nt|athene: i guess we will see the same start here :) but now west bids 3nt|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: yes, amazing coincidence|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if east decides to lead passively, say a diamond, i suppose you might just cash the @HAK intending to try to set up spades for a club pitch|pg||
nt|danilo1: in Fiori Roano, 2@C was three-suiter .. thk we need some basis for NS system|pg||
nt|chmitty: lollll|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: ok so now i am really puzzled what 2nt meant last hand :) haha|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: probably next 3NT by South ... some work but believe she will bring it home|pg||
mb|3N|nt|barbyh: alight opener by east may get them into trouble|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Yes You have many famous peoples from all world in your country|pg||
nt|barbyh: sorry south opened|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i think it meant " whos the boss here, eh?"|pg||

nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|athene: well, people do, in practice|pg||
nt|athene: might not be allowed to put it on your convention card tho :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: @D lead not improbable|pg||
nt|chmitty: @c lead immediately brings the 9th trick|pg||
nt|danilo1: believe Berndt wil lead @D or @S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barbyh: its 2 am here not quite awake|pg||
nt|chmitty: on a @s lead, you must decide to play on @h rather than @c I believe|pg||
nt|chmitty: difficult lead for declarer|pg||
nt|danilo1: wit no clue .. difficult to believe Joanna wil not try double @C finess ... still - lot of thinking now expected - since allso communication problems|pg||
nt|chmitty: well ... you can take in hand and play Ace @h and @h|pg||
pc|sA|nt|danilo1: but maybe, South treated her hand as three-suiter|pg||
nt|chmitty: ok with @h 33 or K10 / Q10 doubleton|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: say @DQ, @HAK, then if both defenders follow but no @HQ appeared, you would go @SA, spade ruff, @DA, spade ruff, but you need something very good to happen in spades|pg||
nt|chmitty: In French we would say "ils ont été pris avec les doigts dans le pot de confiture"|pg||
nt|ritong: or east, having felt pain with 2NT previous hand, did not want to inflict the same to her pard  very noble|pg||
nt|athene: a slightly odd hand here in that the defence do best to attack declarer's five-card suit, rather than their own :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: "caught with the fingers in the marmelade pot"|pg||
nt|athene: of course if declarer guesses the @SQ she is home anyway|pg||
nt|athene: but if NS don't play clubs fairly soon, she might survive a misguess there|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep but that's against the odds|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|santyclz: @h lead is the 9th trick. 1 1 2 5|pg||

nt|chmitty: now you can bid 3@s|pg||

mb|6H|nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to have a look, if you have the methods|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@C is Bue Club Fiori Napoletano) stile .. 1@C 17+ and 1@S = 3 controls (3K or A+K)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: in Poland very popular was conventional 1NT in defence bidding, which show 5m+4M|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  1@c roman, 1N positive but NF|pg||
nt|danilo1: at least 1@C looks like Fiori Romano |pg||
nt|ritong: the idea is to find @ss, and at max level|pg||
nt|chmitty: Everytime a "normal" hand, compatible with the bidding, makes a grand slam, you have to consider the small one |pg||

nt|danilo1: * or polish @C|pg||
nt|djneill:  6 sure tricks, 1@s, 2@h, 2@c, 1@d|pg||
nt|athene: a good example here of how a 4-4 fit can produce more tricks than a 5-4 or even 6-4 fit|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s looks healthy at that point|pg||
pc|s7|nt|djneill:  @c is likely to come in if 3-3 or @c honor sing/doub|pg||
nt|chmitty: One solution is to adopt a double relay sequence (2@c limited and 2@d game force) in theses situations|pg||
nt|chmitty: these*|pg||
nt|chmitty: everytime the 2@c bid is "free" (not only after a 1NT rebid from opener) you can use it|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@h isn't automatic, but it gives pd a chance to raise on a borderline hand with 3 card @h supt.|pg||
nt|chmitty: must show @h as well, I would say from West's action !!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chmitty: there it sould go : North 2@c, South 2@d (forced) North 2@h : around 10 Hcp with 5@h|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chmitty: A quite good 7@s : you make 13 tricks in the 44 fit|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|chmitty: very remote possiblites|pg||
nt|chmitty: double finesse K10 @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: plus some endplay in @c|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chmitty: think about it : of course it has a few inconvenients, but so many advantages :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: When @s are 32|pg||
nt|athene: yes, pretty much needs 3-2 spades or stiff jack|pg||
nt|athene: if you cash the @SAK and east shows out, you can pick them up, but it's no use|pg||
pc|h8|nt|djneill:  since West led 4th best @s, probably West has no other 4crd suit so no point to finessing round 1 I think|pg||
nt|athene: because you can't get a ruff in either hand for the thirteenth trick|pg||
nt|athene: of course it's a good job north is playing 7@S :) otherwise lightner double would be quite effective|pg||
nt|chmitty: Very tough bidding exercice with  natural methods : when you have discovered a @h fit, you hardly can investigate an alternative one in @s|pg||
nt|ritong: clearly so, yes|pg||
nt|chmitty: ans no losing @h of course|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: well, it's not certain by any means they will find even the small slam in the other room|pg||

nt|chmitty: on 22, they are playing a doomed 3NT|pg||

nt|bebechira: i wonder what is 3c?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|djneill:  should West try 3@h here, East can be quite solid red vs white|pg||

nt|chmitty: not forcing ? not common nowdays|pg||
nt|chmitty: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c took care of the first king, and 2@d about the other|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that lauria's methods oblige him to pass that hand over the double |pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: would 1NT be adequate now with west'a hand ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  even 4@s|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. 3@H is free to try .. since he ca calmly correct to 4@C (depends on agreement, good partenrships would have escape if ps shorth)|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok|pg||
nt|djneill:  East has so many losers, hard to imagine 5@c|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@H surely discourage 5@C bid - East must pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: Shades of the 1950s.|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose if hearts come back to him at a reasonable level he will double|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep|pg||
nt|chmitty: supposed to be 18-19 ... here it's 20 but a "bad" 20|pg||
nt|chmitty: as long as you can consider that a 20 count hand can be bad :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|djneill:  brd 22 another of the 1NT in one room 3NT in other|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|athene: yes, your only long suit is 4 cards in openers's suit and not much strength|pg||
nt|athene: that reduces the playing strength quite considerably|pg||

mb|1C|nt|djneill:  only 3 game bids in 9 boards, hmm|pg||

nt|barbyh: haha|pg||
nt|chmitty: strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  3@s good @h raise|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: looking on this now he should pass|pg||
nt|bebechira: seams reasonable to open with how many aces you have|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 kings not good|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no aces no opening bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: meanwhile calandra piling up the imps|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: 3nt not much fun here on a heart lead, but you might be forced to take the double club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: it's OK to double 2@D just to show cards, but you need to know what your next double means|pg||
nt|athene: opps are sure to bid something in a major|pg||
nt|athene: so when you double THAT, is it penalty or takeout? and is pass forcing?|pg||
nt|danilo1: no entries for North so no problem in probable 3NT |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|danilo1: Canape ... even if I have it in system, not sure I would open 1@H here :)|pg||
nt|athene: west can set diamonds and ask for keycards then the @CK, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: and stop when it's missing|pg||
nt|chmitty: yes ... I doubt Bocchi will produce the @sJ lead :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ritong: apparently west has a doubt about 3@d being forcing  tha's quite amazing|pg||
nt|athene: well, if you don't want to bid 3@D, how about 4@D?|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, west can bid 4nt now, if that is blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S might be a reasonable spot, but hard to get there|pg||
nt|djneill:  so South's Pass may have been forcing since North showed a strong game hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  if so North is encouraged to bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: over 4@S, I would surely bid 5@H here (would not be in same situation - as said before)|pg||

nt|ritong: an other interesting hand, on a theoretical plan|pg||

nt|athene: worried about the hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|queequeg: @S@SA special thanks to Italian Bridge Federation for organizing this Vugraph|pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@Sthank you also to our fantastic Operator Daniela Nante :) Well done!|pg||
nt|athene: or whether it's showing good hearts, trying to put opps off the lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@h supposed to mean : I have a @h stopper, but a problem with @c ... |pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@s in this situation means primarily : I have no @h stopper|pg||
nt|chmitty: now, as kibs react ... let me say that this is the FIRST meaning of both 3@h and 3@s bids|pg||
nt|ritong: for us french|pg||
pc|c3|nt|queequeg: Next match is starting in about 2 hours 20 minutes (21.00 local time)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|queequeg: I can remember a nice article in one bridge newspaper about a board played by Dano De Falco|pg||
nt|queequeg: and the title was "timeo Dano..." :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chmitty: of course, if you make another bid later on, that might show a @d support, for instance|pg||
nt|chmitty: and an interest for slam|pg||
nt|ritong: these situations are a huge source of accidents|pg||
nt|ritong: so, one has to instate reliable guides|pg||
nt|chmitty: Henri is right : this is our French standard ... might be different here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ritong: one reliable guide could be: first target is 3NT|pg||
nt|chmitty: agree ... a very classic situation anyhow, which must be discussed in a partnership|pg||
nt|ritong: so, bids at the three level basically tend to determine if this spot is viable or not|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|queequeg: the author was Marco Catellani if I remember well|pg||
