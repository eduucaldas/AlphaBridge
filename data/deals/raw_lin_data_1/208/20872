pc|sT|nt|migry: 5@d would have asked for the Q@S|pg||
nt|migry: and the second step confirms all key cards|pg||
nt|mrt2000: he found it|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to lose the lead in @hs no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a second round of trumps would be clumsy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he certainly plans to lead a @h towards QJ asap  the question is, does the timing demand a ruff before that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sorry -- says Rodwell -- and put his cards on the table |pg||
nt|migry: easiest would be to try and ruff 2 clubs in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  achesslike hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: an other solution can be @h hook then Xruff|pg||

nt|ritong: i think his play simplified matters with @s9 in north|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|c7|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: and for those of you thinking about an operator error -- forget it -- not this time :)|pg||

nt|phil: annoying result - but normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hello Phil|pg||
nt|kfay: South has kind of an interesting decision on this hand.  It's pretty vogue these days to bid 1N-3N with 4333 distribution even if you have a 4cM simply because your hand probably ...|pg||
nt|kfay: isn't worth any extra tricks in a suit contract.  But I could see how it might easily be wrong on this hand if partner has 4 spades since his cards are Aces and Kings, which are a ...|pg||
nt|kfay: little more 'suity.'  I know plenty of people who worry about whether their partner would have a doubleton heart in that|pg||
nt|phil: hi Gerbrand :)|pg||

nt|kfay: to find a killing lead if you end up in 3NT anyway on a lot of hands since they have more information available to them.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ew lead 4th best it seems|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia gained a small swing by beating both 3H this rom and 4D other room on  3.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: I didnt hear it |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@D probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm, I would deem the south hand good enough for 1nt directly but we shall see.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton threatened a double if Fisher balanced, so he quickly passed|pg||
nt|kareno: Part scores are the heart and soul of long matches.|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's aggressive unless you upgaded the QJxx in spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: The team that does best on those hands usually wins.  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I do.  And I confess to aggressive bidding, especially vulnerable :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrt2000: A@C from E works wonders!|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: agree.  Two teams both with average ages below 30 are fighting for the top places in tis event.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|migry: NS play standard carding with a lot of suit preference|pg||

nt|fabsayc: so the atmosphere is very friendly then :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|yuval10: very tough here for E, if he's wrong to play small @d and S has the K@d singel the damage is really big|pg||

nt|yuval10: note that S played the 6@c over the 3@c ruff , and not the 2|pg||

nt|kareno: Youth must be served - that is true of at least one team in the BB final!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|s8|nt|gracelin: West found the most damaging H lead, but when declarer ducked twice, he has not enough entries to establish it.|pg||

pc|d4|nt|kfay: A kib mentions that some pairs have gadgetry available to show exactly 4333 or 3433 distribution.  I think that's usually accomplished with 1N-3M or something like that.  Who knows ...|pg||
nt|kfay: what's actually best but I personally have had a few good experiences hiding information with 1N-3N, when I've decided to be 'modern' and bid that way.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|gracelin: really ? from a redouble ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: yeah, big misunderstanding apparently|pg||
nt|kareno: I know what generates it but I haven't seen one in forever, Patrick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if declarer plays DQ here, he can even endplay East to make an overtrick|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|gracelin: 1NT from Hans, they only open 11-14 1NT on 1/2 seats|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzpf: I even believe that Transnationals started at 10.00 :) --|pg||
nt|migry: NS play a very weak preemptive style so 1NT is 8+ to bad 12|pg||
nt|migry: sry - overcall style|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: What is your carding here - asks Rosenberg -- Upside down says Meckstroth|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|phil: 4@s is a little aggro, but the 5th spade, and round honors are nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz showed his 4 aces first :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: an Spec notes that if east discards a diamon instead of a club declarer has another guess to make as well|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@s for me is supper agro, I reopen 3@d with 8 HCP at this vul, he could be playing some 17 HCP game sometimes  _ |pg||
nt|kfay: 4@s looks like a good way to prevent partner from balancing in the future, for me.|pg||
nt|phil: same|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kareno: 2nt is apparently club puppet.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East obviously can't bid a natural 2C and needs to use 2NT to transfer to 3C.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north is thinking of bidding 3D, he sould bid 2D last round|pg||
mb|3D|nt|migry: i must admit i would have bid 2@h with south over 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: which woulld make i believe|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and I would have bid 2@H, not 1|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on the first round|pg||
nt|migry: depends on the style - i would prefer a different hand for a weak jump overcall |pg||
nt|migry: better suit, less defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: if i was tempted to do anything, it would be bid 3nt with south hand|pg||
nt|kareno: North perhaps considering re-entering the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: still @d10xx is a great holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: mainly because north wont have much outside of spades and hence minor values of use more in 3nt|pg||
nt|kareno: And so he was - east has done his share here.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D  is -2 but no loss against the makeable 3C.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|phil: if you play partner for 7-8 when you compete over a preempt (and raise to 4@s yourself) you'll do OK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|migry: that was an unexpected discard by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: And Rosenberg did ask to see it twice|pg||
nt|yuval10: here W has a super-maximum and of course was driven to game after E invited. looks perfectly normal, especially when they're red|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia lost a game swing on the 3NT hand.  Declarer didn't need to find the SK unblock since suth led a H.|pg||
nt|kareno: At the highest level, part scores are contested hard.  Those relatively small IMPs add up.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gracelin: yes, no problem for NS to be pushed to 3D on their 9-card fit.  But I prefer north to bid 2D earier and south 3D over 3C.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kfay: That's true.  But what's the big rush non-vulnerable?  |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|kfay: Maybe he was influenced by three not-so-great boards so far this set.|pg||

mb|d!|an|3!S|mb|3N|nt|petergill: It does, shows exactly 4 or 5 spades|pg||

mb|4H|nt|dan_ehh: nice 3N bid|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: probably wouldn't make, but a good try|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl was a support dbl with 3 spades. 4@HX plays better than 4@SX, but South is likely to give pref to spades, though 1@H denied 6 spades, so 4@H = 5/5 shape. |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is natural, 5/5, cannot have 6 spades, else would bid 2@H transfer over 1@D|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dan_ehh: a phantom over a phantom|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Defence to 3Nt on @h lead is very tough - S wins first @H and must switch to @s then back to @H then back to @S - so good 4@H bid by Paul Gosney|pg||

nt|petergill: Dan, you must defend like Garozzo - or is the expression nowadays "defend like Padon"?- to think 4@h is a phantom |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: Peter, you've described Gosney's hand very accurately, and south knows this info too|pg||

nt|gracelin: 3NT by West is fine. |pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzpf: 3@H = 5card@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: need near ouble dummy defense to beat it, i.e. 2 round of H ended n south and spade shift.|pg||

mb|d|nt|phil: as long as he doesnt wear a leisure suit at the table|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, we'll see how this plays out.  South doubles with clubs locked up.|pg||

nt|gracelin: S9|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yuval10: where the @s's are defended|pg||
nt|kareno: And perhaps looking for a heart lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: although here, north is known a priori with 2@h and at most 3@s|pg||

nt|mrt2000: so, is a @S lead not indicates?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indicated|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so, but maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: pard is supposed to hold at least 4, right|pg||
nt|migry: i thought europeans like to lead 3 card suits in these sequences, don't they Henri?|pg||
nt|fluffy: thdefence has to play trumps or diamonds to prevent declarer from discarding a diamong on @cQ and ruffing all spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: on the other hand, better lead your own suits than the inferred ones with pard, most of the time|pg||
nt|kareno: The game of chicken has ended right here :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: With that lead, west should make this.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yuval10: yet still, a @c lead and a @s switch looks tricky , if you play 6@d. you have to ruff 2 @h's and you have no entry for the K@c in dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: if gosney had avoided the spade lead declarer would still make with help of heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Israel has a carry over of 5 imps going into this match, so they really have 14, not 9. Score will be updated for the next segment.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: i have no idea about that, mig|pg||
nt|gracelin: depend on their areement, but normally, a spade.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: perhaps with rubbish|pg||
nt|ritong: tryi_ng to hit pard with entries|pg||
nt|fluffy: but that's just for the overtrick 3@s can't be beaten|pg||
nt|phil: right|pg||
pc|d5|nt|migry: apparently something happened in the other room and the Angelini team gets a 6imps penalty|pg||
nt|yuval10: all academic when they stopped in the sensible contract of 3NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|migry: and some more action over there|pg||
nt|migry: a mobile phone rang in the other room|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|phil: the only relevant decision was actually stopping in 3|pg||

nt|vugraphzpe: director at the table whole match as always in the finals|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by Israel to 6@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@d made due to the 2-2 @d split|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dan_ehh: 6@D makig is an impressive result|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dan_ehh: bit lucky I would say|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but can't complain|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|petergill: spade lead beats both 7NT and 7@D as the cards lie|pg||
nt|yuval10: without a @s lead 6@d seem cold, but a @s lead takes a vital entry from dummy|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|yuval10: still you can make 6@d with a 2-2 @d split, or 3-1 @d and JX @h in one of the sides, or K@c singelton... |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 4@C is a lead directing bid on the way to 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C shows @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dan_ehh: the Australian pair in the other room only bid up to 3@S, leaving some room for the Israelis|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@d would have shown clubs - they are not transfers - it's simply that the 3@C and 3@D bids are switched, so that you can rightside contracts|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but 4@SX seems to be -1100|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|petergill: A surprise pick-up for Australia is likely|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||

nt|petergill: I didn't think of that @D option to get partner on lead for @H plays :(|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kfay: I'm informed that the team that finished higher in the Swiss between the two losing semi-finalists is awarded 3rd place.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|3S|nt|migry: 2@s is a normal opening with 6 clubs|pg||
nt|migry: and 2@d asks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|migry: 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s= more than minumum - no 4card Major|pg||
nt|ritong: nor 4@h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 3@d looks like E will take command|pg||
nt|yuval10: after he'll ask for aces and see 3 from Partner ( including K@d ) he can count to 13 and bid 7NT with ease|pg||
nt|kfay: Seems like a pretty good system to me.  I've played in two bronze-medal matches in my life (one courtesy of North-South) and I can tell you they're pretty tough to play.  Although|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6D for NS.  Declarer can afford to lose a trump unless West lead spade to take away dummy's entry for club discard.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ritong: which certainly was meck's hope at start|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: unclear about the nature of the 3@d bid, but if it showed and extra then it won't be so tough i guess|pg||
nt|kfay: it is nice to go away with something rather than nothing.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrt2000: 3@C is where you'd want to play, I think|pg||
nt|phil: seems hard to keep up your intensity for a 3/4 match|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Guess they will be there.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mrt2000: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: in  7 angelini passed a 1c opening and everybody was upset |pg||
nt|ritong: he seems to be allergic to fines|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would probably have loved to ask RKCB right away , but was affraid that 4NT over 3@d would be quantitive, as EW didn't agreed on a suit yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another optomistic auction, with red queens onside has a chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact Diamonds are 2-2, so only a spade lead will hold it to six.|pg||
mb|6D|nt|migry: the director was called (again) and not sure what's happenin to that board |pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor the 3@s bid was good in removing all doubts|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: and there you have it|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 3@s might be already too high if the defence is sound|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: And based on the Swiss standings the loser of this match will be the 4th-place finisher.  So if they want some hardware they've got to win here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they're juniors, we shouldn't expect anything less from them|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: scored as passout up to that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Birman advising Willenken to lead his ace|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry Karen, I need to go and will leave the table to you.  |pg||
nt|kareno: And naturally, here it is|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks for being here, Patrick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: bye and good lucks eveyone.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yuval10: not even a 3@s bid by South in the OR stopped EW from bidding slam, when West found a 4@d bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|migry: so for now board  7 was skipped and they r playing  8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 7 scored as a pass|pg||
nt|migry: which explains the "passed out" score|pg||
nt|migry: the board haven't been played yet|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, let s leave that into director's capable hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Padon asking 'how many you have, 17?'|pg||
nt|yuval10: 15 only|pg||

nt|yuval10: 4@h is very marginal and could've gone down in a @c lead from S but J@d lead is totally natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dan_ehh: surprising turn of events|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: robert, what is the oz NT range|pg||

pc|d2|nt|yuval10: 4NT of course would be easy, with 4@s 1@h 3@d and 2@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: in 6NT you have to guess the red suit which is seemingly impossible|pg||

pc|dA|nt|fluffy: now there is a chance they never find hearts|pg||

nt|oosmanb: So I missed a few cards here, but it looks like he can eliminate @D and then play @S up and pray?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and therefore not the @CA|pg||
nt|kareno: The queen would speak louder for spades.  I suspect the ten meant clubs.  North known to have the queen.|pg||

nt|yuval10: and here's another grand slam, very interesting boards this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: some of the new technology looks pretty interesting as a monitor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they ask BBO operators if there, and players normally call director to watch time|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: West keeps getting these long @d hands|pg||
mb|1N|nt|migry: overcall or pass with the south hand?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: any good partnership would get to 4@H after a 1@H opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@C= Game forcing -- maybe only 2@cs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (when I'm playing and that happens I get really annoyed why they arent @S )|pg||
mb|d|an|!S + another|nt|kareno: 4 of a major depends on either club onside or hearts breaking.  Neither will happen and without mirrors for the heart suit, game will go down.|pg||
mb|r!|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I don't like to have short spades either, Oosman :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: OR if the 3@H hand also had 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: East starting an escape sequence.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and you have tempo to pitch the @D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but assuming @d lead that's never going to happen|pg||
mb|2C!|an|p/c|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no beer card when i was a junior, not even a diet cola card|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however isnt there eliminiation in play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 2 rounds of @D and what does West exit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: That would work in hearts but not spades. |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: spade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yeah I'm playing 4@H |pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D some kind of heart raise i suppose, but an unusual one with only 3 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Unless East leads a brilliant @C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||

nt|kareno: A diamond lead will let it make :)|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yuval10: they made it through easily after the 4@s bid|pg||

pc|d5|nt|vugraphzpf: so - Board 7 seems to have been scored as a "draw"|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c6|nt|kareno: Excellent result for Israel.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Doesnt need the finesse, specially when its presented free|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: the explanation is 1nt response to 1@H is only semi-forcing, so he does not have the option of 1NT followed by 3@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|dan_ehh: seems like a nice treatment|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: ah, it would be @Ds|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: they play "transfer advances" after their own overcall in most situations|pg||

nt|ritong: show both majors if possible, then insist on @ss?|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c = @s-suit AND either @h or @c|pg||
nt|migry: either show spade shortness or clubs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mrt2000: in fact, I suspect it takes a @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c was probably a sort of "Drury", and now W is in with a @h and a minor bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7NT in the OR as well, good match we have so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2NT would've been a weaker hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: cue bid to show max raise|pg||
mb|2H|nt|phil: hopefully they have the tools to find the 503 heart fit here|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 4nt now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: now S would probably bid 4@s with max and @d support|pg||
nt|phil: 5-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: They should stop in 2@h, the limit of the hand.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mrt2000: possibly|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oooops|pg||
nt|ritong: north has not passed yet|pg||
nt|ritong: by large|pg||
nt|migry: what wd u do with north?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why would N remove the X?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: looks like they do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Im curious why West didnt dbl 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: looks like berkowitz wrote down> 5crd Major|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W, I'm sure, probably have some discretion as to whether they can call an 8-cout a bad 8 (and bid 1@d) or a good 8 (and bid something else).  This is definitely a bad 8.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fisher has inferred his partner has spades stopped as gosney bid hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does that show something else|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if bidding again, I would prefer 4NT from S|pg||
nt|kareno: Again, west is competing for the all-important partscore.  Matches are so often won by an accumulation of part-score swings.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: perhaps its take out of @H's, which he doesn't have without @D's|pg||
pc|d6|nt|migry: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = doesn't want @h lead i guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: transfering to berkowitz sounds ugly, but I think its just part of the system|pg||
nt|kareno: That could be.  Depends on their agreements.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: A@S on and a @h ruff in dummy is all he needs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fluffy: they probably just play the same when 1NT is weak|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: i dont usually thank dummy but this one is worth a special thanks, just perfect|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kfay: I guess they must play something like 3@d=min 5@H, 3@H = max 5@H, 3@s = min 5@S, 3N = max 5@s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz has left the room, so we'll wait a couple mins|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yuval10: possible misunderstandning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: NS chatting 'you should have two without @SQ|pg||
nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||
nt|migry: for @d and @s|pg||
nt|migry: with the Q@d being a specific king|pg||
nt|yuval10: anyways they got one level too high|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kareno: The diamond lead could be a problem for west.  He needs to duck it or lose a promotion in clubs.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|fluffy: be careful with all thos transfers, some ladies ended up in -3400 in the venice cup RR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: EW referring to the dutch ladies, with the 4@Hxx for 3400|pg||
nt|oosmanb: notice the small/10@h play to keep communication|pg||
pc|d9|nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
nt|migry: so 5@s doubled looks normal|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, it would push EW t|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have 5@s and a stiff @h -- if thats helps you ---says Rodwell|pg||
nt|mrt2000: to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Rosenberg answars -- that doesnt help me a lot |pg||
nt|phil: pass of 4@d is useful as  - I dont have a diamond control - you play it|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kareno: Of course, declarer may ruff high on the next diamond and finesse in clubs to neutralize north's ten.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: going to be testing though|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kareno: (actually the clubs are good enough to stand the pressure.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That was a loser on loesr play, but what about the next @D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: 1 down and 10 imps for the juniors|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kfay: 4@d was obviously a transfer and it led to a pretty interesting situation about how to handle the double.  There's a famous hand played by Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss a year ago ...|pg||
nt|kfay: where they had a Texas transfer auction where Brad redoubled, intending it to say 'you play 4M.' Fred passed and I think the final contract was 4@HXX down a lot.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kareno: Ruff high, hearts to ruff in dummy and hope for 3-2 clubs.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Or an inspired @c finesse which would also work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so wont go wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher asked Schwartz to overruff..|pg||

nt|kfay: And redouble would show a hand that's willing to compete if the opponents take a sacrifice.  Presumably a hand that strong wouldn't mind if responder HAS to play 4M.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher said @S are 3-3, Berkowitz, that's not fun :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|oosmanb: Israel juniors picked up 9 for their 6@d effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Yeah well that particular hand was definintely a pretty surprising result.  I think it was in the semifinals or finals of the USBF versus the Fleisher team.|pg||
nt|phil: precisionesque 2@d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yuval10: a lot of action in the OR where NS already bids to the making 3NT, but EW bided them out of it|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|fluffy: berkowitz can envision 12 tricks if partner has a perfect hand, but soon he will see there is no luck today|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: would have to be a remarkable minimum|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|oosmanb: Not too many tricks for declarer here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|migry: it is|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 10 imps will quickly come back to the Gordon team|pg||
nt|kareno: No, a spade raise would have been more useful.  (or a pass by east over 1@c)|pg||
nt|kareno: Blocking play by declarer.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South has an entry, so he'll cash AK@H and use their signalling method to show @D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzpf: E still thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks normal, but this time dummy does not have the required stopper in unbid suit, and 5@D was easy make|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or that :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: duck is superior.. partner doesnt have to discard twice for no reason|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrt2000: well bid NS|pg||
nt|kfay: I think the usual explanation for the 2@D bid is something like "4415 minus a card".  So you could be (43)15 or 4405, etc.|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack of clubs I assume now.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||

pc|d4|pc|h9|pg||

nt|fluffy: I do, but I also play a rule that says don't underlead aces|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh right @d7 must be from A875 sorry|pg||
nt|kfay: I know what you mean, but the Ace was marked on this hand.  Wouldn't be so if the @d10 and the @d2 were switched, I guess.  Maybe Schwartz got lucky.  Or maybe Fisher would have ...|pg||
nt|kfay: gone up K anyway|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|yuval10: here NS in the OR did well to bid to a marginal game|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kfay: Personally I would have just blasted 4@H with Berkowitz's hand but he has way more experience with the 2@d than I, and I'm sure he had some really good reasons.|pg||
nt|phil: or - transfer the club threat to E and N is guard squeezed - only if declarer would have unblocked the @s8 earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2@d = raise in @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@d = mixed raise in @c|pg||
nt|fluffy: fisher has a double fit!|pg||
nt|phil: of sorts LOL|pg||
nt|kfay: Likely he was looking for a good slam.|pg||
nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: although he might have checked out with 4@h once partner shows a min|pg||
nt|fluffy: passive leads would make 4@h a make, but there are no apssive leads on this hand, and whatever lead but a trump if continued ends up beating 4@h|pg||
nt|kfay: I don't think it's really emphasized enough that this 2@H bid really shows a very nice hand opposite Fisher's pass.  I've seen a lot of 2@Hs thrown out just because opener is 5-4 ...|pg||
nt|kfay: and that is not a good way to play.  You'll get a lot of punishment.  That's why Fisher's thinking here because I'm sure he knows his partner is reliable.|pg||
nt|phil: especially when partner is already prone to respond light|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kfay: This is another good example of how the 4-4 plays better than the 5-3 since a losing @d can be pitched on the long spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's fine - three hearts and a diamond to lose on a heart lead.|pg||

nt|petergill: did not expect trump ace to be singleton for the dbl|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: the players do not see all 52 cards. however it seems that if @Hs break 3-2 then Edgtton can't go down, so he should have guarded against a bad break|pg||

nt|kareno: Wow!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz content with his 800 on the previous board, staying out of trouble here..|pg||
nt|kareno: Discreet pass by north.  But 4@h is a decent contract (and can be made with mirrors if no club lead.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oosmanb: 4@h not a bad contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But he didnt like his K@S and so didnt dbl|pg||
nt|kareno: This is likely to be down one and could be a pickup if n/s bid 4@h in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he probably didn't favour the colours|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|kfay: Double partscore swings are really underrated at IMPs, usually.  People talk about gameswings and not going for numbers but the 6s and 7s available really add up.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ritong: should we try a " cooperative" 3@h?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|yuval10: E can play J@d in the 2nd round also, but that'd be tough|pg||

nt|kfay: They lead A from AK below the 5-level unless shifting to a singleton...|pg||
nt|kfay: A friend of mine once told me of his idea that from AKQ ace should ace for attitude, king for count, and queen for suit preference.  But there's not really any way Berkowitz would ...|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|fluffy: this lead will lead to -460 quickly|pg||
nt|kfay: Well I guess since 1@H could be 4 maybe this is a poor example.|pg||
nt|kfay: But say it guaranteed 5 I believe it's best to bid 2@C in response to 1@H with that shape (4324 and a game force) simply to have a more efficient auction.|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: most welcome, I might be back next session|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Perhaps the 1@SX a couple of boards ago had some psychological effect|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kareno: Yes, precisely.  But he will get his partscore equity (if any) from this contract.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kfay: If you bid 1@s and partner bids 2@d you have the nightmare scenario of having to force with 3@C and hoping you can agree hearts (unambiguously) by the 3-level.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kfay: It's a lot easier just to bid 2@c and be assured you can get your hearts in cheaply later.|pg||
nt|kfay: If partner has 4 spades, he'll bid them anyway and you can still get to your 4-4.|pg||
nt|kfay: OK, exciting match.  Remember that Gordon currently has a 7-IMP lead.|pg||
