nt|ahollan1: with 4333 empty 10   easy to see why deWijs didn't invite|pg||
nt|brolucius: When you need a maximum opposite to be in 3NT, the odds are not good. With a 15-17 point range, for example, a 15-count is almost exactly twice as likely as a 17-count.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That may seem amazing, but it is true.|pg||

nt|brolucius: West might have ventured a double of 5@H, but who are we to question his judgement?|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think  3@D would be slam try in @C   |pg||
nt|brolucius: Constructive bidding over a 2@C opening (which has already used up a level of bidding) is a well known weakness of 1@C systems.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough here   i think 4@D would be RKC   so 4N quantitative   but don't quote me|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 4nt?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@C goes down on bad trump split|pg||

nt|rhelle: if you look at the NS hands of board 17 in isolation, and you'd give a score in a bidding competition, you score 10 for 1NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c: you have a sure @d loser, and a 2nd @s loser if the @dA is wrong. So not so great ...|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|ady: problems|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rhelle: now declarer has some problems, and needs to start looking for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: now what ?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd say, start by setting up a 2nd @s trick and advance the @s J|pg||
nt|ady: K@D best chance  |pg||
nt|ady: I think needs an error in defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: East has to duck, otherwise you have another entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ady: J@S   east can just win and return a heart  and no problem then for defence|pg||
nt|ady: does not have to duck   just clear hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: many ways home from here|pg||
nt|rhelle: I hear various lines of play from the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|rhelle: To be honest, I'm not sure about any of them|pg||
nt|sybarra: but so much easier from this vantage point, dont you think?|pg||
nt|ady: wests play of 10@H  seems odd    maybe a view graph error|pg||
nt|rhelle: Declarer has noted the @h discard on the 1st @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no error, W started @H 10...|pg||
nt|ady: well seems to be an error in defence  10@H lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: Where are the points? the 3rd hand 1@h doesn't promise the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Muller thinking of every possible distribution,  knowing the @C and (maybe) hts|pg||
nt|frankaus: even from  up here the way forward is not clear|pg||
nt|frankaus: all the kibs and gib make it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller is trying to work out why East played @H9 at Trick 1. With QJ98x, East would overtake @H10, in case it was a singleton.|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer seems to have 9 tricks; 3@c, 2@d, 2@h, 2@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: but how to get them before the defence has 5?|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome petergill|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Peter |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||

nt|petergill: West's @HQ lead fooled everyone|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||

nt|sybarra: does he have the @D spots for that?|pg||
nt|rhelle: but it won't help, as then when West wins the trick, he can't play @h|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Joel Wooldridge's thinking with Q10 doubleton was that if partner has @HJ, leading the ten makes little difference to lead the ten, and if S has @HJ, then @HQ will score an ...|pg||
nt|petergill: unexpected trick over the jack later|pg||
nt|rhelle: so declarer's 4th @d will then become the winning 9th|pg||
nt|ady: but long diamond now good|pg||
nt|sybarra: so will play q of @D and @d |pg||
nt|rhelle: very likely. East is void in @c, so very unlikely the @sK is now singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: ducking a @d now looks safe enough, but S is checking if endplays are possible on other layouts|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: unblock the jack was only chance on @DQ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s7|nt|rhelle: now that East doesn't unblock, exiting with a @h looks safe|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d5|pc|s8|nt|ady: unblcok was best    might have exited with a heart|pg||
nt|petergill: then atfer unblock, if declarer exited a heart - playing East for 4540 shape ---> -1|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|petergill: attitude leads to NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting; there is a double @d finesse as well that can be taken|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|petergill: Yes indeed|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||

nt|warrens:  now declarer hopes to learn something from the discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N can pitch 2 @h's and then one more card (=?) if clubs are run|pg||
nt|warrens:  one reasonable line is a @d to the 9, then try a @D to the Q the next time|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play diamond finesse   for contract|pg||

pc|c7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: yes   that does cater for J10 diamonds onside   but in this case might go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: North not vul has passed over 1@C ---> 5 card suit a bit less likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: but that is only if you know @s are 4-4 ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more doesn't matter much non vul|pg||
nt|rhelle: remember kibitzers, NS play attitude leads. So the @s2 indicates an honour, not length|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: I think W has deliberately timed his club cashing sequence so N has to discard twice before South discards --> N's problem a little bit tougher|pg||
pc|cK|nt|warrens:  @D to the 9, then to the Q is 62.5%, so a @H to the QJ means you're more than 80% sure N has only 4 @S's|pg||
nt|petergill: W from the attitude lead knows N has @SQxxx or @SQxxxx so he wants North to discard before S, as S has easy @s discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N has (cunningly?) kept his @H discard until last, to try to look more like a man with 5332 shape|pg||
nt|rhelle: the big strength of NS is their incredibly tight defence|pg||
nt|petergill: (I think) N knew he had to make 2 more discards, so he released the @D (less comfortable discard) before the @H, to make the position less clear to West. |pg||
nt|petergill: If S releases another @S, W can play @H safely unless N has @HAK |pg||
nt|ady: whats the betting here?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm going for -1 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: red card discard, else this makes easily|pg||
nt|rhelle: but I'm heavily biased|pg||
nt|petergill: I was wrong - spade discard ---> @S can rise @HA on @H of dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: NS first discard   odd = encourage|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, but taking those discards at face value is a direct route to the poorhouse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S point was right, because then @S have broken 4-4, so S cannot throw a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: NS UDCA with 1st discard odd encourage|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H lead in OR    so no problem|pg||
nt|warrens:  we can see by this auction that W's distribution is concealed, making it harder for the defense (and putting us to sleep as we wait)|pg||
nt|petergill: so N's @D6 and @S's @S3 discard were really telling declarer as little as possible|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands might go in front |pg||

nt|ady: must have been a diamond lead  for 12 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D led|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder what 5@S would mean now? Natural, strong slam suggestion?|pg||
nt|ady: I am told it was|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its good to have an agreement what the meaning of 4@S is by west|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|rhelle: even so, nasty problem for West. It could be anything, from 4@s to 7@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: Nor th wil certainly lead the @cA|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 imps to Netherlands, surely|pg||
nt|ady: that  very ambitius  with void heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: look in movie,  it was club lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps 5@S would be voidwood (void spade, loking for 7@H), so West's choices were 4@S and 6@S - a guess. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|warrens:  needs to lead @C Ace or a @S|pg||
nt|rhelle: However, North's second card will be problematic. If it's a @d, it's made|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone says @D,  my movie shows club |pg||
pc|h3|pc|sT|nt|sybarra: will S try 3 @H?|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petergill: I would win the trump and put N to the test by playing @CK at Trick 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  now, N has to rise on a small @C lead from W, which I think is easy to do looking at dummy's @H's|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry bd 30 a diamond |pg||
nt|ady: mine shows a diamond|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: the E hand looks like the ones I have been holding recently |pg||
nt|bbramley: none vul is best for competing - i'm surprised he didn't, altho he already bid twice and his partner was there|pg||
nt|sybarra: enough!! |pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|rhelle: This is though|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: tricky   must play ace|pg||
nt|rhelle: very well played!|pg||
nt|ady: abd must resist diamond|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ady: north was awake|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK at Trick 2 could be a singleton king so might be taken, whereas the low club is more certain to draw the unwelcome ace (if @DK was onside)|pg||
nt|rhelle: South played the @c9, an even number|pg||
nt|warrens:  no way he'll play a @D.  W can't have been missing both minor aces|pg||
nt|rhelle: So my money is on another @c, to try and cut communications|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks like down a couple, but still a good save vs. the 140 that south could make in hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the OR made 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: W always on lead, to probably gives a trick somewhere |pg||
nt|bbramley: they may have gotten desperate trying to beat 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: to=so |pg||
nt|rhelle: both a @c and a @c are good - even a @h works as West can't get rid of 3 @ds|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|dJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|bbramley: vs. 4@H: possible make even against passive defense if declarer reads the position|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|warrens:  I don't believe it.  what was he playing for?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is costly - and North has to be careful to not let it affect him|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: With a long and strong spade suit, South has no intention of penalising a low-level contract and shows his hand type to partner as soon as possible.|pg||

nt|petergill: It was S who erred, not N|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|bbramley: well done - he made it - now that's a good save - so 7 imps and new leader|pg||
mb|r|mb|1N|nt|rhelle: Yes, of course, sorry ... the 9 is an ODD number|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rhelle: whereas South had an EVEN number of Clubs|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this should make |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  So, South meant the 9 to show a @H card and N took it as an odd number|pg||
nt|drewsky: It all depends on their defensive agreements...if the 9 of @C was count, then south erred. However, many experts us tend to play suit prefernce|pg||
nt|rhelle: fortunately, NS will sit out the next session|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: I think N played W for AKQJxxxxx void x Kxx, but that seems unlikely on the bidding - but he has to trust his partner's count card|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|bbramley: @C9 is a handy card here|pg||
nt|ady: diamond could never be right   unless his partner had the ace    which seems impossible|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c6|nt|bbramley: he'll get at least 4 spades and 1 of each, probably an extra club when west tries to cash them|pg||

pc|h2|pc|s6|pg||
