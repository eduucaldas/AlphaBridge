nt|vugraphzpf: 'mildly invitational with not good spades' is now wat R'berg says loudly|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|mrt2000: although a @S lead from N would be tricky|pg||
nt|migry: was wondering what would be "normal play" on a @c lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the preempt seems to have stolen the board, 4@H will make NS|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|migry: sry - on a @h lead|pg||
nt|migry: spade is tricky|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to ruff twice on the same side to come up to 12, at first sight|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h+2@c+1@d implies 6 @s tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|migry: and work on the hearts- probably hearts 3-3 will make it easy|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@h asks for Kings|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|s2|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d8|nt|migry: 5@d would have asked for the Q@S|pg||
nt|migry: and the second step confirms all key cards|pg||
nt|mrt2000: he found it|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to lose the lead in @hs no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a second round of trumps would be clumsy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he certainly plans to lead a @h towards QJ asap  the question is, does the timing demand a ruff before that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sorry -- says Rodwell -- and put his cards on the table |pg||
nt|migry: easiest would be to try and ruff 2 clubs in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  achesslike hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: an other solution can be @h hook then Xruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N's 7@S could grow up quickly here|pg||
nt|migry: can't make it now as he will have to give a @h and that little @s7|pg||

pc|c9|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but i would think twice before questioning a rodwell's play:)|pg||

nt|ritong: especially when it does not consist in second play low|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I wasn't questioning, just onserving  :)|pg||

nt|ritong: i think his play simplified matters with @s9 in north|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|d4|pc|s6|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: and for those of you thinking about an operator error -- forget it -- not this time :)|pg||

nt|petergill: other favoured teams: Sweden, Parimatch (Russia, lost s/f to Australia), Gordon (lost s/f to Israel) and Mahaffey (Pepsi - Kwiecen, Seamon etc)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: I think Oz open was a favourite, or at least an outsider, being so close to qualify for quarters of BB|pg||

nt|yuval10: E would probably have loved to ask RKCB right away , but was affraid that 4NT over 3@d would be quantitive, as EW didn't agreed on a suit yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another optomistic auction, with red queens onside has a chance|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ritong: scored as passout up to that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Birman advising Willenken to lead his ace|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: not even a 3@s bid by South in the OR stopped EW from bidding slam, when West found a 4@d bid|pg||
pc|sT|nt|migry: so for now board  7 was skipped and they r playing  8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 7 scored as a pass|pg||

nt|yuval10: and here's another grand slam, very interesting boards this set|pg||
mb|1H|nt|phil: some of the new technology looks pretty interesting as a monitor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they ask BBO operators if there, and players normally call director to watch time|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|migry: overcall or pass with the south hand?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: any good partnership would get to 4@H after a 1@H opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@C= Game forcing -- maybe only 2@cs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no beer card when i was a junior, not even a diet cola card|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D some kind of heart raise i suppose, but an unusual one with only 3 trumps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||

nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||

nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fisher has inferred his partner has spades stopped as gosney bid hearts|pg||

mb|2C|nt|kfay: Personally I would have just blasted 4@H with Berkowitz's hand but he has way more experience with the 2@d than I, and I'm sure he had some really good reasons.|pg||
nt|phil: or - transfer the club threat to E and N is guard squeezed - only if declarer would have unblocked the @s8 earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2@d = raise in @c |pg||

nt|kfay: Likely he was looking for a good slam.|pg||
nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: although he might have checked out with 4@h once partner shows a min|pg||
nt|fluffy: passive leads would make 4@h a make, but there are no apssive leads on this hand, and whatever lead but a trump if continued ends up beating 4@h|pg||
nt|kfay: I don't think it's really emphasized enough that this 2@H bid really shows a very nice hand opposite Fisher's pass.  I've seen a lot of 2@Hs thrown out just because opener is 5-4 ...|pg||
nt|kfay: and that is not a good way to play.  You'll get a lot of punishment.  That's why Fisher's thinking here because I'm sure he knows his partner is reliable.|pg||
nt|phil: especially when partner is already prone to respond light|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kfay: This is another good example of how the 4-4 plays better than the 5-3 since a losing @d can be pitched on the long spades.|pg||

nt|ritong: hello curtis|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2nd half of the Quarter finals is playe tomorrow at 10.00 am here in Veldhoved -- guess its 4.00am in New York|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board, Parimatch will continue to the semi finals of the transnationals.|pg||
nt|yuval10: entering the last board of the first haw, Israel holds a slim lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board of this Semi-Final, the final should start at 18.20 local time, thats 35 min from now, I believe we are a bit late on shedule..|pg||
mb|1N|nt|migry: indeed|pg||
nt|kfay: In that case maybe he should have played the J also.|pg||
nt|fluffy: padon made 4@h on the other table the match is very close|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: David Berkowits and Alan Sontag are due up for the Gordon team.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Robert Stephens who like all the operators did an excellent job|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzpf: remind all of you, Israel has 7 imp less!|pg||
nt|kfay: But clearly it's at least somewhat undiscussed so I'm not sure why he'd expect all of this.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|migry: will it be a @s partscore or a @d one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: DBL is a transfer to 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|yuval10: can the Israeli team hold up and "kill" yet another giant? we'll know right away. i believe the 2nd half was due to start 15:40 local time|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: when will be my lunch break then? (and the players')|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: I don't think the 'error' was really either E's or W's fault.  You kind of win those battles in the off season more than at the table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: to the WBF for letting BBO broadcast these events, to the spectator, and to my co-commentators (hey thats me)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|vugraphzpf: and DBL = "Clarify" partner|pg||
nt|mrt2000: as predicited   :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can ask Bas to bring you some Marc :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrt2000: predicted|pg||
nt|migry: :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: another israel juniors had this same sequence yesterday|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fluffy: the 3@h bidder had @hAK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|yuval10: thanks very much for our operator Marc for a splendid job, also to Migry who joined me over this broadcasting|pg||
nt|fluffy: and they played a silly 5@h with @hAK opposite 9xxxx|pg||
nt|fluffy: now they all know 3@h doesn't show real support I guess|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kfay: This hand kind of brings up an interesting topic for me and that's what S should do if his hand were AKQx Kxx Qx xxxx|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fluffy: this lead will lead to -460 quickly|pg||
nt|kfay: Well I guess since 1@H could be 4 maybe this is a poor example.|pg||
nt|kfay: But say it guaranteed 5 I believe it's best to bid 2@C in response to 1@H with that shape (4324 and a game force) simply to have a more efficient auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe the final 32 boards of this event start at 10:00 tomorrow local time, can you confirm that Robert|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: looks like 10:30, so as to run alongside the other 3 events. They def start at 10:30|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzpf: Bas is off today|pg||
pc|s9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: ok that is 1:30 am Vancouver time, 4:30 New York|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yuval10: he could've played @c and make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: most welcome, I might be back next session|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kfay: If you bid 1@s and partner bids 2@d you have the nightmare scenario of having to force with 3@C and hoping you can agree hearts (unambiguously) by the 3-level.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kfay: It's a lot easier just to bid 2@c and be assured you can get your hearts in cheaply later.|pg||
nt|kfay: If partner has 4 spades, he'll bid them anyway and you can still get to your 4-4.|pg||
nt|kfay: OK, exciting match.  Remember that Gordon currently has a 7-IMP lead.|pg||
nt|kfay: Good afternoon.|pg||
nt|kfay: See you, Gonzo.  Thanks.|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx all|pg||
nt|kfay: Thanks to our excellent operator, Gerbrand!|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx kevin and gerbrand|pg||
nt|fluffy: going ot hte other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: leaving this table open, incase other table crashes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have Fisher and Schwartz behind me now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher is getting crazy a bit|pg||
