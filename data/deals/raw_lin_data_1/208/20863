mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|an|5+ (?)|nt|mrt2000: wonder if they'll get to 6@S?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: lets see how they instate slam platform|pg||
nt|yuval10: E discarded 6@d and 4@d over the first 2 @c's, i'd say he showed interest in @s|pg||
nt|migry: usually 5+|pg||
mb|2H|nt|migry: i assume they have the methods|pg||
nt|ritong: possible, yes:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: knowing these two, it's more or less a certainty!|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: oh yes  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: the question is how good the slam really is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@D = @s raise - slam invitational|pg||
nt|mrt2000: unless they get to &, that is|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@h asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 4@c = @d shortness|pg||
nt|migry: with the spades 4-1 declarer has some work to do here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 'mildly invitational with not good spades' is now wat R'berg says loudly|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrt2000: still a make though, I think|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mrt2000: although a @S lead from N would be tricky|pg||
nt|migry: was wondering what would be "normal play" on a @c lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|migry: sry - on a @h lead|pg||
nt|migry: spade is tricky|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to ruff twice on the same side to come up to 12, at first sight|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h+2@c+1@d implies 6 @s tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|migry: and work on the hearts- probably hearts 3-3 will make it easy|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzpf: 5@h asks for Kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@s says -- Sorry partner - I have none|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|migry: 5@d would have asked for the Q@S|pg||
nt|migry: and the second step confirms all key cards|pg||
nt|mrt2000: he found it|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to lose the lead in @hs no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a second round of trumps would be clumsy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he certainly plans to lead a @h towards QJ asap  the question is, does the timing demand a ruff before that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sorry -- says Rodwell -- and put his cards on the table |pg||
nt|migry: easiest would be to try and ruff 2 clubs in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  achesslike hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: an other solution can be @h hook then Xruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N's 7@S could grow up quickly here|pg||
nt|migry: can't make it now as he will have to give a @h and that little @s7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrt2000: strange play from dummy at trick 1|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but i would think twice before questioning a rodwell's play:)|pg||
nt|migry: agreed|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it does not consist in second play low|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I wasn't questioning, just onserving  :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: observing|pg||
nt|ritong: i think his play simplified matters with @s9 in north|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|migry: doesn't look like there were communication problems so not sure why the 8@s was relevant at that point|pg||
nt|ritong: in case of Xruff plan|pg||
nt|mrt2000: agrred, ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and for those of you thinking about an operator error -- forget it -- not this time :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|migry: the point is that while the 8@s was the "wrong" play here, I'm sure that Rodwell had a very good idea about why he's playing it|pg||

nt|ritong: a @d lead might help|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT probably @d's|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: 3@H = 5card@H|pg||
mb|2D!|an|3/4 !D|nt|yuval10: so now they might play the @d contract from the right side after all|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|yuval10: where the @s's are defended|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: although here, north is known a priori with 2@h and at most 3@s|pg||
nt|ritong: which considerably reduces the chance to have the five first @ds to be cashable|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal to win in dummy and start on hearts|pg||
nt|mrt2000: so, is a @S lead not indicates?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indicated|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so, but maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: pard is supposed to hold at least 4, right|pg||
nt|migry: i thought europeans like to lead 3 card suits in these sequences, don't they Henri?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ritong: on the other hand, better lead your own suits than the inferred ones with pard, most of the time|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|yuval10: yet still, a @c lead and a @s switch looks tricky , if you play 6@d. you have to ruff 2 @h's and you have no entry for the K@c in dummy|pg||

nt|yuval10: E would probably have loved to ask RKCB right away , but was affraid that 4NT over 3@d would be quantitive, as EW didn't agreed on a suit yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: the director was called (again) and not sure what's happenin to that board |pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor the 3@s bid was good in removing all doubts|pg||

pc|sK|nt|yuval10: not even a 3@s bid by South in the OR stopped EW from bidding slam, when West found a 4@d bid|pg||
mc|13|nt|migry: so for now board  7 was skipped and they r playing  8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 7 scored as a pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: looks like they are playing board  7 now in the other room so ignore the result|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c = @s-suit AND either @h or @c|pg||
nt|migry: either show spade shortness or clubs|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mrt2000: in fact, I suspect it takes a @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|migry: 4nt now?|pg||

nt|mrt2000: why would N remove the X?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||

nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||

pc|c7|pc|s3|nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
