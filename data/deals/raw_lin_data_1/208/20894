nt|danilo1: got few question why no commentary in Italian ... as far as I remember, usually, Italian champhionships are for serie Nationale, A (maybe also B) at the same time ... so all ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: possible comentators (italians) are playing :)|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|djneill:  East doubles to show 4+@s (1@s would deny @s)|pg||
nt|djneill:  of course|pg||
nt|danilo1: most of my (serious) bridge careet, I played in Italy :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok North chose to reopen with 2@s rather than double|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  the major suits are indeed quality|pg||
mb|3D|nt|danilo1: 2@S by North is kind of ... Mixed events bridge|pg||
mb|d|nt|djneill:  I hesitate to bid 2@s though since South chose not to bid 1@s (or anything for that matter) over X|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this trump suit is quite interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if you know east has the ace, the percentage play is small to king, then duck on|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok North doubles the third time and thankfully South likes this|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: duck one|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|athene: that gains against @HAx and @HAxx with east, and loses only to @HAJx|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|djneill:  here, count is most important (how many spades will cash), so South will play a low @s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|athene: of course it would have been harder after a club lead then three rounds of spades, with west threatening to overruff dummy :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|athene: i guess east was going for singleton spade with partner but that was a bit of a long shot i think|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 11s dble promissed @S .. someting is wrong with EW system ... why should notEast be able to Dble for penalty - and if so agreed, why than West does not Dble instead of 3@D ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: (already promissed 6-cards) bidding 2@D free|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d4|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so West should probably cash the @dA here because North has at most 1 diamond, it might be the King, but West may think South has all the diamonds, in which case, not cashing the dA is better so as to have the end position better|pg||
nt|djneill:  but for sure, West cannot pick up all the diamonds, North will not have a doubleton on this auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 6@C makes here i suppose with the @CQ appearing, as you can set up the diamonds for a spade pitch|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: if east decides to lead passively, say a diamond, i suppose you might just cash the @HAK intending to try to set up spades for a club pitch|pg||
nt|danilo1: in Fiori Roano, 2@C was three-suiter .. thk we need some basis for NS system|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|djneill:  bleeding 4 rounds of trumps, is just 8 tricks, besides the transportation problems so I think South will ruff some tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|djneill:  assuming it is a 3-suiter, a trump lead would have been more normal|pg||
nt|danilo1: however, I find North's 3@C bid too bold, even if he can project single @S at pd|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes he knows it will be rough play, 3suiters don't play too well|pg||
nt|djneill:  and South will reopen with a double surely if short in @s|pg||
