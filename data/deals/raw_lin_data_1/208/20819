nt|lechcold: 5@C wychodzi na doæ extremalnym manewrze Guillemarda:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: singiel atu przy dwóch pikach - to jest ta dodatkowa szansa|pg||
nt|meargent: 2@Ds was an inverted raise showing invitational or better vaues|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: wywo³awcza na trefle - ma po 3 co najmniej w pozosta³ych kolorach to kontruje|pg||
nt|famus: now comes the whack if US acts further:)|pg||
nt|famus: push i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rare to see 1@C as 2+ but NOT transfer responses|pg||
nt|pawel90: na drugim stole Krzy - "tata" rozgrywa 5@c po kontrze na trefla - chyba dwukolorowej|pg||
nt|lechcold: da radê|pg||
nt|garden2005: ale wtedy i tak to jest najlepsza rozgrywka (na manewr G), rozgrywaj¹cy nie ma wyboru|pg||
nt|westjava: sure, they do it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: note N orths pass- I am sure that most will venture 3H but this is not Israeli style|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best lead|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
pc|c4|nt|famus: next|pg||
nt|josj: well, 3nt is definitely easier, with the @D behaving...|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed in better spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|meargent: 2@Hs is conventional|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 2@d was written on paper: limit raise, 4+|pg||
nt|meargent: 3@Ds shows limit raise|pg||
nt|timb: I',m not a fan of that 1NT opening; it fails to meet the "balanced" requirement of most people's idea of a 1NT opening|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pawel90: rozgrywa lepiej ni¿ wistuje :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me look againg,  what do you think George|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: head on the table....thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i do not think she has higher ambitions than 5d|pg||
nt|odysseus69: is it possible that South has jxx - North does not want to provide entry to dummy so withhods Q righly|pg||
nt|odysseus69: small diamond to 9 is the deep finesse play|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||

nt|sharkey: Will make - but Indonesia may pick up a couple of IMPs in @H contract|pg||
nt|orentol: yea.. and might know they may miss major fit.|pg||
nt|dburn:  South may find the club ruff hard to believe, of course|pg||
nt|dburn:  and North ought to play the queen of hearts now, not the ace|pg||

nt|odysseus69: discarding is giving up|pg||
nt|eamongall: I would think that 2@S is rebid is on the low side given its precision but then 1@S only promises 3 card @Ss .. I better look for some convention cards |pg||

nt|vugraphznz: Hi David|pg||
nt|timb: Perhaps EW are followers of Sally Brock's "Easy Guide to Five-Card Majors"; there she advocates opening 1NT on 4441s when in the 15-17 point range. |pg||

nt|sharkey: Nice switch from N|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|starkist: natural way to guess the @d's at least|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: S has it difficult|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: EW big club  and many bids value "zz" points  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]  lots of relays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  fairly vanilla 2/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: imps are converted to VPs [victory points]|pg||
nt|dburn:  since if she leads ace and another, South may try for a heart ruff and not a club ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: so England are in the game with a chance - but the problem is declarer cant get to dummy to take the finesse in @S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: and top 8 teams advance to Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|westjava: freak distribution, interesting play here|pg||
nt|blewah: @d or @h from hand is reasonable|pg||
nt|westjava: other room, Gaviard (S) not to overcall after 1@S|pg||
nt|copeyj: so i think it is down 1 regardless|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed - no real way to do that|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the defenders slightly fortunate that declarer's spades aren't solid|pg||
nt|dburn:  Rimstedt quite right to overtake the queen of hearts - North should have @hAQ doubleton to defend like that|pg||
nt|timb: It was good play to take @HA; otherwise declarer could have scrambled home|pg||
nt|timb: Interestingly at double dummy, the contract was lost at trick one; declarer had to play the @S10 or @SJ at trick one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|meargent: 6@Ds being played by italians in OR|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if the @d suit comes in in 4@h, so a normal contract turns into a good save|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: USA not X'd in the other room|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: if you are bidding confidently enough, you have a good chance to push non-vulnerable opponents a bit higher |pg||
nt|yuval10: it's likely that @c's are 2-2 because both defenders were in their hand once and didn't play @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps the only possible case in which it won't apply is when South has A@c singelton, and that's what makes W thinks|pg||
nt|yuval10: if South has the A@c, and he wins and play @d, then declarer has to guess, which of course is not optimal|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps declarer could have done better if he had assured an entry to dummy  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Barel now sighing and puffing|pg||
nt|alnanda: goedemiddag netherland.. :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: players that fail to qualify will probably play the Transnational Teams but maybe in different partnerships/teams|pg||
nt|blewah: but need a low @c from the table|pg||
nt|blewah: with 54 M she didn't consider it as balance|pg||
nt|westjava: yes she will, 2 entry on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: have to restart again, sry|pg||
nt|orentol: yea reasonable after J @s won and 9 @c ;)|pg||
nt|sharkey: West started the double finesse in @H - shud continue now and not top the suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ryskiel_: no 10 i zawsze sz³o|pg||

nt|blewah: difficult hand. could be made though I think of @c was low from the table|pg||
nt|sharkey: At IMPs she wanted to make sure of the contract - thus she played @HA|pg||
nt|copeyj: so down 1 here, and maybe a couple of imps to England|pg||

nt|meargent: we arent proud a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|chmitty: le dernier de la journée|pg||
nt|kit: 2@D shows 4 spades, 5 diamonds, 5-11.  Guess he had a heart in his diamonds :)|pg||
nt|kit: actually, he can be 4-4|pg||
nt|kit: This gives Martel a problem.  Normally he would be looking to play in spades, but he knows that isn't a good idea.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Walddk4: Operator, do you read me?|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: 4h has to be a strong bid at these colors|pg||
nt|garden2005: Kibice*|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: NS also have a good save in 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: the 6d bid probably give you confidence to underleaed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2S now usually balanced with 4S - Wow that was surprise|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think he was taking advance sacrifice but North may expect a lot more- but the colours may be a clue|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This is plain silly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not in this match  -- identical auctions both tables|pg||
nt|joanem: no support X i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Meyers alerted|pg||
nt|joanem: denies 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL gets the nod because 4@H and only doubleton @S   @SAxx and 4@H  would probably bid 3N since able to duck @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both lead @SQ  but would be interesting to examine play after @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting if done by someone else:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller could bid 2@C to show loing @D -- but needed [at least] another King |pg||

nt|josj: over 5@D, W could no longer make the 5@C fitbid to solve East's problems...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably win here to prevent @C shift  or early @H guess but duck seems to have merit too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I assumed 4S from South|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sorry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the 4S bid was so ncharacteristic that I almost fell off my chair|pg||
nt|kit: The Stayman call works well when West has 4 hearts, but if not they will be overboard.  And even when West has 4 hearts, 4@H might not be a bargain.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: now we are 2|pg||
nt|kit: The spade lead, while normal, is quite helpful to declarer as spades is his source of tricks.|pg||
nt|kit: Madala's best chance is to duck -- but his partner might have a singleton spade and a top heart honor in which case it is necessary to play the jack.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|meargent: @HQ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: tough hand to lead from for Smith|pg||
nt|copeyj: but this is a very ambitious game, which should go down with 3@S and 1@D to lose, but stranger things have happened|pg||

nt|chmitty: à 3SA on ne peut pas à la fois affranchir les @c et encaisser les @d, faute de communication|pg||
nt|dburn:  good lead, but West has to put in the nine to make sure of an entry - that is, unless declarer puts in the jack to kill it|pg||
nt|april7: S was looking for a 4-4 fit in @S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|timb: I prefer 2@S instead if 1NT by South; Australia's top masterpoint winner Bob Richman believes that "more points are lost by not supporting partner on 3-cards that any other action:|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: would love to finesse in @D [trusting @DJ to be honest]  but transportation is bad without peeking for location of @HA|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4NT will make probably 11 tricks so lets put on the kettle |pg||
nt|sharkey: As predicted Indonesia ended up in the superior @H contract and picked up 2 IMPs|pg||

nt|panosk: Hi Aramesh thx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: the hand is much easier seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is the downside of using double dummy software like GIB or Deep Finesse|pg||

nt|copeyj: Brock can not get in|pg||
nt|dburn:  better play a diamond now, but I am sure she will do that|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: because 2S usually shows balanced weak hand with 4 spades South was not comfortable with that-- he  decided to blast 4S in the hope that partner had less and that oppo could make ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H - dont think he will do that again|pg||

pc|d9|nt|fokal: hi |pg||
nt|mamos: The defence has rached a critical point - East needs to get this right to defeat the contract |pg||
nt|kit: Now he needs to ruff 2 diamonds in dummy to geet up to 10 tricks |pg||
pc|d7|nt|timb: If Neve knew West had four diamonds then it would be best to play East for a doubleton honor; luckily she doesn't have that information|pg||
nt|timb: I like a low diamond more than @D10|pg||
nt|timb: Now she has to guess whether West has @DKQ|pg||

nt|eamongall: some red suit work required to bring home 4@S here if they bid it |pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: i believe the other dutch pairs play Raptor NT overcalls  so North will bid 1N to show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||

nt|reisig: Not the toughest hand to play |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H or pass?|pg||

nt|blewah: yes, must be weak|pg||
nt|panosk: 1NT not forcing?|pg||
nt|panosk: confirmed and handy in this hand :)|pg||
nt|panosk: to open 1@H with W hand like in open room i think is very streched, much prefer pass too|pg||
mb|p|nt|joanem:  better to show your 4 card suit and play the 5/2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: coffee hand ?|pg||

nt|petergill: The play might be interesting if they reach 3NT|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: previous board, @h 6|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: was the lead|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes, standard and weak NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|lechcold: w 18 sorry:(|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: loose 1h,1d and 1c...|pg||
nt|fokal: and not start with @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: yes true|pg||
nt|fokal: tough board|pg||
nt|josj: hi Olivier, welcome to join into the commentary :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: my bet is on Willard... she will make this|pg||
nt|josj: I tend to agree...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the minor suit 10s and the weak hearts suggest a pass of 1NT|pg||
nt|joanem: now they will have a bad time in the 43 breaking 42 |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this can be a swing board|pg||
nt|meargent: and it aint 4th best|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N is not sure|pg||
nt|meargent: well i am|pg||
nt|ritong: peut être ont elles une réponse pour les deux majeures|pg||

nt|eamongall: so declarer should be ok .. |pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see 3 NT makes - opportunity for the Americans next door|pg||
nt|sharkey: Vul games shud be bid if the chance of success is 37% according to the math gurus - this hand may fit in|pg||
nt|panosk: 4 inscepable losers in N hand shud be a push|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW will try 4@S which looks OK with @S onside|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: Lall's fit showing jump shut out the @S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here GeO remains silent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also 3N east  after 1@S open with Fredin passing 1st round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HT falling means 2nd stopper in the suit -- and natural attack of @C kills entry to long @H|pg||
nt|joanem: 2s much easier |pg||
nt|joanem: and jill lead |pg||
nt|odysseus69: but 2S also down|pg||
nt|ritong: et dans ce cas levin aurait opté pour 4@s, sûre d un doubleton en face|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D denies 3 hearts (else Support Dbl), hence alert (I think)|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Barbara and everyone|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: yes 2@D denied a 3 card @H|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Vincent|pg||
nt|odysseus69: assume he has shown heart shortage so West has nothing wasted although only 12 points|pg||
nt|april7: should W has opened 2 NT for the minors, its too weak though, if they even play that convention, then its easier|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: only need to find the killing defense|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am told it is not difficult - but i would also say it is not difficult to bid something with GeO's hand - and he didnt:)|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi Barbara-wlc:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not so good if West had 642 of spades and J1065 of hearts- the toy worked but I am not convinced|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: de nos jours, on dit 1SA 3SA dans les deux salles et on laisse les défenseurs se débrouiller|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is easy , but 3NT on a @h lead looks hard-to-analyse - should make 3NT maybe?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|edou2704:  3@d is making so 3@h should be a good save if north can find the right @c play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: ah the defence can get a Diamond ruff now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphznz: nice start|pg||
nt|josj: first hurdle surmounted|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: this looks safer   though a club is a little worry|pg||
nt|ady: if North plays the ace and draws last trump   and plays a spade  and plays the 9  and east has the queden  then a 2nd club would defeat the contract|pg||
nt|starkist: say it pepe|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: now they made up some time, easy board|pg||
nt|panosk: your comments are welcome as always|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: Inm 3NT - win @HA then spade to nine or ace - develop a 9th trick in spades while @DA is in dummy as access to long spade|pg||

nt|ritong: plusieurs options pour joanna|pg||
nt|ritong: contre, 3@s, 3@c|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s serait un peu forcé|pg||

nt|chmitty: et on laisse jouer 4@s du coup|pg||
nt|ritong: c est ballot|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT - prev board - running off all the @D's looks best then --- W keeps Jxx, Qx void, Jx and has one discard to make, but discards after S who has a problem|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: dziekuje za zwrocenie uwagi|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4S cheap|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cheap save against slam- at vulnerability maybe West should join in over 1D|pg||

nt|grebrof: some think that their opps read their conventioncard and often try to "fool" the opponents - not a good idea, cause you will most times only fool your partner|pg||

nt|ahollan1: deWijs could show same shape with stronger hand by bidding above 3N|pg||

nt|odysseus69: has something gone wrong?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin looks puzzled by the 4d bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 5d bid sorry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks as if North showed 1 key card by mistake|pg||
nt|joanem: cue of hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if 4C was key card North may reaiise she gave wrong response and bid 6C now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin stil thinking|pg||
nt|joanem: levin very worried about spades as no cue there?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no sac |pg||
nt|chmitty: Espérons que Levin entame @c pour nous laisser une chance|pg||
nt|chmitty: mais je n'y crois pas|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 4 in 3NT - S can keep K10x, KJ, void, Ax, so perhaps randomly trying to guess @C10 early is the best way to go |pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: thanks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it also allows NS to get into the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here  Muller doesn't have any help from NS  so has to guess @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: Palmer may play ace of hts and a ht,   to hold down ruffs?|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: both sides of the screen discussing the 4c bid lol|pg||
nt|starkist: 6 on a guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: 2D seems to have worked - North didnt have enough for 2H but maybe after 3C -p-p 3H is possible|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@h was possible as dealer|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|petergill: Welcome to Wayne Stuart|pg||
nt|barbyh: a nice surprise when the heart king is onside|pg||
nt|meargent: 6@Ds is quite a good contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm asked what écarry over" means : it means that at the start of this match, there is already a small dscore, coming from the results between both teams|pg||
nt|chmitty: when they met in the eliminatories|pg||
nt|chmitty: "carry over" sry|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud N have raised after pd willing to play 1 NT xx?|pg||
nt|april7: S shoukld stay small, I doubt if W will continue with ace of @C|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like 6 @s |pg||
pc|h9|nt|drorp: not easy decision for Amaral, and he gives a lot of credit to the vul overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: hate 5@c there - seems better to bid 4@c the previous round  Job done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer will probably try to find @S10 doubleton somewhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real way to force defense to break @S or @D   [frozen suits]|pg||
nt|meargent: not such a good line if @Ss ly badly|pg||
nt|meargent: should play @S NOW|pg||
nt|sybarra: but it ace of sp with W,  now would have to deal with @D ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: and a club loser   |pg||
nt|sybarra: that was but if, spade ace|pg||
nt|meargent: she is probably DOOMED then in any case|pg||
nt|meargent: if east has 3@Hs |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N asking about signals|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: shaking her head now|pg||
nt|meargent: in OR north bid a direct 4@Hs over 3@Ss and US got to 8@Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and S is reading the bulletin|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess the ace of sp has to be with E, given the opening |pg||
nt|meargent: ace and @H will work but i dont thinck its best|pg||
nt|chmitty: on peut gagner à cartes ouvertes je crois|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  upside-down count & attitude  Smith vs NT  [but won't apply here]|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lechcold: tu te¿ jest szansa na punkty... w kiery na WE mo¿na sporo ugraæ|pg||
nt|ritong: c est en tout cas ce que dit GiB|pg||
nt|starkist: virtually cold on non@h lead|pg||
nt|meargent: but 5@Ds is better than 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: netherlands open went 1 down in 6@d|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|josj: best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live results under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|joanem: i think jill L thought that 5d was cue agreeing clubs denying 1st or 2nd round control of spades - so passed 5d|pg||
nt|lechcold: Murniatinie zaryzykowa³a wejcia 1@D,ciekawe...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a ile Lechu?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|drorp: double dummy this contract makes, double finessing the JT of hearts, and chagas might actually make it if he can place Gino with the A@C from the quick double on 5@C|pg||
nt|grebrof: Israel is unbeaten so far - 16, 25 and 15, while Brasil have scored 18, 14 and 20 |pg||
nt|drorp: sorry 1 off double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: south passed twice|pg||
nt|meargent: but then again i am a lousy declarer|pg||
nt|starkist: 1n opening with east hand other table , you approve pepe?|pg||
nt|meargent: not really|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fokal: probably counting on 3 @h tricks with the finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: na drugim stole 2N i wist kierowy. Jest szansa na pierwsze punkty|pg||
nt|april7: but still not 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|april7: because of trumps 3-1|pg||
nt|panosk: needs to be carefull but i they she will make |pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: the @C shift|pg||
nt|blewah: 9 now|pg||
nt|westjava: you see, how lady find a lady...|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: welcome back all |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: play was very slow until now, so we did not miss many boards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it is a recurring event- players give wrong response to keycard - dont know why |pg||
nt|lechcold: to zale¿y od wistu i rozgrywki:) po walecie karo na przyk³ad to hoho...|pg||
nt|blewah: it's women's business|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: good|pg||
nt|xenya: so 11 tricks coming|pg||
nt|drorp: 5@C is a big gamble that they make 4@S when u have 2 sure defensive tricks, unless he actually thought he can make 5@C|pg||
nt|starkist: @d's too meaty and prime|pg||
nt|meargent: too good for weak nt |pg||
nt|starkist: that too|pg||
nt|panosk: * i think she will make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: that also lets you see result from ALL tables of any given hand|pg||
nt|ritong: ça joue toujours|pg||
pc|dK|nt|westjava: I always wrong|pg||
nt|copeyj: This is a pretty good game - wonder if Dhondy-Senior have some methods to get to it next door|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: so good ducking and good covering from East|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: now she will be home|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: for another tie hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H virtually laydown but somehow both rooms cant get there- difficult- both North and South dislike their diamond holding but  it is a perfect marriage|pg||
nt|eamongall: I see about 5 more tricks for NS|pg||
nt|eamongall: thats 7 in total and 3 down ... and 200  from their team mates |pg||
nt|sharkey: Is this the first time the Indonesian Ladies Team have advanced this far in Benice Cup Hendra?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: safe to take @C finesse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: it seems a bit umnlikely to make after Pass by dealer|pg||
nt|fokal: she will still make 3 @h tricks, but not for that reason :)|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|westjava: how about lady of diamond, let's see|pg||
nt|starkist: I only like my steak meaty and prime|pg||
nt|meargent: good enough for strong nt but it does seem to me a bit of a shot|pg||
nt|edou2704:  the result from round robin is partially keeped|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: another gain for NZ - should be 6 imps|pg||
nt|meargent: and beth palmer is a world champion|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are not exactly a slouch Mr.. Silver |pg||
nt|meargent: not as a declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well just arrange the auction so that pard plays all the tough hands |pg||
nt|meargent: thats always my hope|pg||
nt|sharkey: *Venice|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chmitty: il aurait fallu jouer @h et @h en défaussant son @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: mais c'est jouer spécifiquement les atouts 41 et les @h 22|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna joue simplement pour l as de @s placé et les atouts ronds|pg||
nt|ritong: maintenant, si levin ne prend pas, elle aura des éléments de table|pg||
nt|chmitty: Levin va prendre et jouer @d c'est certain|pg||
nt|ritong: et de toute façon, si levin ducke, c est fini|pg||
nt|ritong: et elle le sait|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes....before only rank 9 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: impressive feat|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: Lindop led @S so that gave declarer  10|pg||
nt|lokaty: na pewno dziwi brak wejcia 1@D po treflu, pewnie maj¹ jak¹ konwencjê|pg||
nt|edou2704:  if winning team from this match finished before the other, they have a 50% carry over|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphznz: back in the tank now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: she closed the screen asking about the count|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right Rich- I failed to spot the pass|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 66 teams all playing same board  makes for great comparisons|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if south doesn't have the @sJ he might now underlead the Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CJ to show more points and maybe get Muller to place @SA in north??|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: in fear of giving 2 discards on @c if declarer had @c KQT|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d a indiqué un fit franc, trois cartes a @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: on ne peut plus que défausser pour ne chuter que d'une|pg||
nt|chmitty: double mauvais coup Français : le par était à 6@d contrés deux de chute|pg||
nt|ritong: joanna a du mal a se résoudre à chuter|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: of course N threw a small @S on the first trick, sorry|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: unless declarer gors fot ultra safety -- which he did|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@H is a sensible spot to be - you don't want to be in 6@H on a finesse when 650/680 might pick up imps if 500 or 300 happens at other table|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: mais..|pg||
nt|edou2704:  if they lost, there is a 33% carry over|pg||
nt|panosk: even with heart lead you take @HA cash A@C play spade to hane throw @H on K@C and try to establis @D|pg||
pc|s7|nt|grebrof: the 4th match (the internetsite is finally up again), Israel scored 22 and Brasil 25, so both these teams have started off very well|pg||
nt|drorp: heading towards 2 off now, had to play a heart, now he won't have 2 entries anymore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cullin just convincing himself that nothing can go wrong with @D play|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: should have gone with gut|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this still works when Upmark exits @DA|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Italy gains 10 IMPS back with avoiding a chanceless 3NT|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|blewah: safer route for overtrick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: then 2H OK over 2D too|pg||
nt|panosk: *spade to hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: rightly perhaps|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: now forced to play Nabil for @SJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the longer he thinks, the more convinced Muller will be|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|westjava: yup|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thanks.  Declarer will still make overtrick(s)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 4S as a save against 4H will happen esewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they are discusssin now the 4c bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this will be the only table where N/S dont bid a slam|pg||
nt|joanem: a simple 3d over 3c would be forcing hopefully   |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e trochê optymizmu - popatrzmy na stronê ekonomiczn¹ s³abej gry...bêdzie plusowa,, choæ dok³adniej mniej minusowa|pg||
nt|alunand14: 1st score for INA|pg||
nt|ritong: espérons que danièle ne va pas râler|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lost opportunity previous board for Indonesia - cud have bid game|pg||
nt|panosk: conservative approaches, by both S and W|pg||
nt|panosk: tough luck for France|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit would preempt here   what about Chip Martel?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lechcold: tu nasi graj¹ 5@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@H sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil held too many @S to duck the Q    i think|pg||
nt|mamos: so a quietish start to the match with a few overtricks and a small partscore swing|pg||
nt|ritong: enfin, pas tout de suite|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lot of biddable suits here|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never should have doubted|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@S + @C/@D|pg||
nt|starkist: that would cheer up e/w if they were to guess 3n had happened other room|pg||
nt|eamongall: but 700 in total  is 12 imps to England |pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play 4@S as STRONG hand  [don't preempt over preempt]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 4 pik? a mo¿e co innego od Piotra?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Leaping Michaels   4@D=@D and @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H from North now standard |pg||
nt|sybarra: and an easy 3 nt here ++2|pg||
nt|meargent: the trick here is to avoid slam|pg||
nt|westjava: 10 or 11 tricks, aria?|pg||
nt|westjava: or to Felipe?|pg||
nt|blewah: i think it was 11|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will north join in?|pg||
nt|panosk: for us neutrals a tighter match means more excitement|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like 2@D = michaels = both majors|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I'm quite surprised about this call|pg||
nt|kit: If Bocchi is thinking, he may be surprised about Madala's hand also|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: IF you agree to play the convention with your partner -- make sure you know if 4minor bid is forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller has a good hand now with 2 aces, 4 trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: though he would prefer to have more high card points in the red suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in the other room  elAhmady running trump interesting squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and LOTS of pressure on defenders to discard properly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump to 6@D very reasonable here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know if there is any scientific way to investigate staying lower or getting higher|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: but with the hearts the way they are, even 5@d is a difficult contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4333 in N, not source of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think I remember n/s can open some wild nt bids |pg||
nt|panosk: 4th seat oppenings are guided by the rule of 15 , ot for some rule of 14, that is if the total of cards spades and points is 15 you open |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|meargent: hopefully for NS they wont find their @D fit|pg||
nt|chmitty: c'était très dur de passer 5@h pour Joanna : en disant 5@h Sud indique seulement son envie de jouer au palier de 5|pg||
nt|ritong: l alerte de 2@h passe signifie que passe dénie 3 @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: ok, ty Felipe|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Felipe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: majors I suspect|pg||
nt|panosk: i prefer 15 some prefer 14 depends on your style|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@D = Spade fit + Diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i saw notes for one pair that use  4@H/@S to differentiate hand types  for this exact problem|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: partscore board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but if 4C was keycard then ideal- provided North knows about it|pg||
nt|garden2005: spójrzcie na flagi, Indonezyjki wygl¹daj¹ jak lewe Polki :) nadstawi¹ siê zaraz|pg||
nt|petergill: Back on Bd 4 in 3NT - in the 6 card ending, S has to pitch something - @HJ looks like the only chance, now declarer exits in @C and the defence is awkwardly placed. Sp perhaps no ...|pg||
nt|petergill: need to guess @C10 in 3NT on Bd 4|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT weak |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|eamongall: this is precision 1@S so limited |pg||
nt|timb: NS have put up a good barrage|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ryskiel_: 5 @s pewnie powie|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to mo¿e wgoniæ w szlemika i wtedy trzeba broniæ|pg||
nt|drorp: other table bidding started with north opening and then rebidding clubs, so this result might be duplicated, but i didn't see how the bidding ended|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S=slam interest @H  and 5@C=slam interest @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double pprobably was 4 or more spades where 1S would deny 4|pg||
nt|lechcold: eee co Ty, bilety powrotne i tak maj¹ pewnie zarezerwowane na 30-go|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT  F1|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes, this team has prepared a year ago in preparation for Sea Games on Nopember...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like NS will not find their 9 card @S fit....|pg||
nt|copeyj: Sweden are in 3@D on b21 I am told|pg||
nt|copeyj: so that will be a few imps back to them|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@S i prefer from S here asking for stopper with strong hand |pg||
pc|d9|nt|kiwibridge: 14-17 and aggressive jump by Ware|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-4 zz  could have game force strength    [zz  A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=a) 16-19 HCP, 5+@H  b) any 20+ HCP|pg||
nt|panosk: the French ladies need to compose themshelves fast so as to avoid paying this hand more than they already did|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 50-ka albo 100-ka w zale¿nosci od prze³yku|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone (specs) would prefer to have Q of @C be q of @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: then we might be looking at a decent slam|pg||
nt|chmitty: encore 5imps qui vont partir|pg||
nt|ritong: car, avec trois @ss on contrerait " de soutien"|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S longer spades than hearts - else Mike Ware bids 2@D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2N T-minors |pg||
nt|timb: Well done by Simons, taking the pressure of partner|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: S thinking about 7@D...|pg||
nt|timb: This auction makes it harder for South to bid 7@D; it sounds like a guess|pg||
nt|april7: after this bidding only a partscore in @C is best|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ryskiel_: sorry na 5 to albo polska 100-ka albo rosyjskie SPGie|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Jacek cos mowi pod nosem, ze chyba mogl spasowac|pg||
nt|grebrof: as I see there are others that are more updated than me - the 5th match has suddenly appeared on the site :D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my notes stop here :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: South asked about 3@S, West: let me think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe EW play the same 1@C structure as Bertheau-Nystrom  but  i don't have those 4th bids either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from one who KNOWS     3@S=it shows 3-4 zz, 5+H, 4S, void in C|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: is what west explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reliable source confirms my guess about 4@S/5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice stop!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump lead makes sense but probably @SK|pg||
nt|westjava: fast bid to 4@S|pg||
nt|chmitty: another chance for a small swing to France|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs asking about 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if it's exactly 5@s an 4+ in a minor. South confirming this|pg||
nt|barbyh: prob shows a nf distributional hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|meargent: from my point of view this is more than decent if NS bid it|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 sp squeaks home|pg||
nt|panosk: they wud have ended in 5@C also since no stopper|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess 4@D showed a strong 4M bid (or something more specific)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphznz: 4h did not make at the other table....so another big chunk of imps for france|pg||
nt|josj: they were in 2nt...:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: loool... i see now|pg||
nt|lokaty: treflowy tylko k³ad³ chyba|pg||
nt|lokaty: 3@S da³ Burek, bo graj¹ 1 NT 14-16|pg||
nt|joanem: but having an 8 card beautiful diamond suit is sad to be raising clubs on 3 small  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this link seems to work: http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-venice-cup|pg||
nt|mamos: not much to be said about this either|pg||
nt|petergill: Geo Tislevoll moved from Norway to Auckland New Zealand when he married Faith Mayer who lives in NZ but she sometimes play s bridge for her country of origin Philippines|pg||
nt|chmitty: not so easy to grab 9 tricks anyhow|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C=relay   4@S=3zz  4630|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many still play that 1S promises 5 and double is no more than 4 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly this pair is not afraid to bid 'em |pg||
nt|meargent: EW will have to try really hard to let this one through and i for one dont think they can do it|pg||
nt|chmitty: Bénédicte a chuté 4@c|pg||
nt|chmitty: sans doute sur le flanc AR de @h suivi de petit @s ... elle a mal deviné|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont like 3S bid|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like a gazilli auction to me...2@c=enq and 2@d is 8+  says Gad viren169 |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: so they're already doing better than the Canadian EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H played by West    so there is risk of @S ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ZZ   simply  A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with trump lead can still make 12 tricks by guessing south singleton trump and ruffing finesses in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that reasonable play when contract is 5@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady still playing   21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rare situation having Muller table faster than other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D was pushed  so only imps from 1st board of the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and potential swing here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened south hand 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: many pairs playing 4@h on this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a number of pairs play "leaping Michaels" over 3-level preempts too|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: probably not being able to show a 2-suiter over a 3@s-opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: including Sadek who alerted his 4@D overcall :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady bid 4@S and Brink 5@C!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Sweden bid the slam so 13 imps in the bag|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to wróc¹ p[iechot¹ wczeniej...i by³oby to jak najbardziej s³uszne|pg||
nt|chmitty: double dummy you do of course, but Bénédicte is not (yet) a magician|pg||
nt|chmitty: for instance is South plays another @s you must play @h to the 9, than the K from your hand ..etc..|pg||
nt|april7: good decision by S, although she has a @H stop, its a female feeling that @C don't break|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lechcold: szlemik treflowy, doæ kiepski|pg||
nt|westjava: decl will go home with this lead|pg||
nt|meargent: i like this result from OR better than the last one|pg||
nt|timb: I would pass 6@S - I hate bidding the same hand twice and 7@D gives the opponents a sure plus|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphznz: a lot of tricks now|pg||
nt|eamongall: I got a txt message the other day from a pard and he says PD sees lots of gazilli in Bermuda Bowl ... that means more updates in my bidding sys  is coming |pg||
nt|viren169: Hi all...|pg||
nt|eamongall: good good |pg||
nt|viren169: This does look like a simple Gazilli auction... and yes a lot of partnerships are playing it now...|pg||
nt|panosk: @d return will puzzle decl but i think will find |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 100 czy 150 nie ma znaczenia w impach|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e kto wie jak jest po japoñsku "wszystko jedno"?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5 level belonged to opponents - so South will try 6 level.  She may be expecting something more distributional for 3@D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: the story i heard   the original notes used ZZ as place holder  but so many people saw draft it was too late to come up with better name|pg||
nt|joanem: good lead - may have to take heart finesse now - that works too |pg||
nt|lechcold: sam impas kier jeszcze nie robi gry|pg||
nt|lechcold: z Pakistanem w Open MUSI byæ taryfa, jeli mamy o czymkolwiek jeszcze myleæ...|pg||

nt|lokaty: po 4 rozdaniach jest +4|pg||
nt|chmitty: just a little help from my friends :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: maybe @S was for @C's|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: @S7|pg||
nt|chmitty: maybe ... but you can't do all with one card : give count and give a preference signal as well|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: right...|pg||
nt|chmitty: id dummy as a singleton @s then preference is the priority|pg||
nt|chmitty: here ot's not so clear|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lechcold: niestety 2BA wypuszczone w  55|pg||
nt|joanem: hard to get to that dummy of course |pg||
nt|april7: N doesn't give up, and S will be in 3NT and will probably finesse for the @C Q and go down|pg||
nt|april7: E should play the 6 and then the 8 of @C!!|pg||
nt|panosk: me and few more fellow viewers :)|pg||
nt|panosk: will claim soon|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lechcold:  5|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||

mb|2H|nt|drorp: now only thought south has is weather we play 6 or 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D would show unbalanced hand  and 1N needs good 12   so deWijs had to PASS|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: running scores can be found here: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||

nt|ritong: le menu de demain, n est pas effrayant, il est vrai  mais tout de même|pg||
nt|westjava: N fly too high|pg||
nt|starkist: nice bid by sharyn|pg||
nt|starkist: if she passes now|pg||
nt|meargent: will reus accept her own invitation?|pg||
nt|chmitty: the French stopped at a safe level on this board|pg||
nt|panosk: 2nt must be invitational with 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Bessis accedentaly passed, she could return her bid from Simons|pg||
mb|p|nt|pawel90: Martens chyba mia³ 2 szanse na wyjcie w trefla nawet|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@h was ready to be passed out if it were S's suit. but Bojoh shot the star after knowing it was @s|pg||
nt|viren169: and now 4@H...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Very diificult reach slam after preempt by S|pg||
nt|ritong: hi tim  hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: hi Henry|pg||
nt|panosk: thx kevin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Versace-Lauria had gadget that made West declarer|pg||
mb|6H|nt|odysseus69: and easy 3NT the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Meyers did not alert 3nt but Levin did|pg||
nt|joanem: jill l did not want to rebid the 6 card poor diamond suit - so 2n is better option |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and an unexpected (to me) alert|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i did not notice if she alerted 2nt bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT must be showing some extras but North sure to pass|pg||
nt|petergill: With @H 5-1, 6@H is doomed and 6@C looks best - hard to reach 6@C if S rebids 2@D and clubs becomes the 4th suit in the auction|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S was enough I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Brown explained double as take-out|pg||
nt|viren169: still a few back to Sweden (I guess)|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like take out ...but when pard advertising 21 hcp approx can be penalty|pg||
nt|copeyj: well this is not going to make very many tricks, it would appear|pg||
nt|timb: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|ritong: hoi harold|pg||
nt|panosk: and the boys http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=SF&qtournid=885|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: or cue bids |pg||
nt|josj: even we have here...|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS playing mini-multi aka Wagner   i.e. always weak 2Major  no strong options|pg||
nt|alunand14: in OR, S opening 4@H|pg||
nt|panosk: really close matches there|pg||
nt|panosk: i think this will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: she did|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 3nt=denies 6 spades or 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: W: My bid shld have been double|pg||
nt|meargent: east= the ex sharyn kokish|pg||
nt|chmitty: il faudra laminer Inde et Trinidad ... et serrer le jeu contre l'Indonésie|pg||
nt|chmitty: une équipe qui joue très très correctement et est en passe de se qualifier|pg||
nt|petergill: but fortunately South rebid 2@C so they are on their way to 6@C|pg||
nt|blewah: previous board. the same 4@s contract but Neve in N led @c5|pg||
nt|blewah: in the other room|pg||
nt|westjava: very nice lead|pg||
nt|meargent: yes she did|pg||
nt|starkist: can duck 1 @h|pg||
nt|edou2704:  in some matches the score is already significant, nederlans is leading by 80 against iceland in BB|pg||
nt|chmitty: I bet a certain % of pairs would play at the 5 or 6 level with these cards, even in a strong field|pg||
nt|viren169: 3 schools of thought here... some play it as t/out and some play it as penalties... and the rest haven't discussed it!|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does 4@D agree @S ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: yep, as much as a slam hand can be boring, this one is quite boring|pg||
nt|josj: but for us Bulletin Editors, coffee is like fuel|pg||
nt|lokaty: ale z 3 2 1 czu³em, ¿e w szóstym bêdzie 0, mo¿e to dobry omen.|pg||
nt|barbyh: made 2 hts in the closed room, diamond lead|pg||
nt|barbyh: 9 tricks here in nt|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D to set up a GF |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: bidding tray is now removed because S needs more room for the @d length :)|pg||
nt|starkist: and the chutzpah|pg||
nt|chmitty: change the @c Jack into @s Jack to start with|pg||
nt|edou2704:  yes but what % ? slam is not good |pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not "recipe" how to bid these hands...|pg||
nt|timb: 2@H looks easier to make than 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: but not easy to reach|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: maybe upgrading East hand is the only way|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: with that many controls|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lechcold: 1@S to pewnie odpowiednik 1BA|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wyjaniono mi ¿e ta pierwsza wersja dasa mat to sposób wymawiania przez Japoñczyków "does not matter"|pg||
nt|lechcold: 4@H by³oby praktycznie nie do po³o¿enia|pg||
nt|lechcold: a przeciwko 3BA bêdzie jeszcze szansa|pg||
nt|mamos: Chagas presumably denied @d control now|pg||
nt|mamos: :(   |pg||
nt|petergill: then 3@C to show 4 clubs, GF|pg||
nt|barbyh: 6 clubs may have some difficulty|pg||
nt|copeyj: likely 3 tricks for declarer, but E/W could make 3N it hink if they could find it|pg||
nt|april7: everything works here, but still only 11 tricks available|pg||
nt|rmb1: The 5 level was looking a difficult place to be and they stopped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't matter on this hand, but switch Martel's minors, then ....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) BAL  1/2/3 NV v V 13-15 else 11-13  4th 11-14  b) 10-15 (4)5+@D  c) 10-16, any 4441|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sry, was problem with loading this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's the last time i'll mention that|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Muller asked for the low heart very fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek made 5@D on 22|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok Rich even for conservative like me its aiutomatic|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1S just showed balanced minimum with less than 4 spades (maybe 3 with some)|pg||
nt|dburn:  no, butit won't go six down, so if Sweden can bid 3NT at the other table...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kamyk: przegralimy 4 rozdania, ale to raptem tylko 17 imp - wystarczy jedna atomowa...|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: a nasze kobiety - no coz, graja w sali chinskiego vugrapha (OurGame), wiec Chinczycy maja nad nimi przewage psychiczna|pg||

nt|meargent: carefull play will make this starting with quacking the @Hs|pg||
nt|meargent: no need now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I think North was talking to himself here making slam suggestions -needed a real perfecto|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale PAK zapakowa³ szlemika w 22|pg||
nt|petergill: The 23-0 scoreline looks like a typical All Blacks Rugby Union scoreline|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, they have a good chance at reaching 6@C if N doesn't discount his @S values too much.|pg||
nt|dburn:  whcih way?|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|timb: Neve needs to return a low diamond to hold East to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|timb: noy easy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: I was remembering Rolands instruction not to be too critical|pg||
nt|reisig: That's my job :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South must receive credit here  for 1Nt was indeed a horrid spot and 2@S  much better|pg||
nt|ritong: t as rien, ma fille|pg||
nt|ritong: dis 5@d paisiblement|pg||
nt|copeyj: can be down 6 now but they would have to defend well|pg||
nt|copeyj: would be a funny flat board - 3N tick and 1@D down 6|pg||
nt|dburn:  no way for Smith to tell who has the last diamond|pg||
nt|copeyj: they are in 2@D next door|pg||
nt|timb: not easy|pg||
nt|rmb1: On board 7. the open room auction stopped at 5@D and West got a club ruff for -3. 12IMP to Netherlands|pg||
mc|12|nt|sybarra: pleasant little hand with @H's 2/1  and @D ace on side etc |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant @H's 2/2 |pg||
nt|meargent: not to mention the 32 @C break|pg||
nt|westjava: to avoid dummy entry|pg||

nt|panosk: best defence cud do was return @C d E shud discard @S on 3rd @D, still this way she wud lose here trump trick leading to same result |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit   what do you think about Playoff for 3rd/4th?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: Canada in touch with the 8 qualifying places|pg||
nt|eamongall: or when a moderate pard ... pauses and rebids 1NT ...I alert and pard looks at me in shock |pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: 6H just a good spot and more importantly a make|pg||
nt|westjava: -2 was best result to NS I think|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@D is 5+ for E/W|pg||
nt|dburn:  here, you might try 6@c and... well, at least the trump break would save you the pain of having to guess hearts for the contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: looks like a good score for Israel here as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|lokaty: chodzi Ci o sta³¹ partnerkê?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: need a french connection now|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 7 should be flat 1370 unless South rebids 2@D instead of 2@C, playing the Artificial Club system that Kamil and Fleisher play|pg||
nt|wstuart: Lew generally defends very well.  It's not often that I will be able to rib him:   about his poor beer defense on this hand.|pg||

nt|sharkey: So 7 boards and a total of 3 IMPs - US needs more "action" if they are to catch up|pg||
nt|ritong: the @d K disappears from south hand, who still has values|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Gaviard asking bid 4@D... Simons smiling... I don't know...|pg||
nt|panosk: 10 imps to France |pg||
nt|rmb1: EW with an awkward choice of final contract|pg||
nt|kit: what about it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be difficult for players to get excited|pg||
mb|r|nt|joanem: possible but depends on too much spade A onside and hearts breaking |pg||
nt|meargent: 4@sS IS AN EXCLLENT CONTRACT if PLAYED BY east ON THE @d k lead|pg||
nt|meargent: i screwed that one up|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 1 @d could mean none |pg||
nt|lechcold: tym niemniej, podniesienie do 2@S mia³o efekt blokuj¹cy...popatrzmy co sta³o siê na drugim stole|pg||

mb|2D|nt|xenya: in the other room, S overbid 2@S at this point |pg||
nt|reisig: 2@s?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not even sure they have to have 1 @D |pg||
nt|petergill: EW System card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/USA%201/stansby-martel.pdf|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: overcalled i meant|pg||
nt|chmitty: allez il faut tenir et jouer les donnes l'une après l'autre|pg||
nt|dburn:  or, of course, you might defend three diamonds - South's pass to that seems conservative, if not downright reactionary|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: so it seems to be non forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: NS might find themselves playing a 4-3 fit here|pg||
nt|xenya: "inv with @H|pg||
nt|xenya: looks a bit strange as N has a fit in either major |pg||
nt|xenya: and things seem to be getting bleak for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: North explained 2@d as Majors. East asked 5-5, North said could be 5-4|pg||
nt|wstuart: I wonder if West will start with the @SJ instead of the @H5?|pg||
nt|petergill: 8 tricks in 2NT on NS cards = just right for NZ|pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: no just the hearts - 52.5%|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they settled for game very quickly|pg||
nt|meargent: doesnt matter how many it promises shirley as long as south leads an honor|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: West is really going to like this splinter|pg||
nt|meargent: good news here was canada didnt miss the @S game in the OR|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D will work nicely, although E/W can make 11 in @D it hk|pg||
nt|ritong: can go down before declarer regains the lead|pg||
nt|timb: EW need the obvious (to us) two club ruffs|pg||
nt|ritong: will|pg||
nt|timb: This looks bad for Neve|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: upmark will continue with noises that get more info|pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|meargent: i must say i would have made more of an effort with that west hand |pg||

nt|ryskiel_: pas na 2@s to moim zdaniem przesadna asekuracja|pg||
nt|chmitty: au bridge tout peut aller très vite|pg||
nt|petergill: Mike Ware does not like (to put it mildly)  2NT as a contract - personally he would rather be in 3NT almost always - except for this hand :)  |pg||
nt|wstuart: EW are playing attitude leads vs NT.  However, I am suprised West didn't lead low from 3 since he hadn't raise.d|pg||
nt|petergill: If you guess @DJ after @HK, @H10 ducked, you can make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: same bidding as open room|pg||
nt|zhoufly: ¶«¼ÒºÜÃÍ£¬3dÉ±³öÀ´ÁË|pg||

nt|april7: S will probably stay in 2@S, making without a @S lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: now probably will see a 3@D bid from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I have seen people dbl with Ss hand many times - I have to agree with S here|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: but this is actually the BB final whilst the USA2-Holland both tables are ""eliminated""-lol|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: this should be a good plus for NZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 23 Drijver opened weak 2@H and EW sold out to 3@H|pg||
nt|eok: Been down all day, but from the main scoreboard you get updated scores. We're playing poorly but had a good win vs Sweden and are on BBO again now and on OurGame tonite. Did you ...|pg||
nt|eok: see my email?|pg||
nt|barbyh: north has to decide whether west has 6 or 7 clubs|pg||
nt|barbyh: if 6  north has to duck the first club trick|pg||
nt|petergill: even if there is a spade switch at Trick 3|pg||
nt|petergill: as is likely with E being almost entryless|pg||
nt|dburn:  final contract unlikely to be three diamonds at the other table - and whatever it is instead may very well be doubled|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a great deal - scope for a double game swing is there for sure|pg||
nt|panosk: low required from W|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this wont succeed at all|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: can N somehow tell his partner to choose the longer major?|pg||
nt|xenya: apparently not|pg||
nt|yuval10: natural @d lead will deem the contract, it seem|pg||
nt|garden2005: a jednak ozorek da³ na 4PC plus dupek 1@s :) dobra gra|pg||

nt|lechcold: czeæ|pg||
nt|meargent: but i doubt it|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S need to be careful not to get too hign here...|pg||
nt|eamongall: Friends of mine went to the Swedish Bridge Festival this summer ... if you are 10 seconds after starting time you are not playing |pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: this won't be a success|pg||
nt|drorp: 2 way CB action, planning to pass 2@D|pg||
nt|mamos: safe partscore|pg||
nt|drorp: once east bid 1NT he has guaranteed 4 diamonds because they only open 1@D with 3 when they have 44 in the majors, and with that east would support spades, so Gino chooses the safe ...|pg||
nt|drorp: 8 card minor fit as his partscore|pg||
nt|grebrof: in scandinavia we call it XY-nt, but I guess two way Check Back is just as good a name|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: coffee again|pg||

nt|edou2704:  3@s should fail due to the bad @s break, Cronier made a good move with her 3@d bid|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: ujn petit ballon d oxygene  il etait temps|pg||
nt|starkist: great slam|pg||
nt|chmitty: the 1@d opening may come from 2 or even 1 card in the Chinese precision system|pg||
nt|rmb1: In open room, they also played 4@S but declarer cashed @SA before taking @C ruff and West could ruff in with @S10. 4@S= 1IMP to Netherlands|pg||
pc|c3|nt|josj: yes but E should find a parking place for the 4th club|pg||
nt|jkotor: ano, 19 wpad³o w 2 ostatnich|pg||
nt|chmitty: hummm ... vite dit|pg||
nt|ritong: encore faut il les faire|pg||
nt|chmitty: je ne crois pas que ça gagne|pg||
nt|viren169: not may entries to South's hand...|pg||
nt|sharkey: This shud be 7 IMPs to US - North's artificial 2@C stole the suit in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: so even if diamonds would break declarer still with 8 tricks... but now probably will be down 3 al least|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: W wins with the K and play J@C and another one, then declarer will know exactly where KQ@d and Q@s are|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer isnt down just yet|pg||
nt|eamongall: they said ... it was very efficiently organised |pg||
nt|viren169: oh dear... this is not good...|pg||
nt|eamongall: good for sweden |pg||
nt|april7: its a better contract thogh, but I think N should have bid 2 @S, although she makes 10 tricks in @H!!!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|davidstern: Club club ruff with @HA and spade towards jack what can the defece do now|pg||
nt|xenya: i've received a few messages saying that it can be made -- yes, i see it now -- thanks|pg||
nt|garden2005: tylko wyjcie w kiera nie wypuszcza nadrobki|pg||

nt|viren169: Good (safe) lead|pg||

nt|edou2704:  in other VC matches : usa2 +40 vs indonesia ; england +35 vs sweden ; netherlands =13 vs usa1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who play it   would 5@C be Exclusion KeyCard??|pg||

pc|h4|nt|drorp: east decided to upgrade his hand to an 18-19 balanced hand, not sure it would be my choice, but rebidding 2@C isn't that appealing either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me   south hand is either a 2@S or 2N rebid depending on partnership|pg||

pc|d7|nt|xenya: this will probably make -- foe 5 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|petergill: I guess the longest suit @H's has least to lose?|pg||
nt|wstuart: Many pairs will bid a doubleton as their preaccept - unless the doubleton is the suit just below their trump suit which would prevent pard from re-xfring|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S still looks doomed, even after this lead|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: cover to encourage @C finesse??|pg||

nt|eamongall: a spec reckons Brown and Stockdale want to play every contract .. |pg||
nt|viren169: dont have 4 losers but dont have 10 tricks here either |pg||
nt|viren169: South will probably try and ruff a @C and pitch one on the @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: the delay in the 4D bid suggests a possible doubt about the meaning of 4C - maybe I am completely wrong|pg||

nt|viren169: @c now?|pg||
nt|dburn:  these days, many play that 3@h shows three hearts whereas 3NT (or 3@s with five) does not|pg||
nt|eamongall: stockdale needs to ruff @Cs and draw trumps at the same time ... its a tough life as they don't let you play 2 cards at once |pg||

nt|viren169: What's new?!?! It always rains in Ireland!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: The doubleton bid helps the defence a lot - it can be better to bid in such a way that declarer's hand less "known" to the defenders. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: every overbid has been punished- every conservative action has been right|pg||
pc|c7|nt|odysseus69: good news|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mamos: I do agree too - experts seem to upgrade for any reason -- " I had three fives?"  and when weaker players do it seems ineveiably to lead to trouble|pg||
nt|grebrof: the thing that maybe makes someone upgrade here, is the vulnerability + they might have an agreement always show 18 when they have 17 and a 5cardsuit|pg||
nt|wstuart: Kx also, will never come back.  It could win by getting a ruff if you catch the ace in the other hand, but with Qx in trumps, he might be getting that trick anyway.|pg||

nt|petergill: On Bd 8, Kamil - Fleisher are in 3NT on a spade lead - a lot might hinge on @DJ guess|pg||

nt|wstuart: that will get them to 6@S.  However, east is going to bid slam himself, and west will likely raise to 7 based on his likely source of tricks in @C.|pg||
nt|petergill: When playing against opponents who play a Forcing Pass over 5@D, maybe 4@d causes more problems for EW than 5@d does. I know it's normal to preempt to the max with a good fit, but ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D - 4@s makes East guess if West is stretching to bid 4@S or not. |pg||
nt|ritong: first being that introducing boss suit is often rewrded|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Again the same problem i am afraid|pg||

nt|ritong: when pard can raise|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: back, sorry|pg||
nt|panosk: theory sugeests that is quite all right to bid 1nt with sinleton but it has to be in a minor to avoid playing in 5-1 of a major if transfer |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|drorp: i'm assuming east bid 1@H to show spades, west's 1@S shows 3 and up to 15 count or so, 2@D is the 2 way CB again, any GF|pg||

nt|meargent: this shouldnt take long|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: 6@c looks like a decent contract which makes on a good day. not today, though|pg||
nt|xenya: but if they do, 6@C is clearly better -- looking at the NS hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: south was reaching for 3@c over 2@s, but put it back|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2nd negative perhaps?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: lool|pg||
nt|odysseus69: either major works|pg||
nt|westjava: when can not?|pg||
nt|blewah: if they play lebensohl or some sort, that 3@c is weak|pg||
nt|ritong: well, perhaps the @s lead will turn out good, if raise is not possible|pg||
nt|starkist: and a 4 card major on the side|pg||
nt|meargent: notice souths pass under 20 points is an automtic pass after partner makes a pre emptive minor raise|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: it is as N says; there is everything wrong with my bid|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is not the sort of deal sweden need i don't think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Versace  4@S West     Kamil didn't realize he was supposed to open South hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|granguru:  good chances to win|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@d (bold) and 5@d got the job done for NZ - the aim being to keep EW out of 7@S|pg||
nt|blewah: no reason for N to continue then|pg||
nt|viren169: no...|pg||

nt|panosk: ptobabilities theory that is|pg||

nt|drorp: slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: screen down..Levin asking questions|pg||

nt|lokaty: jest szansa na +4 impy, bo na drugim stole 3@H +50|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: bidding 6@D might get 6@S from S...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  3N West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no surprise  West opened that hand|pg||
nt|barbyh: in the open room ew were in 5hts dbld|pg||
nt|barbyh: not a good result|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: looks like 1100 and 16 imps USA|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps EW were worried about bad breaks, given how high NS bid on so little|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here 3c is 1 down but it gives N/S a chance of a plus if E-W press on|pg||
nt|viren169: and West with a 4333 min wont go on|pg||
nt|eamongall: 52-3 in imps this set ... they gone into the lead by about 12 |pg||
nt|eamongall: think its time to fire up a 2nd laptop as I am staying here to watch Stockdale and Brown |pg||
nt|ritong: at first sight 3@s is a make, so this slightly offtrack opening seems to lead to a positive result|pg||
nt|panosk: in theory, but also everything else seems much worse|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ryskiel_: 11 dla kraju kwitn¹cej wini|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Newell did very well to make 2@S OR|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: lol...she raised her hands in the air and said 7 hearts|pg||
nt|josj: but an educated gamble at the right moment can be worth a fortune|pg||
nt|blewah: sorry, that 3@c would be stronger hand|pg||
nt|blewah: so that is why N continues|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling that would not be a crime|pg||
nt|meargent: so gordon can pre empt knowing her partner wont hang her|pg||
nt|panosk: *probabilities|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|josj: actually, @DKQ come down with 2 ruffs only so np in the play, I think|pg||
nt|josj: might take some time, however...|pg||
nt|josj: as declarer does not yet know...can't you tell her, Traian, to speed things up?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: ok i will let her know|pg||
nt|josj: :) :)|pg||
nt|josj: Sylvie can't go down on this layout...|pg||
nt|joanem: hard to make the discards on the clubs that;s probably where the 10th trick came from in other room? |pg||
nt|blewah: E trusts the auction|pg||
nt|ritong: although, when you do that, declarer usually saves one trick or even more, warned with bad split|pg||
nt|starkist: devil/made/do/it?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: i have some ideas as to what the first bids meant -- but am completely in the dark abouy the sudsequent bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: Defence must switch to Clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: this could give it all back|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @c .... N has min 3 for his opener|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - 2@s making is an excellent result|pg||
nt|jbgood: needing some help from defense |pg||
nt|josj: all lines seem to work|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: NS didn't ask for explanation, so I have no idea what's going on|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant really cash all the clubs - discard problem for East|pg||
nt|granguru:  great!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: now overtrick  for  yet another push|pg||

nt|sharkey: N saves @D2 in case @D 2-2 and @D3 wud be an entry to dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: players explained all bids were natural from 2@s|pg||
nt|xenya: including 3@S?|pg||
nt|drorp: east playing the safe way for 3 spade tricks, and gets rewarded|pg||
nt|mamos: THAT HAS WORKED WELL|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jbgood: Ware should have 4@h and 5@c for his bids, so GeO was right in passing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room contract much better than this|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: there'll be a post mortem for sure|pg||
nt|timb: it rules out 3NT :(|pg||
nt|panosk: indeed @C 5 maybe indicate diamonds but bear in mind nothing is compulsory, just indicative|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wstuart: There's a whole class of conventions which haven't been fully explored by the laws.  For instance, some pairs (including EW at thsi table) play (3@D)-P-(5@D)-P as a forcing pass.|pg||
nt|kareno: In a BB match I was watching n/s got to 3nt under their own steam, not doubled and down one :)|pg||

nt|petergill: West apparently thought that he wasn't worth 6@h over 6@D, as he had already shown a good hand by passing 5@D|pg||
nt|starkist: I saw worse, getting to 3@c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: vwd indeed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|don_kapu: Now West will return small @S|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: 1 off that's enough so same way for this board|pg||
nt|sharkey: no reason to play @S at all|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless to make declarer go wrong so N shud figure|pg||

nt|panosk: @S lead  in open led to 4@H+1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but would have liked to see Martel's choice over 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: brazil pulled back 2 overtrick imps on 25, defense done well to limit 2@S to 8 tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i vote for that to be last room crash|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=(3)4+ unbal|pg||
nt|garden2005: kamyk*|pg||
nt|wstuart: The interesting thing is that if NS know ahead of time that a pass of 5@D is forcing, they could perhaps extract more out of a hand when they have a 6@D bid by just bidding 5@D.|pg||
nt|wstuart: However, you have to be aware of the opps methods ahead of time.|pg||
nt|starkist: or fold at poker|pg||

nt|chmitty: Lu will be puzzled ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Don't think S will invite to game here so likely a push...|pg||
nt|ritong: downsides are you immediately cancel 3NT and lisome about defensive potential, upside is it could be opponent's hand and they have less room to move|pg||
nt|ritong: lie some*|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like I was wrong.  4@S was a making contract despite 5 losers :(|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H is some sort of responsive flannery 54 in spades and hearts ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: I cannot reaad the explanation, but I certainly won't mention the F word when Roland is around|pg||
nt|rmb1: It is possible to play 1D-2H as a weak hand and 1D-1S-then-2H as forcing with similar suit lengths|pg||
nt|rmb1: spec confirms 2H = 5+@S 4+@H 4-9HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: well...she is thinking|pg||
nt|joanem: splinter |pg||
nt|ritong: alerte= garantit 4 cartes|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think with AKQxx in @C, that west was at least good enough for 6@H, if not 7@S directly.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and 1NT did work better putting me in my place|pg||
nt|odysseus69: again 2H = H + minor |pg||
nt|odysseus69: now because he bid ast time with a 7 count he will know that partner will not be doing same- |pg||
nt|odysseus69: he may bid 2NT to ask for minor then ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: quite usual defence against strong clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: X not alerted S (but by N)|pg||
nt|copeyj: England lead by 58 with 6 boards to compare - and b27 doesn;t look like swing potential|pg||
nt|panosk: disaster in board 26 for France|pg||

nt|meargent: on 2nd thought 6@Cs?|pg||
nt|mamos: this wont be a success though|pg||
nt|mamos: unless North does something odd|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: N asks now already for 2nd time to E if 3@c is really a 6+ card @c; YES|pg||
nt|kareno: The pass by Dianna Gordon could prove expensive on this deal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no upgrade for those nice Clubs?:)|pg||
nt|drorp: i mean i would bid game directly|pg||
nt|mamos: ah :)  that I agree with :)|pg||
nt|drorp: 2@h slightly wild, but in this vul and with pretty solid trumps, it's not dangerous (although i dont see an upside to it aswell)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north hand not getting better|pg||
nt|mamos: nope:(|pg||
nt|ritong: les américains sont légèrement plus procéduriers que nous|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's easy looking at all 4 hands, I know, but surely he was worth at least a try with that @C suit.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South will bid on for sure|pg||

nt|petergill: It depends what 5NT and 5@H would have meant over 5@D and I don't know what 5NT would have meant|pg||
nt|meargent: could?|pg||
nt|rmb1: More specs tell me it is a favourite of West. indeed it is the "Bessis convention" (avoids the f-word :))|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Declarer has gone for a toilet break|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the open room, the Dutch tried 4@H (-1) on board 11, 6 IMP for France|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: That leaves the NS pair pondering about the previous board|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: Kalita ze wzglêdu na trefle nie powinien pytaæ o asy - po 4 kierach jak sugerowa³em chyba by stanê³i w 6 BA|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: hurd asked about the diamond length of 1@d before bidding 2@d. 1@d = 4 unless west has 4432|pg||

nt|jkotor: Danusia siê niczego nie boi!! kto jeszcze wszed³by z karty N?|pg||
nt|lechcold: szansa na 5 punkcików|pg||
nt|petergill: As is his usual style, Mike Ware goes for blood against the weak 1NT |pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont believe that- N orth did well and South could hardly have any more|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder what 1N showed|pg||
nt|ritong: when you are on a rush, for example, you may want to brutalize opponents more than usual|pg||
nt|ritong: even more, that is|pg||
pc|cK|nt|grebrof: not sure dbl at N is the right decision . but ok, I can understand|pg||
nt|mamos: just making sure partner knows your suit is Hearts ?:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Better to open that rag because it is 5/4 with good cards in your suits.|pg||
nt|meargent: and that tony is the argument for passing that north hand|pg||
nt|starkist: I open light and pass that hand|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @D shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: to have a chance to defeat this...|pg||
nt|panosk: as opposed to 4@C that some may prefer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: not going to take long to play|pg||
nt|drorp: he has 5 and a half defensive tricks, he wants to play 2@H double if south has a hand that planned to pass either 2@s or 2@d|pg||
nt|mamos: quicker than I could type it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could be the worst lead for defense|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this match so far has been all about bidding - and thats where the points come from|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 3@H explained as 5+@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@S inferior to 1 NT so likely 1 or 2 IMPs to US here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Could go down with prefect defence |pg||
nt|sharkey: *perfect|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: @DQ 2nd worst|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Cullin will be punished for his DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was going to be hard for Upmark to find @C lead either way|pg||
nt|timb: I think 4@H is too much; 2@S engenders cooperation (and I a fan of the Bourke/Wolff/Landy game try method - bid a game and then try to make it :))|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be only 3rd non-overtrick swing|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has to duck|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznz: South looking at me, trying to see how it goes I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which puts declarer under most pressure now   @C or @S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: divine guidance or the other kind?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they dont seem to agree|pg||
nt|petergill: If @S9 was played from dummy, Geo Tislevoll would have ducked  |pg||
nt|wstuart: The weak NT sort of force the action.|pg||
nt|wstuart: You can't sit back and pass with your own strong NT, so you have to get in and DBL and the IMPs can start flying in either direction.|pg||
nt|petergill: On paper, this is the strongest NZ team I've seen in ages. Last year there was a controversy when this NS pair were not selected in the NZ team after they came in the top three ...|pg||
nt|petergill: pairs in Pairs Trials. |pg||
nt|viren169: good effort!|pg||

nt|joanem: happy to run it to the Q in 4, but.....|pg||
nt|wstuart: Many DBLs at IMPs are actually more defensive in nature - you have to protect potential game scores in other contracts rather than trying to kill the opps.|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's really rather rare that you simply know that the opps have made a big mistake.|pg||

nt|alnanda: still make basic mistakes after play together almost 25 years.. :( :(|pg||
nt|mamos: I think South will be sad later at her mistake :(|pg||

nt|sharkey: Previous board unfortunate for Indonesioa - systemically S had to bid 2@S - cudnt stop at 1 NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: my keyboard is off a little - sry :)|pg||
nt|alunand14: 1NT F1|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised EW didnt bid game OR - US will bid this I think|pg||
nt|barbyh: very lucky game to make|pg||
nt|barbyh: but not so likely with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR East bid 2 NT to describe NT shape and strength of her hand - cud perhaps also have bid 4@C - if this had shown Majors|pg||
nt|april7: another 4@H contract, this time from N and making 11 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: except on a @H lead|pg||
nt|panosk: if W doesnt rise with Q@D there must employed another line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 12  Fleisher in 2@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: West doesn't know what 3@C is..|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd hand where only tarzan passes|pg||
nt|starkist: wish my pards could stay quiet in those situations|pg||
nt|alnanda: tueje have AJ@h 4 card, why worry to tak K@h with A then play J..:(|pg||
nt|mamos: i think many might bid 4@c with that|pg||

nt|copeyj: 2N from Smith now|pg||
nt|dburn:  and in the Bermuda Bowl, at the moment the semis will be Italy - Netherlands and USA1 - USA2|pg||
nt|copeyj: which is 4@H and 15+|pg||
nt|ritong: operator, do we confirm board 12 result?|pg||
nt|timb: I had 4H making 10 tricks; losing 2 diamonds and a club!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 12 corrected 4 @H made|pg||
nt|ritong: merci|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|drorp: i bet this table will be the 1st one in the room finishing the set, they've played 12 boards in just about an hour so far|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think basically you should have a @h-stopper for the 1nt-bid anyway - the dbl mainly shows length and it is a suggestion only - S wasnt fooled to pass :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3major openings normally asks for aces in Ps hand - S has everything|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: now he writes down, aks for stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fallenius in 6@H South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D or 5@D?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H now?|pg||
nt|ritong: soo  back to business|pg||

nt|don_kapu: @D Q lead|pg||
nt|panosk: if 3@C preemptive ok, but if not prefer 3@H like in other room, 3@C bergen or whatever promises alittle help in defence which S doesnt have|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: coffee hand ?  lol|pg||
nt|josj: good idea after all the excitement|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 4 loosers and thats it..this has to be a coffee hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now East chose not to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West may try Moysian|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: can she pass?|pg||
nt|meargent: i have no tolerance for partnership criticism or negativity at the table|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zdaje siê na WE sz³a koñcówka w m³odszy|pg||
nt|petergill: Seniors: Australia back into 8th place with 62 imp lead over Argentina |pg||
nt|copeyj: and 3@S from Smith showing a singleton @S (void @S would have done something else)|pg||
nt|april7: @H ace lead is ofcourse not obvious!!|pg||
nt|panosk: K@D and @D ruff high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if Bocchi makes same rebid if unpassed hand --  i only have their CC and it doesn't have those details|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: i'm told 6@H probably going down|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|kareno: lol|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think they will play 6@H|pg||
nt|dburn:  this is an OK slam - when trumps are 3-2, the chance to avoid two diamond losers is good enough|pg||
nt|april7: but after the @H raise it becomes more possible than after 4 @C and 4@H by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and i was just trying to decide if 6@C has any problems|pg||
nt|lokaty: 7 impów - takiego swingu jeszcze nie mielimy:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: in the open room 4 sp was dbld and made|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: propably N's chewing gum helps|pg||
nt|copeyj: because 1@D opening is either 18-19 balanced or unbalanced for them, they don't need the 2N rebid as natural (they use 1N as a sort of gazilli after 1@D-1M)|pg||
nt|copeyj: time for Brock to wheel out her trusty friend|pg||
nt|panosk: 10 @D is gd in fummy|pg||
nt|panosk: *dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: no comment :)|pg||
nt|meargent: this hand is not a triumph for transfers|pg||
nt|meargent: although 4@Ss should be beat no matter who plays it|pg||
nt|jkotor: uciekam, papa, powodzenia!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Luckily problemed fixed now|pg||
nt|ritong: fine|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: but i couldnt follow the play, dummy with still A QT A8 Q9|pg||
nt|ritong: never mind|pg||
nt|kareno: Perhaps a few explanations of the private jokes would help the specs :)|pg||
nt|starkist: why should I be the only one with nightmares|pg||
nt|starkist: bo is in spec he can explain|pg||
nt|sharkey: BBO Kibs will make this easily....|pg||
nt|copeyj: old blackers|pg||
nt|grebrof: the @c 7 being a good card after this lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: yes good that west didn t get involved|pg||
nt|meargent: at least if north plays 4@Ss the  hand should go faster|pg||
nt|petergill: Seniors : Strong Poland team only 2 VPs from leading the event now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: East has 6 tricks already with 4 cards left Dummy - Q 8 Q9|pg||
nt|viren169: I assume 1@S denied spades?|pg||
nt|dburn:  1@s showed no major, usually balanced|pg||
nt|april7: @C to ace and @S J|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: first you have to reach 6@s, then you have to make|pg||
nt|yuval10: not easy indeed, was played well in the OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know how they play their passed hand sequences :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 2@D specifically asked   of trump|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: well, i gave the information the players were telling. They will probably know :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 2@d was more or less forced|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i think 13-15|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i do not know|pg||
nt|lechcold: na razie..|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêku Kuba|pg||
nt|mamos: they have ebeen swapping imps in the OR  -- an English adventure on Board 10 lost 12 imps but they were quickly regained on 11 by making 5@Dx where Brock's Club switch defeated 3NT ...|pg||

nt|petergill: Support Dbl with 3 @H's |pg||
nt|wstuart: I'm a little surprised N didn't offer 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S set up GF to check for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and on that lead ...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|don_kapu: North force East to rough @D|pg||
nt|barbyh: really?  I dont think so|pg||
nt|panosk: or A@D to be precise|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but 3@h really is mysterious|pg||
nt|garden2005: za co Kubie podziêkowa³e Rysiu? ... napsioczy³ i uciek³ :(|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: za to ¿e siê znalaz³|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead!|pg||
nt|copeyj: 5@C 0/3 and Brock will bid 5N and Smith will sign off I thk|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: if the play record is correct, S won 4@s in the other room - 2 down may be a wrong entry |pg||
nt|sharkey: no - wont make |pg||
nt|panosk: this game is so rich our only constraint is our mind :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|grebrof: with the @hs 3-3 this would be an undebid with this lead|pg||
nt|meargent: en fin|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ...i poszed³:)|pg||
nt|dburn:  no real way to ask about Smith's diamond suit - but this is the percentage action on what she knows so far|pg||
nt|ritong: yes sure  been there  terrible|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: he has 6@s, he has a @d super stopper, but he elects a third possibility with @h xx  strange|pg||
nt|petergill: The 5-0 break stops only the overtrick, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|wstuart: I know he had already showed some type of stopper with 2NT, but after 3@H he could have said he was a little happier about his @S holding.|pg||
nt|starkist: down 2|pg||
nt|starkist: oh|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like new leaders again|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cullin's 4/5 approach good save against game but very lucky he didn't push them to a makeable slam|pg||
nt|copeyj: well she now knew Smith didn't have @DK|pg||
nt|copeyj: so knew grand could not be good|pg||
nt|dburn:  sure - this was a good, controlled auction|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: i had this auction in my notes but no others, so didn't know options/alternative replies|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in 3NT if declarer plays spade to 9 (unlikely) after ace of hearts then North has to switch to diamond|pg||
nt|chmitty: declarer will have to guess @c now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too fast   i was trying to examine play after @C lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|drorp: running the diamond with 10 top tricks could've been seen a bit embarassing if it went K@D, @D ruff, @C to A and @D ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: Geo was worried about inducing a @D lead if he suggested very strong spades via 3NT - and what if partner has Kx in @D?|pg||
nt|wstuart: it's not clear he can't make an overtrick anyway?|pg||
nt|chmitty: and probably won't|pg||
nt|timb: I have a view on leading trumps and not leadin the suit partner has opened or overcalled; it must be "right"' - not that another choice didn't matter; the alternative had to be a ...|pg||
nt|timb: winner|pg||
nt|april7: it comes to late!!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|copeyj: win in hand, 3 rounds of @H ending in dummy, @DA and claim I should think|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|grebrof: well |pg||
pc|hT|nt|drorp: but the chances of that were very slim, and not all saftey plays are worth while, losing 1 imp every time is costly also|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it does look like he made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek playing 3N West|pg||
nt|petergill: but Wayne still has a good point, though it's arguable|pg||
nt|edou2704:  it was better to not cover the !10 at 2nd trick|pg||
nt|edou2704:  @d 10|pg||
nt|ritong: so, in slam we are|pg||
nt|timb: that is the trump lead had to be a winner or not leading partner's suit had to be a winner|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: after opening 1N|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ryskiel_: ajajaj naprawdê? imp w plecy|pg||

nt|alnanda: -2, 9 imp :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no I'm told by one who was watching he was down|pg||
nt|kit: The lead made it less interesting|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: so am I|pg||
nt|starkist: this works also I guess|pg||
nt|ritong: jet pasman will quickly drive to the conclusion that @c A on is needed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: what do you think, yuval?|pg||
nt|wstuart: it's true, @D were scary, but S had to have something somewhere, and it wasn't in @H or @S.|pg||
nt|ritong: find it right, +13|pg||
nt|timb: Playing with my wife many years ago, I led trumps on two successive boards. Knowing my views the second trump lead distracted her. I said at the end of the second deal "What was ...|pg||
nt|timb: the trump lead?" She said "The winnning lead"|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lechcold: rutynowa rozgrywka|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ohh i count - 1|pg||
nt|eamongall: elsewhere Georgio is bringing home 4@S on 25 for about 12 imps to Italy |pg||
nt|dburn:  might have won the first club on the table, to keep the king as an entry to play diamonds rather than having to cross to the ace of spades|pg||
nt|panosk: counting in @C very important from S and she did |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|panosk: exciting hand the last one|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: @D lead against 3N  for declarer's 9th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: has a lot of options now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: playing for @h 3-3, @cK onside or squeezes / endplays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   33 @H or @CK in north|pg||
pc|d9|nt|meargent: draw trumps and go down like a man|pg||
nt|starkist: we don t have a patent on it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Beth has choice of how to go down    a) slowly  b) quickly      "b" is never the selected option|pg||
nt|meargent: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: shouldn't she have played E for @h J singleton?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garden2005: :) Kuba jest od wszystkiego ekspert, ale chcialbym go zobaczyæ jak zagra³by dla reprezentacji|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now - 2 so 380 = 9 imps, will 167 - 163|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 3@c also caused some troubles|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing off the trumps stops any danger of E getting 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: uncertainty about Madala's 2@C rebid  influenced Martel's choice|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chmitty: two down now ... South will be squeezed|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the third heart will do as well|pg||
nt|ritong: ole|pg||
nt|grebrof: now hoing down - S can trow @s on @c lead from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and she knows she is going down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wstuart: I don't think I would have tried to guess the hand perfectly at this form of scoring, either, in order to trump coup east, but I think it might have been possible.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @HQ smother jack  needs extra entry to dummy to pickup suit for no loss|pg||

nt|petergill: NZ 7th only 5.5 VP behind USA1 and Iceland =5th|pg||
nt|petergill: Aus 8th, 3 ahead of Sweden and China|pg||
nt|viren169: It depends on how much red wine he has consumed!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good score EW OR - 4@S only off 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Stansby too strong for 1@S?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: he might have pictured @d xxx with pard|pg||
nt|ritong: who refused to bid NTs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i'm sure de Wijs will think this hand over later today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS opening bids are described as 5542|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the 5@D hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Rosenberg made the good decision to double the 3@H pre-empt at the other table. |pg||
nt|meargent: beth aint selling|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, c est a la vue des quatre jeux que je dis cela|pg||
nt|odysseus69: another spades and minor?|pg||
nt|dburn:  constructive weak two bid - 2@d would show a worse weak two in a major|pg||
nt|panosk: again 3 @C much beter than double|pg||
nt|grebrof: the lead at first trick and the continuance gave her the the contract - as it were|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: no to teraz bêdzie z górki 1-4-7 - 10-13-16...razem 51-23|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good intermediates may convince East to try|pg||
nt|eamongall: at 1130am ...not even David |pg||
nt|viren169: It si red wine in the mornings and afternoons and beer in the evenings and night!|pg||
nt|dburn:  not so far, no - but reacll that it is 12:30 here, and thus the afternoon|pg||
nt|viren169: and occasionally there is an overlap...|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
nt|timb: It was right on the first boar too! :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lechcold: w pozycji Kality Imakura zalicytowa³ 5@D|pg||
nt|ritong: or a cooperative 3@d|pg||
nt|ritong: with a half stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: well |pg||
nt|ritong: next|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you can make a slam against minimal values such as KQXXXX @s K@c A@d then you better do a move towards it|pg||
nt|chmitty: bid 3NT with EW cards is not a success of a strong club system, but let's see what happens here|pg||
nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|april7: although 4 @H are in, that might be the end of the bidding|pg||
nt|april7: nice trial bid, but with 3 losers in @D W will only bid 3 @H I suppose|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@S now and make EW guess?|pg||
nt|kit: matter of style|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: here both N treated their hand has a 7-carded, quite natural when partner is passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D could have game force strength but 0-4 zz|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphznz: eas has 7 tricks...so coffee hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Bermuda Bowl  for Iceland   after  2@D [weak major]  Jonsson bid 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: ofc it's just a small chance - why not go for it?|pg||
nt|kareno: There's nothing more than a possible IMP on this board.|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: live results: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl|pg||
nt|starkist: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=882|pg||
nt|eamongall: 67-6 after 10 innings in Italy China match ....to China |pg||
nt|sharkey: Timid by the American ladies....?|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 hts seems a bit understated|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: again for ina ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@H minimum|pg||
nt|dburn:  so this is a minimum|pg||
nt|panosk: doesnt cost i think|pg||
nt|rmb1: South agreed with a spec who thought 3@S was enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was going to say Kit knows the style more   but the bid was already posted|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yuval10: W took some view to leave 3@h X with 4-4 @s fit|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H puts real pressure on EW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Newell and Reid have relayed to slam here|pg||
nt|pawel90: 4@s chyba nie idzie po kierowym|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not the ideal dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  hand 11 will be on defensive bridge books on 2012|pg||
nt|chmitty: ils ne sont pas partis pour en tout cas|pg||
nt|petergill: Japan in 11th, only 6 VP from 8th..... 8 teams qualify after 21 rounds|pg||
nt|blewah: 1nt is forcing so 2@d is 3+|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c transfer to @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@h ? I don"t know :(|pg||
nt|edou2704:  2h may be transfer, and 3h fit in @s to play by partner ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S instead of DBL??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that clever ruse  let them buy the hand in 3@S|pg||
nt|meargent: EW need to find their @C ruff 2 beat this highly unlikely|pg||
nt|chmitty: elles pardon|pg||
nt|ritong: fine spot|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure what 2N was...|pg||
nt|dburn:  natural and optimistic|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like an obvious pass to me...|pg||
nt|dburn:  but West may have thought it was something else|pg||
nt|dburn:  and this is a so-so game missed - non-vulnerable, one tends not to push so hard|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: OR they are is 6@s|pg||
nt|rmb1: South now considering making the last guess (I guess :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: 4@S wygra lekko...chyba ¿e zostanie postraszony przebitk¹ karow¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: i zagra piki z góry|pg||
nt|brolucius: The same auction as on the other table, as you can see by moving your cursor over the Open Room result (top left).|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: board 29 +1 will correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Deas-Palmer play  "mini-multi"  aka Wagner   i wonder if either of them would have found the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|petergill: BB: Favoured teams from Poland and Bulgaria in 14th and 15th have very little hops of qualifying|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib points out 5@D also a make|pg||
nt|panosk: they seem to be heading there too |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but it's a double-edged sword for sure...|pg||
nt|antoniz: po karowym te¿ nie idzie|pg||
nt|lokaty: nie idze, ale na drugim stole dali karowy i odeszli w atu. Ju¿ sz³o, ale Jessi wzi¹³ asem i zagra³ asa trefl:(*|pg||
nt|meargent: good agressive biddings by NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west should have been worried about this happening|pg||
nt|granguru:  and in the newspapers tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: i think they say 1d with 4-4? so that bid showed 5H|pg||
nt|ritong: jill levin aime son jeu|pg||
nt|chmitty: humm|pg||
nt|chmitty: ça doit pas être ça|pg||
nt|ritong: pour ma part je ne raffolle pas des as secs, mais bon|pg||
nt|ritong: ton?|pg||
nt|chmitty: sur la suivante, il y a aussi un chelem à 50% qui gagne ... demandé par les françaises|pg||
nt|ritong: ton please|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is gonna be hard to make!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he fancies NT rather than 4H - 2nt is too high|pg||
nt|panosk: dont know what 1@S is in open room from N but it sure isnt spades :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|grebrof: I mainly lead offensively and I cant say that I have lost on it - I think its the same with these players: its better to lead something you have than lead something you dont want ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: your P to lead back - it is also easier for your P when it comes to defending if your leads are offensive|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: ns was making 2s..|pg||
nt|pawel90: bêdzie bura w domu |pg||
nt|ritong: we are nervous:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: excuse moi|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|viren169: the dble of 3@C was a bit too early...|pg||
nt|dburn:  but Brock's @dQJ turned out to be useful cards, a fact she could not really appreciate|pg||
nt|timb: I hate opening 1NT on the East cards; but nothing else is better|pg||
nt|april7: E has no other choice than to bid 4@H!! and it works!!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pawel90: albo go na ³awê posadzimy w najblizszym meczu w nogê|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: po co bura - do k¹ta na groch:)|pg||
nt|starkist: time for the queen to play her queen of @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did she have a non-forcing way to show @D? |pg||
nt|meargent: @D lead gives EW a chance|pg||
nt|blewah: should be made, i think. even with that bad break of trumps|pg||
nt|panosk: Q@S asking S shud give maybe |pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: i don't see anything in CC to explain non-use of negative dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: maybe they play DBL denies 4@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the other room, I foolishly suggested that there was no scope for a disaster on one of the boards we have still to see. Of course, I was proved wrong. Learning nothing from my ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: mistakes, I will make the same prediction here.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mamos: n will surely bid 2@s|pg||
nt|ritong: it seems so, yes  dummy is high, except trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: King from KQ or AKx|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: well cashed for an imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  but since CC says neg => 4@S  i would expect entry to show it does not apply here|pg||
nt|ritong: phew|pg||
nt|chmitty: @h switch and one or two off|pg||
nt|eamongall: I guess Sweden don;t open 14-16 1Nt with any 5 major .. |pg||
nt|ritong: also, you know that it will be duplicated other room|pg||
nt|ritong: very likely|pg||
nt|timb: true|pg||
nt|april7: @H @D @H @H @D and finish111|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: privet vlad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H did go down    making Sweden on wrong side of FOUR slam swings this match|pg||
nt|mamos: and the defence should prevail|pg||
nt|wstuart: but it is possible|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think west will exiat a @C now|pg||
nt|petergill: Mike Ware follows the approved Mike Ware plays of "when in doubt, put the opponents on lead"  and "put them on lead so they can make the mistakes"|pg||
nt|chmitty: but still few Imp's to the French|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panosk: N isnt helping at all :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: bounjour Henri|pg||
nt|mamos: loads of tricks now|pg||
nt|drorp: weird choice to play 2nd @d, with clearly no entry to hand anymore, switching to heart would save a trick, 11 tricks will be made now|pg||
nt|starkist: oh the opportunities|pg||
nt|panosk: South sorry|pg||
nt|grebrof: should play small @H to the K, but ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: easier seeing all the hands|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphznz: helpful lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Dk and switch showsed singleton - thank you Michael Rosenberg|pg||
nt|ritong: le mort est parfait pour jill|pg||
nt|copeyj: Notice Smith keeping the @H2 in her hand - not because she thinks she needs it but because it is good technique to keep it - you never know when you might need a low one :)|pg||
nt|april7: small @D first and then 10|pg||
nt|april7: does E have other ideas because it takes so long??|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|lechcold: vugraf z PO co mówi³, ¿e chyba nie nad¹¿y³ za gr¹... mog³o wiêc nie byæ tak jak to wygl¹da w movie|pg||
nt|kareno: I see your point, Tony :(|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: Play in 4@H would be interesting I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 13 [Bocchi 4@H+1]  Fleisher opened north hand 2@S  now playing 4@S|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: Baxter playing 3@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the defence not too difficult but only 50 but a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|viren169: this should go minus with a few more imps to England|pg||
nt|ritong: so, even if it hurts your feelinds, you more or less have to do it|pg||
nt|panosk: been told It's like Take out double and they play transfers and i think so too|pg||
nt|panosk: transfers very popular lately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs 4@H  Stansby might still be thinking about trick 2|pg||

nt|edou2704:  1NT or 1@c ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be 2@H due only 3 trumps - no good alternative|pg||
nt|alunand14: in OR, in fact also pass 2@H.....|pg||
nt|panosk: not on commission, :) Martens is a great player coach and author |pg||
nt|rmb1: On board 11, in open room, South played in 4@H-1  (when EW played 4S= here) for 8IMP to France|pg||
nt|grebrof: huh?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: she played a diamond Espen|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: so now ruffed and discarded two clubs on the @Hs|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
nt|ritong: 32 sans fit franc|pg||
nt|panosk: accidents happen , main point of the game is to sustain the blows and go on unaffected|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe Martel  encourages at trick 1 to prevent a switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: yes - 950 seems good!|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if NS ever open 1N with 5-card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and creates game force|pg||
nt|meargent: in OR canada cleverly found out they were short 2 aces and stopped at 5 level|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie bêdziemy siê k³ociæ:) tak by by³o|pg||
nt|granguru:  @D8 asked for a @H return, as there was a great danger of losing that trick in the @C suit length|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sounds like my kind of guy - except for being fun, handsome, and a good bridge player.|pg||
nt|wstuart: '|pg||
nt|wstuart: lol|pg||
nt|blewah: Murniati 1 off in 2@s when Cronier made it here. 5 imps to France|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: players scored 110 when South claimed but i think it will be 90...|pg||
nt|ritong: obvious raise to 2@s, imo|pg||
nt|rmb1: France opening up a lead. with 2 boards and final set of 16 boards to go|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-14|nt|drorp: some lazyness from Gino there, it's not like they're 20 mins late...|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess a fit jump to 4@h was unavailable...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: forcing or semi-forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Palmer will now show 4-fit  but i don't know their step responses|pg||
nt|ritong: and there we stay|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: first in the restaurant for dinner?|pg||
nt|grebrof: how old are these guys anyway - I know Israel has a lot of talented juniors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone will rue balancing|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table, in 4@H, declarer needed dummy's low trump for a spade ruff (the way the play had gone). Rosenberg made the good trump lead and continued trumps at the key ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: moment. Declarer had to win high in the dummy but played the four and then ran into a trump promotion.|pg||
nt|vugraphznz:  board 30 corrected|pg||
nt|starkist: 5 level at risk|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 6 minutes playing time left|pg||
nt|meargent: in this room NS might even be more clever and stop in 4@Hs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: weak Nt getting extensive run|pg||
nt|april7: now a slam try is possible and if bid good guesses are very necessary|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D some sort of heart support |pg||
nt|panosk: maybe a bit beter point wise from striaght 2@H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N =    unexpected|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: that was a nice pass by N, if he X then his side might've run into some big troubles|pg||
nt|ritong: fine move by north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this mechanism means they'll have lots of room below game to learn no slam|pg||
nt|starkist: other room south must have got bergens mixed up to go slamming|pg||
nt|petergill: Lead now 36 imps after Newell and Reid beat the 4@S then bid the grand slam|pg||
nt|wstuart: The lead was from teh other side on 4@S - the @HA was lead and there was no inference to be drawn as to the location of the @SQ|pg||
nt|edou2704:  tea time already ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: its past midnight here and I have an 8 week old daughter having her first flu  - sorry - not sleeping enough|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: very few imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most pairs that play transfers would bid 1@S with 3-fit and weak NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: needs guts to do that|pg||
nt|xenya: good decision by N not to compete further|pg||
nt|jbgood: GeO was not as tempted as Lall at the other table - and passed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a useful 8 to the Kiwi with 1 to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has 4 tricks in the side suits and needs to add six trump tricks.|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d 4SA|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d shows @h|pg||
nt|rmb1: South's choice over 1@S would have been harder if partner had bid @H.  Do you just bid NT and hope defence don't have 5 tricks in the unbid/unstopped suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|drorp: interesting choice by Gino here, deciding to go slow so he can represent his shape, rather than making a wild preempt at a big level (like 5@D :))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek's PASS looks much better to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs is known for his agressive bidding in competition, doesn't let the opps play at low level|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably forcing|pg||
nt|joanem: 4s is aggressive thought she woudl bid 3s after 1n|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no bad breaks so no problems|pg||
nt|starkist: splinter|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure about this|pg||
nt|ritong: rather a cue with @s fit|pg||
nt|copeyj: Sweden bid 6@H on 29 next door too - well done to (presumably) flatten the board|pg||
nt|copeyj: aggressive opening, but don't forget N/S play precision so openings limited|pg||
nt|ritong: simons applies " no way they play raised 2M quietly"|pg||
nt|panosk: that the reason why as i was told, they play 2@h = transfer for @s|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@d simple fit|pg||
nt|panosk: 1 thing i can tell you for sure this fight will be exciting till the end so dont miss next 2 sessions today |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: south must feel he hasn't shown his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: by at least a king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  1N-3N   makes more sense to me|pg||
nt|granguru:  and even if it werent so, it shows a great defensive hability by the E player|pg||
nt|ritong: ou 2SA mini maxi|pg||
nt|blewah: or @s raise, Henri?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - S kept it open and launched EW into 4@H...|pg||

nt|dburn:  maybe - a heart lead might have left declarer guessing a bit|pg||
nt|viren169: the trump lead wont do any harm to declarer|pg||
nt|viren169: Decarer will set up the diamonds for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|timb: I'd need to be on some severly mind altering drugs to double 2@s for takeout on the West cards|pg||
nt|timb: This is down two|pg||
nt|ritong: i m not scandalized|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and another partial|pg||
nt|grebrof: the dutch girls need a big swing soon|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: almost impossible i think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so East could bid 3@H on the next round.|pg||
nt|grebrof: I can agree|pg||
nt|grebrof: the french ladies are also in a streak, winning several big events lately - both mixed and female honoutables|pg||
pc|s5|nt|drorp: Gino and Ronpa are both in early 30s, Gino ex junior for many years, i used to practice with him alot back in his junior days|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: what a lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: surprize lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H was 1 down but 130 better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice confident stop|pg||
nt|ritong: indonesia in the right contract again|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@S by Sjoberg a good bid - Rimstedt should bid 3N now I should think|pg||
nt|copeyj: and they have protected the @D tenace|pg||
pc|sA|nt|starkist: push, nice little win for Canada against titans|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: oeps|pg||

nt|alunand14: how do you think about this board, Carl?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mamos: two or three specs have pointed out how ell EW Brock Smith are playing - I think thats very true - they certainly were heading the Butler for the Venice Cup last night|pg||
nt|ritong: surprenant|pg||
nt|petergill: "handsome"? I think Mike himself might say that he's only handsome when you compare him with the meagre standards set by other male bridge players|pg||
nt|starkist: I might open 1@d with north hand|pg||

nt|copeyj: the foul @C and @S break dooms this it seems|pg||
nt|panosk: shud make with this lead for sure|pg||
pc|d2|nt|drorp: Ronpa is a big talent but started bridge somewhat late, so he missed on the junior circuit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would bet that Sadek is in the minority and that most won't be able to resist balancing DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: needs to lead a trump to beat this, i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since the auction is forced to game, it can be difficult for the players to know if partner has extra values. 3NT is an important bid on the way to a major-suit game. The Serious ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT shows extra values during cue-bidding, the non-serious 3NT denies them. You can play it either way. |pg||
nt|starkist: not the dream dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: no doubt he has seen partner's openings brfore|pg||

nt|panosk: now declarer has to make some choices is lead from KQ @D?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|odysseus69: jack of diamonds looks right now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West likely to have 1 king - if spade king all well - if diamond king then play for K10 or doubleton 10 with East|pg||
nt|timb: I'm with Mike Lawrence and Andrs Wigren; the so-called "Law of Total Tricks" is nonsense; a fraud and an emporer without clothes|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: accepté|pg||
nt|petergill: 8 easy tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|grebrof: I started at 26y too - still talented :P|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like we are on a coffee break...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panosk: if so J@D is entry|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: for the last round, france will have a presumably less tough opponent|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphznz: Wlochy-Holandia: prawie 5800 kibicow w PO!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thats the end now - diamond for ruff would have given defence a chance|pg||
nt|alunand14: so, 4 imps again for INA ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: missed the good @S...|pg||
nt|sharkey: 8 trricks now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|copeyj: only 10 imps in France-China (France) and 16 imps in Netherlands-USA I (Netherlands)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and this board can only help the french team|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|alnanda: push board, 2@h easy to make|pg||
nt|copeyj: All the bermuda bowl quarters seem decided (Italy-China the closest with 25 imps in it)|pg||
nt|panosk: and a trick :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: nope  no 2nd entry to West hand   so still 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|alunand14: yes, push :)|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HJ never comes into play|pg||
nt|edou2704:  a quiet contract for GU, every one can rest before last board|pg||
nt|kit: I really haven't seen him play enough to judge|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: Nabil did very well to bid 3@H  as well he should after Saaid's sequence of RDBL and 2@H|pg||
nt|lechcold: tu bêdzie remis, ale w 16 szansa na du¿y zysk i remis w meczu|pg||
nt|petergill: An attacking red suit lead would have led to 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lechcold: nie uciekaæ!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: will need to play @c Q|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|timb: The so called "Law of Total Tricks" is ably shown to be a nonsense in Lawrence and Wigrens "I fought the  law of total tricks". Its a furphy; get over it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher 4@S went down    so another 13 for Italy|pg||
pc|c6|mc|7|nt|ahollan1: on this hand after same start, Kamil did rebid 1@S so  1N from North|pg||

nt|petergill: I doubt if Bach - Cornell (2 big names of NZ bridge) have ever been possibly the 3rd (or =2nd) pair in a NZ team ever before |pg||

mb|1N|nt|ritong: and a possible last swing|pg||
nt|starkist: oh yah one more board, will put the beer cap back on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if EW wanted to save   East needed to bid over the artificial 1@H  but if unable to show 2-suiter  she was stuck|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|viren169: lol...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the story of this match is the one big swing on Board 21|pg||

nt|ritong: well, if we are at that, and if you have good french, an idea can be to purchase jean rené vernes " bridge moderne de la défense"|pg||
nt|ritong: as a document|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd 16 boards  start in 1 hour 40+ minutes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: with what looks like a good result for Israel, when 4@h is cold|pg||
nt|ritong: that would tie the match  not sure 2 imps is worth 1 VP|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder how 4@H went down in the OR|pg||
nt|ritong: relatively naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: north led a @c, ducked|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't have an indication from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: then grue draw @h A in order to avoid a possible guess later|pg||
nt|ritong: then the roof fell on him|pg||
nt|yuval10: here it looks like South would bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Americans have been a disappointment to me in this match - but quite a long way to go before the KO stages|pg||

mb|p|nt|drorp: pachtman had very good hand for hearts, but didn't realise the 7-5 distribution, looked more like 6-5 or 7-4|pg||

nt|drorp: Gino's tactic didn't work out, personally i would just blast a big diamond bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller not opening strong club here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H actually could be 5@H 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: with 5-5 they rather open the Major first, before they are being preempted to 4@s|pg||
nt|pawel90: szlemik nie jest ³atwy|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when they said  you can't preempt with 4 of other major or a void  they forgot to say it was no-no with BOTH|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|drorp: chagas may have found the bid that will get them to slam|pg||
nt|drorp: needs to find another bid now|pg||
nt|drorp: very tough slam to bid, based on the 10 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hardly Chagas "duty" to bid slam, but I guess S has one more bid if Chagas can dig up some @d-support|pg||
nt|mamos: Will EW pass if he bids 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: woow..the french team are looking for english blood at the 1 level|pg||

nt|ahollan1: actually  1@H with 5@S may just apply to 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs passing, probably expecting 2@s with Muller, since the opps didn't overcall 2@s or raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good stop|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: that 5@C overcall is somewhat -- er -- exotic... |pg||
