nt|gluckenval: 5M too, and the openings bid at level 2 are in the range 10-13|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with DBL promising points/values @s game wouldn't be an overbid|pg||

nt|grebrof: I am actually just thrown into this, si I have to admit I dont know the district here - or is it different districts competing towards eachother?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may produce a swing since 4@h appears to make for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|Zmud99: as we miss aunction we just display final contract on this board |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Did w actually bid 2@H on that?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: East wondering what is happening here!|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: this 3 @d was not from lessons in bridge-book -but looks winner|pg||

nt|hantveit: why not dbl 2c?|pg||
nt|frm: Er det ikke fuldt tilstrækkeligt at melde 4 SP ovenpå 3 NT? (Ville 3 SP ovenpå 2 RU i øvrigt have været krav efter Ø-V´s system?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|paulg:  excited that I'm doing USA 1 vs USA 2 :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow you are?|pg||
nt|paulg:  with Roland and Bill|pg||
nt|baldjean: this auction only works if in your methods a double of 1@h always mean 4@s|pg||
nt|baldjean: means*|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: why?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South has a good playing trick hand - 3@h a possibility   |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but too good def. i think its right to pass|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|santyclz2:  Both methods have  plusses and minuses.|pg||
nt|paulg:  which, with all due respect, is not as intimidating as doing it with Larry Cohen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Thorvald Aagaard|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Zmud99: of course Piekarek didn't open 3@D|pg||
nt|grebrof: 4@s is still a slamtry in my world|pg||
pc|s8|nt|stoffers: good lead, down now as declearer played 'safe' |pg||
nt|santyclz: That seemed more likely until the continuations.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bjr à tous|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|psyck: we seem to be missing the auction other room, but it cannot have been as good as here anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: E is Zia, for those asking|pg||
nt|psyck: Fantunes, Welland/Zia ,Helgemo/Helness, Quantin/Bompis , Bessis x2, Smirnov/Piekarek, Bertheau/Nystrom, Brogeland, Versace etc feature in this tourney... |pg||
nt|psyck: a 9 match round robin a,omg 10 teams|pg||
nt|andyv:  Matias, do we know if 2@h was polish style showing 5@h and 5 of another?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|penseur9: bonjour|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT is 11-14 - and EW never have max :) - then they upgrade :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ybob: level 3 is short by 1 trick for both side|pg||
nt|sybarra: but difficult to stay off the 3 level imo |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@S = 110 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: which fits the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: me too, but I know some people who would|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|penseur9: playing low spades to try and prevent declarer to go to dummy|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|runnerup: shortage of entryes made this +1 and it looks very normal|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hantveit: anyones guess|pg||
nt|santyclz: It looks as if we're in for some imaginative bidding this round.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ace to prevent the overtrick.|pg||
nt|hantveit: well, the good thing is that this gives us action already from the start. they stopped in a normal 1N in closed|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: it is about a 30.5% slam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hantveit: maybe 2H was a kind of TO ? but I have to emit, i have never heard about such a thing before|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: claims ruffing a @c and a @s|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  EW had good sacrifice here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: different countries, different sins|pg||
nt|penseur9: great defense|pg||
nt|pelu: and Martin Schaltz (the son) also on the Odense Team|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead with singleton @S don't need - with xx in @S more chance to beat the contract leading @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7@H is a possible lead because North know that East is strong, so probably find the K in @h in North hand|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, in modern times people are not very timid about their weak openings - can be 5, can be 6, can be 5-5 or whatever - personally I suggest you diverce them|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: good start for BK Nord|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|hantveit: Even if north showed 0-7 and 5h, south should bid 4h|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: The format of this tournament is that every district have a competition to find out which team should represent them.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: The district who is defending champion get to send two teams|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat1001.html for standings|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: If you bid with that hand I think it's because you dont feel as comfortable in defense as you do as declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: nice 4@S here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do EW play a weak or strong NT....ah, weak|pg||
nt|ybob: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: alert said 10-13 |pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: 6h is on withouth club lead|pg||
nt|hantveit: 20-10 points, so should stop|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H N/S seems the max here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|stoffers: Nunes had to have exactly doubleton for playing the ace to be wrong, + 0-3@h ofcource. Unlucky by Gromov!|pg||
nt|gluckenval: about the lead of the italians, they have a 3 pages of supplementary sheets for their slavinsky leads... i.e. with 83 the lead is rev. (small from 2 cards)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but not in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  awkward hand for North .. 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||

nt|ady: hi Andre|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like NS kan make a slam in @H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: @d for no loser was about 62% & of course need @s fin...|pg||
nt|psyck: for 1 loser i meant|pg||
nt|stoffers: declearer will have some pressure on 5 rounds of spades, and need to find the Q@c to make this|pg||
nt|hantveit: but if we look on lousers, there is 12 tricks. (24-8-4=12 tricks)|pg||
nt|hantveit: losers|pg||
nt|santyclz: 12 tricks in @hs, unfortunately e-w have 2 first.|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Herve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Probably not.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: What a start to this 12 board match!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Bærentsen taking his time :) I understand his problem|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Zmud99: There's 2 session in this Patton - Session A (afternoon) and Session B ( tonight ) - Each session play 4 matches of 8 boards - Session A and B best teams will qualify for tomorrow |pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat1002.html  standings after 7 rounds of 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: how?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2@h is constructive here, so EW probably play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 20:20 HCP both sides and likely NT.|pg||
nt|pelu: only 12 tricks NS on lead @CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: E knows his partner (not bidding on to 3@s) or what do you think?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts and another, Bill?|pg||
nt|pelu: EWs Cc say Acol standard, but the play 5 card major (and that is NOT Acol)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but I dont now their system |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but the two teams cannot come from one club|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like down 1|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good decision of south here to open 1s. 7 losers an 4S is often playable if partner holds support|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: BK 1936 and Odense BK come from the same district|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H=transfer to 3@S, but South would probably have raised anyway |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: EW play 10-13 1st and 2nd seat NV|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi!   12 clubs are playing round robin for the titel ...from various districts of Denmark|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/Resultat1003.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  W has to find @d switch now|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, if they take it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not any more.|pg||
nt|penseur9: lookis like 4 loosers here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not sure |pg||
nt|ady: on top|pg||
nt|dkkello:  could have stold the pot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@S could show a good raise of some sort in @s maybe thats why:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: weird bidding by E|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S is safe|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s doesn't make because of the 4-1 @s break|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: he overcalled :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looks like 11 tricks here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: the last CC we have for NS is : http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c is a little precipitous|pg||
nt|hedyg: they have made some changes since..|pg||
nt|hedyg: no CC for EW|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back Hedy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed for the contract.|pg||
nt|thorvald: Good old Leo Pedersen that recommend that if you have an ace against a slam, lead it|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry not even on that lead :(|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: they are from Genova, Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Paul :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3NT would probably have been the choice of most, second choice 3@s|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Rankings before last match : 1) White House 137  2) Bonori  136  3) Zimmermann 133  4) De Botton 129  5) Patane 126  6) Italia School 124  7) GIB 121  8) Ward Platt 120  9) Corsica ...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 120  10) Brondi  116    Top 6 teams qualify for Quarter Final tomorrow ( plus 2 teams from Patton B )|pg||
nt|dkkello:  North and East are well known to bid a lot |pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will be looking at this with interest, particularly the fact that NS are vulnerable|pg||
pc|h6|nt|runnerup: some chancce for -2 now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the match is very close, so each and every imp counts|pg||
nt|hantveit: a wash, and next|pg||

nt|kjadams: 1 imp for Bonori on 1st when declarer opted for a heart finesse rather than a double squeeze.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Both lines look close to even money|pg||
nt|paulg:  Nunes also senses problems for them|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I guess H and another, or H + minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|hantveit: 1S, 2D and 1C loser in 4H, might be imps back to ns here, as 4S is a possible contract in open|pg||
nt|grebrof: almost like out team champs in Norway, except its a cup where the locals play eacchother the first rounds and then the away team has to travel further and further - leaving 8 teams ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: where the hometeam (the event changes site every year) is prequalified|pg||
nt|grebrof: Trond here has actually won this event in Norway|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has some work to do to make sure not to go down more than one|pg||
nt|hantveit: the negative in my opinion is that they place the final in small places with little or no spectators, and with a long travel for the players|pg||
nt|andyv:  a trump lead by S would probably have been better.|pg||
nt|grebrof: cant say I like Ws 2@h - for me 3@h is obvious|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 3@h does take away the cue bid|pg||
nt|hantveit: I have too say that I think I would bid 4S over my partners 3h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, he has passed - oh well|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if double was not penalty, as South looks too strong for 3@s opposite a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hervé!|pg||

nt|Zmud99: 3 world champions at table|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|psyck: work on minors or ruff @h?...|pg||
nt|kjadams: this hand, I can't see any line to avoid a loser in each suit, so down 1 will be best case, and down 2 seems possible.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not the best lead on this hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gluckenval: cut & paste from their leads... i.e.: K6532 = 2; K653 = 6; 9832 = 2; 983 = 9; 92 = 2;|pg||

nt|vugraphzsa: Very difficult bid for N, but I think 4@h was too little.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  haderslev is next to the border of germany |pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome Jeanine |pg||
mb|1N|nt|runnerup: how many @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: in these short matches of only 8 bds when you lose 800 the match is practically over|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok folks, cool pls, the Bermuda Bowl doesnt start till Sunday!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13, 5+ cards, unbalanced|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14+   5+ cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: forcing|pg||
nt|thorvald: Third 11 HCP opening hand in a row|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 4@H EW , safety 5@C by NS|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  how many @s rather :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: i mean west bid -5 @d is even possible -some do |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  your bets? 4@d vs 4@s? higher stakes?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I'm a 4 bidder both ways...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even 5@d with indicated @s lead look quite fine|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, they play real bridge, not double dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 1Nt by S - they play 12-14 nv 1. and 2.|pg||
nt|pelu: after a Nordic Championship - many years ago, Axel Voigt calculated that the danish team would have scored more VPs if they have stayed out of all slams|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: interesting board|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|hantveit: a cold seven as we can see, they stopped in closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: 2 @c and 2 @s -3|pg||
nt|ady: who ever plays goes down|pg||
nt|dkkello:  pas and it is west thinking?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C on CC: Capalletti - d u know that convention Kello - or kibs?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Ewa? |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 19 bal, so 1Nt isn't sufficient|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d multi|pg||
nt|baldjean: Hi Shirley; nice to see you again|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ybob: sry @C ruff|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @h -is 2 down -@d ruffs -3nt ns |pg||
nt|stoffers: 3 or 4@s Nunes?|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2H is a bit weak for my taste|pg||
nt|santyclz: 16 top tricks.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = onknown 6 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: @D ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 losers only, strong suit, and a H in partners suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: kalispera Manos :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H relay, at least invitational|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam possible here I'd think|pg||
nt|thorvald: That wasnt a clever double|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: partner will bid 5@c|pg||
nt|thorvald: With 4-card support it is almost always better to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Remember that the 1@s bid by Nunes shows a good hand.  Lessor hands are opened 2@S.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also 1@D is possible by West|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: hard to plat 3NT when opps bid 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 10-13, unbalanced|pg||
nt|pelu: the D from S = dont bid again - I can defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looks like 790|pg||
nt|thorvald: Agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like another weak nt |pg||
nt|mdgraham: can NS stop out of game|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ybob: play|pg||
nt|andreasw:  is it spelled wrong ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hmm |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Ace|pg||
nt|baldjean: a bit timid, in my opinion, since oppolsite a 1nt opening N appears to have a lot of entries|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup: 4 @d is a winner -but you cant bid it anymore|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 10-13 (good 9) 5+.|pg||
nt|stoffers: bad splits here, but will bring home 10 tricks easy|pg||
nt|gluckenval: obviously, in 3rd seat and not Vul they are undisciplined :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: should North take control of the bidding here?|pg||
nt|kjadams: Spades will make 3 or 4 here.   Club suit frozen, but tough to arrange a pitch.|pg||
nt|pelu: yes Capelletti|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: worth discussing with your partner if 3@h is forcing in this auction (if not 2/1 FG) |pg||
nt|grebrof: pass?|pg||
nt|sybarra: if 2/1 he is in game force  |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hantveit: still, they should be able to find it now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is like the previous hand ... North has all the wrong cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And this will go down a large number of 50's ... should East have hit it?|pg||
nt|penseur9: the dealer must be as tired as the players at this hour :)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H might have made|pg||
nt|bridge_one: push board|pg||
nt|andyv:  delayed dbl is take out of @hs|pg||
nt|baldjean: and the answer is yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: we heard the screech of brakes |pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  Some pairs rebid 1NT with the West hand, but never in France |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: EW lead 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|dkkello:  3 @S high enough :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: system matters here; is this the way they raise to 2NT (in which case 2NT need not promise a four-card major)  |pg||
nt|sybarra: probably    -1  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 2N over 1N would be natural|pg||
pc|c6|nt|runnerup: the moment of truth|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Drum-roll, please...|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks to go -1 ok|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lead something and claim, please! 13 more boards to come|pg||
nt|hantveit: 5S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ybob: only @D lead defeat it|pg||
nt|runnerup: North saved -and no @d lead -so winner|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6C|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think West has to balance at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 3@h is NF, probably 3@S with no great enthusiasm|pg||
nt|grebrof: over 2nt (assumingly not GF) W would bid 4@h I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i dont think 2/1 is GF and i also think that 2N is NF|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no 4@h- well, the hearts are so much stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: 62 instead of the 52  right |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ybob: for that was better bid 4@D over 3NT|pg||
nt|hantveit: 7H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many people who play 2/1 reserve a 3@h rebid on this auction for a solid suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: if partner holds xxx in dia, it is still a 52% chance to make. dia 2-2 or dia q drop|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Tez :) welcome|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2c!=singlesuiter|pg||
nt|baldjean: I doubt that even 3@s will make; I see 5 losers.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: I don't think he can double 3@D, partner did not have to be this strong|pg||
nt|dkkello:   commands p to bid 2@D|pg||
nt|dkkello:  pass/correccct|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hantveit: might bid 6d on the way|pg||
nt|hantveit: wereas Multon will be given the honor to bid 7H|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  not without risk of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW stay out of game that requires the @h finesse to be on.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: With the @H10 and @cace onside and the j dropping this should make an overtrick.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how cards lie this will problebly make 7 tricks...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Ewa: , she knows a lot! : a very inferior defense to 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: with the W-hand I would start with @D10 and hope for at doubleton by partner|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Ewa has to get out of Bangkok!! Armagedon ... |pg||
nt|dkkello:  ewa90 (Privat): because in cappalletti 2@D shows both majors - and with equal length partner has to commit to a major whilst in multilandy they can simply bid 2@D to let overcaller decide the|pg||
nt|dkkello:  major to play in|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well.. schaltz can make now playing small @c since W has no more @S so @s K will be an entry and then an endplay in @d at last|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hantveit: north might be afraid a pas on 6D...|pg||
nt|santyclz: @h q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, as looks like the case here, 2@c does show a 4 card-major, so South can show his spades, and, presumably, non-game values |pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's problem here is that west can get in with the @CA and draw a third round of trumps|pg||
pc|h8|nt|stoffers: Well judged by Gromov to double the third time (pass forcing), if he had passed i am sure dubinin had bid once more. That said 5@d or 5@h is very unlucky not to make|pg||
nt|gluckenval: def. borderline... I really don't like so much when I'm going 3 off... I think a good sacrifice bid should be for 1-2 off, no more|pg||
nt|stoffers: well, this is 2 off|pg||
nt|stoffers: Needed club-club lead and ricing with A@s to get it three down, tough to do that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I agree ... too tight at imps|pg||
nt|kjadams: The term "frozen" means neither side can lead the suit without sacrificing a trick.|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi william|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Can 3@h go down?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I don't see a way of making this|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|stoffers: -3 now i guess|pg||
nt|stoffers: Short of trumps, good defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think East was in a more difficult position, tough to overcall 2NT with the source of tricks destroyed|pg||
nt|hedyg: as they say cinquanta il pezzo|pg||
nt|ady: caash out job|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont get W at all.. he must put partner with a trick after switching to another suit then @d.. then why not just play a small @D first? even thought he problebly only will get 5@d it will go down the when putting partner with a trick?...|pg||
nt|grebrof: hi all|pg||
pc|d6|nt|santyclz: Well done.|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this auction 3NT clearly stands no chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good result for NS in the CR.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  i don't think I've ever said that|pg||
nt|hedyg: never played against Italians?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they know my limitations|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|dK|nt|grebrof: re|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably better to play the A@h...if E had lost to stiff K@h, this contract could be going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: we had a lot of connection problems yesterday and it seems to continue|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mathat: thinking to retern @d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And as it's turned out, probably very difficult for the defence to find the way to beat this three tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Basically West at some point had to cash the 3 major suit tops, and get out with @CJ|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hi|pg||
nt|ybob: hi :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|athene: but the @DJ comes down with only one diamond ruff so all should be ok|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure S sh pass to 4@S - or even bid 5@H - he "know" partner must be void in @S, so no wasted values here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|baldjean: so I would have gone to 3nt as North|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gluckenval: now @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  but on a less descriptive auction you'd prefer to be in 3NT than 5@d|pg||
nt|hantveit: hard to find the game. west has a normal 2d, and east has too many losers|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|mc|9|nt|andyv:  agree, although 10 card fits always seem to produce more tricks than 9 card fits:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Nice defense by Rømer, but Ankersen should have played the Q of @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: commenting on the small places they often have the finals: we had to travel 4h30m with 2 ferries in a first round vs a "local" team once - so topography in Norway is not perfectt ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: for eventts like this|pg||

nt|sybarra: same here, Mike,  re 1nt -2nt,  so only way to invite is via stayman|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psyck: a hand that only Roland would find interesting here|pg||
nt|ybob: slam time ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: i agree -4 @d -for lead ,but can you think about lead against 4nt in that |pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont get W at all.. he must put partner with a trick after switching to another suit then @d.. then why not just play a small @D first? even thought he problebly only will get 5@d it will go down the when putting partner with a trick?...|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: oups... same at other table :(|pg||
nt|kjadams: the other table shifted to clubs vs game which gave up the extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: i guess if one pair stops in 2@H and the other reaches 3@H, it's just that the pair in 3 loses imps sometimes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kjadams: 5 imps for stopping low on board 2.|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Duplication error on board 3 - we will go to board 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Another slam board. Who dealt these cards?!|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: weak NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: anoth biggy here|pg||
nt|hantveit: but as noone is holding a longer suit, it is harder to bid it.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i have more confidence in them reaching 3NT this time|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hi|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, the result is that you miss 4-4 fits in @s when opener has minimum, but you gain more information about the opening hand rather than the 1nt-3nt : which fails more often than ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: most think|pg||
nt|baldjean: my partner and I use pre-transfers to majors when transfering to minors. Example: 1nt -2@h-2@s-3@c is a transfer to @d and not to @s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: interest |pg||
nt|sybarra: *interesting |pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: of course not|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hantveit: it should not be bid either I think... what do you guys mean?|pg||
nt|hedyg: N wishing she had made a bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: like 1@s|pg||
nt|kjadams: Could have led clubs once, but not twice, if lead Q.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: for 2 reasons...|pg||
nt|tez: if they play 1@c 1@d 1NT(May have 4 card major) ...they could stop in 3 NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: on  2, the CR in 2@H +2 for 7 IMPs Las Girafes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: N/S can probably make 6@h here, but it's a difficult spot to reach|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do you find this gives the opps more doubling opportunities? |pg||
mb|3D|nt|stoffers: 4@s was one off if Dubinin played @h at an early stage, 5@c is makable because K@c is always single :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: seven is only on if no club lead, trumphs breaking 3-2 and heart 3-3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally weak NT is 10/12|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  strong @c in action - E is entitled to bid knowing partner has 17+|pg||
nt|runnerup: now west will overbid -yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry was checking why 3NT was -3 last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if 1@s is diamonds or 3 controls?|pg||
nt|kjadams: interesting 3S call here.|pg||
nt|kjadams: quite strong and with a side 4 card major.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i'll withdraw that comment :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder what Walsh has to do with 1@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess, bypass 4 card or longer @d suit?|pg||
nt|grebrof: they might be playing 1@d as denying 5 |pg||
nt|grebrof: 5M|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Matias...that has so long not been an alert in the states I had forgotten about it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: The normal method in DK is that 1D denies a major suit if youre not invit+|pg||
nt|pelu: nice lead - for W :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|caruga: un numerone|pg||
nt|thorvald: What would you lead ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: 2S here looks like a transfer to clubs, with 2N showing an accept of a club game invite.|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, that was the only swingy hand with the slams & games on other boards being fairly strightforward|pg||
nt|kjadams: 10 tricks for the taking with the club Q dropping.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough hand this one ... 5@C is the spot, NOT 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: *les...|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C unlucky for e/w   spade ruff|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody's 4@s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: 5@C makable only playing @CK stiff.... hard to find laso after the dbl |pg||
nt|gluckenval: also|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no miracle happens here, I suppose|pg||
nt|stoffers: The lead indicates sout to have AKQ there...|pg||
nt|stoffers: i bet he gets it right|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nunes should have played the A@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer realized 4@s is one off, but how it helps him with guessing @c right?|pg||
nt|stoffers: WQell, he doesnt know its off, because @h could be 4-2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, void in @c makes 4@s palyable, too|pg||
nt|stoffers: But he has a strong indication to play North for the exact hand now, he needs those highcardpoints to have a t/o double|pg||
nt|grebrof: I actually played a system where 2@d was transfer to all colours, except 7-9hp and 5card @h/@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: i think this was a good guess |pg||
nt|gluckenval: if South has really AKQ, North sould have the others hcp ... North vul. doesn't bid dbl with 10 hcp, better wait dbl from p |pg||
nt|hedyg: unfortunately we have no system card or CC for EW|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, so no game makes ... VERY tough hand :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Tomorrow we will start broadcasting at 14.03|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How about 4@S?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No 4@S is hopeless.  Everything is hopeless|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Their best chance is probably to get to 5@C and hope that the defence mis-steps|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  can in fact make    diamonds can be ruffed out  king an extra discard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think it can ... there aren't enough entries.  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: likel make now with no @H ruff.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: likely|pg||
nt|kjadams: The zimmerman team has been one of the top teams in the world in the last couple years.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good hand on which to get a coffee.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl at 2@h probably was penalty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good spot|pg||
nt|baldjean: W is understandibly reluctant with going to 3nt here, the @d are not that great here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gluckenval: should|pg||
nt|runnerup: east was very active (aggressive-if you want .bidding 2 @s)|pg||
nt|kjadams: The are a threat to win any event they have entered.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to decide who has the long diamonds; if north has them, you hold up since the heart finesse is into south|pg||
nt|vbman: normally most play dbls after nt opener as take out|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 3@c is 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looking for @s with partner|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, I thought so|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  I should admit, @s position appeared very unlucky for declarer - both honours offside|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, i spoke too soon|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psyck: 1...as it is his fav 20-20....2nd) as it can occasion his unfav 'f' conv by north|pg||
nt|santyclz: Only 11 top tricks. |pg||
nt|hantveit: that is a 0,25X0,68x0,53 % (plus stiff spade j)|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think 5 in spades, 4 i dia, 2 in H and one in C|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think the ACBL took it off the alert sheets in 1985|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|runnerup: no science -so that even if 2 @s are off -who guesses to lead that|pg||
nt|paulg:  they could have played in 3NT anyhow ... 3@d with @dxxx was not a great description of the hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe there are ... I'll take that back|pg||
nt|grebrof: I play Waksh myself - most bids after 1@d is GF|pg||
nt|hantveit: 1nt will quickly be 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|penseur9: fortunatly 3NT is a south lead, might have a chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, they've reached a reasonable contract, but of course Nunes was not going to lead a spade into a bid and raised suit|pg||
nt|ady: take 8 tricks cheapest|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: bravo|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: now north may shift to a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gluckenval: here we are...|pg||
nt|stoffers: very important trick coming up..|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes ofcause in good day you can meke this |pg||
nt|penseur9: with a @S return might promote a 9th... I'm a born optimist :)|pg||
nt|athene: he needs his partner to have an entry and some tricks somewhere - spades or clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, I need more caffeine!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  I'm tempting to approach the table and see Dubinin'd eyes|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|stoffers: Told you :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: wd|pg||
nt|stoffers: Wd|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh. yes!|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vbman: well  placed black kings will turn this hand into an battle|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|paulg:  my kibitzers are certain that 1@s is conventional, even if they cannot agree on the specific meaning|pg||
nt|penseur9: are we seing the right bidding here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are, they overbid a little|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: Yes...|pg||
nt|penseur9: this contract a a slight chance but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would not make either|pg||
nt|penseur9: will Fantoni lead trump here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done by Angelini to make 5@D|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he got a heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then easier, spade lead much better for the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North did not overcall in the other room, a bit strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How much does one need to overcall I wonder|pg||
nt|penseur9: I suppose that both rooms bidding can qualify as surprising... possibly strange :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni is  1 in the world, that also applies to (lack of) pace :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: he might opt for a @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=103  Fulvio Fantoni|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless Nathalie fell asleep|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's past midnight in Monaco|pg||
nt|penseur9: right and I beleive one more round to play afterwards|pg||
nt|andyv:  low @s |pg||
nt|baldjean: gives the possibiliti of showing certain other hand types, like 575 in minors. you can even show whether  you have 2-1 or 03 in majors and which one is the short suit. important if ...|pg||
nt|baldjean: you open 1nt with a 5 card major too|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ybob: with 2/2 trump = 100 % make|pg||
nt|hantveit: here, I jused made new coffee :)|pg||
nt|tez: i said for number 3|pg||
nt|penseur9: maybe enjoying a little pastis|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha, my first guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: or a coffee|pg||
nt|grebrof: S might just have played the K of @c or no?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pelu: prob @s or @h - never @CA|pg||
nt|baldjean: 5/5 in minors, I meant|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vbman: easy battle|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: and they are surely right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol  it took him 8½ minutes to find the only lead that gives the contract|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: naither 5 minutes now Roland? :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: another*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although there is still scope for declarer to go wrong of course|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: you both are LOL|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  we have four more boards to investigate the system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: who would lead a trump from Qx?|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@d merely helped declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tez: agree Paul:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this hand I would be wary of overcalling 1@s with no length in clubs and not great values|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: 200|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: diamond switch tricks 2 could have been more   but thats asking too much|pg||
nt|kjadams: several players on the zimmerman team have relocated to Monaco so we should expect that after a few years they will be representing Monaco formally in WBF events.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But no entry to table and -1.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|hantveit: east played north for Ax in dia, but would south lead low from Jtxx?|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, a @S wouldve been better - then E might not reach his @ds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzsa: I must warn everybody: this table has had technical difficulties, so if i disconnect ill try and get the table up as fast as possible!|pg||

nt|penseur9: not a good night for the Angelini team to date|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think it was very likely anyone was throwing the @CK, so he might have claimed, saved a bit of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Rødovre went to 6@c on board 2 and got a deserved 12imp lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: were back after technical difficulties. bidding on last bord was sumary|pg||
nt|vbman: ============5===========|pg||
nt|bridge_one: would need start with finesse in @C|pg||
nt|vbman: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: W is a very experienced player. He has represented Denmark in various national championships|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, good result for EW|pg||
nt|hantveit: as we mentioned on board 2, they did chose to play 4S, so imps back on that board|pg||
nt|thorvald: I agree, but as Knut Blakset says, never lead from a Jack, and on a possible 4-3 fit, looking at 3 small @Hs that looks bad to lead a heart, so forcing might be right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there must be hundreds of different methods that have been invented|pg||
nt|sybarra: same meant 3 @H for wk 5/5 majors, 3 @S strong etc |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: minor slam here for NS|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  2 pushes as for now and 2 more boards look like pushes|pg||
nt|paulg:  i also have two suggestions for nightmare, so 1@s denies four spades|pg||
nt|hantveit: the open room startet at  board 11, but they have now reached board 1|pg||
nt|grebrof: welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: Very good slam on these cards, found int he closed room.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  interesting matter od course in a close match|pg||
nt|hedyg: then1@s= no 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S can make despite the awful break in diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can ruff 3 cards even on a trump lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry wrong assessment.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: a very light 1N overcall|pg||
nt|psyck: when NS themselves are close to making 3N|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew in some trouble now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  dbl = points (penalty), pass = points as well (ready to play 1nt dbld)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  S has a nice t/o x of 1@d, doubling 1nt is more iffy.|pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 1@D in S - also when 1NT is 11-14|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: Fit jump?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: Elle avait caché un As !!!|pg||
nt|hantveit: they lead a club at the other table, but Stabile must have picked wrong card in trick 11 and 1 imp out|pg||
nt|penseur9: wow 14 IMPs for Angelini team|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fit showing jump?|pg||
nt|penseur9: can he mange the @Hs Roland?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think there's anything to manage ... he just keeps ruffing back to his hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: S may get into trouble here.|pg||
nt|vbman: and his defence was ell|pg||
nt|baldjean: the important thing is we can still show a major fit if responder is 3-0 in majors and opener has a 5 card major|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier when stiff Q of @D falls |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h by South immediately a possibility (as a splinter raise)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: works quite well here, as North would get very interested with all those controls |pg||
nt|sybarra: seems n/s may be making decisions at the 5 and 6 level here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but after 3@h it's almost impossible to find 4@s if that's the place to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: would you reopen?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will North double....|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  3@d now, good raise?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have doubled 1@d with the S hand|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha OK :)|pg||
nt|ybob: now 4@H by S ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you are allowed to correct 2@C to 2@d, that's ok....but re-opening has obvious risks|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: will Bornholm get to slam on this board?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzsa: EW convention card state that they play "natural"|pg||
nt|vbman: well thought|pg||

nt|athene: double 2@C is an alternative for north|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 3imps for One Eyed on the first board Open Room going one off in 7@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Devilish distributions here today|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D bid looks a little lazy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1N means points and no @h interest (i suppose)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AJ73 in @S correct to play Nt, but not so nice with Qx in @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2@D would be more safe|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: and we have now changed operator -- I will try to do my best |pg||
nt|vbman: 1nt 'n my opinion shows a high level of self esteem|pg||
mb|5H|nt|gluckenval: 1@S = 0-11 without 4 cards @S|pg||
nt|ady: 6th diamond becomes good after 3 ruffs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, he doesn't even need a club trick|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he thinks that should promise four spades for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and passing has obvious risks, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: that is interesting now|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|hantveit: interesting contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is (super) gazzilli for F-N?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 4@C bid may have staved off 3nt by s.|pg||
nt|ybob: lost slam now|pg||
mb|6N|nt|sfoxa:  agree. 2@d would have been better for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: bidding was in fact not like that|pg||
nt|hantveit: as we expected ns found the game |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like bidding @H's some where along the line |pg||
nt|mdgraham: depends how many diamonds a 1@d opening shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but will W pass?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, he did|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|santyclz: Other Table, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 14-17 with @c or 17+ any|pg||
nt|hedyg: but also unbalanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay, 2@H= @H+@c|pg||
nt|paulg:  fantoni-nunes play more 8- and 9-card major fits in 3NT than any other expert pairs I've seen|pg||
nt|sybarra: by south |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: the pass asked for the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: Twisted Swine type runouts after NT doubled maybe|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2 times trumph, but what if south covers the second trumph?|pg||
nt|paulg:  less advisable here of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: so Fantoni has shown minimum for his 1@H opening 5@H 4@s and refused the invite by Nunes|pg||
nt|penseur9: this one will play better... time for coffee|pg||
nt|ady: trying a@H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The one thing he better not do is draw two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nunes will "know" @HA is not cashing ... no Blackwood|pg||
nt|ady: why lead an ace then   could have been club void?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5@H and 4@c of course! sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: as we can see, no way to game now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, he had to lead something.  And neither of the singletons is at all attractive|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  looks like one down with this lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but defence has to cash its tricks now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it looks fairly easy for the defence to let 4@s make|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Rubens Hand Evaluator rates the n hand as 12.60 points:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=a108+1062+kqj754+4|pg||
nt|pelu: @C-lead kill the entry to @S-suit, but duck a @S - play for @Ss 3-3 and @hs 2-2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vbman: which is proven by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: when they do not cover ....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  with @c return, declarer will have his work easier|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|psyck: NT Runouts: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/SwineTwisted.html|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@c could have been @c & @d here if they play that style|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hantveit: maybe just play dia now, and give away that ruff|pg||
nt|mathat: if duk the @d meda 4|pg||
nt|athene: this won't play well; if the defence can get a force on west, he can say goodbye to his club suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: 3NT looks a lot better than 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: 7-2 hands rarely play well in the short suit unless partner has five-card support|pg||
nt|athene: 7-4 hands|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: It's an  old fashioned 2@d bid, but not in the last 4-5 decades.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as it happens, NS can make a diamond partial |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i think that with a passed hand you can always correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but im not sure i want to correct to my xxxxx of @d|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|tez: 4th  seat 2@h..intermediate i think|pg||
nt|kjadams: This double looks like zimmermann felt the vulnerable game bid created a forcing pass.|pg||
nt|pelu: or help in @D from NS|pg||
nt|thorvald: Its a difficult position in the bidding for north, but im not sure i would have passed that hand the entire bidding|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: it is not an obligation to play in a suit contract just because you have a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he might have drawn the conclusion that the @CA was more likely to cash, otherwise, East might have fished around for a grand slam or maybe used Exclusion Blackwood|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes.. forcing n-s to play the @D for him as cards lie:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: any thoughts about bidding 4 @C with N hand as opposed to X?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s3|nt|athene: because if you are 7-4, you are short in the other two suits and you get forced|pg||
nt|pelu: Niels K know that S is in the range for 1NT - so S i favorit to 5-4 in minor|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems better for defence now|pg||
nt|runnerup: west was active this time -ew has only 19 points and he was willing to double ns on 2-levelcan be costly |pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: @HK good shift, now it's easy to follow it up with the small heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed - certainly not obvious to re-open|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gluckenval: all in trsf for them, 1@C -> 1@D/@H = 4@H/@S, so 1@S = no 4M|pg||
nt|hantveit: going down now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hantveit: 2 club losers and 2H|pg||

nt|hantveit: or let the dia run to the ace and play another dia... |pg||
nt|paulg:  looks like NS should stop in 3@s here, but often someone bids one more|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|penseur9: 1@C or 1@D from E?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Small plusses in both rooms add up to 4 imps for Zimmerman.|pg||

nt|vugraphzsa: back in odense after some technical difficulties|pg||
nt|vbman: ===========6===========|pg||

nt|mdgraham: takes you past 3NT if that is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: silly if pd has Ax in @H and 3N is the spot|pg||
nt|ybob: i like X by N but prefer 4@H from S|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ybob: good 4@S here|pg||
nt|kjadams: others think that if NV opponents ever bid over your vul game that you have to double, but here you see the result.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: N should not have thrown his @h. Then R would have to guess whether S had @SA bare and a heart or two spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes you are all right |pg||
nt|baldjean: nice slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: another slam N/S will they get there?|pg||
nt|baldjean: this time they will|pg||
mb|5C|nt|paulg:  i guess the 2@d opener is multi 2@d, showing a weak two in either major|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d was multi showing a weak hand with a long major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = 10-13 with diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Maybe Operator should change E's name to Zia :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: board 4 was more difficolut for Multon in other Room.... the overbid was 1@D (not dbl) and the final dbl was from South....|pg||
nt|paulg:  in this case both sides might|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @D ?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @D = both majors (mostly @H )  they dont play that F ... word convention , do they?|pg||
nt|pelu: Dorthe Schaltz in N proib askinking for the bidding - looking at a solid @S-suit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hei vennnen!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry Paul :(|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  makes as they lay    fortunate contract|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hi Joe|pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: 1D = 4+/4+ same rank|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after strong club opening, NS may use their methods to pre-empt|pg||
nt|runnerup: well you cant do this in every board -otherwise youll have heart attact very soon-down 1 by uppercup|pg||
nt|paulg:  i did presume that West might show some support!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: nope|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  at least they have ones|pg||
nt|hantveit: anyway, a big lead now for Zimmermann after only 5 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  at least we agree!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: *east|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Oh wait that would give west a trick on the J|pg||
nt|baldjean: if 5@c is not invitational then S should not bid it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|santyclz2:  I wonder what the x was, majors?|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 imps per hand in average|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|athene: north might opt for notrumps over spades with that hand, even with the 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see that these two teams are tied for second|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  looks like, but what about points?|pg||
nt|paulg:  double by West is pass or correct|pg||
nt|penseur9: 1@C strong but west whit 4 points could lead to problems|pg||
nt|vbman: dint understand why s not open 1sp|pg||
nt|bridge_one: anyone know why South opened 1@C instead 1@S ?|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe he meant to open weak nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: NS do play a "natural" system|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|runnerup: some east migth open here -althougth east has a 3-suiter not suitable fos muidenberg |pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 3nt now?|pg||

nt|andreasw:  2@d both major and 0-7?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S looks like a winner - but 4x@c will defeat - impossible lead from East|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Flannery2Diamonds.html  , if you are bored|pg||
nt|pelu: 8 toptrick in 3NT - not so bad - EW can make a @h partscore|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yeah , what to bid instead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: im sure they dont have an agreement on that :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  i think I might have tried to bid my clubs|pg||
nt|tez: what do you bid with West hand?pass?2@h 3@h?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psyck: hmm, operator updated 4@s to -1|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe Zia did not cover 3rd @d or something|pg||
nt|hedyg: double was: pass if your suit is @H , else bid your suit|pg||
nt|hantveit: on board 3 we can expect imps to ns again, as it seems that ew played away 3h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat1003.html|pg||
pc|c5|nt|runnerup: they really likes to bid|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Again e has done a lot of bidding on 2 hcp.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  makeable with @c lead and guessing @h right|pg||
nt|penseur9: their are no on line results available on line unfortunatly|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Extremely weak nt non-vul.|pg||
nt|baldjean: and if it is, why does N not go to 6?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps Nunes had his moment for 2 @d -now more difficult |pg||
nt|ybob: 2Nt scrambling ?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  natural one down now|pg||
nt|kjadams: aggressive 2N will pay off here.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Optomistic bid by n.|pg||
nt|grebrof: Sonne at the other room preferred bidding the more preemptive 3@h, whicch drove NS to game |pg||
nt|hantveit: trumph lead is the best here I think?|pg||
nt|andyv:  trump lead may work best here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: this seems to be a couple down after @d finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would pass if i had no other bidding cards|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Tez, welcome|pg||
nt|athene: well, either game makes|pg||
nt|hantveit: good lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: still shoul make|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: nice prediction|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, W will have to work almost entirely out of his own hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6S, 1H, 1 and one spade ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: how to make_|pg||
nt|andyv:  he will be luck as this will make...he will win @s and play A@h and ruff @h...the K@h falls, so only 1@h loser and 2 @d losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: agreed andy|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but will Krefeld find this?|pg||
nt|andyv:  however much easier to see that from here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, that seems to be a plan, but is it the best plan?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may look at possible finesseing the @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: First  board in this session not declared by E|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, I think it's an easy plan...no preperaton required|pg||
nt|grebrof: since trumps cant be 2-2, you need Hx or HHx in @hs or the @c cut or the @d-guess right - I think here it doesnt matter as the H in @hs comes down on the ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: club finesse is working if club K onside or if JT in clubs together with 2 spades, and then guess d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: You can test @hs first right?|pg||
nt|andyv:  Finesse of @c left for last when all other plays have been exhausted|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: @s A @h to A and @h now you know what to do|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, it might be S who has the Hx/HHx in @hs, so why not|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: W should know that the @ds are no good|pg||
nt|andyv:  W must be be contemplating lunch orders|pg||
nt|hantveit: south to hold Kq in hearts are 24%|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: not with an overcall in N|pg||
nt|hantveit: the hearts to be 6-2 and Hx on one hand is much much less|pg||
nt|thorvald: Jens Ove Henneberg making the same error on B3, never supporting partner|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz2:  E-w gained 3 imps on bd four to shoot into the lead!|pg||
nt|runnerup: but like you see -no mistakes -very good lead|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought it would go 1@h (1@s) 3@h (3@s) all pass|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D has a chance now|pg||
nt|grebrof: W wants a shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: @c 8 is for sure discouraging|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: in EW methods|pg||
nt|mdgraham: heart please....|pg||
nt|ybob: good spot , E-W need @H now |pg||
nt|grebrof: @h has to be the better|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i think E is working out which H to play|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: with likely 3 minor suit losers  needs spade finesse   and luck with hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: wrong|pg||
nt|grebrof: Ns 2@s is borderline in my opinion|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  will West underlead his clubs to get a spade ruff?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes!|pg||
nt|hedyg: what else can he do?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is dummy, he can see it is his only chance |pg||
nt|vbman: this makes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 4 majors can be used 1@C (AK) to bid the @S after giving 4 cards( Kxxxx) having rest 2/2|pg||
nt|thorvald: Just need to guess spades and clubs, and have the @D king in place|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: KING!|pg||
nt|grebrof: I would think my P has worse hand than that|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, maybe it is 6-9 something in their system|pg||
nt|thorvald: No, its fine, then a rebid of 2@S can show 9-11|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|hantveit: 16,5|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @s back and you are not going to make this|pg||
nt|hantveit: so I think club to finesse first, and h to finesse later|pg||
nt|grebrof: Im too young for that - I agree, but not when nonvul :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looks like 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|baldjean: yep|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hantveit: not finish in closed yet|pg||
nt|hantveit: should we stall this table a bit maybe?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: Good shift should prevent  the overtrick.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i means 5@S with Kxxxx not so strong suit, so can bid like a 4 cards suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't understand why not ruff a @h immediately|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, that 6@C was too much for my pc :)|pg||
nt|pelu: in B1 Haderslev bid the @H-slam where decl need 4 @C-tricks on A - KQ10x - only make is Jxx in @C with 8 out|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is turning into a rout.|pg||
nt|kjadams: In theory, that finesse not safe, but declarer's assumption that they can't cash 3 spades here is right.|pg||
nt|kjadams: If east started with A63 of spades, this would now go down.|pg||

nt|pelu: Andread: East would never lead @C - so 3@S is a make|pg||
mb|5C|nt|wstuart: Easy 4@H game here|pg||
nt|ybob: EW can win 12 trick in @D |pg||
nt|hedyg: playing 3 rounds of @c on lead sure helped|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sfoxa:  wondering about the reason|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would not open 2s in south. Too strong hand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S from the small isle called Bornholm |pg||
nt|pelu: Bornholm - a small island in the Ostsee - |pg||
nt|vbman: strong but nonforcing l think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is long time i don't see a 2@S strong open|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: and here something unusual these days -- a strong 2@s opening|pg||
nt|hantveit: if partner leads a trumph, the only thing you know for sure, is that he holds no singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Krøjgaard will get there|pg||
nt|baldjean: I will take a short lunch break and will be back in a few minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 5 they sold out to 5 @D x at the other table |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Let's follow their methods. Bill will explain|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2NT GF with 4+ spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H even |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: N cannot stay out here|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: it can often be difficult for operator to get all the cards right, when they play fast or cards not seen clearly, play may have been slightly different in the 4@s -1 than shown|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW might get active and will regret finding their otherwise good @S save.|pg||
nt|hantveit: partner dos not need much before 4s is on|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a @s after taking the @c was the right move, however east deserves a prize for his imaginative defense|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally 2@S is strong, but not GF|pg||
mb|5S|nt|tomi2: seems EW play that 3M shows 5 card in the other majors to have the strong hand playing the suit contract in case there is fit|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 3@S shows 5@H GF ( not alert )|pg||
nt|tomi2: north could not bid 2@C, this would have shown both majors in their methods|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3NT here, nothing much to it really- Danger is getting to high in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  west forced to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@S = natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C = natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks pal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Happy to be of service|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure how we would cope without you|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  is that a weak two or a constructive two bid? Looks far too good for a weak 2@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is a vulnerable 2nd seat weak 2|pg||
nt|athene: this double might warn them off the doomed 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: not so much reason to double here|pg||
nt|athene: first of all, you are on lead against notrumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Is this lead enough to make the contract?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  nice smoked heerings over there :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: 2@S is a fit - jump, I think, however, West generally will have a 4th @D for this.|pg||
nt|stoffers: That 3@d bid might lead them offtrack|pg||
nt|stoffers: and it did..|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When we explain our version of Fantunes to our opps, we generally say: "our system is more natural than yours"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice bid by East - takes up a fair bit of room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: dont disturb opps if u have them where u can handle them|pg||
nt|thorvald: 4@s minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: few play FJ with 3 card supp, or may have stretched to hinder strong @c bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 1@C could be 2 cards on many weak nt hands or 0+ but then he must have 18+, thats unlikely|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs 5@d Fantoni needs to lead K@c tough|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3S or pass in my opinion|pg||
nt|santyclz: Seems like a book vulnerable weak 2 to me.  The 6/4 adds to the value but still...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But now the difficult part, cuebids, Turbo, whatever|pg||
nt|ady: so far seems very natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: agressive invit by E|pg||
nt|sybarra: was just typing,  "may just blast into it"  (6 @S and he did) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: brushed aside with some aplomb, however|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 7@C only going for 1100 unless they find the @h ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: good thing trump ace is out|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wstuart: I'm pretty insistent in my partnerships of having at least 4 of thee anchor suit (partner's suit) for a fit jump.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4H here has 2 spades and a club to lose.   Needs kx of hearts onside.|pg||
nt|athene: secondly, most people play smolen and suchlike so even if NS end in a major, you will be on lead|pg||
nt|athene: the only time it's right to get your partner to lead a diamond is when the opponents are going to end up in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: of course the problem here is that the double got them into clubs when they would have played 3nt :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  1@s = 0-11, no 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Rubens hand evaluator agrees with you.  12.55 http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=ak10972+42+7+10652|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c probably a min balanced hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s seems to be forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: they had a very strong start and a win 18-12 against the defending champions from Odense|pg||
nt|dkkello:  They are not very famous for their bridgeskiles , (until now?)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so North's hearts need only be four long  |pg||
nt|baldjean: missing game here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wstuart: It make s avery bid difference in these competitive auctions to know what the caliber of your fit(s) are.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Vs slam you dont lead the king, because partner is to overtake it...Have to lead small from Kx|pg||
nt|stoffers: Thats a free tip actually :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards very unfrienly here -so many down ,but normal try|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  click on the board you wish to review, and click âNextâ to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  may well be repeated next door|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  âOther Tableâ, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As you predicted...|pg||
nt|mathat: dbl promises @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: punishing his pd for overcalling?|pg||
nt|paulg:  east seems to have the same understanding of double to me|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5C gives up any chance of a plus score.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H is -1 and so is 5@C for NS, their best spot.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = american stayman, 2@H = 5 card suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can play seeing all cards after this auction|pg||
nt|thorvald: He had Q953 and A8 in @h, and played a @h to the ace, West dropping the Jack, now take the @D finess and play a @h to the 8|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is not the bestlooking for west -but good guess @d saves the day -and luck +guess in @c also|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is possible that East would have bid 4@h over a simple raise, but this has no real play on this layout|pg||
nt|andyv:  good point|pg||
nt|hantveit: this is a fun board|pg||
nt|ritong: it would not come as a total surprise that declarer shows his hand just after the lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: i can hear Tamburelli swearing into his beard all the way here!|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may go for 800|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: best def = 800|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tomi2: I dont think north would overcall with j6th only red so Bakkeren should get this one right|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 rounds of @hs and then @c switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: will he guess clubs?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  lack of @c cue is obvious now|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Fulvio could find it.... |pg||
nt|stoffers: They found out the @c problem in the quebidseries, but so did Fantoni i guess|pg||
nt|stoffers: The questionable bid here is 3@d, i suggest 2nt with all those soft cards. Queens and Jacks plays good in NT |pg||
nt|mathat: fantoni take the Q @c and play 3 R @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|tomi2: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are we in Turbo-land now?|pg||

nt|santyclz: "OBAR BIDS"  Oponents Bid And Raise Balance In Direct Seat"  Invented by the prolific Larry Cohen.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: With this lay out i don't think he's in trouble regardless|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, and it will happen now, low heart back|pg||
nt|thorvald: Following the principle of not leading the singleton when looking at the missing ace|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hantveit: give partner one more spade, and 4S is on. with only 8 points. and partner might have much better cards withouth investigating for 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he REALLY didnt like the lead|pg||
nt|athene: specs are asking about the 1NT - as far as i know, EW play 14-16 |pg||
nt|athene: and west sort of has 14, if you look at it sideways through a martini glass|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  16 boards in this segment. Last one segment|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of those games you don't mind missing, except when it makes  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzsa: on the boarderline of insanity :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right to anticipate @D|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: i must admit 4@H was unexpected for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pls explain 7@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: bonsoir Henri|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My guess is this|pg||
nt|ritong: last time fantoni did that, he got ruffed on the lead  perhaps he will make a remark about that displaying the dummy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 4@C confirmed 5-5 shape, and North's 4@H was as cue bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South cued 4@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: club|pg||
nt|grebrof: it should go for...|pg||
nt|hantveit: J|pg||
pc|d4|nt|penseur9: 3@D should make but possibly 3@H by E/W might have also|pg||
nt|tez: 9 imp to Levini|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North showede even key-cards with 4NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  andreaS*:) and u are right|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: DD best play now id @dQ out of hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: finito|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kjadams: down 1 in 5C is not a disaster, but 7 IMP loss for "insurance" is kind of expensive.|pg||
nt|vbman: trumps cant be33 now|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mathat: now -2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And South knew that all the key cards were there, so cued 5@D|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: apparently: 3@C min, 3@D extras & no short (that u admit), 3@H low single, 3@S middle, and 3nt high is common in Sweden.|pg||
nt|ady: 7NT better    some chances if if South did not have J@C   or if if clubs 5-0 with the present holding|pg||
nt|dkkello:  some work for declarer still|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: sh play @H8 now - only chance is to fint N with @H AJ97|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzsa: and he will pay for it :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: finesse in @H was more usefull |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North with @CQ knew where to play|pg||
nt|vbman: what makes a player 1st class is his ability to reconstruct hands \ and to have the courage to go along |pg||
pc|sK|nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|santyclz: It doesn't really matter what s guesses here.  Zimmermann did very well to avoid overbidding.|pg||
nt|thorvald: Really nothing that should tell him to not guess the @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: agree|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  playing @c10, W may indicate for partner, that he has one more trick in this suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thus, E can duck @s lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not now, supposingly|pg||
nt|hantveit: club q, dia A and c|pg||

nt|vugraphzsa: (explanations from the table)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: why is South interested in slam opposite a passed hand? |pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  the auction was fine if 3@d was invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: rightaly so, in my opuinion|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: the bridge isn.t chess - in the transnational play Fantoni -Nunes and Meckstroth- Rodwell - but they don't win ... and also Zia, Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree with Matias - I bid 3red as inv and 3@c as gf in situations like that|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would not invite with 8 points an ace and a 5 card suit :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: double here shows exactly 4 spades, NS changed that agreement and changed back :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 more imps in play in this board|pg||
nt|vbman: normal stayman will come l think|pg||
nt|baldjean: rightly*|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|runnerup: 2 top loosers in @d and north bid that suit -still not lead -can cost 2 imps|pg||
nt|dkkello:  bornholm is leading (the event now) course the aggresive slam bid on board 4|pg||
nt|thorvald: 4-card @s and a nice minor if partner scrambles in 2NT|pg||
nt|baldjean: because of the 2nt bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: passing if you think that there are some irregularities is actually much better - the judges will adjust to what the rules say is fair anyway|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  They right-sised it in the other room, didn't get the @d lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Sigh!|pg||

nt|pelu: very passive by S 5 trumps and good singleton|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @S i like|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzsa: dbl was not alerted. looks like a misunderstanding EW|pg||
nt|grebrof: and why is N cuebidding @S when S failed to bid anything else than 4@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsa: 7th trick given away on the lead (3rd 5th)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  wonder what he think his partner have ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4-4 heart fit will be found by game can't be make|pg||
nt|grebrof: your 5 cardsuit could have been better :D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: give S the 10 of D i wouldn't either|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s a busy bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: that contract is both, unlucky and wrongsided|pg||
nt|gluckenval: lead in the partner's suit is a jolly good idea :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (sided)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: N says he doesn't remember if its 4+ or 5+ @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  even 3@h is too high (3@s losers and 2@h losers)|pg||

nt|andyv:  along with a @d|pg||
nt|ritong: @dKxxx, ok, but the rest..|pg||

nt|vbman: l off course have respect for loosing ' just how this was reacted?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|grebrof: well, well|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: because his 5th trump is gold opposite a @c suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let's just say that NS were reaching for the moon a bit|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: (which S is likely to have)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: true|pg||
nt|grebrof: I once experienced twice in 28 boards that both us and our opps got a 0 - had my P not dbl, we would have won the event|pg||
pc|s5|nt|runnerup: 3 @h can be down with @s ruff -3 @d -or 3nt -as looks here has no luck / south -maybe by north -@h lead|pg||

nt|bridge_one: because happen |pg||
nt|bridge_one: not bad performance|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wstuart: 1NT is reasonable with the west hand.  Either passing or 1NT could win.|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately not the best this particular hand|pg||
nt|wstuart: Those of you who are thinking about 2@C, however, need to rethink;  that would be a clear error.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, should have 6 decent cards for 2@c|pg||
nt|ritong: fantoni is praying now|pg||
nt|ritong: he s on lead vs NTs|pg||
nt|jacksond: hearts agreed|pg||
nt|runnerup: but looks that west is only asking-so should know to bid 4 @h|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A lesson here about the value of x'ing artificial bids.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  We've all seen x's on these auctions even by the person who will be on lead.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the worst thing that may happen - EW will play 6@h from E hand and S, hearing partner didn't double 2 @d bids, will lead NOT diamond|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  sorry, no|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sorry, private.  Does anyone know about the 3/4th place match?|pg||
nt|runnerup: just have to guess if they have agreedeed this till the end -at least some thinking progressing|pg||

pc|d2|nt|psyck: but will lose imps with the result here|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  They don't believe in lead-directing x's.  Partner is supposed to work it out.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: declarer losing trump control now|pg||
nt|stoffers: Will strugle here, 6 or 7 tricks. @h up then spade best|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: 10 board matches, next one in about 20 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i'll try and try till this works|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, but you must bid 3H on souths hand. from this bidding we can determine that ns is not using 21|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think there is any game NS. 4@h has two aces and two trumps to lose|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|gluckenval: no entries|pg||
nt|stoffers: @d promotes now|pg||
nt|stoffers: If he plays spade now, declearer can play small club in the ending getting a free finesse|pg||
nt|stoffers: So, @d is best|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gluckenval: Alex found it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, 2 imps go to NS|pg||

nt|baldjean: brb|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|runnerup: ok -at least not vulnerable -so cheaper|pg||
nt|pelu: only friend of Andreas and Kello are here - in total 30 - and over 700 in OR - and still no commentator :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|runnerup: wrigth tears of sweat to Nunes|pg||
nt|ritong: fine shot by nunes  worth 2 imps|pg||
nt|dkkello:  lol|pg||
nt|grebrof: leading the openers major holding Jx is a lucky punch at best|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psyck: you can see the team members in the links posted by Wayne above, but we do not have results of other matches at present|pg||
nt|stoffers: Well done|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next,please!|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Personally, I need all the help I can get on leads.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|thorvald: I would bid 2 @s after 2@H, and even think that North should pass3 @C - and after 3@S I think South should bid the game|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|andyv:  maybe...the weak @hs, make this more a 9 point hand than an 10|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: and the game is belove 50% nv (after 1Nt in E u need @CA in West|pg||

nt|dkkello:  Nielsen-Andersen doing well|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this should be a flat board.. partscore in @h for n-s at both table i would think|pg||
nt|vbman: =============10================|pg||
nt|hantveit: 9 losers, so that also indicates no game, but 2H might be stronger, but not strong enough for 3H so I would never pass on south|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6: in open is taking time... :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm sure there is a study somewhere in the bridge world that would support your position or mine:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: 1@S and 2@C looked ok :-)|pg||
nt|pelu: ok: 1Nt - P - 2@H (to play) and 3@C by N?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the lead suggested E had nothing, so tryng to score 4@h tricks must have been better|pg||
nt|grebrof: but as our operator said-  its been a long day for the players|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: The ruling on board 7 was that N/S play 5@sX +1 -1050 and E/W play 5@dX -1|pg||
nt|grebrof: are there ONLY 4men/women teams in this event?|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok, so 13 imps for BK 1936|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 5@D undoubled obv|pg||
nt|grebrof: I mean 4 persons most at every team|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  But good with some action .. watching Meckwell and all the other, congrats netherland, this is "normal life"   ;)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Zmud99: We have some technical problems - we will resume at board 11 |pg||
nt|stoffers: Multon didnt lead partners suit last board, for the cost of 5 imps|pg||
nt|runnerup: no game here either -but 3nt looks starnge versus 4 @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@S seam ON played by West|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 8  where 6 @D at this table,  they played 3 @D at the other table |pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice barrage|pg||
nt|baldjean: slam in @d here. @c slam will go down|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|wstuart: Ah, life in the strong @C lane.  Since south is limited to about 16 HCP, he can sytemically open lighter.|pg||
nt|hantveit: lol, yes... pls send it too us :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  zzzzzzzzzzz|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@S aggressive (but i agree with this layout)|pg||
nt|vbman: 3sp  looks ok to me|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|dkkello:  Peter might bid on|pg||
nt|vbman: good royals and trumps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: no quacks|pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: it happens... frequently|pg||
nt|stoffers: Whats the range of 3@h?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, both 3nt and 4@h are down, but heart game looks natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Will N/S win the battle over West on this board?|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 3NTX? where only a @C lead could defeat 3@S - N (Haderslecv) in 2@Sx !|pg||
nt|vbman: we play this 3sp show 5431|pg||
nt|vbman: so dia or h single|pg||
nt|mdgraham: old story - off in a slam, opps not even in game|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  though, declarer still has a lot of problem|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no entry to the hand for @h finess|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 solid loosers|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and playing @h from top may help another day, but now it leads to down 2 and one more push|pg||
nt|ritong: and more|pg||
nt|ritong: he knows that east did not underlead @c K|pg||
nt|ritong: dummy's suit|pg||
nt|ritong: so, chances of a singleton are close to 100%|pg||
nt|ritong: except if east has all the remùaining high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: but he passed first|pg||
nt|ritong: so, nhe bnecessarily has a "neutral" lead elsewhere|pg||
nt|ritong: hence, @c = singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: now, perhaps it is right to give @c K immediately|pg||
nt|ritong: in order to limit loss to one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: EW play that K asks for count and W therefore lead the Q asking for attitude|pg||
nt|andyv:  strange 3N bid by N|pg||
nt|hantveit: if 21 then the bidding would go 1s-1nt-2h, but if you use the modern biding it might go|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
nt|mdgraham: team-mates unimpressed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you wonder where did I go wrong???  LOL |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  even this way leads to 2 down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all up to East|pg||
nt|baldjean: now opponents will have to find the @d ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: East's DBL was responsive, showing values and some of the other suits.  |pg||
nt|runnerup: Welland -team has now got 2 swings -that partial -3 @d here and spades in 10 -otherway other room and where you had 12 in @d by good guesses -5 @d +1 -so White house needs some ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: good |pg||
nt|ybob: hard to defeat , only @D now and later if Q@H duck by S|pg||
nt|ritong: since it is REALLY uneasy to give up that early, it takes ages|pg||
nt|dkkello:  how many trick Peter?|pg||
nt|pelu: in CC= 2@S weak - not the hand we havce on screen here :) looks like a contructic 10-13 opening :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: 1s-1n-2d!-2h=support but not max|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: There are some fancy methods here which I bet EW are playing where 2NT byt the t/o DBLer shows exactly 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: This tournament is the longest single weekend tournament in DK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  3@s, sorry|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|runnerup: defenders has 4 all the time so -i would say difficult to make with only 1 entry to table|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  spade back, as indicated, and push in the board|pg||
nt|dkkello:  are you watching at the "enemy" table ;)|pg||
nt|vbman: west is right to stay away from game with this hand|pg||
nt|baldjean: "I had a gut feeling, partner". "Yeah, and you produced crap"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|baldjean: no|pg||

nt|grebrof: rarely I call my P stupid - other than those who need to hear it to play well :)|pg||
nt|ritong: rare bird|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|wstuart: 3@H shows 5@H, 2NT shows 4@H and 3m is usually a 5 card suit (with 3@H).|pg||

nt|pelu: prob making 10 tricks - and 7 IMP back to Hornbæk|pg||

nt|pelu: N has the distribution to bid - not S|pg||
nt|thorvald: 5@D is makeable Double Dummy, but hard to make after an opening in South|pg||
nt|pelu: 1 - 2 break downs in CR - in almost every match - OR work fine - not to blame u Matias - some sh try to chance the internet-cabel|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dkkello:  also Odense at other table went down in a slam coming up soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: not the best slam|pg||
nt|baldjean: how did N/S get to 6nt at the other table?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|thorvald: OR was down 10 mins ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a lot of 4-4-4-1 hands this set|pg||
nt|mdgraham: were in 6@d at one point - which is a decent enopugh spot|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzsa: This could lead EW to slam|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 more boards must be like 18-12 right now for Bornholm small svings important in this event|pg||
nt|dkkello:  no!!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Haderslev will not bid it ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: hearts not frienly here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|stoffers: 3@h an slight overbid with 4333 and 8Hcp if it is supposed to show 9-11|pg||
nt|baldjean: exchange 10@h with the 2 or 6, and 4@s would make here|pg||
nt|baldjean: looks like a forcing pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather....|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: Double showing @D and some tolerance for @Cs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|stoffers: 3@c is 6+ cards and invitational here|pg||
nt|andyv:  on last board, itwould seem that 9 tricks were easy...I must have missed something|pg||
nt|hantveit: looks like ew are playing weak 1nt openings|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Another failing close game.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3nt look better than 4@h, if you are going to play the game|pg||
nt|dkkello:  those guys are hot!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: they play round robin 11 x 12 boards - no Knock-out|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsa: look at the lay out in @s.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vbman: l find last pass too conservative|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: this a particularly light 1@h, for them|pg||
nt|ritong: but nunes could not stand 1NT opening|pg||
nt|vbman: if they bid two nt  u achieved your goal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Nice lead!. now 2X@d and then @c|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  this lead brouth a shadow of hope to declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: for those among you who discover fantunes, they have revolutionary ideas about openings|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  2nd time this round Nunes has opened an 11 hcp 1 of a major - have they changed their system?|pg||
nt|ritong: 1 any is forcing, for them|pg||
nt|runnerup: this it not down yet -althougth-looks very difficult to make|pg||
nt|pelu: same start in OR - In OR 1@S = unballanced hand promise 5 card @c|pg||
nt|dkkello:  4 NT perhaps|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure they will play 4@h|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: they don t|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@h, I meant of course|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||

nt|ritong: soo..|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that it matters much here, but leading a small dblton in opps suit when you hold QJT98 is very weired for me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  ah, the @h shift...never mind|pg||
nt|hantveit: sory andy, but I did not follow lasthand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 2 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 1 h|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 5 d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: thats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E had 8 tricks but not a 9th and compressed it to 7|pg||
nt|hantveit: west needs to ruff at least one spade on this board|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: so, with hearts breaking, and spade AK in front, there should be no issue|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should have plenty of time for that|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looks like 10+ tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  if declarer cashes 3@d tricks, 3@s tricks and will discover the situation in @h|pg||
nt|runnerup: he'll see that soon|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tiny game|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, if he finds a winning solution, gromov will say " wd me, didn t double"|pg||
nt|andreasw:  with the results e-w has in the last 4 boards the match is problebly their'es|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, kello - East sh bid 3NT, but she gave up the slam|pg||
nt|dkkello:  In Haderslev you can cross the boarder to germany and buy cheap beers and wine E-W havent done that today|pg||
nt|pelu: 4NT|pg||
nt|vbman: but if they found a suit maybe u corrected them|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, cannot really see how this can go wrong, often 11|pg||

pc|c4|nt|santyclz2:  I'm told that 1@h only shows 11+ if 5+@hs and 4 @ss.  |pg||
nt|hobakan: he will think 8 minutes more this trick:)|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 5/0 split is a shock|pg||
nt|ritong: but it will probably simplify matters|pg||
pc|cK|nt|calabres: .|pg||
nt|ritong: north is in trouble|pg||
nt|ritong: for starters, @h position is far from clear|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vbman: spoiled the defence|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|ritong: since, now that this atrocious break is disclosed, he has to sail any piece of tissu|pg||
nt|hantveit: west was afraid ofcourse of single dia|pg||
nt|baldjean: declarer will at first have regretted not to be inj grand, but after the first roun of @d was relieved|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pelu: against strong NT (as here) I play D = 5minor+4major - and Ew could bid 4@s (down 300)|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||

nt|thorvald: Looks like we will have a new team in the lead of this tournament, as a victory to Århus with 17+ Imp will move them ahead. Aakirkeby still have the possibility to take the lead to ...|pg||
nt|thorvald: then|pg||
pc|s5|nt|runnerup: yes and good thing is it is east not west with 7 on @h -5-0 other way -no chance at all perhaps|pg||

nt|vugraphzsa: Why not end the session with a slam board|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: S didn't play the cards and claimed 11 without noticing the spade situation|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a convention more and more player are using|pg||
nt|dkkello:  NS likely to play 4@H or 3NT her - both making|pg||
nt|dkkello:  normally , the best player of them all imo|pg||
nt|pelu: creativ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: swingy? :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes , thx peter|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and mathias|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Matias for an excellent job guiding us thru here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: thank you to all commentators|pg||
nt|andyv:  and thank you Trond for you fine commentary and of course to all the specs for joining us.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: we will be back after a short break (i think) :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  not me...of to bed:)|pg||
nt|pelu: in the next match u will hve voice commentating in Open room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big one to finish!|pg||
nt|sybarra: great result in the other room |pg||
nt|ritong: always a problem when there is a void  let s see|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Well bid by the Schaltz couple efter 3@S  4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Perhaps East should have bid more than 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@Sx looks like 1400|pg||
nt|grebrof: takk for meg forresten - det er festlig å se på :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: he should have known East was squeezed if playing the last trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: or he should have played the @h10 to the Q|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzsa: Brave 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or 16 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 12|pg||
nt|vbman: 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ty|pg||
nt|thorvald: 1@S as in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i would not open this hand with 1S i think|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Vest only bid 3 @S in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting auction in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2N minors (i suppose)|pg||
nt|vbman: minors l think|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  here is a chance for Odensen , but..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: there was a late alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: nobody asked about 2n|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: now W asked and answer was unsure, but minors|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5nt is a 11p nid anyway|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s makes things difficult|pg||
mb|d|nt|dkkello:  will make it 4 @H now|pg||
nt|pelu: Last board - we will be back in 20 min - tx to kibs and to Mathias our operator who had a hard start on this match - wd|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: rebid 2@c or 2@s?|pg||
nt|grebrof: nid=bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: where do you start with the S hand (at the table)?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: i don t get his line  no matter   next|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will compete to the 5 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H or double |pg||
mb|2S|nt|runnerup: a littel overbid by ns in the other room -so how is it here?|pg||
nt|ritong: 5NT a nice creation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: against double - 5 catd major and no clubs to lead if partner passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: I thought north might make a mixed raise (constr values with 4 trump) by bidding 3@D rather than 2@D.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|stoffers: 3@s loosers and nothing more here|pg||
nt|stoffers: Maybe even 2, but will get tapped on that lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS got a chance to avoid the game after this start|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may get a crack at 4@S|pg||
nt|baldjean: squeeze is more elegant :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Maybe he evaluated his hand to be too good for 3@D.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d now?|pg||
nt|thorvald: South need to bid now|pg||
nt|ritong: now @d + @hs is disclosed|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz2:  The auction at the other table got out of hand when e overcalled 2@h and s bid 3@cs.|pg||
nt|pelu: ok - but board 1 - was a very bad slam = +11, and 6@C - better that the 6@H cost 10 - 42 IMPs on 2 slams|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 now?|pg||
nt|ritong: but too tough, understandably|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not easy |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 6@s here will bring them to 7@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't see how South can bid on - North hasn't shown anything|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Yes because South will pass|pg||
nt|frm: Måske lidt hjælp nu (6 SP)|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  If East bids 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  trouble now , no! :)|pg||
nt|vbman: well  not my choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: not mine either|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with void in @S i agree with 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  very ugly multi in imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Theres a lot of MAN in this match!|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: was a chance to get 8+ in but now hmm|pg||
nt|hantveit: dangerous while north failed to support with support|pg||
nt|andyv:  the vul is preventing S from bidding...if that is the case, S might have been better off to bid 2@d first and then @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: if east tries 6@s, he cimmits himself to 7|pg||
nt|grebrof: if E bids 6@s now, I think its a little too late|pg||
nt|sybarra: bummer |pg||
nt|ritong: commits*|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe North will, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: true|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: 5@C??????? pd is 6-9 - try to make a miracle :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Just trying to keep NS out, was unlucky with the 4 @cs in north - "knowing" NS had 4@h standing|pg||
nt|fjog: S should raise after p´s 6 club|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gluckenval: ok, 3|pg||
nt|stoffers: might play @c now, thats the safest option|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe that is a point|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, south is very strong, he is in red, but still stronger then partner wold believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: weird lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the explaination for 3@c does not coincide with the W hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Ty all we will soon be back|pg||
nt|grebrof: great auction at the other table and this was not so bad either - N didnt have to have any entry for @h cut - which might not even be on|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty all |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Technical problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i will just claim when the play is over|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: ty all for watching|pg||
mc|9|nt|andreasw:  they lost... who figured?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  maybe peter find a way to 9 tricks ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I cant .. seeing all cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Looks very hard on this lay out|pg||
nt|pelu: as I see: no play for 3NT - both majors bad for declarer|pg||
nt|dkkello:  maybe more than 1 down?  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: If someone can find a way Peter is the one! :)|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR: the lead: @S10 from West???|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but E-W bidding on B6 will take some explanation during the comparison|pg||
nt|grebrof: agree - dont need much in @ds from P here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: forcing with @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  they must lead low from xx..that has become more popular last 10 years|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: of course|pg||
pg||
