nt|kit: Does the score here reflect the adjustment?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: the score on BBO is without the director's ruling|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: so it actually is 215-291, but i don't know whether the appeal has changed it back|pg||
nt|kit: Lall and Grue are very creative, so we should see some interesting actions|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 2@H EW can just be made same as 2nt|pg||
nt|kit: I'm surprised in closed room that E-W didn't pounce on 2@C, particularly at the state of the match.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yes 3nt can be made (but who will bid that:)?|pg||

nt|ady: not clear cut for north to go as far as 4@H|pg||

nt|ady: weak 2 from South?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is the ONLY weak 2 available to NS  but will he try??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@S  if 2nd suit, it is LONGER|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H a make for n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs checking what Bathurst had last hand|pg||
nt|calabres: .|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5-10 HCP, 6+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak 2 that might make some shudder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at these colors could be 5@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just the opposite of standard carding|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 0+@D  but never fewer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6-6- west  though   can be highly contested|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of 1@C rather than 1@D    system must dictate the opener with 44 minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N relay|pg||
nt|ady: needs an ear;y club attack to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall DBL = Responsive   i.e. takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|rhelle: 2@d is very aggrassive, even by De Wijs's standards|pg||
nt|roswolf: no half measures for west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@H, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: don't try this at home :)|pg||
nt|ady: USA 3 imps on hand 1   4@C -1   and 2nd board could be ok for USA as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=0-2@S, <FG,  NF   F1 unless 5332|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so PASS=5@S(332)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = min, unbal |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Ultimate Canape   where 2-suited hands open the SHORTER suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: so  i don't know what vP was doing :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think vP was supposed to bid 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: would not some type of raise in spades be sounder here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not much on here    e/w have the balance and a spade fit    but tje 2 level in jeorpardy|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: when the players came in the room, the discussion between Zagorin and de Wijs was about the banana of Zagorin, if de WIjs will get the last or the first bite :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen can locate shortness or signoff in 3/4@S|pg||
mb|p|an|not 4!S 5+!C/!D|nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought  deWijs might [keyword] bid 3@S to confirm 4-fit, but  doesn't like @CK or red suit holdings|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: traffic lights say go :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: it does seem to have worked, after a fashion|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: hi all|pg||
nt|barbyh: good stop|pg||
nt|ady: restraint from North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the NS responses to 2N are unlike any I've seen from other pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = offer to play opposite the weak NT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphznt: Sjoert when he puts dummy now, tja... hands you have to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink: Sorry...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: steps to show  min/max  unbal/bal|pg||
nt|ady: out of their depth|pg||
nt|sybarra: so Al,  with 5/5 max South would bid again over 1 nt? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room delays start of play so that live vugraph has scores for comparisons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: would he rebid spades or diamonds first? |pg||
pc|sK|nt|rhelle: since declarer has 4 sure losers; 2 in each major, the double @c finesse will have to work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  carding  upside-down count & attitude  odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spot card leads vs NT = Attitude|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to go down 3 at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  Muller saying  he has suit worth continuing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the EW contract proves     sometimes preempts work|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: could make 4 |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: yes more american imps likely|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: this has its difficulties|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in udca  @S4 is ENCOURAGING|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst checking if EW play 2nd/4th through declarer, and rest of signals|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: could be duplicated    unless a sacrifice at the 5 level with n/s cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry folks comment to a spec re previous bd|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rhelle: and lo and behold ... today, it does :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of questions re the pass of 1 nt by N on first board,  anyone have any insights? |pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I do|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 - 15. North has 10, with a 3343|pg||
nt|roswolf: it does show that everyone is watching carefully:)|pg||
nt|harmon: only chance to beat this is with swindle win 1st dwith ace|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|rhelle: so a max of 25, and the risk of going off in 2NT for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx that should settle the cannibals down|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd pass that hand as well|pg||
nt|ady: Netherland may lose around 6 on hand 17  where they stopped in 1NT  with 25hcp|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up club suit for 1 loser playing west for 1 high hnor and 10   doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and indeed they do lead 2nd/4th thru declarer|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: 1@S-2@S = 4-fit   1@S-2@D=art invite maybe 3-fit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: spades also become good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are very few auctions where we have same inferences that are available to NS sequences|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bermuda Bowl and Transnational Teams are playing the same set of boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1@D is only opener that can have 2nd suit that is shorter   5@D 4@C|pg||
nt|projekt1: y|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: can still make 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right,   in known long suit   @H2 also carries suit preference for @C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: and heart position favourable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must guess if this is @C position or deWijs @CKQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way  Muller figures to hold @HA|pg||
nt|ady: will not need to pin the 10C!  in west hand   rather than play for KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: no club played|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW finished set 5 of 8 very late   does anyone know if there were any time penalties?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: well that removes all doubt|pg||
nt|eweber: der andere ist, dass du z.B. von AQ109 hinter dem J vom Dummy die technisch richtige Karte spielst du Partner weiß, dass du das Ass noch hast (und nicht der AS), von der Sorte ...|pg||
nt|eweber: Haltungen gibt es einige|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: has to ruff a spade  so not only needs the J@H with west   but 3-3 split   which it is|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: on 18  Grue in 4@H|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: you cannot though enjoy the sspades as that means drawing 2 more trumps   and that will lead to down 1|pg||

nt|ady: not much on for anyone  here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is weaker way to raise   2@H would be better|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||

nt|ahollan1: original tarzan was buster crabbe|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very practical bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: after all that 4@H seems far too boring|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   likely stopping place|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 4@S looks to be better contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since no transportation |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @H stoppers going away very soon|pg||
nt|ady: hard to make     bad communications    K@C   looks best shot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe try  win @H, @S to Ace, @C finesse hoping for Qx in west??|pg||
nt|mathat: mow make if take the 2nd @h and play K @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall's 3N confirms that the transfer was Invitational or better|pg||
nt|ady: which lead    spade down    heart making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees just has too much offense with 5@D  to pass 3@CX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i thought he would try 3N too Bob|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: verhees: Sorry when he put dummy down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: 6@C  good contract   but fails on bad trump split|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you look at the NS hands of board 17 in isolation, and you'd give a score in a bidding competition, you score 10 for 1NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c: you have a sure @d loser, and a 2nd @s loser if the @dA is wrong. So not so great ...|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands done well to keep out of alsm|pg||
nt|rhelle: and that is only if the @sK is right|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 9 tricks in spades with their combined 16 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: got it right|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer can throw @SK on the Ace|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: vP DBL could include strong NT   so  Verhees DBL instead of @H |pg||
nt|bobholl: but only if it is wrong :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ady: dont think K@C good enough if west refuses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so many hands that make 3@H will also make 3N  and the latter pays a bonus!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: on bd 2 team america in 6@C i am told|pg||
nt|xenya: making|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think my bizarre line also works if West singleton @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  18   2@H-4@H   yawn|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: on previous board  in Transnational Teams  the Israel Junior pair played 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: brilliancy missed :(|pg||
nt|ady: good point   drop K@S  under the king    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and play for @CK onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2  4@H East  made 2 overtricks    11 imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if play @D and South ducks, Lall will overtake|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: thought he might duck in both hands |pg||
nt|rhelle: Of course, 6@c looks good even when the @sK is offside - if the @d A is onside|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rhelle: but on a @s lead, it gets decidedly less good|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: now all over |pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: problems|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rhelle: now declarer has some problems, and needs to start looking for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: now what ?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd say, start by setting up a 2nd @s trick and advance the @s J|pg||
nt|ady: K@D best chance  |pg||
nt|ady: I think needs an error in defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: East has to duck, otherwise you have another entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ady: J@S   east can just win and return a heart  and no problem then for defence|pg||
nt|ady: does not have to duck   just clear hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: many ways home from here|pg||
nt|rhelle: I hear various lines of play from the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|rhelle: To be honest, I'm not sure about any of them|pg||
nt|sybarra: but so much easier from this vantage point, dont you think?|pg||
nt|ady: wests play of 10@H  seems odd    maybe a view graph error|pg||
nt|rhelle: Declarer has noted the @h discard on the 1st @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no error, W started @H 10...|pg||
nt|ady: well seems to be an error in defence  10@H lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: Where are the points? the 3rd hand 1@h doesn't promise the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Muller thinking of every possible distribution,  knowing the @C and (maybe) hts|pg||
nt|frankaus: even from  up here the way forward is not clear|pg||
nt|frankaus: all the kibs and gib make it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller is trying to work out why East played @H9 at Trick 1. With QJ98x, East would overtake @H10, in case it was a singleton.|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer seems to have 9 tricks; 3@c, 2@d, 2@h, 2@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: but how to get them before the defence has 5?|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome petergill|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Peter |pg||
nt|ady: needed diamond lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: other room   19 also 3@C south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't see that  line coming|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|petergill: Hi. The defence makes no sense to South. That's why Bauke Muller, normally slow and thoughtful, is even mroe slow and thoughtful now |pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: hang on   didn't wooldridge need to duck?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 4@C 2@H 2@S 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: win @CA was wrong because it was entry to @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course -- vP didn't reveal shape on this auction|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fluffy: Patrick, here is Justin's quote on fatigue: http://www.bridgebase.com/forums/topic/48808-bermuda-bowl-chit-chat/page__view__findpost__p__584232|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge who is very active opening at 1 level  does not go wild with preempts   so he passed the south hand on  3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: West's @HQ lead fooled everyone|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: he led @H 10 |pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphznt: NS claimed|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF  vP believes Hurd's signals   @D4 @D3  says  I don't like @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he guesses correctly|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: this is 4th of 8 16-board segements   5&6 played later today  7&8 tomorrow|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: here comes the end play|pg||
nt|rhelle: surely East will unblock the @dJ when the Q is played|pg||
nt|ady: needs to unblock   is experience enough to kmow|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he have the @D spots for that?|pg||
nt|rhelle: but it won't help, as then when West wins the trick, he can't play @h|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Joel Wooldridge's thinking with Q10 doubleton was that if partner has @HJ, leading the ten makes little difference to lead the ten, and if S has @HJ, then @HQ will score an ...|pg||
nt|petergill: unexpected trick over the jack later|pg||
nt|rhelle: so declarer's 4th @d will then become the winning 9th|pg||
nt|ady: but long diamond now good|pg||
nt|sybarra: so will play q of @D and @d |pg||
nt|rhelle: very likely. East is void in @c, so very unlikely the @sK is now singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: ducking a @d now looks safe enough, but S is checking if endplays are possible on other layouts|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c7|nt|petergill: unblock the jack was only chance on @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now endplay dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: now endply East for @S trick|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rhelle: now that East doesn't unblock, exiting with a @h looks safe|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: sorry   i missed the good @H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: dummy squeezed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: first     then endyplay|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: unblcok was best    might have exited with a heart|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 20: When @D8 won, West might have inferred that South had all the @d's higher than that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D relay but not promising any points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: disagree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue Lall will probably have Big Club auction to 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D still 0+|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rhelle: and a useful 13 IMPs reward|pg||
nt|sybarra: wk raise (preemptive)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=@D, 10-15 HCP  [2@D<2@H<2@S]|pg||
nt|ady: or A@S lead and diamond switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS=6-8 HCP|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: @DJ had to be played smoothly, in totally normal tempo under @DQ, to try to convince S it was E's last @D. That's the only way 3NT might have gone down|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am tols on bd2 america likely to make 6@C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks Gerbrand  i feel better now :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that covers hand with 5+@S|pg||
nt|ady: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no worries   vP will bid @S|pg||
nt|ady: there should be a way to catch this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D can have longer @C/@S, but NOT longer @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually less than game force|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@C=LONGER @C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rhelle: I can't see East bid. 3@s was bid under pressure|pg||
nt|roswolf: A TRUE CANAPE OPENING|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-13|pg||
nt|ady: ok   this time they could escape|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  Zagorin in 4@S   2@S-4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@S was mildly conservative, after S's weak raise. 4@S was possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try 5@C which will discourage Bathurst from bidding more|pg||
nt|ady: sorry folks  have connection problems|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is easy, and 5@D looks OK, but if N doubled 3@C (t/o) to try to get to 3NT, S might pass and 3@CX would be cheap save|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: it did and anothe 13 imps to team america as i predicted:)|pg||
nt|ady: last hand bad for USA   3 hearts could have been beaten and 3@S making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  invert the PASS/DBL from the way most Big Clubbers bid over interference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good point from Hedy on Voice Commentary    deWijs upgraded his hand from 1N=good 12-15|pg||
nt|bobholl: on @S lead it goes down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: very controlled auction |pg||
nt|ady: but now it looks n/s may get too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still time to shift|pg||
nt|bobholl: or switch :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  Puppet 2@D   a) to play 2@D  b) some invitation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must admit i wouldn't do that with 4333 and no fillers|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: Have to pick @SQ (unlikely but not impossible) to make 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  Grue also in 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: In 2@D, Joe Grue will not go -4, more like -200, I predict|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's part of  2-Way Checkback   aka  2-Way NMF   aka XYZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW obviously discussed this auction   with  2N showing minors|pg||
nt|chick: hard to imagine anyone leading anything except a diamond honor, but he can still switch to spade later, if he gets the diamond count right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rhelle: the 3@h bid proved very effective in stopping EW reach their cold game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but XYZ applies in other sequences that don't end in 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember opener only promised 4@C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: 4@S   good contract    case for west to try 4@S    though cant say automatice|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2nt is realy to clubs|pg||
nt|barbyh: relay|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Other room also in spade partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: West could have played @SJ instead of the third @d, to escape for -200, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue in same end position in 2@D  so -400 probably a push|pg||
nt|petergill: with trumps 4-1, declarer will need absolutely inspired play to make this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller thinks there was a break in tempo |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and asked for a director|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North didn't see it|pg||
nt|petergill: Easy for us with all 52 cards visible, but almost impossible to make 6@D looking at 26 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: before the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinks it was the fastest bid he made in the auction..|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20 was pushed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst leaves to the toilet now|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   alert 10-15 pts   4+ diamonds??|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North alerted it like that|pg||
nt|ady: may not be good news when he returns|pg||
nt|petergill: We all saw for ourselves how long it took for S's 5@D - though if we were all polled, we would estimate different amounts of seconds - such is the nature of human memory.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: not the dummy I Hoped|pg||
nt|ady: so some sort of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S denied @H control  so Zagorin 5@C not only shows the @C void but ALSO @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Think south decided to show his hand like this..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I couldn't read SW explanation|pg||
nt|petergill: If S did have a 4th @D, then 6@D would be a decent contract. |pg||
nt|rhelle: so, single dummy, how to play this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver start with 1@D [usually 5+]  -  2@C Relay, INV+|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 top tricks. Where to find 3 more, and lose only 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin doesn't know how to play yet, according to his body language|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither do we|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe take the ace, @h to the 9?|pg||
nt|rhelle: aiming to ruff 2 @h in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe he has a chance. Does the 3@C overcall suggest @SQ? More importantly, if East turns up with 4 @D's and 3 @hs when KQ drop and obv only 2 @C's then @SQxxx onside cannot be ...|pg||
nt|petergill: picked up for 4 tricks so the only hope might be Qx doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to think of the hand as if you were at the table and DO NOT know @SQ falling doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was lebensohl or  good/bad???|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  [1N-2]    Grue in 2@H North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try to give Verhees @D ruff now??|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they gave count he won't |pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla:  great article on 4-5 minors openings: http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  3 Wooldridge in 3@HSouth|pg||
nt|ady: cannot afford the 9@D|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile on 2, the Dutch declarer in OR took 12 tricks in 4@H, making it a 4-ttrick difference -- quite impressive|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle: this switch does not paralyse declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: attempt to ruff 2 hearts  which as it happens wont be neccessary  and bank on spade finesse   4th spade discarded on club|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you ruff 2@h in dummy, you only need the @s finesse|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphznt: Drijver asked if they do it often bid 1NT with a 4crd Major|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: wow   other room  Grue in 3@CX|pg||
nt|petergill: he plans to ruff two hearts in dummy then try to pick spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or deWijs to hold @HH10?|pg||
nt|ady: would be betterof without 10@S   which gives the losing option|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX should make 6 or 7 or so tricks, one would think|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is also the option of another @h finesse now ... to get rid of the losing @s|pg||
nt|petergill: If de Wijs inserts @H10 on the next @h from dummy, it's tempting to finesse the jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller probably plays @HK @HQ randomly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but perhaps @HK would give Zagorin pause|pg||
nt|rhelle: by now West knows that East has the @h KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that Rob?|pg||
nt|rhelle: so inserting the @h 10 is a doable false card|pg||
nt|rhelle: very unlikely that declarer would finesse the H9 in trick 2, missing only 10 and Q|pg||
nt|petergill: Many lines were possible e.g. if declarer could tell that clubs are 6-2 not 7-1 (at this vul, 7 card clubs might bid 4@C not 3@C), then alt line of ruff club and finesse @S10, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: eventually making on crossruff which needs 1-4 @D, was possible.|pg||
nt|rhelle: if Bauke had the Ace, he'd cash it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime   the other room, which started 10 minutes after us, is already on board 22|pg||
nt|petergill: We learnt yesterday (Wooldridge's 6@S) that predicting the outcome of the play of slams like this one is difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller taking 1 of his famous pauses..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult ... especially of the future|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I heard he is looking for inspiration in those|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller no doubt hesitating between a trump and a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, he's wondering why declarer pitched a spade at Trick 1|pg||
nt|rhelle: a trump to stop 1 ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|rhelle: or a @c to force declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: This long think, if read correctly by an opponent, might clue a Grue-like declarer into thinking that E does not have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it looked like he is about to play a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: with @SQ, E might exit more quickly in @d or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Transnational Quarter Final  with 8 boards to score  Gordon over [heavy favorite] Angelini  by 31|pg||
nt|rhelle: assuming what Muller has based on his pauzes is a very dangerous business, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a @d exit is normal now, as if you have a singleton club. Or perhaps exit with @S3?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wooldridge on track to make 5@HX on  2  via double finesse in @C|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|wstuart: Well, the 4-5 minor opening here has no choice - NS are playing a strong @C so the @D is nebulous.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S    but inlikely to lead club|pg||
nt|wstuart: When N rebids 2@C, he shows longer @C than @D.|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOLID SCORE FOR TEAM AMERICA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: All the pauses he has done when I've been commentating have been very revealing about the cards he has in his hand, if the oppoent is a Grue, a Hamman or a Meckstroth (i.e. someone ...|pg||
nt|petergill: who can read such things)|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting ... maybe the Dutch coaches should analyse that|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: 11 to USA   hand 2   5@HX   and made   conceeding 300  at this table|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver play  3@D-3@S as non-force   not a common treatment|pg||

nt|bobholl: or pass (a good alternative|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that opens up  1N-2@H//2@S-2N as artificial to show 2 suiters [and other things]|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: yes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: 12 -14 nt doubtful|pg||
nt|ady: but defence should still prfevail even with jack going up|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Smith helps reveal declarer's falsecard|pg||
nt|barbyh: has not a prayer of making|pg||
nt|ady: always difficult not to play jack in that position    lead  could be from KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when not needed to win or show count in declarer's suit --  standard Smith   Hi says  I like the opening lead   Lo says  I don't like the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs play Reverse Smith  [think upside down attitude]|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rhelle: 1NT is very aggressive with the North hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: will woodbridge pass now with 5 ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is supposed to show 4-fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@D opening at this suitable vulnerability on 8 card suit seems normal to me, but |pg||
nt|ady: this hopeless|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1@d would have been a reasonable alternative|pg||
nt|roswolf: west took a cautious view of his hand - quite rightly at these colors|pg||
nt|ady: looks ligh making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rhelle: and to add to the insult, he finesses the @c :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not until you see location of @SQ|pg||
nt|ady: to be fair if the spades came in then would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that helped Wooldridge balance|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: system wise,  not sure|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3rd and 4th hand, the restrictions are lifted, as there are no more relays|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 12-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spot leads  3rd/low|pg||
mb|r|nt|rhelle: a GOOD 12 :)|pg||

nt|petergill: NS System Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: It looks like the @d ruff will hold them to 9 tricks, if West rises on the first heart - he may not|pg||
nt|rhelle: at first glance declarer looks to have 10 tricks. However, after the @d lead, he can choose to lose an extra trump or suffer a @d ruff|pg||
nt|rhelle: so I predict this contract will just scrpe in|pg||
nt|rhelle: *scrape*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expecting Hurd to have 0--2@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 aces and a bidding parftner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: West is thinking BOTH - do I play partner for a singleton @D - and - do I rise when a @H is led from dummy later?|pg||
nt|ady: just down 1 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that means  3rd from even   of cards   low from odd    [3,5,7]|pg||
nt|bobholl: i hope this will be the nail in the coffin :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since they overbid -- the raise is a winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: easier to duck @SJ  playing 3rd/5th leads|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1:  4 Hurd 3N north|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in college we decided since all invitational bids were accepted we'd change system to make them SLAM tries|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|petergill: hence West's very smooth low play on the 1st @H - it was the only chance to beat 3@H|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: oh well commentators curse in action again |pg||
nt|ady: need to be a good guesser|pg||
nt|warrens:  do N/S play 4th best or attitude leads vs nt?|pg||
nt|petergill: Still very likely to make 3NT on @S lead, by playing towards @HQJx twice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL could have been  Strong NT  [2@H]   so again  delayed @H bid from Verhees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very reasonable choice|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: More on Bd 21: when experts play bridge back home, they often falsecard to try to trick you. But when they represent their country, falsecards early in the play, like West's first ...|pg||
nt|petergill: spade, are much much less common because experts when repping their country feel some need to play "properly", to not be the person who costs the game. Hence trusting that early @S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: pip = good pip power. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW did well to force NS guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is only defensive start that gives declarer problems|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rhelle: they play better seeing 13 cards that I do with all 52 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is fallout of playing Raptor NT overcall|pg||
nt|ady: now needs switch|pg||
nt|ady: should know  cannot bring in hearts with only 1 outside entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck kills West @H suit  but  @C switch a different grief for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: USA   must  get these situations right from now to have any chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge knows North  2/3@S   and J9xx in dummy dangerous   seems to point to @C shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they see things deeper than I do :(|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of clubs played and discards not fun for n/s |pg||
nt|petergill: attitude leads to NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting; there is a double @d finesse as well that can be taken|pg||
nt|petergill: so W does not know if @s are 4-4 or 5-3 - good point, Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  with attitude leads this is much harder|pg||
nt|ady: well played Wooldridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now declarer needs East to hold @SAK     i think|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: @D now and indeed problems|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: indeed - they certainly turn over the imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bas looks like, come on Sjoert... |pg||
nt|ady: does need either KQ clubs onside   or doubleton honor   as defence do have 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I feel  3@H better that double by south|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: kept them out of a slam that needs some luck on a spade lead  cutting of the 3rd heart trick|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 to play in transnational QuarterFinal   Gordon 72  Angelina 34   both teams have former world champs, but Angelini  Fantunes & Meckwell|pg||

nt|roswolf: on bd 4 usa in 5! @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they started teasing SJoert|pg||

pc|s2|nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|barbyh: they wont have any trouble defending this|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rhelle: Yes, EW play attitude against NT, so declarer has no clue about North's @s length|pg||
nt|warrens:  now declarer hopes to learn something from the discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N can pitch 2 @h's and then one more card (=?) if clubs are run|pg||
nt|warrens:  one reasonable line is a @d to the 9, then try a @D to the Q the next time|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play diamond finesse   for contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is that immediate @H bids from Verhees say  just 1 place to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where delayed auction says 2 places  and that is why vanProoijen pulled|pg||
nt|ady: may just cost a couple of imps playing clubs rather than hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW auction is consistent regardless of who holds @CQ|pg||
nt|ady: I am assumming tot losing a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but gave them a shot at 4@SX     but point is  they forced NS to make the last guess|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: NS System Card (attitude leads to NT is "low = like") http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 2 @h to QJ is 75%|pg||
nt|rhelle: @d to Q is 50%|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Rusinow leads against suit & nt   i.e.  lead 2nd of touching honors|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: yes   that does cater for J10 diamonds onside   but in this case might go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: North not vul has passed over 1@C ---> 5 card suit a bit less likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: but that is only if you know @s are 4-4 ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more doesn't matter much non vul|pg||
nt|rhelle: remember kibitzers, NS play attitude leads. So the @s2 indicates an honour, not length|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: I think W has deliberately timed his club cashing sequence so N has to discard twice before South discards --> N's problem a little bit tougher|pg||
pc|s5|nt|warrens:  @D to the 9, then to the Q is 62.5%, so a @H to the QJ means you're more than 80% sure N has only 4 @S's|pg||
nt|petergill: W from the attitude lead knows N has @SQxxx or @SQxxxx so he wants North to discard before S, as S has easy @s discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N has (cunningly?) kept his @H discard until last, to try to look more like a man with 5332 shape|pg||
nt|rhelle: the big strength of NS is their incredibly tight defence|pg||
nt|petergill: (I think) N knew he had to make 2 more discards, so he released the @D (less comfortable discard) before the @H, to make the position less clear to West. |pg||
nt|petergill: If S releases another @S, W can play @H safely unless N has @HAK |pg||
nt|ady: whats the betting here?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm going for -1 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: red card discard, else this makes easily|pg||
nt|rhelle: but I'm heavily biased|pg||
nt|petergill: I was wrong - spade discard ---> @S can rise @HA on @H of dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: NS first discard   odd = encourage|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, but taking those discards at face value is a direct route to the poorhouse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S point was right, because then @S have broken 4-4, so S cannot throw a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: NS UDCA with 1st discard odd encourage|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H lead in OR    so no problem|pg||
nt|warrens:  we can see by this auction that W's distribution is concealed, making it harder for the defense (and putting us to sleep as we wait)|pg||
nt|petergill: so N's @D6 and @S's @S3 discard were really telling declarer as little as possible|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands might go in front |pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller is of course known for his phenomenal thinks|pg||

nt|ady: after a 2nd diamond   club normal play|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: It looks like a major card was led by the Dutch in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: was about last hand :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone either bid or implied @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: tough hand to play. If South has the @hK, North must have everything else - and then it's hard to make|pg||
nt|petergill: Correction - only Oz Open (q/f finished) and Parimatch (one board to go, 60+ imps ahead) have won the Transnat quarters - the other two matches have 4 or 5 boards to go|pg||
nt|ady: will certainly make if taking the right view now|pg||
nt|rhelle: So I think that he will finesse @h - easier than to rely on than lots of other things behaving|pg||
nt|ady: A@D and heart finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that Gordon v Angelini match is on BBO right now --  of the 8 players, 7 have won at least one world champtionship|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H was in case East was looking for slam - alas 4@H has wrongsided the contract slightly for the Dutch|pg||

nt|roswolf: if south bids on the artillery will start firng|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North looks like to have minors|pg||
nt|wstuart: The lucky star the American EW were playing under burned out on board 4.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and south showed 6-4|pg||
nt|petergill: With so many possible finesses, is taking the @H hook only a play for those who can see all 52 cards?|pg||

mb|5H!|nt|vugraphznt: EW lead attitude against NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 9 can be H98 or HH98, |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: So East denies the @H10 and always has an honour|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that could win the worst lead of the year award|pg||
nt|bobholl: RKC will get them to 5 and luckily the @C position is good for holland|pg||

pc|c3|nt|petergill: With only 16 HCP missing, North figured to have @HK, even with S's heart bids|pg||
nt|petergill: and he expects black kings to be offside in opener's hand, thus needed @H hook|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller worked that bit out fast - now, with limited entries to his hand, he has to figure out what to do next ---> takes time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director is here for some time already, didn't say they are late, but they are, and it looks like he is looking who is slow|pg||
nt|petergill: That also happened yesterday at Muller's table when playing against Hurd and Wooldridge|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rhelle: great switch!|pg||
nt|petergill: If EW had @S8, then I think Muller would cash @SA before the heart hook, in case @SK was singleton, but @SJ108x in S is hard to pick up with lack of entries|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru  6  Israel Juniors extend lead over Australia Open  to 40 imps in  Transnational Teams Final|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: NS can beat it if they set up 2 clubs tricks for N early -- to accomplish this, S needs 2 entries to lead clubs twice, so the unblock is essential -- very well done by N |pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: not many options    best  surely ace and another spade   hoping for king doubleton   and when not trust to luck only 1 club loser|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: west will run out of exit cards|pg||
nt|petergill: In due course, as we can see (but East cannot see the 52 cards), all lines work. |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: the Q@D play excellent    and is an answer to playing spade to the 10 |pg||
nt|ady: now must be club  ducked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall's @H holding too strong |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C includes 21+ balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: more likely e/w could make game in hearts    but 4 losers with A@D wrong|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT = 4-card limit raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I think they have 40 minutes for 5 hands - in my opinion, South has been the slowest player at this table|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerability wrong for a 5@H save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Bathurst also saw vulnerability when he bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
nt|bobholl: this won't hurt hurd :)|pg||
nt|chick: is 7@H makeable?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: RDBL with 3-fit   haven't seen that before|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it shows GOOD 3-fit|pg||
mb|p!|an|dbl would show balanced|nt|sybarra: I think the 1 @C alert is "could be 2" |pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: i'll have to get up to speed on the N/S system - not sure exactly what the bids mean - looks sort of like Polish so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he always is slow |pg||
nt|ady: but they have taken it|pg||
nt|ady: wrong again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS must be forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: hmm   i wonder how they differentiate 3@S & 2N   thought 1 might show 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: nothing going for USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The fact that we're seeing so many transfers (2@H showing spades) in the WC Grand Final is food for thought for those who don't like such methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally  PASS with 2   accept transfer with 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C now |pg||
nt|bobholl: only 2 down :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 4@H and what does Hurd do|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: and that might e also Bart |pg||
nt|bbramley: i think 1@D=0-7, then natural|pg||
nt|bbramley: if so, i'm a little surprised south did not upgrade to a positive with his good suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 1@S was asking. 1@D was or 0-7 or something with both majors or a 3rd option i dont anymore|pg||
nt|rhelle: with 3@d, North shows values. South opts to defend, so North is happy with that|pg||
nt|ady: so the USA in game in both rooms  and more imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, this looks like -1 and 6 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|petergill: For the Transnational, the format in yesterday's Daily Bulletin (number 11) overrules any format on the website|pg||
nt|ady: 6 imps   so close to 6 imps behind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure with 4-fit in 1462|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit Woolsey might argue for lead of 3 card suit |pg||
nt|ady: USA    get lucky   heart lead no chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: unfortunately 4@H should fail last hand e/w   and 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure they've defined Wooldridge PASS   but we don't know :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: wooldridge not worth more than 4 @S imo|pg||
nt|april7: still 7, the 9 takes care of it!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great analysis   do you think there is any chance they'll bid it??|pg||
nt|chick: kibs are split about 80-20 that 7@H can make :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: with @S 4-1 ?|pg||
nt|chick: 7@S cannot make because of the 4-1 split, but 7@H looks makeable tome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy analysis of card play is academic if auction can't get there|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rhelle: South should now play the @sK, in case declarer needs to find the @cQ|pg||
nt|ady: but always likely to get to 3NT   and likely to make  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 to instill doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing reverse count/attitude   7 could also come from  J74|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: rdbl says 3 card and I want you to play|pg||
nt|ady: plenty of time for defence to get all the tricks|pg||
nt|chick: too true, Al, but maybe they can get to 6@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7 @H surely can make 9 of @D is the extra trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: WOW   on 27  Grue-Lall bid 3N on the perfecta layout|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: blame Jeff Rubens series of articles in Bridge World,  Useful Space Principal  for expanding use of tranfers beyond bids over 1N opener|pg||
nt|chick: the real reason that 7@H is biddable is that USA2 needs it|pg||
mb|5N|nt|bbramley: OK - 1@S forced 1NT, then 2@H was a transfer|pg||
nt|bbramley: so he transferred to play the hand himself :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this might be a bit difficult to handle |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Daily Bulletin 11 says 24 board R16 matches in Transnational. Bull 11 also has interesting article about the massive preparation by Indonesia Ladies for this event ref pages 28 and ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 15 I think, at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose if @C feature, might explore @D slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction is getting very interesting|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@S could make    but in some danger    has done well to take the penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps Wooldridge expects only 4@S from Hurd??|pg||
nt|bobholl: too interesting :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with clearer 1 or 2 suiter -- Hurd would not PASS 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge almost bid 6@S, and is rethinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm already impressed that they found 6@H after 3@S    anything more is astounding|pg||
nt|chick: my kib opinion count is up to 42 making vs 6 can't make 7@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I"m told that in the Transnats, one pair bid 6@H making 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Clever @sQ by North - he's hiding the Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dutch pick up another 5 imps on  7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm guessing   4@H natural  exactly 4@H else 3@H rather than DBL   5@C cuebid  5N pick-a-slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks as a good guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wstuart: It's possible for the Dutch to win 6 on the last board.  4@H -1 will be -50.|pg||
nt|chick: we all agree that the @D9 is the key card, when the J10 fall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think impressive recovery to get to 6@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who are asking     3@S wouldn't occur to me either|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bbramley: he'd like about 5 entries to his own hand, but he's a little short of that|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sr 10 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will correct in a second|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 25 here on BBO has been scored the same way it is scored (10 imp swing) on the WBF website and thus on the Bridgemate as scored by the players.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and bet they discuss later if     a) there was easier way   b)  they could/should get to 7@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: thought he might pitch |pg||
nt|bbramley: the clubs are good, which would let him throw a small card in each red suit, but that would have conceded down 1|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: and Oswald Jacoby for original transfer concept|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even in context of Big Club system   too many losers, not enough winners  for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver-Brink 2@C auction uninterrupted so far|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bbramley: so instead he's ruffed up, which will fail as well because west's trumps are too good|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N weak NT, not 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: this is a poor setup for the N/S methods - north has been preempted into showing his second suit at a high level|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he wants to get doubled in 6 spades |pg||
nt|rhelle: no XX?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i didn't know KTxx was on the list|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst writing a lot, Zagorin just sitting not alerting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: semi alerts 2@C now|pg||
nt|ady: agressive move by north|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = penalty, shows max passed hand, acc to their System Card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14 bal or  1@S444|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@H, not 4@S, not 1@S 3-suit  [2@D]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller just making forcing noises|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: or 5 ?|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, a striped tale X|pg||
nt|sybarra: no XX,  "we" are happy |pg||
nt|ady: good value for australians|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just announced in voice commentary    Senior Bowl  France leads USA2 by 4+fraction  just a few boards to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  25  also  5@HX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  our room wasn't doubled|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: stripe tail ape...preventing 6 sp bid|pg||
nt|petergill: 1050 to 1430 = 9 imps|pg||
nt|ady: Brink has a pretty useless hand for spades  especially on ace king and another spade opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: South surely has a dead maximum for his 14-16 1NT opening.  Facing the inv+ xfr, he has a clear 4@H bid.|pg||
nt|ady: this will fil   so dutch will dow ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Not here, he is very silent:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D  4@H 5+@D, 0/1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Ben!    |pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphznt: Grue: good luck, this time I mean it...|pg||
nt|ady: fail|pg||
nt|wstuart: It was a 1NT overcall, so he's not at a max.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Still, he has a fine hand with a fit, nice controls and a 5 card suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink has no idea if he is on time.. he asked they have 55 min for those last boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wasn't Symmetric Relay  developed by New Zealand's  Dr Kerr?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bbramley: of course, it's usually a poor setup to have a light opener into a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but sometimes pards clubs are more like his spade suit |pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: or spade suit is more like the club suit I should say |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - opening on distro is always optimistic, hoping for a fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you probably roll for 6 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he has 3 trumps to lose and the @H ace off the top, and there may be a handling charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps maybe the difficulty |pg||
nt|bbramley: although if he runs some diamonds, west may be tempted to compromise his trump holding (but i doubt he will)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12, 2 @S only went down 1 in other room,  for 3 imps |pg||
nt|bbramley: USA2 nibbling away...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: ahhh Roy Kerr|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: and we have a looooooooooooonggg way to go |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C forced 2@D   and 2@S signoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Ker   i never remember   or r's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in New Zealand, he might be better known as award winning Phyicist|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks  unless defence cash quickly when in with K@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to win spade and lay down A@D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: maybe double after passing something in their methods|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: Hurd may have tht diamond defensive with west   and only 4@S from Muller    |pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North will reason that EW have a @c fit - and that West will have the @d. So he'll pay a @d to the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: gee they split 1/1 |pg||
nt|petergill: Then 2@C shows usually 4!+ clubs, u run into your lowest suit. Dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|ady: everyone in the action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps to Netherlands for making 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
nt|ady: 5 imps for Netherlands hand 25    5@HX  making|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bbramley: from declarer's perspective, all he needs is 3-3 trumps and a winning guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2@C forced 2@D   2@S = 1-suit invite|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes give W the East cards and probably home |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the spade cards)  |pg||
nt|bbramley: other room stopped in 2@S and made 140, so this should be 6 imps more for USA2|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: This is fairly normal - I too play it - that you dbl with a max passed hand, taking pressure off partner's need to make marginal pen dbls when u are passed hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for passed hand balancing DBL to be Woolsey   4-major and 5+minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1-suit @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially for pairs that play Mini-Landy in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl backfired as it (unluckily?) pushed EW out of their poor 1NT contract into a better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mini-Landy = Woolsey but with DBL=Penalty|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: hoping to bring in club suit   and lose 1 club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: thats is the end of that|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  Al   you type faster|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 26 a quiet  2@S East|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rhelle: but what did East double on? Even at my level, this is suspect|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl ---> 1600 to 1430 = 5 imps the other way, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry   Multi-Landy  not Mini|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: Now that East knows @DA is offside from the opening lead, he can perhaps ruff out the short @DA and make 2@S for a big gain|pg||
nt|ady: swkward communication   but as 10@C comes down in 3   does not matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Transnational   thru 8   Israel over Australia by 41|pg||
nt|ady: now no communication problem when k@D taken |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bbramley: this room has finally slowed down enough to let the other room get ahead - that will give us comparisons :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: good j@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|warrens:  on a XX, wouldn't Hurd reconsider?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Senior   France now leads USA2 by 2|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down1   cannot ruff 2 hearts  and avoide a club ruff  if coming back with A@C    |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: diamond best|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: BD3 1@hx-3 team america scored 660 on 3nt+2 so 4 imps to the home team|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: Venice Cup   France over Indonesia by 52|pg||

nt|petergill: I think @d10 now is slightly better than @h ruff, but am not sure|pg||

nt|ahollan1: which part of nz you from?    my ex partner plays out of dunedin|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: ok North is back|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, (3)4+@D, unbal, 3@D if (41)35, maybe 2245|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Redbl would almost certainly go P P 6@C or 5NT by East, then what happens next = I know not|pg||
nt|ady: must have been a diamond lead  for 12 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D led|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder what 5@S would mean now? Natural, strong slam suggestion?|pg||
nt|ady: I am told it was|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its good to have an agreement what the meaning of 4@S is by west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin will open South  -- but even playing Big Club   Verhees may not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: even so, nasty problem for West. It could be anything, from 4@s to 7@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is tightening nicely -(for us neutrals)|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge was afraid Hurd psyched a pass|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle: whereas South had an EVEN number of Clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's imagination is working overtime if he thought about bidding here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@C is something more than 5+@D but couldn't read what was written|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 4+@S|pg||

nt|roswolf: perhaps spades as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike old days   Ace asks Attitude|pg||
pc|s2|nt|warrens:  So, South meant the 9 to show a @H card and N took it as an odd number|pg||
nt|drewsky: It all depends on their defensive agreements...if the 9 of @C was count, then south erred. However, many experts us tend to play suit prefernce|pg||
nt|rhelle: fortunately, NS will sit out the next session|pg||
nt|ady: can make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D lead director?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: I think N played W for AKQJxxxxx void x Kxx, but that seems unlikely on the bidding - but he has to trust his partner's count card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if RDBL=@S  i would think Grue DBL=3@S|pg||
nt|ady: what is 3@H  game try   or barrage after east re-doubled?|pg||

nt|petergill: South has some extras not shown by 3NT - North might pass. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: last of the championship for our table :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx for watching all!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphznt: Grue telling 4@D was making after this auction, guessing the @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final 16 boards of the championship  begins  1 hour 30 minutes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: USA   plenty to do   but still a long way to go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal 18+ bal     lots of controls so upgrade?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: The investment in advanced bidding technique by Brink and Drijver, compared to the natural American auction, was the main reason for that swing. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   15-17|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @D & a major|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: bad lay for 4@H  e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) 0-8 HCP  b) 9+ HCP 0-1 Controls [A=2 K=1]|pg||

nt|chick: This has been a fantastic tournament!  The voice commentary from BBO, the excellent organization and production of the tourney, the live stream so we could actually watch the ...|pg||
nt|chick: players live, everything about this has been world class!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will bid game I would think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=16-18|pg||
nt|ady: thx all   thx to our operator   and specs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N ostensibly 14-16|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: this looks like 4@H i agree david|pg||
nt|ady: J@H    best lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Harold   and thx all and kibs|pg||
nt|roswolf: although west does only have a 9 count|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the set    thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: loud applause from the live vugraph room|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  3rd vul & always 4th|pg||
nt|warrens:  a nice squeeze on the previous hand for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set of the day begins  in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: was a plesure to be here, and a plesure to broadcast it! :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and they confirm  Netherlands last win was 18 years ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D=5+@H, INV+|pg||
nt|ady: looks on the face of it down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  12  Brink-Drijver have found their @H fit|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  no use either on diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 4@H where Grue played 3@S|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ady: kib suggested 3NT       but that also should fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a little too much testosterone i think|pg||
nt|ady: might get a diamond loser on 3rd spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Unsure about meanings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Transnational  thru 27   Israel +33 over OZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OZ = australia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe oldest player on Israel is 25|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice if they bid 6@H on this one |pg||
mb|5H|nt|rhelle: now @d7 is count - odd number|pg||
nt|warrens:  needed to start with a @C, but most players avoid leading from Axxx against NT|pg||
nt|ady: if north comes in with A@C   will likely switch to a spade   and south will probably cash out for down 1|pg||
nt|ady: thx Gerbrand    thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you don't want to wait for the next set of this match  --- other rooms still playing   and  Transnational schedule is offset from us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=21-23|pg||
nt|ady: thx all   thx Jan   thx Al for your explanations    and thx specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Gerbrabd   and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: next set will be in 1 hr from now, at 13.45 local time|pg||
nt|petergill: so I would chalk those Dutch imps down to Team Orange's training and the investment by Hans Melchers or Mr Drexelford(?) or whoever created the Team Orange training concept in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Netherlands|pg||
nt|ady: clu ruff beats 4@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 players 25  that really brings up the average age|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set of the day begins in about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  since S has all the entries, this should make easily|pg||
nt|ady: or win and switch to clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N scramble   2 places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Justin Lall tried lead of @SA|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 30: The golden rule of expert bridge is to trust partner, not the opponents. Thus, when N is faced with a choice between two impossibilities, he must trust partner, not the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: opponent who appears to have pulled out the wrong bidding card (went for 4@S and accidentally bid 6@S off two aces) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice try from John Hurd|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hurd gave up, he really threw the pass card|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge, why didn't bid 7 then?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: 1st session of Transnational Final has already started|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Joel Wooldridge was ashamed of the opening bid, i guess|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rhelle: As south, you can 'see' that North must have a virtual yarborough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems normal to shift to @Cx|pg||
nt|petergill: low club now looks normal to me|pg||
nt|petergill: too|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry @c loser|pg||
nt|petergill: Then @DQ - king ..... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: many specs also pointing out @D ruffing finesse to ditch 3rd @C|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like more imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more sets in Senior Bowl and Venice Cup    Bermuda Bowl plays 2 more today and 2 sets tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinking about @H2|pg||
nt|ady: might do it by ruffing out K@D  and coming back with a heart and discarding a club in east hand|pg||
nt|petergill: if North ducks @DQ in normal tempo (unlikely, normal is to cover in case S has the jack), then |pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: notice that EW don't play 'system on' either|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great analyst  says  "thus, ACE and a club may get declarer to misguess who has the doubleton"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Australia Open  vs   Israel Juniors   both young teams   [except for one OZ pair]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of tables in Transnational only on 11   the other finishing 14  so still a lot of vugraph to watch after we're done here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And some youngsters playing there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller is the only player in the final to have a previous World Championship|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think the youngest from Australia is 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil  Edgtton  19 or maybe just turned 20|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: curious that in a Transnational   that both teams in finals are  mono-country  [i know  not a real work]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps he should have offered 5@D|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: don't know age of Israel Juniors|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands have made a nice recovery   |pg||
nt|roswolf: what happened there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Grue smoothly ducked @CA...|pg||
nt|ady: slip up    but should still be -1   if no other mistake|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: this looks flat  so of for some lunch     thx    all    bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can/should make shouldnt it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "@CA, @C, @D ruffout, @HA, @D for a pitch, @S to jack DUCKED..."|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i should say  OPEN World Championship|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bbramley: so this should be 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a likely push |pg||
nt|bbramley: thx everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: see you all in about 1 hour |pg||
nt|bbramley: i'm told other room is in 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 3 nt at the other table |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: i wish i could see stuff like that |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: for the kibs who does think this score indicates a win by the Dutch pls do not forget we only played half of the match (64 out of 128)|pg||
nt|ady: another swing for Netherlands   a cvery fgood set|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: this almost certainly a push|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: thx all   bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: room stays open until the open room has finished...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 4 boards to go in open room..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ohhh NZ hebben nog 2 zwarte Azen...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: open room ready, this table is clsosing... back in 30 minutes....|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|petergill: @DA play at Trick 1 suggested N had @DK, so club switch would not have beaten this, I think|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  Well, Al,that's not true. Its just that the 9 won by the US were all Junior WC|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 22, 25 and..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lots of Junior World championships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table is on final board too|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|petergill: More on Bd 30 (due to many spec comments): If you do not trust partner above all else, then the mistakes are your own, not partner's. Chaos lies down that track, in bridge and in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: life. Enough on that topic.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now official congratulations to Netherlands|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rhelle: totally agree, Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: getting a count to see which 41 @S break to protect against|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|ady: no  end played later    J@S     from hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx all, cu in 55 min|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they were just in time|pg||
nt|petergill: and don't forget that USA2 has a sponsor who will play less in the 2nd half |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: some risk to that   and cost a trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: bad error  by North|pg||
mc|12|nt|vugraphznt: thx, and cu a next time|pg||
nt|chick: So a huge THANK YOU to everyone who has been involved in this 2011 Bermuda Bowl!   WELL DONE!|pg||
