nt|rv: here some play 3@s as void spl and 3n (@s stiff)/4m as splinter|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: direct 4@H bid by S in CR very unlikely (must be operators summary)?|pg||

mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: big chance for usa2 to level the score|pg||
nt|nkgupt: wudda prefered 2nt from S(an NT cuebid :))|pg||
nt|rhelle: Looking at the North hand, it's hard to envisage slam. In fact, you hope not to get doubled in 4|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: I predict the lead of a small trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: 1NT by East, 2cl by South, and then 4 Hearts by North|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|jaapfr vg: would any of us also pass as S on 4@H?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rhelle: After a strong @c opening, partner can be messing around|pg||
nt|rhelle: so yes|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as while bidding 4@c S knows no encouraging noise is going to come from N|pg||
nt|rv: there is school of thought that on strong @c, you pass with good hand and come in next round of bidding|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is what South did|pg||
nt|rv: I am not a big fan of that approach though Zagorin prefers that|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|nkgupt: yes but w/ this hand u sure ur pd will need 2 chances to show any sort of movement|pg||

nt|rhelle: 4@s is a very practical bid, facing a limited (11-15) partner|pg||

nt|sybarra: good very early morning from Washington DC,  hello Bart |pg||
nt|bbramley: the play of the @S10 was unusual in that it might cost a trick if south started with Qx or Jx, but could gain if south started with Qxx or Jxx|pg||

nt|rhelle: 2@s is an awkward contract. No entries in hand to traw trumps. And too few of them anyway|pg||
nt|rv: best lead as well|pg||
nt|rhelle: No doubt East will duck trick 1, as the lead (3) is from 3rd. So he 'knows' declarer has 3 as well|pg||

nt|nkgupt: why wud S object to 1nt w/ 7 hcp?:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: and he hasn't got an attractive return if he wins - so best to wait and se|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bbramley: very light opening - in the modern style, or a very old-fashioned style, if you will - his hand qualifies easily by losing trick count, if not by honor count|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|bbramley: this is a poor setup for the N/S methods - north has been preempted into showing his second suit at a high level|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: of course, it's usually a poor setup to have a light opener into a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but sometimes pards clubs are more like his spade suit |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: or spade suit is more like the club suit I should say |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - opening on distro is always optimistic, hoping for a fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you probably roll for 6 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he has 3 trumps to lose and the @H ace off the top, and there may be a handling charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps maybe the difficulty |pg||
nt|bbramley: although if he runs some diamonds, west may be tempted to compromise his trump holding (but i doubt he will)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12, 2 @S only went down 1 in other room,  for 3 imps |pg||
nt|bbramley: USA2 nibbling away...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: and we have a looooooooooooonggg way to go |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|bbramley: from declarer's perspective, all he needs is 3-3 trumps and a winning guess|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes give W the East cards and probably home |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the spade cards)  |pg||
nt|bbramley: other room stopped in 2@S and made 140, so this should be 6 imps more for USA2|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: would be interesting to see defense against 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|rhelle: West is showing a very strong hand in this sequence. First X, then 2@s traditionally shows a strong 1-suited hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: wise stop 3@H|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: but 4@H can be made|pg||
nt|rhelle: the @d10 is showing count; odd number|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: W has a super awful hand to defend|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this is point where defense against 4@H would be interesting|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rhelle: He has. I think he'll shift to the @cK. His only chance to defeat this if partner has the Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) would Muller still show 3@D?  [fearing dangerous shift]   b) would deWijs shift to @CK|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yes nice kib comment: W was endplayed at trick 1:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: after lead 4@h seems to be uncut|pg||

pc|hQ|mc|10|nt|jaapfr vg: no indeed that is only 9 tricks|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: NS play 14-16 throughout   so Bathurst didn't have game ambition|pg||

nt|rhelle: Saturday :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: all days looking alike to me after 1.5 weeks|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 3nt-2 not a very good board for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this @S lead best before looking at all hands?    Bocchi tried @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: True - but defence isn't so easy either. So he's not down yet|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: rob 1nt W is 12-14?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 12-15|pg||
nt|rhelle: no, good 12 to 15|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|rhelle: so they pass bad 12-counts; especially vul|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: balanced 23 not enough for 3nt so E no way to end the bidding in 2nt?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yesterday they opened some hands i thought they would pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wish i could remember if any of them were 1N|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: back to the opening lead  --  imagine the result if you exchange South @SJ9 with West @Sxx|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's a risky lead, for sure. Most experts lead passively against 1NT and 3NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: a wise 1nt EW in CR|pg||
nt|rhelle: he needs to make something of the @cs to have any chance|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|rhelle: so he'll play the 10|pg||
