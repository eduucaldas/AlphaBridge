mb|2H!|an|12-16 5!h4!c|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: EW playing some sort of Roman Club system?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, if the side suit is known to be clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ugis: ok h+c...then pass is ok|pg||

nt|athene: the idea of leading a big card, so that only one defender can win, and might not be the one with the trump, is quite well-known|pg||

nt|queequeg: Welcome to our super commentators Pierre Schimdt, Joe Shair|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|djneill:  well they opened 1@d with 11 and rebid 1NT last hand, so maybe this is 14+-17|pg||
nt|chmitty: Ciao Francesca @h|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh, the pressure...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not everybody's 2@h bid.|pg||
nt|chmitty: Lavazza heads the classification after 3 rounds (9 to be played in total)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|djneill:  2@d = one major|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|djneill:  2@h = "pass with @h, bid 2@s with @s"|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure ... everything possible (including 15-17) ... if East decided to upgrade :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  West not sure if @s or not, so just Passed 2@d, assuming North would bid again !|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  2@d is a common treatment in europe so probably E-W have discussed this delayed 3@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  East is anxious to get that heart lead into the AQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: thk West could bid 3@S immediately ... but prefered to use - evidently kind of Lebensohl |pg||
nt|chmitty: Catani in 9th place : they badly need a victory against this strong team|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chmitty: Can you make this despite the 4-1 @c split ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: with four she would surely bid 2@S herself|pg||

mb|2S|nt|athene: south has a choice now between 2@S and 2NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: Ciao :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|djneill:  East doubles to show 4+@s (1@s would deny @s)|pg||
nt|djneill:  of course|pg||
nt|danilo1: most of my (serious) bridge careet, I played in Italy :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: x shows @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|djneill:  ok North chose to reopen with 2@s rather than double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning from the beautiful Poconos.  |pg||
mb|2S|nt|djneill:  the major suits are indeed quality|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: 2@S by North is kind of ... Mixed events bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  I hesitate to bid 2@s though since South chose not to bid 1@s (or anything for that matter) over X|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this trump suit is quite interesting|pg||
nt|queequeg: the open room started right now :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barbyh: clubs are well placed for East|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: if you know east has the ace, the percentage play is small to king, then duck on|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok North doubles the third time and thankfully South likes this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: CATTANI - BRIDGE BOLOGNA RASTIGNANO  after 3 round is in 9° position with 36 points - Lavazza first with 61 points|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: duck one|pg||
nt|chmitty: we can see that 3@h is a make so you must defeat 2@s|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: that gains against @HAx and @HAxx with east, and loses only to @HAJx|pg||
pc|s4|nt|djneill:  here, count is most important (how many spades will cash), so South will play a low @s|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chmitty: 5 only losers but I believe declarer will run short of trumps too soon|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|barbyh: but not enough entries for the second club finesse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: of course it would have been harder after a club lead then three rounds of spades, with west threatening to overruff dummy :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|barbyh: perhaps west might have bid 2nt to slow the auction down|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: i guess east was going for singleton spade with partner but that was a bit of a long shot i think|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|danilo1: if 11s dble promissed @S .. someting is wrong with EW system ... why should notEast be able to Dble for penalty - and if so agreed, why than West does not Dble instead of 3@D ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: (already promissed 6-cards) bidding 2@D free|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|djneill:  ok so West should probably cash the @dA here because North has at most 1 diamond, it might be the King, but West may think South has all the diamonds, in which case, not cashing the dA is better so as to have the end position better|pg||
nt|djneill:  but for sure, West cannot pick up all the diamonds, North will not have a doubleton on this auction|pg||

nt|barbyh: weve got Benito Garozzo in the USA|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: if east decides to lead passively, say a diamond, i suppose you might just cash the @HAK intending to try to set up spades for a club pitch|pg||

mb|p|nt|danilo1: but maybe, South treated her hand as three-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: say @DQ, @HAK, then if both defenders follow but no @HQ appeared, you would go @SA, spade ruff, @DA, spade ruff, but you need something very good to happen in spades|pg||

nt|djneill:  bleeding 4 rounds of trumps, is just 8 tricks, besides the transportation problems so I think South will ruff some tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|djneill:  assuming it is a 3-suiter, a trump lead would have been more normal|pg||
nt|danilo1: however, I find North's 3@C bid too bold, even if he can project single @S at pd|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes he knows it will be rough play, 3suiters don't play too well|pg||
nt|djneill:  and South will reopen with a double surely if short in @s|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|athene: hmmm i can't believe south really did this|pg||

nt|Vugraphzps: ehy trust the vugraph operator :)|pg||
nt|athene: and she would surely never play the hand that way?|pg||
nt|athene: ok :)|pg||
nt|ugis: so my initial prediction was right - she will make it :)|pg||
nt|athene: seems odd that declarer would use up the dummy entry and abandon those @HAK if she didn't have another heart|pg||
nt|athene: but then what she actually did was odd anyway :)|pg||
nt|ugis: and its not over yet :)|pg||

nt|djneill:  ok brd 1 worked out for Nardullo when E-W in the other room bid to 3@s on a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: some peoples open 1 NT with West hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|djneill:  brd 17 that is|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ryskiel_: in Poland very popular was conventional 1NT in defence bidding, which show 5m+4M|pg||
nt|chmitty: North has a difficult bid in a natural standard system|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  1@c roman, 1N positive but NF|pg||
nt|danilo1: at least 1@C looks like Fiori Romano |pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  24 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: N-S utilizzano il fiori romano corto lungo|pg||
nt|danilo1: * or polish @C|pg||
nt|djneill:  6 sure tricks, 1@s, 2@h, 2@c, 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  @c is likely to come in if 3-3 or @c honor sing/doub|pg||
nt|chmitty: One solution is to adopt a double relay sequence (2@c limited and 2@d game force) in theses situations|pg||
nt|chmitty: these*|pg||
nt|chmitty: everytime the 2@c bid is "free" (not only after a 1NT rebid from opener) you can use it|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@h isn't automatic, but it gives pd a chance to raise on a borderline hand with 3 card @h supt.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chmitty: there it sould go : North 2@c, South 2@d (forced) North 2@h : around 10 Hcp with 5@h|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chmitty: think about it : of course it has a few inconvenients, but so many advantages :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|djneill:  since West led 4th best @s, probably West has no other 4crd suit so no point to finessing round 1 I think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|athene: north is going to get a heart eventually; declarer could never endplay him|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|santyclz: It's certainly becoming popular.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|athene: not enough dummy entries to strip the clubs and get rid of diamonds and then throw him in with a trump|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|danilo1: leave @S once, take second  ... and finess @C8 is inviting|pg||
nt|chmitty: thus you can make a difference between the actual hand and for instance xx D10xxxx Kxx Jx|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|athene: 1@S not really ideal - can be useful to get the sixth heart into it|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: no aces no opening bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: meanwhile calandra piling up the imps|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: 3nt not much fun here on a heart lead, but you might be forced to take the double club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: it's OK to double 2@D just to show cards, but you need to know what your next double means|pg||
nt|athene: opps are sure to bid something in a major|pg||
nt|athene: so when you double THAT, is it penalty or takeout? and is pass forcing?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: at least 500 if south passes this|pg||
