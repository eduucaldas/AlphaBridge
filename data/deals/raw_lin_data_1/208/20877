nt|hedyg:  in their youth LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Birman is one of the slowest players i know at the best of times...|pg||
nt|petergill: Michael Courtney predicted to me in chat that South would make, as West was unaware that his partner had both @SA and @SQ, so he thought he could not cash @CA|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kfay: Hey Phil|pg||
nt|kareno: No really not.|pg||
mb|1N|an|f1|nt|mrt2000: wonder if they'll get to 6@S?|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 5C on club finesse.  in 3NT, defenders can beat it with a spade lead, but south is likely to lead a H, presumably his partner's suit.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: lets see how they instate slam platform|pg||
nt|yuval10: E discarded 6@d and 4@d over the first 2 @c's, i'd say he showed interest in @s|pg||
nt|migry: usually 5+|pg||
mb|2S|nt|migry: i assume they have the methods|pg||
nt|ritong: possible, yes:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: knowing these two, it's more or less a certainty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: So team Gordon is 10 in front by now|pg||
nt|kareno: They need some action hands, not flat 1nt ones.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzpf: not the 3 imps that are displayed|pg||
nt|kfay: I know that N/S play a really 'natural' system, but I'm still surprised they don't have a variety of 2-suited bids available over the strong club opening.  They probably play 1NT = ...|pg||
nt|kfay: minors and X = majors and call that good enough.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south does lead a spade against 3NT, when north plays SA, East must unblock SK to make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: south found the damaging lead, will declarer unblock SK on SA ?  I don't thk so.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrt2000: oh yes  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: the question is how good the slam really is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@D = @s raise - slam invitational|pg||
nt|mrt2000: unless they get to &, that is|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@h asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 4@c = @d shortness|pg||
nt|migry: with the spades 4-1 declarer has some work to do here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 'mildly invitational with not good spades' is now wat R'berg says loudly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: still a make though, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: right, and they need to grab any opportunity in sight.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may need to guess D position to make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: They'll need to defend carefully this hand.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gracelin: yes, to deny declarer any entry to hand.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrt2000: although a @S lead from N would be tricky|pg||
nt|migry: was wondering what would be "normal play" on a @c lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the preempt seems to have stolen the board, 4@H will make NS|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|migry: sry - on a @h lead|pg||
nt|migry: spade is tricky|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to ruff twice on the same side to come up to 12, at first sight|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h+2@c+1@d implies 6 @s tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: who can blame him, but now he is down.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|migry: and work on the hearts- probably hearts 3-3 will make it easy|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|vugraphzpf: 5@h asks for Kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@s says -- Sorry partner - I have none|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|migry: 5@d would have asked for the Q@S|pg||
nt|migry: and the second step confirms all key cards|pg||
nt|mrt2000: he found it|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to lose the lead in @hs no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a second round of trumps would be clumsy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he certainly plans to lead a @h towards QJ asap  the question is, does the timing demand a ruff before that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sorry -- says Rodwell -- and put his cards on the table |pg||
nt|migry: easiest would be to try and ruff 2 clubs in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  achesslike hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gracelin: low spade to SJ may also be a good idea.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d6|nt|ritong: an other solution can be @h hook then Xruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N's 7@S could grow up quickly here|pg||
nt|migry: can't make it now as he will have to give a @h and that little @s7|pg||
nt|kareno: West can be one-suit squeezed if he is not careful.  And yes, that develops at least one spade trick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer cashes all his H winners in order not to be put back to dummy with H.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mrt2000: strange play from dummy at trick 1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: the CJ played by East on 1st round maybe either singleton J or Jx.  Nunn will unblock anyway.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but i would think twice before questioning a rodwell's play:)|pg||
nt|migry: agreed|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it does not consist in second play low|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I wasn't questioning, just onserving  :)|pg||

nt|ritong: i think his play simplified matters with @s9 in north|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am not sre if declarer shud find this play.  I thk he should but remember, this is the 14 days of the long tournament.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|nt|gracelin: West is playing for partner having another club.|pg||
nt|kareno: Dangerous spade discards.|pg||
nt|gracelin: from the auction south is very likely to hold 4-card clubs.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|migry: doesn't look like there were communication problems so not sure why the 8@s was relevant at that point|pg||
nt|ritong: in case of Xruff plan|pg||
nt|mrt2000: agrred, ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and for those of you thinking about an operator error -- forget it -- not this time :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|migry: the point is that while the 8@s was the "wrong" play here, I'm sure that Rodwell had a very good idea about why he's playing it|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: ew lead 4th best it seems|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia gained a small swing by beating both 3H this rom and 4D other room on  3.|pg||
nt|kareno: Easy hand for a change but not what OZ wants.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|vugraphzpf: I didnt hear it |pg||

nt|kareno: Hm, I would deem the south hand good enough for 1nt directly but we shall see.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton threatened a double if Fisher balanced, so he quickly passed|pg||
nt|kareno: Part scores are the heart and soul of long matches.|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's aggressive unless you upgaded the QJxx in spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: The team that does best on those hands usually wins.  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I do.  And I confess to aggressive bidding, especially vulnerable :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrt2000: A@C from E works wonders!|pg||

pc|s9|nt|kareno: And the club fit.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gracelin: agree.  Two teams both with average ages below 30 are fighting for the top places in tis event.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|migry: NS play standard carding with a lot of suit preference|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yuval10: W needs play low @c to signal for @d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the atmosphere is very friendly then :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: right, in fact Israel Junior added 6 imps to ledger on the small hands earlier. |pg||

nt|yuval10: note that S played the 6@c over the 3@c ruff , and not the 2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gracelin: Australian players have an average of 28 years, and Esrael juniors are of course even younger.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I've seen a massive amount of imps generated in the slam department this tournament|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: 3@H = 5card@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: need near ouble dummy defense to beat it, i.e. 2 round of H ended n south and spade shift.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yuval10: so now they might play the @d contract from the right side after all|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But your point well taken.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in this field I guess very few players will pass the East hand.|pg||
mb|3D|an|good hand|mb|p|nt|kfay: Yeah well, the guy I normally play with bids like it's 1970 so I'm a little behind that.|pg||
nt|fluffy: taking 10 balanced as a non invitational range is the proper way to handle IMO|pg||
nt|gracelin: double|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: as long as he doesnt wear a leisure suit at the table|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, we'll see how this plays out.  South doubles with clubs locked up.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on a spade lead it will be easy to insert dummy's S( and get a 2nd spade trick.  But will West dare to stand?|pg||
nt|gracelin: S9|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: where the @s's are defended|pg||
nt|kareno: And perhaps looking for a heart lead.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: although here, north is known a priori with 2@h and at most 3@s|pg||
nt|ritong: which considerably reduces the chance to have the five first @ds to be cashable|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal to win in dummy and start on hearts|pg||
nt|mrt2000: so, is a @S lead not indicates?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indicated|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so, but maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: pard is supposed to hold at least 4, right|pg||
nt|migry: i thought europeans like to lead 3 card suits in these sequences, don't they Henri?|pg||
nt|fluffy: thdefence has to play trumps or diamonds to prevent declarer from discarding a diamong on @cQ and ruffing all spades|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|ritong: on the other hand, better lead your own suits than the inferred ones with pard, most of the time|pg||
nt|kareno: The game of chicken has ended right here :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kareno: With that lead, west should make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: e/w missed their best fit for nine tricks.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yuval10: yet still, a @c lead and a @s switch looks tricky , if you play 6@d. you have to ruff 2 @h's and you have no entry for the K@c in dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: if gosney had avoided the spade lead declarer would still make with help of heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Israel has a carry over of 5 imps going into this match, so they really have 14, not 9. Score will be updated for the next segment.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: i have no idea about that, mig|pg||
nt|gracelin: depend on their areement, but normally, a spade.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps with rubbish|pg||
nt|ritong: tryi_ng to hit pard with entries|pg||
nt|fluffy: but that's just for the overtrick 3@s can't be beaten|pg||
nt|phil: right|pg||
pc|cA|nt|migry: apparently something happened in the other room and the Angelini team gets a 6imps penalty|pg||
nt|yuval10: all academic when they stopped in the sensible contract of 3NT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|migry: and some more action over there|pg||
nt|migry: a mobile phone rang in the other room|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dA|mc|12|nt|phil: the only relevant decision was actually stopping in 3|pg||
nt|kfay: From the schedule it looks like there's not a playoff in this event, so this would be the end of the line for the losing team.  Maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong about ...|pg||

nt|yuval10: possible for E to carry on here|pg||
nt|yuval10: he should know P is in an uncomfortable position|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Nabil Edgtton's debut in the Open team was in May 2011 in the Asia Pacific Championships, coming 2nd to China (Japan 3rd). Edgtton - Gosney had the best datums in the Aussie team ...|pg||
nt|petergill: in that event. |pg||
nt|barnets: west is very min|pg||
nt|hedyg:  yes Barnet, i dont think he has a 4@s bid|pg||
nt|barnets: east has a good hand here|pg||
nt|petergill: Israel by 43 imps with 9 bds to go|pg||
nt|hedyg:  cant he make this?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  if he plays the A@D on the switch after the @H lead?|pg||
nt|barnets: well it goes @HK @D7|pg||

nt|petergill: Who is thinking?|pg||
nt|barnets: he has to guess if north has one or two diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Birman of course :)|pg||
nt|barnets: east thinkin of slam|pg||
nt|ritong: and who would not|pg||
nt|petergill: E thinks W is very short in @h so can visualize possible slam |pg||
nt|ritong: not only that|pg||
nt|yuval10: for all he knows if P bring AK @s AQJ @c and the void in @h it's an easy slam|pg||
nt|hedyg:  but then discount Q@H|pg||
nt|ritong: his hand is excellent  simply @hQ wasted|pg||
nt|petergill: Grand slam maybe?|pg||
nt|barnets: on a diamond switch if it is sing dec must rise - if a doubleton may have to duck it|pg||
nt|ritong: not excluded|pg||
nt|hedyg:  so if Padon had his bid of 4@s..|pg||
nt|barnets: the only doubleton is @D74|pg||
nt|barnets: as all other spots are higher|pg||
nt|petergill: Good 1@H overcall by Paul Gosney, taking his Hamman-like chance to do something a little bit different that might yield some imps|pg||
nt|barnets: so it would be reasonable I think to rise |pg||
nt|ritong: i would dare " obvious"|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Hamman and Meckwell are the world's best at escaping from 40 or 50 imp deficits|pg||
mb|5S|nt|barnets: in other room nunn ducked the diam ond switch and was down on ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: The four card 1@H overcall trapped EW, with East misjudging West's likely @H length, and West being a bit pushy. |pg||
nt|hedyg:  to Edgtton this bidding might imply a problem in @D|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg:  voila|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|petergill: Nunn's play can gain when switch is from Kxxx or xx so is best percentage play against good defenders and these young Israelis sure are good defenders. |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: Still -1, even on this lead|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|petergill: Not realising that North's bid had already won the board, South, trailing by lots, perhaps tried to do something a bit different on opening lead?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Gosney desperately trying to get a ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: who says Q@h is a waist?|pg||
nt|ritong: i did...|pg||
nt|ritong: shame on me|pg||
nt|petergill: North inferred that East must have @DAK from S's lead, and underled to get his ruff! |pg||
nt|hedyg:  i take it back, Yuval|pg||
nt|petergill: If so, would the spade finesse have been taken?|pg||
nt|yuval10: surely doesn't look like a waste now...|pg||
nt|barnets: what spot card lead to n/s play ?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  the @d situation should be clear to Birman from the play of the small @h|pg||
nt|petergill: Good @HQ play by Alon Birman, wide awake. |pg||
nt|barnets: anyone know ?|pg||
nt|barnets: north souths leads ?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  they lead 10 from H109|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|hedyg:  is that what you were asking?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|barnets: if they lead that maybe north could have guessed it but difficult|pg||
nt|petergill: Regarding @HQ play; Knowing partner had 4 cards in the suit, I once underled AQJ92 at Trick 3 through dummy's K106 to get a ruff, but pard had 7543 and declarer's bare 8 won. |pg||
mc|11|nt|hedyg:  well they also lead 10 from 109...|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz asking where all the @S's were, Fisher just says next board|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|kfay: I'm informed that the team that finished higher in the Swiss between the two losing semi-finalists is awarded 3rd place.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|migry: 2@s is a normal opening with 6 clubs|pg||
nt|migry: and 2@d asks|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s= more than minumum - no 4card Major|pg||
nt|ritong: nor 4@h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 3@d looks like E will take command|pg||
nt|yuval10: after he'll ask for aces and see 3 from Partner ( including K@d ) he can count to 13 and bid 7NT with ease|pg||
nt|kfay: Seems like a pretty good system to me.  I've played in two bronze-medal matches in my life (one courtesy of North-South) and I can tell you they're pretty tough to play.  Although|pg||
nt|kareno: Cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: think they want to get this over with quickly|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: 6D for NS.  Declarer can afford to lose a trump unless West lead spade to take away dummy's entry for club discard.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: which certainly was meck's hope at start|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: unclear about the nature of the 3@d bid, but if it showed and extra then it won't be so tough i guess|pg||
nt|kfay: it is nice to go away with something rather than nothing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 3@C is where you'd want to play, I think|pg||
nt|phil: seems hard to keep up your intensity for a 3/4 match|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like a minisplinter and east likes it.|pg||
nt|kareno: For me it's 5 am so I don't object :0|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: Guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|kareno: :) that is|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrt2000: well done|pg||
pc|hK|nt|migry: in  7 angelini passed a 1c opening and everybody was upset |pg||
nt|ritong: he seems to be allergic to fines|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would probably have loved to ask RKCB right away , but was affraid that 4NT over 3@d would be quantitive, as EW didn't agreed on a suit yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another optomistic auction, with red queens onside has a chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact Diamonds are 2-2, so only a spade lead will hold it to six.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|migry: the director was called (again) and not sure what's happenin to that board |pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor the 3@s bid was good in removing all doubts|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yuval10: and there you have it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fluffy: 3@s might be already too high if the defence is sound|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kfay: And based on the Swiss standings the loser of this match will be the 4th-place finisher.  So if they want some hardware they've got to win here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they're juniors, we shouldn't expect anything less from them|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: scored as passout up to that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Birman advising Willenken to lead his ace|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry Karen, I need to go and will leave the table to you.  |pg||
nt|kareno: And naturally, here it is|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks for being here, Patrick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: bye and good lucks eveyone.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yuval10: not even a 3@s bid by South in the OR stopped EW from bidding slam, when West found a 4@d bid|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|migry: so for now board  7 was skipped and they r playing  8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 7 scored as a pass|pg||
nt|migry: which explains the "passed out" score|pg||
nt|migry: the board haven't been played yet|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, let s leave that into director's capable hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Padon asking 'how many you have, 17?'|pg||
nt|yuval10: 15 only|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Birman: 'no, 19'. Padon: I didn't mean points, I meant tricks :-)|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh well too high now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|phil: 4@h makes NS but GL getting in |pg||
nt|fluffy: to get 2 down schwartz has to play a club through to avoid endplay later|pg||

nt|petergill: another chance for some Aussie imps|pg||
nt|ritong: one would think so|pg||

nt|ritong: avoiding slam with two aces off should be possible|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|hedyg:  in the CR the S player knew 2 keycards were missing when he bid the slam|pg||

nt|petergill: things. |pg||
nt|hedyg:  that is a commentators fate Peter :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Presumably Lotan Fisher thought the Aussies would punt the slam on the possible @s hook. I very much doubt that. |pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|3S!|nt|petergill: so Lotan was playing for a flat board by bidding 6@S, maybe. |pg||

nt|phil: unsurprisingly partner has 3433 across - on a bad day its 4=3=3=3|pg||
nt|kareno: No slam.  Presumably south will think he has too many spades to get a penalty worth it.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|migry: a trump at any point would have left declarer with 3 spade losers, the @h ruff and the A@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  1@H would not work|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Not enough controls.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: robert, what is the oz NT range|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: NS discussing system with screen still closed. 4432|pg||
nt|phil: however on a good day, partner has a 5 card suit - but are you really buying the hand? |pg||
nt|kareno: Four can be made with the help of a spade finesse.  We'll watch and see.|pg||
mb|6S|nt|yuval10: 4NT of course would be easy, with 4@s 1@h 3@d and 2@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil: some of the new technology looks pretty interesting as a monitor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they ask BBO operators if there, and players normally call director to watch time|pg||
mb|1H|nt|oosmanb: West keeps getting these long @d hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: overcall or pass with the south hand?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: any good partnership would get to 4@H after a 1@H opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@C= Game forcing -- maybe only 2@cs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (when I'm playing and that happens I get really annoyed why they arent @S )|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: 4 of a major depends on either club onside or hearts breaking.  Neither will happen and without mirrors for the heart suit, game will go down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I don't like to have short spades either, Oosman :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: OR if the 3@H hand also had 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: East starting an escape sequence.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and you have tempo to pitch the @D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but assuming @d lead that's never going to happen|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no beer card when i was a junior, not even a diet cola card|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however isnt there eliminiation in play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 2 rounds of @D and what does West exit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: That would work in hearts but not spades. |pg||
nt|kareno: Pass looks good to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: spade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yeah I'm playing 4@H |pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D some kind of heart raise i suppose, but an unusual one with only 3 trumps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Unless East leads a brilliant @C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||
nt|kareno: A diamond lead will let it make :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|migry: looks like they are playing board  7 now in the other room so ignore the result|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yuval10: they made it through easily after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: all laughing. Willenken says this one is vul, we're ahead in the rubber :-)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzpf: so - Board 7 seems to have been scored as a "draw"|pg||
nt|ritong: ok lets move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's Birman's turn to lead the Ace...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fluffy: or if not passed before, for me 2NT+3@s is forcing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So yeah this will make easily|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: stormy weather|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's not falling for that|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|mrt2000: a simple soul like me would play for @H 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry I meant 5 spades vs 4 spades|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|phil: no strong feelings TBH|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kfay: That's basically how I've played it in the past (4 v. 5 pieces) but since I came up with it on my own I assumed it probably wasn't any good.|pg||
nt|phil: Im not sure you can have all combos of 4 or 5@s, and inv + forcing|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|kareno: Excellent result for Israel.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal|pg||
nt|ritong: makes south 5350 possible|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt need the finesse, specially when its presented free|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: the explanation is 1nt response to 1@H is only semi-forcing, so he does not have the option of 1NT followed by 3@H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oosmanb: elegantly done|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|kfay: Glad to hear you play the same way :P|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: 5@s only because he did not overcall|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|petergill: He had that idea in the days before computer simulations were around|pg||
nt|ritong: feeding pard with wrong info also can cost tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: 6 boards to play australia need 7 per board|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|petergill: Yes, but 1@H - 1@S - 1NT makes declarer's shape fairly closely known|pg||
nt|ritong: so, perhaps on a theoretical plan, some can argue about the efficiency of 4 cards over 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H shows any invit hand, artificial|pg||
nt|ritong: the fazct is, if pard does not know where he lives, he makes mistakes|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|hedyg:  Sabine Auken always leads from 4 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: need spade lead and heart shift to beat 3n|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: by south|pg||
nt|petergill: partner has to bid 2@S then you show your hand type, artificially in some cases|pg||
nt|hedyg:  and Jean Besse told me to do so too|pg||
nt|barnets: that is not likely|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2D|an|majors|mb|p|nt|ritong: what would you do here?|pg||
nt|ritong: show both majors if possible, then insist on @ss?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: get to 4@S, I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c = @s-suit AND either @h or @c|pg||
nt|migry: either show spade shortness or clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: I think south will pass.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mrt2000: in fact, I suspect it takes a @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c was probably a sort of "Drury", and now W is in with a @h and a minor bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7NT in the OR as well, good match we have so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2NT would've been a weaker hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: cue bid to show max raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: hopefully they have the tools to find the 503 heart fit here|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 4nt now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: now S would probably bid 4@s with max and @d support|pg||
nt|phil: 5-3|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, let's say that I would have passed 2@d.  By the way I play 2nt in this auction as a cuebid and game invitational.|pg||
nt|kareno: This will work out just fine for n/s|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, was away.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kareno: They should stop in 2@h, the limit of the hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: np - welcome back :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrt2000: possibly|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oooops|pg||
nt|ritong: north has not passed yet|pg||
nt|ritong: by large|pg||
nt|migry: what wd u do with north?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why would N remove the X?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fluffy: looks like they do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Im curious why West didnt dbl 2@c|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: looks like berkowitz wrote down> 5crd Major|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W, I'm sure, probably have some discretion as to whether they can call an 8-cout a bad 8 (and bid 1@d) or a good 8 (and bid something else).  This is definitely a bad 8.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fisher has inferred his partner has spades stopped as gosney bid hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does that show something else|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if bidding again, I would prefer 4NT from S|pg||
nt|kareno: Again, west is competing for the all-important partscore.  Matches are so often won by an accumulation of part-score swings.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: perhaps its take out of @H's, which he doesn't have without @D's|pg||
nt|kareno: South will make many notrumps on this hand.  Three anyway assuming e/w cash.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia has some chance to pick up swing on the 3D +3, and 6S -1 hands, but probably not enough to overcome their deficit.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|migry: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = doesn't want @h lead i guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: transfering to berkowitz sounds ugly, but I think its just part of the system|pg||
nt|kareno: That could be.  Depends on their agreements.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: A@S on and a @h ruff in dummy is all he needs|pg||
nt|kareno: There are still five boards unplayed but it is asking for a Nickell-type ending to win it for OZ.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fluffy: they probably just play the same when 1NT is weak|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont usually thank dummy but this one is worth a special thanks, just perfect|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kfay: I guess they must play something like 3@d=min 5@H, 3@H = max 5@H, 3@s = min 5@S, 3N = max 5@s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz has left the room, so we'll wait a couple mins|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yuval10: possible misunderstandning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: NS chatting 'you should have two without @SQ|pg||
nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||
nt|migry: for @d and @s|pg||
nt|migry: with the Q@d being a specific king|pg||
nt|yuval10: anyways they got one level too high|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kareno: The diamond lead could be a problem for west.  He needs to duck it or lose a promotion in clubs.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|fluffy: be careful with all thos transfers, some ladies ended up in -3400 in the venice cup RR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: EW referring to the dutch ladies, with the 4@Hxx for 3400|pg||
nt|oosmanb: notice the small/10@h play to keep communication|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
nt|migry: so 5@s doubled looks normal|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, it would push EW t|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have 5@s and a stiff @h -- if thats helps you ---says Rodwell|pg||
nt|mrt2000: to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Rosenberg answars -- that doesnt help me a lot |pg||
nt|phil: pass of 4@d is useful as  - I dont have a diamond control - you play it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kareno: Of course, declarer may ruff high on the next diamond and finesse in clubs to neutralize north's ten.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: going to be testing though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kareno: (actually the clubs are good enough to stand the pressure.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That was a loser on loesr play, but what about the next @D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: 1 down and 10 imps for the juniors|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kfay: 4@d was obviously a transfer and it led to a pretty interesting situation about how to handle the double.  There's a famous hand played by Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss a year ago ...|pg||
nt|kfay: where they had a Texas transfer auction where Brad redoubled, intending it to say 'you play 4M.' Fred passed and I think the final contract was 4@HXX down a lot.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: Ruff high, hearts to ruff in dummy and hope for 3-2 clubs.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Or an inspired @c finesse which would also work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so wont go wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher asked Schwartz to overruff..|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes indeed.|pg||
nt|kareno: :)|pg||

nt|petergill: 7S is worth considering, from a biased observer|pg||
nt|barnets: but e/w not bid any hearts|pg||

nt|ritong: noone can suspect you to be unbiased, peter dear:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: unless i miss something...|pg||
nt|barnets: well that needs spades 3-2 plus some help|pg||

nt|kfay: And redouble would show a hand that's willing to compete if the opponents take a sacrifice.  Presumably a hand that strong wouldn't mind if responder HAS to play 4M.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher said @S are 3-3, Berkowitz, that's not fun :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Israel juniors picked up 9 for their 6@d effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Yeah well that particular hand was definintely a pretty surprising result.  I think it was in the semifinals or finals of the USBF versus the Fleisher team.|pg||
nt|phil: precisionesque 2@d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yuval10: a lot of action in the OR where NS already bids to the making 3NT, but EW bided them out of it|pg||
nt|kareno: 6 of a major easy to bid - seven is there.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: berkowitz can envision 12 tricks if partner has a perfect hand, but soon he will see there is no luck today|pg||
nt|gracelin: but not 7S, |pg||
mb|3D|nt|phil: would have to be a remarkable minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Maybe exclusion blackwood??  Does that give enough information?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|oosmanb: Not too many tricks for declarer here|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: it is|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 10 imps will quickly come back to the Gordon team|pg||
nt|kareno: No, a spade raise would have been more useful.  (or a pass by east over 1@c)|pg||
nt|kareno: Blocking play by declarer.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South has an entry, so he'll cash AK@H and use their signalling method to show @D|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzpf: E still thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks normal, but this time dummy does not have the required stopper in unbid suit, and 5@D was easy make|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: or that :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: duck is superior.. partner doesnt have to discard twice for no reason|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrt2000: well bid NS|pg||
nt|kfay: I think the usual explanation for the 2@D bid is something like "4415 minus a card".  So you could be (43)15 or 4405, etc.|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack of clubs I assume now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kareno: Teach me to assume :)|pg||

nt|gracelin: East was unlucky to choose a 3D rebid.  If he had bid 3H over 2S and get a raise, the exclusion RKC may get the job done.|pg||
nt|kareno: South made a good overcall to cost them space.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East does suggest Heart as trumps, but doubt West will accept.|pg||
nt|kareno: And you are quite right.  When spades are raised, then hearts were out of the picture in east's mind.|pg||
nt|kareno: They actually can make seven with the friendly lie in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: Except for the bad spade break :(|pg||
nt|kareno: (it's very late here)|pg||
nt|kareno: 7@h does fetch.  They definitely need swings so perhaps this is the time for a shot.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't thk they will bid the grand, just 6H or 6S.  Both will make easily|pg||
nt|gracelin: West just cannot that much in East hand after a 1S opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: cannot expect|pg||

nt|fluffy: oh right @d7 must be from A875 sorry|pg||
nt|kfay: I know what you mean, but the Ace was marked on this hand.  Wouldn't be so if the @d10 and the @d2 were switched, I guess.  Maybe Schwartz got lucky.  Or maybe Fisher would have ...|pg||

nt|gracelin: draw two round of trump then test spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I think it is a good exercise sometimes for a very slow player to play hands fast  - not in a world championship perhaps but just to do it. at other times.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and glad to see the second spade ruffed.|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart to the queen and ruff club when they both follow would be my thinking.  Then spade to hand to draw last trump and proceed from there.|pg||
nt|kareno: That is surely how I would play 7|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe, but in six that line is dangerous if Hearts are 4-1 even spades are 3-2.|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: how's 3NT NS|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt my guess here.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|yuval10: here NS in the OR did well to bid to a marginal game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kfay: Personally I would have just blasted 4@H with Berkowitz's hand but he has way more experience with the 2@d than I, and I'm sure he had some really good reasons.|pg||
nt|phil: or - transfer the club threat to E and N is guard squeezed - only if declarer would have unblocked the @s8 earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2@d = raise in @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@d = mixed raise in @c|pg||
nt|fluffy: fisher has a double fit!|pg||
nt|phil: of sorts LOL|pg||
nt|kfay: Likely he was looking for a good slam.|pg||
nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: although he might have checked out with 4@h once partner shows a min|pg||
nt|fluffy: passive leads would make 4@h a make, but there are no apssive leads on this hand, and whatever lead but a trump if continued ends up beating 4@h|pg||
nt|kfay: I don't think it's really emphasized enough that this 2@H bid really shows a very nice hand opposite Fisher's pass.  I've seen a lot of 2@Hs thrown out just because opener is 5-4 ...|pg||
nt|kfay: and that is not a good way to play.  You'll get a lot of punishment.  That's why Fisher's thinking here because I'm sure he knows his partner is reliable.|pg||
nt|phil: especially when partner is already prone to respond light|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kfay: This is another good example of how the 4-4 plays better than the 5-3 since a losing @d can be pitched on the long spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's fine - three hearts and a diamond to lose on a heart lead.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@D not bad but failing. 3NT always makes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher: before he puts dummy down, please dont make to much!|pg||
nt|phil: every time I say that my partner doesnt :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I can see that Hans/Nunn still play their normal game at this stage.  They could take chances in few hands to create swing, like a double here, but they chose not to.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oosmanb: 3NT from South now|pg||

pc|s2|nt|mrt2000: no chance here I suspect|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this auction 2@H likely not natural although forcing, so fisher choose 3@H to get the shape across immediately|pg||

nt|mrt2000: likely 2|pg||
nt|migry: 2@s would have made, 3@c rates to go 2 down as it will be difficult to guess the 10@c|pg||
nt|ritong: when west doubled 1@c, declarer will have trouble picking them right|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Oz will have to hope the board is duplicated in the Open room|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|oosmanb: Ok I've been told they are current World Junior champs, Euro junior champs AND won Silver in World mind sports junior pairs!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2@c should be 2-suiter , interesting to see that South didn't double for "support"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 6@C happens to make, but not a great contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Wow!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz content with his 800 on the previous board, staying out of trouble here..|pg||
nt|kareno: Discreet pass by north.  But 4@h is a decent contract (and can be made with mirrors if no club lead.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oosmanb: 4@h not a bad contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But he didnt like his K@S and so didnt dbl|pg||
nt|kareno: This is likely to be down one and could be a pickup if n/s bid 4@h in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he probably didn't favour the colours|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|kfay: Double partscore swings are really underrated at IMPs, usually.  People talk about gameswings and not going for numbers but the 6s and 7s available really add up.|pg||
nt|kfay: Probably not underrated at this table, I'm sure.  Just in everyday tournaments.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: if the declarer will take top @s in the 2nd round and plays @h, he'll due to make his contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Pd didnt have enough to even neg dbl 1@S |pg||
nt|kareno: Another possible pass of a negative double :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: should we try a " cooperative" 3@h?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|yuval10: E can play J@d in the 2nd round also, but that'd be tough|pg||
nt|yuval10: and of course declarer can still make his contract by attacking @c then|pg||
nt|yuval10: he'll have to guess which Ace does E holds - A@h or A@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sontag when he saw @SA, hmm, |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|migry: 5@c should show good trumps|pg||
nt|migry: they don't play 'fast approach"|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I agree with the pass|pg||
nt|kareno: He has a one club opening without the spade king!|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h8|nt|kareno: Good point, Oosman.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kfay: Looking at E/W leading agreements I'm not sure what the @cQ was all about.|pg||
nt|kfay: They lead A from AK below the 5-level unless shifting to a singleton...|pg||
nt|kfay: A friend of mine once told me of his idea that from AKQ ace should ace for attitude, king for count, and queen for suit preference.  But there's not really any way Berkowitz would ...|pg||
nt|kfay: know that Sontag held AKQ here (except for the presence of his jack).|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no advantage to transfers when responder if bidding game is the stronger hand |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ritong: the right spot might easily be 3NT when pard has somethink like @h QX  i m a bit surprised at chris' leap|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: 1nt 9-12 1/2nd seat at favorable vuls|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kfay: If Sontag was expecting to receive a s/p signal on the @cQ then Berkowitz erred by not playing the J at trick one.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kfay: In fact he probably should have played the jack.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: On the assumption that with 5@Hs a neg dbl can be even lighter (you can bid 2@H over 2m as a weak 5 card suit), he really didnt think 4@H would be any good. |pg||

nt|barnets: I will get extra 2 hours sleep in morning|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|barnets: as will many other specs who have enjoyed the great show|pg||
nt|petergill: Very nice slam by Sartaj Hans and Tony Nunn|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  wots sleep?|pg||
nt|yuval10: this 1NT will make it very hard for EW to bid slam|pg||
nt|hedyg:  so this is now the very last board of this competition and the exciting 2 weeks we have spent with Vugraph..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N  9-12 "balanced"  1st/2nd seat favorable|pg||
nt|petergill: Both teams (of six players) have played their top four throughout the Grand Final, as was expected. |pg||
nt|hedyg:  1st thanks go to very capable operators we have had!|pg||
nt|barnets: and thanks to Roland for organising all commentating- now with voice|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|petergill: Dror Padon is 22, Alon Birman 25, Ron Schwartz 25, Lotan Fisher 22 and the other two are 20 and 21 - sorry that I've forgotten their names|pg||
nt|hedyg:  to Peter, Barnet , Henri and Yuval for guiding us through these boards..|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: Gal Gerstner ( 20 ) and Moshe Meyucas ( 21 )|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1NT 9-12 balanced or semi-bal or whatever you like, really|pg||
nt|hedyg:  to the WBF and the NBB for sharing this event with us, especially to Jakob Hop who was instrumental in organising the broadcasts|pg||
nt|ritong: the (slightly offshape) weak NT does not help EW here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|hedyg:  and to our loyal specs for joining, we hope you enjoyed these 2 weeks as much as we did|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
mc|12|nt|barnets: yes tks all|pg||

nt|curtis: \|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, it shows like @c HHxxx and out|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and a partscore|pg||
nt|ritong: hello curtis|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2nd half of the Quarter finals is playe tomorrow at 10.00 am here in Veldhoved -- guess its 4.00am in New York|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board, Parimatch will continue to the semi finals of the transnationals.|pg||
nt|yuval10: entering the last board of the first haw, Israel holds a slim lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board of this Semi-Final, the final should start at 18.20 local time, thats 35 min from now, I believe we are a bit late on shedule..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: And a @c lead set up a ruff in 4@H too|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: indeed|pg||
nt|kfay: In that case maybe he should have played the J also.|pg||
nt|fluffy: padon made 4@h on the other table the match is very close|pg||
nt|kareno: With the natural trump trick (unless first lead small from dummy)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (that's if you can drop singleton A without wasting an honour)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: David Berkowits and Alan Sontag are due up for the Gordon team.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Robert Stephens who like all the operators did an excellent job|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in trumps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzpf: remind all of you, Israel has 7 imp less!|pg||
nt|kfay: But clearly it's at least somewhat undiscussed so I'm not sure why he'd expect all of this.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so all in all, not a bad board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: This will stretch for 6@h if e/w have the mechanism for it.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|migry: will it be a @s partscore or a @d one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: DBL is a transfer to 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|yuval10: can the Israeli team hold up and "kill" yet another giant? we'll know right away. i believe the 2nd half was due to start 15:40 local time|pg||
nt|kareno: I would not pass with that east hand.  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: "garbage" stayman|pg||
nt|oosmanb: auto 2@S for me, strictly to play|pg||
nt|kareno: South might pass 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I never pass with a six-card suit and a little transferable value|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: when will be my lunch break then? (and the players')|pg||
nt|oosmanb: didnt he want to end up in 2@S, if there was no interference from opp anyway|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: typical auction would be 1@c-1@S-1any-2@S ppp|pg||
nt|kareno: That was quick :)  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher is laughing at the bidding..|pg||
nt|kareno: Very efficient auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he's considering using the full 1 hour left to find a lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kfay: I don't think the 'error' was really either E's or W's fault.  You kind of win those battles in the off season more than at the table.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: to the WBF for letting BBO broadcast these events, to the spectator, and to my co-commentators (hey thats me)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kareno: I'll be using it for some sleep :)  |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and DBL = "Clarify" partner|pg||
nt|mrt2000: as predicited   :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can ask Bas to bring you some Marc :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrt2000: predicted|pg||
nt|migry: :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: another israel juniors had this same sequence yesterday|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|fluffy: the 3@h bidder had @hAK|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: thanks very much for our operator Marc for a splendid job, also to Migry who joined me over this broadcasting|pg||
nt|fluffy: and they played a silly 5@h with @hAK opposite 9xxxx|pg||
nt|fluffy: now they all know 3@h doesn't show real support I guess|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kfay: This hand kind of brings up an interesting topic for me and that's what S should do if his hand were AKQx Kxx Qx xxxx|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fluffy: this lead will lead to -460 quickly|pg||
nt|kfay: Well I guess since 1@H could be 4 maybe this is a poor example.|pg||
nt|kfay: But say it guaranteed 5 I believe it's best to bid 2@C in response to 1@H with that shape (4324 and a game force) simply to have a more efficient auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe the final 32 boards of this event start at 10:00 tomorrow local time, can you confirm that Robert|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: looks like 10:30, so as to run alongside the other 3 events. They def start at 10:30|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Bas is off today|pg||
nt|kareno: Claim before you make a mistake!!|pg||
mc|12|nt|kareno: He heard me :)|pg||
nt|kareno: The other table is well behind ours so you can go over there now.  Looks very much like Mazel Tov to Israel :)|pg||
