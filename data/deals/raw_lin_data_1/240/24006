mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: GOOD MORNING ALL OF YOU|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  A tricky problem for E. I am sure we would all bid 3N, but 4@s is a much better contract|pg||

nt|prasun1966: ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he might solve it. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Or rather, perhaps he should. He knows declarer has at least three spades, two clubs, and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|henryb:  as winners. So the only hope is that declarer has the stiff @hK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was counting tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mackulky:  easy 9 tricks for Raju |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mackulky:  EW can get ypto 4@S |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|prasun1966: E and W r playing Strong @C  while NS r playing 2/1|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|henryb:  North is likely to play this in 2N or 3N after opening 2N in fourth seat|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|henryb:  After two rounds of @d, he has 3@s, 1@h, 1@d and 1@c|pg||
nt|prasun1966: N will have to believe the @S10 to make this contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  He needs three more tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of these can come from the fourth spade, but he still needs two tricks from somewhere|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mackulky:  both play and defense will be interesting|pg||
nt|mackulky:  but I believe Declerer should prevail in the end|pg||
nt|figo:  E hand better than just a sign off |pg||

nt|nkgupt: texans fast loosing the ground|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mackulky:  with no count in Spades tough return for Ajay|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, just aaw for myself that 4@s is down|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mackulky:  third spade|pg||
nt|mackulky:  to kill the winner|pg||

nt|sandipdang:  5! also needs accurate defence|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|prasun1966: To take the quick tricks against opps' slam is most common gesture of almost everybody:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Rajesh also did not find the heart play on Bd 57. He gave himself less chance, though, by grabbing the first spade|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pappoo: this gives away the position however on a neutral lead when declarer plays the A or K of trumps a nd North drops the 9 or 10   it gives a losing option to west|pg||
