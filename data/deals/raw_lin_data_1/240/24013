mb|1D|nt|mackulky:  The same line up for Manyawar |pg||
nt|henryb:  I'll comment for a while if you would like|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: GOOD MORNING ALL OF YOU|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  A tricky problem for E. I am sure we would all bid 3N, but 4@s is a much better contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||

nt|figo:  decl will be pleased |pg||
nt|jain: hmm friendly lead nd made|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  better than friendly - the only lead to allow the contract to make|pg||
nt|jain: fans of texan aces overjoyed for sure:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: TEST|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  I don't know how to get there|pg||

nt|prasun1966: 2@S here is 4-4 minor opening hand |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  Now a tricky problem for S.|pg||
nt|prasun1966: ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he might solve it. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Or rather, perhaps he should. He knows declarer has at least three spades, two clubs, and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|henryb:  as winners. So the only hope is that declarer has the stiff @hK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was counting tricks|pg||
nt|thak: hi|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mackulky:  easy 9 tricks for Raju |pg||
nt|thak: declarer probably wd've been happier to be in 3N|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Pd ship has been changed for both team  DSM has brought Arun and Suhas and Manas and Subir for Rail|pg||
pc|h4|nt|r_tibre: hoping for a more interesting set of deals, and more lively action|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|nt|thak: @DA and a @S he needs to get it right|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|prasun1966: difficult for S to take @SA and Play @HA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  And if declarer has only the stiff @hK. he will have five diamonds, therefore ...|pg||
nt|thak: will need to guess anyway|pg||
nt|thak: with @D J not surviving|pg||
nt|thak: not knowing the 4-1 break, he's likely to play @CA , T to J planning to ruff @H 9 and a @S pitch on @D J|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzhz: PLAY WAS DELAYED DUE TO APEAL|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|nt|r_tibre: gm all, thanks Pramod|pg||
mb|p|nt|r_tibre: Rail off to a good start|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mackulky:  EW can get ypto 4@S |pg||
nt|psyck: other room seems to be having some connection problems|pg||
mb|1H|nt|thak: this was strange, if laltu held @SA, he'd surely 've held onto winner @D|pg||
mb|d|nt|prasun1966: E and W r playing Strong @C  while NS r playing 2/1|pg||
nt|r_tibre: tough choice over 3@D.... no alternative seems really good|pg||
mb|2H|nt|thak: @S problem was resolved for suhas, and he still got it wrong..|pg||
mb|p|nt|thak: imaginative raise by arun|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe operator will let us know if 2@d showed just @s or something more|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  North is likely to play this in 2N or 3N after opening 2N in fourth seat|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s likely as @h raise|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb:  After two rounds of @d, he has 3@s, 1@h, 1@d and 1@c|pg||
nt|prasun1966: N will have to believe the @S10 to make this contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  He needs three more tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of these can come from the fourth spade, but he still needs two tricks from somewhere|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mackulky:  both play and defense will be interesting|pg||
nt|mackulky:  but I believe Declerer should prevail in the end|pg||
nt|figo:  E hand better than just a sign off |pg||
nt|psyck: anyway normal contract reached|pg||

pc|s5|nt|henryb:  the only place is hearts, which is possible if the @hK is onside|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Last hand also S led @HQ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  but he needs two entries to dummy|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|mackulky:  and @C hons placed favourably|pg||

nt|henryb:  Back up, operator|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 45 IMPS diff but not impossible in 14brds|pg||

nt|psyck: this time Inv+ in @c|pg||
nt|figo:  fine |pg||
nt|psyck: lot of work to be done|pg||
nt|psyck: inv+ = invitational hand or better|pg||
mb|2S|nt|r_tibre: S has to be careful on a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: Laltu in deep thought I guess ,with 14hcp with him,all bidding.but seems they o\board|pg||
nt|thak: declarer has no entry to table, so will have to concede an open @C trick alongwith a @H, a@S and 2 @Ds|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mackulky:  well played N|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: is a phantom anyway|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes indeed|pg||
nt|henryb:  but a trick is 5 imps in a close match|pg||
nt|nkgupt: texans fast loosing the ground|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: Good push to 3@D|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mackulky:  with no count in Spades tough return for Ajay|pg||

pc|s2|nt|mackulky:  third spade|pg||

nt|mackulky:  had Raju played a trump at trick 2 and Ajay retun Spade |pg||
nt|r_tibre: yes|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|prasun1966: To take the quick tricks against opps' slam is most common gesture of almost everybody:)|pg||

nt|r_tibre: EW not a regular partnership.. very few in this match are :)|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|subhranp:  hi prasun|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  5@C makes folks unless @S ace is underled and @H comes back - unlikely|pg||
nt|r_tibre: S is the sponsor of the DSM team... EW play for DSM normally... required to rep Rail here as they are employed with Rail|pg||
nt|r_tibre: which raises at least a few question marks over the format of the trials... and surely not for the first/last time|pg||
mb|2H|nt|figo:  good morning all |pg||
nt|prasun1966: They need Oxygen|pg||

mb|p|nt|mackulky:  NS|pg||
nt|alok_daga: a 400 for E\W but will it be bid?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|r_tibre: Ind. Railways has invested a lot in promoting sports in India over the decades, and have a strong presence in bridge too|pg||
mb|d|nt|figo:  I predict a very close match ; psyck , ur guess ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mackulky:  a game for EW |pg||
nt|jain: hi henry|pg||
nt|subhranp:  likely to compete to 3s|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mackulky:  this is the second segment of the 6 Knock out|pg||
nt|jain: hi prasun|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|nkgupt: this might put them in a bit of a trouble|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@hX is not so easy to beat|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer is likely to make an overtrick|pg||
nt|jain: another flat br|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 1N a limit raise in @Cs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  and Texan are in an early lead|pg||
nt|prasun1966: dbl can yield 500 for Texans|pg||
nt|jain: N may not convert nd choose 3s|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Y difficult for N to convert|pg||
nt|subhranp:  hi all hi sandip|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  hi subbs|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 4 on as cards are... will they get there?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: N has certainly shown life in this auction.. S not looking at too many losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: from the face it looks like he will easily roll home but what happens on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: transfer to clubs they play tr on 1sp o\c|pg||
pc|cK|nt|figo:  1H relay here |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, that would be a fair prediction with tese players|pg||
nt|figo:  1C is art strong |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mackulky:  shud be home with the evn break in @H|pg||
nt|jain: but for sure a very shabby opening by E.precision players just open on any 11 counts:(|pg||
pc|c7|nt|subhranp: hello all|pg||
nt|mackulky:  kaizad got to the best lead|pg||
nt|mackulky:  hello|pg||
nt|mackulky:  i guess board 45 on other table being played out tillthe end :)|pg||
nt|subhranp:  that lead will sell|pg||
nt|alok_daga: a v heavy 2hrts.14 facing 9 a 3nt .defence will be tested|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Few and may be nobody is so brave to deffend a partsocre DBL against a player like Anilji:)|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Sandeep has not done justice to his hand|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 5@C was makeable for EW|pg||
nt|r_tibre: i think both being alittle tentative... bound to be in a not so regular partnership|pg||
nt|alok_daga: his p has at best 2spades after the 2sp xle so where r the losers?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: But what welse W could have done|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 3@H-3@S?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: He has transferred and said 2@S also|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Rajesh let me crrect u.these 2 play as a pair for Rail for the last 2years|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mackulky:  no return seems interesting for Venkatesh may be he will @S|pg||
nt|r_tibre: how many times in a year?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: in most major tourneys, have seen Sandeep partner Kaustabh Nandi during this period|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|figo:  trsf here is not so much abt whom plays in spades ( S has already bid 1S ) |pg||
nt|figo:  Who*|pg||
nt|figo:  but abt describing full hand finally |pg||
pc|s2|nt|figo:  3S is super accept |pg||
nt|figo:  2H was transfer to 2S anyway |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|r_tibre: i think i wud not pass 3@D itself.. 3@D - pass puts pressure on self later on|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jain: spade leads is almost impossible but|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|nt|jain: makes 1|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: & 1n a bal strong hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mackulky:  -2 looks a cheap save as NS cud make 3 NT |pg||
nt|jain: texan aces building on,this too will add a few more imps nd time running out for manyawar|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mackulky:  now quick claim for 11|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mackulky:  but with EW each holding two suits 7 carders shud be a push |pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb:  eventually West will get endplayed to give declarer his seventh trick|pg||

nt|subhranp:  6s possible here for NS|pg||
nt|figo:  or max 1 down |pg||
nt|prasun1966: 2@H? = weak i think|pg||
nt|r_tibre: yes, @C lead normal.... i personally prefer 2@H over 1@H.. makes it more difficult for EW|pg||
nt|r_tibre: S has a clear 3@H bid in my books|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sunsamvar: a kib suggests that walmart is a bigger employer than Indian Railways... but i am sure that IR has a better bridge team|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 5@D on it seems.. do u reach it? or do opps help u push up to it?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: But here E cannot keep himself abstained from bidding|pg||
mb|3H|nt|prasun1966: 4@S cannot make  If Ajay can find out a @C lead and continuation|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Yes in favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 4@S has play i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  another part score|pg||
nt|jain: another x or 3nt|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  yes - timing important|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 4@S is makeable  it shows apparently|pg||
nt|r_tibre: the see-saw battle continues... Rail wrest 6 back|pg||
nt|r_tibre: they bid the cold 4@H on 32|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Difficult for E to enter here|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: HE IS THINKING HARD|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Still it is difficult to bid 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: interesting hand|pg||
nt|mackulky:  aggressive action by Venkatesh wins |pg||
mb|p|nt|r_tibre: he may even give NS a few unfreindly glances... wow, a brave dbl|pg||
nt|prasun1966: :(|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  3@c makes also|pg||
nt|figo:  with 5332 and 3 card M fit , many raise major with 3 cards |pg||
pc|s3|nt|r_tibre: will he push further?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: I guessed that Laltu would|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jain: 4c seems par|pg||
nt|jain: 3s makes 4c 1 dwn|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think E should bid 2@c over 1@s|pg||
nt|subhranp:  good lead, this will save a trick|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2@C must be gf checkback\|pg||
nt|figo:  and check back avalable to pd but here not needed |pg||
nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Hi|pg||
nt|r_tibre: Hi Daga jee, wc|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|alok_daga: hi Prasun,Rajesh|pg||
nt|r_tibre: Sumit arguably has the best table presence among indian bridge players, laltu showing us he is not far behind|pg||
nt|prasun1966: On a @S lead, 3@S is even tough  i think|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|subhranp: although declarer has 6 losers, he can still make if he can avoid east from getting on lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jain: i feel he will bid 4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|prasun1966: They donot play 2 way checkback, it seem|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well bid|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: best contract and rightsided too|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  Ajay should cash the @hA to see what signal partner gives, then switch back to @c|pg||
nt|henryb:  If E had a doubleton @h and the @s8 he could beat 3@s|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  after 4 @C thers no stopping keyzad - well bid aces|pg||
nt|figo:  carding udca for EW|pg||
nt|subhranp:  dont agree with the 4d bid here of South|pg||
pc|dA|nt|subhranp:  requires careful play to make this|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  will make|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|prasun1966: 4@S cannot make|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3nt ie... 4@S shd be down|pg||
nt|psyck: some prefer more shape, & most have means of clarifying on what the raise was on|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|alok_daga: as I remarked 2 Prasun in pvt trump lead in the auctions create a lot of problems|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sandipdang:  @s k then diamonds?|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  probably best line|pg||
nt|subhranp:  he has to figure out the best line of play for spade 3-1|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  or ruff a club and a heart in dummy?|pg||
nt|alok_daga: these|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mackulky:  4@H is not clearcut for EW |pg||
nt|prasun1966: Surprising  with only 11 and 2cards @S  no point of pulling the 3NT into 4@S|pg||
nt|psyck: here with those majors, it was a clear raise for me|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mackulky:  but NS did well to buy it in 2@S|pg||
nt|arunbapat: I do not understand insistance of playing the hand in 4S.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess that is hard to see|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Now 4 md|pg||

nt|figo:  no real ' action ' for kibs :)|pg||
nt|psyck: this is just the preamble :)|pg||
nt|psyck: enough board to follow & surely these players will liven it up|pg||
nt|figo:  anyway , I dont rate these players to bid with lot of ' masala ' |pg||
nt|figo:  they will be more on ' steady ' side , atleast for now |pg||
nt|figo:  where r they ?|pg||
nt|psyck: the different styles of bidding & judgement will be enough to produce some swings soon|pg||
pc|cT|nt|r_tibre: agree.. declarer has little choice other than going after @Cs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|subhranp: yes but EW atleast should have found a way to compete further|pg||
nt|mackulky:  the lead of texan Aces narrows down |pg||
nt|sandipdang:  this works too|pg||
nt|subhranp:  North could have bid 5c on the way to 5d|pg||
nt|r_tibre: i may even venture 3@H-p-p-3@S in case p dbled w 5 @ss|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

pc|s9|nt|prasun1966: @S shift could have done well to get -1  now it makes|pg||
nt|pappoo: 3NT and 5 of either minor makes because of the DK being onside|pg||
nt|subhranp:  now makes 6|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|mackulky:  It still is a close one with only 20 IMps seperating the two and three more sessions to go after this |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|nkgupt: need to ruff 1@d low and last high|pg||
nt|psyck: this takes away entry to @c & trumps don't break, there may be some DD way to make still|pg||
nt|thak: hi|pg||
nt|thak: shd make easy, suhas's not having a @S helps, he can't play a 2nd round|pg||

nt|prasun1966: ..|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: @S return was not the best from both sides|pg||

nt|offthebend: playing D to be 3-3 does not help |pg||
nt|vugraphzhy: board 55 cashed|pg||
nt|offthebend: he should Play S to have long spades and take the finesse |pg||

nt|pappoo: so a possible swing to railways|pg||
nt|thak: that was a very unexpected and uncharacteristic line of play|pg||
nt|psyck: at least we are getting swingly boards now, one way or the other|pg||
nt|thak: any time finesse is going to be advantageous, ruff works equally well|pg||
nt|figo:  that was ' reverse swing ' though |pg||
nt|subhranp:  railways have bid 6d on B21 and picked up 13 imps|pg||
nt|alok_daga: brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|arunbapat: I do not get why RV did not play CA and back..|pg||

mb|p|nt|jain: same contract here too|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 6@s is a decent one 75%  suppose|pg||
nt|pappoo: 4H is a possible make here|pg||
nt|thak: finesse  could only lose and never gain|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: or even duck the 1st @C arunji|pg||
nt|arunbapat: that would have made situaton clear to N and even to RV|pg||
mb|3C|nt|prasun1966: No slammish hand is noticed as yet  except deal no 5|pg||
nt|subhranp:  this could end in a quiet 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: going to be unlucky for NS|pg||
nt|thak: another slam?|pg||
nt|thak: can make 7 dbl dummy on HT hook and minor suit sqz|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 4@S allowed on 35 in OR.. so match level with 49 deals to score|pg||
mb|3D|nt|subhranp: should be a comfortable 3nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: opening hand facing opening hand for n/s... will they reach game ?|pg||

mb|3S|an|SMOLAN|mb|p|nt|jain: shd b 1 dwn on the std lead of @C K|pg||
nt|mackulky:  with Railways and DSM already prequalified as the two Semi finalists , they have to find two more Semi finalists from the remaining teams i.e. Manyawar , Texan Aces , Formidables and Poddar Developers|pg||
nt|figo:  will last deal be playing on laltu's mind?|pg||
nt|thak: he'll really need to struggle to mess this one up :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzhz: PLAY GOING ON HOW CAN I TELL?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: nd shd suffer the same fate|pg||
nt|mackulky:  may be unless he takes a trump reduction line but apparantly there is no clue for that |pg||
nt|jain: rana will play heart after winning hoping to ruff the third heart nd also hoping trumps to behave|pg||
nt|jain: usually rana is a very quick player|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: Yes it is:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as per one kib state of the match sud stop them from bidding a 75% slam:)|pg||
nt|subhranp:  meanwhile texans have gained 11imps on B49 as IR pair missed the slam in the other room|pg||
nt|figo:  predict at your own risk sandeep :)|pg||

nt|nkgupt: mb not to make but for make / save for -1|pg||
nt|figo:  arun must be saying sorry to suhas |pg||
nt|psyck: surprised at the play, Arun is normally very good|pg||
nt|thak: perhaps arun happy to settle for -50 given that he doesn't see 4@H being defended..|pg||
nt|figo:  ok friends , gtg now , happy viewing , bye |pg||
nt|nkgupt: ruffing low hardly made any sense:)|pg||
nt|prasun1966: deal no 37  Sandip and Banerjee is in 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: BREAK HERE|pg||
nt|prasun1966: ok|pg||
nt|alok_daga: brd no 42 a biggie-not seen a 12 trick hand in a v long time|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 4@S-1 wud have been good |pg||
nt|r_tibre: 41 seems a + for rail|pg||
nt|r_tibre: match still too close to call... ur picks alok n prasun?|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Personally i think Rail will prevail|pg||
nt|r_tibre: i wud say 3:2 for rail|pg||
nt|alok_daga: this set had N\Shere been more inspired they cud have developed a gud lead|pg||
nt|r_tibre: looks like will be a 2-session affair|pg||
mb|1D|nt|subhranp:  5d would have been easier to make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pappoo: 6S   6Nt can both make here|pg||
nt|psyck: Thx Arvind|pg||
nt|r_tibre: dsm cud go into 5th w/ a tiny lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|r_tibre: arun and suhas cud create some swings in the coming sets|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mackulky:  so Manyawar still have some space to make up some|pg||
nt|prasun1966: EW can make 4@H  high-card doesnot permit though|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Difficult for N to enter into here in vulnerable position and would be dengerous also |pg||
mb|3D|nt|jain: x by s?not  many's choice for sure|pg||
nt|thak: 6 hands no swing in a row. don't see that every day..|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: after 3 sets, formidables were leading 89-63 |pg||
nt|prasun1966: Great Satya took the right decision|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck: 4 swingly deals follow though|pg||
nt|r_tibre: true alok... not bidding cold games not winning tactics|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: NEXT SET AT 12.15|pg||
mb|4H|nt|subhranp:  that is some aggressive bidding and as the cards are it makes.|pg||
nt|pappoo: will probably go 3NT 4NT and north has to decide whether to go on|pg||
nt|nkgupt: suspect all one way|pg||
nt|psyck: could well be|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  good lead|pg||
nt|jain: trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  what will RV play after winning?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: why not jain? what will u bid ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: pass 1s|pg||
nt|r_tibre: that lead secures 7 tricks.. shd be a fast claim|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mackulky:  the defense started on correct foot and RV needs to comliment it by @H Q or 9 |pg||
nt|nkgupt: 8 they played @s part making only 9|pg||
nt|thak: here comes first of those|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 4@H makes  they r a little bit agressive now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mackulky:  is there any news on the position of the other match ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: NO|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe more dangerous to come in over 2@S or 2@H|pg||
nt|r_tibre: thats what i was expecting from arun and suhas :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mackulky:  well done|pg||
nt|subhranp:  6s is on|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  yes but is anybody going to get there?|pg||
nt|pappoo: this probably shows some interest and a 5 card suit    i am guessing i do not know their methods|pg||
pc|dT|nt|subhranp:  well if anyone wants to recover then can reach there|pg||
nt|pappoo: other room stopped in 3NT so a likey 13 imp pickup for the texans!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|sandipdang:  shd be 12 trks easy|pg||
nt|thak: 7 to DSM for aggressive bidding and good guessing|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mackulky:  nw a duck |pg||
nt|pappoo: shud play back a club|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 55 also can only be a + for dsm|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pappoo: putting the declarer to test|pg||
pc|h4|nt|subhranp: can make 6 here|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mackulky:  all caards favourable for W and shud be duplicated|pg||
nt|prasun1966: wd|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mackulky:  it looks Raju will manage at the most 4 tricks and may be a fifth by some endplay if the defense falters |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|nkgupt: what time next set pramod jee|pg||
nt|prasun1966: stl -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: 12.15 NEXT SET|pg||

nt|kista:  12 imps|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mackulky:  so a minor swing of 3 imps to manyawar|pg||
pc|c4|nt|prasun1966: 2@H was only there  if N could have played the 2nd @C|pg||
nt|r_tibre: will be up to sumit and laltu again|pg||

nt|kista:  If NS pick upa penalty here instead of bidding the game|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 42 brds to go a lead of 17 odd still anyones match|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: ok they found it.)|pg||
nt|mackulky:  I think it all hinges what quality of 3 level openings pasrtnershuops agree to at Vul first seat|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Sumit thinking will this be a push?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  partnerships|pg||
nt|mackulky:  first oor second seat|pg||

nt|r_tibre: 5m goes for only 500... 4@S not cold of course|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Yes Rajesh me too  but anything can happen on bridge table|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mackulky:  formidables sorry mistype|pg||
nt|mackulky:  well done |pg||
nt|alok_daga: so the lead is 18 unless someone gets tempted on brd no 42|pg||

nt|arunbapat: so match will be tied 125/125|pg||
nt|prasun1966: A 'push' board hopefully|pg||
nt|pappoo: possible 2 imps to railways here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|psyck: yes play could go similar to other room with just @h finesse extra to make 4@h here|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|subhranp:  West in the other room prefering to treat the hand as weak 2 hand and stayed a level lower.|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Yes B42 is a very tempting hand  :)  somedays 7 can be bidded|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 4@S makes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|prasun1966: In the other Semi-Final  TexanAces is playing against Indian Railway|pg||
nt|prasun1966: -1 or '='  let us see|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any run from 1ntX as on the other tbl they wud be in 300 zone .....|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mackulky:  he decides to play for the split hon in @H|pg||
nt|subhranp:  not sure who is at fault but they got to go back and discuss this|pg||
nt|subhranp:  railways have gained 6imps on B24 to take the lead as the DSM pair in the other room played in 2H and went down|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|mackulky:  well this shud be a huge swing as i am told in the other table Texans are in 6@D |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: for the trump lead North shd have long @Hs .. so cross ruff must be safe|pg||
nt|thak: given that sumit and bhabesh are partners majority of the time, and all 4 part of same regular team. It is not surprising that auction was identical|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sandipdang:  yes - this one is all abt partnership understanding|pg||
nt|subhranp:  has to guess which way to play diamonds if a club shift comes now|pg||
nt|psyck: basically set up @d's & take trump fin, cannot lose control with the black suits under control|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Now it may make|pg||
nt|prasun1966: N is blocked|pg||
nt|r_tibre: sure it does... but not cold|pg||
pc|c7|nt|prasun1966: lost 2 imps here|pg||
nt|subhranp:  in the meantime railways pickup 6imps on B52 where the railways pair in the other room played in 1nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kista:  Texans had lots of missed oppurtunities here to recover thefull deficit|pg||
nt|r_tibre: on others even 12th trick may not come by :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|prasun1966: But 12 tricks is in hand|pg||
