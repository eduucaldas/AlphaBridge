nt|tez: önce yan rengi saðlamak gerekiyor|pg||
nt|sastro: no - 2 NT was just a forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2: club lead in the OR|pg||
nt|psyck: Sementa lead @c other room|pg||
nt|star6ija: but I really hope that the match is exciting for the neutral spectators|pg||
nt|star6ija: as well as for the fans of both teams|pg||
nt|monde9: NS played 3NX -2 when W played here 1 @H =|pg||
nt|geot: or take advantage of the heart lead, cash all the heart winners and the spade king. then clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: see if N/s can bid this slam|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly unlucky, that - did well to reach the only game with a chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: the english e/w are in 6nt on bd5|pg||
nt|murat e: board 7|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie Cezary gra precyzyjnie jesli as trefl jest z 4 tym waletem pi...|pg||
nt|riccho:  a small @s would have saved one down by E W could win the@sA and switch to @d|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ken__: Kratos|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=F1, (good 12/13)14+ HCP, 5+@D 4@D441    [F1 = forcing 1 round]|pg||
nt|blum1956: E and W hands are beautiful if considered separately|pg||
nt|tomi2: now the @D can be discarded on clubs|pg||
nt|osvaill83: hard to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: 4|pg||
nt|ken__: final ne zaman olacak|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: ilk 4 takým nakavt yapacak|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: taþýma yok|pg||
nt|lechcold: tê drug¹ lewê wpadkow¹ to RGR zafundowa³ sobie sam|pg||
nt|pauleger: even 6@c can be made here double dummy|pg||
nt|nilsland:   7 will be good for Sweden, Madala playing 4@HX|pg||
nt|star6ija: who is supporter of weak 2 openning with N hand|pg||
nt|geot: 420 is a good result here by the Bulgarian N/S pair|pg||
nt|baardolav: Ok 3@s... one defence trick and QJT9xx|pg||
nt|monde9: this board as a trap : 3 NT can be played for 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|oleberg:  They strugled to 3NT, whereafter west wisely doubled to call for a heart-lead|pg||
nt|barnets: some would preempt with north hand|pg||
nt|chick: wow, they had a chance for a good pickup when NS didn't sacrifice|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  correct|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzeq: maçlar haftada 1 gün oluyor biraz uzun zaman sonra  |pg||

nt|psyck: they will just get to some game :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|blum1956: while much less beautiful together |pg||
nt|tez: 2 sanzatu zon kesin demekti|pg||
nt|tez: onlarýn sistemi öyle..kendi baþýnýza denemeyiniz lütfen|pg||
nt|geot: I guess it is a style question, 2 or 3 in these vuls|pg||
nt|gulyas: so chalk up another win for muilderberg (5-5 2 openings)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1nt? I thought EW play natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is feisty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not a good move|pg||
mb|3C|nt|james_h: Cheeky overcall vul|pg||
nt|james_h: I presume 1@h shows 4+@h|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|geot: 1@D|pg||
nt|geot: = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|james_h: sry ...|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@d = 4+@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am still trying to figure out how our table made 4|pg||
nt|nilsland:  both pairs use a weak opening with both majors, EW 2@H NS 2@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C = beide OF oder starker SA ab 24 oder GF in einer Farbe|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: ok ok....but never do it again:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: might sit for this|pg||
nt|nilsland:  meanwhile we have an easy 4@H here|pg||
nt|tez: 13/15 dengeli ..4lü majör yok|pg||
nt|star6ija: the auction in the OR is Multi 2@d openning|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3@s shows good hand with Major still not clear|pg||
nt|mcphee: this might land them in 3N|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@h right operator?|pg||
nt|baldjean: 5@c appears logical for me now|pg||
nt|lesniak: bardzo dobre 3 ba  i gorsze choc idace 4 kier|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzeq: 3@dmax dengeli el alert edildi|pg||
nt|baardolav: club lead is good|pg||
nt|fluffy: at te other table a transfer secuence made south declarer and a club lead gave away the contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: think he will have the nerve to try 3N Mats?:)|pg||
nt|geot: if north play low on the heart lead,win the 9, A of hearts, spade to the king and the hearts, then clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: and opened 3@D in open|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: but Smirnov seems to have made only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C did not promise any suit|pg||
nt|begse: diger masada 3 pik kaldý|pg||
nt|nilsland:  No!|pg||
nt|mcphee: no fair:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 13+17=......|pg||
nt|barnets: playing multi 2@D would prevent weak 2@D opened|pg||
nt|osvaill83: now they will |pg||
nt|murat e: on that hand originally 4 spades can be beaten but needs some very good defence|pg||
mb|5C|nt|james_h: East expected a little more also|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||
nt|james_h: Hi Karel|pg||
nt|mcphee: redble not what Karpov wanted to see|pg||
nt|blum1956: sure|pg||
nt|mcphee: so he might also sit:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: NV I would sit hoping for -200|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@s here is natural, but 2@c could potentially have shown a stronger 2@s - though he had passed, of course|pg||
nt|riccho:  well... :)|pg||
nt|murat e: after dia lead declarer has to play a heart south wins and returns a trump down it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: Half time just called by TD... we may see them step on the accelerator now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: arggh|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what does this all mean|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north probably showed her exact shape with 3nt|pg||
nt|blum1956: But he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|mcphee: he may well make this|pg||
nt|psyck: yes did not play 2nd @c before trumps...|pg||
nt|james_h: 10 in I expect dispite 5@c going -1|pg||
nt|james_h: 9 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure if 2@c is GF, but if not 2NT sure is|pg||
nt|osvaill83: bit lucky slam with spades 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|chick: this will take some really good defense to beat|pg||
nt|lesniak: naukowa , precyzyjna licytacja Burasa z Narkiewiczem w rozdaniu 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|ken__: tref pasý yaparsa 4@s olur|pg||
nt|tez: yan rengimi saðlamaya çalýþýrken 1000 oyuna batmýþýmdýr heralde|pg||
nt|james_h: This this table has only 2 speeds, slow and very slow|pg||
nt|james_h: It was lonely working here|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, EW plays precision|pg||
nt|james_h: reduced to 7 now :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 1nt shows both minors or both majors?|pg||
nt|geot: win the 8 I mean. Anyway, difficult hand, very difficult|pg||
nt|geot: old fashioned limit raise, 1@S-3@S. Not many play that anymore.|pg||
nt|roswolf: arent 10 tricks cold?|pg||
nt|chick: the @H10 sets up as a stopper and then hearts are blocked with no entry in S hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW got chance to recover - if they manage to bid game |pg||
mb|p|nt|ken__: þimdi kozu buldurdu|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is not making, hands do not fit well|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a Francuzi odbieraj¹ Rosjanom to, co oni nam zacharapczyli|pg||
nt|blum1956: it is close|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C lead is wonderful when he sees the 10 on the dummy|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2-1|pg||
nt|fluffy: its a great hand if 4@c shows short in clubs|pg||
nt|osvaill83: 2-1 sorry , thx Boa|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  unrealistic, of course :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: ama yan rengi saðladýðým için yaptýðým el sayýsý milyondur|pg||
nt|james_h: :)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: so 2 swing boards so far bd 5 looked lively 5@Dxx-1 ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@H is natural and invitational|pg||
nt|tez: bizim kýzlar da 26/0 önde|pg||
nt|MolvaM: açýk seri skorlar http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=914&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably, maybe a major and a minor? there are several schools for overcalling against precision in Hungary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: S may feel he has a bit to spare and go on - perhaps with 4NT - no, he has passed|pg||
nt|chick: once W gets in, she has 5 clubs, 3 diamonds (although she doesn't know it yet), and the heart.  |pg||
nt|murat e: north had to lead a small heart to beat this|pg||
pc|sK|nt|clinch: This won't go too well, but 1NT looks as though it makes 7 tricks|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=914&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu da kadýnlar serisi skorlarý|pg||
nt|MolvaM: multi konvansiyonu konusunda deðerli yorumcularýmýzýn görüþleri?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes as you said but had to cash @DAK before getting off dummy|pg||
nt|riccho:  these sort of mistakes should be avoided in a EC and especially vs italy. They tend to use it against you very severely|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ken__: tref pasýna gerek kalmadan da yapacak|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4h+2 is one more than seems possible|pg||
nt|mcphee: so now we have a game on the line|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3 diamonds, 1 club and 1 major card away|pg||
nt|monde9: on 8 4 @H -1 when N lead the singl @D |pg||
nt|monde9: in TOR|pg||
nt|monde9: Denmark coming in match with the board 8|pg||
nt|oleberg:  8 sure tricks, but really nowhere to go for the ninth|pg||
nt|monde9: if little @H from the dummy now :)|pg||
nt|barnets: thats why south neede hold only 2 |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fluffy: but with north as declarer this is probably going down|pg||
nt|star6ija: now second relay 3@d and the major is revealed reversed way @ss shows @hs, @hs shows @ss...this method is created to allow strong hand to be declarer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I reckon even I could make this (on a good day)|pg||
nt|barnets: when east gets in can play @SJ|pg||
nt|geot: wd|pg||
nt|fluffy: opposite a limited hand you can use 3NT as no short slam try, since 3@s is limited you don't need serious or non serious for anything|pg||
nt|barnets: many play 3N asks for sing here over 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: and bids at 4 level show sings|pg||
nt|grebrof: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzet: hi all|pg||
nt|grebrof: Im in the wrong room|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzet: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: good luck to Dimitar at North|pg||
pc|d2|nt|james_h: now, where to?|pg||
nt|gulyas: note that the lead did not give much away - defenders could not play @Ss effectively anyway, and 2@Ss can be discarded on the @Ds anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can make this improbable contract now|pg||
nt|gulyas: how?|pg||
nt|barnets: this will eventually pick 4 spade tricks for def|pg||
nt|dburn: Versace giving Lauria quite a lot of rope as usual - but this time he missed a game|pg||
nt|chick: now N can cash @SA and the @HK and she's done|pg||
pc|d7|nt|geot: This will be a pick up for Norway, a nice pick up actually|pg||
nt|james_h: I expect so|pg||
nt|psyck: yes 3@h probably just showed @h|pg||
nt|clinch: Just to be clear, I wasn't criticising any bid, just noting E's aggressive style|pg||
nt|geot: Actually I dont think Madala and Bocchi play weak 2@S in these vuls|pg||
nt|jbennet: funny hand excatly thisd hadn more or less came up 2-3 matches ago. bidding went the same|pg||
pc|dA|nt|riccho:  7 tricks |pg||
nt|barnets: for specs asking @HA fin 9 @H @H @SK @C and dec hs only black winners in hand|pg||
nt|jbennet: north then had 2173 and bid 4 sp over 4 hearts (which of course was a phantom save for -300. (4h was -2).|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: can get three club pitches on diamonds|pg||
nt|james_h: I have to go I'm afraid ... real life stuff is such a pain!|pg||
nt|barnets: just as north had|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C forciert zur PArtie, 3@S 55 und minimum|pg||
nt|sastro: er hat keine andere Wahl als @h Dame zu ziehen und dann @s zu lösen|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sprawdzanie zatrzymañ karowych ustawi³o "troche gorszy" kontrakt = Balu powinien kara zrzuciæ na dubla|pg||

pc|d9|nt|james_h: Thanks again Daniel, enjoy the rest of the match Kibs!|pg||

nt|Walddk3: How many tricks did declarer take on board 7?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tez: hadi abartmayalým.999 999|pg||
nt|james_h: can N/S unravel?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond not an attractive shift unless a singleton, willard should work this out|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 10?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yararlý konvansiyon mudur? biz de oynayalým mý yarýn sabah ilk iþ?|pg||
nt|monde9: -2 now|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Mandatory to take one heart, depriving declarer of an exit-card|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie wyczu³ blusa|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lechcold: do rundy fina³owej|pg||
nt|blum1956: in fact the fate of the contract did not depend on the lead thanks to 2 aces in dummy|pg||
nt|baardolav: Here is the links for all the running scores http://eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|geot: System card says 4-11 6 card, but GF in green ag red. Unusual|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The continuation is not so obvious|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|gulyas: too bad the 3rd is not high|pg||
nt|clinch: NS have a bid to show a hand with longer minor than major, but this hand must either be 2@s or pass|pg||
nt|barnets: cash @HQ then play club|pg||
pc|dT|nt|monde9: if little @H from the dummy on the first trick 3 NT had a little chance|pg||
nt|mcphee: his weak bid both majors really put the boots to them|pg||
nt|chick: W has little choice but to attempt the @D finesse, and will be delighted to claim 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lesniak: to jeszcze nie koniec tutaj|pg||

nt|baardolav: Both 4@s and 4@h makes... +1 I believe |pg||
nt|geot: Game can be played in either major, np. |pg||
nt|oleberg:  3NT = Preempt in a major|pg||
nt|monde9: when N playing 1 NT made 3 on king of @H lead|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Cannot remember the diference betweem this and a direct 4@H|pg||
nt|oleberg:  West tempted to pass? :)|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea thinking or BBO is slow ? :)|pg||
nt|monde9: They can read "The Dubliners" during that :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Hagen thinking. I enter the bidding two at a time so players on other side of screen dont know who is taking their time to bid..|pg||
nt|monde9: ok Ty :)|pg||
nt|barnets: and no good fit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: well it does work if not covered|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: This is a great result for Ireland|pg||
nt|geot: may be copied? If North bids 4@Cleaping Michaels|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@C only down 1, but 5@H is close to making, too|pg||

nt|geot: 4@S is a super contract|pg||
nt|geot: and here we go|pg||
nt|james_h: snap|pg||
nt|geot: 4C! is showing a big hand with 5@C+5@S|pg||
nt|james_h: I doubt that will be the case come board 20|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT N/S on a possible @D lead may make.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even making four required major help from defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin deems his hand not worth a constructive direct raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@S can make from south hand, with some luck and a spade guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: briçte senyör = 60+ yaþ demektir|pg||
nt|star6ija: sacrifice is good here|pg||
nt|geot: Great fit both directions|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: face psiakrew na le¿¹xo licho siê pisze:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and Netherland is already 1VP ahead of Italy (beating Ireland 19:11)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|star6ija: but Madala gave up|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Looks like 2@D vulnerable it a week two|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like def slipped up also on last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=F1, (good 12/13)14+ HCP, 5+@D 4@D441   this is first time i've seen  the good 12 apply|pg||
nt|blum1956: the vulnerability may prevent EW from the 5th level save|pg||
nt|geot: Looks like declarer must have taken the double finesse in hearts at the other table|pg||
nt|geot: for running scores all series: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tomi2: NS in 5@Cx on 9, the double will make it easier to win (make overtrick)|pg||
nt|monde9: now that's the time for Konow to hesitate ? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: they can tell by the mouse clicks. This is standard procedure for vu graph operators. |pg||
nt|gulyas: EW has 3@Cs making, maybe even 4|pg||
nt|gulyas: so NS stealing the contract in both rooms|pg||
nt|baldjean: no dilly-dallying here; I would directl< go for 3nt if I were N. why give opponents information?|pg||
nt|geot: I guess the pair holding the spades will "win" the bidding, but how high|pg||
mb|p|nt|ken__: ama bu kadar önde olduklarýný tahmin etmiyorlardýr bence|pg||
nt|geot: If declarer does nothing funny there will be 2 spade losers and a diamond loser|pg||
nt|blum1956: Do Bakshi-Townsend have an agreement against the popular "redouble=bid your auit" convention?|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçmesinin sebebi..2@d kontrlu oynamak istemesindendi assaelin|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sorulara cevap vereyim|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: line up yazýlýrken  tahmin etmeleri lkazým:)|pg||
nt|geot: He will probably cross to hand with the @HA and take a spade finesse followed by the ace, then play on clubs for +620|pg||
nt|clinch: Pass looks normal here|pg||
nt|clinch: Yep|pg||
nt|baardolav: Aronov will earn one imp on this hand... if NS play diamond and diamond all the time|pg||
nt|baardolav: you need the double finesse for the entry|pg||
nt|geot: not really|pg||
nt|star6ija: the coach Vladislav Ispoeski helped me with explanation of the openning: 54+ in majors (NonVul maybe 4441), VUL usually 55+ 6-10|pg||
nt|oleberg:  5@H is even wrongsided|pg||
nt|solex333: lead directing bid ?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW did not came close to 6@D/@H but suits does not break|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: will they investigate @D slam?|pg||
nt|blum1956: "your suit"|pg||
nt|blum1956: Karpov is accurate|pg||
nt|clinch: Cards don't lie that well even for declarer to make 3|pg||
nt|clinch: Seemed to my (lesser than these guys) eyes to be between a 2 and 3 @h rebid|pg||
nt|monde9: same story as in Open|pg||
nt|oleberg:  In West it takes the lead of a diamond-singleton to defeat|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Virtually impossible to find :)|pg||
nt|monde9: 4 @D was alerted :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: both majors are makable, lets see how 2@S fares here|pg||
nt|baldjean: since this contract will not make it does not matter much|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, not certain about NS system - not sure whether 2@c is GF or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if 4NT is quantitative|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: on hand 8 down three is that ok we just waiting for the |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry priv|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tez: 2@d ya pas geçeyim..ortak kontr der belki..ben de pas geçerim..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bir oyuncu 60+ yaþýnda ise hem senyör hem açýk takýma katýlma hakkýna sahiptir|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Probably a re-transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whatever it is, it's taken up quite a lot of room|pg||
nt|murat e: hands fitting well despite zero trump fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: but other lines will work as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what inferences are available from Fantoni's sequence  [2@H then 3N  vs  immediate 3N ...]|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably the agreement is that 4th hand passes first with good hand|pg||
nt|chick: well, they did well to avoid the heart game, since ruffs are possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziurawa ta rêka S ale partner ma wszystko co trzeba|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ters taraftan oynuyorlar ama @c atak edilmez heralde|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise Townsend's first pass looks strange|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no doubt 2@C was some form of gazilli|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  1@h by E was transfer to @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and actually, in 1NT, defenders may collect 4 tricks in the suit bid by E :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@H needs 3 rnds of @Ds to beat it|pg||
nt|kamyk: uparty ten W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess -- Fantoni was showing hand that hoped for reopening DBL|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lead so long as they collect the 2@c b4 S gets rid of one|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N only chance of making game|pg||
nt|fluffy: lower that I though at first, @sQ doesn't look very offensive, but 7@h is 7@h|pg||
pc|d6|nt|blum1956: His hand deserves a 3@h bid if it is nonforcing. Still it could force according to their agreement|pg||
nt|geot: some problems here...when trying to ruff clubs West can ruff over|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ken__: 2tur boþlayacak körü|pg||
nt|lechcold: E te¿:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: Smirnov's actions in this match are not very successfull|pg||
nt|clinch: @s suit won't fetch, @c finesse wrog, but may have to be taken for -2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani Açýk takýmlarda yaþ ve cinsiyet sýnýrlamasý yok|pg||
nt|baldjean: at the other table N directlly bid 3nt|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|james_h: Wrang was not born yesterday|pg||
nt|star6ija: Isporski *|pg||
nt|barnets: so 4@H down in other room with 4 inescapable losers|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ken__: karo atmasý lazýmdý yerden|pg||
nt|ken__: 1@d 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzeq: evet |pg||
nt|clinch: May have to be attempted, in order to make contract|pg||
nt|geot: Italy went down in 4@H where Helness played 5@D +1|pg||
nt|geot: 2 down, so 13 IMPs to Monaco|pg||
nt|geot: Not easy this contract. May lose a heart, a club and two overruffs if he goes for the club ruffs|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe best line is one trump, then two round of diamonds?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|geot: 3NT will most likely go down as well|pg||
nt|geot: 4@H was an ok contract?  3-3 hearts or club finesse|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: szybki claim|pg||
pc|s3|nt|james_h: He use to play in the High/medium skates rubber bridge game in TGR in London for many years|pg||
nt|fluffy: you cn affrord to leave north with one trump|pg||
nt|riccho:  obv you managed to feed computer with results|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: got there in the end|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|geot: oops|pg||
nt|geot: if he runs this one it might be some trouble here|pg||
nt|geot: or...then he will go down to put it another way|pg||
nt|james_h: he will play the Q|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|geot: that is why the first suggested line is better, I think|pg||
nt|geot: just to cross to the heart ace and finesse spades|pg||
nt|james_h: lol|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If S played a spade back at trick 2 its much harder to find the @D switch by west.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: He's keeping the trick up... giving this plenty thought|pg||
nt|baldjean: it may even be down 2|pg||
nt|baldjean: if W continues @h now E gets a ruff|pg||
nt|sastro: alles was man machen muss ist die @h-Dame zu finden - ich persönlich hasse das, wenn das so ist|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|kamyk: straszny pesymista - 5@H móg³ chyba wyksztusiæ - okazja dla naszej pary w otwartym |pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h kontruna doðu eliyle 3@c denebilirdi|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, going down for sure now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcphee: if the redble is a the 10 mark his simple raise seems to get across what he holds|pg||
nt|baardolav: You need will make the double finesse now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will be a bit worried about that result.|pg||

nt|geot: don't think so|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: açýlmaz diyenler parmak kaldýrsýn|pg||

nt|tez: büyük abi 5@c olur diyor|pg||
nt|geot: the defence must be careful now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: not sure about 3@H, presumably it showed his junk, not standard gazilli but everyone seems to have their own version|pg||
nt|begse: 2@d 6 tane körle pas dermi salvo sadece pik þikanla neg free bid oynamadýklarý için tercihini pastan yana kullandý|pg||
nt|barnets: south plays @D7 s he does not want one back|pg||
nt|barnets: @DQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow a rare misguess|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fluffy: actually duck directly a trick without finese|pg||

nt|gulyas: nice play, now a @D ruff coming as well|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, which makes it down 2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ken__: aynýyere geldi|pg||
nt|clinch: So I prediict -2, though none of us would finesse the @c of course|pg||
nt|geot: Spade A and another seems to be the best now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcphee: so he will grab his 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: no time to mess around|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Double dummy you may make 6@H but...|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|blum1956: Thanks to the spectator I realised that Karpov is PH. Then I suppose 3@h was most correct|pg||

nt|riccho:  game needs @d 2-2 and @s finesse working, so nothing to wriote home about|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tez: benden size tavsiye hiçbirþey için hiç bir zaman demeyin:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: think it's either weak or GF|pg||
nt|clinch: I think 4@s will make in practice|pg||
nt|gulyas: this will be down around 2|pg||
nt|riccho:  3@d is more aggressive in convincing Partner to bid 3nt with a @d stop|pg||
nt|riccho:  but 4@c is more difficult than 3@c|pg||
nt|geot: wd Drijver. He new the hand in a way now, but still a good defence. Also the switch to the 7 of @D was important (not a low) |pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl a 1 suited|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  4@H is a good sacrifice against 3N|pg||
nt|fluffy: opposite 15-17 north's hand is a game drive for me, but opposite 14-16 I don't know|pg||
nt|baldjean: though we have of course seen matches where the trailing team still won|pg||
nt|gulyas: so maybe a swing for Hungary, as EW can make game (4@H or even 3nt probably)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3 down is also possible if they play a trump in time|pg||
nt|riccho:  the strngth of 3@c depends on the strength of intervention bids. |pg||
nt|roswolf: now might get feisty|pg||
nt|chick: the @Hs come down with no losers, @SA is onside, and the @D honors split|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nilsland:  NS make 5C but not 5D!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: put the jack on this trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gayet atak bir deklare|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@c presumably shows diamonds with at least invitational values|pg||
nt|riccho:  S is happy that he mustnot bid now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: john asked 3d ? shrug of the shoulders |pg||
nt|barnets: scotland bid it|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@h shades the diamonds, this is normal with this shape unless your diamonds are strong, or you have extra strenght (and thus bid 3@h over partner's rebid)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Helness pondering whether he can make 4@S on previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 3 nt oynanacak|pg||
nt|tez: burada da|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 2 imps to Ireland db 9 2@h-1 vs 3@d+1|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, or 12+|pg||
nt|clinch: With trumps breaking|pg||
mb|p|nt|ken__: 2@c attýðý için o opsiyon kalmadý tabi:)|pg||
nt|tez: ben beni gördüm çok: açarken:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Only lead to give cause for concern is @h K|pg||
nt|clinch: Although this is awkward in a way|pg||
nt|clinch: Will be saved by @d A position|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kör atak edildiðinde hemen olacak|pg||
nt|geot: hard to avoid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@h short suit try|pg||
nt|psyck: when N rejects try, S settles for game|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now we can relax - 9 easy tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: no, forget that, its 5@D5M, limit or better|pg||
nt|fabsayc: close to making, in fact i think it makes|pg||
nt|reisig: Might make this|pg||
nt|gulyas: I can understand that double:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Madala has called TD|pg||
nt|james_h: I expected McGann-Hanlon to compete on that board|pg||
nt|tez: kontr @s ataðý istiyor..rakibin canýný alma amaçlý deðil|pg||
nt|baardolav: no game make ns... |pg||
nt|fluffy: and now bocchi suspects no stopper avaible|pg||
nt|monde9: ???|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm sudden end was rather unexpected|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tez: hiç kimse bilemedi 4@c oynanacaðýný|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2c not alerted at the time but later explained as Gazilli|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, this late to decide to bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s needs a correct club guess after the heart lead, being laydown after the diamond one|pg||
nt|monde9: ah ok :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Greece - Turkey 25-5 at the moment|pg||
pc|c6|nt|baardolav: 2 imps for italy|pg||
nt|riccho:  and here is the downside of the shaky 1@d-opener. Partner is willing to get to the 4-level|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=918&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|geot: Difficult to chose a lead from East's hand here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ken__: ve demiþler gerçekten|pg||
nt|ken__: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C = South African Texas     standard Texas transfers with 4@D/@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is right of course, but unusual|pg||
nt|geot: If Shouth held diamond ace instead of the spade K this bid would have been fine|pg||
nt|roswolf: cant see where 10 tricks come from|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looked like 9 ok in @H ew|pg||
nt|roswolf: but may/should be a fair result for the english cause|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: why?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: not sure. play continues, but he has left the table. may only be looking for some1 to turn the cards|pg||
nt|blum1956: If the declarer uses the diamond suit correctly he will sooner or later win|pg||
nt|blum1956: But he does not know the advere distribution. The only thing he may be sure after the lead - 3rs spade trick|pg||
nt|tez: @h as @h as diye tezahurat yapmayýn..@s atak edecek|pg||
nt|baldjean: probably down 2, siknce Q@d won't be guessed|pg||
nt|baldjean: since*|pg||
nt|roswolf: quick play|pg||
pc|s3|nt|monde9: South is playing in Open it was N|pg||
nt|geot: hard declarer problem again. Maybe he must finesse the club then to win|pg||
nt|fluffy: how to play this?, maybe try to stablish some hearts before club entry is gone, or perhaps draw trumps and play your best in clubs (low to 10)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sastro: ich sag besser nix zu dem Ausspiel- kann man denn nicht einmal neutral @h ausspielen >?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 3s is beatable|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice def|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some players have a rule to always bid game after 1M-3M if they have a singleton or void|pg||
nt|fluffy: we can see that drawing trumps works, because he cannot be tap with diamonds|pg||
nt|geot: if he don't finesse the ten he is in danger of losing three clubs and a spade|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzgn: he is back now explaining his absence - but in italian!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart ace and ruff and second ruff when in with spade ace|pg||
nt|james_h: The difference on board 9 was Fitzgibbon deciding to upgrade his 13 count to a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 7 tricks on top.  Possible overtrick in H, or long spade - but i doubt declarer will risk anything|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kötü deðil aslýnda. kör ruanýn uçmasýna baðlý |pg||
nt|gulyas: did not notice the trump spots, it could be down 4 now|pg||
nt|barnets: the scottish west made a try with 2N and when east bid 3@C bid game|pg||
pc|d3|nt|geot: nice|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tez: 4lü @s im varken 2@h açmýþsam..@s imi @d larýn arasýna koymuþum pardon ortak diyorum|pg||
nt|tez: fena bi zon deðil..@h rua uçsa olurdu|pg||
nt|barnets: game is quite decent|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: now will simply play clubs|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: also diamond|pg||
nt|gulyas: OR made 3@S, so this is an important hand|pg||
nt|psyck: Running Scores: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|begse: 3@h e 3nt bence çok agresif  ortak karo vadetmediki|pg||
nt|MolvaM: genel yaklaþým olarak takým maçýnda yaklaþýk %35 yapma þansý olan zonlarý oynamak uzun vadede karlý oluyor|pg||
pc|c4|nt|clinch: This works well|pg||
nt|barnets: can pressure be put on north who isholding the pointed suits ?|pg||
nt|geot: establish heart was an option, but he don't even know the club king is an entry|pg||
nt|barnets: cards lay well for dec|pg||
nt|geot: Nothing can hurt him now, can it?|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think no, he is in control, what about 3NT? lack of comunication can make it hard to make, but defence really only has 1 trick in each suit|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to beat also|pg||
nt|geot: I think finessing clubs was by far the best line|pg||
nt|geot: going for the hearts needs a guess there, and later guess in clubs to get an entry etc etc|pg||
nt|fluffy: I think you are right Geo, but when I see all cards I never trust my judgement to be precise :)|pg||
nt|murat e: club finesse not working:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|remo: puoi fare come Lucy :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C = transfer to @H   4@D would be transfer to @S|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't always work, of course|pg||
pc|h4|nt|blum1956: good start, now he will succeed |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Khokhlov still thinking|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably  the best for Khokhlov is to discard a club and then try to create a loosing option for the declarer by leading a small heart (when in the lead)|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, looks like 4 down indeed|pg||
nt|gulyas: ouch, Hungary down in 5@H in the OR|pg||
nt|barnets: the nice play was to finesse clubs bfoe playing trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: before trumps|pg||
nt|fluffy: he can't fail now, but he can foresee a problem|pg||
nt|fluffy: if someone has @sK10xx he won't be able to enjoy 5th club unless clubs are 3-3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|riccho:  but 4@d is 10tricks now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tez: doðal forsing bu|pg||
nt|geot: another push, declarer can't get rid of more than one club, so +140|pg||
nt|blum1956: now this option is over|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Now Bakhshi,s turn to think|pg||
nt|mcphee: so just makes|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Heavily odds-on with an opening in North|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psyck: you can click on the table number to see that match details & then on deal number to see how it was played across matches|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer is definitely afraid of @d ruff, but it costed him a pair of imps|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tez: pas olmamalý her sistemde|pg||
nt|clinch: This has worked fairly well; quite a complicated hand, but Forrester diagnosed the @c break early and now just the 3 losers|pg||
nt|barnets: I think to have had any chance in this hand dec had to duck a heart early|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kdr_fm: play the heart up now incase N started with AKQ8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fluffy: but in that case he would rely on @h finese I guess|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Right Henri - I said 9 :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so a small gain turned into another small loss|pg||

nt|ahollan1: west hand automatic opener for most big clubbers -- not sure if deWijs will open 1N [good 12-15]|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@d is 4+ diamonds unbalanced|pg||
nt|begse: tek karo|pg||
nt|monde9: a lightner here for -1 X in N in TOR|pg||
nt|gulyas: -6 instead of +6|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@S  seems too high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzet: there was some misunderstanding between Ivanov - Kapitanski while bidding|pg||
mb|1S|nt|clinch: X=majors|pg||
nt|riccho:  good slam bid here by EW. Just the @d position kills 6@h |pg||
mb|2D|nt|gulyas: it was the lucky 1nt opening - if it went 1@C-1@H overcall, they would never have gotten to this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Fantoni's DBL = same HCP as opener|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a fairly routine 3NT E/W ..|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2@d 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score on board 7 is still wrong|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4@H is down on a diamond lead - as 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make double dummy perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: low club towards the jack|pg||
nt|nilsland:  South would like to X here - but it may show a hand with 4+@S|pg||
nt|monde9: 6 @S is the normal & good contract|pg||
nt|monde9: for N-S|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not really, when 3@H is a winner|pg||

nt|nilsland:  and welcome!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: but Muller treating the DBL as artificial rather than Penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs Strong NT   NS DBL = 4@H/@S and 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe always that shape, but vs weak NT  also shows HCP|pg||
nt|blum1956: The Rudakov-Khokhlov CC does not contain the meaning of the 2@h  bid|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess it guarantees at least 3-card support, thus Rudakov is able to splinter|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel putting a storming performance so far ... I'm looking forward to reviewing their results|pg||
nt|oleberg:  This might end with 6@S in south|pg||
nt|ritong: if you did so, id a free shot for me:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS will end up in 3nt, and will get a @C lead|pg||
nt|barnets: Madala bid 2@S over 1n|pg||
nt|geot: Turkey is leading Monaco by 6 IMPs after 12 boards|pg||
nt|geot: South has a good hand|pg||
nt|barnets: i meant to actually make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exctly, only @d 5-0 is slam killer |pg||

nt|ritong: really saying " you won t toy with me lorenzo"|pg||

nt|clinch: 3@s probably preemptive, as X mainly disruptive|pg||
nt|baardolav: here... coffee I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as experinced kib pointed out, 6@d is cold|pg||

nt|nilsland:  surprisingly - but RD showed a good hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And Lauria is hoping for a club lead|pg||
nt|monde9: :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Where an underlead of clubs is needed|pg||
nt|baldjean: Hungary now need 6 IMPs per board to still win this|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w may not get in bidding now|pg||
nt|geot: but it depends on methods|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s I meant|pg||
nt|barnets: with 5 losers but the scottish west bid 4@S over 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeq: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he expects the contract to be cold|pg||
nt|clinch: Well it's obviously preemptive... I mean by agreement|pg||
nt|monde9: same 200 but different contracts :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi hi|pg||
nt|riccho:  a 3-0 @h position is far more likely than a 5-0 @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the formula is 3sn+1|pg||
nt|ritong: 2sn+1*|pg||
nt|ritong: ty ty|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemos double is a little aggressive but makes life easy|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C invitational stayman|pg||
nt|gulyas: or just showing 4@H now with a minimum GF|pg||
nt|geot: this looks strange|pg||
nt|barnets: par looks like 5@SX down 1|pg||
nt|barnets: which again seems a lot|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, but look at the deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: These lads don't make it easy for me :) All conversation at this table is in Russian, including explanations and claims|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is not obvious to double a partscore knowing that you have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|ritong: south visibly having the rest of the high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the @d five bagger is a bad surprise|pg||
nt|nilsland:  BjÃ¶rn knows that Lauria is prepared for a club lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so he will not lead a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so sure he wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In this situation Fredin could not pass over the RD because that would probably show values - so 3@C is not a free bid|pg||
nt|ritong: also, who understands redouble?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would translate " my @hs are fine"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble=max hand probably|pg||
nt|ritong: has he?|pg||
nt|geot: this will not be any swing, standard 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible to go down|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody|pg||
nt|riccho:  hi!|pg||
nt|barnets: he has come to bid this set it appears|pg||
nt|geot: Need to guess the diamonds to win this 3NT|pg||

nt|clinch: Might have been clobbered if N only had 4 @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer just needs to guess the @SJ to make, which should be a normal play to finesse|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean, normal to play it to W after E shows up with the long @Cs|pg||
nt|baldjean: N/S can develop a @H trick here for 9 tricks, but it needs careful play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good 2NT rebid - 2NT usually stronger in a balanced hand, but here W has a good source of tricks in diamonds  |pg||
nt|barnets: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|barnets: for running scores|pg||
nt|osvaill83: 5@H|pg||

pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: interesting use of 4C as a kind of leaping michaels, kibitzers will no doubt say standard in France but new to me|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 1S shows @D i assume - 2@s anyone know what that means ?|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@d pretty comfortable losing 3 red tricks in all likelihood|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: bardzo miêko zalicytowali tu NS|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i blame it on the defenseless 3@S bid :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: when did that bid promise any defenses?:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: I first played against Tiit Laanemae in... probably 1979. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs a spade switch sharpish-like|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not obvious for either North or South, that this is a cashout-situation|pg||
nt|riccho:  and to defeat 6@h N has to lead a @d (which might happen after a lightner doubl)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: defenseless bids cause opponents to overbid|pg||
nt|gulyas: well bid, this may make|pg||
nt|geot: Some will maybe consider 3NT as South. Bad contract, but would make |pg||
nt|monde9: Rotaru X the 6 @S for @D leading in TOR|pg||
nt|geot: South did not bid at the 2 level, but 3@S. He knows that North has got a singleton heart because of the fact that East superaccepted the transfer|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|sastro: merkwürdig- denke mal, dass 2 D als Transfer gedacht war|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzeq: akþam pardon|pg||
nt|gulyas: that would not work with E having 2 aces|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after an A/K lead vs NT, the defenders carding is usually either count/attitude, not suit pref - so if N finds a spade switch we can be seriously impressed |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w have only 1 obvious loser|pg||
nt|barnets: in hearts|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: no bonus points for being in 5|pg||

nt|gulyas: N needs to cash his @HQ to beat it|pg||

nt|gulyas: its true that his black suit holdings are not very promising|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: after 2@h 3@H by w|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: if pd has a @C honor, and only one @H honor, @HQ could be fatal|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: i speak about led|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: he has closed the screen and asked if 3@c was forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: now sketching sample hands and asking Hegedus how he would have bid them|pg||
nt|nevaio   _: if 3 @c is forcing Bocchi probably plays @hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: I cannot tell exactly what the @D8 is, but says on the card, that hi-x is even, low-x is odd|pg||
nt|gulyas: but its attitude as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: so he cannot have Axxx|pg||

nt|baardolav: and here same number of tricks all over|pg||
nt|oleberg:  6@D is an ok spot|pg||
nt|ritong: he has the entries for the standard trump handling|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helness looks like a man that makes it|pg||
nt|barnets: if 4@D was a natural bid why did East not go to 5 level ?|pg||
nt|riccho:  sementa seems to be quite good in leading ... :) |pg||
pc|c2|nt|james_h: well denies a major anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D explained as 18-19 bal - hard to overhear, but I think 2@s was explained as denying major|pg||
nt|tez: güney dengeli 16 puanla 1 saniye düþünmedi pas geçmek için|pg||
nt|geot: E/W has 5-4 hearts, so the 3@S bid may not be so strange as it looks|pg||

nt|nilsland:  never in much danger however|pg||

nt|riccho:  bidding in bd 12 was not very convincing|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Helgemo is hoping for much more bidding|pg||

nt|mcphee: and now the 3N|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hear NS is in 3@D on bd12, so this a 10 imp pickup for Hungary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very quiet set so far - biggest swing 8 imps|pg||
nt|riccho:  in mypersonal opinion: you sould not open 1@h in a astrong club system with a hand with game-forcing values|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@s is a take out double I think double would show 4+@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes england bid the vul game - allez les blancs|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H can be set on @D lead with ruff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d 9 for the start and so on|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: good judgement on the 3@h by NS in the open room|pg||

nt|mcphee: helgemo, no fear pard we have em now|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t think daddy bessis loves it|pg||

nt|barnets: 6@H makes |pg||
pc|c5|nt|geot: Tough 3@S bid from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at other table nystrom doubled 2@H, a move i think should show a better overall hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was time we started the comeback :)|pg||
nt|april7: its a nice pass by S, but a game try was appropriate imo|pg||
nt|barnets: 6N appears a trick short|pg||
nt|barnets: unless lead @CA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|geot: and North bids 3NT on the stiff king over his partner's t/o double|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that versace does not wander in doubling 2@h|pg||
nt|monde9: better lead : @H |pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We go for crossruff|pg||
nt|mcphee: this isn't over yet:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: we are not sure which side will go for the cross ruff yet|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Geir know that Tor will lead a trump if he has one.|pg||
nt|geot: so a Michaels Cuebid here, and a tough 4@C bid by Duboin|pg||
pc|cT|nt|geot: All fine about the spades, but 3NT does not work very well anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C artificial game force, not sure about the rest|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No slam possible here.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and whats the TD verdict pls operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: still no ruling on board 3|pg||
nt|monde9: like that S can take the hand on the Jack of @C to give the ruff in @H|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|james_h: it maybe helped by the EW action|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: declarer will want to draw trumps may just cash the K+A and then play on D which works on all 3/2 splits.  If the trumps 4/1 though ...|pg||
nt|ritong: ouah|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now he worries about the long pause|pg||
nt|gulyas: with everything friendly, 5 or even 6@C is a decent contract|pg||
nt|fluffy: now with @hQJx and @cA Versace doesn;t want to har 6@c|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gulyas: no lebensohl? strange|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 5@c? co to mia³o byæ?|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Were he thinking about 5@D??|pg||
nt|mcphee: hehehe|pg||
nt|april7: but successfulaccording to the layout|pg||
nt|barnets: unlucky trump break for n/s|pg||
nt|tomi2: hier haben die Russen offenbar ein Misverständnis, 2SA war mit Sicherheit nicht als natürlich gemeint|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nevaio   _: maybe inverted on @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, they play inverted lebensohl style|pg||

nt|fabsayc: yes, must be around 25% or 100% on actual layout|pg||
nt|ritong: confirmed, operator?|pg||
nt|sastro: da ist auch was schief gelaufen- |pg||
nt|murat e: Netherlands may get the lead if 2 sp down other table which is likely|pg||
pc|d2|nt|riccho:  yes. looks a bit overpessimistic to pass 2@h (NS playing 1NT 15-17)|pg||
nt|barnets: while this is a qualifying for the Brmuda Bowl the European Championships themselves  is one of the toughest tournaments to win and very prestiguous|pg||
nt|fluffy: that was quick|pg||
nt|geot: Italy won 7 imps on board 10, the 4@S that went down here as Fantunes played in 5@Hx minus 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: fast claim from helgemo without playing any more tricks|pg||
nt|geot: I am not saying declarer played wrong here, but think he could have won it if he went for the clubs ruffs....even though West will ruff over|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but helness having a break...back soon no doubt |pg||
nt|geot: bd 10 that is....one club gets over ruffed, then East will later be squeezed in the minors. Double dummy though|pg||
nt|fluffy: the action is now on board  11 at the other table, what is the contract?|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@h|pg||
nt|barnets: Monaco s gain came when Bocchi misguessed the play in 4@H|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@h requires a non trump lead or switch to make due to lucky @dK third and no promotion|pg||
nt|barnets: losing to the @DK singlton|pg||
nt|barnets: when other lines would hav made the contract|pg||
nt|murat e: previous board|pg||

nt|tomi2: dann könnte Joerg ein weiteres Coeur spielen|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcphee: down 3 2 hands in a row not encouraging|pg||
nt|riccho:  germany and poland are in comfortable leading position now and are heavy favourites for 5th and 6th place |pg||
mb|d|nt|geot: I guess 2@D shows a major, possibly weak?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 6NT on with the fortunate @C position|pg||
nt|baardolav: 30 HP ns... no 8card fits... 4nt |pg||
nt|baardolav: make an undo... operator|pg||
nt|geot: Operator?|pg||
nt|baardolav: North is opening|pg||
nt|monde9: except major accident, 4 @H is so easy to bid & make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite handy here to have double available as the weakest bid, and for pass to show a few bits and pieces|pg||
nt|geot: 9 tricks in 9 seconds:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: dann muss west eine schwarze Karte abwerfen und hat keinen Übergang mehr zu Partners Karostich|pg||
nt|famus: that kills the NT goose|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|james_h: I'd make the cheapest action, 3@s too rich for me|pg||
nt|geot: North did not bother to listen to this, and the standard 3NT was reached|pg||
nt|mcphee: that is a heavy 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: Netherlands defeated Italy in the semi fina of the last World Championships before ging on to win it|pg||
nt|pelu:  only N know the 1@h bid by East|pg||
nt|fluffy: if double was just take out I think Helgemo would bid 3@c, but on the modern style that shows hearts his hand is not worth it|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: WJ gór¹|pg||
nt|lesniak: szkoda ze Adam nie wyszed³ D trefl:(|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeszcze Cezary mo¿e zagraæ asa i male|pg||
nt|lesniak: tak|pg||
nt|riccho:  difficult hand for N; doesnt look good to pass or dbl or bidding 2@h. X looks like the least of evils|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: I kinda like 3S in these vuls, although it is for younger people than me, really......|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Yes this did happen...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Rudakov thought a long time before passing|pg||
nt|clinch: Hasn't been a set full of swings, but tricky to navigate through these|pg||
nt|geot: South is checking for five card hearts|pg||

mb|2D|nt|lechcold: jak tu zaj¹æ NT od tego waleta karowego?|pg||

nt|blum1956: I hope this is again an operator slip|pg||
nt|blum1956: No!|pg||
nt|blum1956: He did in fact pass |pg||
nt|mcphee: 9 winners|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: TD calls half time... these boys play fast!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This typ of preempts will only lead to 3N|pg||
nt|baldjean: 6nt fine here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Scotland doing well in the Seniors aye|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|baldjean: but will probably not be reached with an ace missing|pg||
nt|tomi2: und Joerg könnte sich den Pik entwickeln oder vier Treffstiche machen, je nach dem, was abgeworfen ist|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is unfortunate|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Sometemes contracts like this one come home but not today|pg||
nt|blum1956: *sometimes|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 32 pts - may well be bid - lets hope they dont try the 4/3 spade fit which on another day may be the winning action|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry for sudden outage but luckily no play lost|pg||
nt|murat e: EW can make game here guessing in heart suit correctly|pg||
nt|famus: @sk is going to be a regretable lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gulyas: 3@H is 300, so its not a bad contract|pg||

nt|MolvaM: thanks martin|pg||
nt|tez: @H E @C KAÇACAK..sonrada @d rua ve @s ruayý uçuracak|pg||
nt|april7: must be something wrong, 2 @C shouldn't be passable|pg||
nt|barnets: funny I have some specs who prefer seniors and others the open|pg||
nt|tomi2: sicher ein glücklicher Kontrakt, aber Joefri darf sich freuen, wenn er sein Bild übermorgen im Builetin findet :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: but they find the good 3nt|pg||
nt|ritong: which they would have bid left to themselves|pg||
nt|nilsland:  When you preempt you should want opp's to bid rahter then the opposite|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks like 11 tricks in @hs here|pg||
nt|baardolav: Stefanov fiind the best lead|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Both pairs "Missed" 6@S here|pg||
nt|mcphee: not far from 6@S here, but good they avoided that|pg||
nt|barnets: two ofthe seniors are ex partners of mine |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or fortunate from Italy's point of view|pg||
nt|riccho:  another push here to be expected|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but good try both tables|pg||

nt|baldfriede: a kibitz kindly gave it to me|pg||
nt|clinch: Only danger is that EW overstretch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how many aces do you want me to have, thinks South|pg||
nt|barnets: Coyle and Silverstone|pg||
nt|pelu:  some af the seniors play very well - but Open is still stronger - but seniors play simple system og kibs like to understand the bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: who have played for Scotland since I was in short trousers|pg||
nt|paulg:  You had to move to Florida to get away from them, Barnet?|pg||
nt|barnets: not florida shorts either|pg||
nt|sastro: schon richtig- aber zu dem Quest kam es leider nicht|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's pity - finding EW with @h AK for no value|pg||
nt|riccho:  and even now @sA might have been in s hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as the only hope, indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sastro: neuner -Ausspiele sind heute nicht die beste Wahl|pg||
nt|psyck: lead helps a bit|pg||
nt|psyck: still lot of work to find 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: S may very well lay down the @sA early|pg||
mb|4H|nt|james_h: they are in 6n already at the other table|pg||
nt|ritong: here, 4@s can be profitable when east has 6+|pg||

nt|lesniak: kocowka w piki na we z reki E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: a to jest decydujaca sprawa|pg||

nt|clinch: Interesting double|pg||
nt|clinch: No idea what it means|pg||
mb|5D|nt|monde9: all the ways go in Rome|pg||
nt|solex333: denmark : not very successful in open series . but leading by far the senior series |pg||
nt|solex333: 60-20 imp vs. turkey|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: w 13 nieoczekiwany zysk 3 imp bêdzie|pg||
nt|pauleger: N should not switch to the @h9, when he is in with @d, |pg||
nt|gulyas: this may score an overtrick now|pg||
nt|geot: cute contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: declarer may have to endplay South to make, after forcing a @h pitch by S on 4th @s|pg||
nt|sastro: to duck an honneur bets the kontrakt|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Lauria consulting the Germans convention card and asking about lead..|pg||
nt|lesniak: przykra wpustka|pg||
nt|famus: they are now going down in a 5 level contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: will play a @s toward the KJ, may cash the @CA see if he can get honest count|pg||
nt|clinch: How easy will it be for E to persude W that he has 4 card @h support?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm maybe the luck will go england's way on sunday!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcphee: might be a bit concerned here as 3N seems to have some play|pg||
nt|barnets: top 6 teams Q for BB|pg||
nt|barnets: the diamond suit is a nice source of tri|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D suit is a nice source of tricks|pg||
nt|famus: cud well have bid 4@cs as a kibtz pointed out|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sastro: small back|pg||
nt|fluffy: fall of @d10 makes it easy even if aronov ducks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pauleger: low @h now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  But who am I to teach the italians how to bid :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: if aronov ducks I believe Bocchi play club for the ten|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no i trzeba da¿ lewkê |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|clinch: Guess that was known then|pg||
nt|pelu:  and @s10 in trick 1 was a mistake by E|pg||
nt|lesniak: niepotrzebna 9 ka pik na wiscie|pg||
nt|famus: but all 5 minor gets beaten with trump promo|pg||
pc|s4|nt|blum1956: 1@c could be everything, still 3@s is a  dangerous bid (@s xx and @h Kx with South is enough for the game)|pg||
nt|geot: He might do that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: note low from worthless doubleton    in Slawinski   low from even without honor  or  odd with honor|pg||
nt|pauleger: endplay squeeze coming up|pg||
nt|psyck: @c fin 4@s's, @c endplay seems to work now|pg||
nt|sastro: but S will be squeezed on 4 rounds of @s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, we are all saying the same thing :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: @C8 of Fritsche seemed a bit odd|pg||
nt|sastro: but missing the communication for the squeeze   |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Lauria thinking...|pg||
nt|psyck: One would bet on him figuring it out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's more like it :)|pg||
nt|barnets: Bocchi guessed 3N|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kdr_fm: has on real option now but the @C finesse, when E will show out in @s|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: could play east for @HQxx precisely but I dont think thats as good odds as the @C position|pg||
nt|fluffy: going to cross ruff as much as they let him|pg||
nt|barnets: where Helness did not|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ano|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|clinch: So, looking at convention card it seems that double may just have meant "don't lead a @d"|pg||
nt|monde9: Yes they are leading confortably on seniors ! :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|nt|famus: might have a new leader|pg||
pc|d9|nt|star6ija: 12 tricks possible now|pg||
nt|geot: I am sorry guys, gtg (falling asleep to be honest, it is 2.30 in the night where I am). See you later.|pg||
nt|barnets: that was 12 imps to Italy|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: claims on cross ruff|pg||

nt|barnets: running scores|pg||
pc|h4|nt|geot: bye|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would go for the @s later and first finesse in @d, since al suits covered twice|pg||
nt|baldjean: all*|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: We have seen a match so far, with not too much action, really. Norway went down in a game they could have won, and Ireland bid a very tough but good game they won. That is about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for NS  that works up through 9x|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: at this moment due to vacant spaces 6@D with E and 1 with west.  West is likely to hold any card declarer wants by the odds of 12-7 fairly significant|pg||
nt|MolvaM: defans trefl çakasýný alamazsa yapacak|pg||
nt|tez: @c gelse @s oynasa|pg||

pc|h7|nt|kdr_fm: west is actually getting squeezed out of @C's here - must guard the !majors|pg||
nt|april7: very nice declarer play|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: druga wpustka|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|baardolav: he will not be able to make 12 now... |pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||

nt|lechcold: równy podzia³ pików oznacza, ¿e na WE wychodzi zarówno 4@S, jak i 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 12-14   could include any 5422 except @H & @S  [so 5-card major is common]|pg||
nt|mcphee: so the bar is open?|pg||
nt|gulyas: luckily, this is not a knock out match|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  I am not sure they can bid either :P|pg||
nt|ritong: making friends is your strong points, true?|pg||
nt|ritong: -s|pg||
nt|clinch: Taking vulnerability into account|pg||
nt|baardolav: A new 4nt from OR|pg||
nt|baardolav: where 6@s can be made...|pg||
nt|barnets: a club lead defeats an e/w slam|pg||
nt|riccho:  :) |pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = TRF, not necessarily @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: possible 6|pg||
nt|gulyas: gain half of it back, and I would be happy:)|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3@c looks like a Bergen raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 10 the english taught the italians a shap lesson in 2@hx -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: in his room south did not overcall since he bid 1@H himself, so he does not know the @H layout|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not really hehe|pg||
nt|baardolav: both black small slams and 6nt is makeable|pg||
nt|geot: Friendly clubs makes both 6@S and 6NT makeable. Have to solve the spades though|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6 @s needs very unusual treatment of trumps|pg||
nt|geot: You have to bring in the spades in NT as well|pg||
nt|monde9: the finesse in @H was protecting the @C in the same time|pg||
nt|tisserand: good bid 4nt|pg||
nt|barnets: at present Monaco 21 a head of england in 2nd and 32 head of Italy|pg||
nt|roswolf: sharp|pg||
mb|4H|nt|geot: They are good players, but I do not expect them to win this time. They are young, very good, but ......maybe in a few years|pg||
nt|james_h: Fitzgibbon is not lacking courage|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@s not easy to reach|pg||
nt|james_h: 3@h is a balanced slam try (I think)|pg||
nt|ritong: oohh|pg||
nt|baardolav: it is no help making the @c tricks in 6nt... before you play spade|pg||
nt|april7: nothing special here, easy 4@H, but a 3@C opener might have made NS task more difficult|pg||
nt|barnets: in diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: can they get to hearts ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  13 tricks for NS without @h lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: now looks like on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Forrester must know that Gold is weak, and one assumes that must mean he has 5 @d at least. I'm just guessing this, but it's logical to me|pg||
nt|tez: 5@d @h ataðýndan sonra batýyor(muþ)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1SA zeigt 4+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: double club have single spade...|pg||
nt|mcphee: make a lot of @S here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  That why they are playing so quick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 9 imps to France on board 11 - 4@sx= next door |pg||
nt|mdgraham: N has an awkward hand-type|pg||
nt|april7: the vulnerability held W back from opening 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu:  in OR East bid 3@D and now S sh know that he has to protect his @d-trivk by leading @S in trick 1 or trick 2|pg||
nt|barnets: in third|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes another 7 imps|pg||
nt|murat e: these 10 hcp hands are always problem west did well not to invite this time|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 6@c is cold, indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@C game force, 3@C relay, not sure about 3@D|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah apparently 1@d showed 5@d; thanks|pg||
nt|gulyas: S reopening yet again, N is happy to pass that|pg||
nt|gulyas: but it needed some @S plays to beat this 2 tricks I think|pg||
nt|fluffy: Monaco is going very well, but I wonder if they can keep this pace, at some point they will either be more tired than others, or make Pierre Zimmerman play a  bit more|pg||
nt|fluffy: maybe for this 2 pairs getting tired doesn't even enter their vocabulary :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|james_h: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: dont know if it will make any difference tho|pg||
nt|geot: Unusual to let E/W play 3@C I think|pg||
nt|james_h: Israel are a tough outfit, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Monitor gone, Muller thinking again! Players joking about the situation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 4@c perhaps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: Not enough from Karpov's point of view, needs some extra values (few)|pg||

nt|barnets: we |pg||
nt|barnets: yes even trump switch is too late now|pg||
nt|barnets: dec can duck a diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: ruff a diamond |pg||
nt|barnets: and lose a heart to north|pg||
nt|barnets: who has no more diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: he can then pitch his diamond loser on long heart|pg||
nt|pelu:  can he make on @S in trick 1?|pg||
nt|barnets: i am not sure he can make it on a trump lead no|pg||
nt|pelu:  u are the expert Barnet :)|pg||
nt|barnets: as south can get in with a club to cash the long diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: perforce @S @D @S @DA @D ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: now cant duck heart to north|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: actually only 1 board behind other room|pg||
nt|baldfriede: S was afraid of @h, it appears|pg||
nt|gulyas: the defense has to be careful not to try any trump promotion|pg||
nt|baldjean: still ok with @H switch, I think|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see diamonds are well placed|pg||
nt|barnets: but it would be a poor slam|pg||
nt|jbennet: a winning view taken by west wd. Not clearcut.|pg||
nt|barnets: going down |pg||
nt|barnets: when diamonds bad|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and as a lot of kibs pointed out - 6@d and 6@s, too :) |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|geot: In my opinion I think South should bid 3@S. I know I am seeing all the hands, but.....|pg||
nt|baardolav: true|pg||
nt|baardolav: sorry private|pg||
nt|monde9: it was not a big risk of ruff in @S with the lead of @D|pg||
nt|barnets: Wests 4N showed two places to play|pg||
nt|barnets: who can put south in with @CA|pg||
nt|roswolf: a controlled auc5tion here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even this modest contract will bring 10 imps to Italy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|baldfriede: so no 3nt|pg||
nt|baardolav: Even if you miss the spade play in 4@s here... I think Bulgaria make +1 imp|pg||
nt|fluffy: this lead ensures the 2 spade tricks fron south :)|pg||
nt|geot: At this moment Israel leads the group. But it is 237 237 236 236|pg||
nt|nilsland:  1NT would have been better this time|pg||
nt|mcphee: difficult to pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe some S hands will act over 1N|pg||
nt|mcphee: no fun defending NT with S hand|pg||
nt|barnets: thats what I see anyway for what its worth|pg||
nt|geot: Nice lead:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: these two are excellent in the part scores usually|pg||
nt|roswolf: tricky lead may have to finesse to make the contract - tough|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|blum1956: As everyone may see, in the OR Khiouppenen doubled 1NT, then Forrester (East) bid 2@d (which probably was "diamonds or majors"?) and was buried there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now cue bids (this partnership's favorite action)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  In many systems East will be able to show short diamonds which would cool off West|pg||
nt|ritong: @s lead looks very possible after this auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so they better stop lower than 6|pg||
nt|tez: þu direktör onlarýn aleyhine olcaksa.kararý bildirseydi..iyi olacaktý|pg||
nt|gulyas: ouch|pg||
nt|pelu:  tx :)|pg||
nt|barnets: for setting trick|pg||
nt|pelu:  ok 1 out of 3 - try a @s now|pg||
nt|barnets: needs tump lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nilsland:  At the other table it started 1N-3@D showing 4441 with a singleton minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that a whole lot better|pg||
nt|clinch: This looks to be on the @h guess; won't be much of a guess after Forrester turns up with AQ of trumps and a @d honour|pg||
nt|murat e: may pairs play nt 14-16 for that reason|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|james_h: 3s initially, makes life easy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Yes - west will ask for which minor and then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@d might be turbo-ish|pg||
nt|ritong: showing odd number of keys and something interesting in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: a priori interesting, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT would show even number of keys|pg||
nt|nilsland:  at least we know that they probably know what they are doing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think they play turbo on this auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: now down 1 only|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: good lead by south|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  12 that way|pg||
pc|h6|nt|geot: South showed a good raise of spades with 2@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|barnets: anyway making now for sure so|pg||
nt|lesniak: szlemik wyraznie poni¿ej 50%|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kdr_fm: if east had the @HT - 6@S could make - as it is the @HT with west will beat it.|pg||
nt|april7: 2imps to Ireland|pg||
nt|barnets: good match|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps E was a bit conservative|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or not|pg||
nt|ritong: i t would match  now, i m told they do play turbo, but restricted to minor fits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a straightforward hand to play - may try a cross-ruff|pg||
nt|jbennet: many X instead; for 300 ; now they get 680 instead. (4NT was of course primarily 2 places to play. |pg||
nt|geot: should have been a stiff Q somewhere|pg||
nt|barnets: north may have problem on run of diamonds|pg||
nt|geot: Helness will come under pressure here|pg||
nt|fluffy: but versace would have to reject @c finese to run diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: he has to throw his hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: as expected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  easy lead from the sequence :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|clinch: Will have to play a @h early now|pg||
nt|baldjean: still a little swing for Hungary, since it was not doubled at the other table. but not enough|pg||
nt|barnets: both teams still in contention|pg||
nt|pelu:  difficult for S not to play @C A - but in OR where East maded at trial-bid in 3@D u could find the @s-lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|geot: Italy, Bulgaria and Turkey|pg||
nt|barnets: so all specs should be happy|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|geot: Myself I do not like 3@S the first time unless it is agreed to show some cards|pg||
nt|geot: I think it is too strong for 3@S initially|pg||
nt|geot: he must keep two spades two clubs and onlyone heart to set it|pg||
nt|fluffy: as long as helness keeps a low spade I think he is safe|pg||
nt|barnets: the south can win @SK and lead a club|pg||
nt|geot: so he can let Helgemo in to shoot a club through|pg||
nt|geot: oops Stereo, Barnet|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: he has to keep 2 spades|pg||
nt|fluffy: club finese risjs going down a lot|pg||
nt|barnets: @SA and another|pg||
nt|fluffy: board  13 big swing for Italy when the hearts were doubled too sonn|pg||
nt|barnets: I think west almost knows the layout of the hand|pg||
nt|geot: But Versace will probably take the club finesse? Isn't that by far the best chance anyway?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: very nice play from Fantoni|pg||
nt|psyck: Sementa will return @h after winning @d, maybe Piekarek will have an idea then|pg||
nt|april7: 8 of @D to makje sure:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: accurate defence|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: i was busy thinking maybe deWijs does better to play @DJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe it will be too late then, he is still thinking how to play the @D|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, too difficult a hand, even when looking at all cards :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yapmak içen @cQ yerini bilmesi gerekiyordu|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama daha ilk turdan empas atmasý için bir sebep yoktu. normal oyun|pg||
nt|barnets: still a swing to Italy|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes, best chance, but risks -400|pg||
nt|barnets: if north had @SAK he may have led 1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ferlema: http://csbnews.org/my-way-iv-by-norberto-bocchi/?lang=en|pg||
nt|lesniak: niemniej rozdanie zdradliwe, moze gdyby Cezary nie dal kontry...|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|james_h: I have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|clinch: As otherwise Forrester will get a @c ruff|pg||
nt|monde9: -1|pg||
nt|monde9: for 6 IMP's|pg||
nt|solex333: ok if k of h offside, a of @c onside and spades 4-1 or spades to dummy return spade and east ruff with 2 @s. but|pg||
pc|cK|nt|geot: but I dont think it can be right to let opps play 3@C on Souths hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: they move to the next board I guess|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Muller will think again -- but it is too late|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Nunes as dummy takes out a magazine to read|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Italy, Monaco or Ireland??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Sry, lost play|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running score linkleri þu adreste|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I do not say that 1N is always making - but passing may still be good in the long run|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: no worries Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Magazine was Italian!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: lose a @D ruff one - if @c's 3/3 or JT drop it makes or if one defender has to guard hearts and clubs - so odds wise maybe low 40's slam - which is poor|pg||
nt|eyamut: battý|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: that was  said, lemme see....21 lines ago|pg||
nt|ritong: but great minds drink alike:)|pg||
nt|clinch: Good defence, and would have been supernatural to find the counter-play|pg||
nt|clinch: Before knowing the @s position|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|lesniak: w rozdaniu gdzie Fisher otworzyl 3 pik , K. Buras niestety otworzyl 2 karo i we doszli do 3ba:(|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mcphee: it sure can|pg||
pc|s5|nt|clinch: Nothing about the bidding suggests Gold has such a weak hand|pg||
nt|barnets: tx to Tos oour operator and Peter and all specs bye to all and regards to scottidsh friends|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|famus: a nondescript @h wud've been the best lead here i guess|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|james_h: My bridge suffers from real life and vice versa|pg||
nt|gulyas: no, its a push|pg||
pc|hK|nt|blum1956: Certainly he could try some 5th level invitation (the 5@d cue probably being the best) but the 5th level was not safe from Maxim Karpov's point of view|pg||
pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: açýk takýmýmýz A grubunda|pg||
nt|tez: koz gelirse|pg||
nt|tez: batacak|pg||
nt|tez: yapmaz hata sanýrým..kolay|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sizi totemciler sizi|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tez: kozu alamýyor þimdi de|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually east denied a spade control and west bid slam reluctantly so any lead but a spade would mean fredin was not listening|pg||
nt|geot: he will get one more trick|pg||
mc|11|nt|geot: 400|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 more England Gold & Forrester having a great set|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs to discard here|pg||
pg||
