nt|barnets: Hi all|pg||
nt|baldjean: hello all|pg||
nt|baldjean: we start with a nice @c slam for N/S|pg||
nt|baldjean: the question is: will the slam be found?|pg||

nt|barnets: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|barnets: here are the standings|pg||
nt|barnets: poland 9 behind germany and 10 behind israel|pg||

nt|barnets: only 6 Q for BB|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|psyck: ok we are back with the correct boards|pg||
nt|pauleger: that looks right|pg||
mb|d|nt|james_h: Welcome All|pg||
nt|mcphee: decent slam on the way|pg||
nt|clinch: Looking at this board, NS will probably bid to 3NT, but the duplication in spades will make that an uphill struggle.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi - looks like a quiet 450/420 for the start|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, top9 teams advance to the second RR, and these teams are currently 7th and 8th, so a big loss may cause either to drop out|pg||
nt|barnets: hi all|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: NS in 3@Cx in the OR|pg||
nt|solex333: prob one of the most successful pairs in dk and ro for the moment|pg||
nt|barnets: so Norway beat Monaco with 1 norwegain pair playing for Monaco|pg||
mb|2H|nt|james_h: e/w play a strong club|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: A short delay here - apparently we started too soon!|pg||

nt|james_h: they wont hear you from there Geo :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect lots of alerts this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C [and all 1-suit openings] = forcing  |pg||
nt|gulyas: so we expect a friendly match here:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS play 12-14NT|pg||

mb|4H|nt|james_h: N/S play transfers over str @C or Canape?|pg||

nt|hawe45:  I have seen players open the South-hand with 1 @D|pg||
nt|gulyas: of course, some 11s are allowed:)|pg||
nt|james_h: Ireland play Italy next, so its going to tough going|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H is to play, which E has a perfect reopen for|pg||
nt|gulyas: not that W is happy, with 4333, and his 4 card suit is @Hs|pg||
nt|james_h: I hope to be ring side for Ireland next match ... poking Bocchi etc so that he loses concentration etc|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice try:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary somewhat easier opponent last round, Portugal|pg||

nt|gulyas: 2@H is probably down, but its close|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@s seems to be the likely contract|pg||
nt|barnets: Turkey 3rd|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: e/w used raptor|pg||
nt|tisserand: good morning|pg||
nt|gulyas: obviously it was not S thinking, but W|pg||
nt|james_h: @h lead|pg||
nt|barnets: norths jump to put pressure on e/w|pg||
nt|barnets: how will Italy do with 1 Italian pair playing for them?|pg||
nt|geot: yes:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|james_h: 1@h shows @h and a longer suit|pg||
nt|geot: 3NT seems like a natural spot|pg||
nt|james_h: when 5332, you have to bid a 3 card|pg||
nt|james_h: e/w ignoring and bidding natural|pg||
nt|james_h: .... maybe :)|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@d is 2+, 3@d still shows the Majora for E/W|pg||
nt|james_h: Majors|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the screen, bids are entered by the operator after both on one side have bid|pg||
nt|james_h: might make|pg||
nt|gulyas: S and W are on the same side|pg||
nt|gulyas: this lead certainly helps|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he lets it run|pg||
nt|james_h: East unlikely to have 5 @s|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@c is obviously forcing|pg||
nt|baldjean: S is probably pondering whether to bid 4@h or 4@s. I would choose 4@h|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and Russia, not without chance for 6th place, but rather (more realistic) - stuggling for stay in top-10|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|baardolav: good morning all|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North's 4@D usually implies some sort of spade fit|pg||
nt|barnets: and the defense are helpless|pg||
nt|geot: This is very open, a fantastic match I think. Fantastic players anyway:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nilsland:  1@C is natural or bal 11-13/17-19 and 1@D transfer|pg||
nt|solex333: hi ole|pg||
nt|solex333: 1 down with careful play|pg||
nt|barnets: this is down 2|pg||

nt|barnets: yes best def @H and heart|pg||
nt|barnets: dec ruffs and pays !A  and club|pg||
nt|barnets: @CA and club|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a clash that will go a long way to decide the silver/bronze medals|pg||
nt|chick: Already a bid that I dislike ... unless EW are playing canape, I think you should open your longest suit in any 6-5 hand .... it's strong enough to reverse if necessary simply on ...|pg||

nt|geot: to overcall 1@D|pg||
nt|oleberg:  2@H = 8-11, and any 5-3-3-2 or side-suit in hearts|pg||
nt|jbennet: however against spade lead 6 clubs requires either D 3-3 or D 4-2 + 10x in clubs somewhere. |pg||

nt|fabsayc: so in reality madala should have come down to singleton heart keeping extra spade|pg||
nt|barnets: as he became short an entry to south hand|pg||
nt|barnets: not what east wanted to hear|pg||
nt|geot: H/H playing strong NT also in balancing position|pg||
nt|fluffy: some players would bid with Lauria's cards I think, I think I wouldn't|pg||
nt|dburn: or a fit-showing effort, but if that is so 3NT is not easy to understand - though Versace may be hoping for @cAK with East and 4-4 hearts|pg||

nt|baldjean: as I said; youj have to uess it|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, everything suddenly went quiet and North got to play his game|pg||

nt|gulyas: S showed his @Ds, and N decided 3nt will be just fine|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S wanted to find out abt @Hs, he could have started with 2nt, so no need to bid 3@H now|pg||

nt|vugraphzeq: oo pasa   dikkat etmemiþim:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he did, declarer can win the @H and put him in with @Ss - its a matter of figuring out the distributions really|pg||
nt|geot: Better trump suit in 4@S, but maybe not an easier contract?|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks easier now|pg||
nt|geot: should win it even though trumps are 4-1 and the diamond Q can not be cashed|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, bd3, 3@S ended up down 4 in the OR, 10imps to IRL, leading by 13|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice lead|pg||
nt|james_h: pop the ace and play @d|pg||
nt|gulyas: this may beat the contract, unless EW block the @C suit|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, but still, 2@Cs and 2@Hs to give, and a @D|pg||
nt|james_h: then EW know the @s Q is an entry and def is easy|pg||
nt|james_h: so declarer must be more cunning|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you play a low @D, they may not know|pg||
nt|james_h: looking at the N/S hands its still a good games ...|pg||
nt|james_h: if the @d 3-2 and the Q with East|pg||
nt|james_h: or if the @h ace with West|pg||

nt|geot: to be fair, West had nice distribution but nothing more really|pg||
nt|geot: for a t/o double. So I would say pass was normal|pg||

nt|geot: Super start of this match for Italy!|pg||
nt|barnets: yes  and N/S here know it|pg||

nt|star6ija: leading from some of his long suits East will be immediately thrown in with @d Jack...now he has to find @s switch|pg||

nt|star6ija: yes...and if declarer plays Jack and @d to 9...East must be as fast as a shark switching in @s|pg||
nt|riccho:  advantage is that you have the possibility to bid with the weak AND the strong hands at the same time. |pg||
nt|barnets: a low diamond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: will give dec a 9th trick in nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I came to the auction late because of technical problems. likely missed the alert|pg||

nt|gulyas: on very little values|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I like that meaning of the 2@s bid|pg||

nt|mdgraham: spade lead to the ace and a spade back - hard to play the K. Doesn't matter here, though, with clubs 4-1|pg||
nt|geot: I agree. But I would imagine Duboin also knows what he is doing. He has proved so over the years:)|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is very lucky|pg||

nt|barnets: both 4@S and 5@C would make but @D is down|pg||
nt|geot: note that 5@D will go down|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D|pg||

nt|nilsland:  EW makes 4 @H but would East have bid again over 2@H??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with no competition east's 3@D would be forcing, here the alert was probably that bid is not forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on last board west in open room doubled 2@C and then rebid 2nt only|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe 2NT was for minors even?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this hand in open room north passed and ew are playing 2@H|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@c may have been artificial (it usually is these days), though seems not alerted|pg||
nt|clinch: 3@c then being invitational|pg||
nt|mdgraham: time to look at opps CC - what do they lead with Hxx/xxx in partner's suit.....|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|barnets: only a low @D lead gives contract|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Well, it "just" requires the lead of a small diamond|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Fredin made a balancing bid in advance - which was wrong this time|pg||
nt|baldjean: well, N should know about @c switch now|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|james_h: When U have the machinery, U got to let the neighbours see it |pg||

nt|clinch: This won't be difficult to make|pg||
nt|baardolav: for spade |pg||
nt|barnets: and who can really blame south ?|pg||

nt|geot: practicing the system :)|pg||
nt|james_h: :)|pg||
nt|geot: I am sure Mc Gann does, I am suprised Berg does not|pg||
nt|james_h: East must have seen West lead directing Dbls on previous oceasions|pg||
nt|geot: What I think is that South was aiming for a 5-4 fit in spades, or else 3NT, but then the double of 3@C came|pg||
nt|geot: and he changed his mind and tried for a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if they find the lead to beat it (as they should, pd must have short @Ds for running)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think much of a stretch to double here|pg||
nt|dburn: well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as they do so often|pg||

nt|lechcold: ja tam widzê po:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  the russian are playing 15-17 NT and 2@d opening = 18-19 bal. So 2NT is a free bid, which is mostly used then as a BWDH (Bridge Wolrd Death Hand)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: this will just make i suppose, a reverse finesse fetches o/t|pg||
nt|barnets: yes knowing North as I do he might well blame him|pg||

nt|barnets: 3 rounds of hearts beats 5@C|pg||

nt|mdgraham: will be hard to stop out of game here  |pg||
nt|barnets: for the interested specs rest of the team were Haase , Cuthbertson and the late  Victor goldberg one of scotlands most succ players|pg||
nt|barnets: ever|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Probably West thinking|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @h lead would make declarer's life harder|pg||
pc|s8|nt|geot: As the lay-out is N/S can not hurt declarer much in the spade suit|pg||
nt|baardolav: true... and the natural heart lead, give declarer an easy way for 9 tricks|pg||

nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|baldjean: N may be disappointed, but not for long|pg||
nt|dburn: likely cause is simply that the wrong bridgemates have been put on the tables|pg||

nt|oleberg:  West will feel a little endplayed, when in with the @SA|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Double-dummy this can make, by playing two rounds of clubs, and then a spade to the ace|pg||
nt|geot: GF sequence|pg||
nt|geot: by West, and an ok final contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: a bit tricky on spade lead. |pg||
nt|barnets: this contract is fine|pg||
nt|geot: right opponent has the diamond ace, the one with three hearts|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S verspricht eine unausgeglichene Hand, Nord weiß also von dem Treff Fit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: after the overcall oliveri might have tried 2@S rather than 2NT, assuming that asks for help in spades|pg||
nt|clinch: with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|james_h: agreed|pg||
nt|barnets: not best lead |pg||
nt|geot: the clubs are splitting badly|pg||
nt|barnets: with north ducking 2 hearts|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|james_h: There is a lesson on that last hand for pundits like me ...|pg||
nt|james_h: never count your chickens (or imps) before they hatch|pg||

nt|oleberg:  Allowing for two diamon-discards|pg||
nt|james_h: 9 tricks cold, dare go for 10?|pg||
nt|gulyas: it depends what will happen in this trick:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four top losers, next |pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: drüben spielen die Russen 6@C|pg||
nt|sastro: weiss wirklich nicht wofür man so viel künstliches reizt, wenn man hier nicht in 6 @C kommt|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|geot: I am sure we will see more exciting matches, and to be fair, this match has just started as well:)|pg||
nt|geot: I mean, what can the players do with these boards|pg||
nt|gulyas: N encouraged in @H, so S may continue @Hs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this contract is off the radar |pg||
nt|geot: but the diamond lead was fine for declarer. |pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: @h çaka verecek|pg||
nt|tez: @h oynrsa þimdi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Oliveri may have missed the 1s overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: blame seems to be with golin, whatever 3@D meant it looks wrong|pg||
nt|baardolav: there is no way for Aronov bid 2nt on ten? |pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: then declarer can duck and test the suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bye Bob|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Fantoni thinking this time, not Muller |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: screen down briefly, F asks M a question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe Muller's PASS was a RELAY  but Nunes 3@C ended the artificial bidding|pg||
nt|clinch: Can actually make 6 by ducking a @h to S, but unlikely with the whole @d suit exposed|pg||
nt|baardolav: instead of 2d|pg||
nt|geot: his partner is limited to 15|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes i knoww|pg||
nt|geot: I guess 2NT was an option to try reaching a vul game, but...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Yes, you end up in 2NT on 11+10 hp too|pg||
nt|geot: South did not have a real good lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now E may struggle for overtrick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: 3@h would have shown 4 or 5 @h, 3@s would have shown 5@s, & 3N both majors|pg||

nt|mdgraham: on the last hand - if the defence ducks the first club, it may get tricky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be able to endplay dummy to concede heart tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S much better|pg||
nt|barnets: well a spade would have worked better|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oleberg:  Here West has the safe exit of a club|pg||
nt|tomi2: Joerg hat 8 Punkte in Partners Kürze|pg||

pc|h2|nt|lesniak: ale WE 3 w starszy|pg||

nt|tez: 3@c e 3@d nýn ne olduðu hep tartýþma konusudur|pg||
nt|geot: but from his point of you no lead was attractive|pg||
nt|jbennet: wonder if d lead wil be the long term winner on that one. He knows for sure that east Diamonds holding is strong.|pg||
nt|famus: pretty routine hand|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: seyircilerimiz bu tür teknik ve püf noktasý bilgiler vermenizden memnun oluyorlar teþekkürler|pg||
nt|chick: 3N is the far better contract anyway.  9 tricks on any lead as long as diamonds break no worse than 3-1|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pauleger: should S have taken the 1st @s, to play a @h up and then a @d? propably E will rise thinking S could have stiff @s A?|pg||
nt|geot: Lauria - Versace (in the OR) has not missed much so far in this set, but I think Bulgaria has got a chance on the next board|pg||
nt|baardolav: In 2@d they will end up with minus one now|pg||
nt|baardolav: need to ruff with K|pg||
nt|baardolav: and play trumph|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Perhaps he figured the @H9 showed an odd number|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems to make 11 now|pg||

nt|mathat: 6 @c @d|pg||
nt|geot: Well, this hand was at first scored as 200 in the other room, then changed to 500|pg||
nt|star6ija: about 10-15 years ago, returning from one European Championships, Ivan Nanev, one of the topBulgarian international players shared with me the following|pg||
nt|fluffy: hi all|pg||
nt|star6ija: Italian style is not to play scores with 24-25 points|pg||
nt|star6ija: they never compare +150 with -600 and +480 with -980|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And a club-switch instead ogf the diamond would have tangled declarers communication|pg||
nt|monde9: W helped with the @H second time|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Quite a bad defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 4@s x /1 is correct|pg||
nt|mcphee: might have been better to run more @C there|pg||
nt|gulyas: so back to 9 tricks, playing it safe|pg||
nt|james_h: some cards may be wrong there|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open playing 4 card majors south opened 1@H|pg||

nt|geot: East in OR, Brogeland, went from playing 1@H on board 6 to playing 1@S on this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4441 is systemically opened 1N when 12-14|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea has a good fame as dec in Romania|pg||
nt|monde9: I think the 6th board can bring another points to Romania|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not that he did anything wrong at all, but there was only the straightforward way to play it|pg||
nt|oleberg:  It was EW who "made" the contract|pg||
nt|barnets: west bid 3@C and north tried 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: after 5 boards poland lead finland 25 5 |pg||
nt|dburn: but I expect he probably could - the operator didn't keep a low club, but I expect Lauria did|pg||

mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: 6nt by south my preferred contract|pg||

nt|geot: if South gets two heart ruffs|pg||
nt|mcphee: may have been worried about @S 5/3|pg||

nt|sastro: @h Ausspiel bereitet Probleme|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah trump protion on @D LEAD|pg||
pc|s9|nt|begse: they can send in 3 min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C asks total controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gulyas: ok, this will probably end in 13 tricks|pg||
nt|james_h: 1@H shows 4+@s, 1@s shows 3 card support|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like 11 tricks to me|pg||
nt|psyck: @d looks likely lead|pg||
nt|baardolav: And a good distribution 4252|pg||
nt|james_h: /joking :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: operator got that last call wrong|pg||
nt|geot: 5 making because the heart finesse works fine|pg||
nt|lesniak: prawdopodobnie z tym Adam powiedzialby 5 trefli po 4 kier...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ryskiel_: niewiele siê dzieje na boisku|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H=3  [2@C promised 2+]|pg||
nt|james_h: 2@d a relay I think|pg||
nt|geot: Only one imp at stake here, the overtrick|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is easier for Madala to find @h lead|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck: did well to lead it even after W probably showed @d stopper|pg||
nt|solex333: garozzo: "never lead ur singleton" :)|pg||
nt|james_h: in this hand, I think both souths must drive to at least 5, but its easy for me to say that|pg||
nt|osvaill83: he can fail that finesse, after one discard |pg||
nt|riccho:  I could see it, when I worked as a TD in Bad Honnef (Champions Cup 2011) |pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: if memory serves  4@S now asks  Denial Cue Bidding|pg||
nt|jbennet: 6nt a decent contract . (lots of chances but communication problems. espeially if a heart is lead.)|pg||
nt|geot: I am not sure about the Italian style here, a reverse by opener (?) |pg||
nt|barnets: even a diamond breaks communication for a squeeze|pg||
nt|barnets: in pointed suits|pg||
nt|riccho:  looks like a one trick defeat here. But the 13th club may give declarer the 8th trick, if EW are not unbarrying the @d sometimes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can imagine - both teams demonstrate professional and sportsmen's attitude to the game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|james_h: I'm told 1@s is 2/3 card support|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 2@D GF artificial, Sylvan wrote for Mesbur|pg||
nt|james_h: Tx Martin|pg||
nt|geot: 4@S played by West at the other table|pg||
nt|star6ija: as we are 12 behind I am jealoused for every IMP Italians won|pg||
nt|geot: but he must guess the hearts if he gets the clubs established, which he will|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: so Muller will show control in @C but not @D  [don't quote me]|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Wijs writing lots of explanations for Nunes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs may have enough information now to try 7@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: knows @HA @CK  and 2326 distribution|pg||
nt|geot: 11 tops tricks|pg||
nt|geot: now four heart tricks|pg||
nt|geot: has to guess whether to take the heart finesse or the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: how does h finesse help|pg||
nt|jbennet: so east can (a) win in dummy spade king and play clubs (that requires 3-3 spade break.)|pg||
nt|barnets: he is blocked from his long clubs|pg||
nt|geot: not much communications between the hands here|pg||
nt|geot: if they duck the first club|pg||
nt|jbennet: or b) win in hand, but more less requires d 3-3 + queen onside. |pg||
nt|jbennet: so sp 3-3 looks like the best chance.|pg||
nt|geot: What if he takes the first heart, finesses the heart 9, cash the two last hearts and the spade king and play a club|pg||
nt|geot: I mean if North plays the jack|pg||
nt|geot: and he should not?|pg||
nt|geot: everything blocked|pg||
nt|jbennet: hseems like best play is to win in dummy  and then immdiately play a club to the king (hpoing that south will win).|pg||
nt|geot: if North plays low in hearts (or the 7)|pg||
nt|barnets: def just duck a club|pg||
nt|barnets: that does not work|pg||
nt|riccho:  very true|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|geot: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: WHOOPS THEY DIDNT CASH THE SPADE|pg||
nt|dburn: no matter|pg||
nt|dburn: if South pitches a spade East plays a fourth diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: which naturally South will ruff high, then run the ten of hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and then the director will take his copy of the hand records away|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|famus: so the bd was all abt bidding --a push now|pg||
nt|chick: a balanced hand can have 4 spades :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: in monaco-russia, monaco missed the grand|pg||
nt|geot: very hard hand for declaer to analyze|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tez: davet etmek için kontr denmeli 3@h e|pg||
nt|nilsland:  board 7 was only 1 overtrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is not an advertisement for 1nt not forcing|pg||
nt|clinch: Just a @h to lose now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 7@s is obvious then|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer may establish a heart for the 12th|pg||
nt|jbennet: heart king, club to the king and spade|pg||
nt|chick: and the nice part is that partner can leave it in if he doesn't|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcphee: nice  to see that 10@D fall|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: renk tekrarý deðil|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: after thius lost the play john won next trick and south the trick after|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: two rounds of spades have been played and a heart lead fron south|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: there are still three hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: john wins the heart ace|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzgn: claim three light|pg||
nt|fluffy: it will be a kind of mind game if helgemo didn't play a heart|pg||
nt|osvaill83: well, it is anyhow|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: better was establish clubs for decl|pg||
nt|barnets: wishing he had passed 5@DX|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: S has encouraged and N discouraged hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer may have a clue|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and in this board, declarer has difficulties with communications|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
mc|11|nt|jbennet: no unleished the spade first.|pg||
nt|fluffy: a friend says that the 5@d bid with 2 spades points towards @hA in north|pg||
pg||
