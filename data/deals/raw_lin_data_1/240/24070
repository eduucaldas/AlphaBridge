nt|niekbrink: 10 or 11 tricks for EW in hearts. On a good day (club lead, guessing hearts) you might make 12|pg||

nt|pauleger: (forcing)|pg||

nt|pauleger: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|niekbrink: remarkable enough no polish pairs in the top 10 at the moment|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Klukowsky - Zatorsi being the best polish pair at the 11th position|pg||
nt|pauleger: that really looks like a Dutch name :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  Hi Henri - your boys are doing well in U-20: No 1 and all 4 in Top-16|pg||
nt|niekbrink: To remind you all, top 20 qualifies for tomorrows 57-board final|pg||

nt|pelu:  no :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: seems like 7NT for NS. 9 clubs,2 spades, 1 diamond, 1 heart|pg||
nt|pauleger: following the "rule" 6-4 bid one more :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Yes!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|niekbrink: so 4 diamonds?|pg||
nt|pelu:  wow |pg||
nt|vugraphzje: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Vejle/microSite/Asp/PairsPlayersResultsDynamicCum.asp?qtournid=926&qphase=2 for live results|pg||
nt|pelu:  that will make life hard for NS|pg||
mb|3H|mb|5D|nt|pauleger: Are these the boards from the goulash - tournament we broadcasted from Russia? (I believe it was last year)|pg||
nt|pelu:  only 1 out of 5 :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: My guess is that any 7 will score huge for NS|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|pelu:  I exp that max 3 E will open 3@d|pg||
nt|niekbrink: there will be no uncontested auctions in a junior tournament|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|niekbrink: of course I meant any making 7....|pg||
nt|pauleger: Everybody will discuss their actions on this board at the bar this evening|pg||
nt|niekbrink: and claim...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner can bid 6@C, maybe South has a raise|pg||
mc|13|nt|pelu:  even if East pass - the normal bid - its difficult to bid to 7|pg||
nt|pauleger: In the other room the auction went 2@c (weak in @d) - 2@h - 3@d - 6@c all pass|pg||
nt|niekbrink: south has 2 small diamonds...|pg||
nt|niekbrink: not sure N has first round control|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps two blackwoods do the job, if left alone|pg||
nt|pelu:  ofter 4Nt would be with @hs as trumf - so S could have @HAK and no @sK|pg||
nt|ritong: a rare case of useful BW with a void|pg||
nt|pelu:  no @sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: 2½ min for next round|pg||
nt|ritong: well, if EW do not interfere, maybe north can impose @cs then ask about keys|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that one pair bid to 7NT and took all the MPs|pg||
nt|pauleger: I wonder if anybody is playing game on this board :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I like Madej's approach|pg||
nt|pelu:  if u have to bid 3@S - then do it first time - more pressure on opp|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3@s is too much in direct bidding. If X shows a 2@s bid, that´s my choice|pg||
nt|ritong: if his intention is competing later on, i think immediate 3@s can work better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu:  100% agre Henri - pass only give opp space|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, his side has @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: so his decision is: whose hand is this?|pg||
nt|pelu:  a direct 3@S dont promise values - he can X first or bid new suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: most play doubling cue shows like Hx|pg||
nt|ritong: in the suit|pg||
nt|ritong: a sort of lead director|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low from a doubleton is standard in Poland|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu:  and 3@S = I would have bid 2@s|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I can't see NS this making|pg||
nt|pauleger: Would you bid 3@s directly at same vulnerability, too?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu:  but 3@s could also be down 1 - that better :)|pg||
nt|ritong: good point, paul|pg||
nt|niekbrink: specs pointing out that west doesn't have an entry for his heart to cash|pg||
nt|pelu:  N has to play W for @cJ and East for @cK - = discard on the 4.@c (@hJ)|pg||
