nt|adriaantje: but it will still be hard to bid|pg||
nt|pelu:  good news for N if 4@h tel: no @D cue|pg||
nt|adriaantje: if they stick to a small slam, they should bid 6@S and not 6@C|pg||

nt|pelu:  the key-card for N is @sQ|pg||

mb|2N|an| |nt|niekbrink: good system test for EW here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|nt|adriaantje: probably Michaels now, as N didn't support @C immediately|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|pelu:  fine lead by W|pg||
nt|niekbrink: quick 3 NT |pg||

nt|niekbrink: the 9 of clubs is onside for declarer, so he stops the clubs twice|pg||
nt|pelu:  better played by N - and some help in trick 1|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|niekbrink: 8 tricks from top... Lots of possibilities to create a 9th|pg||

nt|pelu:  @d9 great help for S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|niekbrink: 8 of diamonds can be 9th trick|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Might also seduce S to take a spadefinesse, when he sees @d length with W|pg||

nt|Vugraphzjf: y|pg||
nt|Vugraphzjf: im typing correct here :)|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Without @s 9 in hand best mathematical way you should finesse with the 10 since you cant cope with Jx in West. Isolated that is|pg||

pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzjf: :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  why not just a normal bid, Adriaan?|pg||
nt|adriaantje: because it was alerted|pg||
nt|niekbrink: although the trump suit is not really great, the lay out of the hand is quite ok for EW|pg||
nt|mbruun:  A lot of players overcalls on a decent 5s suit and 12 HCP. At least in Denmark thats the case |pg||
nt|pelu:  I didn't see alert|pg||
nt|adriaantje: 2@C wasn't alerted because it was natural I think :)|pg||
