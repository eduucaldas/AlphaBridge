nt|henryb:  I think he might solve it. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Or rather, perhaps he should. He knows declarer has at least three spades, two clubs, and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|henryb:  as winners. So the only hope is that declarer has the stiff @hK|pg||

nt|prasun1966: N will have to believe the @S10 to make this contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  He needs three more tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of these can come from the fourth spade, but he still needs two tricks from somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  both play and defense will be interesting|pg||

pc|h7|nt|mackulky:  now quick claim for 11|pg||
