nt|henryb:  GM, or here GN|pg||
nt|figo:  thin lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: FORMIDABLE 56 UP|pg||
nt|figo:  a game plus as some would say |pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  The same line up for Manyawar |pg||
nt|henryb:  I'll comment for a while if you would like|pg||
nt|figo:  but not much over 14 boards set |pg||
mb|1D|nt|prasun1966: Indian Railway is leading by as we all see, 18 imps|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|figo:  rv tempted to bid on |pg||
nt|r_tibre: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: GOOD MORNING ALL OF YOU|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  A tricky problem for E. I am sure we would all bid 3N, but 4@s is a much better contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||
nt|jain: missing akj pd bidding 4d,difficult to stop below game|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mackulky:  mminor part score tussle |pg||
nt|figo:  decl will be pleased |pg||
nt|jain: hmm friendly lead nd made|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  better than friendly - the only lead to allow the contract to make|pg||
nt|jain: fans of texan aces overjoyed for sure:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: TEST|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb:  I don't know how to get there|pg||
pc|d8|nt|figo:  how many wont lead  SA ? thats a Q worth asking |pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzhz: GOOD MORNING ALL|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Good Morning everybody|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 2@S here is 4-4 minor opening hand |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  Now a tricky problem for S.|pg||
nt|prasun1966: ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he might solve it. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Or rather, perhaps he should. He knows declarer has at least three spades, two clubs, and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|henryb:  as winners. So the only hope is that declarer has the stiff @hK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was counting tricks|pg||
nt|thak: hi|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|mackulky:  easy 9 tricks for Raju |pg||
nt|thak: declarer probably wd've been happier to be in 3N|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Pd ship has been changed for both team  DSM has brought Arun and Suhas and Manas and Subir for Rail|pg||
pc|dA|nt|r_tibre: hoping for a more interesting set of deals, and more lively action|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s4|pc|c2|nt|thak: @DA and a @S he needs to get it right|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|prasun1966: difficult for S to take @SA and Play @HA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  And if declarer has only the stiff @hK. he will have five diamonds, therefore ...|pg||
nt|thak: will need to guess anyway|pg||
nt|thak: with @D J not surviving|pg||
nt|thak: not knowing the 4-1 break, he's likely to play @CA , T to J planning to ruff @H 9 and a @S pitch on @D J|pg||
nt|r_tibre: -2|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzhz: PLAY WAS DELAYED DUE TO APEAL|pg||

nt|jaggys: also a bit pushy...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|suketbombi: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: 3nt +3 is too many tricks to east west:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: in CR|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jaggys: again the nebulous D opening cost..as defence didnt lead a C|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jaggys: big danger...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaggys: ashok assumed that partner had a S fit..which he shdnt have|pg||
nt|suketbombi: this will not work a @C ruff + 3 obvious tricks|pg||
nt|adonis18:  defence probably take first 4 tricks|pg||
nt|jaggys: he shd have tried 2 Nt..and would be raised to 3|pg||

nt|sandipdang:  with contract right sided 6nt shd roll home always|pg||
nt|r_tibre: EW score 3@S, so nothing lost|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: HI ALL BBO STARTED LATER THAN GAME SO COULD NOT COVER PROPERLY|pg||
mb|p|nt|r_tibre: gm all, thanks Pramod|pg||
mb|1D|nt|r_tibre: Rail off to a good start|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mackulky:  EW can get ypto 4@S |pg||
nt|psyck: other room seems to be having some connection problems|pg||
nt|sunit:  ew cant score anything on a spade lead not even 2sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|thak: this was strange, if laltu held @SA, he'd surely 've held onto winner @D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|prasun1966: E and W r playing Strong @C  while NS r playing 2/1|pg||
nt|r_tibre: tough choice over 3@D.... no alternative seems really good|pg||
mb|p|nt|thak: @S problem was resolved for suhas, and he still got it wrong..|pg||
mb|2S|nt|thak: imaginative raise by arun|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe operator will let us know if 2@d showed just @s or something more|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  North is likely to play this in 2N or 3N after opening 2N in fourth seat|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s likely as @h raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  After two rounds of @d, he has 3@s, 1@h, 1@d and 1@c|pg||
nt|prasun1966: N will have to believe the @S10 to make this contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  He needs three more tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of these can come from the fourth spade, but he still needs two tricks from somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  both play and defense will be interesting|pg||
nt|mackulky:  but I believe Declerer should prevail in the end|pg||
nt|figo:  E hand better than just a sign off |pg||
nt|psyck: anyway normal contract reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  hi Pramod|pg||
nt|mackulky:  and all kibitzers|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: HI|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sunit:  on board 57|pg||
nt|r_tibre: right... is @S lead obvious is the question|pg||
nt|sunit:  on a @S lead west can score @S's and 2 @C's|pg||
pc|h4|nt|thak: will they land in @Hs now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  the only place is hearts, which is possible if the @hK is onside|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Last hand also S led @HQ|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|henryb:  but he needs two entries to dummy|pg||
nt|thak: powerful @D spots with NS|pg||
nt|sunit:  5@s's and 2 @C's|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|jain: hi all|pg||
nt|r_tibre: def cant do much wrong from here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mackulky:  this should be over soon @H blocked|pg||
pc|sA|nt|r_tibre: DSM got off to a good start yesterday, Rail came back with a better performance in the 2nd set... we have 4x14 today to decide the winner|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|thak: sdh still be -1, too many black suit losers|pg||
nt|thak: ..|pg||
nt|thak: that's quite a pause|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mackulky:  and @C hons placed favourably|pg||
nt|henryb:  And as Prasun said, that means he needs to take the @s finesse also|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|figo:  no D from N ...........|pg||
pc|h8|nt|r_tibre: for those not familiar with indian bridge teams, EW are regular members of DSM... |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d3|nt|jain: nice 3s from west left N with not much of a choice|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  which he did not|pg||
nt|thak: previous board was worth 13 to Railway as manas and subir played in 3N|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cT|nt|prasun1966: Yes inserting the @S10 was the only way|pg||

nt|prasun1966: Initially it seemed to be a cold 2@S|pg||
nt|psyck: Pramod say 2@d was @s Inv+|pg||

mb|1H|nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||

nt|baldjean: 5@c is a good sacrifice here|pg||
nt|r_tibre: quite shapely first few deals this set|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  I think it is close between 5@d and 6@d as E over 4@h|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 6@d from E i suppose|pg||
nt|henryb:  Back up, operator|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 45 IMPS diff but not impossible in 14brds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit:  3nt can make fron N hand on a dia lead|pg||

nt|psyck: this time Inv+ in @c|pg||
nt|figo:  fine |pg||
nt|psyck: lot of work to be done|pg||
nt|psyck: inv+ = invitational hand or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|r_tibre: S has to be careful on a @H lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|alok_daga: Laltu in deep thought I guess ,with 14hcp with him,all bidding.but seems they o\board|pg||
nt|thak: declarer has no entry to table, so will have to concede an open @C trick alongwith a @H, a@S and 2 @Ds|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mackulky:  well played N|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nkgupt: is a phantom anyway|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes indeed|pg||
nt|henryb:  but a trick is 5 imps in a close match|pg||
nt|nkgupt: texans fast loosing the ground|pg||
pc|c5|nt|prasun1966: Good push to 3@D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mackulky:  with no count in Spades tough return for Ajay|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, just aaw for myself that 4@s is down|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mackulky:  third spade|pg||
nt|mackulky:  to kill the winner|pg||
nt|mackulky:  had Raju played a trump at trick 2 and Ajay retun Spade |pg||
nt|r_tibre: yes|pg||
nt|sunit:  ns pair have been playing some good agressive bridge|pg||
nt|sunit:  and are duly rewarded more often for the past couple of days|pg||
pc|h5|nt|thak: defence will need to play @D after winning @S A|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|mackulky:  it wud be -2 but no reaon to do it |pg||

nt|r_tibre: though... declarer cant come to 9 even if @Hs blocked|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|prasun1966: To take the quick tricks against opps' slam is most common gesture of almost everybody:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Rajesh also did not find the heart play on Bd 57. He gave himself less chance, though, by grabbing the first spade|pg||

nt|adonis18:  he only lacks pooints and tricks:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but his intentions are good tho|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: what if manas jumped to 6@h?|pg||
nt|jaggys: pass wins 7 /dbl wins 12/bid gets him to lose a bunch..|pg||
nt|adonis18:  S must admit, there's no morale in this|pg||
nt|suketbombi: so 2@C was majors as I suspected:0|pg||

nt|suketbombi: 6 More imps to rail who are now on the fast Track:)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|subhranp:  hi prasun|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  5@C makes folks unless @S ace is underled and @H comes back - unlikely|pg||
nt|r_tibre: S is the sponsor of the DSM team... EW play for DSM normally... required to rep Rail here as they are employed with Rail|pg||
nt|r_tibre: which raises at least a few question marks over the format of the trials... and surely not for the first/last time|pg||

mb|3C|nt|mackulky:  a game for EW |pg||

nt|r_tibre: 1N a limit raise in @Cs?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mackulky:  and Texan are in an early lead|pg||

nt|r_tibre: 4@S has some play if trumps not led?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: from the face it looks like he will easily roll home but what happens on a spade lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|alok_daga: transfer to clubs they play tr on 1sp o\c|pg||
mb|p|nt|figo:  1H relay here |pg||

nt|figo:  1C is art strong |pg||
nt|sunit:  no game contract can make here for ew|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mackulky:  shud be home with the evn break in @H|pg||
nt|jain: but for sure a very shabby opening by E.precision players just open on any 11 counts:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: hello all|pg||
nt|mackulky:  kaizad got to the best lead|pg||
nt|mackulky:  hello|pg||

nt|alok_daga: Sandeep has not done justice to his hand|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 5@C was makeable for EW|pg||
nt|r_tibre: i think both being alittle tentative... bound to be in a not so regular partnership|pg||
nt|alok_daga: his p has at best 2spades after the 2sp xle so where r the losers?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: But what welse W could have done|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 3@H-3@S?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: He has transferred and said 2@S also|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Rajesh let me crrect u.these 2 play as a pair for Rail for the last 2years|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  no return seems interesting for Venkatesh may be he will @S|pg||
nt|r_tibre: how many times in a year?|pg||

nt|prasun1966: 14 x 6  |pg||

nt|vugraphzhz: BREAK HERE|pg||
nt|r_tibre: wd for 1 imp|pg||
nt|r_tibre: hi Prasun, wc :)|pg||
nt|sunit:  ns lost on a chance to collect penalties here|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||
nt|figo:  it was reasonable line , to try make 9 tricks |pg||
nt|sunit:  even 3@C x is 300|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: this 4h is on..|pg||
nt|mackulky:  with a flat featureless hand but Ajay must have been alured by the @D suit as 3@D might have shown @D values with 4@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not beating 6@h three cost E-W 4 imps|pg||
nt|subhranp:  precision 1D|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 1@H normal?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jain: but not sure if they reach|pg||
nt|prasun1966: If Laltu would have been declairer here, he also would have got the @C lead and made|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jain: may b on a @C lead or @C shift it wont |pg||
nt|subhranp:  6s possible here for NS|pg||
nt|figo:  or max 1 down |pg||
nt|prasun1966: 2@H? = weak i think|pg||
nt|r_tibre: yes, @C lead normal.... i personally prefer 2@H over 1@H.. makes it more difficult for EW|pg||
nt|r_tibre: S has a clear 3@H bid in my books|pg||
mb|d|nt|sunsamvar: a kib suggests that walmart is a bigger employer than Indian Railways... but i am sure that IR has a better bridge team|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 5@D on it seems.. do u reach it? or do opps help u push up to it?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: But here E cannot keep himself abstained from bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: 4@S cannot make  If Ajay can find out a @C lead and continuation|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Yes in favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 4@S has play i think|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mackulky:  another part score|pg||
nt|jain: another x or 3nt|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  yes - timing important|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 4@S is makeable  it shows apparently|pg||
nt|r_tibre: the see-saw battle continues... Rail wrest 6 back|pg||
nt|r_tibre: they bid the cold 4@H on 32|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Difficult for E to enter here|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: HE IS THINKING HARD|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Still it is difficult to bid 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: interesting hand|pg||
nt|mackulky:  aggressive action by Venkatesh wins |pg||
mb|2D|nt|r_tibre: he may even give NS a few unfreindly glances... wow, a brave dbl|pg||
nt|prasun1966: :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3@c makes also|pg||
nt|figo:  with 5332 and 3 card M fit , many raise major with 3 cards |pg||
mb|2H|nt|r_tibre: will he push further?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: I guessed that Laltu would|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: 4c seems par|pg||
nt|jain: 3s makes 4c 1 dwn|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think E should bid 2@c over 1@s|pg||
nt|subhranp:  good lead, this will save a trick|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2@C must be gf checkback\|pg||
nt|figo:  and check back avalable to pd but here not needed |pg||
nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Hi|pg||
nt|r_tibre: Hi Daga jee, wc|pg||
mb|4H|nt|alok_daga: hi Prasun,Rajesh|pg||
nt|r_tibre: Sumit arguably has the best table presence among indian bridge players, laltu showing us he is not far behind|pg||
nt|prasun1966: On a @S lead, 3@S is even tough  i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: although declarer has 6 losers, he can still make if he can avoid east from getting on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: i feel he will bid 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: They donot play 2 way checkback, it seem|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well bid|pg||
nt|sunit:  i would bid 2nt with the south hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: best contract and rightsided too|pg||
nt|sunit:  2dia endplays partner with such hands|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  Ajay should cash the @hA to see what signal partner gives, then switch back to @c|pg||
nt|henryb:  If E had a doubleton @h and the @s8 he could beat 3@s|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  after 4 @C thers no stopping keyzad - well bid aces|pg||
nt|figo:  carding udca for EW|pg||
nt|subhranp:  dont agree with the 4d bid here of South|pg||
pc|sA|nt|subhranp:  requires careful play to make this|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  will make|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 4@S cannot make|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3nt ie... 4@S shd be down|pg||
nt|psyck: some prefer more shape, & most have means of clarifying on what the raise was on|pg||
nt|r_tibre: ns playing strong @C apparently|pg||
pc|s4|nt|alok_daga: as I remarked 2 Prasun in pvt trump lead in the auctions create a lot of problems|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sandipdang:  @s k then diamonds?|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  probably best line|pg||
nt|subhranp:  he has to figure out the best line of play for spade 3-1|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  or ruff a club and a heart in dummy?|pg||
nt|alok_daga: these|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mackulky:  4@H is not clearcut for EW |pg||
nt|prasun1966: Surprising  with only 11 and 2cards @S  no point of pulling the 3NT into 4@S|pg||
nt|psyck: here with those majors, it was a clear raise for me|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mackulky:  but NS did well to buy it in 2@S|pg||
nt|arunbapat: I do not understand insistance of playing the hand in 4S.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|henryb:  I guess that is hard to see|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Now 4 md|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|r_tibre: i dont agree with Arun's pass... p did make a t/o dbl, and has at best 1 @h|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Laltu will not make mistake to cash @HA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|vugraphzhz: BREAK HERE|pg||
nt|figo:  as some specs have said , flattish boards so far |pg||
nt|figo:  no real ' action ' for kibs :)|pg||
nt|psyck: this is just the preamble :)|pg||
nt|psyck: enough board to follow & surely these players will liven it up|pg||
nt|figo:  anyway , I dont rate these players to bid with lot of ' masala ' |pg||
nt|figo:  they will be more on ' steady ' side , atleast for now |pg||
nt|figo:  where r they ?|pg||
nt|psyck: the different styles of bidding & judgement will be enough to produce some swings soon|pg||
pc|s2|nt|r_tibre: agree.. declarer has little choice other than going after @Cs|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes but EW atleast should have found a way to compete further|pg||
nt|mackulky:  the lead of texan Aces narrows down |pg||
nt|sandipdang:  this works too|pg||
nt|subhranp:  North could have bid 5c on the way to 5d|pg||
nt|r_tibre: i may even venture 3@H-p-p-3@S in case p dbled w 5 @ss|pg||
pc|cA|nt|prasun1966: Slowly turning into Texan's favour|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :).. |pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|subhranp: diamond switch was required|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: coup possible... but has to read cards thru the back|pg||
nt|arunbapat: will RV play on Trump coup|pg||
nt|arunbapat: I think he will |pg||
nt|subhranp:  meanwhile texans have gained 10imps on 46|pg||
pc|cK|pc|hT|nt|r_tibre: 1@D-x showed 5-8, 2@D gen. force.. at no point S showed @D values|pg||

nt|r_tibre: a minor slam here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|subhranp: if declarer had ducked the first club he would have always made|pg||
nt|alok_daga: a swing of 19 IMPS |pg||
mb|1S|nt|figo:  ironically , these opposing pairs were teammates at summer national that took place before these trials |pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Mohan forgot they play weak nt in this situation, they only play it nv vs. vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: very chatty table|pg||

mb|p|nt|jain: with 4 trumps not my choice to lead  short suit|pg||

nt|jaggys: once N cue bids 4 H and key cards are found 7 will be bid|pg||
nt|pappoo: not sure they will get there though!|pg||
nt|r_tibre: a conservative 1N by W on 34, allows NS to compete to winning @H, and another 7 imps for rail|pg||
nt|prasun1966: He will have to pass now  no way|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 3@H*|pg||
nt|prasun1966: :( another option ofcourse|pg||
nt|prasun1966: with 20|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nkgupt: looks like -1|pg||
nt|subhranp:  this looks like another bad board for Railways|pg||

nt|vugraphzhz: 4 SESSIONS TODAY AND 2 TOMORROW HALF DAY REST TOMORROW|pg||

nt|pappoo: so a possible swing to railways|pg||
nt|thak: that was a very unexpected and uncharacteristic line of play|pg||
nt|psyck: at least we are getting swingly boards now, one way or the other|pg||
nt|thak: any time finesse is going to be advantageous, ruff works equally well|pg||
nt|figo:  that was ' reverse swing ' though |pg||
nt|subhranp:  railways have bid 6d on B21 and picked up 13 imps|pg||
nt|alok_daga: brb|pg||
mb|1D|nt|arunbapat: I do not get why RV did not play CA and back..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N shd hv returned @H instead of @S and RV shd have cashed @Ha|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: same contract here too|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 6@s is a decent one 75%  suppose|pg||
nt|pappoo: 4H is a possible make here|pg||
nt|thak: finesse  could only lose and never gain|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|sunsamvar: or even duck the 1st @C arunji|pg||
nt|arunbapat: that would have made situaton clear to N and even to RV|pg||
mb|2D|nt|prasun1966: No slammish hand is noticed as yet  except deal no 5|pg||
nt|subhranp:  this could end in a quiet 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: going to be unlucky for NS|pg||
nt|thak: another slam?|pg||
nt|thak: can make 7 dbl dummy on HT hook and minor suit sqz|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 4@S allowed on 35 in OR.. so match level with 49 deals to score|pg||
mb|2H|nt|subhranp: should be a comfortable 3nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: opening hand facing opening hand for n/s... will they reach game ?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: e/w not making it easy for them|pg||
mb|2S|nt|prasun1966: Now they may bid 6 with 6-5 @S fit  N may proceed further|pg||
nt|arunbapat: May be P has 5431 shape |pg||
nt|figo:  quanti |pg||
nt|psyck: 3 trumps & 7 controls...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jain: shd b 1 dwn on the std lead of @C K|pg||
nt|mackulky:  with Railways and DSM already prequalified as the two Semi finalists , they have to find two more Semi finalists from the remaining teams i.e. Manyawar , Texan Aces , Formidables and Poddar Developers|pg||
nt|figo:  will last deal be playing on laltu's mind?|pg||
nt|thak: he'll really need to struggle to mess this one up :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: PLAY GOING ON HOW CAN I TELL?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jain: nd shd suffer the same fate|pg||
nt|mackulky:  may be unless he takes a trump reduction line but apparantly there is no clue for that |pg||
nt|jain: rana will play heart after winning hoping to ruff the third heart nd also hoping trumps to behave|pg||
nt|jain: usually rana is a very quick player|pg||
pc|d2|nt|prasun1966: Yes it is:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as per one kib state of the match sud stop them from bidding a 75% slam:)|pg||
nt|subhranp:  meanwhile texans have gained 11imps on B49 as IR pair missed the slam in the other room|pg||
nt|figo:  predict at your own risk sandeep :)|pg||
nt|thak: nah, no risk, hand plays itself|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sandipdang:  the problem with aggressive openings is exemplified by this hand|pg||

nt|alok_daga: As Hamman says 70%bidding 25%defence-this set this 25%has resulted in a swing of 50+|pg||
mb|1S|nt|subhranp:  Texans can potentially wipe out the lead on B50 and B51|pg||

nt|thak: his overcall will have the effect of transferring @H declaration to W|pg||
mb|p|nt|sandipdang:  diamond partial here?|pg||

nt|nkgupt: mb not to make but for make / save for -1|pg||
nt|figo:  arun must be saying sorry to suhas |pg||
nt|psyck: surprised at the play, Arun is normally very good|pg||
nt|thak: perhaps arun happy to settle for -50 given that he doesn't see 4@H being defended..|pg||
nt|figo:  ok friends , gtg now , happy viewing , bye |pg||
nt|nkgupt: ruffing low hardly made any sense:)|pg||
nt|prasun1966: deal no 37  Sandip and Banerjee is in 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: BREAK HERE|pg||
nt|prasun1966: ok|pg||
nt|alok_daga: brd no 42 a biggie-not seen a 12 trick hand in a v long time|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 4@S-1 wud have been good |pg||
nt|r_tibre: 41 seems a + for rail|pg||
nt|r_tibre: match still too close to call... ur picks alok n prasun?|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Personally i think Rail will prevail|pg||
nt|r_tibre: i wud say 3:2 for rail|pg||
nt|alok_daga: this set had N\Shere been more inspired they cud have developed a gud lead|pg||
nt|r_tibre: looks like will be a 2-session affair|pg||
mb|1S|nt|subhranp:  5d would have been easier to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pappoo: 6S   6Nt can both make here|pg||
nt|psyck: Thx Arvind|pg||
nt|r_tibre: dsm cud go into 5th w/ a tiny lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|r_tibre: arun and suhas cud create some swings in the coming sets|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|mackulky:  so Manyawar still have some space to make up some|pg||
nt|prasun1966: EW can make 4@H  high-card doesnot permit though|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Difficult for N to enter into here in vulnerable position and would be dengerous also |pg||
mb|3H|nt|jain: x by s?not  many's choice for sure|pg||
nt|thak: 6 hands no swing in a row. don't see that every day..|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: after 3 sets, formidables were leading 89-63 |pg||
nt|prasun1966: Great Satya took the right decision|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 6@H on here?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: y|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|psyck: 4 swingly deals follow though|pg||
nt|r_tibre: true alok... not bidding cold games not winning tactics|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: NEXT SET AT 12.15|pg||
mb|3N|nt|subhranp:  that is some aggressive bidding and as the cards are it makes.|pg||
nt|pappoo: will probably go 3NT 4NT and north has to decide whether to go on|pg||
nt|nkgupt: suspect all one way|pg||
nt|psyck: could well be|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  good lead|pg||
nt|jain: trump lead|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mackulky:  what will RV play after winning?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: why not jain? what will u bid ?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: What will Arun read, this 4@D?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: has to just ruff a @S and claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: pass 1s|pg||
nt|r_tibre: that lead secures 7 tricks.. shd be a fast claim|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mackulky:  the defense started on correct foot and RV needs to comliment it by @H Q or 9 |pg||
nt|nkgupt: 8 they played @s part making only 9|pg||
nt|thak: here comes first of those|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 4@H makes  they r a little bit agressive now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  is there any news on the position of the other match ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: NO|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe more dangerous to come in over 2@S or 2@H|pg||
nt|r_tibre: thats what i was expecting from arun and suhas :)|pg||
nt|r_tibre: shd be @H fit.... for crossing 3n|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Nobody but Arun only could have shown his @C cue|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|mackulky:  well done|pg||
nt|subhranp:  6s is on|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  yes but is anybody going to get there?|pg||
nt|pappoo: this probably shows some interest and a 5 card suit    i am guessing i do not know their methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp:  well if anyone wants to recover then can reach there|pg||
nt|pappoo: other room stopped in 3NT so a likey 13 imp pickup for the texans!|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: Good Bid:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sandipdang:  shd be 12 trks easy|pg||
nt|thak: 7 to DSM for aggressive bidding and good guessing|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mackulky:  nw a duck |pg||
nt|pappoo: shud play back a club|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 55 also can only be a + for dsm|pg||
nt|r_tibre: :)|pg||
nt|r_tibre: @D9 a good card|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 4@S should be @S and @C cue here  as pd has demanded the @C cue|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pappoo: putting the declarer to test|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|subhranp: can make 6 here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|mackulky:  all caards favourable for W and shud be duplicated|pg||
nt|prasun1966: wd|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mackulky:  it looks Raju will manage at the most 4 tricks and may be a fifth by some endplay if the defense falters |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|r_tibre: agree|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nkgupt: what time next set pramod jee|pg||

pc|s9|nt|mackulky:  the pther table  the declerer managed 3|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Now? may be +1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|r_tibre: vinay knows how crucial every imp may be in the final analysis and going for that ot|pg||
nt|prasun1966: This 6@H may give them, good imps, supposedly|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|arunbapat: another 5 imps to Manyavar..|pg||
nt|kista:  12 imps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mackulky:  so a minor swing of 3 imps to manyawar|pg||
pc|hK|nt|prasun1966: 2@H was only there  if N could have played the 2nd @C|pg||
nt|r_tibre: will be up to sumit and laltu again|pg||
nt|r_tibre: claim|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Yes can be claimed:)|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mackulky:  after the first pass|pg||
nt|subhranp: another slam hand here|pg||
nt|mackulky:  yes if they find it |pg||
nt|mackulky:  the other table could not|pg||
nt|subhranp:  another slam here|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  now this looks like an interesting slam possibility again|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  modern 2 @S opener here|pg||
nt|pappoo: a routine game hand here so it seems everything will come down to the last deal here!|pg||
mb|p|nt|r_tibre: result on 51 not what i expected|pg||
mb|1D|nt|prasun1966: .|pg||
nt|r_tibre: those still wondering... 5@Ds + 6 trumps + 1 @S is what N scored|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: Now, Again Texans may be ahead|pg||

mb|1H|nt|figo:  the session deciders now , 2 in a  row |pg||
nt|nkgupt: expect score to end at 130/125 ( leading 5 for tex )|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: BRD 53 AND 54 MAY GO IN TEXANS WAY|pg||
nt|kista:  If NS pick upa penalty here instead of bidding the game|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 42 brds to go a lead of 17 odd still anyones match|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: ok they found it.)|pg||
nt|mackulky:  I think it all hinges what quality of 3 level openings pasrtnershuops agree to at Vul first seat|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Sumit thinking will this be a push?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mackulky:  partnerships|pg||
nt|mackulky:  first oor second seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  some more imps to fotmidables |pg||
nt|prasun1966: What does 4@S show?  good @C support? oh!|pg||
nt|prasun1966: some imps for Rail  7/8|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 5m goes for only 500... 4@S not cold of course|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Yes Rajesh me too  but anything can happen on bridge table|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  formidables sorry mistype|pg||
nt|mackulky:  well done |pg||
nt|alok_daga: so the lead is 18 unless someone gets tempted on brd no 42|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sga1: This board shud be 12 imps to Texans so equal and then 5 imps on the last board|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 4 @h sud hav a play i think|pg||
nt|psyck: Bhabesh in 6@s on deal 9 other room|pg||
nt|thak: can laltu make this and make up a little for going down in slam|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sandipdang:  manyavar close the gap on this bd|pg||
pc|sA|nt|prasun1966: good lead|pg||
nt|r_tibre: dangerous to get in now.. and N does well to resist |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|arunbapat: 12 imps|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Yes|pg||
nt|arunbapat: so match will be tied 125/125|pg||
nt|prasun1966: A 'push' board hopefully|pg||
nt|pappoo: possible 2 imps to railways here|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|psyck: yes play could go similar to other room with just @h finesse extra to make 4@h here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|subhranp:  West in the other room prefering to treat the hand as weak 2 hand and stayed a level lower.|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Yes B42 is a very tempting hand  :)  somedays 7 can be bidded|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 4@S makes|pg||
pc|c8|nt|prasun1966: In the other Semi-Final  TexanAces is playing against Indian Railway|pg||
nt|prasun1966: -1 or '='  let us see|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any run from 1ntX as on the other tbl they wud be in 300 zone .....|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mackulky:  he decides to play for the split hon in @H|pg||
nt|subhranp:  not sure who is at fault but they got to go back and discuss this|pg||
nt|subhranp:  railways have gained 6imps on B24 to take the lead as the DSM pair in the other room played in 2H and went down|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mackulky:  well this shud be a huge swing as i am told in the other table Texans are in 6@D |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: for the trump lead North shd have long @Hs .. so cross ruff must be safe|pg||
nt|thak: given that sumit and bhabesh are partners majority of the time, and all 4 part of same regular team. It is not surprising that auction was identical|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sandipdang:  yes - this one is all abt partnership understanding|pg||
nt|subhranp:  has to guess which way to play diamonds if a club shift comes now|pg||
nt|psyck: basically set up @d's & take trump fin, cannot lose control with the black suits under control|pg||
pc|c7|nt|prasun1966: Now it may make|pg||
nt|prasun1966: N is blocked|pg||
nt|r_tibre: sure it does... but not cold|pg||
pc|c5|nt|prasun1966: lost 2 imps here|pg||
nt|subhranp:  in the meantime railways pickup 6imps on B52 where the railways pair in the other room played in 1nt|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kista:  Texans had lots of missed oppurtunities here to recover thefull deficit|pg||
nt|r_tibre: on others even 12th trick may not come by :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sT|nt|prasun1966: But 12 tricks is in hand|pg||

nt|prasun1966: 7 more to IR or more?|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Now? @C or @D?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: did he really think N has only 2 @Ds?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: how can @D be wrong|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thak: slipped??|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 2@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: SORRY I MISSED SOME PLAY CONTRACT MADE MY FAULT|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and safety for the 8th trick|pg||
