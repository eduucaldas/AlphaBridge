nt|figo:  a game plus as some would say |pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  The same line up for Manyawar |pg||
nt|henryb:  I'll comment for a while if you would like|pg||

mb|3N|nt|vugraphzhz: GOOD MORNING ALL OF YOU|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henryb:  A tricky problem for E. I am sure we would all bid 3N, but 4@s is a much better contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||
nt|jain: missing akj pd bidding 4d,difficult to stop below game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  mminor part score tussle |pg||
nt|figo:  decl will be pleased |pg||
nt|jain: hmm friendly lead nd made|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  better than friendly - the only lead to allow the contract to make|pg||
nt|jain: fans of texan aces overjoyed for sure:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: TEST|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  I don't know how to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|figo:  how many wont lead  SA ? thats a Q worth asking |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: GOOD MORNING ALL|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Good Morning everybody|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 2@S here is 4-4 minor opening hand |pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|henryb:  Now a tricky problem for S.|pg||
nt|prasun1966: ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he might solve it. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Or rather, perhaps he should. He knows declarer has at least three spades, two clubs, and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|henryb:  as winners. So the only hope is that declarer has the stiff @hK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was counting tricks|pg||
nt|thak: hi|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|mackulky:  easy 9 tricks for Raju |pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|thak: @DA and a @S he needs to get it right|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|prasun1966: difficult for S to take @SA and Play @HA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  And if declarer has only the stiff @hK. he will have five diamonds, therefore ...|pg||
nt|thak: will need to guess anyway|pg||
nt|thak: with @D J not surviving|pg||
nt|thak: not knowing the 4-1 break, he's likely to play @CA , T to J planning to ruff @H 9 and a @S pitch on @D J|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: PLAY WAS DELAYED DUE TO APEAL|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  And partner, who did not preempt in first seat has to have a reason|pg||

pc|s6|pg||

nt|sandipdang:  with contract right sided 6nt shd roll home always|pg||
mb|3D|nt|r_tibre: gm all, thanks Pramod|pg||
mb|3H|nt|r_tibre: Rail off to a good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  EW can get ypto 4@S |pg||
nt|psyck: other room seems to be having some connection problems|pg||
mb|3S|nt|thak: this was strange, if laltu held @SA, he'd surely 've held onto winner @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: E and W r playing Strong @C  while NS r playing 2/1|pg||
nt|r_tibre: tough choice over 3@D.... no alternative seems really good|pg||
mb|4S|nt|thak: @S problem was resolved for suhas, and he still got it wrong..|pg||
mb|p|nt|thak: imaginative raise by arun|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe operator will let us know if 2@d showed just @s or something more|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  North is likely to play this in 2N or 3N after opening 2N in fourth seat|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s likely as @h raise|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  After two rounds of @d, he has 3@s, 1@h, 1@d and 1@c|pg||
nt|prasun1966: N will have to believe the @S10 to make this contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  He needs three more tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of these can come from the fourth spade, but he still needs two tricks from somewhere|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mackulky:  both play and defense will be interesting|pg||
nt|mackulky:  but I believe Declerer should prevail in the end|pg||
nt|figo:  E hand better than just a sign off |pg||
nt|psyck: anyway normal contract reached|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mackulky:  hi Pramod|pg||
nt|mackulky:  and all kibitzers|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: HI|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|thak: will they land in @Hs now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb:  the only place is hearts, which is possible if the @hK is onside|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Last hand also S led @HQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  but he needs two entries to dummy|pg||
nt|thak: powerful @D spots with NS|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jain: hi all|pg||
nt|r_tibre: def cant do much wrong from here|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|r_tibre: DSM got off to a good start yesterday, Rail came back with a better performance in the 2nd set... we have 4x14 today to decide the winner|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|thak: sdh still be -1, too many black suit losers|pg||
nt|thak: ..|pg||
nt|thak: that's quite a pause|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mackulky:  and @C hons placed favourably|pg||
nt|henryb:  And as Prasun said, that means he needs to take the @s finesse also|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|figo:  no D from N ...........|pg||
pc|c2|nt|r_tibre: for those not familiar with indian bridge teams, EW are regular members of DSM... |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jain: nice 3s from west left N with not much of a choice|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb:  which he did not|pg||
nt|thak: previous board was worth 13 to Railway as manas and subir played in 3N|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|prasun1966: Yes inserting the @S10 was the only way|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s7|pg||

pc|cA|pc|s9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the last hand|pg||
nt|nkgupt: still 8 tricks only unless bhabesh figures the implications of 5/0@c on @d|pg||

mb|p|nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: & south's double must have shown supp|pg||

mb|1D|nt|thak: I think they play dont here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: s might bid 1nt|pg||
mb|2D|nt|henryb:  6@d was by E, not S|pg||
nt|jain: hmm not sure if east shd act|pg||
nt|jain: 2c p 2d ppp?|pg||
nt|baldjean: 5@c is a good sacrifice here|pg||
nt|r_tibre: quite shapely first few deals this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think it is close between 5@d and 6@d as E over 4@h|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 6@d from E i suppose|pg||
nt|henryb:  Back up, operator|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 45 IMPS diff but not impossible in 14brds|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|figo:  is +140 correct score on last boards ?|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  4 @S shd be -1 on club lead and @D shift|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mackulky:  :)|pg||

nt|psyck: this time Inv+ in @c|pg||
nt|figo:  fine |pg||
nt|psyck: lot of work to be done|pg||
nt|psyck: inv+ = invitational hand or better|pg||
pc|h2|nt|r_tibre: S has to be careful on a @H lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|alok_daga: Laltu in deep thought I guess ,with 14hcp with him,all bidding.but seems they o\board|pg||
nt|thak: declarer has no entry to table, so will have to concede an open @C trick alongwith a @H, a@S and 2 @Ds|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mackulky:  well played N|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nkgupt: is a phantom anyway|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes indeed|pg||
nt|henryb:  but a trick is 5 imps in a close match|pg||
nt|nkgupt: texans fast loosing the ground|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mackulky:  with no count in Spades tough return for Ajay|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, just aaw for myself that 4@s is down|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mackulky:  third spade|pg||
nt|mackulky:  to kill the winner|pg||
nt|mackulky:  had Raju played a trump at trick 2 and Ajay retun Spade |pg||
pc|c4|nt|thak: defence will need to play @D after winning @S A|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mackulky:  it wud be -2 but no reaon to do it |pg||
nt|sandipdang:  5! also needs accurate defence|pg||
nt|r_tibre: though... declarer cant come to 9 even if @Hs blocked|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|prasun1966: To take the quick tricks against opps' slam is most common gesture of almost everybody:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Rajesh also did not find the heart play on Bd 57. He gave himself less chance, though, by grabbing the first spade|pg||
nt|nkgupt: this table i thought was much easier after the @c9 discard|pg||

nt|jain: another flat br|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  and Texan are in an early lead|pg||
nt|prasun1966: dbl can yield 500 for Texans|pg||

nt|prasun1966: 2@H? = weak i think|pg||

pc|c5|nt|mackulky:  4@H is not clearcut for EW |pg||

nt|r_tibre: agree alok.. i cudnt believe the pass over 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|figo:  arun might have been short in this and that as you said , but not courage |pg||
nt|r_tibre: a str @C opener.. first this set|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mackulky:  is it 2/4 or 2/6 pramod?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  4 sessions of 14 or 6 sessions of 14|pg||
nt|jain: pramodjee,r u ard |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good hand to respond 3@S showing a gf hand with 5-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|jain: a grand in @S|pg||
nt|pappoo: 3NT for NS is a make here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|prasun1966: deal no 5 gave Formidables 8 imps. Brave attempt by Venky there to pass 3@C dbl|pg||
nt|subhranp:  4s makes here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: and then North can see that hios points are gold and go on to small slam atleast|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nkgupt: retrf and settle in 3@s?|pg||

nt|jain: i m sure mrs nadar wont miss this grand|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jain: a decent slam ,not sure how come it was missed in the oher room|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2c might get West excited|pg||
nt|prasun1966: An unfriendly hand:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jain: 4h 4nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good hand for S to ask RKC too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: guess he must b hungry nd having lunch:)|pg||
nt|subhranp: 6nt can make from west hand here|pg||
nt|subhranp:  well, 4h is a bit of a desperate bid|pg||
nt|jaggys: once N cue bids 4 H and key cards are found 7 will be bid|pg||
nt|pappoo: not sure they will get there though!|pg||
nt|r_tibre: a conservative 1N by W on 34, allows NS to compete to winning @H, and another 7 imps for rail|pg||
nt|prasun1966: He will have to pass now  no way|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 3@H*|pg||
nt|prasun1966: :( another option ofcourse|pg||
nt|prasun1966: with 20|pg||
mb|4C|nt|nkgupt: looks like -1|pg||
nt|subhranp:  this looks like another bad board for Railways|pg||

nt|jain: operator?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: 6 SESS OF 14|pg||
nt|jain: pramodjee is around nd he wld let us know the format soon|pg||

nt|vugraphzhz: 4 SESSIONS TODAY AND 2 TOMORROW HALF DAY REST TOMORROW|pg||
nt|mackulky:  attacking @CQ wud give many headaches|pg||
nt|jain: so each team plays 84 brds against each other nd the top 2 qualify for the semifinals spot along with indian railways nd DSM,is that right pramodjee|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: DARE|pg||

pc|h9|nt|prasun1966: @S shift could have done well to get -1  now it makes|pg||
nt|pappoo: 3NT and 5 of either minor makes because of the DK being onside|pg||
nt|subhranp:  now makes 6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jain: shd b extras else why 4th suit nd 3nt,he cld have bid 3nt over over 2c also|pg||

pc|d3|pg||

nt|thak: any time finesse is going to be advantageous, ruff works equally well|pg||

pc|s3|nt|jain: nd shd suffer the same fate|pg||

nt|jain: usually rana is a very quick player|pg||
pc|s2|nt|prasun1966: Yes it is:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as per one kib state of the match sud stop them from bidding a 75% slam:)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|mackulky:  formidables sorry mistype|pg||
nt|mackulky:  well done |pg||
nt|alok_daga: so the lead is 18 unless someone gets tempted on brd no 42|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sga1: This board shud be 12 imps to Texans so equal and then 5 imps on the last board|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 4 @h sud hav a play i think|pg||
nt|psyck: Bhabesh in 6@s on deal 9 other room|pg||
nt|thak: can laltu make this and make up a little for going down in slam|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  manyavar close the gap on this bd|pg||
pc|s6|nt|prasun1966: good lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|arunbapat: 12 imps|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Yes|pg||
nt|arunbapat: so match will be tied 125/125|pg||
nt|prasun1966: A 'push' board hopefully|pg||
nt|pappoo: possible 2 imps to railways here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|psyck: yes play could go similar to other room with just @h finesse extra to make 4@h here|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|subhranp:  West in the other room prefering to treat the hand as weak 2 hand and stayed a level lower.|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Yes B42 is a very tempting hand  :)  somedays 7 can be bidded|pg||
pc|h2|nt|prasun1966: In the other Semi-Final  TexanAces is playing against Indian Railway|pg||
nt|prasun1966: -1 or '='  let us see|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any run from 1ntX as on the other tbl they wud be in 300 zone .....|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mackulky:  he decides to play for the split hon in @H|pg||
nt|subhranp:  not sure who is at fault but they got to go back and discuss this|pg||
nt|subhranp:  railways have gained 6imps on B24 to take the lead as the DSM pair in the other room played in 2H and went down|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|mackulky:  well this shud be a huge swing as i am told in the other table Texans are in 6@D |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: for the trump lead North shd have long @Hs .. so cross ruff must be safe|pg||
nt|thak: given that sumit and bhabesh are partners majority of the time, and all 4 part of same regular team. It is not surprising that auction was identical|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sandipdang:  yes - this one is all abt partnership understanding|pg||
nt|subhranp:  has to guess which way to play diamonds if a club shift comes now|pg||
nt|psyck: basically set up @d's & take trump fin, cannot lose control with the black suits under control|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Now it may make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|prasun1966: lost 2 imps here|pg||
nt|subhranp:  in the meantime railways pickup 6imps on B52 where the railways pair in the other room played in 1nt|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kista:  Texans had lots of missed oppurtunities here to recover thefull deficit|pg||
nt|r_tibre: on others even 12th trick may not come by :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|prasun1966: But 12 tricks is in hand|pg||
