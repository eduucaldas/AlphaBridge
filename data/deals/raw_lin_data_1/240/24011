pc|c3|nt|ady: yes true    4 heart tricks  wont need heart finesse  |pg||
nt|ady: club finesse rather|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panosk: tempting to finess @H to throw losing @C|pg||
nt|sverjohn: I am sure Holm hoped for a black suit from pd|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But this should also make thx to the Kx in clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|oliverc: right-sided, too|pg||

nt|vugraphzhc: missed the play, claimed 9|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3 down was too much thou|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sverjohn: It is quite a surprise that Drammen should have this kind of lead. Kristiansand clear favourites in this match|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam @s or @d?|pg||
nt|knutte: Looks like Heimdal, Bergen and Kristiansand will settle for the medals|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|panosk: W pass?|pg||
nt|panosk: thats is true so usually is the hand with most points if no stopper issues involved|pg||
nt|panosk: past results and standings here  http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the lower the better, werid distribution. |pg||

mb|1S|nt|ybob: 9 tricks on @S |pg||
nt|bobholl: both "supporters" have minmal values|pg||

nt|ady: e/w   need to play 3NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good valuation by W. usually Qx us a good holding for NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|osvaill83: slam can be made on a nice layout :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@S should make.|pg||
nt|osvaill83: 6nt as well|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ralfwil: in 6@d declarer can go wrong, but not in 6@s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: @D layout dicey:)|pg||
nt|knutte: Best lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: Rusinov lead promising the K|pg||
nt|knutte: Also takes away A of @H from the table|pg||

mb|p|nt|panosk: nice 1NT from S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: Played by N-yes.|pg||
nt|panosk: cant see how to avoid game here |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: in this event, every bridgeclub can start with as many team as they are able to get toghether, then it is knockout rounds untill 7 teams is remaining, then then 7 teams remaining ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: plus the host of the event will get a place in the final. Where every team play eachother, very popular event to join for every player|pg||

mb|p|nt|andersk: Hi|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ady: needs J@C  to come down in 3|pg||
nt|sverjohn: A bit surprised that Holm did not put pressure on opponents with a 3@d bid|pg||

nt|mamos:  is this a two suiter?|pg||
nt|knutte: 4 @S makable NS|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing the 2nd @d was a mistake|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: on a @h lead that is|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: better X or 1NT ?|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: i like X with 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|grebrof: some text went missing :)|pg||
nt|panosk: lets see how gd they are with finding Queens now :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|panosk: lead is very reasonable if you cant see all cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: 3 hearts surely bid by west as a transfer bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S+2@H+3@D+2@C=9 and @S hook can provide the 10th trick.|pg||
nt|murat e: or a single and choose contract bid we dont know|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: i would double too but 3 nt won't make i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: with doubleton @D better|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C the best spot to E-W|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ugly - slam decent but the red suits do them in|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow  game is certainly close|pg||
nt|panosk: a more observant fellow spec suggested that if S plays low spade in 2nd trick E will not make|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if south did not open 3 nt from west is good on a heart lead but that is gone|pg||
nt|knutte: Just as my tricks sometimes does :)|pg||
nt|knutte: Good bidding by NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: sory it was as it is here|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: what to lead? @s of @H?|pg||
nt|panosk: thats also true, spade lead gives him more chances to make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @s lead gives the oportunity to make 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Will make now as A of @H in front|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 9@H shud be in dummy :) |pg||
pc|h5|nt|ybob: now @D lead defeat it|pg||
nt|ybob: not hard i think ...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: there is 3 definatge losers in spade and spade ruff   and a trump trick  and will have to cope with the bad diamond split|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oliverc: Burns Law violation in progress :)|pg||
nt|panosk: must duck|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: South will think this well trough, got a very "compy" lead|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|panosk: today's schedule has only 1 and a half match in line, so just 48 boards to be played|pg||
nt|panosk: piece of cake compared to 80 boards played yesterday|pg||
pc|hT|nt|knutte: Not much points but nice layout|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: now club switch    but may still make on an end play|pg||
pc|h6|nt|murat e: 2 dia maybe showed both majors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: To think of yes plausible.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|panosk: even that wudnt be enough |pg||
nt|mamos:  i think looking at the nS hands youd want to b e in 4@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @h lead isn´t my lead as W. @cQ or @cJ depending on leads. Why? the shorter suit has more odds for the defence|pg||
pc|h9|nt|murat e: this hand shows how important to open the bidding when the suit is good without jack of clubs it is 11 hcp must still open at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: now should be down|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ekrens, popular in Norway though Ekren does no longer play it|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all!|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Welcome to Goran Sperber|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzhc: Nice try by PIL|pg||
pc|d8|nt|panosk: maybe double dummy can make, 2 rounds of trumps, pull 3@H to throw loser in @C and thrn A@D and @D to 10|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panosk: @H lead asks less points from pard, @S asks less and it doesnt give away a trick,  dont know, spade i think for me|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos:  and as the cards lie @cQ would have beaten 4@s|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! but also the natural lead for me|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: also the more solid....|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: cannot make now|pg||
nt|ady: I cannot see any winning line|pg||
nt|ady: can make now     west should have returned 3rd trump|pg||

nt|panosk: minor technical problem will not spoil our fun|pg||
nt|ybob: i go out on next hand, i leave you on good hands with Bob and Murat|pg||

nt|panosk: wasnt possible to make anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: http://www.namsosbk.org/Lag-NM-i-Namsos-25-28-mai|pg||
nt|panosk: nice hands |pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: similar trump suit|pg||
nt|ady: was a case for playing ace of spades first round    but as it went needed to play K@C   first round  draw trump and exit with a club    either defender is end played|pg||
nt|ady: part score in sspades for e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree?|pg||
nt|panosk: anyway another gd result for Tromps|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 1st segment was very exciting, this will be too|pg||
nt|murat e: yes but previous board maybe bidding was different at the table....|pg||
nt|panosk: i think W have doubled 2@H |pg||
nt|ybob: thx all :)|pg||
nt|panosk: open to suggestions for East's bid :)|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|rnmalik: hi & wlc.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Apart from that I understand that bidding is fairly standard on both sides|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT on 19 is expert practice, usually described as upgrading to 20|pg||
nt|murat e: here north has too much property on spades which does not suit south if he was thinking about a dia slam|pg||
nt|murat e: ty bye|pg||
nt|ybob: bye|pg||
nt|panosk: 21C majors obviously|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if partner bidding volunterely at five level vulnerable how did west pass|pg||
nt|panosk: *2@C|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobholl: poor north difficult choice|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes i do agree  you cannot expect to make many @h tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The best use of the green card.|pg||
mb|p|nt|knutte: 9 tricks in @S EW at the most, NS might make 4 @D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gsper:  Sensible. Few pairs have good methods for minor slams after 2NT opening.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have a fortunate 4 hearts    but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 spades|pg||
nt|knutte: For res: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  this is solid|pg||
nt|panosk: thats declares 9th trick|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@c is GF|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT is lebensohl and than he guessed well|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades down if clubs attacked early before diamond set up|pg||
nt|panosk: *declarer's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: add the 9 of hearts to E/W  then 4 spades around 75 percent|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not like many Norwegian pairs playing 2@c as either GF or just a nice suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: normally after 2 nt 3 sp is transfer to 3 nt after which responder bids his minor to show slam interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|oliverc: Anyone else for "Pass" with the West hand?|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S make but impossible to find, i'd personally venture a 3@C bid in case pard has 6-4 with cubs second suit|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2/1 gf unless 2/1 suit rebid in next round of bidding, then it showed only a good suit|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: E/W here play it as GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Res: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|ady: north has taken the push     hard to judge    should be down 1|pg||
nt|ady: especially on diamond lead|pg||
nt|panosk: with spades behaving this will make|pg||
nt|baldjean: hello all|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hello|pg||
nt|panosk: hello Jeanine|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panosk: not me Oliver sorry , not of that disposition in life :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|oliverc: Must be the Aegean sun :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: defending 4 spades  may not be clear  how to defend after cashing A@H unless south casn give a suit preference signal|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sverjohn: Looks like 9 tricks could be the limit here. Actually not unreasonable to get to game|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4@c probably weakish, 3NT would be serious slam try|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gsper:  Is that standard in Norway, KÃ¥re?|pg||
nt|murat e: but south instead of taking an adventure made a sensible bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can make 6 on any lead, same play. Am I right?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Seems so to me too.|pg||
nt|andersk: hi|pg||
nt|ady: also a good chance of 10 tricks if the K@C was woth north    may be able to play a club towards the queen  and create a discard of a heart later|pg||
nt|knutte: Bergen gained 11 imp at board 17 |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Live update every 4th board from all the other matches|pg||
nt|baldjean: 11 tricks always|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if they use Serious 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|grebrof: I like 4@s - many times it makes|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|STRIK3R: yes, cards lay good for E/W|pg||
nt|panosk: W knows that E has only 2 cards in spades otherwise he wud have bid 2@S after 2@C not 2@H |pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobholl: underlead indicated but doesn't help|pg||
nt|knutte: The clue was to find the A of @C|pg||
nt|panosk: usually its honor doubleton|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|panosk: avoidance in @S to be safe with @C return|pg||
nt|panosk: its all over the world nowadays, spreading like a contagion|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panosk: i very much like 3NT by S, bold but you have to be in this time cause you cant actually check if pard has stoppers in both majors |pg||
pc|h2|nt|STRIK3R: found the best place to play|pg||
pc|h6|nt|STRIK3R: the 2@s opening was 5/6 - 10/11 in this vul, promising 5@s and normaly a 4+ minor suit, but could be only 3 card minor on the side|pg||
nt|knutte: also put opps under pressure|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: guess a1D small @D|pg||
nt|ady: east thinking spade trick likely to make   not knowing opening a 7 card suit|pg||
pc|dT|nt|panosk: 3@S bid in fact asks W to choose best game 3NT or 4@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Børre sees that he might go down with @S and @D 4-2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: after the @d switch, no warning bells?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sverjohn: Got his tenth there. South had to switch to a diamond trick 2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|knutte: understandable 5 @C from Eide|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|panosk: avoidance meanning give hand to E|pg||

pc|s8|nt|oliverc: well "the proof is in the pudding" here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sverjohn: to set up the club trick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: not eenough entries to cross to north hand and take club finesse and return for long club|pg||
nt|knutte: K of @D and one down|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: clubs did not brak any way|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|panosk: so he cant attack clubs |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Sometimes J of @D is a happy face to see :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|STRIK3R: so the 2@s opening will not be copied in open room, his choices is either a "hard" 1@s or a "fake" 2@d(multi)|pg||

nt|panosk: i played in a club last night and boards seemed so boring, how do they manage to make these here so much more interesting?|pg||

nt|panosk: he played it the best way he cud i think |pg||

mb|1D|nt|panosk: thx O R|pg||
nt|andersk: 4 @C was alerted as short, but I beleve it was asking partner to transfeer to he's major|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@c for E?|pg||
nt|panosk: defence was excellent in last |pg||
nt|knutte: 4 @S a good save|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@d Multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: this time 8-5 for a change|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if he intend to open in first hand that is|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|knutte: not easy for Eide now|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5@d?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: they open 2M with 8-11|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H inevitable either way|pg||
mb|2H!|an|5/4|nt|ady: slam time    6 spades for n/s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes 4@c looks fair|pg||
nt|mamos:  specsakke agrees :)|pg||
nt|panosk: N was thinking 1NT or 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|knutte: Must close his eyes and make a 3NT bid :)|pg||
nt|panosk: both ok in this hand, i slightly favor 1NT too|pg||
mb|2S|nt|knutte: or keep them open and pass|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@D now? |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2NT asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Preempting with a 5-card major on the side is very unclassical, but what do you do?|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the 1972 Olympics, a Canadian opened 4@H with 6-6 in the majors. The opps...|pg||
nt|gsper:  bid 4@S, he doubled and it made|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@c one long suit|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to 3NT    but may have a difficult ride|pg||
nt|mamos:  its poss that 4@c is Texas|pg||
nt|panosk: trumps break well for decl |pg||
nt|knutte: N must switch to small @S after A of @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: opted for part score|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Caution may pay off here. Guess Frank did not like his club holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: looks like 9 tricks for NS in @H and 8 EW in sp|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C= i have long unspecified suit, 2@D say which|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@c show max hand, either @H or @s, 3@d ask what suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: need to ruff 2 hearts to make |pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: and on @C lead no entries to do that|pg||
nt|ady: or possibly ruff 1 heart and set up long club|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@s show @H|pg||
nt|panosk: ok he might have 25-27 also right? :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andersk: Peronally I overcall 1 @S with Nybo's hand|pg||
nt|ady: low spase now best|pg||
nt|andersk: what line?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: he could yes|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gsper:  In general, if you have 5 trumps it is a good idea to lead one. I am not sure how it would have worked here.|pg||
nt|murat e: i think heart lead and dia shift needed to beat this contract|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree |pg||
nt|murat e: helgamos hand is rubbish and he has a passed parnner but hands fit very well|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnmalik: W must be feeling low on missing 4@S by that preempt and the defence cashed their tricks to the max.|pg||
nt|grebrof: interesting choice of switch|pg||
nt|knutte: Didnt see that one coming|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andersk: after 3. hand openings and not vouln, m|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: infact he could have 25-28|pg||
nt|panosk: happened twicw so far :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3@c max hand? with what N holds?|pg||
nt|panosk: *twice|pg||
pc|hT|nt|STRIK3R: West was in perfect spot for using "snapdragon", but they dont have that in their cc, dbl(snapdragon) would have showed 5@s and minimum Tx in @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: makes now|pg||
nt|baldjean: is it not rather min?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 6hcp is max of weak 2|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 6-7|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: they open 2@H with 8-11|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, ok|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: club lead is awkard    east has 3 spades to the 10 and doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: North thinking...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards - easy.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panosk: in board 2 4@S were made hence 12 imps to Drammen|pg||
nt|andersk: needed to switch @D to couse any problems|pg||
nt|panosk: not an easy contract|pg||
nt|grebrof: or|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panosk: its a hopeless contract |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: thats why I wondered if he would made an upgrade at once, opening 2@h|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: even on this lead  awkward to make 12 tricks on the lay|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andersk: Probably down on @D switch|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@d would have shown a minimum hand with @h and 3@h would have shown a minimum hand with @s, after 2NT that is|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: always getting the contract on the strong hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|wygbe1: i wonder why n didnt act sooner|pg||
nt|mamos:  no reason to choose anything other than this straightforward line is there?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but lucky to find E with the stiff @s....|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: dont think can get back and forth without east getting a trump promotion|pg||
nt|knutte: Yes, makes now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: good way to treat multi responses|pg||
pc|dK|nt|knutte: because of @H 3-3 :)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|vugraphzhc: good guess|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S play what we could call UDA, upside down attitude, compared to STANDARD, Standard is HI-LO to show even number of cards, but hight card encouring, UDA would be HI-LO to show ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: even number of cards, but low card as encouringing|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Bakke thinking|pg||

nt|panosk: another hard 1 for decl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: your guess correct :)|pg||
nt|panosk: i think its very reasonable bidding |pg||
nt|panosk: this will be ducked|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: im ok with pass in 2nd no 4-4 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  I wonder if 2NT was natural (unusual these days) or minors or something|pg||
nt|panosk: the rest two suits more likely|pg||
nt|murat e: red against white east did not fancy a negative double here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hi David I will join you for the rest of this set|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Ronny    welcome|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 8 tricks for S - at least....|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: that was a surprise....|pg||
nt|andersk: probably 8 tricks, even 9 on a good day|pg||
pc|h9|nt|panosk: i think trump now by W, or 10@H|pg||
nt|panosk: trump doesnt look appealing to W as he may reveal trump lay out, @D and @C are out of the question i think|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: could easely get 13 tricks here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panosk: @C from dummy and if no @D return he will make|pg||
pc|hK|nt|STRIK3R: no, sorry|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @s suit dosent behave|pg||
nt|panosk: very likely i think too|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: in a hopless 6 diamonds here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Dag did his work bidding 3@s on this one, making it hard for East/West to make a controlled auction|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panosk: E doing his bit with highest @C available|pg||
nt|panosk: not a clear sign though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what switch @S or @D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: high @c = spade ?|pg||
nt|panosk: most likely |pg||
nt|panosk: depends on their agreements|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, weired 1nt|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: should be the first swing this set for Tromse|pg||
nt|panosk: no he found the A|pg||
pc|c7|nt|STRIK3R: Sitting in east seat, x of 1@h would normaly promise @d as well as @s, holding T72 in @d you dont want your partner to start bidding @d's, beside you know North has some @s's. ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Think pass of 2@c is ok in Teams|pg||
nt|baldjean: 7 without @d lead|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: well, can always ruff some small @s's before running @H|pg||
nt|panosk: indeed|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panosk: in board 18 as was accurately suggested by operator Astrid earlier EW cud make 3NT which they did |pg||
nt|panosk: in open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo should have played the 2@C.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|STRIK3R: but as the hands are, N/S would have stopped bidding on either bid from west|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andersk: EW might block the @H's and W might be endplayed for 9|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: true   if you bang out top cards you can make 6 hearts 3 diamonds 2 clubs and 1 spade|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hi all|pg||
nt|panosk: also 9@C becomes a trick if needed be|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|panosk: maybe still cant blame W at all very hard to find |pg||
pc|c9|nt|andersk: 8 most likely|pg||
nt|mamos:  West's double turns out  to be poorly timed here - i think it was too aggressive |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: you said there was no lead that would give this away, there is no declaring either who will get this right :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panosk: * our excellent operator Astrid |pg||
nt|panosk: trump now is imperative|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|baldjean: he only needs to ruff 1@s|pg||

nt|baldjean: not even one, right. Q@d |pg||

nt|ady: a more secure 6@D this time  for n/s|pg||
nt|panosk: as you can see from this board banging Aces on the lead never a gd choice, even stiff ones, let decl find them him/herself|pg||
nt|ady: hi Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S will reach 3NT and will most likely win it, just loosing 2@s and 2@d's|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree. |pg||
nt|panosk: you mean in the bidding?|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry private |pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: nice @d slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Interestingly, on board 1, 4@S was made against that awful trump break in the other room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|STRIK3R: 3@s?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: from east|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S   too expensive|pg||
mb|2H|nt|STRIK3R: a coffee break board :)|pg||
nt|panosk: Hansen has got to play all hopeless contracts so far, i bet he wished he sat North by now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Stokkvik was not pleased when his pd lost th2nd down by discarding @H 9 in stead of @D9|pg||
nt|knutte: 6 @D will have more than 50% chance as some specs suggested|pg||
nt|panosk: nice grand|pg||
nt|panosk: Heimdal missed 4@S in 2|pg||
mb|4D|nt|murat e: to make 3 nt west needs help in heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: no "muiderberg" (5@S and 4+ minor 6-10) nice weapont to have|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: E/W was never afraid of bidding|pg||
nt|panosk: impressive they imediately started next board , no comments about previous board, exemplary attitude|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D now.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: dont thin anything will stop north here|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: west on lead must not cash either one of his aces to beat this slam very tricky hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: I was about to say 4@s must look tempting, but hopefully it dosent promise void|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: from North|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: backside of opening 1@H with either 5@h or 4-4 in Majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: or not to be touched at all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: @H is 4-4 so no problems for declearer here|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H shud be relay 3@H transfer i think, correct me if im wrong|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2NT showing 25-27|pg||
nt|panosk: yes i remember that from yesterday quite rare |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@h just relay, and 3@h is transfer, correct :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@h as realy is pretty common in Norway|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: relay...|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Stokkvik is thinking..|pg||
nt|panosk: another bid i like from Anderssen, 1@H in 3rd position|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panosk: NT not a safe place for NS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|STRIK3R: East wouldent like to see that @d holding in dummy after he lead A of @d|pg||
nt|panosk: S will pass|pg||
nt|panosk: whud ask for Aces i think|pg||
nt|panosk: *shud|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: 4@S nice save|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: dont think south will get exited  even with a void spade opposite|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not this time :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  nine on top|pg||
nt|larsarthur: auauau|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panosk: gd thing for decl W can get to play only on the lead, the rest is pretty tough|pg||
nt|knutte: 3 @H will make, but u wouldnt like to be any higher|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gsper:  That pass by S was disciplined, to say the least|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: A of @s continuation looks normal|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Yes a spade lead would have worried north more|pg||
nt|ady: re all    had connection problems|pg||
nt|panosk: dont know what the meanning of 4@C is in their system but maybe easilly misunderstood as 2nd suit if not clear agreement |pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: lose one in each suit.|pg||
nt|panosk: so i vote for Aces but open to other suggestions|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Oliver|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|murat e: actually heart slam is good|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: indeed would have been nice|pg||
nt|panosk: N has to play for Ax @D on side to make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|murat e: dummys club can be discarded on long spade|pg||
nt|panosk: that is also true|pg||
nt|panosk: gd guess to ruff high|pg||
nt|knutte: well, why listen to me :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|STRIK3R: Still have :)|pg||
nt|knutte: opps just keep pushing spades|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|panosk: but which is the right side ? :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Play @D from the dummy to make.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|oliverc: 6@S from an aceless hand maybe a little risky (perhaps 4@C), but it got them there|pg||
pc|c8|nt|STRIK3R: but not sure you would choose to save in this vul|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: everybody who knows Frank, know that he uses strict rules, so his 1NT opening is most likely solid, and he rearly overbid hsi hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|murat e: yes help from partner or help from opps both exist here for his luck|pg||
nt|panosk: heats and heart and heart will be the winning play here|pg||
nt|panosk: thats what i meant after 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|h9|nt|knutte: might switch to K of @C?|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like it makes|pg||
nt|baldjean: all systems have downsides. there is no perfect system. which is what makes bridge so interesting|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panosk: anyway right contract is found eventually|pg||
pc|hT|nt|panosk: even if not in system and 1@H is 5card beter open 1@H with this than a poor 1@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: true Jeanine|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Live update: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: I would prefer 1@c opening, maybe it is just me :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: ups, 3NT went 2 down|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: where they made 12 here|pg||
nt|panosk: heart lead in 3 and no guess in @D +11 imps to Tromps|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: with that result, Heimdal finding them in third spot right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Which means there still is a race for all the medals :)|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: was not many choices on the play there|pg||
nt|panosk: it wasnt easy from the start|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: South had all the right points, AK, AK, AK and A, the perfect count for 25 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: He played it well|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: he did :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|murat e: declarers usually have a void or single at this type of auction so the lead was not absurd|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Nybo didnt even care to try get an overtrick, and thats how you play when you play teamscooring:)|pg||
nt|ady: another slam    this time 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes, even on a @s lead, since the @c breaks 3-2 and you have the @d's|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D weak 2 in unknown major i guess|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: what will happen in east now?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|STRIK3R: constructive 2@h openings|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly good suit :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: south might be tempted to go for a game in NT|pg||
nt|ady: I thin slightly better choice last hand Ronny    could have played 3 round sof hearts after drawing trumps  just in case east was 3 - 4 -2-4  in which case would be later squeezed|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: ref board 21 when he dident bid game after invitaton from south|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board4= In the OR no preempt and landed in 5@C rather than 4@S.|pg||
nt|panosk: back to "normal" crazy distributions |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: could have AK AKQJ KQJ QJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: that is true|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andersk: Helgemo is not scared to overcall|pg||
nt|panosk: or to wrong game|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: They play 2@H/@S as 8-11 6+, so 2@D is about 3-7|pg||
nt|panosk: thx Kristian|pg||
nt|panosk: still 4@S also make |pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: I was thinking more after the first round of @c, since west showed up with a small one, you couldent really defend against J97x in east hand, but as you say, you would having that ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: squeeze going|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@s preemtive I guess|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4 hearts    but 4 spades a good save for n/s|pg||
nt|mamos:  may well be 3NT again|pg||
nt|panosk: and plent of entries in his hand to establish a suit for an extra trick shud that was needed|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would pass|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|STRIK3R: 3@c asking for strengt and suit quality|pg||
nt|bobholl: playing multi we would bid 2@D 2nt and than 3 nt show akq 6th :) in any coulour|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3NT= max suit and max strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: might stop now|pg||
nt|panosk: me too, but if i had the 10@H i wud bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobholl: best manche|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  dont wait too long to get to 6 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 2NT from south would have been forcing asking for singleton/void|pg||
nt|panosk: i like the one with 2 bare kings :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: I bid to much, so I wouldent I guess :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mamos:  too much to do here T FIRST GLANCE|pg||
nt|oliverc: maybe not :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@c was a good choice|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: when first bidding that is|pg||
nt|baldjean: well, 3@c has its merits. if west does not have 5@c he is prone to have @h support|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: this will make |pg||
nt|oliverc: easy 3NT here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|STRIK3R: south did well to let 3NT stand|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@S now i guess|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: this will be over in a minute|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|oliverc: good stop :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: @S Q i guess now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no success I think, but with open cards.....|pg||
mb|4S|nt|STRIK3R: unless going for the @c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: shud have taken from hand to play spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: hand 21  played in game here provided a swing for Tromse as I tht would slam went down in OR|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|murat e: can north deblock his queen of spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad guesser as usual (ask my P)|pg||
nt|panosk: 5@D also make i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|STRIK3R: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 7@D as compared to the declares 6.|pg||
nt|panosk: they may end up playing in 4-3 instead of 6-2 thats the downside|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: South hand short of entries, but can 3@s be made?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer has entry problems from one hand to the other|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: wont distroy his income to dummy before setting up the winning @d's, all he need is to develop 1 trick beside his 6 clear winners|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards, now @dJ and if it holds, a @c to @cQ and a @s finess....|pg||
nt|panosk: decl worried about 4-2 trump break and considers his options |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Tromsø gained 8 imps in brd 21|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andersk: I like Flott's line here, playing @C first|pg||
nt|panosk: can pls someone ship the board dealing software to Greek Federation :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|STRIK3R: will cash out now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|STRIK3R: for 9 total tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andersk: He will duck|pg||
nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: I think I would prefeer a duck|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo might hav a stiff @S K or KJ stiffed, as he had|pg||
nt|baldjean: he should take in hand then; it gives him more options|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d2|nt|STRIK3R: ups, bad guess :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 10@D to avoid blocking @D|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andersk: That would force him to play another suit|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|baldjean: unlikely with S bidding 2@s|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d7|nt|knutte: so down with this contract, possible imps for EW as @H-contract makes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|panosk: i mean these hands are tough but so much more interesting |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|panosk: why spade shift from N and not heart?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think declarer will manage to steal a @D trick too eventually|pg||
nt|oliverc: Yes. South will come to 2 Diamonds and the A@C, but that's all|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: brb|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panosk: and testing |pg||
nt|panosk: was thinking an end play in @D |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|baldjean: would be  safe to rujn 1 more round ofo trump|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sverjohn: Yes, spade or diamond would have killed it|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|baldjean: as long as communication betweeen hand and dummy is still there|pg||
nt|panosk: i think E whud have ducked 1 round of @D, but thought @C return was single|pg||
nt|panosk: *shud|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: short break|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have ducked @d too|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Marstarander opened 1@C on brd 21 in OR, while Solli Hansen opened 1@D here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: I like his 3rd hand oopening 1@C - |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: He wants pd to lead @C and not @D if opps get to play the contract.|pg||
nt|panosk: if its not strong @C i cant see the benefit in general, apart from this board|pg||
nt|panosk: with an 18 holding you hope to play, not to defend|pg||
nt|panosk: 41 imps exchanging hands in 1st six boards, translating to an imp gain for Kristiansands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so +1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|STRIK3R: because he know that east has 0-2 @s's, so the @s suit is most likely blocked|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pc|cT|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: 4@s e/w and 5@h n/s on this hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: agree, safe to play @c|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 14 IMP lead we have 7 more boards here, but 10 more comparisons|pg||
nt|panosk: thats what a finess is about, 50-50 so cant always win|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: true, I dident see that|pg||
nt|andersk: quite some hands this set|pg||
nt|baldjean: so if you decide to bid on ith E I think 3@c is right. the question is: should y<ou really bid on?|pg||

mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 2@H = 5-9 hcp, 5@h and 4 in a minor|pg||

mb|3D|nt|STRIK3R: according to their cc|pg||

nt|ady: 5@C  3 losers|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: what do you prefer? 5@d or 4@H?... ehm 4@h out of the question now|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C is very choice i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: E/W open lowest 4 card suit, can open 1@c with 4333 if the @s suit is poor|pg||
nt|panosk: i wud prefer 3@C unless they play it non forcing|pg||

nt|panosk: natural lead since no stayman by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: easy 8 tricks with diamonds breaking|pg||

nt|panosk: Garozzo said you must always lead your singleton, in a more elaborate way though :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If you dont lead you dont have one:)|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@H might score better here. Declarer will surely get the Diamonds right|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Stokkvik does not like dummy very much :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s should make, even if Q@s is not guessed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thats the problem pre-empting with 6 card suits   hard to evaluate with a good hand opposite that|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: or if south ducked the @h lead|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: nothing seems easy here, except the @s layout|pg||
nt|sverjohn: As we thought a swing to Kristiansand on board 19. 4h was beaten|pg||

nt|bobholl: 4@S difficult now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so N/S missed out a good sac in @d or @h, the 1@h opening probably scared North |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: and only 9 tricks in @s as well, I will not make analyzes anymore, sorry... :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: could have been down on @H ruff but S expects no @D A in N|pg||
nt|panosk: sspade and wishfull thinking|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: playing one round of @c and two times @H, would later endplay east in @d|pg||
nt|panosk: tend to like @DA as lead|pg||
nt|baldjean: agreed. from AK I would almost always lead the A|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Very tight now  at the top|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panosk: the argument here is that E opened @D and then showed very strong hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Bergen 120|pg||

nt|vugraphzhc: Kristiansand 108|pg||

pc|hA|nt|panosk: against the @d lead that is|pg||
nt|panosk: its the 3 and 2 in @C to start with |pg||

nt|vugraphzhc: Studentene 103|pg||

nt|panosk: and 4@H dont seem to make|pg||
nt|oliverc: no. I think 9 tricks the absolute limit for EW in hearts|pg||
nt|panosk: due to lack of entries mainly|pg||
nt|oliverc: and even that might depend on some help from Opps|pg||

mb|3N|nt|murat e: wrong...|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@D not bad EW, however it cant make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you play weak 2 as their cc states, that is not a 2@s opening|pg||
nt|panosk: you can tell me in private also :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Christer is thinking, %&&/%¤&(=(&/)/&/) :)|pg||
nt|murat e: spade discard|pg||

nt|ady: firstr quiet hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: shall we predict just making? 2@c that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: though last hand could have been defeated  south might have considered saving in 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: an another 13 imp to Tromsø, 1 IMP now|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would have opened 1 spade. But this could have worked out well|pg||
nt|knutte: Good contract thou :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S can make DD|pg||
nt|oliverc: this should be ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 4@C by S is new suit or cue bid in spades?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: should have been born in switzerland :)|pg||
nt|panosk: they dont have much oil there :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: 4 @S all about locating J of @H|pg||

pc|c2|nt|baldjean: if you asked my wife that question, she would answer "Schalke 04" and talk about football :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|STRIK3R: not checback, xyNT 2@c forces 2@d|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But a weak 2 opener should never bid again, so this could have waked up Holm|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: that was expected Ronny    6@D  - 1  with ace and king of clubs to loose|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hehe|pg||
pc|c5|nt|murat e: south accepts game-try and bids 3 nt with 4-3-3-3 flat distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT is usually some kind of relay nowadays|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so we guess east forgot system, or was not sure if the system was on after an intial pass in opening from west(ref board 4 in open room)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 6-5 is obvious|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gsper:  But you are right that natural fits this bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: north thinks 4 hearts is better in fact both contracts make|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would not like to pass, to be honest. the @s of partner can't be too good|pg||
nt|panosk: what does 5@S mean? |pg||
nt|panosk: cant be asking for spade honors to go to slam|pg||
nt|oliverc: maybe not. needs to get the Clubs right here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: More imps to Tromsø, as Heimdal only bid 6@s on board 7|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: smartly played @c|pg||

pc|h8|nt|bobholl: guess 1 down now but on @S lead at least -2|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: indeed, even that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: not a 50% slam, @SQ and @CK had to behave|pg||

nt|panosk: trumps 3-2 is a rare treat in this set :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzhc: short break|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|panosk: 11 imps to Kristiansands after 6@D -1 in 24|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, I was not speaking in general terms. he was correct for this board; at other boards going to 3-level might have been better|pg||
nt|panosk: ok i have responce to that think hard on the lead and then play all cards fast|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Laughing about Rune claiming away a trick :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gsper:  On board 7 the other room missed the slam in much the same way|pg||
nt|panosk: its not fair this early in the morning |pg||
nt|panosk: E will pass reluctantly i think|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: no fit N/S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: nice 4 spades for n/s|pg||
nt|knutte: 41-7 to Bergen so far this round|pg||
mb|2S|nt|STRIK3R: yes, but should be possible to reach for E/W in open to|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: notrumps from west is an interesting contract|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Rune smiling too I guess :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Yes :)|pg||
nt|panosk: he shud try a 3@C bid now i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: good bidding from e/w again|pg||

pc|d2|nt|bobholl: you have to discuss what redouble now is (retransfer ?)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: looks like it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and old rule - give opps as much rope as they need and they will hang themselves:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|STRIK3R: Tromsø in the lead|pg||
nt|ady: will need to get 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: see 7 safe tricks|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: getting 4 diamonds give you 8|pg||
nt|ady: even that not enough with Q@H wrong|pg||
nt|knutte: shd make easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: unlucky :)|pg||
nt|panosk: any news from the Bergens-Lillehammer match?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panosk: i know what you meant Jeanine was just joking|pg||
nt|baldjean: the difficulty is to decide what is right, and that's part of what makes bridge so interesting|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobholl: @c with @H ttolerance|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: E/W surely bid a lot, 3@c here is not my style, if x of 2@h show @h|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks in 3NT , but looking for the 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: ....or 3 @D :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: but east didn't understand|pg||
nt|ady: north not moving after taking early action|pg||
nt|ady: is minimum   but very suitable|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to play @h to 9|pg||
nt|mamos:  this looks a normal contract and should make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gsper:  Many Scandinavians would have bid 3@C (minimum) as W. This is something different.|pg||
nt|panosk: was double an option for N?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Lillehammer leading with 28 IMPs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|murat e: even on a club lead declarer can duck twice and if he knows the rest can make it|pg||
nt|ady: minimum 1 down|pg||
nt|panosk: had some comments suggesting 3@S is beter , i agree|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|panosk: and @D back, pard has his reasons |pg||
nt|panosk: another way to look at it W has nothing beter to play|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: south have opend a weak hand, 3NT was not really an option|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not after 3@c|pg||
nt|panosk: and everybody bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Plays the ball over to Rune I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: With a max hand Rune would bid 3 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Then 3 NT from Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Tromsø now 1 VP behind Heimdal|pg||
pc|h8|nt|panosk: or double which maybe converted to penalty in absence of a gd game from S|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|baldjean: I think getting rid of an @h loser first would be better here|pg||
nt|panosk: thats very right |pg||

nt|kemperg: @H5??|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: mm|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Robert Althe|pg||
nt|kemperg: not a clear count signal, perhaps trying a @D signal?|pg||
nt|panosk: didnt agree with me :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gsper:  3@S maybe minimum wothout singleton|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: good save against 4@s :)|pg||
nt|panosk: its getting more and more interesting |pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: J@H    backward finesse   and get diamond right    unlikely|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: where leading|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andersk: and @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|andersk: Per Arne Flott will probably not misplay this one|pg||

nt|kemperg: @SA and @S and@S is best|pg||
pc|sT|nt|STRIK3R: still in the lead, but not with so many imps|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|panosk: the lead gives decl a @C trick and makes his life easier, still even without @C lead he wud have to ruff 2@H in hand and ends up the same with @H 4-2|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kemperg: big problems for leader|pg||

nt|panosk: S overcall limits EW chances to 4 spades|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: North coldent bid again on that hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|murat e: again a -4 of a major- contract and friendly distributions |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: and Bergen just bought 5@c undobled on the same deal Jim bid 5@d alone|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos:  sorry |pg||

nt|oliverc:  8 top tricks, but little chance of a 9th.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|bobholl: north won't like the sigth of the 4333 dummy|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: showing 4@s and 5@H, minimum GF values|pg||

pc|d2|nt|murat e: if declare guesses wrong both diamond and trumps can go down of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass by W?? no support dbl, but 19 pts|pg||
nt|panosk: with @D breaking well decl has only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|murat e: when in with the ace of spades east will play a diamond|pg||
nt|mamos:  not an opener for me|pg||
nt|panosk: if he knew OR result he wud have claimed -1 right now :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: can make this on the lay   but I have my doubts    needs to play clubs twice   and gain entry on thir round   and finesse 10@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: as spec expected, 3NT or dbl|pg||
nt|panosk: *depending|pg||
pc|sT|nt|STRIK3R: hard to make this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but defence helped declarer|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bobholl: good inter mediates :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: most likely only GF values, would transfer and bid new suit with better hand|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dan|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panosk: i agree with Murat 1nt open from S is a gd possible bid|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes    off to a very good start|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kemperg: In OR 3NT on 27, |pg||
nt|knutte: a bit sci-fi I think :)|pg||
nt|panosk: he chose to play with the odds, quite rightly i think |pg||
nt|panosk: the way he played @C gives him 2 chances, either @CQ on side or clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: on side means with E|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kemperg: discard @S looser|pg||
nt|panosk: thats what we call right sided contract|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|panosk: or @D ruff now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d8|nt|gsper:  Establish @S or crossruff?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Difficult choice single dummy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobholl: N almost trump short already|pg||
nt|panosk: but unfortunatelyclubs dont behave|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|STRIK3R: playing @c to be 3-3 is risky :) better hope for some luck in @s I think|pg||
nt|ady: needs clubs 3=3 with honours split  and J@S onside|pg||
nt|sverjohn: He could have made it through a late entry in clubs follwed by a trump finesse|pg||
pc|h6|nt|murat e: declarer can crosruff or establish spades bot are ok but he does not see as we do with open cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andersk: I think Helgemo is max unlucky here. And I totally disagree with 1 NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo have 43 in major, so if partner can bid a major over 1 @d he is normally in very good shape|pg||
nt|andersk: Very unlucky to play 3 NT|pg||
nt|panosk: how do u lose playing in majors after 1NT ?|pg||
nt|andersk: with the favouruble @H 3-3 NS probably would have made 3 @H|pg||
nt|panosk: still he will make|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andersk: 1 NT bad, when partner dont have majors (which he often does not have when you self have 4-3 in MM)|pg||
