nt|mcphee: Russia might gain some back that board|pg||
nt|mcphee: they need some good things to take palce|pg||
nt|ritong: which is totally impossible|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, of course. miscalculated. sorry|pg||
nt|barnets: that was 8 imps for Italy down by 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: still difficult to see sementa card though i have asked to see them|pg||
nt|geot: sure|pg||
nt|sastro: war nicht einfach- der Duck im ersten Stich von Ost ist erklärlich, weil er nicht wusste wer die 9 hält|pg||
nt|roswolf: good defence deserves to earn a swing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no sorry not making|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie popieram Multi na 7 karcie jako rekompensacie si³y  to dla mnie bryd¿ naiwny na turnieje klubowe|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  12 imps, I meant|pg||
nt|riccho:  who cares abotu bidding 6 when at the other table your teammates were able to get a plusscore... :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if you only were able to know it in advance ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: OK, I gotta run ... Bye Geo, kibs!|pg||
nt|geot: bye James|pg||
nt|blum1956: I hope for this too|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be interesting|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kamyk: w 15. na 3BA z reki S W zawistowa³ czwart¹ najlepsza w piki - bêdzie strata|pg||
nt|monde9: I didn' follow well :(|pg||
nt|monde9: the last one|pg||
nt|baldjean: extremely weak opening by N|pg||
mb|1S|nt|solex333: not sure that was the best scenario|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry lost play on the last board..|pg||
mb|2D|an|!H|nt|baldfriede: yes, but as I said, S was afraid of @H, so he did not bid on|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like a possibility for Bulgarians to shorten the gap|pg||
nt|monde9: yes, than i have an excuse :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@H good spade raise|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: no way lauria sits here|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s..|pg||
nt|nilsland:  1NT?|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double for takeout... East have for 3  maybe 4spade|pg||
nt|lesniak: odwaga Cezarego...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|geot: Ireland got a grip on this now, and fully deserved. they have not done anything wrong, and Norway has got a few hands where I do not really recognise my good friends to be honest|pg||
nt|geot: It is the first match only, do not worry Norwegian fans:)|pg||
nt|pauleger: in relation to the other rounds these hands are kind of flat until now|pg||
nt|ritong: well, unexpected|pg||
nt|ritong: no, i naively thought fredin would keep quiet|pg||
nt|tez: assael köksoyun eliyle girmezdi araya|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If N is strong and doubles you can go from 1NT X to 2@H but if 2@H is doubled you cant go back to 1NT :)|pg||
nt|april7: a double dummy 7@H but 6@H  very possible to reach|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  evenly distributed points, and "black" fit for each pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 1 lvl higher here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink was definitely operating on this hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes only a couple of hands had some potential, maybe we will end with a bang with some fancy hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D would show 5 cards for me|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think FF use support doubles|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks as though EW have game on here, but can they bid it?|pg||
nt|star6ija: now 4 @ss|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@s might make ona non diamond lead, not very likelly o this table|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@s makes with diamond too?|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry, on diamond pushes you can discard all hearts from dummy, so 4@s still makes|pg||
nt|star6ija: Aronov knows Stefanov has singleton @d|pg||
nt|geot: right|pg||
nt|sastro: endlich lassen auch die Russen ein paar Imps fallen|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to everyone|pg||
mb|4H|nt|geot: This might be a pick up for Norway|pg||
nt|gulyas: no dbl, no trouble:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: but there are still matches with more imps exchanged. some suprise is that pland is down 40 imps against Croatia|pg||
nt|clinch: Again, lots of bidding from NS|pg||
nt|monde9: -2 here another bad board for Romania|pg||
nt|jbennet: again this board shows that passivity so often creates double partscore swings.  |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w do well in hearts|pg||
nt|murat e: turkey trailing against austria and netherlands may take over third place seems thats all this match matters|pg||
nt|lesniak: bezkompromisowoæ...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now it's not easy to find @s fit on NS|pg||
nt|riccho:  a redouble by S might have helped here|pg||
nt|riccho:  but you should agree about this XX before :) |pg||
nt|riccho:  and N now could X to show @s here as well|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, yes! or to do it AFTER - after finding yourself in 1@c RDBL with 3-2 small cards fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 2NT is more challenging than 2@d in the OR and will probably fail|pg||
nt|clinch: Dbl presumably support; not sure what rdbl was|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Poland has been doing surprisingly poor all rounds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: assael puanlý pik fiti gösteriyor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey çabuk pes etti|pg||
nt|tez: kuzeyin 20 puanla pas geçmesi |pg||
nt|yusufb: kuzey 4@s olunca iþin pesini býraktý|pg||
nt|baardolav: He feel his cards is strong. If 3@s is defined as fight... then more difficult|pg||
nt|star6ija: correct|pg||
nt|baardolav: double can be invite from east|pg||
nt|murat e: threemore boards after this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: very true|pg||
nt|geot: that was a tough double by Helgemo|pg||
nt|barnets: 14 more imps for Italy on bd 14|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm this looks good for italy|pg||
nt|lesniak: Ns maja do wygrania 9-10 lew w kiery|pg||
nt|riccho:  just wondered why S didnt XX |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the 3rd round of Albena teams|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcphee: 4@S a good save|pg||
nt|tomi2: except of their win against France|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Fredin may even make this with a club finess|pg||
nt|barnets: when fantunes X 4@H|pg||
nt|fluffy: on the last board of round 17 I decided against running my diamonds for something like this, jst to find out they had led from KJ985 with the 5, and now they had no comunication ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: when his partner had to play the queen from Q7632|pg||
nt|barnets: instead of taking the save we saw here|pg||
nt|riccho:  but they may have a different agreement|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems so|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://bridge.bg/bg_BG/ranking1089.html for running scores|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, we are following the 1st table|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: yes Bessis probably wrote that up in BBO news|pg||
nt|tomi2: if they get kicked out a new discussion will start about the way the team gets selected|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or without|pg||
nt|ritong: bar is open:)|pg||
nt|jbennet: they sold out to 2 sp and inflicted a well deserved part score swing. East of course will led high d follewd by a trump switch. |pg||
nt|barnets: still another swing for Italy coming here|pg||
nt|baldjean: declarer will try to set up @d|pg||
nt|geot: Another good one for Italy here. Not the right time to play on the 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|barnets: so 31 the lead now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|geot: At the other table Boye Brogeland made this hand simple when he overcalled 4@H over Hanlon's 1@C|pg||
nt|clinch: Good work from NS to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like this move from helness|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs to be on the ball to defeat this |pg||
nt|april7: 6@S is in danger, of losing 1 @S and 1 @H, but the @H losers could be discarded on long @D except on @C leads in lacking of entries to the @D suit, but as we see NS are on the way ...|pg||
nt|april7: to 6 @H|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nilsland:  CocaCola someone?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes please|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, rum and a tiwst of lemon|pg||
nt|mcphee: E knows this one is a make|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has 6 losers|pg||
nt|barnets: east switched a heart at trick 2|pg||
nt|barnets: in open|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2: Germany has made trials first time for 10 years, this team won earlier this year|pg||
nt|clinch: England has played very well against a strong French team (so far)|pg||
nt|fluffy: another line pointed by an spec is to pitch the heart on second/third diamond|pg||
nt|monde9: Coldea's temperament ? 14 PH 1 NT opening ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cross to dummy, H finesse - not so easy for North |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room on their final board  [ 20]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does anybody know Kaplans rule for opening leads|pg||
nt|tez: rakip renk uzunsa çok konuþma..ortakta kýsa olduðu halde konuþmuyorsa..eli çok kötüdür|pg||
nt|yusufb: bizimkilerde býrakmýþ iþin pesini 4 batýrmýþ iyi skor|pg||
nt|gulyas: good lead to beat 3nt:(|pg||
nt|barnets: and that was a trick lost|pg||
nt|sastro: der kontrakt ist nicht zu schlagen|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcphee: best shot is the @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: he would  have 9 tricks now, but the defense has 5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hard job for declarer - guess everything|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yusufb: 2 yada 3 imp alýrýz|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Stuck for a discard|pg||
nt|monde9: W squeezing his partner |pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: playing same boards  France v Iceland   score is 53-30    our match only 21 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: ok i bite  no?|pg||
nt|baldjean: if E takes his @c now it is down|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|tez: 2 imp daha alýrýz|pg||
nt|fluffy: well guys I gotta go to the venue here and hopefully congratulate my team mates fo beating Ireland|pg||
nt|fluffy: see you|pg||
nt|geot: At the other table South doubled the 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks for being with us|pg||
nt|oleberg:  And the next heart vill hurt|pg||
nt|barnets: the tournament needs aresult like this to make it more exciting for the specs|pg||
nt|fluffy: even bigger would make it funnier I'd say|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: link for running scores|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: scores have Monaco making 2@H both ways on 11 for 9 imps so that must be wrong|pg||
nt|mcphee: Bakhshi not grabbing the A of trumps was a good move|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they fixed that quickly :)so Israel maintain a healthy lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: now poor Lauria is awakwardly placed|pg||
nt|murat e: England sittting comfortably at first place|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: adding spotcards?|pg||
nt|star6ija: precision... he doesn't know how many @d his partner has|pg||
nt|barnets: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oleberg:  But a club it must be|pg||
nt|mcphee: ducking?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is also a possible ethical problem for North, although it depends on how long S took to pass the double - we can't always tell the correct speed of the bids |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as the hesitation could only imply (given the srong dummy and the jump to 3NT) that South was thinking of bidding 2@s, and therefore has three spades   |pg||
nt|april7: on a trump lead 13 tricks coming in|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|tomi2: while Poland has nominated a team consisting of two "strongest" pairs and a playing sponsor and his pd|pg||
nt|mcphee: nope|pg||
nt|april7: on a trmp lead though S could make the safety play in @S,protecting against a 1-4 split in @S, but with this lead has to rely ona 2-3 split|pg||
nt|april7: and ofcourse on a 3-2 split in @H|pg||
nt|april7: ace, then 2 trumps and 2 @S and claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOT REALLY|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzgn: Khokhlov thinking|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Lead your queens?|pg||
nt|geot: Yes, but X is an alternative with those cards anyway imo|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pauleger: talking about sponsors... :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in Germany we had no trials but that was like in Italy, it was because there was no real doubt that the team playing is the strongest one|pg||
nt|geot: may easily be be some more imps on this one|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|clinch: Despite the @h misguess, Gold can't put Forrester in to lead a trump without establishing a @d winner for declarer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in these auctions, it's not a bad idea to rasie with Q10x support |pg||
nt|mcphee: good recovery from E|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even this little help from N doesn't work|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lesniak: zobaczymy czy Fisher uwierzy w 12 PC|pg||
pc|h5|nt|geot: interesting lead, trying to find a stiff Q somewhere|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on vugraph he would say God gave you a long sequence so you knew what to lead|pg||
nt|clinch: So still 10 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: HE HAS THE ENTRY TO TAKE THE FINESSE|pg||
nt|roswolf: very good play|pg||
nt|mcphee: it was the J@S that was the concern|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5th place Israel are doing 2-4th every favour as the gap to Monaco closes|pg||
nt|mcphee: here i was thinking we had more Monaco supporters|pg||
nt|mcphee: they are my pick to win|pg||
pc|hK|nt|geot: Gave declarer a stopper|pg||
nt|blum1956: Rudakov-Khokhlov use standard leads against NT so it is not easy for Khokhlov to decode the sequence @c5 -@c4|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=916&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|geot: what a contract, phew|pg||
nt|roswolf: azurri v the anglos explains a lot:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes probably they are a great two pairs but not really Monacon's are they :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|tomi2: Italy have a sponsor (Maria Lavazza) but she acts as a non playing captian|pg||
nt|star6ija: 1 IMP Italy|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Even though the spade was "into the jaw", it guarantees a two-trick set|pg||
nt|monde9: & now East ? :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Unless...|pg||
nt|gulyas: another one of those +6 turns to -5 hands|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes but don't expect to pick many on  16|pg||
nt|roswolf: should get this right in sleep|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|monde9: good def & S could be more inspired |pg||
nt|monde9: Denmark is now very close|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Coldea thinking..|pg||
nt|april7: now the safety play in @S|pg||
nt|april7: ace and then finess the J|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: all that thinking to gain 1 vital imp me thinks|pg||
nt|mcphee: no way|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow - go england|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|monde9: 3 boards left for this hot finish|pg||

nt|yusufb: skor gecerli olmuþ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|nilsland:  a small win to sweden|pg||

nt|riccho:  this looks like another push as well|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW had enough to bid the game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like normal 3NT for EW|pg||
mb|1D|nt|geot: wd, Norway need another good board to even the match|pg||
nt|tomi2: as far as I know Lavazza will try to play more in the future, so we may see her playing in events like this maybe|pg||

nt|riccho:  russia dropped from best ten.|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d = 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and they have only 2 boards left to recover|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: EW will be in 4@s one way or the other|pg||

nt|roswolf: that is a brave michaels vul|pg||

nt|ritong: don t think tor can pass|pg||
nt|baldjean: the scoring is VP, right?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So a possible game swing for France if they can reach 4@h|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 sp was a goos save. as it happned ew had 11 tricks possible in a heart partial. |pg||
nt|mcphee: well passing 1@H strikes me as timid|pg||
nt|roswolf: horror suit quality|pg||
nt|mcphee: options were basically 2@H or a t/o dble|pg||
nt|lesniak: sorry, ns 4 karo|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  9-10-11-12 places - all hve 1 VP margin only|pg||

nt|baardolav: this was a weak opening even for prec players|pg||
nt|monde9: Romania has now many regrets. The winning line of that 4 @H stuff was for me clear. But as usual, it is so easy when you see all the cards :)  |pg||
nt|mcphee: reasonable spot|pg||
nt|ritong: bessis senior likes his two aces|pg||

nt|fluffy: don't you love it when you see the 5-0 break and you are playing NT?|pg||
nt|chick: with the club finesse working, this will be easy, probably an overtrick|pg||
pc|h4|nt|geot: that is how it is, and it will be 10 IMPs whether he gets 11 or 12 tricks|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  the best defence move is to continue @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even when S has no access|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kdr_fm: losing 2@h, one @C ruff and the @SA, no guess unless N underleads the @S now|pg||
nt|monde9: maybe -2 some days :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm, so they end up in 6@S after all|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It has come down to Lauria vs Upmark. Make you bets!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he only has 10 top tricks, so play is very complicated|pg||
nt|clinch: Needs to strip E of his @d s  then throw him in|pg||
nt|clinch: Also needed to play two trumps as now W can trump third @c|pg||
nt|clinch: Perhaps too double-dummy|pg||
nt|clinch: Of course E may think his partner has J @c|pg||
nt|clinch: So defence is not clear|pg||
nt|clinch: If W has QJ10 of @cs|pg||
nt|clinch: will not be right to play a third one|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe I was wrong all along then, sry|pg||
nt|gulyas: @Ss were agreed as trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: The declarer needs not to discard a diamond but he cannot be sure |pg||

nt|ritong: my crystalball is broken  i ll abstain:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4c,3d,3s note clubs not running|pg||
nt|mcphee: not going to see it being redbled|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary making 6@S in the OR, lets see if Mesbur can make it, too|pg||
nt|baldjean: this is a lucky make if declarer ducks now. tricky lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: a good lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: after a passive @C lead, he can set up @Hs easily|pg||
nt|geot: yes:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|baldfriede: percentage play in @s wrong this time, but that's why it is percentage only|pg||
nt|geot: Bulgaria in 3NT at the other table and win 600, and this table N/S do not take a bid at all. Very unusal against Italy|pg||
nt|geot: The opening was creating it, because who of N or S should bid?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 10 I belive  if Aronov maake -3 11 if -2|pg||
nt|tax456: ok. ma su 60 mani il carry over conta il 10%|pg||
nt|star6ija: Stefanov did it well here|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see how he plays it - running it gives the contract immediately|pg||
nt|sastro: der AS weiss noch nicht, dass er den Kontrakt nicht verlieren kann|pg||
pc|d5|nt|clinch: or, indeed, he may think Forrester has 4 @s|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|pauleger: 11 even ;)|pg||
nt|mcphee: all down hill from here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and it's a matter of overtrick - either declarer plays for double finess in @c or not|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: so @Hs have to be set up|pg||

nt|fluffy: so 5 back to monaco|pg||

pc|d2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: went down in open room by not testing clubs immediately|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i expect lauria will figure this out|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think testing clubs first is better. keeps entries fluid and tells you how many extra tricks you beed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but is still not clear|pg||
nt|nilsland:  now its the time to play hearts - you "know" spades is offside|pg||
nt|oleberg:  -2 easily possible|pg||
nt|chick: declarer doesn't know the @SA is onside, so will worry about losing to the @SA in E and another diamond through|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nilsland:  and need 1+ heart trick|pg||
nt|oleberg:  No, wrong again|pg||

nt|monde9: 4 @S seems so cool but I saw that "major accident" happens sometimes|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Yes, it could be missed on a (very) bad day|pg||
nt|gulyas: the bad news is, we may end up behind both, and be eliminated|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, 2 last boards of the match and of the Euro Open Teams 2012 for these 2 teams |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and the same problem - 6@h or @d is OK, but not so grand slam|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kdr_fm: the @D lead on the previous board tempted declarer into playing the @C's 3/3 for a @d discard in which case the contract could be made so -2|pg||
nt|psyck: this is not easy|pg||
nt|pauleger: lauria will pass I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: straightforward game here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  due to unlucky @h position|pg||
nt|vugraphzet: NS play strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: Very tight and nice match... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not what West wanted to hear|pg||
nt|baldjean: this board was passed out at the other table|pg||
mb|2H|nt|geot: I said the previous won was mini mini as it on a bad day was 12 losers|pg||
nt|geot: but this one is even weaker in terms of HCPs|pg||
nt|psyck: pass may work as 4@h may go down|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden in 7 here - without success|pg||
nt|baardolav: 33 33... 3@h non vul preemtive style|pg||
nt|geot: I wonder how the weak 3@H bid is defined, if he may have something like KQ or AQ to six|pg||
nt|geot: or if that is too strong|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double ask if Bocchi have max|pg||
nt|oleberg:  My guess is, it would be bid 95% of the time (more or less)|pg||

nt|mcphee: i would have guessed @D wrong:(|pg||
nt|barnets: after the barrage|pg||
nt|barnets: can make game in diamonds|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Precision club seems to be very popular in Bulgaria |pg||

nt|fluffy: north can go contructive or preemptive, he went for constructive|pg||

nt|mcphee: 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czyje na wierzchu?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: well 4@h can make too i suppose, esp as bidding marks cards|pg||
nt|psyck: making some endplay on North possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant nothing works after the heart pitch, we could all see how to make it|pg||
nt|baardolav: Madala scans the records... and try to estimate if Bocchi can have 2 hounours in @h now...|pg||
nt|geot: He goes on in the hope that the heart suit is stronger|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S is some form of a wk2, but S thinks this has play, and he is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: 6@c works fine here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pitching anything but a heart on the third club gives up on various other chances|pg||
nt|clinch: on last hand|pg||
nt|sastro: möchte mal wissen, was der Partner mit seiner gepassten Hand alles haben soll damit mehr als 4 <<<<pik gehen- vielleicht noch 5, aber wo sollen denn 6 herkommen|pg||
nt|riccho:  in the moment, russia needs another VP to gut into top10|pg||
nt|riccho:  2VP because they lost the match vs france |pg||
mb|4D|nt|henryb:  But maybe playing a heart before playing the third club preserves some chances|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe 5@H could have been an alternative?|pg||
nt|monde9: now plus 1 costs some points |pg||
nt|jbennet: so 3NT cant work. |pg||

nt|kdr_fm: again 3NT by E/W could come hope if the defence not careful - 4@H has no chance off 2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  running scores for this group http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=917&qroundno=1&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is not a lead he enjoys|pg||
nt|ritong: this type of auction will not exist anymore soon|pg||
nt|ritong: with gazzilli, etc|pg||
nt|riccho:  top10 are able to send a team to the prestigious champions cup in israel this year|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mcphee: @D lead best|pg||
nt|psyck: best would be to set up a @d ruff here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  At the other table South opened 1@C and thus was favourite to hold the @DK - so a little bit unlucky for sweden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room south opened so the grand odds were different than at this table, ie a bit unlucky the diamond king offside|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh maybe with this lead he is up to 11 without the trump guess|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@h looks very timid|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Since trumps are 3-2 and clubs 3-3 the contract makes automatically|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Not an unreasonable double. The opponents hands fit miracolously|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: still, may survive - depends on the way E plays the diamonds|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S by S, but an unaccessable dummy, now going even 2 down|pg||
nt|barnets: very nicely done e/w|pg||
nt|jbennet: wd east..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open Room just finished play|pg||
nt|fluffy: wonder what redouble showed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: y, but not exactly a claimer:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: with @sA wellplaced|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps easts 4N suggested a slam try i diamonds  in case west was much stronger|pg||
nt|barnets: west about minimum for bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: so what about the 3spade bid (many uses that to show "i have 4 suoort plus minimum"|pg||
nt|barnets: the xx is a psychic manouver by north|pg||
mb|5D|nt|fabsayc: well we covered that :)|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: dì a wald di mandare anche a te programma dirette bbo su tua mail|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: there is an hallucinant bid, other room|pg||
nt|ritong: bocchi's double of 4@h|pg||
nt|clinch: I think 2@d confirmed a 17-19 balanced hand in N|pg||
nt|geot: On a diamond lead declarer must fly ace and cash three rounds of clubs to win|pg||
nt|geot: 3-3 clubs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they will soom discover @hQ is missing |pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: South opened in this room with 8HCP, mini NT. In the other room North opened the bidding in third seat with 9HCPs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: coming up on final board of the match|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is tricky even now|pg||
nt|monde9: if Coldea doesn't try a finesse in @S|pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps behaving, this is 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|sastro: soll mal vorsichtig spielen, damit er 4 erfüllt|pg||
mb|5H|nt|gulyas: if left to his own devices, declarer will go down|pg||
nt|jbennet: theory says that t is effective to use 3sp as a "preempt" (4 support but minimum."|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: As 1@c could have been a number of weaker hands|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
mb|6H|nt|baldfriede: well done to find 6@c|pg||
nt|psyck: duly done|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bbodaki en yüksek nüfusa sahip ülkelerden biri olmamýzýn avantajý olsa gerek bu|pg||
nt|baldjean: this will be a quick claim|pg||
nt|chick: lucky for S that the @C8 is onside, so the 97 is a stopper|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we're acutally NOT the slowest vugraph table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores under  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our match is from Group B|pg||
nt|tomi2: im Moment wäre ein Überstich für Deutschland auch ein Siegpunkt|pg||
nt|sastro: denke mal West macht es dem Partner einfacher, wenn er @H-Dame zugibt|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: well, he was not|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well actually on that lead it maybe possible to set up the 4th @D (duck the @S entry to the N hand)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  He wont|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We expect 2 down - or more?|pg||
nt|roswolf: could make 12 if he gets the trumps right|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but 5-4 fit may well allow to bid high or not?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good stop as well|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|tez: diðer masa da da ayný|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ryskiel_: nie zauwa¿y³em ¿e Zmuda z tej lewy zrezygnowa³, s³uszbie czy mo¿e na z³oc Balowi? |pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: he may still go down if S, upon winning the @HK, plays the @DQ for N to discard his @H|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs to play 2 rnds of @Hs eventually to ruff the 3rd|pg||
nt|gulyas: so either @HA-Q, or just Q, S wins and plays the @DQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: is no duck N has a certain @s entry ...|pg||
nt|star6ija: now @d switch will make it very tough|pg||
nt|oleberg:  That would make his handling of heart-losers to troublesome|pg||
nt|geot: Nunes in 3NT bd 16 and got a spade lead! where Helness led the @HK|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oleberg:  Taking the @SK and running clubs virtually guarantees ten tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: did East really bid 4NT with 5 high?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baardolav: three round of cllubs and crossruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is signoff  so  min/max doesn't really apply|pg||
nt|tisserand: undo|pg||
nt|barnets: right it is purely barrage|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzgn: lost the play basically|pg||
nt|barnets: i think he made it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|tomi2: this seems the wrong 7|pg||
nt|psyck: hmm @c not @h surely|pg||
nt|ozgull: arkadaþlar irlanda dan selamlar|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he's ok - a diamond goes on the spade queen|pg||
nt|barnets: no he didnt|pg||
pc|hK|nt|blum1956: The typical examle of multiple choices - the kind of hand which few declarers like|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, claim fine|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tabii ki skor tabelasýnda yukarýda olursak daha çok maçýmýz yayýnlanýr|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  so, Russian has found 6 necessary imps|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: last hand now, thanks everybody, restart in about 1 hour and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|baardolav: 140 ew par score... |pg||
nt|gulyas: Ireland making a partscore, this may be duplicated here|pg||
nt|barnets: he can make it on spade lead but will he ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: letztes Board, morgen warten Frankreich, Polen und Monaco, wieder drei dicke Brocken, dafür können davon ausgehen, dass die Jungs wieder im Vugraph gezeigt werden|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcphee: england gains lead in B I think if they push this one|pg||
nt|oleberg:  They virtually had a day off yesterday|pg||
nt|riccho:  didnt mean the N action, but the result in getting to 2@h at all from NS |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt works here for E/W, but if N interferes it may not be found|pg||
nt|blum1956: This probably ends with 4@h N|pg||
nt|tomi2: cards could not be friendlier, I think 6@H could make if they bid it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Sweden EW stopped in 3@S |pg||

nt|mdgraham: it will be interesting to see what the other table does with 17, 18, and 19|pg||
nt|fluffy: the incredible club lay out makes 5@c the making contract|pg||
nt|geot: Nunes went one down on bd 16 (3NT), 7 IMPs to Monaco|pg||
nt|sastro: letzte Hand - ich danke allen Zuschauern und insbesondere unserem Operator. Der russischen Mannschaft herzlichen Glückwunsch zum Sieg|pg||
nt|mcphee: bidding misunderstand this hand for England|pg||

nt|roswolf: this could end up in a bloodbath|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yusufb: selamm levent bolþanss|pg||
nt|star6ija: non-forcing|pg||
nt|monde9: 3 NT on South ? :)|pg||
nt|april7: a trial bid by N and then 4@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SK doubleton onside, clubs 4-4, hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|psyck: see, i told you cards will slowly get exciting towards the end :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S = any shortnes, weak or strong|pg||
nt|ozgull: önemli maçlarýmýzdan biri üstgruba skorumuz taþýnacaðý için kazanmak önemli umarýmson bord birþey olmaz 18 çok iyi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iyi oynayan millilerimize de|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks to our excellent operator MArtin|pg||
nt|mcphee: not overly fond of this t/o dble frankly|pg||
nt|roswolf: what was 1@h?|pg||
nt|lesniak: tutaj jest do wygrania tylko 8 lew na kiery(chyba ze widne)|pg||
mb|r|nt|psyck: 2@s=any spl 5-8 or 12-14|pg||
nt|tomi2: hmmmmmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: their notes say 4m = minor void|pg||
nt|tomi2: so I would think this bid would show @C void and no @D void in north|pg||
nt|pauleger: S won´t believe the @c void :)|pg||
nt|clinch: It's been good bridge, I think - not obviously swingy hands, but England have handled them very well|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is some form of multi?|pg||
nt|fluffy: ahh 18-19 balanced mexican |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  partscore battle. NS are allowed for 7 tricks in  NT/@s, but EW - for 8-9 tricks in @h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
nt|baldfriede: that was somewhat keen by E, considering he has no @h stoppers|pg||
nt|clinch: To hold France to less than 2 IMPs per board is very well done|pg||
nt|tez: 2d yý 18 19 dengeli oynuyorlar|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet cýkacak olan takýmlardan alýnan puanlar onemli 18 iyi skor|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Fitting reply from partner|pg||
nt|oleberg:  3-3-2-5 not so fitting|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not doubled any of those occasions|pg||
nt|murat e: on 17 austria went down on dia slam turkey back to third place|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: but they have sequences where "first step = high shortnes, 2nd step = lowest shortnes" could apply. Hope they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|nemeo: sorry sorry private :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  The only way not to be in a 8-card fit|pg||
nt|monde9: a X from Coldea ? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes confirmed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: confirmed down one|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm serendipity!?|pg||
nt|lesniak: zobaczymy czy Bal spasuje|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 dwn is likely here |pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@c X is -200|pg||
nt|nemeo: a me questa foto piace molto di più, l'altra molto meno (diciamo che qui mi riconosco mentre nell'altra ho la solita faccia di quando devo sorridere per forza), mi chiedevo solo ...|pg||
nt|nemeo: quale può andare meglio per lo scopo che interessa...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Par score is 140 EW|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@s|pg||
nt|baardolav: The result from OR|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Still, getting out of 1nt is going to be fine|pg||
nt|monde9: His temperament was calm than :)|pg||
nt|oleberg:  X would probably have been take-out|pg||
nt|lesniak: swietnie zrobi³|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Gromov must be most accurate to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: all on the @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: thank you|pg||
nt|ozgull: herkese iyi günler iyidilekleriniz  bizle olsun|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bugün baþka maç yok|pg||
nt|tez: 3 nt oluyor|pg||
nt|gulyas: E 'nevergiveup' Fitzgibbon bids one more|pg||
nt|mcphee: here was Lauria trying to help them avoid @H and no one beleived him except Versace:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks very odd|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the double was awful really|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it may bring 13 more imps for Russia and comeback to top-10|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: yes, this is what the notes say: If OPENER bids 2M over 2M-1, RESP can continue with 2NT asking, showing a side suit or  a splinter.|pg||
nt|april7: W hsould have already opened 3@H, and now NS were kept out of 4@S|pg||
nt|lesniak: AKxxx, KDxxx , xx, x by³by nieprzyjemny...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: merytoryczny komentarz jutro jesz po jedny meczu w Open i w Seniorach, W open gramy z Norwegi¹ w seniorach z Francj¹|pg||
nt|lesniak: a nawet AKxxx, Kxxxx, xx, x|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêkujê wszystkim a szczególnie Marcinowi Leniewskiemu za merytoryczny komentarz|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gulyas: the answer is: they don't|pg||
nt|2celik1: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots of chatter over this hand from the specs|pg||
nt|mcphee: play on @D which cuold lead to going down|pg||
nt|blum1956: if there is a trump loser then the diamond guess is inevitable, from Gromov's point of view... Also, he does not know that the diamond ruff is possible...|pg||
nt|mcphee: or trump a @S on dummy to take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: i prefer the @S ruff to try trump finesse|pg||
nt|mcphee: we can see from up here he could just bang down A@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: but I think that is unlikely|pg||
nt|blum1956: playing a diamond to the King creates one more problem - the 4th diamond in dummy...|pg||
nt|2celik1: @d atagina oyuncu dogru koyup koz empasi yapmazsa dahi olabiliyor|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even Gromov will not be quick in declaring this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Thanks to his fast play earlier he has nearly an hour to decide on his line|pg||
nt|mcphee: one @D can go on J@C|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Not many pairs would copy that bidding|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4 card @S invite|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  rather 9. even after 3 rounds of trump, declarer has enough time to clear @s |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|geot: So most likely a push, and this ends as a small win for Ireland|pg||
nt|kamyk: tu siê nic wielkiego nie stanie; dziekujê i dobranoc|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia:)|pg||
nt|blum1956: This should go down in the 6th trick|pg||
nt|blum1956: Suppose he plays a diamond to the Queen now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 4@S is plain and simple an overbid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yarýnki 3 maçtan hangisinin yayýnlanacaðý akþam belli oluyor|pg||
nt|tez: @c dam 3lü|pg||
nt|geot: Noone will double 4@C here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: E has taken a bit of a view here, not supporting spades|pg||
nt|lesniak: :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  now W should be able to get 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: Nunes would also lead @C3 from  @CQ73|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 9 tricks may come from 4@S, 3@C 1@D & 1@H.  But N/S at that point should be able to cash 1C 2@d + 2@H - I don't see this making|pg||
nt|baardolav: Now probably Italy will win with 1 imp...|pg||
nt|star6ija: or with 7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|clinch: Good lead; makes 4 on a @s lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bana iletiliyor ve ben de TBF web sayfasýnda yayýnlanmasý için bildiriyorum|pg||
nt|gulyas: this can be beaten by playing trumps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tomi2: 3NT is defined as @S void, so 4@C could be @D void and 4@D club void|pg||
nt|psyck: guess they knew what they were doing anyway|pg||
nt|pauleger: everybody knows the situation holding 2 aces against a bid slam :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: most of the time it is bad to lead one of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: N and E are sitting on the same screen side, so if N thinks his bidding shows @D void he will tell this to Lauria|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|gulyas: just like that, yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 18 the english are in 3@H - GO ENGLAND:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|clinch: Less than 1 IMP per board of course|pg||
nt|tez: diðer masada 1 nt oynanýyor|pg||
nt|baardolav: Can be 2 down... |pg||
nt|geot: He is more likely to go 2 down than winning this|pg||
nt|mcphee: or weakish?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I like that Irish spirit. too bad it did not help in the European soccer championships|pg||
nt|mcphee: S had the problem of dble likely having a meaning other than we belong in @H not them|pg||
nt|mcphee: but this should handle ok really|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this seems to be cold|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Iceland lead Bulgaria 62-ZERO|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: it may be that east bid 1@d (transfer) and not 1@h a spec suggests|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: versace has the worst possible diamond holding after the double|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and 3@S prob making in other room will be 8 imps to sweden|pg||
nt|star6ija: right|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Declarer doesn't really want to play any suits|pg||
nt|monde9: it's depending on agreements|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like  swing for netherlands on last board|pg||
nt|barnets: with Italy too high|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: as long as the director lets the OR score stand, this is a huge gain for Hungary|pg||
nt|mcphee: so down he goesa|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would be a problem if the opening lead was on the other side and south would explain "i dont know what this shows"|pg||
nt|nilsland:  thanks for watching|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room defended very well but 1 down for "sure"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: on first card by dummy it was overturned too quickly to be sure but wont by ew|pg||
nt|barnets: good shot by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: this hand so far ok|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|geot: I expect both these teams to be in the fight in this Championship, for top 6, but maybe also possibly for medals if they are at their best. Good luck!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: been informed the other room result is incorrect - 3NT -1 whch given Tom + Hugh's record of bdding vul games would be more consistent|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani www.tbricfed.org.tr adresini takip ediniz|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|geot: so this will decide the match. 9 tricks = Italy wins, 8 tricks= BUL wins|pg||
nt|star6ija: but this is still 15-15|pg||
nt|geot: I put my money on Bulgaria here|pg||
nt|baardolav: If Bocchi start with AK heart... and heart for ruff... it is easy for stefanov to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|geot: it will likely be 15-15 anyway, but the imps:)|pg||
nt|star6ija: @D jack shows @d ratherthan @h|pg||
nt|szeryf: Muller spasowa³ z rêk¹ S na otwarciu! graj¹ 1 kiera|pg||
nt|star6ija: @S Jack|pg||
nt|baardolav: I think bocchi start with @d 8|pg||

pc|h9|nt|fluffy: well was a very good match to watch, thx everybody and hope you didn't criticize much the nonsense I said|pg||
nt|fluffy: cheers|pg||
nt|geot: Monaco will most likely lose bd 18, so Italy seems to win this match in the 19-11 or 20-10 area|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: Vigorous discussion between Madala and Bocchi during and after that hand.|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so Italy wins by 2 imps, thats 16-14? maybe 15-15|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, 15-15 I am told - now we just need the declarer's decision on this bd from the OR to get the final result|pg||
nt|gulyas: next round starts in abt 25mins (17:40 CET)|pg||
nt|gulyas: the format is a double round robin: first, 2 groups play a RR for abt a week (17 rnds)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then the top 9 teams from both groups advance to RR2|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play each other, but taking the results from the advancing teams along, only playing the other 9 teams|pg||
nt|gulyas: final result is determined by total VPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, the result shows online as here, so I assume that means the director let the score stand, Italy may appeal|pg||
nt|gulyas: small correction from Roland: 18 rnds, including a bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the final result is 15-15, appeal pending (maybe)|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly an entertaining match, come see us again in 20 mins for rnd3|pg||
nt|gulyas: made the 4@H call easy after the reopen|pg||
nt|clinch: So this looks to be a flat board... thanks everyone for bearing with me - see you tomorrow!|pg||
nt|geot: easy way is to take the diamond ruff for one down|pg||
nt|geot: He must NOT take the ace and switch to a heart|pg||
nt|lesniak: a nawet AKxxx, Kxxx, AWx, x|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: anything that could work, works, @s Kx, @h22, @c44, etc.|pg||
nt|gulyas: 8-10th place very close, but Hungary having the easiest opps, Portugal, have a chance|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 imps for 3@H geoffrey|pg||
