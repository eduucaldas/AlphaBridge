nt|niekbrink: We get Helmich and Hop now. Currently 4th|pg||
nt|adriaantje: sorry, appearantly west was declarer in 2@S at the other vugraph table, so that was Hop and not Helmich|pg||
nt|adriaantje: wasn't aware of the other bidding sequence|pg||
nt|adriaantje: Hop's brother corrected me immediately :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: klukowski - zatorski now 3rd. They might not even win a medal, although they were leading by 6,5% early afternoon...|pg||
