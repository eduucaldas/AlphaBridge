mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|henryb:  A tricky problem for E. I am sure we would all bid 3N, but 4@s is a much better contract|pg||

nt|prasun1966: ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he might solve it. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Or rather, perhaps he should. He knows declarer has at least three spades, two clubs, and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|henryb:  as winners. So the only hope is that declarer has the stiff @hK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was counting tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  And partner, who did not preempt in first seat has to have a reason|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|henryb:  North is likely to play this in 2N or 3N after opening 2N in fourth seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  After two rounds of @d, he has 3@s, 1@h, 1@d and 1@c|pg||
nt|prasun1966: N will have to believe the @S10 to make this contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  He needs three more tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of these can come from the fourth spade, but he still needs two tricks from somewhere|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mackulky:  both play and defense will be interesting|pg||
