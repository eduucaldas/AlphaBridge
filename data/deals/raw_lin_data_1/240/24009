mb|p|nt|mackulky:  The same line up for Manyawar |pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphzhz: GOOD MORNING ALL OF YOU|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  A tricky problem for E. I am sure we would all bid 3N, but 4@s is a much better contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||

nt|prasun1966: 2@S here is 4-4 minor opening hand |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Now a tricky problem for S.|pg||
nt|prasun1966: ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he might solve it. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Or rather, perhaps he should. He knows declarer has at least three spades, two clubs, and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|henryb:  as winners. So the only hope is that declarer has the stiff @hK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was counting tricks|pg||
nt|thak: hi|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mackulky:  easy 9 tricks for Raju |pg||
nt|thak: declarer probably wd've been happier to be in 3N|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|thak: @DA and a @S he needs to get it right|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|prasun1966: difficult for S to take @SA and Play @HA|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  And if declarer has only the stiff @hK. he will have five diamonds, therefore ...|pg||
nt|thak: will need to guess anyway|pg||
nt|thak: with @D J not surviving|pg||
nt|thak: not knowing the 4-1 break, he's likely to play @CA , T to J planning to ruff @H 9 and a @S pitch on @D J|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzhz: PLAY WAS DELAYED DUE TO APEAL|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|henryb:  And partner, who did not preempt in first seat has to have a reason|pg||

nt|sandipdang:  with contract right sided 6nt shd roll home always|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|mackulky:  EW can get ypto 4@S |pg||
nt|psyck: other room seems to be having some connection problems|pg||
mb|1S|nt|thak: this was strange, if laltu held @SA, he'd surely 've held onto winner @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: E and W r playing Strong @C  while NS r playing 2/1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|thak: @S problem was resolved for suhas, and he still got it wrong..|pg||
mb|d|nt|thak: imaginative raise by arun|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe operator will let us know if 2@d showed just @s or something more|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  North is likely to play this in 2N or 3N after opening 2N in fourth seat|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s likely as @h raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  After two rounds of @d, he has 3@s, 1@h, 1@d and 1@c|pg||
nt|prasun1966: N will have to believe the @S10 to make this contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  He needs three more tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of these can come from the fourth spade, but he still needs two tricks from somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  both play and defense will be interesting|pg||
nt|mackulky:  but I believe Declerer should prevail in the end|pg||
nt|figo:  E hand better than just a sign off |pg||
nt|psyck: anyway normal contract reached|pg||

nt|prasun1966: Last hand also S led @HQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  but he needs two entries to dummy|pg||

nt|thak: that's quite a pause|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mackulky:  and @C hons placed favourably|pg||

pc|sA|nt|prasun1966: Yes it is:)|pg||

nt|figo:  arun must be saying sorry to suhas |pg||
nt|psyck: surprised at the play, Arun is normally very good|pg||
nt|thak: perhaps arun happy to settle for -50 given that he doesn't see 4@H being defended..|pg||
nt|figo:  ok friends , gtg now , happy viewing , bye |pg||
nt|nkgupt: ruffing low hardly made any sense:)|pg||

nt|psyck: Thx Arvind|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mackulky:  so Manyawar still have some space to make up some|pg||
nt|prasun1966: EW can make 4@H  high-card doesnot permit though|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Difficult for N to enter into here in vulnerable position and would be dengerous also |pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: x by s?not  many's choice for sure|pg||
nt|thak: 6 hands no swing in a row. don't see that every day..|pg||
mb|1N|nt|subhranp: after 3 sets, formidables were leading 89-63 |pg||
nt|prasun1966: Great Satya took the right decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|psyck: 4 swingly deals follow though|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp:  that is some aggressive bidding and as the cards are it makes.|pg||
nt|pappoo: will probably go 3NT 4NT and north has to decide whether to go on|pg||
nt|nkgupt: suspect all one way|pg||
nt|psyck: could well be|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mackulky:  good lead|pg||
nt|jain: trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  what will RV play after winning?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: why not jain? what will u bid ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: pass 1s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  the defense started on correct foot and RV needs to comliment it by @H Q or 9 |pg||
nt|nkgupt: 8 they played @s part making only 9|pg||
nt|thak: here comes first of those|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mackulky:  is there any news on the position of the other match ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: NO|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe more dangerous to come in over 2@S or 2@H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|mackulky:  well done|pg||
nt|subhranp:  6s is on|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  yes but is anybody going to get there?|pg||
nt|pappoo: this probably shows some interest and a 5 card suit    i am guessing i do not know their methods|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|subhranp:  well if anyone wants to recover then can reach there|pg||
nt|pappoo: other room stopped in 3NT so a likey 13 imp pickup for the texans!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|sandipdang:  shd be 12 trks easy|pg||
nt|thak: 7 to DSM for aggressive bidding and good guessing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mackulky:  nw a duck |pg||
nt|pappoo: shud play back a club|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pappoo: putting the declarer to test|pg||
pc|h5|nt|subhranp: can make 6 here|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|mackulky:  all caards favourable for W and shud be duplicated|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mackulky:  it looks Raju will manage at the most 4 tricks and may be a fifth by some endplay if the defense falters |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|nkgupt: what time next set pramod jee|pg||
nt|prasun1966: stl -2|pg||

pc|sA|nt|mackulky:  so a minor swing of 3 imps to manyawar|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 2@H was only there  if N could have played the 2nd @C|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|s6|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mackulky:  @D 8 was vital|pg||
pc|c6|nt|thak: nothing Arun can do now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|subhranp:  diamond switch and duck by south was required|pg||
pc|cT|nt|subhranp:  on B51 some relief for railways again as texans went down in 4S, so only a 7imp loss|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|psyck: yes play could go similar to other room with just @h finesse extra to make 4@h here|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|subhranp:  West in the other room prefering to treat the hand as weak 2 hand and stayed a level lower.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|prasun1966: In the other Semi-Final  TexanAces is playing against Indian Railway|pg||
nt|prasun1966: -1 or '='  let us see|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any run from 1ntX as on the other tbl they wud be in 300 zone .....|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mackulky:  he decides to play for the split hon in @H|pg||
nt|subhranp:  not sure who is at fault but they got to go back and discuss this|pg||
nt|subhranp:  railways have gained 6imps on B24 to take the lead as the DSM pair in the other room played in 2H and went down|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mackulky:  well this shud be a huge swing as i am told in the other table Texans are in 6@D |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: for the trump lead North shd have long @Hs .. so cross ruff must be safe|pg||
nt|thak: given that sumit and bhabesh are partners majority of the time, and all 4 part of same regular team. It is not surprising that auction was identical|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sandipdang:  yes - this one is all abt partnership understanding|pg||
