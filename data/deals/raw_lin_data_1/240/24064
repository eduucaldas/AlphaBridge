nt|Walddk2: Hello kids, welcome|pg||
nt|adriaantje: Good morning to all|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|pelu:  close to slam - making on a non-@D-lead|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pauleger: Hi Adriaan, it was hard for me to get up that early, I am still really tired, same with you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sadly for EW, South has a natural D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless .....|pg||
nt|pelu:  or his singleton|pg||
nt|adriaantje: I woke up naturally so I feel well now :)|pg||

mc|10|nt|adriaantje: down 2?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tried to set up clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: got overruffed when he ruffed low is my guess|pg||
nt|adriaantje: it was well worth a try|pg||

nt|pelu:  and the system - from start - is that NS move as EW and a new NS-pair - later we hope that TD will give us a "top-table" with the leading pairs|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This time slam can actually make, but you need to guess on a club lead|pg||
nt|adriaantje: NS can make 6@D here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D that is|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2NT is a GF relay in Norway|pg||
nt|adriaantje: 2NT appearantly some sort of relay|pg||
nt|adriaantje: ok|pg||
nt|pauleger: N/S are world champions in Board-a-Match last year in Opatija|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No slam when South never mentioned his diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  1NT  ;  3@D    would work better|pg||
nt|pelu:  on a @c-lead decl need to finess in @h and not in @s - likely to go down on @c-lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu:  in 6@d|pg||
nt|pelu:  modern trend: only bid majors |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Needless to say, Gazzilli would get you to 6@D with ease|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C as a relay is obviously much more economical than 2NT|pg||
mc|9|nt|adriaantje: downside is you lose the natural bid of 2@C, but in Gazilli you can have both|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|adriaantje: let's see whether EW will get to 4@H|pg||
nt|pauleger: is West too strong for 1@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|pelu:  1Â½@h|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|adriaantje: maximum for his 1@H bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pauleger: I am getting told, that 1@d would have been a weak hand and 1@h is 7-10 with 4+@h|pg||
nt|adriaantje: isn't it an alternative to bid 1NT instead of 2@D? You'd also show 18-19 bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|adriaantje: ah|pg||
nt|pelu:  2@D forcing (asking) 3@S = 5-3-3-2 - 7-10 HCP|pg||
nt|adriaantje: 1NT would be something different as well then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@Dis artificial, 18+ with at least 3 hearts|pg||
