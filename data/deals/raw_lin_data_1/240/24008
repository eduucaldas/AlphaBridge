pc|d4|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  A tricky problem for E. I am sure we would all bid 3N, but 4@s is a much better contract|pg||

nt|prasun1966: ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he might solve it. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Or rather, perhaps he should. He knows declarer has at least three spades, two clubs, and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|henryb:  as winners. So the only hope is that declarer has the stiff @hK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was counting tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||

mb|d|mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|psyck: maybe operator will let us know if 2@d showed just @s or something more|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  North is likely to play this in 2N or 3N after opening 2N in fourth seat|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s likely as @h raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  After two rounds of @d, he has 3@s, 1@h, 1@d and 1@c|pg||
nt|prasun1966: N will have to believe the @S10 to make this contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  He needs three more tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of these can come from the fourth spade, but he still needs two tricks from somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  both play and defense will be interesting|pg||
nt|mackulky:  but I believe Declerer should prevail in the end|pg||

nt|jain: another flat br|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  and Texan are in an early lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|figo:  1H relay here |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, that would be a fair prediction with tese players|pg||
nt|figo:  1C is art strong |pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  shud be home with the evn break in @H|pg||
nt|jain: but for sure a very shabby opening by E.precision players just open on any 11 counts:(|pg||

nt|alok_daga: a v heavy 2hrts.14 facing 9 a 3nt .defence will be tested|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: Few and may be nobody is so brave to deffend a partsocre DBL against a player like Anilji:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|figo:  trsf here is not so much abt whom plays in spades ( S has already bid 1S ) |pg||

nt|mackulky:  -2 looks a cheap save as NS cud make 3 NT |pg||

pc|hA|nt|mackulky:  now quick claim for 11|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mackulky:  but with EW each holding two suits 7 carders shud be a push |pg||

nt|sandipdang:  or ruff a club and a heart in dummy?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mackulky:  4@H is not clearcut for EW |pg||

nt|psyck: here with those majors, it was a clear raise for me|pg||

mb|2C|nt|mackulky:  4 sessions of 14 or 6 sessions of 14|pg||
nt|jain: pramodjee,r u ard |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good hand to respond 3@S showing a gf hand with 5-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|jain: a grand in @S|pg||
nt|pappoo: 3NT for NS is a make here|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: deal no 5 gave Formidables 8 imps. Brave attempt by Venky there to pass 3@C dbl|pg||
nt|subhranp:  4s makes here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sunsamvar: and then North can see that hios points are gold and go on to small slam atleast|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: retrf and settle in 3@s?|pg||
nt|subhranp:  3c probably bid by east|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2@C= good raise and dbl is 3 card @S support|pg||
nt|jain: i m sure mrs nadar wont miss this grand|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jain: a decent slam ,not sure how come it was missed in the oher room|pg||
nt|subhranp: 2c might get West excited|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: 4h 4nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good hand for S to ask RKC too :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jain: guess he must b hungry nd having lunch:)|pg||
nt|subhranp: 6nt can make from west hand here|pg||
nt|subhranp:  well, 4h is a bit of a desperate bid|pg||
nt|jaggys: once N cue bids 4 H and key cards are found 7 will be bid|pg||
nt|pappoo: not sure they will get there though!|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: looks like -1|pg||
nt|subhranp:  this looks like another bad board for Railways|pg||
nt|pappoo: maybe a 3D rebid by north could have propelled them|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: SANDEEP IN DEEP THOUGHT|pg||
nt|jain: hi pramod jee|pg||
nt|jain: 3nt shd b serious slam try i guess|pg||
nt|prasun1966: deal 69 and 70 may give Texanaces some handsome imps|pg||
nt|jain: operator?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzhz: 6 SESS OF 14|pg||
nt|jain: pramodjee is around nd he wld let us know the format soon|pg||
nt|jaggys: are they having an accident?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: NO MISTAKE|pg||
nt|jain: hello jaggy|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: THEY R IN 4 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  the lead shud make it an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: 4 SESSIONS TODAY AND 2 TOMORROW HALF DAY REST TOMORROW|pg||
nt|mackulky:  attacking @CQ wud give many headaches|pg||
nt|jain: so each team plays 84 brds against each other nd the top 2 qualify for the semifinals spot along with indian railways nd DSM,is that right pramodjee|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: DARE|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oops. this is certainly a missed opportunity for Formidables|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mackulky:  re hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: brave pass by Srini, but will pay off here|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzhz: THIS IS KNOCKOUT|pg||
nt|jain: hi makarand|pg||
nt|subhranp: I think 3nt probably showing a 15-16hcp hand?|pg||
nt|jaggys: this shd add to the woes of formidables|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp:  EW having a bad session here|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: ps cud beat it w/ a @s switch|pg||
nt|psyck: @h lead may doom slam here|pg||
mb|6C|nt|figo:  here comes the first slam of the finals |pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: @S shift could have done well to get -1  now it makes|pg||
nt|pappoo: 3NT and 5 of either minor makes because of the DK being onside|pg||
mb|6D|nt|jain: shd b extras else why 4th suit nd 3nt,he cld have bid 3nt over over 2c also|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|nkgupt: makes i think any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: like in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mackulky:  It still is a close one with only 20 IMps seperating the two and three more sessions to go after this |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nkgupt: need to ruff 1@d low and last high|pg||
nt|psyck: this takes away entry to @c & trumps don't break, there may be some DD way to make still|pg||
nt|thak: hi|pg||
nt|thak: shd make easy, suhas's not having a @S helps, he can't play a 2nd round|pg||
nt|figo:  hi |pg||

nt|sunsamvar: @S return was not the best from both sides|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i guess when N bid 1@S on the moth eaten suit , he was heading for trouble|pg||

nt|pappoo: so a possible swing to railways|pg||
nt|thak: that was a very unexpected and uncharacteristic line of play|pg||
nt|psyck: at least we are getting swingly boards now, one way or the other|pg||
nt|thak: any time finesse is going to be advantageous, ruff works equally well|pg||
nt|figo:  that was ' reverse swing ' though |pg||
mb|1N|nt|arunbapat: I do not get why RV did not play CA and back..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N shd hv returned @H instead of @S and RV shd have cashed @Ha|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: same contract here too|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 6@s is a decent one 75%  suppose|pg||
nt|pappoo: 4H is a possible make here|pg||
nt|thak: finesse  could only lose and never gain|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: or even duck the 1st @C arunji|pg||
nt|arunbapat: that would have made situaton clear to N and even to RV|pg||
mb|2H|nt|prasun1966: No slammish hand is noticed as yet  except deal no 5|pg||
nt|subhranp:  this could end in a quiet 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: going to be unlucky for NS|pg||
nt|thak: another slam?|pg||
nt|thak: can make 7 dbl dummy on HT hook and minor suit sqz|pg||
mb|4N|nt|subhranp: should be a comfortable 3nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: opening hand facing opening hand for n/s... will they reach game ?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: e/w not making it easy for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|prasun1966: Now they may bid 6 with 6-5 @S fit  N may proceed further|pg||
nt|arunbapat: May be P has 5431 shape |pg||
nt|figo:  quanti |pg||
nt|psyck: 3 trumps & 7 controls...|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|jain: shd b 1 dwn on the std lead of @C K|pg||
nt|mackulky:  with Railways and DSM already prequalified as the two Semi finalists , they have to find two more Semi finalists from the remaining teams i.e. Manyawar , Texan Aces , Formidables and Poddar Developers|pg||
nt|figo:  will last deal be playing on laltu's mind?|pg||
nt|thak: he'll really need to struggle to mess this one up :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: PLAY GOING ON HOW CAN I TELL?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: nd shd suffer the same fate|pg||
nt|mackulky:  may be unless he takes a trump reduction line but apparantly there is no clue for that |pg||
nt|jain: rana will play heart after winning hoping to ruff the third heart nd also hoping trumps to behave|pg||
nt|jain: usually rana is a very quick player|pg||
pc|c6|nt|prasun1966: Yes it is:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as per one kib state of the match sud stop them from bidding a 75% slam:)|pg||
nt|subhranp:  meanwhile texans have gained 11imps on B49 as IR pair missed the slam in the other room|pg||
nt|figo:  predict at your own risk sandeep :)|pg||
nt|thak: nah, no risk, hand plays itself|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sandipdang:  the problem with aggressive openings is exemplified by this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: ANIL|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfj: jacobus announces they are in the wrong spot|pg||

nt|sandipdang:  that was expensive on rajesh's part|pg||

pc|d4|nt|jain: diff to believe that they cld miss such easy slam|pg||

nt|figo:  arun must be saying sorry to suhas |pg||
nt|psyck: surprised at the play, Arun is normally very good|pg||
nt|thak: perhaps arun happy to settle for -50 given that he doesn't see 4@H being defended..|pg||
nt|figo:  ok friends , gtg now , happy viewing , bye |pg||
nt|nkgupt: ruffing low hardly made any sense:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|subhranp:  5d would have been easier to make|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pappoo: 6S   6Nt can both make here|pg||
nt|psyck: Thx Arvind|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mackulky:  so Manyawar still have some space to make up some|pg||
nt|prasun1966: EW can make 4@H  high-card doesnot permit though|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Difficult for N to enter into here in vulnerable position and would be dengerous also |pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: x by s?not  many's choice for sure|pg||
nt|thak: 6 hands no swing in a row. don't see that every day..|pg||
mb|d|nt|subhranp: after 3 sets, formidables were leading 89-63 |pg||
nt|prasun1966: Great Satya took the right decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|psyck: 4 swingly deals follow though|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp:  that is some aggressive bidding and as the cards are it makes.|pg||
nt|pappoo: will probably go 3NT 4NT and north has to decide whether to go on|pg||
nt|nkgupt: suspect all one way|pg||
nt|psyck: could well be|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  good lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|mackulky:  what will RV play after winning?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: why not jain? what will u bid ?|pg||

nt|thak: here comes first of those|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mackulky:  is there any news on the position of the other match ?|pg||

nt|subhranp:  6s is on|pg||

pc|h6|nt|subhranp:  well if anyone wants to recover then can reach there|pg||
nt|pappoo: other room stopped in 3NT so a likey 13 imp pickup for the texans!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  shd be 12 trks easy|pg||

nt|mackulky:  well this shud be a huge swing as i am told in the other table Texans are in 6@D |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: for the trump lead North shd have long @Hs .. so cross ruff must be safe|pg||
nt|thak: given that sumit and bhabesh are partners majority of the time, and all 4 part of same regular team. It is not surprising that auction was identical|pg||
