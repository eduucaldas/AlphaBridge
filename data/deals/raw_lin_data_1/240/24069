mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Let's see if NS can avoid getting too high. Any slem is very very very poor, despite the 30 HCB in combined hands|pg||

mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|adriaantje: 1@H probably walsh-like|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Not sure if 2D is 4th suit forcing or 2-way CBS. But it is approximately teh same in this auction anyway|pg||
nt|adriaantje: NS shouldn't even be in 5@S|pg||
nt|adriaantje: 4@S is high enough|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: You need to guess spades for 11 tricks|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: or need an defensive error|pg||
nt|adriaantje: well actually you can get 11 tricks while misguessing the @S|pg||
nt|adriaantje: @SAK|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|nt|adriaantje: and play @S|pg||
nt|adriaantje: east has to give you a trick|pg||
nt|niekbrink: missing one Ace and the queen of trumps south will dispointly settle for 5 spades|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Seems like you are right Adriaantje|pg||
nt|pauleger: but you must play W for Jx and not JTx in @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pauleger: not so easy|pg||
pc|d7|nt|niekbrink: What chances do you have when west has JTx of clubs?|pg||

nt|pauleger: that would be @s to the A and a low one to the @sJ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d4|pc|c4|nt|pauleger: but N has 2 potential @c loosers, so he should play @ss on top|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|niekbrink: At the moment you need 52% approximately to qualify for tomorrows final|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pauleger: Playing a small @s is inferior to the @sK. Look at the bidding and the lead: S didn´t lead a @h, so he will have a doubleton @h and singleton @s , maybe a honor. @sK, @s finesse ...|pg||
nt|pauleger: (if needed) and @hs from top|pg||

mb|2H|nt|adriaantje: It's been all day like that|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: Now I agree :)|pg||
