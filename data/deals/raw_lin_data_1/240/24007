nt|andyv:  with partner a passed hand, E can take a few more liberties, but must be aware that his bid prevents the opps from finding their @h fit.|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: HI GM ALL OF U|pg||
nt|henryb:  GM, or here GN|pg||
nt|figo:  thin lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: FORMIDABLE 56 UP|pg||
nt|figo:  a game plus as some would say |pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  The same line up for Manyawar |pg||
nt|henryb:  I'll comment for a while if you would like|pg||
nt|figo:  but not much over 14 boards set |pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|prasun1966: Hi all Welcome Back|pg||
nt|mackulky:  re Hi all and Pramod |pg||
nt|prasun1966: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|figo:  rv and srinivasan are playing here their first event for Texan Aces |pg||
mb|3N|nt|figo:  which they joined just 3 months back |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|figo:  rv tempted to bid on |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhz: GOOD MORNING ALL OF YOU|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|henryb:  A tricky problem for E. I am sure we would all bid 3N, but 4@s is a much better contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzhz: .|pg||
nt|jain: missing akj pd bidding 4d,difficult to stop below game|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mackulky:  mminor part score tussle |pg||
nt|figo:  decl will be pleased |pg||
nt|jain: hmm friendly lead nd made|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  better than friendly - the only lead to allow the contract to make|pg||
nt|jain: fans of texan aces overjoyed for sure:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: TEST|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  I don't know how to get there|pg||
pc|d5|nt|figo:  how many wont lead  SA ? thats a Q worth asking |pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzhz: GOOD MORNING ALL|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Good Morning everybody|pg||
nt|prasun1966: 2@S here is 4-4 minor opening hand |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|henryb:  Now a tricky problem for S.|pg||
nt|prasun1966: ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he might solve it. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Or rather, perhaps he should. He knows declarer has at least three spades, two clubs, and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|henryb:  as winners. So the only hope is that declarer has the stiff @hK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was counting tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|mackulky:  easy 9 tricks for Raju |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|prasun1966: difficult for S to take @SA and Play @HA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  And if declarer has only the stiff @hK. he will have five diamonds, therefore ...|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: PLAY WAS DELAYED DUE TO APEAL|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|pc|dT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  And partner, who did not preempt in first seat has to have a reason|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|prasun1966: After this bidding auction, it was not very clear to S  the exact distribution of E|pg||
nt|jain: for sure at this level we dont expect @S A lead|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|henryb:  What better teason than 5-6 in hearts and clubs|pg||

nt|andyv:  missing a game might be a stretch since W was a passed hand.  I agree that E's hand needed to do something and 1@h was about the best option|pg||
nt|kista:  W may open 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|andyv:  NS must play that 2@s would have been forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  I would be tempted to bid 4@s with the S hand immediately (if it wasn't conventional)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kista:  Manas had a raise to 4 |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  Once W raised @cs, S could expect some ruffing values in dummy so should have risked bidding 4@s|pg||

nt|sandipdang:  with contract right sided 6nt shd roll home always|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|mackulky:  EW can get ypto 4@S |pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|prasun1966: E and W r playing Strong @C  while NS r playing 2/1|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  North is likely to play this in 2N or 3N after opening 2N in fourth seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  After two rounds of @d, he has 3@s, 1@h, 1@d and 1@c|pg||
nt|prasun1966: N will have to believe the @S10 to make this contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  He needs three more tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of these can come from the fourth spade, but he still needs two tricks from somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|mackulky:  both play and defense will be interesting|pg||
nt|mackulky:  but I believe Declerer should prevail in the end|pg||
nt|figo:  E hand better than just a sign off |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mackulky:  hi Pramod|pg||
nt|mackulky:  and all kibitzers|pg||
nt|vugraphzhz: HI|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb:  the only place is hearts, which is possible if the @hK is onside|pg||
nt|prasun1966: Last hand also S led @HQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  but he needs two entries to dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mackulky:  and @C hons placed favourably|pg||
nt|henryb:  And as Prasun said, that means he needs to take the @s finesse also|pg||

nt|jain: 2c p 2d ppp?|pg||
nt|baldjean: 5@c is a good sacrifice here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henryb:  I think it is close between 5@d and 6@d as E over 4@h|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 6@d from E i suppose|pg||
nt|henryb:  Back up, operator|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 45 IMPS diff but not impossible in 14brds|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|figo:  is +140 correct score on last boards ?|pg||
nt|sandipdang:  4 @S shd be -1 on club lead and @D shift|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|nkgupt: is a phantom anyway|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes indeed|pg||
nt|henryb:  but a trick is 5 imps in a close match|pg||
nt|nkgupt: texans fast loosing the ground|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|nt|mackulky:  with no count in Spades tough return for Ajay|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, just aaw for myself that 4@s is down|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mackulky:  third spade|pg||
nt|mackulky:  to kill the winner|pg||
nt|mackulky:  had Raju played a trump at trick 2 and Ajay retun Spade |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|mackulky:  it wud be -2 but no reaon to do it |pg||
nt|sandipdang:  5! also needs accurate defence|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|prasun1966: To take the quick tricks against opps' slam is most common gesture of almost everybody:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Rajesh also did not find the heart play on Bd 57. He gave himself less chance, though, by grabbing the first spade|pg||
nt|nkgupt: this table i thought was much easier after the @c9 discard|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|sandipdang:  5@C|pg||

nt|kista:  Imps trickling in for Texan|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|sunsamvar: bd 84 shd also be a 5/6 imp swing for Texans... they need a big swing soon to make the match exciting|pg||
nt|kista:  Y overstated his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  S should start on @ds before touching trump|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: talking of protecting leads Kista, Railways must be expecting Texans to underbid hands to create swings...|pg||
nt|kista:  A pretty straight contract ...dont expect any swings here|pg||
nt|vugraphzhy: the other match  Formidables -97  to DSM   and  match conceded|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sunsamvar: so shouln't Railways also do the same... tis a game of bluff and counterbluff|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|kista:  Sunil ... That strategy does not work...The chasers have to be agressive|pg||

nt|jain: another flat br|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mackulky:  and Texan are in an early lead|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mackulky:  shud be home with the evn break in @H|pg||

nt|alok_daga: a v heavy 2hrts.14 facing 9 a 3nt .defence will be tested|pg||

pc|dT|nt|mackulky:  now quick claim for 11|pg||
