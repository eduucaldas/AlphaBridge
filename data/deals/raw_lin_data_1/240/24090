nt|adriaantje: Polish pair Kazmierczak - Witkowski leading at youngsters, but they are only 1,5% ahead of numbers 2: Tom van Overbeeke - Ricardo Westerbeek from the Netherlands|pg||
nt|niekbrink: Ricardo westerbeek is the brother of Chris Westerbeek we have at our table here|pg||

nt|niekbrink: They are 3 tops ahead|pg||
nt|niekbrink: That seems like an impossible lot, but after lunch we also thought Klukowski-Zatorski would easily win the youth pairs. Only 1 hour later, Kilani - Lebatteux were leading by 4%... ...|pg||

mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|niekbrink: kibs telling me dat west is squeezed in 2nt after 4 rounds of clubs... I see that|pg||
nt|niekbrink: but leading a club from North is not so obvious|pg||

nt|adriaantje: west turned a good score into a bad score|pg||
nt|niekbrink: bidding isn't over yet|pg||
nt|henryb:  One interesting question is what the difference is between bidding 1@s over the XX and passing, then correcting to @s|pg||
nt|VugraphzJF: difficult for E N screenside|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: East and Norht have the difficult hands this board :)|pg||
