nt|adriaantje: not everyone's style to open the south hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S werealso N-S before. Should they not be E-W now?|pg||
nt|mbruun: Interesting hand, if you place HA with the overcaller there is a kind of safetyplay in clubs to keep East out|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Vejle/microSite/Asp/PairsPlayersResultsDynamic.asp?qtournid=926&qphase=2|pg||
nt|mbruun: With competitive values one might prefer 1 Sp to 1 H after the T/O double|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|pauleger: note that N has all the great cards for his bid to make 4@h makable|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Now we see why Boura bid his suits in the wrong order|pg||
nt|pelu:  for me a perfect hand to bid 3@h over 3@d|pg||
nt|mbruun: South meant is a gameinvitational double. 3 H over 3 D sounds more competing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Better to start with 1@S as Mathias pointed out|pg||
nt|adriaantje: 4@S might also make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Difficult sequence|pg||
nt|mbruun: Heart ruff|pg||
nt|mbruun: 3 D was right in the marbles. Tough bid|pg||
nt|pauleger: the unusual 3@d bid did it´s job|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: South took 4@S as a splinter I guess|pg||

nt|mbruun: If I played with Roland Metusalem Wald I would be heading for slam. With my ordinary partner passing a NV preempt is clearcut|pg||

pc|d5|nt|adriaantje: Leading pair at the moment is Franceschetti - Lhuissier from France|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||

nt|pauleger: he can also play@c10 and later finesse the @c 7 :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I had hoped that you would have corrected the typo, Mathias. Not Metusalem, Jerusalem|pg||
nt|adriaantje: Lietaert - Van den Hove, who we just saw playing at this table, have improved their score hugely and are now ranked 9th|pg||
nt|mbruun: Do you still play 2 Sp as 10½-11 tricks?|pg||
