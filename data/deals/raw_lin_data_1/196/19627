nt|psyck: the preemption seems to have worked other table with some overbidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: for me 4@H seem little stretched|pg||
nt|psyck: it indeed was|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@S is 8-11|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you in croatia Matt?|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is a junior tournament, so expect alot of fireworks here, both pairs are pretty agressive :|pg||
mb|1N|nt|zebutin: and 4+ cards unbalanced (or 5+ balanced)|pg||
nt|minimeck: today is actually my birthday, 26 now too old :x|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!s or minors|nt|zebutin: so Koistinen has maximum for their bidding|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|minimeck: it's ok, time for our young stars for their chance in the spotlight|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: will play 3@h undoubled here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought you might be close to the "edge" |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: this most likely goes 3 or so down, so small pickup for Finland|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is pretty much a cake walk for declarer,  not much to say |pg||
nt|minimeck: While this appears to be a flat four hearts, NS in the open room got a bit carried away, are now rotting in 4@s x , which appears to be 5 or 800|pg||
pc|c4|nt|zebutin: balanced 7points (essentially 6 with Jxx in @D) isn't usually something you want to bid 4with against partners t/o double, even though partner does have short @D...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|MolvaM: hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: hi all|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Hopefully we will get the names up soon|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I mean so we can click on them|pg||
pc|d8|nt|zebutin: at the other table N bid only 2@D at first, and when partner raised to 3@D found more from pre-emptive hand and bid 4@D...|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have opened 3@d too|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks quite hard decision to defende 1 @d .instead of play some @s or nt -contract|pg||

pc|cK|pc|h4|nt|psyck: don't particularly like the @h9 play but N had a tough guess on what to play. Declarer should have probably started @c after winning @hK|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C suit has some chances for defence too... if S ducks couple times with A, might be enough to make Jansons finese @C 10|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ianmcc: pls who is where - the flags are wrong?|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now a 3rd @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I lean back and wait on my @SQ10|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Ruff in hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec says crosruff after 3 rounds of @Hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This defense is interesting and should perhaps make declarer guess spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would a defender give you a ruff and discard?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To protect his Jxxx maybe?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I still think 2 rounds of @h, a @c shift and then the 3rd @h is best|pg||
nt|kemperg: just got the book of Mike Lawrence. conclusion OK|pg||
nt|kemperg: partner gave it fot my bithday, had a meaning i suppose:(|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||

mb|1H!|an|4+!s|nt|penseur9: Hi Markkhu|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt on a @s lead here appears doomed|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Edgettons in the open room are superstars in our part of the world...|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: usually not 6th club in 1nt, but tells strength quite closely, and shape not too much off...|pg||
nt|minimeck: appears they failed to find the club shift on board 21 so first blood to the americans|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|wiki: EW is bidding very differently in open and closed as close open all 8 or more|pg||
nt|zebutin: not even singelton or two|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both ok |pg||
mb|3D|nt|zebutin: Koistinen knows that 16 is max for Nyberg... but must have something good for jump to 3@H in zone|pg||
nt|bebechira: Nabil will play in Veldhoven in the open team... the youngest ever :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: an interesting trend in junior qualifiers recently, going to 10 board round robin / swiss matches, very few boards with a world championship on the line, :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
mb|3S|nt|runnerup: hi Andre'|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They seem to be getting too hugh here|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They can bail out at 4@c & make that|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to stop with 16 opp 8|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: True|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: so well bid on both rooms, might be imp difference for either way, if declarer just takes 6@C+@H+@D+@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|zebutin: or if defender tosses 1 diamond away, declarer fineses and takes 6@C, @S, @H , 3@D|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this 12 board semifinal will play one of the Finnish teams in the 12 board Finals to follow after this.|pg||
nt|zebutin: or declarer can double finese in @D, but I honestly don't see that happening...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he lead kindly but still should fail|pg||
nt|bebechira: not a lot of room to "recover"  if you make a mistake :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: But if they get to game (in clubs) probably the heart lead has been pin pointed now.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: A lot of work to do here, in 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: hard gamble by W|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: This might help|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ianmcc: pls change names - these are last tim's|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|zebutin: after opponents have bid @D as their suit, Nyberg might have void in that, so @D A isnt pulling all the weight it could be...so disciplined pass|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @S return still 3 tricks coming for defence, which would be 7 imps for finland|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will have 10 rounds of Swiss... and then QF,SF and F|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|minimeck: QF and SF 3 16 board segments, with a final of 4 14 board segments and (3rd place playoff of 3 segemnts) at least they went to all day matches for the semis and quarterfinals|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||

pc|s8|nt|runnerup: @h guess needed and done|pg||
pc|h9|nt|minimeck: it is also interesting to note only 27 teams entered the event as opposed to 40 in istanbul, I was somewhat suprised by the decreased attendence given the location in europe|pg||

nt|bebechira: this has to show the depth of our youth |pg||
nt|bebechira: agree Ian...fantastic teams|pg||
nt|bebechira: a lot of superstars in the teams|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 3NT might make here by South, on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: the official event page http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/Opatija11.htm|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|wiki: maybe we can live with these  still 9 deals, sorry|pg||
nt|pelu: yes 1Nt - 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|bebechira: the cheap slam scored 13 for us :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9: a strong @H contract here for EW|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cards lie well for 3NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: not sure if EW have changed their NT ranges, would have expected a 2nt opener from brescoll here, 1@c will work much better :p|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He should play all to make this and will.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|zebutin: E/W got this one cheap, might even make, or @D H lead making comfortably...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt seems like normal spot to be in, might have some difficulties with entries for @C, but when @D 10 drops has always sure entry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might need a good guess  in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you fond of 2 nt with W?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wiki: 6 @C is on and  needs 1/1 clubs  which is odds or @h finesse  also you can try to get cover on @DQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: Juzz has a very good feel at the table.... i think he will make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not - perhaps a discard on @d|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2 aces and a trump|pg||
nt|bebechira: in theory lol|pg||
pc|cA|nt|runnerup: previos hand number 2 both rooms made 4 @s -which should have been beaten -no guess in @h helps if south takes his ace and playes a small @c to his partner to play @s |pg||
nt|penseur9: the lead will decide how many extra tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|ianmcc: this helps. Now the discard a real possibility|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|play4fun55:  still some work to be done|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bebechira: 10 boards matches... not a lot of boards to recover the bad ones :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|zebutin: or without @S lead has always sure entry in @S suit|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wiki: I thin 4 @D is splinter|pg||
nt|wiki: luckily we have very qualified operator|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wiki: well done ladies|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wiki: you have problems only if  clubs are 2 0 with W  East can easily be endplayed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: North recovers nicely. Now -1|pg||
nt|minimeck: that would be my choice yes : )|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|penseur9: looks like +1 at best here|pg||

nt|minimeck: people make fun of meckwells excessive NT (1nt/2nt) also ... so :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h9|pc|c8|nt|sybarra: so we would not make in jrs.  was not my choice (and I do not play a club system) |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|bebechira: more blood coming our way.. the Edgttons signed off in 3s in the open room :(|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bebechira: in brd 23|pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile, south opened 1@h on garbage on this hand and managed to muck it up and keep ew out of game :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wiki: odds are for @C A but but N starts elimination already/ I do not know why|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzmy: sry they are playing 3NT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|play4fun55:  but home sound and safe|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Can still make this|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|minimeck: their agressiveness is paying off thus far|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzhm: For our new spectators this is the first day of Riga Invites tournament Invitational pairs, it is a swiss tournament on IMPs. This is the second table. Have fun watching! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: For more information www.rigainvites.com|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They play a round of 4 deals, so now it is a break time, we will be back shortly|pg||
nt|runnerup: that @d fit 7-3 was found in other table -some help from defended ofcause by double to 3nt -spades badly|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: The players who were sitting NS at this table is a strong Latvian pair. They were 5th in Philadelphia in mixed pairs tournament|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: I think they will turn up again at my table soon|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew are sitting open pairs champions in Eesti from Finland|pg||

nt|minimeck: i should correct my self, not really garbage, an 0-5-4-4 9 count, but. when opening hands like that, have to draw a line somewhere :)|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|mb|p|nt|penseur9: we're back|pg||

mb|2N!|an|ask|nt|zebutin: 4@C most likely Namyats,promising foor hand in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: this deal will extend the lead significantly|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like defence could get 2@S, @C, @D, @H in 5@D, so they might have slipped a little|pg||

mb|3C|an|good hand|nt|ianmcc: 4@h a chance for E/W|pg||

nt|minimeck: with a free 4s from partner?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and never mind the vulnerability |pg||
nt|minimeck: but certainly no clear options here, besides a blast, spec offers 5c?|pg||
mb|3D!|an|ask|nt|wiki: par contract / NS can make 2 @S|pg||
nt|bebechira: ace of clubs lead in the open room.... gave the vikings 12 back :(|pg||

nt|zebutin: foor = good...|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: most likely making 10 tricks after finese of @C|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Oh srry, you are right|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wiki: and D by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: looks standard +1  if @c switch found -or +2 if not|pg||

mb|p|nt|zebutin: Koistinen doesn't see fullgame even against maximum, so passed with decent hand, maybe getting nice penalty score...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this gets him up to 8. Let's see if defence can manage 5|pg||
nt|henryb:  and even then a @d shift will beat it easily|pg||

mb|1C|nt|wiki: two boards here so it will be  time for winning moves I suppose  Paganus is going to have 10 in the last board|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam EW anyone?|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  3 nt has a fighting chance|pg||
mb|d|nt|runnerup: a slam here 3 options -6 @d best|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that should deter them|pg||
nt|petka: a splinter diamonds is nice, but S would rather see a splinter spades :) Still, all those aces and the bonus J and JT are tempting|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very thin game E/W maybe 3NT better|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: right Markku|pg||
nt|zebutin: with 1@S you get to tell 5-5 quite easily|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, a quiet 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard bids anything,  I hit the deck with S |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ianmcc: 3@s is ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: i must say i would blast 4@H with @S hand now...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, not much option with such shape & non reversible values anyway|pg||
nt|zebutin: i think nyberg told 8+ with @C suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|zebutin: with 2@D that is|pg||
nt|petka: scandinavian style that shows extras with diamond splinter. Hard to stop below 5 if this is such a bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Would you raise 2@h to 3 vul, Matt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: looks like 5 imps more so 2 imps still and a nice board coming next|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns in bidding and ew quite lazy|pg||

nt|bebechira: 2???????|pg||

nt|minimeck: opp my p's 14 16 no, but perhaps|pg||
nt|bebechira: i was thinking flat as 620 flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 5 Ok anyway|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  I think they have one loser in every suit in 4h|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  in d even 2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2 in @d?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: now Pete has to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  Shirley, you can't (should not) pass partner in a possible 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Way too high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: West could have the hand he actually has.|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S? - I was just between 2@s and 3@S :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|zebutin: either 5@S or 5@C make, anything over 5@S is little tougher...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wiki: we have lost some specs to spingold  /  why |pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@H = 4@S for me...not 4@H...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|zebutin: just say i had couple @H mixed with my @S suit if partner asks...|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h also ok, helps pd make a choice if opps bid further|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was passing any 2 level bid,  maybe I am the old fogey here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  2 losers in the d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 0 in @s|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  true|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so this is a good contract but finesses don't work|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petka: a popular style is 3C=minimum, 3D=extras with no splinter, 3H=club splinter, 3S=diamond splinter etc|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: yes, you are better positioned after 4@H if opponents bid on|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand opponents know more about your hand, which might affect defence...so everything has upside and downside...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|zebutin: most likely defence will take their 2 @H tricks|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But, maybe Juniors lacking experience get excited when they see a lot of points.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|wiki: 4 @S is not bad contract but...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  You look for a 4-3 major by bidding 2@h over 2@d|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wiki: played by east I think it could be on|pg||
nt|zebutin: and after that declarer just tests spades and clubs and claims|pg||
nt|zebutin: Latvians did well to reach 6@H at deal number 7 on other table too, so no swing for Finland|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|penseur9: this should prove costly for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok sure  and hope he plays 2 @S |pg||
nt|minimeck: we will see how emmons views the south hand, he has been extremely agressive thus far|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  since they use transfers over 1 club, would not a jump to 3 nt by East be a reasonable way of giving W a choice between 3 nt and 4 h ?|pg||
nt|pelu: we are not juniors, Valerie :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Which serves them well in other areas of bidding.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Ni, sigh, unfortunately..|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: No|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|penseur9: easy to get in trouble here|pg||
nt|petka: I am informed that in norway the 2NT response system i outlined is not very popular, so 3S is still an unknown|pg||

mb|2H|nt|penseur9: standings just updated at http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/rig11/invitational/rig11invr.htm|pg||
