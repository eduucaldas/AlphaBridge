mb|p|mb|2C|nt|vugraphzje: east says, he wants to sit on the other side of screen, because they are enjoying themselves :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: east must keep his mouth shut -north warns ann he did|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like N sold major two-suiter and switched E out of the action|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: there is no passes in these games -|pg||
nt|Walddk2: More 4-card majors, and major before minor. Typical Acol style|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: Levy is claiming champagne ! for the trick |pg||
mb|4S|nt|jtr: Hackett-Waterlow actually play a sophisticated system of responses to 1M|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|jtr: But the @h8 allows the @cs to be established|pg||
nt|taliga: The slam is not bad at all, on a @c lead you need the king onside, but on other leads you can try luck in hearts before falling back to the clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: in my system 3NT major with max 1 loser, 8/9 tricks max 1 A|pg||

pc|d4|nt|runnerup: ok-but i dont mean only this board -all boards some 1-2 level too high and if you make 1 less than possible it means 1-3 down all the time|pg||
