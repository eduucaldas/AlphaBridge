nt|Walddk2: If hearts are 5-2, he could have won the first trick and endplayed East with a heart after a few rounds of clubs|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, that would look silly if East started with six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: east putting in the @HJ at trick 1 forced him to commit himself immediately|pg||

nt|athene: actually i am not sure the endplay was so useful anyway because when east cashes the hearts, dummy gets squeezed anyway|pg||

pc|d8|nt|pelu: some work for East, but @SK sh give him the 9. trick|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: so more IMPs for Japan|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So Helmich chose to open his major|pg||
nt|athene: this is the problem with opening these hands 1 of a suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill and I, among others, got a similar problem on a bidding panel|pg||
nt|athene: you are tempted to make another move after a weak-ish response|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  both E and W overbid their hands slightly|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The difference was the 1@S response as opposed to 1@D in the other room|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|andyv:  E hand really isn't that good...only the A@s is a plus...the 5 hearts are not all that useful|pg||
nt|wboer: In the other room Japan is swinging already|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|athene: in the other room east panicked and led away from his @CAQ|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: with 9 toptricks he did risk the contract for an overtrick???|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ricky86: yes, but however was a good contract too|pg||
nt|ricky86: junior bridge :)|pg||
nt|athene: tricky choice of overcall for east|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The weak two in diamonds creates a problem for Lebatteux|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is possible, i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I hate 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Do you all overcall with East's cards?|pg||

nt|kakashi84: yes 3@c isn't a good bid, but he knows his part can't reopening and he thinks he must bid|pg||

pc|d5|nt|wboer: 3NT is high but has play if @d are 3/2|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you can guarantee to keep south off lead, your best chance of a double stop in diamonds is to rise the @DQ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ricky86: a good choice 3nt when you have few points and two balanced hand|pg||

nt|santyclz: Needs to take the @s finesse quickly...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared that Hop had clubs stopped|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: in the other room declarer got a heart lead, played a diamond to the queen himself, and then ran the clubs, and the defenders threw enough things that he felt confident about ...|pg||

pc|c6|nt|ricky86: S didn't guess the 2@c a friendly play :)|pg||

nt|wboer: That is good play. With this @s break he can make it|pg||

nt|santyclz: S had no good choices there.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|nt|wboer: If S played a @s (best) then N still could be endplayed in @d|pg||

mb|3D|nt|athene: i don't think 3@D can achieve so much|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: might just get partner off to the wrong lead against hearts|pg||

nt|rnmalik: same lead in OR.|pg||
nt|athene: in situations like this where it's overwhelmingly likely that the opponents are going to play it, your bids should probably be mostly lead-directing|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|pelu: perfect EW distribution, but with only 8 HCP difficult for W to invite for slam|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is a very strong result for the Dutch|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: There are problem with running score - prob so many try to enter, that the server cant manage|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR board 8 the contract is 6@H.|pg||

mb|p|nt|wboer: my cc is secret|pg||

nt|wboer: There is a loosing option in 6@h after @dA and @d. Enter dummy with @d ruff to play for @hQJx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, we can see that it can be set, but it is very tough at the table|pg||
nt|athene: that's a vital tempo given away|pg||

mb|3S|nt|wboer: I can take a nap now|pg||
nt|athene: even if you play that 2nt is a scramble in that sort of position, you can still use that as "good bad" in the highest-ranking suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: which is very useful|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich has a cleardouble now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wboer: 2NT is limit+ with @s support|pg||
nt|ricky86: construct?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here:)|pg||
nt|athene: because if south had a weak 3@H bid he would bid 2nt scramble and pull whatever his partner bid, to 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Could be a Fantunes gadget, limit with 3|pg||
nt|athene: so a direct 3@H always shows something|pg||

nt|Walddk5: This is a good Dutch result|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NED RUM on a roll against ARG URU in the other semi-final, now 32 up|pg||
nt|athene: wow - this isn't at all the classic french style of pre-emption|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand, |pg||
mb|d|nt|wboer: Open 3NT in wrong hand. Can EW avoid this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and remember the 3NT - no play with @C first or sekund time - price 12 IMP!|pg||
nt|athene: i would have overcalled 3@c with the south cards|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: thin, but i have a 1@C opener, just about, and i am short in hearts so partner might be a bit stuck sometimes|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|wboer: very good result in open room. 4@h is down with a @s ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: snap|pg||
nt|rnmalik: played by W has a chance.|pg||
nt|wboer: No they can't|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: Delle Cave surely doesn't even thought to bid 5@d at board 11|pg||
nt|athene: south now wondering if this is just "equal level conversion" (he passes) or showing a really big hand (he might do something)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: buying it in 4@H in the other room was huge|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk5: Even on a non-spade lead, 4@H was a lucky make|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|h3|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

nt|andyv:  on this hand, 5@d was cold as the @s ruff by defense would have been with a natural trump trick.|pg||
nt|wboer: France scored 6 imp's on board 28 when E psyched 4@h after 3@s opening from partner. Nice!|pg||

nt|rnmalik: too good, can make sitting up here:)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|wboer: If you play like that then you have a sprained neck after a match because of peaking into opp cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wboer: E should play @da and @dq and west will make @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: This hand is probably too good for a 20-21 2NT. Let me ask KnR|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|wboer: EW bid good and agressive again. 4@h makes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: double swing. |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: not a very good hand there - you know partner will respond in spades and you will have to rebid a mildly deceitful 1nt|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ricky86: swing for france at board 12. not perfect italy's bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  south might have bid 2@h at first chance|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 23.00   http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=xx+AQJ+AK9xx+AK10|pg||
nt|wboer: very good team (bid) performance from the Dutchies in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|athene: was 2@C two-way checkback?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hmmm indeed|pg||
nt|kakashi84: what is it?|pg||
nt|athene: forcing 2@D, and then 2@S was natural and invitational?|pg||
nt|athene: lets north invite and stop at a nice safe level - or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 2@S was invitational with 5 usually|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ricky86: here japan may gain some imps|pg||
nt|athene: south decided his partner didn't want to play a 5-1 fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north then decided HIS partner didn't want to play a 5-1 fit, either|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has a loser in each suit and needs to be wary of losing 2@cs|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|d7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: you have to try to set up the spades and give the defence a dilemma|pg||
nt|athene: if they force dummy in clubs to kill any chance of cashing spades, you might get a bit of a crossruff|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  W's job is to keep declarer off dummy|pg||
nt|athene: @HK now is one option|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h3|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||

mb|5D|nt|andyv:  almost automatic 5@d for N|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ricky86: ty all|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rnmalik: @S finesse was on, key to making 4@H.|pg||
nt|athene: a very common dilemma in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: should east double 5@D?|pg||
nt|athene: does this say "i don't want to go to 5@S?" or "i actually have good defence to diamonds"|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pelu: hi all - and once Roland and I agreed :) - see to later or tomorrow|pg||
nt|wboer: Good comeback from japan. Exiting last set in an hour.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wboer: 2@c is don't. 2@h = natural|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west should bid 4@H to involve his pardy over 5@D, but i guess the fit showing jump is supposed to show east's hand precisely so west is in control anyway|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: and should not be trying to involve his partner any more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ricky86: flat hand here|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will need little encouragement to bid 4...the 9@s is a huge card|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: north automatically plays a biggish trump spot (the @D7) to dummy's king|pg||
nt|athene: just in case he wants to lead to the 6 for an extra dummy entry later|pg||
nt|athene: this is really "declarer play auto pilot" for any experienced player|pg||
nt|athene: sure, he has two small diamonds in hand so he might not have needed to, this time - but that is not the point|pg||
nt|athene: in this sort of situation you reach for a "middling" card without thinking|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk5: Bye for now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ricky86: bad playin by declarer. 9 of @s was his salvation|pg||
