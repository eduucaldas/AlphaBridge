nt|Walddk2: W had an interesing hand this morning, when a French player psyched 4@H over his partner's 3@S pre-empt. He could have been kept to one trick (@HA), but he got two. However, 400 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was cheap against 650 in the other direction. Yes, in 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South had responded 1@D, which seems better than 1NT, North would not have led a club if he ended on lead.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A double of 4@H should be for penalties in that auction. You have 4NT for the minors.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The rest was silence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S would be 500 or 800, not sure. Do you remember, Wubbo?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@SX would have gone for 500. Declarer had 6 trump tricks and @HA|pg||
nt|wboer: This hand is more excitement|pg||
nt|rensph: 6@C for NS here, but 6@D looks like an excellent save|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@S much better than some artificial bid such as 2@C, when you have such a shape.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hereis another 2@H overcall I don't like|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better than the previous one.|pg||
nt|wboer: Save is good, but W with 2 aces won't do that. maybe E if they find there @d-fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I prefer 2@S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: By West I mean|pg||
nt|wboer: Strong 2@s opening makes it easier for partner that slam is possible|pg||
nt|wboer: I meant by S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but who plays that nowadays?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Acolites?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: I thougt Michaels cue bid is 5/5|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rensph: It's pointed out by a spec that 6@S is also on - unless W decides to lead a club|pg||
nt|brolucius: South will now bear in mind that North could not raise to 2@S. |pg||
nt|brolucius: North had enough to bid 5@C instead, it seems. His partner's bidding was very strong.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|wboer: Advantage of strong two is that is more preemptive|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@S is wild, really. Partner might have nothing. He should at most have made a try.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wboer: Gambling 6@s by S. he almost opened 6@s. Sure @c lead is down but not to find|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obvious that South has a void heart now, of course.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might have continued with @SJ now, if he held it. A slight inference that East has that card.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|brolucius: If South had bid only 5@S, it would be clear for North to bid 6@S when holding the @CK and some sort of spade support.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|andyv:  this can make 3NT EW|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: this slæam is better :)|pg||

nt|athene: 6@C for NS - will EW sac with two aces?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ricky86: of course :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showing hearts i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: and that will not delight south|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think i would want to stress the hearts with north|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: is 4@H now a cue bid or re-transfer?|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 5@s-4+ in a minor 5-10hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is practical bridge, I'm all for that|pg||
nt|athene: he has more a balanced hand with scattered strength, than a heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: but i imagine 1nt was not available (probably showed clubs)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: raising clubs might work well now|pg||
nt|athene: people rarely do that, though, in this day and age|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ricky86: maybe re transfer|pg||
nt|athene: :(|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will NOT cover @D10|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east thinking about a diamond sac?|pg||

nt|ricky86: 5@h?|pg||
nt|wboer: Good lead. @cK and @s switch is diff for decl|pg||
nt|athene: takes a club lead to beat 6@S i guess?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: This is the last round in the Swiss - 8 best to KO - Japan no 7 with 152 and Australia 1 + 2 + France No 8 with 145|pg||
nt|athene: stops declarer cashing one spade then finessing|pg||
nt|athene: because you don't have the entry to dummy when you need it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: If Poulat has one more to play, diamonds are 4-3 and no worries|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: There is a case for passing at these colours|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rensph: board was more interesting at the other table|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: North as hoping that partner held 5 diamonds. Otherwise he might as well leave it in 2NT. When you raise the level, you have to take two tricks more to benefit (as Reese used to ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think I would have passed 2S. If partner has enough for 3NT to make, you will likely get 200-300 against 2@S. However, it hurts to pass a 19 count|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: 2NT seems OK, as does a pass. Whether East should have doubled 3@D is another question.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting question for a bidding panel|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|brolucius: Unlikely that N/S have anywhere to run, so I think double is right on the East cards.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|rnmalik: no comments please.:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: the 5 IMP - in B2 EW stopped in 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess he was playing for e to be 5/5 in the blacks.|pg||
nt|athene: now if it goes 1@S - 1NT from EW, south can't really double, as that is t/o of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@c = min, 5@D = 1/4, 5@H = 0/3, 5@s = 2+@sq + tx Wubbo|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ricky86: ty :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: but the @dQ holds the trick so east had the @dK|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will pass and Lebatteux can't really bid again|pg||
nt|athene: north can bid 2@D now |pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2@D or 2NT in S being non-vul or pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wecan see that 2NT is makeable, but there is a risk that declarer goes wrong|pg||

nt|wboer: some partnerships play 2NT as good/bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has to guess which finesse to take, and if he chooses spades, he must guess who has A and Q|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: i think this is a bit of a sucker double from south in fact|pg||
nt|athene: north clearly has a hand too weak to raise diamonds over 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: and that is a very weak hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|athene: say, 2 points or so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you might well beat 2nt|pg||

pc|dA|nt|wboer: 2NT in S for the minors was not poss, because west opened 1@c|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If hearts are 5-2, he could have won the first trick and endplayed East with a heart after a few rounds of clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, that would look silly if East started with six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: east putting in the @HJ at trick 1 forced him to commit himself immediately|pg||

nt|Walddk2: My misguesses never gain IMPs. Hop's do|pg||
nt|athene: north refused to raise clubs in the other room as well on board 2 :(|pg||
nt|athene: so they play 6@S rather than 6@C :(|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ricky86: 5 imps to japan|pg||
nt|athene: actually i am not sure the endplay was so useful anyway because when east cashes the hearts, dummy gets squeezed anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so i think it was just a case of guessing spades|pg||

nt|athene: if EW stagger into 4@S, will south try another double?|pg||
nt|athene: you might, if they have had an invitational sequence where west showed hearts|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|wboer: 4@h is a nice contract. The breaks are less nice|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: 2@H too sound in my book. He would also bid 2@H with a 3442 shape and the hand he has is much better than that|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||

nt|brolucius: raise on three trumps might be more nervous of rebidding just 2@H on the North cards.|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: and not Ws style :)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 3@C is the straightforward call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3-level overcall on AJ9xx is againt my religion|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes 3@c isn't a good bid, but he knows his part can't reopening and he thinks he must bid|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wondering about the likelihood of north having @DJ10?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: With 1 zillion entries it seems strange that Kido does not lead a club|pg||
nt|wboer: still time to switch for defence|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@c is a big bid for that hand.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wboer: 3NT is high but has play if @d are 3/2|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you can guarantee to keep south off lead, your best chance of a double stop in diamonds is to rise the @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to cut down on ruffs against the likely 44 fit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ricky86: a good choice 3nt when you have few points and two balanced hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N has a chance...after 4 rounds of @hs, W will have to be passive|pg||

nt|santyclz: Needs to take the @s finesse quickly...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared that Hop had clubs stopped|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: in the other room declarer got a heart lead, played a diamond to the queen himself, and then ran the clubs, and the defenders threw enough things that he felt confident about ...|pg||
nt|athene: trying a small spade for some overtricks|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong - @C would defeat|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|ricky86: S didn't guess the 2@c a friendly play :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's play of A@c was predicated on the need for him to run 9 tricks immediately|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: now West will win on a endplay|pg||
nt|wboer: That is good play. With this @s break he can make it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ruffing declarer's loser with a natural trump trick.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S had no good choices there.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|wboer: If S played a @s (best) then N still could be endplayed in @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's so easy for us when we can see that there was no danger in this contract|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 (std) bit costly sometimes|pg||
nt|athene: upside down carding is just better|pg||
nt|athene: if you have 10x playing std you are better off just not giving count, most of the time; even high from 9x can be costly quite often|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  he hoped to pick up the @s suit, + 3 @d and A@c for his game|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: yes|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ricky86: friendly def here, but well played by declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: @SK the 7. trick - could S have signal better?|pg||
nt|athene: with the cards as they are here, you duck in diamonds|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Only chance for North is to unblock @HK when the ace is cashed; no luck there|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||

mb|3C|nt|wboer: they are young and like to bid (and play)|pg||

nt|wboer: Disadvantage is the shape. It can be 4/4, 5/4 or 4/5. partner doesn't know what to do.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dont is playable, as opposed to Capp when you can't ask for the longer major when partner bids 2@D. You need 2@Cto show the majors, so Dont is no better with respect to that ...|pg||

mb|2H|nt|athene: i don't think 3@D can achieve so much|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@S now - as in OR|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his side has slightly more than half the deck|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if partner has a heart stack there could be a number on offer|pg||

nt|rnmalik: same lead in OR.|pg||
nt|athene: in situations like this where it's overwhelmingly likely that the opponents are going to play it, your bids should probably be mostly lead-directing|pg||

pc|s2|nt|athene: ok, he feels that south bidding spades or diamonds is too likely, and too likely to be wrong|pg||

nt|brolucius: East knows that West is very short in spades (1 at most), so 5@C is definitely in his sights.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2NT and perhaps 3@D after that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is a sign-off|pg||
nt|athene: that's fine provided 3@D is known to be a sign-off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If West had extras, he would raise to 3NT and not show his 5th diamond|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ricky86: now another good game, 3nt are unbeatable|pg||
nt|wboer: again a board that won't be published in the bulletin|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: or if he has a really strong 5-5 he can bid 3@C or something|pg||
nt|athene: but he can't be that strong after only 2@D |pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: looks as though it's time for east to bid 5@C|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  W needs to preserve the K@h in dummy.  He should tackle the @s suit now|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: not sure 2@H over 2@D in the other room was a very good bid|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They are working hard to get many and good junior players all over the world. In Europe, the Netherlands, Poland and France are the strongest youth nations (then add Israel, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: playing in European events). No, I don't want to discuss politics, just stating a fact|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: yes, and it would have allowed north to lead a LOW spade against 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: and so avoid making the @S98xxx into a stopper|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: if north had been able to show the 5-5 (ghestem, say) then EW might have ended up defending|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, it's possible e-w will be in 3nt at the other table. they do have a @S stopper, but the defence has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess if anyone is playing ghestem this match it will be france :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: There is some truth in the notion that juniors can make any board exciting.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: A response such as 3NT is so space-consuming that it makes sense for it to have a very precise meaning.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is this what you call a 'pudding raise' in the UK?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some say 13-15 points and 3-3-3-4 shape (4 cards not in the opener's suit, probably not in the other major either).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or is that 4333?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A pudding raise contains four trumps (because Acol plays 4-card major openings).|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am dying to know how 'pudding' came into the frame|pg||

mb|2C|nt|wboer: @d ruff will beat !3s on a ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: 3@s is delicate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good spot reached by France in the other room|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: 5@C/5@D will cost 300 against 4 major, but with all green u normal not go for this save - but sometimes u can push opp to 5-level!!|pg||
nt|pelu: both Ns broke Rolands rule No 1 : no weak to with 2 Aces :)|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows a balanced hand south may go for the nine-trick game|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would, with 4333 and strength in all side suits|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk5: Indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: I'd rather open 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D looks like an underbid if it isn't forcing|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: The trick is to avoid 3NT, and they did in both rooms. Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by both sides|pg||
nt|andyv:  E seems to have no problem in bidding with marginal hands|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@c = Gazzili. 2@d = 8+ hcp, 2@s = 5@h + 4@s 18+|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt could be a good hand, though, south might feel obliged to show the support in case they have slam|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 1nt with north, certainly|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: as u understand, I dont agree with him :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Ricardo and Wubbo would u open 1@h or 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 3NT, have to bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: 6@c is a beauty, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|athene: another trick is to avoid 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why the double I wonder. He knows he will be on lead himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: 4NT = NF, kanti|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed yes. with QJ@H falling.|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt - 3nt is a reasonable auction i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: quantitative|pg||
nt|athene: against diamonds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ah sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I would rather be in 3nt than 4@S here, but they should make it either way|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|wboer: You have 11 toptricks with @c not 5/1. Enough entries to develop 5th @h or @dA good|pg||
nt|wboer: Well bid again by EW|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wboer: I would open 1@h|pg||
nt|ricky86: i play 2@h 10-12 with 6 cards, but here i think is weak.. i don't agree|pg||
nt|ricky86: i would open 1 @h|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you have Ax of trumps you have to jump in with the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|athene: so as not to get endplayed later|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: but i think west should be able to see that is not the issue on this hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: made easy.:)|pg||
nt|athene: not clear to run this because if you lose to west's queen, you just incurred an extra loser and you don't have anything so useful to throw on dummy's clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: even if he does, it's only an imp :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|pelu: and give N @Hj 10 and not the Q would u still open 1@h|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only complaint I have regarding these youngsters is that they double (lead-directing) way too much. Most of the time it helps the opponents more than partner|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West has to double when he is afraid of South's bid being passed out. So, a double is assumed initially to be showing spade shortage.  |pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: There are problem with running score - prob so many try to enter, that the server cant manage|pg||

nt|athene: that's a vital tempo given away|pg||

nt|athene: since the @HK is overwhelmingly likely to be in dummy|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ricky86: Donati-Percario play a very good bridge for their age. I should mention that Donati is 13 yo and Percario is 16 yo :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East had @CJ instead of the 10, 4@S can be defeated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as it is, 5@C is a correct save|pg||
nt|athene: NS do well to "take the money" here since pressing on to 5@S would lead to a negative score|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would go for 2nt i think|pg||
nt|bobholl: now you misdescribe you hand always :)|pg||

mb|3H|nt|wboer: What should N bid? Pass is ok imo|pg||
nt|athene: you might not be too happy taking a probable 500 against your vul game, but you don't want to go for "650 or maybe -100" instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: strange but winning because @dA is wrong. Do they play a strong @c system?|pg||
nt|pelu: they prob play 2@S contructiv and he didnt like to bid 1NF (forsing - semiforcing)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: has no choice.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a very pure hand here and imagines short spades with partner so will sac i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: also 5@C takes blackwood away from north|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: because it uses up SO much room|pg||
nt|athene: when the auction gets icky like this, it's a good idea to favour the cheaper bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: but Australia need 19-11 to pass Japan|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, surprised|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|warrens:  the other option is 2nt, which is tough on Jxx.  I actually don't like 1@H very much, unless playing a strong club.|pg||
nt|bobholl: which is 2NT but with Jxx i can't like that too :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: 2NT was a bit of a gamble, but any other bid could go wrong too on that hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Why not 3@D? Partner has forced you to the 3-level if you can't stop diamonds and bid notrump. Consequently, 3@D should just be a default bid, or waiting if you like|pg||

nt|brolucius: In that case it would have been obvious for the two Easts to have bid it here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2@S is game-forcing, it is bridge logic that 3@D has that meaning. If it is not, then it seems 3@D should show extra strength. I don;t see how you can decide whether to bid game ...|pg||

nt|wboer: Roland and Peter are right. E thought he would get to high when answering 2@s|pg||
nt|wboer: nice clow contract in open by japan|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: 4@S not so bad here but hard to find with two balanced hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: interesting hand now|pg||
nt|athene: west will super-accept spades i guess despite nasty 4333|pg||
nt|athene: you have to do something with 17 count and 4 trumps don't you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 17 with 4 is enough|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: EW won't be nearly sure enough that 4@H is making|pg||
nt|athene: even if it gets bid, which is not certain|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 3@H in the other room was showing a good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wubbo; 2Nt?|pg||
nt|athene: then east will bash the game in|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wboer: I can take a nap now|pg||
nt|athene: even if you play that 2nt is a scramble in that sort of position, you can still use that as "good bad" in the highest-ranking suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: which is very useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and down they will go :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Helmich has a cleardouble now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4333 hands really ARE that evil|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: 2NT is limit+ with @s support|pg||
nt|ricky86: construct?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here:)|pg||
nt|athene: because if south had a weak 3@H bid he would bid 2nt scramble and pull whatever his partner bid, to 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Could be a Fantunes gadget, limit with 3|pg||
nt|athene: so a direct 3@H always shows something|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|ricky86: bad choice bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d bit a bit over the top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that nowadays penalty doubles do not exist below 7@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quite sure no @C lead and @S guess will let it make|pg||
nt|athene: yeah you can get two clubs away on the hearts - but why should you play the spades right?|pg||
nt|bobholl: or no @C switch now |pg||
pc|d2|nt|wboer: Yes limit with 3 @s|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 3@S pretty much forces NS into 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything is for take-out. The doubles just have various names, but 'penalty' is not among them|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer doesn't have easy communication, but he can make this if S ducks|pg||
nt|athene: even if south flies the ace, it's not obvious to play a club|pg||
nt|athene: could look very silly a lot of the time |pg||
nt|warrens:  no, but another @D is sufficient|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer has the ace|pg||
nt|athene: yes, ace and diamond works ok|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: limit I can for sure see - and only 3 card @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  A of @D and a @H is dangerous for the defense|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: yes - an "optional" double these days means "you can pull it to your suit, or to my suit" :)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|athene: should get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|athene: he knows west has a lot more diamonds than east|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|warrens:  Now, declarer has to pitch 2 @C's and then play a @C to dummy |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, no miracles|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: is the @D8 discouraging in diamonds?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: west certainly doesn't want a diamond lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: but the convention work better when opening = 14+|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: he can count declarer for only 4 trumps, 3 clubs and the spade|pg||
nt|athene: so he will have to develop diamonds himself|pg||
nt|athene: yes he needed the club as a scissors coup|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: no need for the defence to get busy in that suit|pg||
nt|athene: to prevent south cashing the @DA and getting a ruff|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: asking too much|pg||

mc|9|nt|Walddk5: We are all juniors in your hearts, Peter|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, it's what he would do if he thought he needed to start trumps from dummy (but there's no compelling reason to do that)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Excellent psyche if it is|pg||
nt|bobholl: the old problem with 15-17 and 5 high :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  this time only one suit for slam|pg||
nt|pelu: our friend from japan could jump to 3@H in OR|pg||

nt|ricky86: the problems of these hands is stay awake :)|pg||
nt|pelu: here 2@S ask: do u have a opening hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You would also bid 2@H with one spade more and one diamond less|pg||
nt|wboer: In 6@s S has a natural @cQ lead for 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: not sure about "excellent", but "successful" it certainly is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is too funny for words if it is true|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk5: and this West hand is considerably better|pg||
nt|athene: the italians do prefer opening the major on these|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't know why they hate 1nt so much|pg||
mb|2D|nt|wboer: exactly. Therefore this 2@s relay|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 6+ suit GF. 3NT = serious slamtry|pg||
nt|kakashi84: it's funny|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: guess they play 12-16 rebid otherwise i don't understand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: they use gazzilli to solve some of the problems after 1M - 1NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, it's a partnership agreement issue|pg||
nt|athene: but those are not problems that you need in the first place :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|warrens:  so,did this sequence show an invitational hand by S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: many flat bords here in 2. segment - in the other 3 matches max swing is 7 IMP|pg||
nt|wboer: I don't know if this is a good convention. You are good in the slamzone, but you tell much to defenders if you are in the limitzone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Yes, but I think you need it if you allow 3-card raises|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I do with a 5431 hand for example|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: next please.|pg||
nt|athene: i am assuming this was a 2-way checkback auction|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like a reasonable way to overcome the problem|pg||

nt|bobholl: despite 26 points not so easy :)|pg||
nt|athene: @H10 comes down|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|wboer: 4NT = optional Blackwood. So 5@c=min, 5@d = 1/4, 5@h= 0/3, 5@s= 2 no @sQ, 5NT= 2 with @sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 8 :)|pg||

nt|kakashi84: -9 possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah, he has 2 tricks already, but was indeed possible|pg||
nt|athene: it's still not that huge a gain, but worth a lot psychologically|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: but still - if east leads a spade after the @HK|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|pelu: 3 card raise for me only if i dont have a better bid - with Hx in @S and 3 card @H I bid 1NT every time|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|warrens:  if W sticks in the 8 now, he can get endplayed |pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|Walddk5: What do you bid with   x  Axx  AQJ10x  xxxx|pg||
nt|wboer: True, you should, but leading for opp is easier now.|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: lead the @DQ was better|pg||
nt|athene: more likely to smoke out the king|pg||
nt|athene: if east doesn't cover the jack that doesn't mean much|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|warrens:  but the finesse is also reasonable, since now W has to cash out to prevent overtricks|pg||

mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some players are reluctant to raise to 2@S when they do not hold a good spade honour. That is not right. The raise will take space away from the other side and is best made ...|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|wboer: In the closed room no 1@s overcall. Style issue. I would overcall.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand, |pg||
nt|athene: another 1nt opener for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: Open 3NT in wrong hand. Can EW avoid this?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: and remember the 3NT - no play with @C first or sekund time - price 12 IMP!|pg||
nt|athene: i would have overcalled 3@c with the south cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: thin, but i have a 1@C opener, just about, and i am short in hearts so partner might be a bit stuck sometimes|pg||

mb|p|nt|ricky86: Delle Cave surely doesn't even thought to bid 5@d at board 11|pg||
nt|athene: south now wondering if this is just "equal level conversion" (he passes) or showing a really big hand (he might do something)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: buying it in 4@H in the other room was huge|pg||
nt|athene: but i would not bother with stayman with the east hand, probably - i would just bid 3nt|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: i like auctions that go 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: but than you get a @H lead :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, this sequence told the world that west has 4 spades and east has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt - 3nt, that's the way to go|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk5: Even on a non-spade lead, 4@H was a lucky make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: south was a bit wet there, i think - pass first time, give pd a single raise and then subside?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|Walddk5: Needed diamonds to come in for 1 loser|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so sometimes the lead in your major was actually better for the defence|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|wboer: E can lead a @c and then you have 10 tricks with the nice @d break|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why not 4@S and @D ace. A possibility.|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|athene: Stayman.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rensph: indeed. I'm just wondering why 3@H was explained as 4ccrd @S then.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But a Dutch kibitzer was just explaining to me that 3@H showed 4 spades.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rensph: Have the 1NT opener reverse his majors sounds odd.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: Oh right - that isn't the way I thought that convention worked.|pg||

nt|rensph: I recall a board from the White House Juniors tournament last year where a 4@D preempt in this situation ended in -2300.|pg||
nt|wboer: I checked the system of EW after 1NT. 1NT-3@d-3@h (relay)- 3NT is pass or correct with exactly 4@h|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|rnmalik: too good, can make sitting up here:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wboer: If you play like that then you have a sprained neck after a match because of peaking into opp cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: the dutch gaining heavily on the 3NT game here (they reached 4@H)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wboer: E should play @da and @dq and west will make @c|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk5: This hand is probably too good for a 20-21 2NT. Let me ask KnR|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: yes, the 2nt rebid worked out better|pg||
nt|bobholl: time for beer convention (3NT showing 5@S and 4@H ?) called when forgetting it you have to buy a beer)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: we have to counter the "i am at favourable" convention from east, first|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D is quite a bid|pg||
nt|athene: many would content themselves with 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: EW bid good and agressive again. 4@h makes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: double swing. |pg||
nt|athene: 4@H looks normal with north|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|athene: not a very good hand there - you know partner will respond in spades and you will have to rebid a mildly deceitful 1nt|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ricky86: swing for france at board 12. not perfect italy's bid|pg||
nt|athene: but people do take advantage of that at this vulnerability|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|athene: was 2@C two-way checkback?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hmmm indeed|pg||
nt|kakashi84: what is it?|pg||
nt|athene: forcing 2@D, and then 2@S was natural and invitational?|pg||
nt|athene: lets north invite and stop at a nice safe level - or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 2@S was invitational with 5 usually|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 trick away :(|pg||
nt|athene: yeah|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ricky86: here japan may gain some imps|pg||
nt|athene: south decided his partner didn't want to play a 5-1 fit|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|athene: north then decided HIS partner didn't want to play a 5-1 fit, either|pg||
nt|athene: south does not imagine his partner has 9 hcp in diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: 14 imps as it is to NED J.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: so he puts him with more outside, reasonably enough|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  N has a loser in each suit and needs to be wary of losing 2@cs|pg||
nt|athene: ruffing spade finesse for the diamond loser, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure you should not get this right|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry the net:)|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|athene: north really can't have long diamonds can he?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: so he has to have very good ones|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s5|nt|athene: you have to try to set up the spades and give the defence a dilemma|pg||
nt|athene: if they force dummy in clubs to kill any chance of cashing spades, you might get a bit of a crossruff|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  W's job is to keep declarer off dummy|pg||

nt|brolucius: So, 4@H is beaten by the bad trump break, which is reason 63 (out of 101) why bidding 4@D is a bit of a gamble on the East cards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: Decl was not playing for the the @d 7/1, as I can imagine|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: also thanks to our commentators, David, Wubbo and Rens|pg||

mb|1C|nt|rnmalik: @S finesse was on, key to making 4@H.|pg||
nt|athene: a very common dilemma in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: should east double 5@D?|pg||
nt|athene: does this say "i don't want to go to 5@S?" or "i actually have good defence to diamonds"|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: hi all - and once Roland and I agreed :) - see to later or tomorrow|pg||
nt|wboer: Good comeback from japan. Exiting last set in an hour.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wboer: 2@c is don't. 2@h = natural|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west should bid 4@H to involve his pardy over 5@D, but i guess the fit showing jump is supposed to show east's hand precisely so west is in control anyway|pg||
nt|athene: many would raise to 2@S with the south hand, not promising a huge hand|pg||
nt|athene: just a courtesy raise|pg||
nt|athene: others say you need quite a few extras for it|pg||
nt|athene: the trend is to raise more|pg||
nt|athene: which i think is right|pg||
nt|athene: it just feels wrong to pass there after partner bid a free 1@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|athene: and should not be trying to involve his partner any more|pg||
nt|athene: wow, very passive from west|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|ricky86: flat hand here|pg||

nt|wboer: Tomorrow the semi final. I hope you join us again. I will, for sure. Thank you all and bye.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: north automatically plays a biggish trump spot (the @D7) to dummy's king|pg||
nt|athene: just in case he wants to lead to the 6 for an extra dummy entry later|pg||
nt|athene: this is really "declarer play auto pilot" for any experienced player|pg||
nt|athene: sure, he has two small diamonds in hand so he might not have needed to, this time - but that is not the point|pg||
nt|athene: in this sort of situation you reach for a "middling" card without thinking|pg||
