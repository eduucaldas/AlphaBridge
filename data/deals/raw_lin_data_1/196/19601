nt|peachy: Lively looking hand to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||

nt|jcwla: If this auction is to make any sense?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or do we just have it all wrong?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: Routine 4@S for NS.|pg||
nt|panosk: double is support i guess meaning 3hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with all bidding, a good stop, looks like just a make|pg||

nt|andyv:  for many years, 2/1 players played 3@h as 5-5 invite and 3@s as 5-5 GF.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: friendly lie for 3N NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: intersting that 3N failed less than 3@C there|pg||
nt|blewah: hi Ian|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: We have different definitions of "just barely there."|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  E may just bid game here|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D seem plausible here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  and S will have hard time ignoring the 6 card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kemperg: wise to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...500-800 certainly possible in 5@c|pg||

nt|loe48: Hi Dennis welcome :)|pg||
nt|panosk: even 7 @D is makeable as card lie but i doubt they will get there|pg||
mb|3S|nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: last set was 44-39 heaps of imps traded|pg||
mb|r|nt|jcwla: K&R has that last S hand at a generous 8.6: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ83+Q2+873+Q973 |pg||

nt|ianmcc: hi aria|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks OK|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|kiwibridge: a decent save non-vul here as 4@H easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: redouble showing 1st round control in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: at these colours asking for too much. pass the right decision.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice auction|pg||
nt|kerasidis: very usufull....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately game not reached CR|pg||
nt|panosk: gd lead to try to defeat, spade is no use since auction revealed singleton opposite A|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|panosk: even possible void (3@S)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|blewah: from the 3@h response to 2@s I think NS play 2/1|pg||

nt|blewah: so 15-17NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi aria|pg||
nt|blewah: Hi Andy|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes, bd 1 is a push, CR playing same boards as us|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: instead of gaining the sacrifice loses 7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi rashed|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: N doubled 5@H so defence was easy in 6@S in closed room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcwla: A nice third-seat weak 2 if available.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  trick is for NS to stay low |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: if S bids his hearts.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ianmcc: partial for N/S but they could get higher|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c bergen I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@D misguided in third seat.  It's their hand - put some pressure on.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now, let's talk about this double -- or the lack of a double by the N hand in similar situations.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats what i call trump support |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and does, finally a 10 point opener gets a good result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beegen raise I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bergen|pg||
mb|2S|nt|blewah: and S decided he likes his hand a lot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C was bergen as I look at it and S upgraded his hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need this trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D Ace and @H back:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the defense should be pretty easy as long as W doesn't get overly anxious and cashes out early|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: looks like -1 again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep   could be -2 if they can get second ruff |pg||
nt|panosk: @D2 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd ruff = the same 2 trump tricks he started with?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: You and your favorite partner need to have agreement on what it means: does it ask for a @D lead (so that if you don't double you are suggesting a different lead) or does it say "I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: have a 2@D rebid that they stole"?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jcwla: I prefer the latter meaning and trust that pd will lead my suit in the absence of a clearly better alternative; however, I do have some pds who require the double if I want the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: lead of that suit.|pg||
nt|peachy: Again, remembering Precision context|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: bad break in trumps 4@H had no chance gd game though|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D isnt simple support in @D must be 2way checkback with game forc hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  at 50 a pop, down 1 or 2 shouldn't make much difference as it's almost impossible to stop in 2@s or 2@h with the NS hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: probably another push |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|panosk: for more info check this link http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TwoWayCheckback.html|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: good unblock N after his good lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: now 2@H and still a @D to lose|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|jcwla: Right - here, it is clearly showing @D length.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: confirmed by a spec, thx|pg||
nt|peachy: I really do not have any first hand knowledge, but looks like Precision|pg||

nt|loe48: many use 2nt as good raise in this pos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Carl|pg||
nt|loe48: invite + in spade|pg||
nt|panosk: with the 4@S bid that is, agree with Denni|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|d2|nt|panosk: no |pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: I was kind enough not to say anything about hte 1NT last hand, but the words are just bubbling on my tongue|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is just cruising for a bruising here.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H=4 card support good hand |pg||

nt|sybarra: with nothing to go on |pg||
nt|sharkey: West made slam try in @D but E turned it down.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: do tell Gary |pg||

nt|panosk: ah yes and only played with people who aplied his rule too|pg||

pc|h8|nt|kemperg: copipying a terrible bid:(|pg||
nt|sybarra: stuffed N in |pg||

nt|sybarra: LOL  :) |pg||
nt|panosk: i mean if you get there you will have to make :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Playing highest @S to prevent short honors from taking tricks to extent possible and draw trumps like so.|pg||
nt|kemperg: destroyd the entrys for double hook in @D, 11 instead of 12 tricks|pg||

nt|peachy: West at the crossroads, what to do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, in an ugly spot|pg||
nt|peachy: he cant leave it in|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S the least of evils|pg||

nt|sharkey: not sure what West has shown...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: cant be S playing 2 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: a transfer interference? |pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: suppose so|pg||

nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: E had a good rebid on 1major|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panosk: they might even have 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h vs 4@s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: Yes, far more worthy of a bid than the 1@D S egested on 1.|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl could be showing majors, a common def to strong C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same story can be repeated in CR:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|kiwibridge: 7 imps quite a cruel penalty really|pg||

nt|blewah: i think that's the most likely scenario, Rashed|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes|pg||

pc|h7|nt|panosk: depends on my mood, if serious no :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: best contract|pg||

nt|panosk: 6nt looks gd as cards lie|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 2@D I'm told is GF stayman, why he'd do it with only one major I don't know|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|sybarra: bd 5  6 @H a push |pg||

nt|henryb:  gm Shirley @h|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I'm watching live cricket from England I bet Roalnd is too|pg||

nt|henryb:  England - India?|pg||

nt|loe48: 3rd seat 1s okay|pg||

nt|blewah: as you predicted|pg||

nt|ianmcc: who wants to be in 6?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: I agree, no harm to pass 1@H and wait for P's response who is not a passed hand.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|peachy: E in good position to check on keycards |pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed, 3NT .|pg||

nt|panosk: E doesnt know which major but he correctly thinks its spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are various methods, my multi 2@D = weak 2 either major OR 20-22 with a 5 card suit OR and 8+ playing tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a lot of folks include a strong bid in multi  |pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  right...if they had garbage hand...but since 2N over 2@h would deny a 4 card major, they would have to bid 2@s with the invite hand and 4 spades.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||

pc|cK|nt|henryb:  Not true, Shirley. Multi can be used in any team game of 6+ boards where the players are "Flight A"|pg||

mb|2C|nt|panosk: thats really dangerous|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: nice pANOS|pg||
nt|sharkey: You open N hand 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Panos sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a dangerous 5@D bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @C holding in N hand and @h holding in S hand will be hard to describe|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kemperg: nice bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H now competitive or inviting?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Precision 2@C here, 6+ in the absence of a major, now 7+  NS will shortly be in game.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S is good raise of @D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since about 60% of our tables are now in team events, either 2-day KOs or Swiss, its not true that it is even close to barred|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: thats tempting :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i would|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kemperg: dbl should be inviting for me|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Too good for 2@H?|pg||
nt|loe48: to strong for 2h non vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Logically, it should be that for others, too|pg||
nt|loe48: if vul 2h okay|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, weak 2 is 4-8 with green against red|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: weak 2 is out of the question in any vul for me|pg||
nt|loe48: vul vs non vul i open 2h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: just a max in other circumstances for me|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kemperg: agree with you on the last hand, 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  W better lead a trump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can borrow one from E.:)|pg||
nt|panosk: if you need to open 1 is much beter |pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  anyone like N's 4@s bid?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kemperg: N agrees|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would not be my choice with 4-card @H's but they're obv on the same wavelength.|pg||
nt|peachy: North is delighted to go, five good trumps and a singleton|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and what % are Flight A ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he can't have liked his 2@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 2 aces S must bid 5NT. GS.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: I suspect that not many in North America and Europe have heard about the city Shenzhen in the Guangdong province, the venue for this tournament. Shenzhen has more than 10 million ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: inhabitants!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: @C lead would be interesting.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if K@c is lead, E needs to rise with A and return @d|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, no worries for 5@d:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||

nt|blewah: and 5 card support|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what a horror double|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6N was indeed found CR for another 2 imps|pg||

nt|ianmcc: N/S probably unhappy but N/S closed not laughing either|pg||
nt|panosk: -1 shud be gd result for NS|pg||
nt|loe48: yes -1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|panosk: EW can make 4@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: The opening hands on Bd 9 and Bd 7 are rated equal according hand evaluator - 11 HCP http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQx+AKJx+AK98+Kx|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS likely to get to 3 NT here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: 15 opposite 9 |pg||
nt|kerasidis: 1nt open by W here?|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: 10 with W having all the rest|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 10 actually and yes why didnt he tried at least ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 10, with all suits behaving nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: right 10 |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: more Precise here|pg||
mb|r|nt|sharkey: or EW may be in trouble...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|panosk: its not just the actual pts count he also had gd spots|pg||
nt|henryb:  Slam on a hook that loses|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@H down on the losing finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: What's good for the goose is good for the gander here with the ace underleads to NT dummy.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: S doesnt know N has values - unless he x|pg||
nt|panosk: he will soon :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: 6@C was -3 to make the carnage worth 15|pg||
nt|blewah: did it really make?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange and defence to other contracts after preempt by P.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: W keeps them out by bidding probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kerasidis: weird in my opinion....N doesnt know south's 18 points hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Score another one for weak NT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|loe48: south shall x again|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ianmcc: could be 300|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 was not that difficult to bid on last hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panosk: i'm a huge meckwell proponent as far as slam bidding is concerned need more than 50% chance to bid it |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sharkey: and - If N and W hands are reversed....|pg||
nt|loe48: if north bid 2h then bid 2s|pg||
nt|panosk: he wudnt run W|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  but they needed to have the right asking bids|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: nice defense|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he could claim only if he knew that there was an auto black squeeze on S @SK @CJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: that's what S said to N|pg||
nt|sharkey: What was 2@D?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panosk: brb|pg||

pc|d7|nt|andyv:  good evening everyone|pg||

pc|h6|nt|jaapfr: @CQ|pg||
nt|blewah: but N can hold @sJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: I play 12-15NT and I'd be adavncing with the N hand|pg||
nt|panosk: in many more aspects too :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  hey Jordan, Germ, Roland and all|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I've watched a lot of Meckwell and their slam bidding is quite weak, they do make up for it in other ways for sure|pg||
nt|blewah: so he was sure @sK would be left bare by S?|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@h probably asked for 3rd round control |pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: and 5@S showed yes.|pg||
nt|blewah: they must have played together before|pg||
nt|kerasidis: West thinks now.. ouffff what a releif :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: As the linesmen used to say when we came on court at 6-5 in the third set, "We only come in to close."|pg||
nt|blewah: anyway, slam now|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: you are right 2 cards of @H.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: But there S did bid 3NT over 2@H.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ending trick 11 W @SAX @CJ and E last trump and @SQx so south 100% squeezed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: to me this is the worst auction so far|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no multi S will he bid 4 now, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@d, one or both majors?|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone texas the hand?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think they dont like slams as much as they do games hence they become more conservative not that they cant |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: seems 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One, the Multi defense|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|kemperg: not me|pg||

pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: too weak.|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes on a @h lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd bid it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had a leap to 2 nt over a minor,  never sure waht it means |pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think 6@h is too hard|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: I abhor that fatuous 2NT resposne to the nebulous 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: i "hate" is what is should say |pg||
nt|panosk: more or less same as what 1nt does :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: abhor = fancy word for hate :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: true but should not be bid.|pg||
nt|blewah: Precision EW|pg||

nt|andyv:  in mp I agree....not sure in imps |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/LandyMulti.html|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as the Woolsey defense when it backfires, says Steve Robinson|pg||
nt|pfbr: morning Roland@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GM dear A @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  S would need to be clairvoyant and not lead a @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: knowing pard will open any pathetic 11 count should be good reason for not lurching to 2NT|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: forgive my absence as I am cooking in order to be around for the last set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H/@S on @S finesse.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|blewah: "i claim, S will have to have @sK and @cJ  when I play the 11th trick"|pg||
nt|blewah: @cQ. sry|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: has 3 losers but 4@S had 4 tough hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  5@h asks for quality of @h suit|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kerasidis: about the previous....does north know that his partner has 18 points?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ianmcc: North has to lead Black?|pg||
nt|blewah: can make with the trump lay out|pg||
nt|andyv:  are there enough tricks on @h lead?|pg||
nt|blewah: needs to run @h from dummy twice|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blewah: need to ruf 1 @d only i think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to play.|pg||
nt|andyv:  harder than it looks|pg||

nt|andyv:  very true|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to see the danger but probably a no cost play to lead a @s on trick 2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Play a @S right back before the @D ruffing pos'n established - |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the multi in CR bought 2NT which was -3|pg||
nt|blewah: ruff @d now and play another @h|pg||
nt|kerasidis: and if he does why not bidding 2 nt over 2spades?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: justice here|pg||
nt|panosk: yes that was a lucky break|pg||

nt|andyv:  wonder if 3N shows longer @cs|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl and then??|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 9, 5@D x -1 in CR.|pg||
nt|andyv:  best for N to pass|pg||
nt|panosk: i quite like 1nt here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: t|pg||
nt|loe48: 13-15. and x on same values..|pg||
nt|kerasidis: so would you stay in nt doubled with 6 points?|pg||
nt|loe48: so 15+|pg||
nt|panosk: for sure|pg||
mb|3H|nt|panosk: more informative than mere 2@D|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello Gary and everyone.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: he knows the Shenzen tong|pg||

nt|andyv:  whatever it shows, E can't sit for it|pg||

nt|sybarra: sometimes you get to play it here |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cant be all bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@h is truly a dreamer's bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Rashed good to have your company @H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  you dream that S will have the right dummy for you|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panosk: and if pard stronger i dont mind playing higher than 1|pg||
nt|blewah: and he proved he was right by misguessing the Q trump :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: I'm not privvy to their agreements nor that steady on Precision, what might 4NT mean I wonder|pg||
nt|sybarra: that puts it to declarer |pg||
nt|panosk: yes shud be torchoured a bit for his bid :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: how ever you spell tortured,  that is being done|pg||
nt|panosk: i meant tortured of course|pg||
nt|panosk: E carefully took with A@H so no clues|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N of course should pull to 2@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think with so many english words it is difficult for europeans |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CR in 5@S X I'm told so another swing coming|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid but makes 6@H as the cards are placed.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: we have words that sound the same and spelled differently |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kemperg: E did not go for the possible penalty pass in W, |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not a peep from EW to worry them either|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c forced 2@d I think|pg||
nt|blewah: XYZ convention or some sort|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree with 2nd double from South then N shud act|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud have ducked @D lead|pg||
nt|loe48: i mean, how much do they need to sit on it..not much hps left out now besides what he had|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d5|pc|h8|nt|andyv:  this should go down 2|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kemperg: No opening in W so perhaps good decision|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of bidding being done |pg||
nt|andyv:  looking at all 4 hands, EW are hard pressed to bid and make anything|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: now EW make 2NT on defence|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  no useful pitch coming on J@c|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kerasidis: opps play weak nt so double can be weaker...that was my point|pg||
nt|loe48: 15+|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  somewhere the wheels came off or maybe W just decided to chance it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Cannot blame E for this one I wouldn't think.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: almost|pg||
nt|panosk: or i shud have studied harder when my parents paid for my english classes :)|pg||

nt|andyv:  Jordan, blaming partner is an art form...can't just be done on the spur|pg||
nt|andyv:  N might open 1N|pg||
nt|panosk: so much depth in this game makes you feel stupid quite often|pg||
nt|andyv:  they led a @s in OR...I think that will set 6@hs|pg||
nt|sharkey: Last hand cud have been made if duck @D lead|pg||

mb|1C|nt|kemperg: not when 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yes, hand is a point shy but LOOKS like a 1NT opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S raising  (I would) |pg||
nt|blewah: pass?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes even with 1 pt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C for EW has good play in this badly distributed hand.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: The case of the missing initial pass.|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad, 1@h by S would have been more fun|pg||
nt|andyv:  awkward dbl by W unless it shows a Major and Minor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that one will be hard to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S should be happy to sit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: me too Shirley|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh dear me |pg||

nt|panosk: W cant acrually go higher, E might have KQ in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Thereis no point in playing negative doubles if East passes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if EW forgot what they were playing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|kemperg: no system against 1NT:(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@C by E and 2@D by W. |pg||
nt|andyv:  with 8 tricks off the top, this should be a nice pick up for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  W dbl, unless conventional, was ill advised.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a big Pass from East|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this could be expensive since EW don't have a game|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: S didn't open on 11 eventually gained 2 imps for his side|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: Well it is not like there are not potential losses from failing to identify a 5-bagger major.|pg||
nt|andyv:  HongMian on roll having scored the last 24 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: routine 3NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  there must by some system glich for W not to be able to show a weak hand with the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|andyv:  S will run to 3@c...then the fun should begin|pg||
nt|jcwla: And end - with 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: doesnt N have a michaels bid or something?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E better that a 2@S raise 3 for me|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  nope, both of us are wrong|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, my prediction was conditional upon yours.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kiwibridge: EW only reached 3@S so just 1 imp|pg||
nt|blewah: NS play prec|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok, so the run was to 4@c...I was just premature|pg||
nt|kemperg: no transfers on weak 1NT and no Stayman relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play constructive raises  but also some form of bergen |pg||
nt|panosk: N has a 2@H bid i think|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: why not 2 @S? |pg||
nt|blewah: OK, as a spec's information, they play weak NT and 4+@d, so N decided to pass in the previous board|pg||
nt|blewah: 13-15NT to be precised|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S would pull to 4@C or 3NT to play?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: favourable lead and all over.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: michaels |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we call ours Truscott in Acol 1@S-3@S = good raise to 2|pg||
nt|panosk: i like hearts :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but as passed hand,  you need a tool with that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like that bid Gary |pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: possible to give less space to opps|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kiwibridge: on 13|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|blewah: not easy to find low @s from W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no small @S and would make.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes,  difficult.|pg||
nt|blewah: but what options does he have?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  interesting contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am somehow not a fan of opening NT with 5 major. 3NT makes 9 tricks but 4@H a superior contract.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks, it works very well, of course as we play 4 card majors it guaranteed 4 card support|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kemperg: 2@S worked very well for EW here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|blewah: likely 8 trick already available for cdecl|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: wow.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: I think any "leaping"  should be 4 card support |pg||
nt|blewah: well done!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: 4 or  5 card majors |pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: indeed I agree|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: I on the other hand open all 5332 12-15's 1NT :)|pg||

nt|panosk: and W shud pass|pg||
nt|panosk: i think best line is small spade from dummy|pg||
nt|loe48: yes if need to open it self..but last you do after checking spots|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcwla: Who gets the charge there?|pg||
nt|panosk: i dont like playing clubs either |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  mastercard|pg||
nt|andyv:  no charge...NS very aggressive...didn't work|pg||
nt|andyv:  this hand a bit testy for NS....need to stop low or defend|pg||
nt|kerasidis: north could have the last trump|pg||
nt|loe48: you can play on honor double on both sides with success|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: S has a nice hand in context of the X  -- arguably didn't give pd a lot of leeway but possibly N could show 2-suiter instead?|pg||
nt|panosk: constructive bids shud stay lower, in my opinion|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree panos |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no opening S no preempt W|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: routine hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: might make 1NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  this hand easy to play from here...at the table, N will have problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you have to have discussion with pard,  as to what bids mean as passed hand |pg||
nt|rnmalik: any major suit contract losing 3 aces only:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think S passed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That low:)|pg||
nt|blewah: pass?|pg||
nt|panosk: but its not beter than finess|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  doubld dummy 4@c probably only goes down one|pg||
nt|andyv:  double|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  right Rashed:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: alas|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: disappointing|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe one of the few pairs in the world that can stop at 2@c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: undo pl.|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think E bid 5@s|pg||
nt|panosk: double or 3@S with W hand?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I prefer double|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: no remedy for being conservative and losing a vul game.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: sry|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: sry:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: it's the first time i do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: except when pard misreads it|pg||
nt|sybarra: that maybe is result of X |pg||
nt|sybarra: W had best find 4 @S (imo)|pg||
nt|panosk: what do you think about double as t/o from E straight after 3@C?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS almost make 3N on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I prefer 3 @S,  not resulting,  but I do not have 4 @H's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ideal Panos, says I have @H + @D + tolerance for @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pause - North "knows" where @SJ is...?|pg||
nt|loe48: well it was a marked stop as i dont like to see..but poor connection? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: May have been better take 1st @S trick here as @S blocked|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|loe48: but pretty much be the same as have entress anyways|pg||
nt|kerasidis: could even give the impression that he has Ajx in spdes :)'|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  if they played ELC, then N was on track to do just that (show the 2 suits)|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are doiing fine:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed to make the contract but timing of suit play  has to be good.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E only has 6 pts |pg||
pc|d4|nt|kemperg: duck and it goes of it own>)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that the X doesnt promise a bit more |pg||
nt|sybarra: from E |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jcwla: N's @S holding means S is not going to convert a X - and N not going to sit for @C's - so what is the point of X rather than a 2-suited bid that would surely slow S down?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: dealing with todays preempts means you sometimes have to lower the point requirements|pg||
nt|blewah: and they are minotities in this world of modern bidding|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|blewah: minorities|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panosk: tough call i have no positive answer either|pg||
nt|sybarra: from my point of view,  the X would include k of @H's for example|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont think its enough for a X |pg||
nt|sybarra: now, if playing neg frees,  perhaps he bids 3 @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe with spade tolerance he can bid 3 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but that cuts the possible @H fit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: Something like what happened seems relatively foreseeable.|pg||
nt|andyv:  was S hand worth a 3@c bid with this vul?|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems bad but no problems now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even now makes.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D switch.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  with everyon play 2way new minor and xyz and pdq, etc....2@c has almost become non existent as a spot to play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  S will have to be careful here not to lose 3@c tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: depends on  meaning of the dbl|pg||
nt|jcwla: We know from 14 that the double promises short @C's|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks everybody, g'night :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  gn Raija|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kemperg: bye Raija|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 2 top honours the way I play it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not play precision,  so no clue what is best |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: mm 4 top losers and bad @C break|pg||
nt|panosk: double was inspired|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been informed that winners of each match get bonus points and in case of a tie both get 1/2 point. Poor losers :)|pg||
