mb|6S|nt|Walddk4: close|pg||

mc|13|nt|Walddk4: Amazing :)|pg||

nt|minimeck: we shall see if lien takes the push to 6@d|pg||

pc|dA|nt|minimeck: fireworks to start things off... here lankveld 6-4 in the majors blasts slam opposite bos' michaels, missing 2 cashing aces, |pg||
pc|d5|nt|galois85: it seems 4@sX -3 2@d 2@c 1@s and 1@h|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|minimeck: will likely find the shift here to set 6s, however, the other table, q@c lead allows 7@dx to roll home|pg||

nt|minimeck: 17 imps to ned juniors|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: reminiscent of the famous hand france vs usa in olympiad 1980s where hamman had to pick which ace was standing up|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|galois85: bad return... now just -1|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: if you are worried that the contract might actually make, you don't lead the singleton|pg||
nt|athene: because the danger is it's a huge double fit hand|pg||

mb|3H|mb|4D|nt|play4fun55:  Can North throw enough sand into the mashinery to stop them from getting there ?|pg||
nt|rensph: Probably not, vulnerability isn't exactly helping him|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|play4fun55:  3 h is actually helping, giving West the chance to quebid to show slam interest|pg||
nt|rensph: surely they would've managed without interference as well|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  What I mean is that the only action (improbable) that could make life hard would be 4 h |pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rensph: had south been able to bid 4@H it might've been difficult|pg||

nt|galois85: better anticipate clubs... after a@d and k@d |pg||
nt|galois85: nothing to do|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||
nt|athene: just lose the sixth club most of the time|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2N!|nt|mrdct: moysian 6@d here|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a big fan of that sort of thing though|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|athene: it helps if you can make unusual notrump bids later in the auction with confidence partner will know you are showing diamonds of course :)|pg||
mb|p!|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt extremely unlikely to be the best contract when you have such a shapely two-suiter|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: 3nt is for balanced hands and one-suiters|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, agreed, very suprising, especially if 3h was a cue|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|athene: was 2NT just general good/bad?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: 6NT right sided here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mrdct: quite a lucky make with @c 3-3 and @sK onside|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|galois85: it seems -1 by guessing the @dj |pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps the operator could inform us of the alerts|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might not realise they have any diamond fit at all - he might just think 2nt was showing a competitive 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES IT WAS|pg||
nt|athene: i would just rebid 3@D with the east hand, and if i get too high, so be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: west explained it could be weak with clubs or some good hands|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|minimeck: an immediate answer for the US, EW have bid to 6@d after a 3h overcall and 4d bid|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: undo that - the @s hook and @c break are only good for 10 tricks|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|athene: the italians tend to play that opener just doubles with any good hand so he is free to bid his suits on a shapely hand|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s9|pc|d5|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|h9|nt|play4fun55:  no, no problem|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: 1 or 2 more imps for japan here|pg||
nt|pelu: tell us Andrea - what would 1@s from W show?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 CARDS |pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzmw: I MENA 2 SPADES SHOWS 3 CARDS|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: MEAN|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the open south chose to make a cue instead of single raise, got them to game|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|galois85: Dbl  at first round shows 4@s+ 1@s is a sputnik dbl without spades ( of mancinelli I mean)|pg||
nt|pelu: was 2@S forcing? - or an underbid?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mrdct: japan came 3rd in the asia-pacific championships in kuala lumpur in june so have qualified for next year's world youth championships expect to be in cuba|pg||
nt|galois85: underbid|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west's double was helpful to opponents|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west had far too many clubs for a lead in that suit to be productive|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: Andrea, can u tell us about the players - I exp that the 2 italian teams here are 2.. 3. or 4. best?|pg||
nt|galois85: well of course the singleton  in the first suite of his partner seems a bad distribution, but after knowing that the king of hearts maybe is well placed and the 4cards fit of my ...|pg||
nt|galois85: partner I surely bid 4... |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|galois85: well I think most of the italian players are at their first of second experience.|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|gulyas: probably too strong for a 15-17NT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: after this lead, he may make with an endplay|pg||
nt|gulyas: cash 5@Ds, and see what E discards|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|gulyas: if he throws 2 @Ss, he will be endplayed with @Hs to lead away from the @CK in the end|pg||
nt|gulyas: after cashing the @SA of course|pg||
nt|rensph: could W not lead a club through when in with @H9 then?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||

pc|hA|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c3|nt|gulyas: right, W's @Hs are good enough to win with them to lead a @C thru|pg||

nt|athene: pretty much all hands with a six card suit are a game try after pardy raises|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mrdct: 2@s for NS and maybe 3@d for EW here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|galois85: 2@d natural or weak fit |pg||
mb|d!|nt|athene: to be fair the hands did fit extremely well|pg||
nt|athene: it was very hard to diagnose that|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, bos' 2@d call seems to have disuaded him enough |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrdct: but lack of entries to south's hand make it hard to make 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S in family with Guiseppe Failla, who played for the Blue team?|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: giuseppe is now responsible for youth  in italy|pg||
nt|pelu: hard job|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt interesting on small heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: five rounds of diamonds give east a few worries|pg||
nt|athene: you might throw him in with a heart to lead a club|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, and that is where the open room has arrived, we shall see how it goes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: but i think the defence should prevail |pg||
pc|h8|nt|galois85: Giuseppe is also watching the match at this table|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct: as it happens a passive @d lead may have been best to let declarer do all of the work|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|pelu: why not 3x@H and then @D?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|minimeck: treating the hand too strong for a 1nt opener, the inevitable contract, a chance for a well deserved pickup|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: low club shift rather than diamond :)|pg||
nt|halila: at the 2nd trick playÃ½ng a small club may defeat the contravt|pg||

nt|pelu: same 5@h in CR - and 5@s by N|pg||

mb|2N|nt|athene: borderline decision for west over 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: play 4@S or make a mild slam try?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|halila: Ã½ think it is wrongly written|pg||
nt|athene: now opener has room to bid 4@H to show a good hand for spades i guess|pg||
nt|athene: he has mostly "hard" cards, so he might do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: despite having only two spades|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS likely here|pg||
nt|athene: quite control-rish|pg||
nt|athene: rich|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKQ doubleton, which was the flaw when he opened, is suddenly worth a lot|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt looks a bit much, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: apart from anything, the limited hand isn't normally the one to take control|pg||
nt|athene: not in well-controlled auctions anyway :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Bos will have to activate his sonar and find the diamond jack :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|halila: it can be down with a careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamonds 5-1 means the limit of hand is 1nt|pg||
mb|6S|nt|mrdct: interesting that NS put balanced 20-counts into their 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: what to bid in S - 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: and is 2Nt naturel or for minor?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south may solve that problem for him at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: difficult - i guess if you want to be passive, a trump lead is preferable|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea tough lead problem for lien, trump club, diamond?|pg||
nt|minimeck: trump seems the safest, not going to pick off pard with q@s :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you operator, yes, :) k@h not possible|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: diamond might well find partner's honour for them; i like a trump here, although you don't usually lead a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: @HK into a 2nt opener....hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but 3|pg||
nt|athene: as a rule, it's right to lead aggressively against 6 of a suit, but this auction might be an exception|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|mrdct: the @h7 is a big card here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt better than 3@C - West can get 2@d ruffs|pg||
nt|galois85: yes... 2nt I think is natural|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - where did East get that 3@H from?|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason you would lead a heart is to set up a trick fast before declarer throws heart losers on a side suit|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|minimeck: indeed, definetely merit to leading the heart|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: that is unlikely to be the issue here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu: @D8: signal for @s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: as is the @h6|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|s7|nt|pelu: Pionto just dropped at trick|pg||
nt|athene: but of course it's easy to construct layouts where a heart is the only lead to beat|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|minimeck: 26 imp swing coming|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|nt|athene: declarer can ruff the long heart good but he still has to get to hand to cash it|pg||
nt|minimeck: alot of options now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: @C9 looks the least useful card from the easy hand|pg||

nt|minimeck: if this were the open event, we'd now see a 5-10 minute tank|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: diamond back right now|pg||
nt|minimeck: 20 seconds and there it is|pg||
nt|athene: but it's too late|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: declarer now has to decide whether to finesse or play to bring the heart down but whatever he chooses will work|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|mrdct: ned young a chance to get a donut in this match|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|halila: a flat bord|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting methods but the normal contract non-theless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: exactly four spades|pg||
nt|athene: there is some merit to this sort of thing, the idea being to conceal from the defenders whether declarer has four hearts|pg||
nt|athene: since that isn't of any interest to east|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: IF i was forced to bid I would X - but a clÃ¦ear pass for me|pg||

mb|2D|nt|rensph: I don't completely understand it either. @DJ instead of @D9 is somewhat of a mystery to me as well.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|rensph: looks like a matter of guessing trumps for an overtrick here|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  looks like we are finnishing off the match with an easy 4h, and should be a push|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Cs friendly, its 4 or 5|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: certo cara|pg||
nt|pelu: ok Last board|pg||
nt|minimeck: last board here for this segment, hope to see everyone back for the last of today|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: some might open 1nt with west|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrdct: 4@h has some play here|pg||
nt|athene: a bit bent but not too bad|pg||
mb|1D|nt|minimeck: credit netherlands for a well played match, besides the first board, some good play all around|pg||
mb|d!|nt|pelu: 1@D - 1@S - 2NT?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d!|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|pelu: here I would just bid 3Nt in W why make the bidding more complex?|pg||
nt|galois85: I again agree with peter... 10 with ad in @s 2Nt is a better choice|pg||
nt|athene: double of 1@D = 4+ hearts i assume|pg||
nt|athene: and double of 2@D is support (3 hearts)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|galois85: to play 3@d it seems...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: according to rodwell, 1nt on those hands is by faaar a % winner, but don't ask me to explain the science :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|minimeck: you'd have to look in his secret files to which i don't have access|pg||
nt|athene: the trend at the top level is to open 1nt more and more on the "middling strength" 5422 and even 5431 hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the end, a flat board to finish us out|pg||
nt|athene: because it simplifies things|pg||
nt|minimeck: specifically also with stiff k|pg||
nt|athene: lots of ways you run into trouble opening, for example, 4-5-2-2 15 count with 1@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: 1Nt here - In my book = 8-10, so easy 3Nt from W|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|athene: partner bids 1nt and you wish you opened 1nt|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|c3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: well, best chance to make a stiff king is to open 1nt :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|halila: an unlucky board |pg||
nt|mrdct: if he gets @h right chance to get opps to open up the @s suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|halila: 4-0 trumps and spade Quenn off side|pg||
nt|mrdct: but no hope now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|h6|nt|mrdct: so japan are looking good for a max|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|halila: -1|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|athene: south hasn't turned up with much|pg||
nt|athene: but then he doesn't need much for 2@D in that position|pg||
nt|minimeck: thanks for tuning in everyone, next match in 45 min|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't know that the @HK is marked there|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|galois85: it's ok 1nt, 2nt...but on 3@c need to call 3nt... one can count to 9...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: ok, well done|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|galois85: tnx peter and operator!|pg||
