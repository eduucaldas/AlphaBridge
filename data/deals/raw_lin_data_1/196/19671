nt|gulyas: I am sure if he knew they were 4-3 in @Ss, he would have led sg else|pg||
nt|minimeck: so perhaps the overtrick at issue|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, and it also counts as an IMP, 270=7|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|minimeck: this allowed declarer to draw two rounds of trump and pitch 4 spades on the clubs|pg||

nt|minimeck: Leads against slams are never clear, k@h seemed safe for west|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|minimeck: but oftentimes you need to cash the ace, holding a singleton trump, was a huge risk|pg||

nt|gulyas: 2@S a safe spot|pg||

nt|minimeck: this will drift one or two off, a good result, hard to double it with either hand|pg||
