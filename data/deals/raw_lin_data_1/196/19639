nt|psyck: the preemption seems to have worked other table with some overbidding|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|zebutin: for me 4@H seem little stretched|pg||
nt|psyck: it indeed was|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@S is 8-11|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you in croatia Matt?|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is a junior tournament, so expect alot of fireworks here, both pairs are pretty agressive :|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: and 4+ cards unbalanced (or 5+ balanced)|pg||
nt|minimeck: today is actually my birthday, 26 now too old :x|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
mb|1H|nt|zebutin: so Koistinen has maximum for their bidding|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: no players names yet|pg||
mb|d|nt|minimeck: it's ok, time for our young stars for their chance in the spotlight|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: will play 3@h undoubled here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought you might be close to the "edge" |pg||
mb|4H|nt|zebutin: this most likely goes 3 or so down, so small pickup for Finland|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is pretty much a cake walk for declarer,  not much to say |pg||
nt|minimeck: While this appears to be a flat four hearts, NS in the open room got a bit carried away, are now rotting in 4@s x , which appears to be 5 or 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: balanced 7points (essentially 6 with Jxx in @D) isn't usually something you want to bid 4with against partners t/o double, even though partner does have short @D...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|minimeck: given we have a nice close nit group here (few kibs so far) feel free to message with questions or comments :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wiki: loosing 2 @S @H and @C  or two|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi valerie westheimer :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi Murat|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hopefully we will get the names up soon|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I mean so we can click on them|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: at the other table N bid only 2@D at first, and when partner raised to 3@D found more from pre-emptive hand and bid 4@D...|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have opened 3@d too|pg||
pc|s8|nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks quite hard decision to defende 1 @d .instead of play some @s or nt -contract|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s no hope here|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: No p;ay here|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|runnerup: ok|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|psyck: @h9 should have alerted dec to the trump position|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Well he stole 1 trick|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay    just 2 diamonds to lose in 4@H|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|wiki: @H ruff possible|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|psyck: don't particularly like the @h9 play but N had a tough guess on what to play. Declarer should have probably started @c after winning @hK|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C suit has some chances for defence too... if S ducks couple times with A, might be enough to make Jansons finese @C 10|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Giusy, could we get player names for N-S please?|pg||
nt|ricky86: with good division of clubs 3 nt it's an easy contract |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ricky86: italy has to avoid a game in majors|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They usually have their system hand-written on a napkin; not so easy to scan|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ricky86: I've got their system but it's incomplete :)|pg||

nt|zebutin: so AUNI takes the early lead with small pickup|pg||

nt|minimeck: welcome Traian|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: id call that lucky 4 hearts|pg||
nt|galois85:  clearly flags are inverted here|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: @c lead needed here ( from KJ( to beat 4 @s maybe |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1@C is 15-17nt or 12-16 unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
mb|1C|nt|minimeck: indeed, :) needed the trump suit to cooperate there. they will take it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be this will end in 1 spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: both tables chose 1N to 2@c overcall|pg||

mb|1S|nt|penseur9: Hi Markkhu|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt on a @s lead here appears doomed|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Edgettons in the open room are superstars in our part of the world...|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: usually not 6th club in 1nt, but tells strength quite closely, and shape not too much off...|pg||
nt|minimeck: appears they failed to find the club shift on board 21 so first blood to the americans|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|wiki: EW is bidding very differently in open and closed as close open all 8 or more|pg||
nt|zebutin: not even singelton or two|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both ok |pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, will be interesting to see if east raises to 2|pg||
nt|minimeck: do EW play a strong club variant of some sort (with limited openings)?|pg||
nt|ady: with clubs 3-3  3NT easy for e/w|pg||
mb|3H|nt|zebutin: Koistinen knows that 16 is max for Nyberg... but must have something good for jump to 3@H in zone|pg||
nt|bebechira: Nabil will play in Veldhoven in the open team... the youngest ever :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: an interesting trend in junior qualifiers recently, going to 10 board round robin / swiss matches, very few boards with a world championship on the line, :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
mb|3S|nt|runnerup: hi Andre'|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They seem to be getting too hugh here|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They can bail out at 4@c & make that|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to stop with 16 opp 8|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: True|pg||
nt|minimeck: and a practical 2@c bid here by lankveld, will find a very nice place to play |pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: No, but probably 1@s is limited|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: 1@d is better minor|pg||
nt|minimeck: grazie mille Fabio @h we are in good hands with our operator this morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: so well bid on both rooms, might be imp difference for either way, if declarer just takes 6@C+@H+@D+@S|pg||
nt|ady: east will have to give preference to spades  but then west should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3nt cold but, difficult stop on 3nt with 5-5 M|pg||
mb|4H|nt|zebutin: or if defender tosses 1 diamond away, declarer fineses and takes 6@C, @S, @H , 3@D|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this 12 board semifinal will play one of the Finnish teams in the 12 board Finals to follow after this.|pg||
nt|zebutin: or declarer can double finese in @D, but I honestly don't see that happening...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he lead kindly but still should fail|pg||
nt|bebechira: not a lot of room to "recover"  if you make a mistake :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: :) I hope for you :)|pg||
nt|ady: only preference bid for spades   and with a moderate suit west should bid 3NT    east can always convert to spades with a better holding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: But if they get to game (in clubs) probably the heart lead has been pin pointed now.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: A lot of work to do here, in 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: hard gamble by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: This might help|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i must admit i had passed out 1 spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: pls change names - these are last tim's|pg||
pc|dK|nt|exerdar: hearts 3-3 this good news for declerar|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play well to make this|pg||
nt|exerdar: if just gives 3 spades ,he can do it|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|zebutin: after opponents have bid @D as their suit, Nyberg might have void in that, so @D A isnt pulling all the weight it could be...so disciplined pass|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @S return still 3 tricks coming for defence, which would be 7 imps for finland|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will have 10 rounds of Swiss... and then QF,SF and F|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|minimeck: indeed, Maximo really decided to simply deny them the contract with the balancing 1nt here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but 3 clubs is a very nice spot|pg||
nt|minimeck: certainly a stretch but that is their overall style of bidding|pg||
pc|cK|nt|janhamhurg: cash 2 spades and crossruff 6 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|minimeck: QF and SF 3 16 board segments, with a final of 4 14 board segments and (3rd place playoff of 3 segemnts) at least they went to all day matches for the semis and quarterfinals|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|pelu: didn't N see the bidding - on their way to 3Nt buit no @H-stop|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|vdoubleu: South was on lead, &, apparently not.|pg||
nt|pelu: W didn't accept the help (3x@D) and disc a @h|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|runnerup: @h guess needed and done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894|pg||
nt|exerdar: hopss|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|minimeck: it is also interesting to note only 27 teams entered the event as opposed to 40 in istanbul, I was somewhat suprised by the decreased attendence given the location in europe|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ianmcc: slam for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    e/w can make 9 tricks in hearts  |pg||
mb|2S|nt|zebutin: this table playing much faster than other table, they have almost taken the 2 deal lead up, so soon no comparisons from this table...|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|play4fun55:  a good 4 h e/w|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: anyone 2 dia here?|pg||
nt|minimeck: they open very light, i would imagine Garcia da rosa not liking his options here, i predict a shoulder shrugging pass|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 12 imps is alot for winning 3 clubs...|pg||
nt|minimeck: not the best discarding by ferro, came down to K10 of diamonds allowed them to run both suits|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 down is a havy disaster|pg||

pc|c6|nt|bebechira: well said Matt... 27 teams... a very disapointing number for a world event......|pg||

nt|minimeck: and another very bold balancing NT here by NS|pg||

nt|minimeck: throwing all caution into the wind :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|zebutin: declarer could maybe get 9 tricks for all important imp, but most likely going to be even board|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Here comes the spade 8 on the track.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: do you like it?|pg||

pc|cA|nt|minimeck: yes, two strong teams at that :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: our goal is 1st and 2nd place|pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  shouldn't be that difficult: five side winners and cross ruff away|pg||
nt|minimeck: do they also have the rule here regarding semifinals and two teams from the same country (as with the bermuda bowl and USA1/2)?|pg||
nt|bebechira: good point , lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably|pg||
nt|minimeck: will hit the jackpot, however, with p's double heart stopper, to me personally the risk seems far greater than the reward|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: sooner or later we will have one big board which will decide the match :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bebechira: i will give a link with a teriffic youtube video made by Maz ( east here)|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|pelu: @s7 for @D - I was not sure that East could see that @s8 was a singleton|pg||
nt|minimeck: I completely agree, especially when pard will open most all 11s in their strong club system|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wiki: Linden is  now very conservative / not bidding 2 @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: East started smiling and said that N wanted them to play 1NT.... N said no with a smile..... 3NT :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: atleast Koistinen is honest...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|zebutin: now most likely takes 1 round of spades and tries @H ruff...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the previous event Tebha represented pakistan, following in Zia's footsteps now with the USA|pg||
nt|minimeck: ARG URU, really showing an agressive intent in these matches we have seen so far, yesterday against japan they recieved a speeding ticket on the first board |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|zebutin: now with @C finese could thros @H to strong @C|pg||
nt|zebutin: if it would work that is...with this distribution would make this go one more down...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|zebutin: thros = throw...|pg||

nt|ianmcc: very cheap slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Aussies playing this event with 2 teams|pg||
nt|ianmcc: both very good teams|pg||

nt|bebechira: a lot of superstars in the teams|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 3NT might make here by South, on a spade lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: i do like the choice made at the other table however, with a 3rd seat opener of 1d, that seems much more preferable to the balance|pg||
nt|ady: spade slam here|pg||
nt|exerdar: a slam board.. every slam possible withouth hearts:)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|bebechira: the cheap slam scored 13 for us :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: 4 hearts makes on a spade lead, but will be difficult on a dia or a cl lead|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4nt ?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ady: may not be so easy to reach a slam after 1 spade opened|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: a strong @H contract here for EW|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cards lie well for 3NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: not sure if EW have changed their NT ranges, would have expected a 2nt opener from brescoll here, 1@c will work much better :p|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He should play all to make this and will.|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: E/W got this one cheap, might even make, or @D H lead making comfortably...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt seems like normal spot to be in, might have some difficulties with entries for @C, but when @D 10 drops has always sure entry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might need a good guess  in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you fond of 2 nt with W?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wiki: 6 @C is on and  needs 1/1 clubs  which is odds or @h finesse  also you can try to get cover on @DQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: Juzz has a very good feel at the table.... i think he will make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not - perhaps a discard on @d|pg||
mb|d|nt|bebechira: 2 aces and a trump|pg||
nt|bebechira: in theory lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: previos hand number 2 both rooms made 4 @s -which should have been beaten -no guess in @h helps if south takes his ace and playes a small @c to his partner to play @s |pg||
nt|penseur9: the lead will decide how many extra tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4NT does not really get the imformation of great diamond cards  and the Q@C   and nothing opposite the singleton heart|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ianmcc: this helps. Now the discard a real possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: 3nt a good spot on this hand|pg||

nt|galois85:  what is E thinking about?|pg||
nt|ady: better west refraains from the double of 3@H  when he will be on lead |pg||
nt|exerdar: probably south is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: 10 boards matches... not a lot of boards to recover the bad ones :)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|zebutin: or without @S lead has always sure entry in @S suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: currently our 4th and 5th place teams here, should have no problem making here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: 3 no looks fine|pg||
nt|minimeck: and indeed that is where they will play it :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: lol your lead:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: i expect a spade lead here from west, although he has some choices, no winning options :p|pg||
mb|6S|nt|wiki: I thin 4 @D is splinter|pg||
nt|wiki: luckily we have very qualified operator|pg||
nt|minimeck: although a diamond is more logical|pg||
nt|minimeck: given the fact if his partner had any real spades he likely would have opened in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: well done ladies|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: you have problems only if  clubs are 2 0 with W  East can easily be endplayed|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Maybe North shld bid a simple 3N|pg||
mb|d|an|4/5!s|nt|zebutin: 4@C most likely Namyats,promising foor hand in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: this deal will extend the lead significantly|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: 3 spade is ok now i thk|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ianmcc: 4@h a chance for E/W|pg||

nt|minimeck: with a free 4s from partner?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and never mind the vulnerability |pg||
nt|minimeck: but certainly no clear options here, besides a blast, spec offers 5c?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wiki: par contract / NS can make 2 @S|pg||
nt|bebechira: ace of clubs lead in the open room.... gave the vikings 12 back :(|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Not much of one--a heart suit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it shows a distributional hand so pd can act as here well done|pg||
nt|minimeck: max pressure now by Bos, hard for south to restrain himself|pg||

nt|zebutin: not many good returns from W|pg||
nt|zebutin: foor = good...|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: most likely making 10 tricks after finese of @C|pg||

nt|galois85:  2@c seems harder with clubs 1-4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wiki: and D by S|pg||
nt|minimeck: kib informs me they don't play a typical lebensohl, some sort of relay with 3c showing a minimum w/ 4s|pg||

mb|p|nt|galois85:  double dummy can be done 6@c: take diamond leading with ace, then q@s for the king, club finesse and then a@h and heart finesse, but seeing just 26 cards seems better to ruff an heart for discarding the @d on the @sK...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|runnerup: lead was bad but doent help this ho,e|pg||
nt|zebutin: they have played faster and have only 2 deals left to compare|pg||

nt|minimeck: Multi 2@d by south here, chance for a small pickup if they put on the brakes here, a pretty decent game, however|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the 2 teams here are placed 9 and 10 and close til the KO|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, but as we have all seen, a lot can change & usually does.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|play4fun55:  yes, 4 h is a nice resting place, but can they get there?|pg||

nt|ady: 7@S  not much of a save|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|wiki: Los Tollos is kind of spanish, but in finnish Tollo is how could I say it nicely, very wise guy maybe even stupid|pg||
nt|zebutin: @S finese is on and that suit is 3-2, so 6@H, 6@S or 6nt seem to be on|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we should shout louder for your team Traian |pg||
nt|bebechira: true... louder please|pg||
mb|6D|nt|wiki: not very wise guy |pg||
nt|pelu: 8 teams to the 1/4-final Wednesday|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: N-s are certainly trying.|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: 1D opening is usually 4+ cards in diamonds in an unbal distribution|pg||
nt|minimeck: bold 3@h by bos, but in the end looks to be headed for a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: im predicting 10 tricks, so 130 difference for 4 imps|pg||
nt|minimeck: one of the big benefits of opening NT, make it tough for the opps to come in on alot of hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: we will note score many VPS from this one it seems...|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting treatment of 3 @S |pg||
nt|minimeck: should have no trouble here to make 420|pg||
nt|sybarra: not every partnership plays this treatment|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 450|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: there is a safety play in diamonds   but I dont think this will make if diamonds are 4-0  even picking the suit up for 1 loser  as would have difficulty  using the hearts|pg||
pc|c6|nt|runnerup: ns has 7+ tricks in nt -but this looks strange contract and too high|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: for NS|pg||
nt|zebutin: Koistinen might feel he has done enough, partner could have just 12 points|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||

pc|d3|nt|penseur9: certainly way to high here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: X doesn't work|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: every bid was an overbid here so 1 off is the logical result...|pg||
nt|minimeck: for those wondering about the format for this event, it is a two day round robin followed by full day knockout matches for the top 8 teams|pg||
nt|minimeck: the rest of the teams play a consolation BAM teams :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: still very tight on the leaderboard, 8-16 with an 11 VP diference|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vdoubleu: No play here, but E/W can make a lot of hearts|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: jus pesky the @H's are 3/1 |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: (game in hearts)|pg||
nt|ady: cash out 2 top diamonds   and then set up hearts   as it happens 13 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wiki: But they cab play cards Viitasalo Salomaa are in national team and Viitasalo is also coaching them|pg||
nt|runnerup: no slam=|pg||

nt|runnerup: where was Lasses axe|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: N iis explaining the bidding, his explanation is nothing like the S hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: nice heart shift from tebha, passive def might save an imp|pg||
pc|h4|nt|zebutin: now seems like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: fierce auction in other room|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2 club losers and the ace of spades for an easy 620|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pelu: a LAW bid from S - and as u see with both red kings onside easy 4@H by EW|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But no one can bid, really.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|minimeck: a safe exit here by boss, they will need to attack clubs when they get back in|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|minimeck: although now he has no chance|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so its down 1, no swing|pg||
mc|13|nt|bebechira: at least some imps on 25.... NS did not bid the slam|pg||

nt|henryb:  Both Italian pairs missed the slam|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: time for a coffee, 28 hcp with an 8 card fit shouldnt be a problem|pg||
nt|minimeck: some action potential on this board|pg||
nt|ady: hand 16 Italy played 3NT  when 6@C failed   so Italy gained 13 imps  unfortunate for Turkey|pg||

mb|1S|nt|wiki: We have some Tuulas friends from Amsterdam here so maybe if you get some results you could tell also those|pg||
nt|henryb:  3 Shirley|pg||
nt|gsper:  Difficult to predict how many tricks in a @D contract.|pg||
nt|minimeck: south has nice hand over unusual 2nt :) indeed only two losers but could declarer handle the 4-0|pg||
mb|2H|nt|zebutin: 1@S not alerted? interesting choice with 109x only in @S...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt little lucky, but when @H 4-4 makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: @cQ max|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be a cruise to 4h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85:  must dbl o?|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3c possible too|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  14+17 < 33|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: that is normal finnish michaels highest and one of the lower /  2 NT forcing |pg||
nt|sybarra: and basically yuckky with no running suit |pg||
nt|gsper:  If 2NT were of the solid kind, S could have tried 3NT, which may make.|pg||
nt|minimeck: heart lead certainly best, might be able to establish spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: if east covers the jack|pg||
nt|gsper:  I am happy that I don't have to plan the play here.|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H  dubious overcall   1NT  might be better|pg||
mb|3S|nt|runnerup: 4 @h can be beaten 3nt looks ok |pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely to make|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  this will be a close encounter. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: @c9 only chance|pg||
nt|pelu: the transfer overcall can give somme good informations, but also give opp a lot of space and extra bids|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: even 4 @s down :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: 2@C maybe some gazilli variant, so 2@H denies 8+ or so hcp... |pg||
nt|psyck: EW play strong @c, so no gaz|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: it is a some kind of gazilli|pg||
nt|psyck: E just tried a tactical approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 3@C most likely puppet stayman and 3nt denying 4 or 5 card majors|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: well. if the club king was the dia king 6 is easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: difficult lead from W|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: w thought a lot|pg||
nt|pelu: a brave pass after his weak opening|pg||
nt|galois85:  too much values in spades and too less hearts, I agree with david|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|penseur9: yes 3nt definitly best contract here|pg||
nt|pelu: not a opening for me|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Not the best lead for the defense here.|pg||
nt|minimeck: as cards lie 12 tricks available in the 4-3 fit :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|runnerup: if red lead -ruff should be found|pg||
nt|zebutin: good lead, not everyones choice surely to lead from K98x to strong hand|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  j of spade in dummy is a golden card|pg||
nt|minimeck: might need to duck the heart, but that seems a very risky proposition|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|runnerup: south declaring it helps|pg||
nt|ady: this should be at least down 1|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ianmcc: he'll likely scramble 8 trix|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: 1 tricks for S|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry, but i woulnt think about 6 spades at the table so i dont consider it here seeing all the cards:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: as you said, must find something to analyze on a hand like this|pg||
nt|minimeck: but your correct, too often commentators can be unfair looking at all 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: W have shown his distribution after a relay sequence|pg||
nt|minimeck: bos thinking about making a move here perhaps, with distribution shown not the worst hand he could have|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wiki: Linden is sitting like stone I think he moved once in 1973 in bridge table but we were playing night robber that time|pg||
nt|zebutin: with any other lead atleast 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|wiki: and he smiled once in 1984 / he is a real poker face|pg||
nt|kaapo:  I try to fetch the bronze match result also|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but still east doesnt know about the vasted king of clubs|pg||
nt|minimeck: opposite a min still throws in the towell|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so after all the choice to pass was  alittle lucky|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch overtaken  and a trump back |pg||
nt|ady: not easy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|minimeck: indeed, could have been cold if he had the diamond king, decided wasn't going to go fishing for that|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but a nice system they play|pg||
nt|minimeck: ARG URU will have to regroup after this match, now tetering on the q-zone|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: in nat system you need a jacoby 2 notrump for those hands|pg||
pc|d3|nt|zebutin: no x, N is just happy that for once opponents are playing in her (?) 6 card suit|pg||
nt|ady: got the right idea|pg||
pc|dA|nt|minimeck: plenty of tricks here, i rekon usa wouldn't mind a few flat boards to walk out with 22 VP|pg||
nt|minimeck: almost impossible to do that in practice, risk going down when normalish breaks can be cold|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|penseur9: here we go :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: play should go relatively quickly here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  that's actually the wrong way to play hearts with known long spades in East|pg||
pc|s2|nt|minimeck: will trust pard's carding now for -1|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wiki: so S  will be here ok for 2 down I think|pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile, italy escape on the previous board, as declarer tried to drop the stiff king offside and went -1 in 3@s x|pg||
nt|minimeck: 9 instead of 16|pg||

mb|p|nt|wiki: two boards here so it will be  time for winning moves I suppose  Paganus is going to have 10 in the last board|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam EW anyone?|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  3 nt has a fighting chance|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 sp?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|runnerup: a slam here 3 options -6 @d best|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that should deter them|pg||
nt|petka: a splinter diamonds is nice, but S would rather see a splinter spades :) Still, all those aces and the bonus J and JT are tempting|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very thin game E/W maybe 3NT better|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: right Markku|pg||
nt|zebutin: with 1@S you get to tell 5-5 quite easily|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, a quiet 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard bids anything,  I hit the deck with S |pg||
nt|ady: part score hand   likely 2 spades|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ianmcc: 3@s is ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: i must say i would blast 4@H with @S hand now...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, not much option with such shape & non reversible values anyway|pg||
nt|zebutin: i think nyberg told 8+ with @C suit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|zebutin: with 2@D that is|pg||
nt|petka: scandinavian style that shows extras with diamond splinter. Hard to stop below 5 if this is such a bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Would you raise 2@h to 3 vul, Matt?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wiki: looks like 5 imps more so 2 imps still and a nice board coming next|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns in bidding and ew quite lazy|pg||
nt|petka: I guess not|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2???????|pg||
nt|sybarra: whoaaaaaaaaaaa |pg||
nt|sybarra: optimism??? |pg||
nt|minimeck: opp my p's 14 16 no, but perhaps|pg||
nt|bebechira: i was thinking flat as 620 flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 5 Ok anyway|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  I think they have one loser in every suit in 4h|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  in d even 2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2 in @d?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: now Pete has to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  Shirley, you can't (should not) pass partner in a possible 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Way too high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: West could have the hand he actually has.|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S? - I was just between 2@s and 3@S :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: either 5@S or 5@C make, anything over 5@S is little tougher...|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: we have lost some specs to spingold  /  why |pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@H = 4@S for me...not 4@H...|pg||
nt|ady: I was well out|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|zebutin: just say i had couple @H mixed with my @S suit if partner asks...|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h also ok, helps pd make a choice if opps bid further|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was passing any 2 level bid,  maybe I am the old fogey here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|play4fun55:  2 losers in the d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 0 in @s|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  true|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so this is a good contract but finesses don't work|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petka: a popular style is 3C=minimum, 3D=extras with no splinter, 3H=club splinter, 3S=diamond splinter etc|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, you are better positioned after 4@H if opponents bid on|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand opponents know more about your hand, which might affect defence...so everything has upside and downside...|pg||
nt|minimeck: cailau decides to call it a day in 3h, will make 4 with the ace of @s luckily onside|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder why N did not bid 2NT over 2@S.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|zebutin: most likely defence will take their 2 @H tricks|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But, maybe Juniors lacking experience get excited when they see a lot of points.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|wiki: 4 @S is not bad contract but...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  You look for a 4-3 major by bidding 2@h over 2@d|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|wiki: played by east I think it could be on|pg||
nt|zebutin: and after that declarer just tests spades and clubs and claims|pg||
nt|zebutin: Latvians did well to reach 6@H at deal number 7 on other table too, so no swing for Finland|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|penseur9: this should prove costly for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok sure  and hope he plays 2 @S |pg||
nt|minimeck: we will see how emmons views the south hand, he has been extremely agressive thus far|pg||
pc|d6|nt|play4fun55:  since they use transfers over 1 club, would not a jump to 3 nt by East be a reasonable way of giving W a choice between 3 nt and 4 h ?|pg||
nt|pelu: we are not juniors, Valerie :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Which serves them well in other areas of bidding.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Ni, sigh, unfortunately..|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: No|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|pelu: @HA and @H = safe for 9, the winning chance is @DKQ stiff, |pg||
pc|dA|nt|minimeck: with 6-4 he wanted to show the clubs, k10 and stiff ace, can't blame him|pg||
nt|ady: this may scrape home with spades 3-3   |pg||
nt|ady: now 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|wiki: no, it cannot be made when @D is singelton |pg||
nt|kaapo:  Last two boards underway. Thanks Wiki for comments (and that no-one called Wiki so that he was free to commentate) and Anni for operating! :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|play4fun55:  both E/W has hands that are nt orientated|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|wiki: yes, nobody calls me  unfortunately, but happy to be here also|pg||
nt|ady: Turkey may have a swing here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|henryb:  If he raises to 3@h, partner will accept|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: so Shadyro gaining needed imps...still 18imps behind, which is much...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|exerdar: also overtrick |pg||
pc|h3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|pc|d7|nt|pelu: ok down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: sorry, north has discarted a @h before, over 3rd round in @s|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: south may get squeezed  for 10 tr4icks|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: about to run out of tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|henryb:  why did he ruff with the @hA?|pg||
nt|minimeck: roughing the ace seems pretty odd there, anyways, another possible pickup for the stars & stripes|pg||
mc|10|pg||

Here both teams are in that region, and it is a tied match :)|pg||

nt|runnerup: @d was never even mensioned|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: EW are playing precision NS are playing natural|pg||
nt|psyck: Auni missed game on board 12, which will narrow gap|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes...thats the question on the lips of the nation|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last hand of this set |pg||
nt|minimeck: will see if harrison is tilted enough to open 2h here :x|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: lol:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: certainly not an auto-1@s at those colors, with only k9xxx|pg||
nt|minimeck: rare to find a junior who passes a 12 count these days|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: here 3 clubs should not make|pg||
nt|minimeck: last board of the set here, a tight match |pg||
nt|minimeck: lunch break for the players after this round, next set scheduled to resume in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|gsper:  Seems a quiet board, though I know people who would get too high in @S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: they weren't very "precised" in previous hand :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h no good here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: next match starts in 50 minutes. if our commentators are available, pls let me know. thx|pg||
nt|bebechira: ruffing with the ace of hearts was spectacular but inefficient|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|minimeck: really? seems 4 for the defense to me|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session     thx all thx specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: might just go 1nt float|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wiki: Paganus already won the Cup of Finland this week so they are hot seniors|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like 4 @h but ..|pg||
nt|penseur9: easy to get in trouble here|pg||
nt|petka: I am informed that in norway the 2NT response system i outlined is not very popular, so 3S is still an unknown|pg||
mb|2C!|an|majors|nt|runnerup: north considering pass/3nt / 4 @h|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|penseur9: standings just updated at http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/rig11/invitational/rig11invr.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: so score difference will be in single digit...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now that's interesting|pg||
nt|minimeck: club or heart lead best from percario, but 7 tricks all day long either way|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C    showing majors|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|d|nt|zebutin: 2@H seem to be maximum for E/W|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Henry, Matt and Traian,   |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: right  imeant 130 should not be allowes sorry|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our operator !  great job |pg||
nt|minimeck: pleasure as always, both USA teams very well positioned out of the gates, the competition will continue to be very stiff at the top of the swiss|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: ty :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Fabio will also look to see Italy 1 remain very strong as well :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Great job Fabio,  we know we will see you through out the week |pg||
nt|exerdar: 2nt lebenshol  >>3@c auto|pg||
nt|ady: or as suggest 2NT  leb  |pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: (not that he would ever lead a heart) this will give an uptrick for france|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: no p - and if S has to play @D then @D9 well placed for decl|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mrdct: 5@d probably 2 down with no entry to south to take a @d finesse|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3@d now to play|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have 9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ady: north will not settle for 3@D   has done well not to get overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: I think Linde can take his 9 so congrats to Paganus again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: open room did well to stop in 3@h|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: west may get a @d trick promoted|pg||
mb|4S|nt|zebutin: this doesn't seem to be enough gain still...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, unfortunately not|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry 3@H... though 3nt is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Looks like there are 10 winners in @hs, 3 5 1 1. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Actually 11 with the long @h in e.|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal, finals starting in maybe 15 minutes|pg||
nt|minimeck: hope to see everyone back for the next set, very tight still in the Q zone, should be very exciting!|pg||
nt|gsper:  Can that @D4 have been suit preference, or was it just another card?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: rock and hard place for declarer here|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting choice here|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also specs,  always fun to hear from you |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Apparently Japan received a 1 VP penalty at the start of this match - perhaps late arrival at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: well|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting, that would be very suprising to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: 1st round well commented at my table|pg||
nt|minimeck: 1nt, however, can be set :) |pg||
nt|ady: no reason for south to have bid 1 more   has bid his values|pg||

nt|play4fun55:  should just scramble home|pg||
pc|cK|nt|janhamhurg: so some imps back|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: if he doesn't draw trumps east gets a @c ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: y|pg||
pc|c4|nt|blum1956: Yes, LAtvia is in 2@s on board 10 which surely makes (@sA lead). Congratulations Latvia!|pg||
nt|psyck: no scope to recover here, so it will be Latvia-Finland final|pg||
nt|blum1956: So Kauko Koistinen - Clas Nyberg (winners of the invitational pairs) and Ugis Jansons (runner-up) secured more medals (this time in teams)|pg||
nt|mrdct: south may have done better to play @c5 to mask east's count|pg||
