nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|doks: Hi all, wellcome back to Jurmala, Teams tournament finals Latvia-Finland|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|doks: NS from Latvia playing strong club|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|runnerup: balance or no balance ---no need|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 3@S if they guess everything|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: The defense has trick in each suit and possibly another in spades|pg||
nt|runnerup: no chance here atleast after this lead|pg||
nt|psyck: will make 2 in practice|pg||
nt|doks: team Latvia win semifinall vs Lithuania/Nederlands team with 12 IMP margin, Team Finland wins very convincingly|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: it was a very aggresive try esp for an NV game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|runnerup: ofcause after @d lead there could have been some littel hope|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|bagman: Veksa starting to set up the side suit; a sound priciple with a two suiter and so-so trump suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup: but very stange to ruff partners winner|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bagman: Patana Granström play 3rd/5th leads; by leading the 9 and following with the 10, E showed one more high card -> Patana should not have ruffed (on the other hand, E could have ...|pg||
nt|bagman: played the @CQ)|pg||

nt|psyck: the preemption seems to have worked other table with some overbidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: for me 4@H seem little stretched|pg||
nt|psyck: it indeed was|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@S is 8-11|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you in croatia Matt?|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is a junior tournament, so expect alot of fireworks here, both pairs are pretty agressive :|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: and 4+ cards unbalanced (or 5+ balanced)|pg||
nt|minimeck: today is actually my birthday, 26 now too old :x|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
mb|1H|nt|zebutin: so Koistinen has maximum for their bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|minimeck: it's ok, time for our young stars for their chance in the spotlight|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: will play 3@h undoubled here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought you might be close to the "edge" |pg||
mb|2D|nt|zebutin: this most likely goes 3 or so down, so small pickup for Finland|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is pretty much a cake walk for declarer,  not much to say |pg||
nt|minimeck: While this appears to be a flat four hearts, NS in the open room got a bit carried away, are now rotting in 4@s x , which appears to be 5 or 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: balanced 7points (essentially 6 with Jxx in @D) isn't usually something you want to bid 4with against partners t/o double, even though partner does have short @D...|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|minimeck: given we have a nice close nit group here (few kibs so far) feel free to message with questions or comments :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: loosing 2 @S @H and @C  or two|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi valerie westheimer :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi Murat|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hopefully we will get the names up soon|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I mean so we can click on them|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: at the other table N bid only 2@D at first, and when partner raised to 3@D found more from pre-emptive hand and bid 4@D...|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have opened 3@d too|pg||
pc|c3|nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks quite hard decision to defende 1 @d .instead of play some @s or nt -contract|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s no hope here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vdoubleu: No p;ay here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vdoubleu: play|pg||
nt|MolvaM: welcome to peter lund|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|runnerup: ok|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: @h9 should have alerted dec to the trump position|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Well he stole 1 trick|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wiki: @H ruff possible|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: don't particularly like the @h9 play but N had a tough guess on what to play. Declarer should have probably started @c after winning @hK|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C suit has some chances for defence too... if S ducks couple times with A, might be enough to make Jansons finese @C 10|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: pls who is where - the flags are wrong?|pg||
nt|minimeck: at the other table for the US we have a very young pair in their first international competition, the pressure of the worldwide audience is not easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: the rest of kibbers do not know what they are missing,  I find the jrs. and youth tourneys much more fun|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wiki: now she is ok fo 9 |pg||

nt|zebutin: so AUNI takes the early lead with small pickup|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Traian :) |pg||
nt|bebechira: Pete and Shane are a relative new partnership|pg||
nt|minimeck: welcome Traian|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: id call that lucky 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: @c lead needed here ( from KJ( to beat 4 @s maybe |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1@C is 15-17nt or 12-16 unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
mb|1D|nt|minimeck: indeed, :) needed the trump suit to cooperate there. they will take it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be this will end in 1 spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: both tables chose 1N to 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|MolvaM: opatija fotos http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.230364477010280.54898.224083290971732|pg||
mb|1H|nt|penseur9: Hi Markkhu|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt on a @s lead here appears doomed|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Edgettons in the open room are superstars in our part of the world...|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: usually not 6th club in 1nt, but tells strength quite closely, and shape not too much off...|pg||
nt|minimeck: appears they failed to find the club shift on board 21 so first blood to the americans|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|wiki: EW is bidding very differently in open and closed as close open all 8 or more|pg||
nt|zebutin: not even singelton or two|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both ok |pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, will be interesting to see if east raises to 2|pg||
nt|minimeck: do EW play a strong club variant of some sort (with limited openings)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Koistinen knows that 16 is max for Nyberg... but must have something good for jump to 3@H in zone|pg||
nt|bebechira: Nabil will play in Veldhoven in the open team... the youngest ever :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|minimeck: an interesting trend in junior qualifiers recently, going to 10 board round robin / swiss matches, very few boards with a world championship on the line, :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
mb|2C|nt|runnerup: hi Andre'|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They seem to be getting too hugh here|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They can bail out at 4@c & make that|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to stop with 16 opp 8|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: True|pg||
nt|minimeck: and a practical 2@c bid here by lankveld, will find a very nice place to play |pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: No, but probably 1@s is limited|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: 1@d is better minor|pg||
nt|minimeck: grazie mille Fabio @h we are in good hands with our operator this morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: so well bid on both rooms, might be imp difference for either way, if declarer just takes 6@C+@H+@D+@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|zebutin: or if defender tosses 1 diamond away, declarer fineses and takes 6@C, @S, @H , 3@D|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this 12 board semifinal will play one of the Finnish teams in the 12 board Finals to follow after this.|pg||
nt|zebutin: or declarer can double finese in @D, but I honestly don't see that happening...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he lead kindly but still should fail|pg||
nt|bebechira: not a lot of room to "recover"  if you make a mistake :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: :) I hope for you :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: But if they get to game (in clubs) probably the heart lead has been pin pointed now.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: A lot of work to do here, in 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: hard gamble by W|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: This might help|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i must admit i had passed out 1 spade|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ianmcc: pls change names - these are last tim's|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|zebutin: after opponents have bid @D as their suit, Nyberg might have void in that, so @D A isnt pulling all the weight it could be...so disciplined pass|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @S return still 3 tricks coming for defence, which would be 7 imps for finland|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will have 10 rounds of Swiss... and then QF,SF and F|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, Maximo really decided to simply deny them the contract with the balancing 1nt here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but 3 clubs is a very nice spot|pg||
nt|minimeck: certainly a stretch but that is their overall style of bidding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|janhamhurg: cash 2 spades and crossruff 6 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|minimeck: QF and SF 3 16 board segments, with a final of 4 14 board segments and (3rd place playoff of 3 segemnts) at least they went to all day matches for the semis and quarterfinals|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: didn't N see the bidding - on their way to 3Nt buit no @H-stop|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|cT|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vdoubleu: South was on lead, &, apparently not.|pg||
nt|pelu: W didn't accept the help (3x@D) and disc a @h|pg||
pc|c6|nt|runnerup: @h guess needed and done|pg||
pc|c4|nt|minimeck: it is also interesting to note only 27 teams entered the event as opposed to 40 in istanbul, I was somewhat suprised by the decreased attendence given the location in europe|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ianmcc: switch also kind|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, should be a quick 9 here :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|penseur9: very well done by Neimanis|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: but perhaps he heart me say 8 insteadt of 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 1@C 2+ as I remember correctly|pg||
nt|bagman: EW open 1@C even with 3-3-5-2 if outside their NT range|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|doks: no flat 4333 boards here, only swing boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: 1@H transfer showing 4+ spades|pg||
nt|runnerup: now easyer for ew to come to @s than after some jump in @d ,but north was too strong|pg||
nt|bagman: S wants to pass|pg||
mb|2N|nt|runnerup: and overbid by ns again 3. in a row|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: Is S allowed to pass now?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|runnerup: like they bid -some breaks needed|pg||

nt|bagman: he took some time to work that out|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|psyck: happy to get an entry, but either side suits needs to be played twice towards to set up extra trick|pg||

nt|bebechira: i will be in Veldhoven though :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: will EW find their @D fit?|pg||
nt|minimeck: spectator raises the issue of the economy as a possible reason, very true, I personally know of a few teams who had to go to the extreme in terms of raising funds to go*|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: slam for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: this table playing much faster than other table, they have almost taken the 2 deal lead up, so soon no comparisons from this table...|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 losers in 4@h/@s|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|play4fun55:  a good 4 h e/w|pg||
nt|minimeck: and the Netherlands will win 5 back as EW in the open bid their way up to 2nt |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: anyone 2 dia here?|pg||
nt|minimeck: they open very light, i would imagine Garcia da rosa not liking his options here, i predict a shoulder shrugging pass|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 12 imps is alot for winning 3 clubs...|pg||
nt|minimeck: not the best discarding by ferro, came down to K10 of diamonds allowed them to run both suits|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 down is a havy disaster|pg||
mb|1N|nt|runnerup: now i douth it|pg||

nt|vugraphzmy: west said: wow!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bebechira: well said Matt... 27 teams... a very disapointing number for a world event......|pg||
nt|minimeck: should arrive at 4s here, after the 2@c multi purpose GF|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be interesting with the 4-0|pg||
nt|minimeck: and another very bold balancing NT here by NS|pg||
pc|h6|nt|runnerup: 3nt looks down in practice @h lead,,-while 5 or even 6 @d -open cards are on|pg||
nt|bebechira: but we entered 2 teams... so this shows that we are doing very well.....lol...|pg||
nt|minimeck: throwing all caution into the wind :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|zebutin: declarer could maybe get 9 tricks for all important imp, but most likely going to be even board|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi ian :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi traian|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Here comes the spade 8 on the track.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: do you like it?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|zebutin: at first seems like declarer is losing @H, @C and 2 @D, but we will see how this developes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|minimeck: yes, two strong teams at that :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: our goal is 1st and 2nd place|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb:  shouldn't be that difficult: five side winners and cross ruff away|pg||
nt|minimeck: do they also have the rule here regarding semifinals and two teams from the same country (as with the bermuda bowl and USA1/2)?|pg||
nt|bebechira: good point , lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably|pg||
nt|minimeck: will hit the jackpot, however, with p's double heart stopper, to me personally the risk seems far greater than the reward|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: sooner or later we will have one big board which will decide the match :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bebechira: i will give a link with a teriffic youtube video made by Maz ( east here)|pg||

nt|pelu: @s7 for @D - I was not sure that East could see that @s8 was a singleton|pg||
nt|minimeck: I completely agree, especially when pard will open most all 11s in their strong club system|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wiki: Linden is  now very conservative / not bidding 2 @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: East started smiling and said that N wanted them to play 1NT.... N said no with a smile..... 3NT :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: atleast Koistinen is honest...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|zebutin: now most likely takes 1 round of spades and tries @H ruff...|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|minimeck: in the previous event Tebha represented pakistan, following in Zia's footsteps now with the USA|pg||
nt|minimeck: ARG URU, really showing an agressive intent in these matches we have seen so far, yesterday against japan they recieved a speeding ticket on the first board |pg||
pc|s3|nt|zebutin: now with @C finese could thros @H to strong @C|pg||
nt|zebutin: if it would work that is...with this distribution would make this go one more down...|pg||

nt|ianmcc: very cheap slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Aussies playing this event with 2 teams|pg||
nt|ianmcc: both very good teams|pg||

nt|minimeck: i do like the choice made at the other table however, with a 3rd seat opener of 1d, that seems much more preferable to the balance|pg||

mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: 4 hearts makes on a spade lead, but will be difficult on a dia or a cl lead|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|penseur9: a strong @H contract here for EW|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cards lie well for 3NT|pg||

mb|2H|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He should play all to make this and will.|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: E/W got this one cheap, might even make, or @D H lead making comfortably...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt seems like normal spot to be in, might have some difficulties with entries for @C, but when @D 10 drops has always sure entry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might need a good guess  in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you fond of 2 nt with W?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|wiki: 6 @C is on and  needs 1/1 clubs  which is odds or @h finesse  also you can try to get cover on @DQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: Juzz has a very good feel at the table.... i think he will make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not - perhaps a discard on @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: 2 aces and a trump|pg||
nt|bebechira: in theory lol|pg||
mb|3H|nt|runnerup: previos hand number 2 both rooms made 4 @s -which should have been beaten -no guess in @h helps if south takes his ace and playes a small @c to his partner to play @s |pg||
nt|penseur9: the lead will decide how many extra tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ianmcc: this helps. Now the discard a real possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: 3nt a good spot on this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|bebechira: 10 boards matches... not a lot of boards to recover the bad ones :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: 3 no looks fine|pg||
nt|minimeck: and indeed that is where they will play it :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: lol your lead:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: i expect a spade lead here from west, although he has some choices, no winning options :p|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wiki: I thin 4 @D is splinter|pg||
nt|wiki: luckily we have very qualified operator|pg||
nt|minimeck: although a diamond is more logical|pg||
nt|minimeck: given the fact if his partner had any real spades he likely would have opened in 3rd seat|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|penseur9: we're back|pg||
nt|zebutin: cards sitting extremely well for E/W, so @H making 11 tricks if they play at it|pg||

mb|1N|nt|zebutin: 4@C most likely Namyats,promising foor hand in @H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: this deal will extend the lead significantly|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like defence could get 2@S, @C, @D, @H in 5@D, so they might have slipped a little|pg||

nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 spade is ok now i thk|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting choice of 3@d here, pumping the pot to make it tougher on north|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: vulnerable 3 dia is perfekt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ianmcc: 4@h a chance for E/W|pg||

nt|sybarra: and never mind the vulnerability |pg||
nt|minimeck: but certainly no clear options here, besides a blast, spec offers 5c?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|wiki: par contract / NS can make 2 @S|pg||
nt|bebechira: ace of clubs lead in the open room.... gave the vikings 12 back :(|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Not much of one--a heart suit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it shows a distributional hand so pd can act as here well done|pg||
nt|minimeck: max pressure now by Bos, hard for south to restrain himself|pg||
nt|minimeck: the decision by HOP to show a GF hand here paid off|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|pelu: a LAW bid from S - and as u see with both red kings onside easy 4@H by EW|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But no one can bid, really.|pg||

nt|minimeck: very interesting how pre-empts work sometimes, by not raising to 4h, drodge only bid 3@s (could have bid 4), so south just gave up|pg||
pc|h9|nt|zebutin: this seem to make as stated earlier, so Finland most likely wont lose imps on this one...|pg||

mb|p|nt|wiki: Linden is sitting like stone I think he moved once in 1973 in bridge table but we were playing night robber that time|pg||

nt|runnerup: @d was never even mensioned|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: EW are playing precision NS are playing natural|pg||
nt|psyck: Auni missed game on board 12, which will narrow gap|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes...thats the question on the lips of the nation|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last hand of this set |pg||
nt|minimeck: will see if harrison is tilted enough to open 2h here :x|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: lol:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: certainly not an auto-1@s at those colors, with only k9xxx|pg||
nt|minimeck: rare to find a junior who passes a 12 count these days|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: here 3 clubs should not make|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: they weren't very "precised" in previous hand :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h no good here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: next match starts in 50 minutes. if our commentators are available, pls let me know. thx|pg||
nt|bebechira: ruffing with the ace of hearts was spectacular but inefficient|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|minimeck: really? seems 4 for the defense to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|wiki: Paganus already won the Cup of Finland this week so they are hot seniors|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like 4 @h but ..|pg||
nt|penseur9: easy to get in trouble here|pg||
nt|petka: I am informed that in norway the 2NT response system i outlined is not very popular, so 3S is still an unknown|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: north considering pass/3nt / 4 @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: standings just updated at http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/rig11/invitational/rig11invr.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: so score difference will be in single digit...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now that's interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 2@H seem to be maximum for E/W|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Henry, Matt and Traian,   |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: right  imeant 130 should not be allowes sorry|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our operator !  great job |pg||
nt|minimeck: pleasure as always, both USA teams very well positioned out of the gates, the competition will continue to be very stiff at the top of the swiss|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: ty :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Fabio will also look to see Italy 1 remain very strong as well :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Great job Fabio,  we know we will see you through out the week |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|pelu: no p - and if S has to play @D then @D9 well placed for decl|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d probably 2 down with no entry to south to take a @d finesse|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wiki: I think Linde can take his 9 so congrats to Paganus again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: open room did well to stop in 3@h|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: west may get a @d trick promoted|pg||
pc|d6|nt|zebutin: this doesn't seem to be enough gain still...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, unfortunately not|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry 3@H... though 3nt is interesting|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: Looks like there are 10 winners in @hs, 3 5 1 1. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Actually 11 with the long @h in e.|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal, finals starting in maybe 15 minutes|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mrdct: rock and hard place for declarer here|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting choice here|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also specs,  always fun to hear from you |pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  Apparently Japan received a 1 VP penalty at the start of this match - perhaps late arrival at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: well|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting, that would be very suprising to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: 1st round well commented at my table|pg||
nt|minimeck: 1nt, however, can be set :) |pg||
pc|s5|pc|dQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|zebutin: didn't see that one coming, but seems that has 4@H+4@D + couple @S tricks....opponents can take 2@C + 2 aces when ever...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just 8|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  should just scramble home|pg||
pc|c2|nt|janhamhurg: so some imps back|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mrdct: if he doesn't draw trumps east gets a @c ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: y|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|blum1956: Yes, LAtvia is in 2@s on board 10 which surely makes (@sA lead). Congratulations Latvia!|pg||
nt|psyck: no scope to recover here, so it will be Latvia-Finland final|pg||
nt|blum1956: So Kauko Koistinen - Clas Nyberg (winners of the invitational pairs) and Ugis Jansons (runner-up) secured more medals (this time in teams)|pg||
nt|mrdct: south may have done better to play @c5 to mask east's count|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good|pg||
nt|mrdct: but justin howard has read it|pg||
nt|minimeck: this will make with the club positioning|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wiki: it takes a momen finding clubs 3  0 but  he can do it|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mrdct: possible 14 imps for Australia now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wiki: hoping that def throws some @Ds to get one @S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  I am not fond of Brescoll's auction. 3N over 3@d would seem to be indicated|pg||
pc|hT|nt|zebutin: wd for E/W|pg||
nt|zebutin: not so easy to stop in 3nt when you have 8 card major fit and 3-1 in other major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: club lead beats 3 nt|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, not so easy to find one from AQxx though|pg||
nt|zebutin: this table is ready, so thanks for all for watching|pg||
