mb|1S|mb|4H|nt|mrdct: west has several ways of raising @h here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mrdct: but a direct 4@h bid conveys his hand well|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 4@s will be a tad expensive|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was a bit on the ridiculous side at these colours|pg||
nt|mrdct: possibly 800|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: if it really was south who bid it all on his own|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north really bid it over 4@H?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|athene: if partner comes down with four trumps and a stiff in their suit and it's still wrong - i think you are bidding his cards AND your own and borrowing some from the next table as ...|pg||
nt|athene: well|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: i'm not sure who is whom but the edgtton brothers are adam and nabil|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mrdct: nabil is the younger brother but the first of the two to make the australian open team|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S over 1@H describes the south hand quite well i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: both are studying commerce at the university of wollongong (just south of sydney)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they play that as fit-showing or something, though|pg||

nt|psyck: the preemption seems to have worked other table with some overbidding|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|zebutin: for me 4@H seem little stretched|pg||
nt|psyck: it indeed was|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@S is 8-11|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you in croatia Matt?|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is a junior tournament, so expect alot of fireworks here, both pairs are pretty agressive :|pg||
mb|1S|nt|zebutin: and 4+ cards unbalanced (or 5+ balanced)|pg||
nt|minimeck: today is actually my birthday, 26 now too old :x|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
mb|4H|nt|zebutin: so Koistinen has maximum for their bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: it's ok, time for our young stars for their chance in the spotlight|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: will play 3@h undoubled here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought you might be close to the "edge" |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|zebutin: this most likely goes 3 or so down, so small pickup for Finland|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is pretty much a cake walk for declarer,  not much to say |pg||
nt|minimeck: While this appears to be a flat four hearts, NS in the open room got a bit carried away, are now rotting in 4@s x , which appears to be 5 or 800|pg||
pc|d4|nt|zebutin: balanced 7points (essentially 6 with Jxx in @D) isn't usually something you want to bid 4with against partners t/o double, even though partner does have short @D...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|minimeck: given we have a nice close nit group here (few kibs so far) feel free to message with questions or comments :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wiki: loosing 2 @S @H and @C  or two|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: at the other table N bid only 2@D at first, and when partner raised to 3@D found more from pre-emptive hand and bid 4@D...|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have opened 3@d too|pg||
pc|sT|nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks quite hard decision to defende 1 @d .instead of play some @s or nt -contract|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|runnerup: ok|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|c2|nt|psyck: don't particularly like the @h9 play but N had a tough guess on what to play. Declarer should have probably started @c after winning @hK|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C suit has some chances for defence too... if S ducks couple times with A, might be enough to make Jansons finese @C 10|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|ianmcc: pls who is where - the flags are wrong?|pg||
nt|minimeck: at the other table for the US we have a very young pair in their first international competition, the pressure of the worldwide audience is not easy|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: difficult for East|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: not an attractive @c holding to lead from|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but after the @DK maybe he can work out that clubs are going on diamonds in the fullness of time|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: and so a club shift probably won't hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT is touch and go here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: not easy because if declarer had the @CQ and not the @DJ, the club shift would cost|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S is a range ask i assume|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mrdct: 2@s looks like a range probe|pg||
nt|athene: north bids 2nt with minimum and 3@C with max|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so you can use it with a normal 2nt invitation or various club hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or even a 4nt sort of hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct: 2NT is generally an unpopular contract|pg||

nt|zebutin: so AUNI takes the early lead with small pickup|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Traian :) |pg||
nt|bebechira: Pete and Shane are a relative new partnership|pg||
nt|minimeck: welcome Traian|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: @c lead needed here ( from KJ( to beat 4 @s maybe |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1@C is 15-17nt or 12-16 unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|psyck: both tables chose 1N to 2@c overcall|pg||
mb|2C!|an|majors|nt|penseur9: Hi Markkhu|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt on a @s lead here appears doomed|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Edgettons in the open room are superstars in our part of the world...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|zebutin: usually not 6th club in 1nt, but tells strength quite closely, and shape not too much off...|pg||
nt|minimeck: appears they failed to find the club shift on board 21 so first blood to the americans|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wiki: EW is bidding very differently in open and closed as close open all 8 or more|pg||
nt|zebutin: not even singelton or two|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both ok |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Koistinen knows that 16 is max for Nyberg... but must have something good for jump to 3@H in zone|pg||
nt|bebechira: Nabil will play in Veldhoven in the open team... the youngest ever :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|minimeck: an interesting trend in junior qualifiers recently, going to 10 board round robin / swiss matches, very few boards with a world championship on the line, :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|runnerup: hi Andre'|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: so well bid on both rooms, might be imp difference for either way, if declarer just takes 6@C+@H+@D+@S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if defender tosses 1 diamond away, declarer fineses and takes 6@C, @S, @H , 3@D|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this 12 board semifinal will play one of the Finnish teams in the 12 board Finals to follow after this.|pg||
nt|zebutin: or declarer can double finese in @D, but I honestly don't see that happening...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he lead kindly but still should fail|pg||
nt|bebechira: not a lot of room to "recover"  if you make a mistake :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ianmcc: pls change names - these are last tim's|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|zebutin: after opponents have bid @D as their suit, Nyberg might have void in that, so @D A isnt pulling all the weight it could be...so disciplined pass|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @S return still 3 tricks coming for defence, which would be 7 imps for finland|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will have 10 rounds of Swiss... and then QF,SF and F|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|minimeck: QF and SF 3 16 board segments, with a final of 4 14 board segments and (3rd place playoff of 3 segemnts) at least they went to all day matches for the semis and quarterfinals|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|athene: yes, surely|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has lots of top tricks, just leads a heart to the king and makes lots of tricks|pg||

mb|d|nt|ryskiel_: .|pg||
nt|athene: south wondering what "redouble" says now :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: although EW might be looking for blood now|pg||
nt|athene: does it say "help!" or "gotcha!"?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: if you didn't discuss it with partner no earlier than 20 minutes before the session, don't try it, south!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@hx likely now|pg||
nt|athene: east will raise spades next|pg||
nt|athene: no way he will sit for a double of 2@H with undisclosed *four* card support for the overcall|pg||
nt|athene: and the way it will tempo out, west will never get a chance to double hearts anyway before east raises, i think|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: north may bid 2@d on the way through|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe east should have raised spades immediately rather than doubling - he knows he isn't going to defend at the 2-level|pg||
nt|athene: taking the slow route can have advantages, though|pg||
nt|athene: east might have thought "partner is getting to play in spades, so i will let them bid a lot, so he knows how to play the hand"|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: if east just bashed in a strong spade raise (2nt or something) over 1nt then NS would learn less - but so would west|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: big misunderstanding for EW here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: 3@S perhaps a slight underbid|pg||
nt|athene: east got scared off a bit by the 1nt bid, telling him the spades were bad, maybe|pg||
nt|mrdct: east probably thought they were in a GF auction and was try to convey some extra values|pg||
nt|athene: hmm, i can't believe he thought 3@S was forcing?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: it's not as though he had @Sxxxx|pg||
nt|athene: when you might indeed be worried that you have a lot of spade losers after the 1nt call|pg||
nt|athene: i think he should just bid game|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|mrdct: partner made a vul overcall, i hit 1NT for blood and then the overcaller doubled 2@c - aren't we either going to defend a doubled contract or play in game?|pg||

nt|zebutin: to me 2 rounds of @S at that point seem stricly worse than just 1 round and play @H A + H (because if you get ruffed with last @S, you still have 1 @S in dummy to ruff last @H ...|pg||
nt|zebutin: with)|pg||
nt|zebutin: but wasn't really more at stake than 1 imp again...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very cheap slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Aussies playing this event with 2 teams|pg||
nt|ianmcc: both very good teams|pg||
nt|bebechira: this has to show the depth of our youth |pg||

mb|1C!|nt|MolvaM: the official event page http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/Opatija11.htm|pg||

mb|1H|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|bebechira: the cheap slam scored 13 for us :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|penseur9: a strong @H contract here for EW|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cards lie well for 3NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: not sure if EW have changed their NT ranges, would have expected a 2nt opener from brescoll here, 1@c will work much better :p|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: E/W got this one cheap, might even make, or @D H lead making comfortably...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt seems like normal spot to be in, might have some difficulties with entries for @C, but when @D 10 drops has always sure entry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might need a good guess  in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you fond of 2 nt with W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: 6 @C is on and  needs 1/1 clubs  which is odds or @h finesse  also you can try to get cover on @DQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: Juzz has a very good feel at the table.... i think he will make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not - perhaps a discard on @d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bebechira: 2 aces and a trump|pg||
nt|bebechira: in theory lol|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup: previos hand number 2 both rooms made 4 @s -which should have been beaten -no guess in @h helps if south takes his ace and playes a small @c to his partner to play @s |pg||
nt|penseur9: the lead will decide how many extra tricks|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this helps. Now the discard a real possibility|pg||

nt|vugraphzhm: For more information www.rigainvites.com|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They play a round of 4 deals, so now it is a break time, we will be back shortly|pg||
nt|runnerup: that @d fit 7-3 was found in other table -some help from defended ofcause by double to 3nt -spades badly|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: The players who were sitting NS at this table is a strong Latvian pair. They were 5th in Philadelphia in mixed pairs tournament|pg||

mb|3H|nt|athene: maybe the 4@H bid actually helped NS along|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: i wonder if north would jump to 4@S if west passed the double? i guess he should|pg||
nt|mrdct: north's @hxxx are gold after partner shows a void @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west can't really get cute here, given the vulnerability|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: west pushed the boat out in the closed room competing to 4@h|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|mrdct: west's pass here was a good choice as it denied north the opportunity to make a free bid|pg||

nt|athene: maybe 4@H should make it harder|pg||
nt|athene: if you assume north should bid 4@S on this auction|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: then clearly that is showing a good hand and south will bid slam|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: but after 4@H, maybe 4@S might be made on less than a jump to 4@S here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|athene: so i take back the comment about 4@H helping NS - i think this swing was Drodge's fault not Brescoll's|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|penseur9: we're back|pg||
nt|zebutin: cards sitting extremely well for E/W, so @H making 11 tricks if they play at it|pg||
nt|psyck: another good result for Latvia here|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like some misdef other room|pg||
nt|ianmcc: routine 4@s E/W|pg||
nt|minimeck: slam time NS|pg||
mb|d|nt|zebutin: 4@C most likely Namyats,promising foor hand in @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: this deal will extend the lead significantly|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like defence could get 2@S, @C, @D, @H in 5@D, so they might have slipped a little|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: a little :)|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: 4@h a chance for E/W|pg||

nt|sybarra: just looking,  can he handle everything?|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be simple to bid this one|pg||
nt|henryb:  May be hard after 3@hX4@h|pg||
nt|minimeck: with a free 4s from partner?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and never mind the vulnerability |pg||
nt|minimeck: but certainly no clear options here, besides a blast, spec offers 5c?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|wiki: par contract / NS can make 2 @S|pg||
nt|bebechira: ace of clubs lead in the open room.... gave the vikings 12 back :(|pg||

nt|bebechira: Shane in the tank...good sign or bad sign?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Its not that easy, Matt. Partner's A might be in @h|pg||
nt|minimeck: looking for grand|pg||
mb|6S|nt|zebutin: well, after @H lead defence was quite badly situationed|pg||
nt|psyck: they did well to x anyway, no so easy here|pg||
nt|zebutin: not many good returns from W|pg||
nt|zebutin: foor = good...|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: most likely making 10 tricks after finese of @C|pg||

nt|minimeck: on 24, edgtton not suprisingly does open 2nt as we discussed, might be more imps for the americans|pg||

pc|s2|nt|zebutin: Koistinen doesn't see fullgame even against maximum, so passed with decent hand, maybe getting nice penalty score...|pg||

nt|henryb:  and even then a @d shift will beat it easily|pg||

mb|1N|nt|kaapo:  I suppose "AV Maria" is pronounced Ave Maria (got it now) :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h made on  15|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how many nt does S bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: We have some Tuulas friends from Amsterdam here so maybe if you get some results you could tell also those|pg||
nt|henryb:  3 Shirley|pg||
mb|3N|nt|zebutin: 1@S not alerted? interesting choice with 109x only in @S...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt little lucky, but when @H 4-4 makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: @cQ max|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  14+17 < 33|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wiki: that is normal finnish michaels highest and one of the lower /  2 NT forcing |pg||
nt|sybarra: and basically yuckky with no running suit |pg||
pc|s7|nt|runnerup: 4 @h can be beaten 3nt looks ok |pg||

nt|play4fun55:  this will be a close encounter. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: @c9 only chance|pg||
pc|s4|nt|runnerup: even 4 @s down :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: 2@C maybe some gazilli variant, so 2@H denies 8+ or so hcp... |pg||
nt|psyck: EW play strong @c, so no gaz|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: it is a some kind of gazilli|pg||
nt|psyck: E just tried a tactical approach|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@C most likely puppet stayman and 3nt denying 4 or 5 card majors|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|penseur9: yes 3nt definitly best contract here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|runnerup: if red lead -ruff should be found|pg||
nt|zebutin: good lead, not everyones choice surely to lead from K98x to strong hand|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  j of spade in dummy is a golden card|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup: south declaring it helps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ianmcc: he'll likely scramble 8 trix|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|wiki: Linden is sitting like stone I think he moved once in 1973 in bridge table but we were playing night robber that time|pg||
nt|zebutin: with any other lead atleast 10 tricks for declarer|pg||

nt|mrdct: chance for USA here|pg||
nt|henryb:  But cold as the cards lie|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: i guess he decided there was no point inviting as partner would not know when his cards were fitting well |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: need to chase these vul games|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mrdct: but you need to make them too|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mrdct: and 4@h might make here on some lines|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I would pass as S, but its close|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @sJ10 coming down is helpful for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H in this sequence used to be very strong - basically saying "bid game unless you psyched 1@H"|pg||
nt|mrdct: but equally declarer may take restricted choice in @s|pg||
nt|athene: but these days more people use it lighter, sometimes just 13 or 14 count with a singleton|pg||
nt|athene: because they have other strong heart raises available|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it shows about what N has: a useful 17 count with four card trump support|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting that NS play 1@c:1@h as natural - i don't think i've seen anyone in this event using that treatment|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: these thin games on 4-4 major fit are really tricky to play and defend|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace basically make their living slipping these 22, 23 count 4@H/4@S contracts through the slips|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

nt|athene: that club finesse is not one you want to take unless it's the only chance....difficult|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|h2|nt|athene: i like the club ruff and diamond up a bit more, or even just lead the @DK to preserve some options|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: now south is getting his @H5 drawn before he can get to dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: always the danger in a 4-4 fit - if you play trumps early and it goes wrong you find the defenders playing a killing third round|pg||
nt|mrdct: only if east finds the @d entry to west's hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||

nt|zebutin: 1@D 17+|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|zebutin: would you open 1@H or 1@S with S hand?|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@s|pg||
nt|ianmcc: ggod slam to be out of. I have hopes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wiki: two boards here so it will be  time for winning moves I suppose  Paganus is going to have 10 in the last board|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam EW anyone?|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  3 nt has a fighting chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: a slam here 3 options -6 @d best|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that should deter them|pg||
nt|petka: a splinter diamonds is nice, but S would rather see a splinter spades :) Still, all those aces and the bonus J and JT are tempting|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very thin game E/W maybe 3NT better|pg||
mb|2H|nt|penseur9: right Markku|pg||
nt|zebutin: with 1@S you get to tell 5-5 quite easily|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, a quiet 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard bids anything,  I hit the deck with S |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3@s is ?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|zebutin: i must say i would blast 4@H with @S hand now...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, not much option with such shape & non reversible values anyway|pg||
nt|zebutin: i think nyberg told 8+ with @C suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: with 2@D that is|pg||
nt|petka: scandinavian style that shows extras with diamond splinter. Hard to stop below 5 if this is such a bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Would you raise 2@h to 3 vul, Matt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: looks like 5 imps more so 2 imps still and a nice board coming next|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns in bidding and ew quite lazy|pg||
nt|petka: I guess not|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2???????|pg||
nt|sybarra: whoaaaaaaaaaaa |pg||
nt|sybarra: optimism??? |pg||
nt|minimeck: opp my p's 14 16 no, but perhaps|pg||
nt|bebechira: i was thinking flat as 620 flat|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ianmcc: 5 Ok anyway|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  I think they have one loser in every suit in 4h|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  in d even 2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2 in @d?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: now Pete has to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  Shirley, you can't (should not) pass partner in a possible 4-2 fit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|zebutin: either 5@S or 5@C make, anything over 5@S is little tougher...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wiki: we have lost some specs to spingold  /  why |pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@H = 4@S for me...not 4@H...|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|zebutin: just say i had couple @H mixed with my @S suit if partner asks...|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h also ok, helps pd make a choice if opps bid further|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was passing any 2 level bid,  maybe I am the old fogey here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|play4fun55:  2 losers in the d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 0 in @s|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  true|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so this is a good contract but finesses don't work|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petka: a popular style is 3C=minimum, 3D=extras with no splinter, 3H=club splinter, 3S=diamond splinter etc|pg||
pc|c8|nt|zebutin: yes, you are better positioned after 4@H if opponents bid on|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand opponents know more about your hand, which might affect defence...so everything has upside and downside...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|zebutin: most likely defence will take their 2 @H tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|h2|nt|wiki: 4 @S is not bad contract but...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  You look for a 4-3 major by bidding 2@h over 2@d|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|wiki: played by east I think it could be on|pg||
nt|zebutin: and after that declarer just tests spades and clubs and claims|pg||
nt|zebutin: Latvians did well to reach 6@H at deal number 7 on other table too, so no swing for Finland|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|penseur9: this should prove costly for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok sure  and hope he plays 2 @S |pg||
nt|minimeck: we will see how emmons views the south hand, he has been extremely agressive thus far|pg||
pc|s6|nt|play4fun55:  since they use transfers over 1 club, would not a jump to 3 nt by East be a reasonable way of giving W a choice between 3 nt and 4 h ?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|wiki: no, it cannot be made when @D is singelton |pg||

nt|athene: brescoll's 5@D a slightly odd decision|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: balanced hand, no obvious weak suits - you don't rush to 5 of a minor usually|pg||

nt|penseur9: easy to get in trouble here|pg||
nt|petka: I am informed that in norway the 2NT response system i outlined is not very popular, so 3S is still an unknown|pg||
mb|1S|nt|runnerup: north considering pass/3nt / 4 @h|pg||
mb|1N|nt|penseur9: standings just updated at http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/rig11/invitational/rig11invr.htm|pg||
