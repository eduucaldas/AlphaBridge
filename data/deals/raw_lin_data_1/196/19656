nt|Walddk2: Hi MM|pg||
mb|d|nt|minimeck: Turkey 3 did well to pull back 10 on the last board of the first segment, still a very close match here |pg||
nt|minimeck: :) lots of action boards in the first set, hope to see that continue, should be a routine 4@h here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some would open 3 or even 4@S with that south hand in third seat|pg||
nt|athene: with a pure 6-4|pg||
nt|minimeck: an interesting choice on these third seat major hands, a pre-empt seems best to make it tougher on opponents|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|ybob: un placer|pg||
nt|ferlema: bien gracias :)|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C perhaps denies three spades, hence alerted|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: wow.... |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D = apoyo @H mejor mano que apoyo directo|pg||
nt|gsper:  A modern style weak 2.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Good Morning everyone, we are now underway here in the quarterfinals :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this room is for turkish commentary|pg||
nt|atalok: slmlar|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: fireworks to start things off... here lankveld 6-4 in the majors blasts slam opposite bos' michaels, missing 2 cashing aces, |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H rechaza game|pg||
nt|exerdar: pass really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: it seems 4@sX -3 2@d 2@c 1@s and 1@h|pg||
nt|ferlema: 1@H double 2@D es tra to 2@H con un muy buen apoyo de 3 cartas|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hoþgeldin süleyman kolata|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: rare for auctions to die in 2 of a minor these days|pg||
nt|athene: but since neither side has a fit, i guess it's ok here :)|pg||
nt|athene: if east is really taking this long about his opening lead that tells declarer quite a bit about his hand i.e. he has a horrible hand to lead from!|pg||
nt|gsper:  That kind of bidding is supposed to call for trump lead, but here decl needs no ruffs.|pg||
nt|atalok: hbulduk paþam.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|minimeck: will likely find the shift here to set 6s, however, the other table, q@c lead allows 7@dx to roll home|pg||
nt|gsper:  Even less now.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ferlema: 2@S en el 3/3 interesante|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|minimeck: 17 imps to ned juniors|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|athene: reminiscent of the famous hand france vs usa in olympiad 1980s where hamman had to pick which ace was standing up|pg||
pc|hA|nt|exerdar: amazing 200  versus 7@d |pg||
nt|exerdar: hi|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|galois85: bad return... now just -1|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|athene: if you are worried that the contract might actually make, you don't lead the singleton|pg||
nt|athene: because the danger is it's a huge double fit hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed. never easy to lead from those kinds of hands :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|minimeck: here with the club cooperating, will make by guessing the heart, now that is not a problem :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|minimeck: slam time EW|pg||
mb|3H!|an|!s|mb|d|nt|minimeck: a simple hand for RKC here, should diagnose the q of spades missing and stop in 6, opposite a super accept could try for more :p|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|athene: i think they will finesse the trumps|pg||
nt|minimeck: some tools available here for drijver it seems|pg||
nt|athene: north must have lots of hearts to double with only QJ6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A slam missing Qxxx is reasonable|pg||
nt|athene: so that means you play south for the @SQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|athene: on Vacant Places|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|an|3|nt|athene: 4@D some super-accept for spades; leaves room for a 4@H re-transfer|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, certainly will play that direction, in this case, will have no chance to go wrong |pg||
mb|p|mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|Walddk2: I am not a big fan of those doubles. It sometimes also keeps partner away from his natural lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and here it gives the slam with almost certainty|pg||
nt|athene: 5@H says "have you got the @SQ, or are you confident you can guess it?" 5@S "no, and no" :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: indeed, very very rare that you're going to find pard on kx in @h for a killer lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: aggression in lead-directing doubles is another of those "style" things that partnerships should discuss but most don't|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|athene: there is a range|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|mc|13|nt|athene: you can say "we double aggressively, to help partner if he has a close choice on lead"|pg||
nt|athene: or "we only double when we really want that lead"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italian top pairs hardly ever double. "Doubles help the opponents more than us", they say. That's a valid point|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: HI|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW should get too high in @H here.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||
nt|athene: just lose the sixth club most of the time|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|athene: it helps if you can make unusual notrump bids later in the auction with confidence partner will know you are showing diamonds of course :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: nine tricks available in 3nt here with both kings onside :) |pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk devreleri yaklaþýk 20 geride bitirdik ama toparlanmak için daha 32 bord var|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: will S just super accept spades or bid 4 ?|pg||
nt|minimeck: some difficulties here will be sorted out quickly|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|gsper:  3@H presumably something like 6-9 with both M.|pg||

mb|4C|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all|pg||
nt|minimeck: we should see some fine bridge today from these two!, |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt extremely unlikely to be the best contract when you have such a shapely two-suiter|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: 3nt is for balanced hands and one-suiters|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, agreed, very suprising, especially if 3h was a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: good bidding NOT to be in 3NT:(|pg||

nt|gsper:  I did not expect to be that much right.|pg||
nt|guillemin: bad lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: quite a lucky make with @c 3-3 and @sK onside|pg||

mb|p|nt|galois85: it seems -1 by guessing the @dj |pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps the operator could inform us of the alerts|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might not realise they have any diamond fit at all - he might just think 2nt was showing a competitive 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES IT WAS|pg||
nt|athene: i would just rebid 3@D with the east hand, and if i get too high, so be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: west explained it could be weak with clubs or some good hands|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: ahora @D al K , J @D finesse y gana|pg||
nt|henryb:  now he will make 5|pg||

nt|athene: the main thing is just to know how you play|pg||
nt|athene: in other words if partner doubles and you have an appealing lead of your own, do you override him? you can feel more comfortable about doing that if you are agreed your doubles are ...|pg||
nt|athene: aggressive|pg||
nt|minimeck: i'm sure you remember that hand roland where both tables made a lead directing double and then the final contract was doubled|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That should cancel the first double|pg||
mb|1S|nt|minimeck: :) the expert treatment apparently was that the second double canceled the first, i'm not that expert :)|pg||
nt|athene: interesting problem for east now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: 2nt to show the 5-5, and then try to catch up later with the strength?|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea, usually best to show both suits|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe he thinks that at these colours 2nt shows a hand that good right from the start|pg||
nt|minimeck: not friendly for either side here|pg||
nt|athene: if north had bid 2@S weak jump shift, east might have gone 4@C leaping michaels|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: 18 was flat; no double of hearts but declarer guessed trumps regardless|pg||
nt|athene: leaping michaels can be useful in lots of situations where opps have got to 2 of a major|pg||
nt|minimeck: 4@h on a trump lead? |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: many would bid 4@H with east but that should show extra shape|pg||
nt|athene: he has already shown 5-5 so he now wants to stress his HCP strength|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Opatija fotos http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem i guess with 3nt is that west might think it shows something like 5 weak hearts and 6 solid clubs and some side cards|pg||
nt|minimeck: drijver keeping his options open here. would imagine wackwitz will correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south contemplating the axe?|pg||
mb|d|nt|minimeck: it appears so, indeed he does, pretty agressive, |pg||
nt|minimeck: at favorable north can be responding on nothing|pg||
nt|athene: you should usually be very cautious doubling freely-bid contracts (as opposed to when you push opps into something)|pg||
nt|athene: but here, EW didn't have that much room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east with a good hand over 3@H might have had to just take a view|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so they might well be too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: this will be an interesting contract to play|pg||
nt|minimeck: but as said earlier, looks like it needs a trump lead to set it|pg||
nt|athene: you try to crossruff minors don't you?|pg||
nt|athene: wow, everyone's gib works a lot faster than mine|pg||
pc|d9|nt|minimeck: i try to avoid using gib whenever possible, :) here i did not use it|pg||
nt|athene: several specs saying trump lead needed double dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: normally singleton trump not a good lead but this hand might be an exception|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|d4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|h6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: north has slow club cards; declarer very likely to be wanting to crossruff|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|minimeck: a tough lead problem for north, he can't be sure what easts minor is, will think he is leading through dummy's diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt surely was hearts and clubs?|pg||
nt|minimeck: sorry|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes you are correct of course|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|minimeck: EW have landed in 3nt at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: one argument against leading a singleton trump is that a trump lead is usually only effective if the defence can play several rounds|pg||
nt|athene: and of course if you only have one, you can't lead another one|pg||
nt|athene: but here that didn't really apply|pg||
nt|athene: because north knows his partner has the entries|pg||
nt|athene: so it might be south leading trumps lots that is the killer|pg||
nt|athene: of course these things always easier from up here :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be able to handle just the 2 heart losers and a diamond from here, can't really go wrong|pg||
nt|minimeck: are we still live operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: yes :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: operator never sleep here :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: they are thinking a lot|pg||
nt|minimeck: thanks :) fabio, Wackwitz considering all the possibilities, he should know the position, south cannot have 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: as shown|pg||
nt|minimeck: north will either overruff and allow ew to score 4 more trump, or set up the 9 of @c if he plays trump again|pg||

nt|moonbeam42:  EW managed to pitch away their @d stopper.  This will be a sizable pick up for Japan|pg||
nt|gsper:  Or all other leads are worse; not uncommon:)|pg||
nt|athene: there was no reason on that hand to suspect that declarer was going to throw diamond losers away fast on a side suit|pg||
nt|athene: and no reason to put north with a big diamond...|pg||
nt|athene: so diamond lead is dubious i think|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously had a good hand so there was lots of time for him to get in and play diamonds|pg||

nt|minimeck: on a power distribution hand like that,  would hate not to be able to show it in some shape or form |pg||
nt|gsper:  Do they play forcing 1NT?|pg||

pc|sA|nt|galois85: Dbl  at first round shows 4@s+ 1@s is a sputnik dbl without spades ( of mancinelli I mean)|pg||
nt|pelu: was 2@S forcing? - or an underbid?|pg||
nt|ferlema: debería perder una baza por palo|pg||
nt|henryb:  means partner can pass with balanced 11-13, but can bid 3 card minor with constructive hand, Roland|pg||
nt|gsper:  Sounds much like Culbertson and Goren played it.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, no, not Goren, who played 1N as 6-9|pg||
nt|gsper:  OK, 3-card minor rebid is not Culbertson either.|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: I don't buy that Henry. So you pass with KQxxx  Axx  xxx  Kxx  where you can be cold for 4@H|pg||
pc|h9|nt|exerdar: but look like they lose  a game  here|pg||
nt|gsper:  4@H obviously does not make. Perversely, I think 3NT would hava had a chance.|pg||
nt|athene: north had a cunning plan:- give his partner some heart ruffs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk5: take a card away from a minor|pg||
nt|henryb:  down to 20%, and that only with misdefense: needs @hA onside doubleton and that N doesn't give a ruff with the @hA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Look, Roland, I don't make the rules, I only tell it like it is. You may not like the treatment, but that does not give you license to say it does not or should not exist|pg||

nt|henryb:  Me, I play a 1N response is non-forcing but wide range|pg||
nt|gsper:  How many down would 4@D have been?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: west's double was helpful to opponents|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west had far too many clubs for a lead in that suit to be productive|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: Andrea, can u tell us about the players - I exp that the 2 italian teams here are 2.. 3. or 4. best?|pg||
nt|galois85: well of course the singleton  in the first suite of his partner seems a bad distribution, but after knowing that the king of hearts maybe is well placed and the 4cards fit of my ...|pg||
nt|galois85: partner I surely bid 4... |pg||
pc|hT|nt|animeshraj: hello everyone|pg||

nt|minimeck: good morning murat & welcome!|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: 3@H fine and what if you belong in 6@C?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 6@c on lets see if they get there|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 7@d bid on board one very well done and +15 imps|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt opener possible with west|pg||
nt|athene: of course you have an easy rebid with 4-5 black suits but even so|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrdct: 2@s for NS and maybe 3@d for EW here|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  With the same defense, it looks like Japan will pick up 3 imps|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont like the quality of th @Hs|pg||
nt|henryb:  tough|pg||
nt|athene: it's getting more common to simplify things with 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H some cunning bid, maybe "spades or minors"|pg||
nt|athene: this is something i think we will see more of in the future - tricky defences to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: 2@d natural or weak fit |pg||
nt|exerdar: for running skores |pg||
nt|exerdar: very important advantage  in 10 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: spad or minors|pg||
nt|athene: the main advantage simply comes from opponents' unfamiliarity|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. what does double mean; what does the "cue" mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: anyway east calls td because wasn't clear explained on front page of cc|pg||
nt|murat: thank you Matt :)|pg||
nt|atalok: diger masa 4 h konturlu oynuyormuþ|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: to be fair the hands did fit extremely well|pg||
nt|athene: it was very hard to diagnose that|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, bos' 2@d call seems to have disuaded him enough |pg||
nt|exerdar: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: dbl shows hearts|pg||
nt|athene: hearts are the one suit north can't hold; i don't know if south's pass suggests playing there anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: south didn't alerted|pg||
nt|minimeck: possible partial swing to turkey, multi by west on  3|pg||
nt|murat: as you are just informed by Matt, NS is a well experienced junior pair|pg||
nt|atabey: diðer masa 4@h kontrlu oynanýyo dedi seyirciler|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: but lack of entries to south's hand make it hard to make 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S in family with Guiseppe Failla, who played for the Blue team?|pg||
nt|minimeck: with qxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  clubs, as Edgar Kaplan said, were relegated to the trash heap in the 40's already. We don't bid no steenkin clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Right, dump Stayman|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: dbls getting lighter and lighter every year ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: north neither|pg||
nt|minimeck: might get too high, however|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gsper:  If 2@D is now 4th suit, E has a real problem.|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: 1@c = 16+ any shape, x by lean is exactly 6-7|pg||
nt|gsper:  But the Italians have sort of revived club slams.|pg||
nt|henryb:  clubs as natural, that is. See Gazzilli, Stayman, Drury|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, EW will pretend it started 1@C 1@H 1@S uncontested|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt is fair enough|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mrdct: EW trying for 3NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: lien*|pg||
nt|athene: north and south both downgraded their red queen under the bid suit i suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: I think the son|pg||
nt|athene: but this downgrading is overdone i think|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you are talking: Gazzilli!|pg||
nt|kemperg: in my system 1@C is 3+, 1D also3+, but more @D than @C|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Dbl lets him get out to @d|pg||
nt|minimeck: wow, big bid by Rodrigo here, a good agressive game vul :) will need to guess the diamond, is 2@s here intermediate ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ferlema: la voz de 2@C va a ser utilizada para invitar sobre el sin triunfo|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: yes, he his|pg||

nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: no hay forma de perder |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that lacks vision 2@h is a jump good hand and must have 5+@c - in that context S has a very good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: u see I know almost more than u :):):)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2nd x here just t/o|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be a quiet 110 here|pg||
nt|kemperg: we dont miss many minr contracts that way|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, South may bid a @d slam, but N will correct|pg||
nt|athene: north might now find it hard to bid 2@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: played by west on a @s lead might be OK|pg||
nt|galois85: =)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: giuseppe is now responsible for youth  in italy|pg||
nt|pelu: hard job|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt interesting on small heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: five rounds of diamonds give east a few worries|pg||
nt|athene: you might throw him in with a heart to lead a club|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, and that is where the open room has arrived, we shall see how it goes|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4@H looks like cold, but Uluer's need play carefuly , if he quess to AJ doubletone @d can make plus trick|pg||
nt|athene: west showed spades, and maybe south hasn't got any|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but i think the defence should prevail |pg||
nt|ferlema: si, estan todas las cartas bien puestas|pg||
nt|ybob: aún no acertando el @D|pg||

nt|murat: after the lead it's intresting now |pg||
nt|murat: normally defence gets 3@h and a trump|pg||
nt|minimeck: although crusizio had a lead problem, spade feels like it is a passive lead, pretty risky in reality, |pg||
nt|murat: with the lead Uçar has a chance to avoid the trump lose|pg||
nt|minimeck: still not 100%, east could certainly have 109|pg||

nt|MolvaM: tebrikler ve baþarýlar dileriz|pg||
pc|cA|nt|halila: another heart game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s loses a @d and a @c and possibly a @h depending on how you play that suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: a shoulder shrugging pass from dwyer, at these colors he expects a normalish opener from p, but still nothing to bid|pg||

pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: i thought turkey was ahead before we crashed|pg||
nt|galois85: I think just good fit in spades invitational to slam. maybe dbl after 2@d shows hearts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Anybody knows NS methods against 1NT?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mrdct: but stripping @c and and easy endplay with guarantee 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: same 5@h in CR - and 5@s by N|pg||
nt|athene: three chances even - declarer has to knock out a lot of cards|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|minimeck: as he has done|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: so the plan will be to draw trumps, ruff a @c and then play @DAKx to endplay either opponent|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct: can actually claim on this line after drawing 1 round of trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is always good fun|pg||

pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: teams were entered in the reverse way|pg||
nt|minimeck: still time to discard the heart losers by picking up clubs :)|pg||
nt|murat: east had a problem with the lead. heart lead is not an option. so only diamond lead does not hurt|pg||

nt|kemperg: in a @C contract, see discussion before:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|rensph: S is in 3@HX on this board in the other room.... might get bloody|pg||
mb|1S|nt|halila: ý think it is wrongly written|pg||
nt|athene: now opener has room to bid 4@H to show a good hand for spades i guess|pg||
nt|athene: he has mostly "hard" cards, so he might do that|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C 3NT|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@s açýþ veya araya giriþ makul|pg||
nt|yusufb: 1@s?|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: despite having only two spades|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to imagine a slam - but 4@H now might do the trick|pg||
nt|athene: east has a really huge hand, all the aces and a fifth heart|pg||
nt|gsper:  6@H is good here, but may go down in practice.|pg||
nt|atabey: 1@s ?|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS likely here|pg||
nt|athene: quite control-rish|pg||
nt|athene: rich|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKQ doubleton, which was the flaw when he opened, is suddenly worth a lot|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt looks a bit much, though|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: boring 4@S unless e/w find the 5 of a minor sac, 5@c being better (in 5@d @C ruff available)|pg||
nt|atabey: haha|pg||
nt|exerdar: gençler 3.den pas geçmiyor prensip olarak|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: INT TRANSFER TO CLUBS|pg||
nt|yusufb: 1nt transfer |pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: i don't see how you can go down in 6@H?|pg||
nt|athene: if double is penalty-oriented i really don't like it that much|pg||
nt|athene: but of course 4@H is a bit unilateral and might be very wrong|pg||
nt|gsper:  You are right, if the worst comes to the worst there is a squeeze on N.|pg||
nt|athene: can't you just ruff two clubs in the west hand?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Uruguay on the board after turkey let 3@s through on 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: apart from anything, the limited hand isn't normally the one to take control|pg||
nt|athene: not in well-controlled auctions anyway :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Bos will have to activate his sonar and find the diamond jack :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|atabey: pas geçmesin bu elle zaten de 1@s baya fantastik|pg||
mb|3S|nt|halila: it can be down with a careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamonds 5-1 means the limit of hand is 1nt|pg||
nt|henryb:  Thanks, Matt|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  How could E not bid slam now?  He's gotta take at least a push now|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@s normal tek kotu taraf zon ters|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: interesting that NS put balanced 20-counts into their 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: what to bid in S - 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: and is 2Nt naturel or for minor?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see that he can know his partner has good values|pg||
nt|atalok: anca güney 1 ara 4 nt key kart sorarsa 5 h cevabýna mecburen þleme gelinir .|pg||
nt|atabey: burdan sonra ancak anlaþamayýp 6ya gelirler|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  E-W here could save the day by reaching and making 6@c|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4sp normal contract here|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, but decl may feel that that risks a defensive ruff.|pg||
nt|athene: why shouldn't west have the same shape without, say, the @HK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Is it necessary to jump to 4@H?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Academic now anyway.|pg||
nt|atabey: zon oynanamamalarý imkansýz|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: south may solve that problem for him at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: difficult - i guess if you want to be passive, a trump lead is preferable|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea tough lead problem for lien, trump club, diamond?|pg||
nt|minimeck: trump seems the safest, not going to pick off pard with q@s :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you operator, yes, :) k@h not possible|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: diamond might well find partner's honour for them; i like a trump here, although you don't usually lead a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: @HK into a 2nt opener....hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but 3|pg||
nt|athene: as a rule, it's right to lead aggressively against 6 of a suit, but this auction might be an exception|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt on here, but probably hard to bid|pg||
nt|atabey: ay ay ay|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  4@h looks doomed, though - No Roland, its not.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I think with all controls and 5 trumps, you shoudl at least have 5 level safety|pg||
nt|minimeck: turkey is a very talent rich country for players at all levels of competition, can you tell us anything about the EW pair at the other table murat?|pg||
nt|murat: yes sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: the @h7 is a big card here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt better than 3@C - West can get 2@d ruffs|pg||
nt|galois85: yes... 2nt I think is natural|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this would slowly end up in 4@S. ..  |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - where did East get that 3@H from?|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason you would lead a heart is to set up a trick fast before declarer throws heart losers on a side suit|pg||
nt|exerdar: pik çýkmassa kötü|pg||
nt|atabey: kontr çok haksýz deðil. iki as kýsa pikle|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3@s dbl pik çýkma idi , karýþtýrýyorlar hep|pg||

pc|c5|nt|minimeck: lools like 11 tricks likely here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|minimeck: indeed, definetely merit to leading the heart|pg||
nt|atabey: 650. allahtan beyazda|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: that is unlikely to be the issue here|pg||
nt|gsper:  And NS in 3@H at other table? Sounds like the Menagerie.|pg||

nt|gsper:  A low trump lead might beat 7@D;)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: 3@H showing 4 spades or 6+?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H both majors i imagine|pg||
nt|murat: that's suprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|halila: no problem  on 3nt|pg||
nt|ugis: 4s a good sacrifice here against 4h|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, no, because you lose to QJ doubleton in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2 club transfer for hearts|pg||
nt|kemperg: swithces must used by the younger Dutch ( and an older one like me:))|pg||
nt|henryb:  you gain against stiff Q or J in the same hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 6@H now practical bridge, or even 6@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can forget about science|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: double shows 4+ hearts cards|pg||

nt|athene: if he bids 3nt now he shows just choice of games?|pg||
nt|ybob: se gana 4@H E-W|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be 4c 2s and 2d for the def |pg||
nt|minimeck: which suit to get to partner, however, is the question|pg||
nt|murat: 7@h|pg||
nt|minimeck: that's certainly the safe play, looking at dummy seems right|pg||
mb|p|nt|animeshraj: wow thats some pass...|pg||

mb|3H|nt|halila: a flat bord|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting methods but the normal contract non-theless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: exactly four spades|pg||
nt|athene: there is some merit to this sort of thing, the idea being to conceal from the defenders whether declarer has four hearts|pg||
nt|athene: since that isn't of any interest to east|pg||
nt|kemperg: will play @D to the Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: IF i was forced to bid I would X - but a clæear pass for me|pg||
nt|athene: some would achieve a similar result using 2nt as puppet e.g. 2nt 3@C [no 5major] now 3@H showing four spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ugis: normally 1s=5+ so with an 11 card fit EW should be rather comfortable in 4s|pg||

nt|moonbeam42:  2N = natural and forcing?|pg||

nt|exerdar:  slam try possible from south|pg||
nt|gsper:  And if not green againt red?|pg||
nt|yusufb: pastan geliyo diye cue edebilir|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mrdct: mirrored @d layout here is bad for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: can only make 2@h|pg||
nt|galois85: maybe 4 spades and a club I would think about bidding a dbl (maybe I would not...but was possible) but in this situation easy pass|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally it would show precisely 4, but especially when the 1@D can be short, you want 1@S as a general t/o without spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5@d now by lien|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W gana 4@H por 2da vez consecutiva|pg||
nt|ugis: I thought W will surprise N with 3 club bid...but he chose dbl|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6-10, |pg||
nt|athene: hands with both minors are awkward to show after an opposing weak-two|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3pikde karo çýkýþýyla  1 batýyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: red we need 55|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: *3 clubs I meant|pg||
nt|atabey: al iþte|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: mostly you just have to bid 3@D but that can easily lead to a club fit being lost|pg||
nt|minimeck: and back to a very tight match here|pg||
nt|murat: yes. getting excited|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: need to cash 3@d immedaitely|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: on this lead a @d loser goes on the @SAk|pg||
nt|ugis: 3c from N slowed down S|pg||
nt|ugis: not such an easy contract due to communication problems and bad breaks|pg||
nt|atabey: 4@s anlaþýlýr gibi deðil bu arada. ortak pastan geliyo. 5332 12 puan|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: 4-1-5-3 and 10+ ok for a TO D|pg||
nt|athene: looks like par|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H making exactly, this is one down|pg||
nt|ybob: en realidad hay pocas perdedoras pero no son seguras 10 bazas en 4@H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|halila: now 4h played by right side|pg||
nt|animeshraj: west hand doesnot warrant a cue IMO.|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo uses a 3@C overcall specifically to show both minors and that might be a good idea i think|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  Germ, are the youngsters afraid of having their bidding boxes taken away when they get over 30, so they have to get all their lifetime bids in before then? :_|pg||
nt|kemperg: suppose so :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, they just don't have any pass cards in them|pg||
nt|gsper:  When they are 30, bidding boxes will be old hat.|pg||
nt|kemperg: we had an older player missing 7NT in his box|pg||
pc|h4|nt|halila: as you see|pg||
pc|h9|nt|moonbeam42:  W hand has already said he's not interested in game, 3@s may have demanded a cue|pg||
nt|animeshraj: well if it demands... then forced 2|pg||
nt|kemperg: told him thats good for him.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ah, pass cards are issued at age 30 in Holland. Well I'm glad my Senior team will have access to them in Veldhovn|pg||
nt|minimeck: a pretty friendly hand here, trumps split, q of clubs onside|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|halila: other wise it is difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not sure it really matters|pg||
nt|pelu: they have all controls - and 6@H just need @Hs 3-2 , u can ruff a @S and disc a @C on @d|pg||
nt|galois85: on a heart guess 6@h or 6!nt thanks to the jxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|minimeck: shouldn't be too hard to defend, but no gaurantees :x|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: not sure how i'd play this - communications are really tied up - maybe double @c finese best|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yusufb: evet bencede|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pelu: if u only look at NS-card then 6@H a perfect slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 5 diamonds shows 4 aces.....|pg||
nt|pelu: but 7 - just bad bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, they are supposed to bring their own|pg||
nt|kemperg: You dont believe what happend in the matcH:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Did you not get that letter from the WBF?|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to gamble at the 5-level and gets lucky - luckyish,anyway|pg||
nt|gsper:  I can see problems with that, but Garozzo tends to know what he is doing.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|exerdar: board 6 same contract  ,2Imp for Nederlands|pg||
nt|Walddk5: NL ran out of pass cards; they are all with the youngsters|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They use them as ID for the night clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Let me 'pass'|pg||
nt|kemperg: N not happy with his bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzmw: fruscoloni sayd|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Andrea - is 5@D 0-3 or 1-4?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|galois85: well but failla supposed his partner to have also the @hk|pg||
nt|gsper:  It was quite aggressive with both opps bidding.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|galois85: 1-4|pg||
nt|atalok: aklýnda 5 d konturlu var onu çýkarmaya çalýþtý.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|rensph: well neither opponent actually promised any real values|pg||

nt|yusufb: iyimsersen 3@h de trial yap anlarým ama 4@s cokk fazla|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|animeshraj: but if its optional... then he should just bid 4H. its an effective 8hcp opener.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Obviously E didn't take him for much since he passed 4@h|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|kdr_fm: relieved to see that @ck|pg||
nt|minimeck: duck of the spade will not cost much here for Koclar :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||

nt|yusufb: 5elinde tabii buragýn kabahatide cok 4 puanla ters zonda actý|pg||

nt|athene: people who do well in the round robin can pick their QF opps?|pg||
nt|minimeck: want to prove them wrong :), Ned Rum, was the last team left from the 5-8 grouping, |pg||
nt|minimeck: yes|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|minimeck: in order 1st 2nd 3rd (4th left with whoever is unpicked)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: 2@H allows north to make a support double|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: but 2@S will work just fine anyway|pg||
nt|minimeck: with his shape simply raises on 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H splinter just in case north has the right hand - three or four small hearts say|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|athene: south doesn't really care about revealing his singelton heart to the defenders as he doesn't expect 4@S to be threatened|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|minimeck: has some guesswork here, will likely take the double finese in spades, can pick up clubs and pitch a diamond here if he leads a heart up|pg||
nt|athene: i would have led the @HA i think|pg||
nt|athene: club is way too likely to be giving declarer his club suit|pg||
nt|athene: even if the @HA lead gives declarer a pitch on the @HK, one pitch in a minor suit might well not help him all that much|pg||
nt|minimeck: he knows partner is basically dead broke, ace of hearts seems the low risk option|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: you have the @HQ too which is good because, firstly, you are not setting up a LOT of hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm, some danger maybe now|pg||
nt|athene: and secondly it means declarer never had some guess with e.g. @HKJxx in dummy that he could get wrong|pg||
nt|minimeck: if west kills the spade and exits heart heart|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: yup, then it's time to hunt the @DQ|pg||
nt|minimeck: west has shown up with KJ of spades and A of hearts if he plays that, will play east likely to have k of clubs so not 100% to finese east|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room west did lead @HA :) but diamond shift was not killing|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a fan of ace and trump here|pg||
nt|athene: how about winning the first club in hand and leading a heart?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: maybe he wanted to keep his @CQJ for a ruffing finesse but in that case playing ace and a trump is not a good idea|pg||
nt|minimeck: declarer thought for a while as he had a bunch of options|pg||
nt|minimeck: he's running out of them|pg||

nt|animeshraj: E too had a Quacky 16 ... 3@S bit agg too on 3H s/off|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if S could have played low would have had a real problem.  A good line - added the chance of @HQx|pg||

nt|animeshraj: yeah... 17:)|pg||
nt|athene: some pass cunningly with the east cards, hoping to be on lead vs 3nt in a while|pg||
nt|athene: but if south shows hearts you might regret being so cunning|pg||
nt|atalok: yaaa yusuf hocam bu yaþta yapacaklarki ilerde yapmasýnlar.bu yaþta yapma yaþlýyken yapma ne zaman ögrenecez?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|athene: north probably worth 2@H now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Pass in 3rd at favourable would be a psyche|pg||
nt|athene: also, if you actually have 3nt on, beating 1nt by a lot of 50s isn't much compensation|pg||
mb|d!|nt|athene: assuming that's a sound raise|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, they play xfers|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i doubt south will get over-excited|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3@C puppet or baron or stayman anyone know ?|pg||
nt|minimeck: spec properly points out they have a specialized system here for this, 2nt not 18-19 as standard, some sort of unbalanced forcing hand|pg||
nt|murat: i believe this 2NT has 3 meanings|pg||
nt|atalok: sürlerdim|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrdct: EW will go for the vul game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: how many times i have to say made|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3c should buy the pot|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if puppet south now knows the opps have 10 hearts between them (3NT normally denies a 4CM)|pg||
nt|athene: however, this way they miss 3nt|pg||
nt|minimeck: we shall see where it leads, 6@c pretty much ice cold baring 5-1 hearts and the singleton having a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: but no joy with @DAJ10 and @HK offside i think|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C alerted i suppose because he had good/bad 2NT available|pg||
nt|athene: they didn't ditch that even after the board 2 disaster :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 club invitationa|pg||
nt|minimeck: votes for 2@s in third seat? worked effectively in the open|pg||
nt|minimeck: pushed them to 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3nt only denies majors|pg||
nt|gsper:  He probably would have missed 3NT if he had passed too.|pg||

nt|animeshraj: u want to balance here! but the V may stop you|pg||

pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: south is not really good enough to cue bid, but maybe ok in their style|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be able to get the @s loser away on a @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not enough|pg||
nt|mrdct: this hand is a good illustration of why 4333s are worth -1hcp|pg||

nt|yusufb: cekebilir naturel atagý koz ama|pg||
pc|s2|nt|minimeck: according to rodwell, 1nt on those hands is by faaar a % winner, but don't ask me to explain the science :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|minimeck: you'd have to look in his secret files to which i don't have access|pg||
nt|athene: the trend at the top level is to open 1nt more and more on the "middling strength" 5422 and even 5431 hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the end, a flat board to finish us out|pg||
nt|athene: because it simplifies things|pg||
nt|minimeck: specifically also with stiff k|pg||
nt|athene: lots of ways you run into trouble opening, for example, 4-5-2-2 15 count with 1@H|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Thanks operator|pg||
nt|animeshraj: gd sac agst a making 3@C.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i bet 2@C would get the most votes in a bridge world poll|pg||
nt|minimeck: can't blame north for doubling for the spade lead, but doubling freely bid games for the lead like this, is not without risk as we see here|pg||
nt|minimeck: the theory being you're almost sure they aren't gonna make overtricks, if they win 4 imps by making exactly 9, so be it, but the spade lead could produce a 12 imp win|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|minimeck: although north also suggests length here, he will be on lead against a spade contract :)|pg||
