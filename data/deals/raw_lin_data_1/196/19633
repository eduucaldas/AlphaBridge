mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt extremely unlikely to be the best contract when you have such a shapely two-suiter|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: 3nt is for balanced hands and one-suiters|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, agreed, very suprising, especially if 3h was a cue|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|galois85: it seems -1 by guessing the @dj |pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps the operator could inform us of the alerts|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might not realise they have any diamond fit at all - he might just think 2nt was showing a competitive 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES IT WAS|pg||
nt|athene: i would just rebid 3@D with the east hand, and if i get too high, so be it|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: borderline decision for west over 2nt|pg||

nt|ybob: otro 3NT sin problema |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|halila: ý think it is wrongly written|pg||
nt|athene: now opener has room to bid 4@H to show a good hand for spades i guess|pg||
nt|athene: he has mostly "hard" cards, so he might do that|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: despite having only two spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS likely here|pg||
nt|athene: quite control-rish|pg||
nt|athene: rich|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKQ doubleton, which was the flaw when he opened, is suddenly worth a lot|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt looks a bit much, though|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: apart from anything, the limited hand isn't normally the one to take control|pg||
nt|athene: not in well-controlled auctions anyway :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Bos will have to activate his sonar and find the diamond jack :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|halila: it can be down with a careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamonds 5-1 means the limit of hand is 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: interesting that NS put balanced 20-counts into their 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: what to bid in S - 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: and is 2Nt naturel or for minor?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: south may solve that problem for him at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: difficult - i guess if you want to be passive, a trump lead is preferable|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea tough lead problem for lien, trump club, diamond?|pg||
nt|minimeck: trump seems the safest, not going to pick off pard with q@s :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you operator, yes, :) k@h not possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: diamond might well find partner's honour for them; i like a trump here, although you don't usually lead a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: @HK into a 2nt opener....hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but 3|pg||
nt|athene: as a rule, it's right to lead aggressively against 6 of a suit, but this auction might be an exception|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: the @h7 is a big card here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt better than 3@C - West can get 2@d ruffs|pg||
nt|galois85: yes... 2nt I think is natural|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this would slowly end up in 4@S. ..  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - where did East get that 3@H from?|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason you would lead a heart is to set up a trick fast before declarer throws heart losers on a side suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: indeed, definetely merit to leading the heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that is unlikely to be the issue here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: @D8: signal for @s|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrdct: as is the @h6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|halila: is tkere any way to confuse the defence|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: Pionto just dropped at trick|pg||
nt|athene: but of course it's easy to construct layouts where a heart is the only lead to beat|pg||
pc|h2|nt|minimeck: 26 imp swing coming|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s4|nt|athene: declarer can ruff the long heart good but he still has to get to hand to cash it|pg||
nt|minimeck: alot of options now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|animeshraj: really|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: @C9 looks the least useful card from the easy hand|pg||

pc|d2|pc|sJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: diamond back right now|pg||
nt|minimeck: 20 seconds and there it is|pg||
nt|athene: but it's too late|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: declarer now has to decide whether to finesse or play to bring the heart down but whatever he chooses will work|pg||
nt|minimeck: seems he's just got to go with the odds here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mrdct: ned young a chance to get a donut in this match|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: he hoped that south would win the @DA and leave him with some options|pg||

nt|minimeck: even the top experts disagree on alot of methodology, so as a good lesson for everyone, just know what you and your partner play :)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzmw: 10+ hcp , 3 cards support|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  2N = natural and forcing?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: double alerted because it's 4 or 5 spades?|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  ahh, thanks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mrdct: mirrored @d layout here is bad for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: can only make 2@h|pg||
nt|galois85: maybe 4 spades and a club I would think about bidding a dbl (maybe I would not...but was possible) but in this situation easy pass|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally it would show precisely 4, but especially when the 1@D can be short, you want 1@S as a general t/o without spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5@d now by lien|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W gana 4@H por 2da vez consecutiva|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|halila: other wise it is difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not sure it really matters|pg||
nt|pelu: they have all controls - and 6@H just need @Hs 3-2 , u can ruff a @S and disc a @C on @d|pg||

nt|athene: double of 1@D = 4+ hearts i assume|pg||

nt|moonbeam42:  Or, perhaps just 60 minutes ;)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|minimeck: according to rodwell, 1nt on those hands is by faaar a % winner, but don't ask me to explain the science :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|minimeck: you'd have to look in his secret files to which i don't have access|pg||
nt|athene: the trend at the top level is to open 1nt more and more on the "middling strength" 5422 and even 5431 hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the end, a flat board to finish us out|pg||
nt|athene: because it simplifies things|pg||
nt|minimeck: specifically also with stiff k|pg||
nt|athene: lots of ways you run into trouble opening, for example, 4-5-2-2 15 count with 1@H|pg||
