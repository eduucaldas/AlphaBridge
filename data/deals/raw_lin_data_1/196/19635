nt|ybob: nice spanish Murat :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||
nt|athene: just lose the sixth club most of the time|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you need to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the tables are not linked|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrdct: moysian 6@d here|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a big fan of that sort of thing though|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: it helps if you can make unusual notrump bids later in the auction with confidence partner will know you are showing diamonds of course :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: 3nt extremely unlikely to be the best contract when you have such a shapely two-suiter|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt is for balanced hands and one-suiters|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, agreed, very suprising, especially if 3h was a cue|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|athene: was 2NT just general good/bad?|pg||

nt|ybob: es necesario tomar y continuar para derrotar|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|galois85: it seems -1 by guessing the @dj |pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps the operator could inform us of the alerts|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might not realise they have any diamond fit at all - he might just think 2nt was showing a competitive 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES IT WAS|pg||
nt|athene: i would just rebid 3@D with the east hand, and if i get too high, so be it|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: to be fair the hands did fit extremely well|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: borderline decision for west over 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: play 4@S or make a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|ybob: otro 3NT sin problema |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|halila: ý think it is wrongly written|pg||
nt|athene: now opener has room to bid 4@H to show a good hand for spades i guess|pg||
nt|athene: he has mostly "hard" cards, so he might do that|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: despite having only two spades|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS likely here|pg||
nt|athene: quite control-rish|pg||
nt|athene: rich|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKQ doubleton, which was the flaw when he opened, is suddenly worth a lot|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt looks a bit much, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: apart from anything, the limited hand isn't normally the one to take control|pg||
nt|athene: not in well-controlled auctions anyway :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Bos will have to activate his sonar and find the diamond jack :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|halila: it can be down with a careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamonds 5-1 means the limit of hand is 1nt|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: interesting that NS put balanced 20-counts into their 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: what to bid in S - 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: and is 2Nt naturel or for minor?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: south may solve that problem for him at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: difficult - i guess if you want to be passive, a trump lead is preferable|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea tough lead problem for lien, trump club, diamond?|pg||
nt|minimeck: trump seems the safest, not going to pick off pard with q@s :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you operator, yes, :) k@h not possible|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: diamond might well find partner's honour for them; i like a trump here, although you don't usually lead a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: @HK into a 2nt opener....hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but 3|pg||
nt|athene: as a rule, it's right to lead aggressively against 6 of a suit, but this auction might be an exception|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt on here, but probably hard to bid|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|mrdct: the @h7 is a big card here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt better than 3@C - West can get 2@d ruffs|pg||
nt|galois85: yes... 2nt I think is natural|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this would slowly end up in 4@S. ..  |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - where did East get that 3@H from?|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason you would lead a heart is to set up a trick fast before declarer throws heart losers on a side suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|minimeck: indeed, definetely merit to leading the heart|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: that is unlikely to be the issue here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: @D8: signal for @s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: as is the @h6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|halila: is tkere any way to confuse the defence|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|nt|halila: there|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: i doubt it|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|pelu: Pionto just dropped at trick|pg||
nt|athene: but of course it's easy to construct layouts where a heart is the only lead to beat|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|minimeck: 26 imp swing coming|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ugis: however, if 1s = 11-15, w might bid on over 1nt. And then they would reach 3nt |pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: declarer can ruff the long heart good but he still has to get to hand to cash it|pg||
nt|minimeck: alot of options now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|animeshraj: really|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: @C9 looks the least useful card from the easy hand|pg||
nt|athene: easT hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: if this were the open event, we'd now see a 5-10 minute tank|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|exerdar: if be declared 3nt  @sQ on and @HKwins  ,could be a swing for Ned|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: diamond back right now|pg||
nt|minimeck: 20 seconds and there it is|pg||
nt|athene: but it's too late|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: declarer now has to decide whether to finesse or play to bring the heart down but whatever he chooses will work|pg||
nt|minimeck: seems he's just got to go with the odds here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|mrdct: ned young a chance to get a donut in this match|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: he hoped that south would win the @DA and leave him with some options|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  That was going to be a huge pitch :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: he would have a harder problem if the @DQ held|pg||

nt|play4fun55:  I think it is right to use 1 nt as semi forcing (especialy after 3rd hand opening) and then West was too heavy for his pass|pg||

nt|gmarco24: 4@h can get in some troubles if played from N's hand on a @s lead|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|gmarco24: yeah|pg||
nt|gmarco24: that too  :)|pg||

nt|gulyas: N probably has @DAK, and one @H honor, most likely the A|pg||
nt|gulyas: and also to the @CJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|animeshraj: wow thats some pass...|pg||
nt|ugis: and I would bid 4s as E|pg||
pc|d4|nt|halila: a flat bord|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting methods but the normal contract non-theless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: exactly four spades|pg||
nt|athene: there is some merit to this sort of thing, the idea being to conceal from the defenders whether declarer has four hearts|pg||
nt|athene: since that isn't of any interest to east|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: IF i was forced to bid I would X - but a clæear pass for me|pg||
nt|athene: some would achieve a similar result using 2nt as puppet e.g. 2nt 3@C [no 5major] now 3@H showing four spades|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ugis: normally 1s=5+ so with an 11 card fit EW should be rather comfortable in 4s|pg||

pc|sA|nt|halila: as you see|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|moonbeam42:  W hand has already said he's not interested in game, 3@s may have demanded a cue|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|halila: other wise it is difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not sure it really matters|pg||
nt|pelu: they have all controls - and 6@H just need @Hs 3-2 , u can ruff a @S and disc a @C on @d|pg||
nt|galois85: on a heart guess 6@h or 6!nt thanks to the jxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|minimeck: shouldn't be too hard to defend, but no gaurantees :x|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c2|pc|s5|nt|pelu: if u only look at NS-card then 6@H a perfect slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 5 diamonds shows 4 aces.....|pg||
nt|pelu: but 7 - just bad bidding|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|exerdar: board 6 same contract  ,2Imp for Nederlands|pg||

pc|dA|pc|h6|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c4|nt|animeshraj: but if its optional... then he should just bid 4H. its an effective 8hcp opener.|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: west showed his cards|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2 more to go in this segment, one more match today followed by 5 more matches tommorow in the qualifying phase|pg||
nt|animeshraj: E too had a Quacky 16 ... 3@S bit agg too on 3H s/off|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: and from E I for sure dont like the lead of @h2 - a 100% @S-lead|pg||
nt|ybob: 9 bazas para E-W en @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzmw: yes, he did it|pg||
nt|animeshraj: turks found the winning @c lead.... next door 13imps to them|pg||
nt|animeshraj: yeah... 17:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: north probably worth 2@H now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: assuming that's a sound raise|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, they play xfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i doubt south will get over-excited|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mrdct: EW will go for the vul game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: how many times i have to say made|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3c should buy the pot|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mrdct: but no joy with @DAJ10 and @HK offside i think|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C alerted i suppose because he had good/bad 2NT available|pg||
nt|athene: they didn't ditch that even after the board 2 disaster :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 club invitationa|pg||
nt|minimeck: votes for 2@s in third seat? worked effectively in the open|pg||
nt|minimeck: pushed them to 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S looks ok for me|pg||
nt|animeshraj: u want to balance here! but the V may stop you|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: south is not really good enough to cue bid, but maybe ok in their style|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be able to get the @s loser away on a @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not enough|pg||
nt|mrdct: this hand is a good illustration of why 4333s are worth -1hcp|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree seems the normal bid, |pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: 3nt has no chances|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|athene: diamond ruff coming|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to attack dummy's long suit, though|pg||
nt|athene: if it's not right, it's very wrong|pg||
nt|athene: because you gave away all the tempi in the world|pg||
nt|ybob: k@C A@C y triunfo ?|pg||
nt|ugis: while 4h would have been much more realistic|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: tell me: why lead @D4 from J 10 9??|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|animeshraj: he did venture,, brave bid !...... but not recomendeD LOL :) at 5332 and that suit that V.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|minimeck: now south's turn to provide the assist to partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok, they are running out of time|pg||
nt|minimeck: last chance :/|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is going to throw a diamond on the @HA if you don't get a move on|pg||
nt|athene: south knows his partner has some big card in a minor|pg||
nt|athene: but is it @CK or @DA?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: Board 20 will be the last for this set. there will be a lunch break now. next match starts 14:30 CET|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|exerdar: hmm  a lead problem, e-w playing  to 3@s dbl =anti lead but still doesn't |pg||
nt|ugis: in 4h, after club lead, declarer must be very carefull and lead a spade in the second trick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: if the former, he would be more likely to lead a diamond when in earlier|pg||
nt|minimeck: seems south has to conclude it is his only option, wd|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|galois85: no idea... I'm surprised|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ugis: if he leads a trump, e will take and continue clubs, take the second trump, lead spade to W and get a club ruff for -1|pg||

nt|galois85: I again agree with peter... 10 with ad in @s 2Nt is a better choice|pg||
nt|athene: double of 1@D = 4+ hearts i assume|pg||
nt|athene: and double of 2@D is support (3 hearts)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ybob: @C bloqueado, sin chance de ganar|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzmw: 50 minutes|pg||
nt|animeshraj: down 1 gd bridge:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|galois85: to play 3@d it seems...|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Or, perhaps just 60 minutes ;)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|minimeck: according to rodwell, 1nt on those hands is by faaar a % winner, but don't ask me to explain the science :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|minimeck: you'd have to look in his secret files to which i don't have access|pg||
nt|athene: the trend at the top level is to open 1nt more and more on the "middling strength" 5422 and even 5431 hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the end, a flat board to finish us out|pg||
nt|athene: because it simplifies things|pg||
nt|minimeck: specifically also with stiff k|pg||
nt|athene: lots of ways you run into trouble opening, for example, 4-5-2-2 15 count with 1@H|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Thanks operator|pg||
