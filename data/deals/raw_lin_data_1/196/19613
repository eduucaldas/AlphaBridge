nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|doks: Hi all, wellcome back to Jurmala, Teams tournament finals Latvia-Finland|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|doks: NS from Latvia playing strong club|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|runnerup: balance or no balance ---no need|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 3@S if they guess everything|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bagman: The defense has trick in each suit and possibly another in spades|pg||
nt|runnerup: no chance here atleast after this lead|pg||
nt|psyck: will make 2 in practice|pg||
nt|doks: team Latvia win semifinall vs Lithuania/Nederlands team with 12 IMP margin, Team Finland wins very convincingly|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: it was a very aggresive try esp for an NV game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|runnerup: ofcause after @d lead there could have been some littel hope|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|bagman: Veksa starting to set up the side suit; a sound priciple with a two suiter and so-so trump suit|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|runnerup: but very stange to ruff partners winner|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bagman: Patana Granström play 3rd/5th leads; by leading the 9 and following with the 10, E showed one more high card -> Patana should not have ruffed (on the other hand, E could have ...|pg||
nt|bagman: played the @CQ)|pg||

nt|psyck: the preemption seems to have worked other table with some overbidding|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|zebutin: for me 4@H seem little stretched|pg||
nt|psyck: it indeed was|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@S is 8-11|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|zebutin: and 4+ cards unbalanced (or 5+ balanced)|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: so Koistinen has maximum for their bidding|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|psyck: will play 3@h undoubled here|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: this most likely goes 3 or so down, so small pickup for Finland|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: balanced 7points (essentially 6 with Jxx in @D) isn't usually something you want to bid 4with against partners t/o double, even though partner does have short @D...|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wiki: loosing 2 @S @H and @C  or two|pg||
pc|dK|nt|zebutin: at the other table N bid only 2@D at first, and when partner raised to 3@D found more from pre-emptive hand and bid 4@D...|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have opened 3@d too|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks quite hard decision to defende 1 @d .instead of play some @s or nt -contract|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s no hope here|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: @h9 should have alerted dec to the trump position|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|wiki: @H ruff possible|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|psyck: don't particularly like the @h9 play but N had a tough guess on what to play. Declarer should have probably started @c after winning @hK|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C suit has some chances for defence too... if S ducks couple times with A, might be enough to make Jansons finese @C 10|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|ianmcc: pls who is where - the flags are wrong?|pg||

nt|zebutin: so AUNI takes the early lead with small pickup|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: @c lead needed here ( from KJ( to beat 4 @s maybe |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1@C is 15-17nt or 12-16 unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1N|nt|psyck: both tables chose 1N to 2@c overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: Hi Markkhu|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: usually not 6th club in 1nt, but tells strength quite closely, and shape not too much off...|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|wiki: EW is bidding very differently in open and closed as close open all 8 or more|pg||
nt|zebutin: not even singelton or two|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both ok |pg||
pc|d7|nt|zebutin: Koistinen knows that 16 is max for Nyberg... but must have something good for jump to 3@H in zone|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi Andre'|pg||
pc|dA|nt|zebutin: so well bid on both rooms, might be imp difference for either way, if declarer just takes 6@C+@H+@D+@S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|zebutin: or if defender tosses 1 diamond away, declarer fineses and takes 6@C, @S, @H , 3@D|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this 12 board semifinal will play one of the Finnish teams in the 12 board Finals to follow after this.|pg||
nt|zebutin: or declarer can double finese in @D, but I honestly don't see that happening...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he lead kindly but still should fail|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|c6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|zebutin: after opponents have bid @D as their suit, Nyberg might have void in that, so @D A isnt pulling all the weight it could be...so disciplined pass|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @S return still 3 tricks coming for defence, which would be 7 imps for finland|pg||

mb|1H|nt|bagman: :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: but perhaps he heart me say 8 insteadt of 7|pg||
mb|3C|nt|doks: 1@C 2+ as I remember correctly|pg||
nt|bagman: EW open 1@C even with 3-3-5-2 if outside their NT range|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|doks: no flat 4333 boards here, only swing boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: 1@H transfer showing 4+ spades|pg||
nt|runnerup: now easyer for ew to come to @s than after some jump in @d ,but north was too strong|pg||
nt|bagman: S wants to pass|pg||
mb|6H|nt|runnerup: and overbid by ns again 3. in a row|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: Is S allowed to pass now?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|runnerup: like they bid -some breaks needed|pg||

nt|bagman: he took some time to work that out|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|psyck: happy to get an entry, but either side suits needs to be played twice towards to set up extra trick|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|bagman: Even with both clubs and hearts very friendly, declarer cannot make this|pg||
nt|bagman: clubs can be set up with one lead from dummy|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||

nt|vugraphzhm: East started smiling and said that N wanted them to play 1NT.... N said no with a smile..... 3NT :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: atleast Koistinen is honest...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|zebutin: now most likely takes 1 round of spades and tries @H ruff...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|runnerup: 3nt looks natural cont..|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|psyck: ofc, a useful system as pd knows unbalanced hand on opening|pg||

nt|bagman: Declarer likely to lose a club and one diamond|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bagman: Veksa might offer his hand to E and ask him to pick one|pg||
nt|bagman: Hard to see any logical reason to lead a specific suit :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|doks: even 4-1 trumps will not create big problem in 5@D with actual layout|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|s2|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|penseur9: a strong @H contract here for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: E/W got this one cheap, might even make, or @D H lead making comfortably...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt seems like normal spot to be in, might have some difficulties with entries for @C, but when @D 10 drops has always sure entry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might need a good guess  in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: 6 @C is on and  needs 1/1 clubs  which is odds or @h finesse  also you can try to get cover on @DQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: Juzz has a very good feel at the table.... i think he will make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not - perhaps a discard on @d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bebechira: 2 aces and a trump|pg||
nt|bebechira: in theory lol|pg||
pc|s9|nt|runnerup: previos hand number 2 both rooms made 4 @s -which should have been beaten -no guess in @h helps if south takes his ace and playes a small @c to his partner to play @s |pg||
nt|penseur9: the lead will decide how many extra tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this helps. Now the discard a real possibility|pg||

nt|bagman: 3NT can be beaten with a club lead (or even spade to the A and a club switch)|pg||
nt|doks: 10 or 11 to Latvia, we have new leaders 2 boards to go|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|doks: maybe only 2 down, 2@S, 2@D, @H and @C|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -2 like counted first -so even|pg||
nt|bagman: They have to defend well  to get those 2 diamonds without setting up the @DK for a club pitch|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bagman: W can get easily endplayed if E plays a low diamond|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|runnerup: ok -10 -Latvia wins :(|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bagman: Now declarer can set up the clubs without letting E in|pg||

nt|runnerup: @d was never even mensioned|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: EW are playing precision NS are playing natural|pg||
nt|psyck: Auni missed game on board 12, which will narrow gap|pg||
mb|2H!|an|majors|nt|penseur9: they weren't very "precised" in previous hand :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h no good here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: next match starts in 50 minutes. if our commentators are available, pls let me know. thx|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|wiki: Paganus already won the Cup of Finland this week so they are hot seniors|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like 4 @h but ..|pg||
nt|penseur9: easy to get in trouble here|pg||
nt|petka: I am informed that in norway the 2NT response system i outlined is not very popular, so 3S is still an unknown|pg||
mb|4N|nt|runnerup: north considering pass/3nt / 4 @h|pg||
mb|d|nt|penseur9: standings just updated at http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/rig11/invitational/rig11invr.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: so score difference will be in single digit...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now that's interesting|pg||
mb|5D|nt|zebutin: 2@H seem to be maximum for E/W|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 5@d probably 2 down with no entry to south to take a @d finesse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wiki: I think Linde can take his 9 so congrats to Paganus again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: open room did well to stop in 3@h|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: west may get a @d trick promoted|pg||
pc|dT|nt|zebutin: this doesn't seem to be enough gain still...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, unfortunately not|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry 3@H... though 3nt is interesting|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: Looks like there are 10 winners in @hs, 3 5 1 1. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Actually 11 with the long @h in e.|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|zebutin: didn't see that one coming, but seems that has 4@H+4@D + couple @S tricks....opponents can take 2@C + 2 aces when ever...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|mrdct: if he doesn't draw trumps east gets a @c ruff|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|blum1956: Yes, LAtvia is in 2@s on board 10 which surely makes (@sA lead). Congratulations Latvia!|pg||
nt|psyck: no scope to recover here, so it will be Latvia-Finland final|pg||
nt|blum1956: So Kauko Koistinen - Clas Nyberg (winners of the invitational pairs) and Ugis Jansons (runner-up) secured more medals (this time in teams)|pg||
nt|mrdct: south may have done better to play @c5 to mask east's count|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good|pg||
nt|mrdct: but justin howard has read it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wiki: it takes a momen finding clubs 3  0 but  he can do it|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|zebutin: so looks to be making, which would be good score for Latvians|pg||
