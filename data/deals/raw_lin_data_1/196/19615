nt|athene: but was difficult there|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 6nt -1 on board 12 which i think is deserved given  the cler misfit on the auction|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: @s showing @D ?|pg||
nt|athene: transfer responses to 1@C are so common these days, any regular pair should know what a double means - whether it's showing the suit bid or takeout of the suit(s) shown|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S denying a major i guess|pg||
nt|athene: south doesn't really care if the double is spades or t/o of clubs or t/o of diamonds, does he? he can lead the @S10 whatever|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: after the double of 1@S i think EW should use the extra space to try to rightside the final contract|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I play tx responses over 1@c with reg pd and we'e agreed double shows other 2 suits so here @S + @H|pg||

nt|athene: can't east just pass to say "i have a 1nt rebid but i think it might be bettter if the lead ran up to your spades"?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: yup agree - 1NT with no @S stopper is not a good move|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs use similar ideas when more traditional transfers get doubled - for example 1nt - 4@D [hearts] X now pass says "i have @Dxxx, maybe you want to play 4@H?"|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|kdr_fm: very disciplined pass by N.  Imo the vast majority of N's will open 3@C rightly or wrongly and by passing you are likely not creating the same pressure your teammates will be under|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: 8 tricks on top with the @d finesse but the @H suit offers better chances than a 3/3 @s split but as we can see not today - probably -1|pg||

nt|athene: west thinking about 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: but you need partner to have a lot for a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: just a stopper in both majors is not enough|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 2@H its just too good and I think wayy to good for 3@h 4@h is an overbid but 3rd in hand NV|pg||
nt|athene: because then you still might not have nine fast tricks|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if partner had the lovely @SA @HA for example|pg||
nt|athene: that's still just eight tricks on a major-suit lead|pg||
nt|athene: @DKQ is no good for this sort of 3nt - too slow|pg||
nt|athene: west might also be wondering whether major-suit bids by him now SHOW stoppers or ASK for stoppers|pg||
mb|p!|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|kdr_fm: you really need 2 aces from a passed hand for 3NT to work or @SA and a good @H stop ... possible but unlikley|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|athene: north might discover his second suit now!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: was the pass really alerted ?  Hardly a F pass situation ?|pg||
nt|athene: well, 2@H forced to 3@C, so it's reasonable for west's pass below that level to be forcing|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: i think most would play that 3@C by west over the double was his weakest action|pg||
