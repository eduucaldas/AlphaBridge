nt|psyck: the preemption seems to have worked other table with some overbidding|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|zebutin: for me 4@H seem little stretched|pg||
nt|psyck: it indeed was|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@S is 8-11|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|zebutin: and 4+ cards unbalanced (or 5+ balanced)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|zebutin: so Koistinen has maximum for their bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|2H|nt|psyck: will play 3@h undoubled here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|zebutin: this most likely goes 3 or so down, so small pickup for Finland|pg||
mb|5H|nt|zebutin: balanced 7points (essentially 6 with Jxx in @D) isn't usually something you want to bid 4with against partners t/o double, even though partner does have short @D...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: loosing 2 @S @H and @C  or two|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: at the other table N bid only 2@D at first, and when partner raised to 3@D found more from pre-emptive hand and bid 4@D...|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have opened 3@d too|pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||

nt|zebutin: not even singelton or two|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both ok |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Koistinen knows that 16 is max for Nyberg... but must have something good for jump to 3@H in zone|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|runnerup: hi Andre'|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: so well bid on both rooms, might be imp difference for either way, if declarer just takes 6@C+@H+@D+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: or if defender tosses 1 diamond away, declarer fineses and takes 6@C, @S, @H , 3@D|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this 12 board semifinal will play one of the Finnish teams in the 12 board Finals to follow after this.|pg||

nt|ianmcc: cards lie well for 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|zebutin: E/W got this one cheap, might even make, or @D H lead making comfortably...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt seems like normal spot to be in, might have some difficulties with entries for @C, but when @D 10 drops has always sure entry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might need a good guess  in clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|wiki: 6 @C is on and  needs 1/1 clubs  which is odds or @h finesse  also you can try to get cover on @DQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: Juzz has a very good feel at the table.... i think he will make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not - perhaps a discard on @d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bebechira: 2 aces and a trump|pg||
nt|bebechira: in theory lol|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup: previos hand number 2 both rooms made 4 @s -which should have been beaten -no guess in @h helps if south takes his ace and playes a small @c to his partner to play @s |pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|henryb:  You make 6@h by ruffing a @c in dummy, drawing trumps to pitch dummy's diamond loser, and running spades: 5@s, 5@d and 2@d tricks|pg||

nt|ianmcc: that should deter them|pg||
nt|petka: a splinter diamonds is nice, but S would rather see a splinter spades :) Still, all those aces and the bonus J and JT are tempting|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very thin game E/W maybe 3NT better|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: right Markku|pg||
nt|zebutin: with 1@S you get to tell 5-5 quite easily|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: 3@s is ?|pg||

nt|zebutin: i think nyberg told 8+ with @C suit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|zebutin: with 2@D that is|pg||
nt|petka: scandinavian style that shows extras with diamond splinter. Hard to stop below 5 if this is such a bid|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|zebutin: yes, you are better positioned after 4@H if opponents bid on|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|wiki: Paganus already won the Cup of Finland this week so they are hot seniors|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like 4 @h but ..|pg||
nt|penseur9: easy to get in trouble here|pg||
nt|petka: I am informed that in norway the 2NT response system i outlined is not very popular, so 3S is still an unknown|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: north considering pass/3nt / 4 @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: standings just updated at http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/rig11/invitational/rig11invr.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: so score difference will be in single digit...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now that's interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 2@H seem to be maximum for E/W|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d probably 2 down with no entry to south to take a @d finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wiki: I think Linde can take his 9 so congrats to Paganus again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: open room did well to stop in 3@h|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: west may get a @d trick promoted|pg||
pc|c8|nt|zebutin: this doesn't seem to be enough gain still...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, unfortunately not|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry 3@H... though 3nt is interesting|pg||
pc|c3|nt|santyclz: Looks like there are 10 winners in @hs, 3 5 1 1. |pg||

nt|play4fun55:  should just scramble home|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: if he doesn't draw trumps east gets a @c ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|blum1956: Yes, LAtvia is in 2@s on board 10 which surely makes (@sA lead). Congratulations Latvia!|pg||
nt|psyck: no scope to recover here, so it will be Latvia-Finland final|pg||
nt|blum1956: So Kauko Koistinen - Clas Nyberg (winners of the invitational pairs) and Ugis Jansons (runner-up) secured more medals (this time in teams)|pg||
nt|mrdct: south may have done better to play @c5 to mask east's count|pg||

nt|mrdct: but justin howard has read it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wiki: it takes a momen finding clubs 3  0 but  he can do it|pg||
