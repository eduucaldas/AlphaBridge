nt|psridhar: one of the precautions declarers shd take b4 running long suit in dummy is to plan discards from hand|pg||

pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Panja|pg||
nt|panja: GM Roland, NK, all|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi panja|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|!D|mb|d|nt|panja: tricky hand..even 3N will make for NS...|pg||
nt|nkgupt: lil agressive to use some inv seq after 12/14|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: if N revaluates and upgrades after this dbl...who knows they might even bid it|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3nt has no chance on @H lead i think|pg||
nt|panja: @h will be dead if @D finesse is taken first|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 3@d normal contract |pg||
nt|nkgupt: the had game ...in 2@hX|pg||
nt|panja: funny enough...3Nt better than 3@D...|pg||
nt|panja: as 3@D is jeopardised by @H ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nkgupt: normal on the hand sud be 2@s/2@d :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: why not 1N making 2 or 3 for a normal result?|pg||
nt|panja: seems 2@C was not a Game Force....just to find out 3 card @S support...not a bad idea ..|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2@c was alerted as trf to @d|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|psridhar: kiran only had 2@d in mind|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|psridhar: like a normal person who has not seen deal records |pg||
nt|nkgupt: 2@c transfered to 2@d ...after whatever S bid was all inv hands|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|panja: right...Nt could be bad if N does not hold those two @C honours....those seeing all hands can|pg||
nt|panja: as the systems go...the 1Nt rebid could even be on 3 small Clubs...so good idea not to opt to play in Nt...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|hJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats why i open 1@c not 1@d-never understood that formula of 1@d with 4-4 in minors|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nkgupt: wudda been farbetter 2@s / double on 2@h|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s8|pc|dJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: that was the final decision|pg||
nt|panja: with @SQxx @HQxx@DAKQx@Cxxx, for example, the opening would still be 1Nt....|pg||

mb|2S|nt|psridhar: gr8 hand that West |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 4@H is on|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wonder if his ambitions will end in 4@H lets see|pg||
nt|panja: difficult to manage this one...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psridhar: for eg just add one card to West the @d king ..:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: and remove a tiny cl|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psridhar: it can be 7@d then |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: be that as it may Arvind content with 4@h as of now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: 4@s nv is cheap|pg||
nt|panja: W cannot double..as he has no Club tolerance...4@H might be too meek...as PS pointed out.....still, if E comes with @CKQ..and even 4@H might be too high|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kemperg: he had no other option|pg||
nt|nkgupt: just 300|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: what a poor hand E has...the Heart pips are also hopeless...they don't afford him an entry...|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: He has three of them, though. My partners have a singleton :(|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||

mb|2C!|an|STRONG|mb|p|nt|kemperg: R.V. is that Venky?|pg||
nt|panja: junior Venky...|pg||
mb|2D!|an|WAITING|nt|psridhar: W has a role Panja-steer to 4@s after locating 4-4|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|nkgupt: and will be the declarer too :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|panja: with 4333..and 4 small Spades...do you really think W will be interested in any 44 fit?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: ah..he gets to conduct...|pg||
nt|psridhar: his pd may have a doubleton-so locating 4-4 is rt|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: interchange the major aces between defenders, all Kiran needs to do is to find the @H lead to beat 3N ( tough of course)|pg||
nt|panja: equally...his partner may have xxxx or Jxxx in Spades....or a 5-card minor that will mean opp having some ruff possibilities....|pg||
nt|kemperg: will make 5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||

nt|panja: 5@S vs 4 or a minor...will be interesting competition|pg||

nt|panja: 4 of a minor...even|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|panja: will W think of six now?|pg||
nt|kemperg: good:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: big entry by RV!!:)|pg||
nt|panja: does a double at this level need more strength?  difficult to judge...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Plenty of strength, plenty of shape|pg||
nt|psridhar: U need the X to take care of adv saves...Arvind will have to give that leeway|pg||
nt|psridhar: stil tough for A to rule our slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: rule out|pg||
nt|panja: in absence of partnership discussion, this comes down to personalities....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't punish partner for doing the right thing|pg||
nt|kemperg: He knows NS are the crooks here|pg||
nt|psridhar: RV can easily hold @H king |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Sriniwas is still thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sure he can, PS, but when fixed, stay fixed|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6@s-iam told makes on a non-@c lead|pg||
nt|nkgupt: @hq may be as good w/ minors opener S|pg||
nt|kemperg: void @D clear to him|pg||
nt|panja: right...that is the key..when fixed..stay fixed....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: RV is under pressure after 5@D, so don't hang him|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: of course...now it is solely West's decision....E is out of picture after this pause....|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: i agree to the philosophy of 'stay fixed'- but have to take % decisions doing that |pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass did not cross my mind. I thought it was between 5 and 6@S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nkgupt: that was lil odd w/ 5@s's|pg||
nt|panja: absolutely..|pg||
nt|psridhar: pass was not % certainly|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|psridhar: it was either 5@s or 6@s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|psridhar: Arvind might have reasoned " Satya had a descriptive bid from his pd; he wanted to play in 5@d; pd expressed an opinion, so passing cannot be right"|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|psridhar: when he passed 5@d X Arvind pretty much did what Satya wanted him to ...rt?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2D!|an|Heart Suit|nt|psridhar: there are competitive situations where an oppo may act without adequate info which puts you to a guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: in such situations u can take into account that oppo may be guessing wrong and factor that in your decn|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|psridhar: but Bd 11 - satya's 5@D did not fall in that category|pg||
nt|nkgupt: odd hand ...cant see a game for NS  double dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: getting 4@H in N gives a chance perhaps|pg||
nt|kemperg: no black start for E|pg||

nt|nkgupt: satya made it too easy for srini|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|psridhar: how ever, we have to keep in mind that NS here -with their trf methods- managed to declare from N hand and everywhere else it will be from S and @s lead easy|pg||
