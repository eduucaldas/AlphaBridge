nt|Walddk2: The modern trend is to open the North hand 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2-2 in the majors and a 6-card minor not unusual nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's fine with that hand|pg||

nt|wboer: joris v lankveld started well by ducking the @c twice|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Takes a @d switch here to have a chance.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E would have to run @Hs from the top.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If Poulat has one more to play, diamonds are 4-3 and no worries|pg||

nt|Walddk5: 1993, sry|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|nt|wboer: So good/bad 2NT in west meaning a compatative weak 3@c bid with 6-card suit. 3@c in stead off 2NT = 14-16 hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If hearts are 5-2, he could have won the first trick and endplayed East with a heart after a few rounds of clubs|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, that would look silly if East started with six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: east putting in the @HJ at trick 1 forced him to commit himself immediately|pg||
nt|athene: much easier if east plays ace and a heart|pg||
