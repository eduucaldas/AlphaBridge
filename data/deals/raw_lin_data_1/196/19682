mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: ONE MINOR OR BOTH MAJORS|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gulyas: NED RUM took a sizeable lead after being 16 down in the first set|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: rdl points|pg||
nt|minimeck: a normal modern 1nt here, xx by wackwitz values here|pg||
nt|gulyas: this the 2nd of 3 sets|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|gulyas: again, 1@D is walsh, meaning he has no major unless 10+|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzmw: dbl to|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: take out|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome back everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: good morning also to Giulio @h, has done a great job so far!, we are in very good hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: ty|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rensph: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: ARG URU managed to pull 7 imps back in the last segment, still a very close match here |pg||
nt|minimeck: hello Rens|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: Rodrigo will need to lead diamonds to set 3nt here, should be no problem holding the ace of clubs |pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  this 3N will go down quickly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|minimeck: he will know with 100% certainty that NS have a long club suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would have liked that 1@H being played out...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|minimeck: knowing they do not have a heart fit and his partner has the long spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: normal 1nt by north here, double is purely takeout :) if he had the guts, could have got 300 in 1h |pg||
nt|gulyas: he would have deserved that for overcalling with that junk|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|minimeck: East decides to make a game try here, a foul lie here even 2@h might go down|pg||
nt|minimeck: same contract other room|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|rensph: I'd seriously consider opening 1NT as E here|pg||
nt|rensph: this is a pretty bad hand for it but usually it works out with 15-17 bal|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|gulyas: or 500 maybe|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|minimeck: i disagree there, a 100% overcall, |pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, alot of players have shifted to the philosophy of opening all 5-3-3-2 distributions in the point range 1nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction pretty normal for 15-17 or 14-16 NT openers|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s5|nt|minimeck: I believe rodwell when he says its by far the winning % bid |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|minimeck: but a flat board will be the outcome :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gulyas: I would never ever overcall with that, only gets you into trouble, either directly or indirectly (by revealing where the points/distribution is)|pg||
nt|gulyas: a pile of jacks, wk suit (come on, opps take 3! tricks in that suit against you in NT)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: in junior bridge is mandatory|pg||
nt|gulyas: I know that juniors like to bid:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: that still makes it a bad call|pg||
pc|s6|nt|minimeck: Good morning everyone :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|minimeck: Argentina have shown they do not open 1nt very, often however, 3 or 4 hands where they didn't open 1nt even with 4M and 5 M -2-2|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5 (card minor)|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be a push here to start things out|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  hi Matt|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: we used to preempt like crazy when we were juniors - we were always happy when we did not get x-ed:) its was the 'oops, they did not take their 1100 again' feeling:)|pg||

nt|wboer: Nice result in open room voor NED. 5@s is down on a @d ruff.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|MolvaM: hi all pictures from Opatija http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143 !/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||
nt|wboer: Some partnerships play Michaels. 4 minor = 5+ in the suit named and 5+@s|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|wboer: Or leaping Michaels, as bid in open room by Helmich |pg||
nt|twcho: non leaping michael?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|wboer: yes, much played in Holland|pg||
mb|4N|nt|twcho: 5@s can be set|pg||
mb|5H|nt|twcho: if singleton @d lead|pg||
mb|p!|an|0|nt|wboer: dopi ropi for S. Pass show 0/3 aces, I think|pg||
nt|twcho: but CR west didn't find it|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: singleton lead is always among the top choices for me|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|twcho: 13 imps for Ned|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|wboer: Always lead your singleton. After @h lead it is diff for E to find the ruff|pg||

nt|minimeck: a flat 3nt here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: good slam bid and made by ARG in the OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|minimeck: spectator proposes east could have doubled 3nt, almost being sure that he will have five tricks, seems he was content with a plus score here |pg||
nt|minimeck: NS can also make 4@c |pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see how the Dutch handle it here|pg||
nt|rensph: It can be difficult to stay calm and focused when you know you're behind 20-30 imps, but usually there's no reason to force any swings if you manage to bid and make your game ...|pg||
nt|rensph: contracts.|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|4H|nt|gulyas: strange x with 5c@H suit, but at least he can offer all other suits as well, not as bad as it looks|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S bids 3@S now, they will end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi 2@d and leaping michaels by N|pg||
mb|4S|nt|minimeck: Rodrigo(da rosa) personally said he was pretty exhausted by the matches thus far, but i'm sure they slept very soundly, should be fresh today, can make 4 here but not 5 with the ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: diamond ruff|pg||
mb|5H|nt|minimeck: first blood to the south americans here, some neat tools here for Ned, does anyone know what 1nt is here?|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzmw: 1 nt = 5+ clubs and 4th ajor|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: major|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: thank you, Raptor 1nt , :) interesting choice with 7-4|pg||
nt|Walddk5:  for those who want to watch more than one room:  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile|pg||
nt|minimeck: I cannot imagine Wackwitz will sit for this, but he will have a tough time catching up here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Daniel Gulyas|pg||
nt|gulyas: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|minimeck: good morning Daniel :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, not multi|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: this certainly sounds like a pen dbl, but S has no trumps to lead, and has a 7carder in @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: in any case, if rodrigo's auto-6@s on the previous set was a predictor, a good save available |pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: this will be beaten 1 or 2 tricks, but NS has game|pg||
nt|minimeck: Clearly he was not happy with this quandary, but he had no clear way forward|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3NT and 5@C both makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: hm, N did not think his black holdings are enough for slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead will set...@h lead will require E to guess to play A@d|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  and this will hand contract to NS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|minimeck: decides to take the plus, a very good start for ARG URU as NS have arrived in 3nt|pg||
nt|minimeck: might be able to get out for 100 here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|minimeck: very simmilar in many sports such as soccer, even a goal down in the second half, you don't sell out and send everyone forward until about 20 or so minutes left, if you give ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: anything more up, you're dead, :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: can score 5s, 3h, 2d and a club here|pg||
nt|minimeck: but might duck a diamond|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|gulyas: and his red holdings looked to be dubious opposite at least one short red suit|pg||

nt|twcho: I think it is a bit dangerous|pg||
nt|wboer: First imps for NED. NS can recover now by bidding 7@d|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|twcho: very good grand slam here|pg||
nt|twcho: can they reach it?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|twcho: probably 2@d promise 5+ cards|pg||
nt|twcho: just guesswork|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|wboer: In closed room S was captain when he asked for aces. N should do that. But S broke dicipline because he didn't tell partner all aces were in.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|twcho: slam bidding especially to reach grand is a very delicate process|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: would S have bid different with AKxx xx KQJx xxx ?|pg||
nt|twcho: if partner bid 6@c now, north can still reside in 6@d|pg||
nt|kemperg: kickback RKC gives more space to look for the right K|pg||
nt|twcho: but south didn't dare to pass 6@d which may be the last playable spot|pg||
nt|twcho: but since north is unlimited and supposed to handle all possible response from south|pg||
nt|kemperg: with kickback he stays under 6@D|pg||
nt|twcho: south should trust him and bid 6@s|pg||
nt|twcho: then they can reach 7@d|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|twcho: south is not sure whether his @sK is useful or not|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|twcho: maybe partner is looking for @hK|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|wboer: The 4NT by N is bold. If he bids 4@c S will cue-bid with 4@s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, the 4NT bid is a bit hurry|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c7|pc|d2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|twcho: he has enough space to continue the cue bid before committing himself to keycards|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h7|mc|13|nt|twcho: so both tables fail to reach the par|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SAK63H43DKQJ32CT5,SJT8HQ985DT86CQJ6,SQ5HAKJT7DA754CA9,S9742H62D9CK87432|sv|e|nt|minimeck: a partial hand here, NS will likely end in 2nt or 3 clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: cutting the deficit to 20|pg||
nt|minimeck: fans rooting for action, the last set usually full of fireworks, we will have to wait a bit :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: very agressive lead by Maxi, perhaps looking to find pard with Ax|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|gulyas: a partscore battle here, NS can make abt 2-3@Cs, EW is good until abt 3@S|pg||
nt|minimeck: especially with two attractive alternatives, somewhat suprising, chance for a swing|pg||
nt|andyv:  on prior hand, as spec pointed out, I meant to say muidberg convention...used in conjunction with the multi...we'll see if that is what EW play|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|minimeck: double or 1@h both options here on the east hand, with the quality of the heart suit and poor spades, chooses 1@h here|pg||
nt|rensph: looks like a matter of overtricks in 4@H here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|MolvaM: hi all pictures from Opatija http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143 !/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: but the 1@H overcall (which is normal) leaves no way to find @Ss on a safe level|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless it goes 1NT-p-2@C now|pg||
nt|gulyas: then he can dbl for t/o|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|minimeck: note wackwitz only bids 1nt, Bob is extremely well known for some light bids, and he is 3rd seat favorable :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good slam here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|gulyas: he has 7 tricks from top, maybe able to get another trick by an endplay|pg||
nt|rensph: 2NT forcing a 3@C bid from partner, after which S will show a GF 5-5|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|minimeck: will likely lead the A@d |pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 4 clubs support hearts|pg||
nt|minimeck: seeing dummy should cashout, we shall see :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@c should set up a game force and NS have plenty of room to explore for slam|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|minimeck: strip endplay also available in 3@c , and scanavino has found it, will be a push or an imp|pg||
nt|minimeck: exactly :) plenty of room to cue bid here, i predict they will get there no problem|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rensph: 4@C not necessarily showing a club cue, just setting trumps and giving partner the room to bid 4@D, which doesn't promise a cue either but a good hand for the bidding so far|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|gulyas: has to get this right for the overtrick|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: spectators ask 6 or 7, :) too late for a prediction but this seems sensible|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|minimeck: 7 is a pretty high % contract, however :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should invite 7..he knows they have all the controls and should ask N to reevaluate his hand.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|gulyas: S not in a happy position|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  either 5@s or 5N might get N to act....5@s would make it easier for N as the Q@s would now take on added value|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: ok, so 1 imp to ARG again|pg||

nt|twcho: Kickback is a useful but dangerous weapon|pg||
nt|wboer: NS in this room have a difficult time after these 3 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|wboer: Agressive take out double in closed room by S. Anyones choice?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|wboer: 2@c = Gazilli|pg||
nt|twcho: I will pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|3C|nt|twcho: of course I don't object to the double especially partner is passed hand|pg||
nt|wboer: 3@c is not the right contract. Maybe N will save them with 3@d|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wboer: If E had passed on 1NT they would have scored a plus.|pg||

nt|gulyas: perhaps @H are better here, but you still lose 5 tricks either way|pg||
nt|minimeck: and back to even for this set :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: yes, most likely they will play 2NT (or maybe 3:))|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: yuck, what an ugly 8 count|pg||
mb|1S|nt|minimeck: can make a few spades or hearts here|pg||
nt|rensph: 2@C from S now, showing majors?|pg||
nt|minimeck: a 1nt opener for my taste here on east, i predict 1@s from GdR, they have not opened many offshape 1nts|pg||
nt|minimeck: this tournament|pg||
mb|d|nt|minimeck: that is a common and very usefull treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: on a @D lead, even 2NT can be beaten|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|minimeck: no other way to bid these hands over 1nt|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gulyas: is this a 14-16NT?|pg||
nt|minimeck: :) perhaps they play 14-16?|pg||
nt|gulyas: beat ya:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the @s suit is pretty top heavy for a lot to open 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|play4fun55:  should be possible for N/S to get their h ruff for one down|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|minimeck: the majors of course good to have partnership agreements on expected length, well sorted out here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|minimeck: spades are flopping, and trumps 3-3, maybe a 5th for defense in the wash|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gulyas: they can take 3@Ds, 2@Cs and a @H|pg||
nt|minimeck: Maxi crusizio out for blood meanwhile in the open room, will collect very nicely and a big swing to uruguay argentina|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gulyas: to keep it to just making|pg||
nt|minimeck: allready two boards where the argentines have opened the "old school" 1m and 1M while bob elects 1nt, has worked out well so far for them|pg||

nt|minimeck: Crusizio and Garcia Da Rosa meanwhile are much more "meckwellian" in there approach, i think they have chosen well to play this pair|pg||
nt|minimeck: on many hands like this as well, makes it alot tougher on opps to get in on the partscore battle|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|play4fun55:  4 h is a likely contract|pg||
nt|minimeck: another action hand here, NS can make 5@d, after a likely 1nt opener will they find it|pg||
nt|minimeck: north would balance over a 2@h contract here, however, should be normal|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, W was pretty conservative on last hand...could have at least shown some values by bidding 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: X shows 5m 4M|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|minimeck: and another telephone number for Agica Nistor in the other room! now in 2@h x|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: although perhaps i spoke too soon :), yet again a non-1nt opener|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  game in @hs coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: this time a 25-point 3NT is a maker|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gulyas: W trying for game now, seeing the big fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: same spot here, should be 800 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E should bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: very strange bidding here, :) i imagine now maxi will bid 3nt shoulder shruggingly|pg||
nt|gulyas: showing his pattern to give pd the chance to look out for the red suits|pg||
nt|minimeck: might be able to establish a long club|pg||
nt|minimeck: that lead helps certainly|pg||
nt|minimeck: in practice 800 not realistic, :x defense has to give something up|pg||
pc|cK|nt|minimeck: a flat board to give everyone a chance to grab their coffee and donuts :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S wants a refund on his lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: really his only option on lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: but will make it pretty easy for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|andyv:  this board would be more interesting in a BAM event where finessing for the @S would be very tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: NEXT THE LEAD RODRIGO CLOSED THE SCREEN AND ASK SOMETH TO NORTH|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzmw: garica didn't alerted 3 spades wathever it means|pg||
nt|rensph: Other room played by W, leading a small diamond|pg||
pc|c6|nt|minimeck: getting too fancy here,|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|minimeck: might have needed to duck there for tempo|pg||
pc|hK|nt|minimeck: the important thing to note here, when you decide not to open 1nt it is impossible to show "15-17" balanced :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: really, both should have bid 3NT at some point:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: still strange for him not to bid 3nt over 2@s|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|gulyas: once again the suits are not too friendly|pg||
nt|minimeck: but south endplayed now|pg||
nt|minimeck: must find a diamond shift to get the spade through|pg||
nt|rensph: @DA @DJ now?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|rensph: Had north held any spade values he would've played his small clubs the other way around|pg||
nt|minimeck: south in the same pickle as before, he should have seen this coming and possibly shifted to a diamond earlier, |pg||
nt|minimeck: he still has to guess, however|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|gulyas: the lead blows a trick for the defense, but its only an overtrick|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  a ruffing finessin clubs  against west should see south home though|pg||
nt|gulyas: taking the ruffing finesse in @Cs works, as the 9 is dropping|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|minimeck: a white game for the NED rum and a likely 7 imps|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be 11 tricks |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|gulyas: losing a @D and a @S, making 5, and losing 6imps in the process|pg||
pc|d4|nt|play4fun55:  no other sensible line for South to follow either|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  would have been better to winn the last h in hand and take the ruffing finess directly, now South might be in trouble|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|minimeck: correct, 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|minimeck: no reason to hook the spade :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gulyas: so NED RUM on the board now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzmw: south calls td|pg||
nt|gulyas: I imagine some rapid Spanish under the screen now:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: can't imagine what for, a good board for him|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: complain for spade lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am sure if he knew they were 4-3 in @Ss, he would have led sg else|pg||
nt|minimeck: so perhaps the overtrick at issue|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, and it also counts as an IMP, 270=7|pg||
nt|minimeck: Rodrigo and maxi are pretty calm, they aren't like the famous italians :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: to garcia 3 spade was almost natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: he supported|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, I like to steal some phrases from the late mr Anderson:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: td change the score, just made|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|gulyas: of course he doesn't know that all his @Cs are high|pg||
nt|minimeck: North will be forced to give up a trump trick here|pg||
nt|minimeck: will only get two more|pg||
nt|minimeck: a fine defense compounded by poor declarer play in the open room and the likely unlikely 800 is achieved by Da rosa :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  11 tricks not that easy|pg||
nt|minimeck: kindof forced here to end play south :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: so no need to search for slam|pg||
nt|wboer: I think it was a seious / non serious 3NT. So 4@c is a mild slam try with @c cue-bid. With good SI S will bid 3NT first|pg||
pc|h4|nt|twcho: so bidding 3@s promise 2 out of 3 top honors?|pg||
nt|wboer: After mild SI N could sign off in 4@h|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|twcho: since south bypass 3@s|pg||
nt|wboer: It depends on agreements. I reversed the 3@s and 3NT bid. So 3@s is serious SI. 3NT = mild SI with @s cue|pg||
nt|twcho: what is the advantage of reversing? can you tell us more?|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, so the right score is 16-7|pg||
nt|minimeck: did west alert 3@s giulio?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: yes he did it|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  always easier to play seaing all 4 hands Daniel :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so another 12 to ARG, cutting the deficit yet again, to 12|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree:)|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  even I make an occational contract then|pg||
nt|minimeck: another swing hand here, 4s might make with some good guesswork or defensive help|pg||
nt|rensph: lots of things to do though.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|gulyas: there had to be a misunderstanding, otherwise they would have played 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: as specs point it out, all other declarers in the semis made it, so maybe it was not me only who thought he could have done better:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, in practice will likely go down, Nistor has underlead his king of diamonds, that will help in the open|pg||
nt|minimeck: As we previously discussed, playing 4 handed is never easy and they have had a grueling journey to get to this point, after 5 boards though |pg||
nt|minimeck: one would hope they didn't celebrate their victory too late yesterday !|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|minimeck: ok, maxi took 3@s as something artificial, so wackwitz entitled to the trick as a result of the false alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but it was a very light alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: not a big one|pg||
nt|gulyas: is there such a thing?:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: is a tough lead problem, however|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like small club lead is a winner :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: that would be quite impressive indeed|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gulyas: I only alerted a little, don't take it to heart:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: when they think some questions should be asked they strong alert|pg||
nt|gulyas: pass? are you sure?|pg||
nt|minimeck: not possible|pg||
nt|gulyas: back to WW, this time trying his hand at 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: Ned Juniors will not allow you to escape unscathed for naping like that|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, it is bridge, the cards don't weigh that much and they have youth on their side...only the late night partying should be a factor:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|minimeck: too much work for Rodrigo, wackwitz amazingly does not raise here|pg||
nt|minimeck: will win a swing back for NED|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south seems to have downgraded his @dQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: W hoping that his pd will return his suit so he can run it... not to be, tho|pg||
mb|3C|nt|minimeck: 2nt a 4 card heart raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: sry...|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, better now - 2nt had to be a @H raise|pg||
nt|rensph: Still, I'd be tempted to raise.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gulyas: ok, so @D lead and a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|play4fun55:  a h return would make it harder for South. Now he should be able to set up and access the clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: a very common treatment to play 2nt in these situations as such, what some people may normally play over a double|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless systemic, N has chosed an unsual way to bid this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: sry, maybe I miss an alert|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzmw: 3 club was alerted|pg||
pc|s5|nt|minimeck: raise seems normalish* but decided to take a position 4333 and as you say qd doesn't look apetizing|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|minimeck: kindof normal to misguess trumps|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Giulio|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|c2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|minimeck: should be able to make this, and I can't imagine he would be tempted to finese west for qxx in hearts.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|play4fun55:  Either South knows something I dont know, but I would have started playing on clubs?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: doesnt worry too much about the trumps at this contract|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: at 4@s though, the lead might give declarer a clue|pg||
pc|c3|nt|minimeck: alejandro dutifully underleads his club now looking at dummy :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gulyas: I may be old fashioned, but I play a cue as inv+ with support, and 2nt is natural (but I agree you don't often want to bid a natural 2nt)|pg||
nt|minimeck: but wont have any guess in that regard :)|pg||

nt|andyv:  7@h a big card|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|minimeck: yea, declarer might reason that the fact he underlead a king indicates he has a tough hand to lead from (and trump tricks)|pg||

nt|gulyas: np|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: a rdbl here would show a high honor in @S in my system, I wonder if others play this gadget too|pg||

nt|minimeck: no fear by Da Rosa :) |pg||
mb|6H|nt|gulyas: S not happy to hear that xfer|pg||
nt|minimeck: in most cases, these transfers are not "manditory" as with an NT opener, south is free to bid his hand w/o tolerance|pg||
nt|rensph: 5@C down on 3 roudns of @H?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Ned Juniors lead france by 8 imps|pg||

mb|p|nt|minimeck: might escape undoubled here, interestingly enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this can go down 800|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 1100|pg||
pc|sK|nt|minimeck: you are correct, :) was not looking closely enough, 3nt the normal spot|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to blame either N or S for not doubling this "confindently" bid slam :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S has a clear dbl...at least to warn N from bidding 6@s if nothing less|pg||
pc|sA|nt|minimeck: south would have not enjoyed 3@c at all, 3@d by maxi here an "all in" bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: is N gonna apply the axe? no|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: now that declarer knows @Hs are not favourable, he will play on @Ds|pg||
nt|minimeck: i think declarer will have trouble avoiding 5 losers here|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can take 4@Ds, 2@Hs and 2@Cs for 8|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|gulyas: maybe he can sneak the @S9 thru first:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: really, 5 to the 9 is not a very strong stop in NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: it maybe OK in 1NT, but not in 3|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|minimeck: declarer can take them all now if he wishes, after taking 6 clubs his heart and 2 spades, can either hook the diamond |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|minimeck: or just go AK and hope for the q to drop|pg||
nt|minimeck: certainly could be right, the 4@s bid by north here is entirely nebulous, however, he could be doubling a cold slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|minimeck: agreed, that is likely his best shot|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|minimeck: but he needs to protect his side|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  A@d and @c shift would produce down 4...with dbl, 1100|pg||
nt|minimeck: worth the risk :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hA|nt|gulyas: there was really no need to jump to 3nt, he could have started with 2@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: interestingly, this is at least the 3rd (if not 4th) hand in this semis where you should play 5 of a minor instead of 3nt despite stoppers in all suits|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you call Q vs 987xx a stopper, that is...|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: well east claimed and now td is at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: one or two off|pg||

nt|minimeck: hard to blame him for that, although with east being marked AKQ of @h, certainly an option to finese :p|pg||
nt|rensph: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: another 6 for NED RUM, closing the gap|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: i think west should have passed 3@c there, if he more carefully considered the context clues of the auction, his p could not raise spades, nor double 2@d, and north made a transfer ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: to hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: in anycase he did have a complete count for the 12th|pg||

nt|minimeck: a passout! :) first i've seen so far this tournament|pg||
nt|andyv:  W actions were reasonable and optomistic|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's because no flannery bidders here|pg||
nt|minimeck: so chance for a swing to ARG URU on that board perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: extremely bizare if that's how the play went|pg||
nt|gulyas: 11? wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: crusizio disarded a diamond|pg||
nt|gulyas: was he patting his own back, too?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: a big swing there|pg||
nt|gulyas: do that for us then|pg||
mb|1D|nt|minimeck: he wasn't even pressured on the discards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice @h distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I mean, pat his back:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|minimeck: halfway done and 10 imps between the teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: another 3nt here for NS|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west is lucky that he is not the dealer here|pg||
nt|minimeck: for some reason people seem to love to argue about flannery more than any other convention, not my preference but i don't have a problem with it :p|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|minimeck: on a diamond lead will be a bit interesting|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a weak 2@h opening could go for a number|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gulyas: Lebensohl in action here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|gulyas: specs say with the walsh convention you have to start with 1@H response on the S hand, but I disagree|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree Daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: walsh states you have to have GF with 44, and inv+ with 54|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the S hand qualifies for a 1@D easily|pg||
nt|gulyas: Leb-slow as opposed to Leb-fast in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: later I'll do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: EW will have to keep there composure here, after giving away two game swings|pg||
nt|gulyas: in the OR they did start with 1@C-1@D-2@D, and they were never in doubt abt the right contract|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS got lucky with the bad discard|pg||
nt|minimeck: they right sided the contract here :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: ty:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: td comes back with 3nt one off|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: good call|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2@d and 3@c here show?|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt might have had a chance here, 4@h will not succeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  too many good pairs play it (Levin-Weinstein come to mind) so it can't be ignored.|pg||
nt|andyv:  does N have a bid over 2N?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gulyas: so instead of 10 out, its 2 in for NED RUM, down by 1 only|pg||
nt|minimeck: kib points out 9 top tricks even on a diamond lead from east, don't need clubs :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2d looked for a 3-card @h support probably?|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3@s 3@c 2@d 1@h|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree, oftentimes with conventions like that, it's less often a case of one being vastly inferior or superior, rather it being a part of "filling out the system" of each pair|pg||
nt|minimeck: i might pass 2nt white, but he had some fillers|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|minimeck: decided to go for it, if i were to bid, however, i would never bid 3s|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's close...I imagine a lot of players would have bid 4@h with the S hand immediately anyway|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|gulyas: can he scramble an overtrick? either @Hs, or @S offer a chance to take one more|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, the opps have @HAK and @DA, so only of he sneaks a @H thru can he make 10|pg||
nt|gulyas: but this is no pairs tournament|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs 9, so he will play for 9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: another 3NT not making, while 5@D would have...|pg||
nt|minimeck: for those interested, NED juniors up early against france, very possible we might see an all NED finals (+ 1 US / 1 Romanian) , that would be exciting|pg||
nt|gulyas: and when S gets in with his @HAK, he will have the 4th@C to cash to keep it at 9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|minimeck: Nistor raised to all of 2@d on his 16 count with 5 card support, so they have landed in only 2 in the other room|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will not be pretty|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c3|pc|h8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|minimeck: and we will have a new leader|pg||
nt|gulyas: if N had held all the @S cards (QJ98), he would be squeezed now|pg||
nt|minimeck: at favorable the expectation is north will respond on zero basically and a major, hop giving his p some margin |pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzmy: yes|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: OK, 3S promise 55 in M|pg||

nt|wboer: 3@c = 5H-4S min, 3@d=5H+4S max, 3@h=5@h+5@S min, 3@s=5@h+5@s max. Just guessing :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: when i read or listen to something, i say you, but usually they speak very low|pg||
nt|twcho: they shouldn't speak with screen. rather shd write in paper. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: yes should, but usually speak only|pg||
nt|twcho: Actually, I recommend one using paper for explanation even without screen|pg||

nt|gulyas: so after being 0-16 down, NED RUM took the lead 21-16|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats even faster:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: if it wasn't for the @D ruff, 4@S would make|pg||
nt|minimeck: a possible swing board here, a thin 3nt is ice cold on this layout |pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind the 2N bid..right on values and the @h spots make a @h contract a little less attractive|pg||
nt|minimeck: alot of swings out there to be won for those willing to follow hamman's rule|pg||
nt|minimeck: very likely might be a push on the previous|pg||
nt|andyv:  I tell my partners to ignore that rule and make sure they have the cards that I need|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|minimeck: has been a very apparent stylistic difference between the two teams here, good for the spectators to see :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec tells me that 2N was mandatory as 4@h bid would show weak hand with a lot of distribution.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 3NT makes tho:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: could also possibly make 4@h here, :) will be interesting to see|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: once again the 4 card raise w/ 2nt|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be a flat board here in 4s|pg||
nt|rensph: in the other match this board was a push in 3NT +3|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: for those who have not heard it, Bob Hamman is known for saying "when 3nt is an attractive option, choose it"|pg||
nt|minimeck: more of a general guideline than a rule|pg||
pc|d5|nt|minimeck: what does north bid here at this point|pg||
nt|rensph: 2NT?|pg||
nt|minimeck: and AR URU are on there way to game|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2nt a possibility, nothing perfect he has a decent overcall but nothing that extra|pg||
nt|minimeck: he knows they don't have the HCP for game|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2@h here both majors?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was thinking of the other Hamman rule....don't ever play me to have a specific card or holding, I never will and you will always be disappointed.|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes... :) another good one|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: now will it go 3@S-4@S or 3NT-pass?|pg||
nt|gulyas: or maybe 3@S pass?:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: its hard to imagine a worse 11 count now|pg||
nt|gulyas: balanced, with Jxx in opp's suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: if this 3@S is not forcing, I want to pass:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|minimeck: a very sensible pass|pg||
nt|rensph: the double diamond stopper might be enough to set up partner's clubs though|pg||
nt|minimeck: and AR URU have bid 4@h !!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|minimeck: a good save available in 5@d, only 500|pg||
nt|gulyas: if it goes @D, @D ruff, would't you underlead your @CAKQ to try to get another ruff?:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5@c|pg||
nt|minimeck: we will see if they do make it|pg||
nt|minimeck: another flattish board here, this will play nicely|pg||
pc|h7|nt|minimeck: on a spade lead should be a simple matter discovering the position immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, EW do look like they play the polish weak two bids|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: so I expect an overtrick:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|minimeck: I would imagine so :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess he did not want to look too stupid by missing a vul game, so he bid one more for the road |pg||
nt|gulyas: so, is this forcing for everyone? acolers?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: my impression is that he did it so|pg||
nt|rensph: given the spade layout you'll probably end up making 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|gulyas: if 3@D can be this weak, then 3@S should be passable|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to see how he could go wrong|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|gulyas: (beat Lauria-Versace 800 with that, but who remembers that:) )|pg||
nt|minimeck: credit the southamericans perserverance, they hung with it even after a 48-0(ish) stretch in the first quarter|pg||
nt|rensph: they'll be leading by 1 imp after this board|pg||
nt|minimeck: and another action hand, a near 2 loser hand in south, but off two aces, should be able to stop after some RKC|pg||
mb|3N|nt|minimeck: :) at least one person does|pg||
nt|gulyas: yep:)|pg||

mb|d|nt|minimeck: can make 4@h here by guessing the diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|minimeck: WOW|pg||
nt|andyv:  S didn't bid 4@h|pg||
nt|minimeck: giuliio?|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: he will have to find the jack|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|gulyas: not a good fit this time, with AKQ opposite singleton|pg||
nt|gulyas: so game is out of the Q, can he get 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|gulyas: if they duck this, he can win, discard 2 @Cs on the @Hs|pg||
nt|gulyas: then he will get the @Ds right obviously, but can he guess trumps too?|pg||
nt|gulyas: its normal to play @SA-@S from hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: S may also play @DA, small @C, but thats not likely|pg||
nt|minimeck: some danger now|pg||
nt|minimeck: any one know for sure how they play 5@h here? |pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: he will need to give up some tricks in the meantime, can he manage all that? lets see|pg||
nt|minimeck: he can survive two taps|pg||
nt|gulyas: its possible, take this, cash @HAK, lead a @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: taken, @HJ cashed, first tap|pg||
nt|gulyas: play a @D to the Q and A|pg||
nt|gulyas: second tap, and cross to dummy with the @Cs to take the finesse|pg||
nt|minimeck: that would work here, can go either way in diamonds, however :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|minimeck: he might simply hook east for the jack|pg||
nt|gulyas: but the wk jump makes W favourite to hold @D length|pg||
nt|minimeck: scanavino passes with the north hand, so more imps on the line|pg||
nt|gulyas: especially once E shows up with 6-3 in the majors|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|minimeck: wow|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to blame either side here|pg||
nt|rensph: 5NT asking keycards|pg||
pc|sK|nt|minimeck: too late to ask for keys|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rensph: they'll soon find out they're one too high already|pg||
nt|minimeck: east should double 6@d here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gulyas: when he tries @Cs, he will see that he also had 2@Cs, so he is most likely 6322|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was just going to type that it isn't worth doubling with the E hand because W may well pull it and a plus score may be changed to a minus|pg||
pc|s9|nt|minimeck: but ferro will lead a minor for sure|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|cQ|nt|minimeck: and there it is, 9 or so more for Ned|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, so 5 back to the leaders|pg||
nt|minimeck: i'm sure this board will be much discussed by all parties involved, i think both players actions here reasonable|pg||
nt|andyv:  that is does|pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile south passed the hand with KQxxxx in spades in 1st chair allowing the auction to develop naturally and they have settled in 4@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: so, ARG URU started the match well, but have a 34-0 against their 16-0, so down 18 already|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be a nice swing for arg uru|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@h can make|pg||
mb|3H|nt|minimeck: a prime 19, might just blast rkc|pg||
nt|andyv:  in fact a very decent contract|pg||
nt|guillemin: hi|pg||
nt|guillemin: all|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: but bypassing keycard to cue bid or (invite) slam always has that risk|pg||
nt|minimeck: bienvenidos Guille, welcome! @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Guille|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5 more bds to go, lets see what they can make out of it|pg||
nt|minimeck: the imps have been well deserved, they will have to stop the bleeding pretty quickly|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is 2 down only, while NS can even make slam with the lucky @H lie|pg||
nt|minimeck: these auctions are some of the toughest to handle, |pg||
nt|gulyas: nice 3nt made in the OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  hope NS have some other meaning for 3@h than a weak 3 bid|pg||
nt|guillemin: hola estaba mirando desde un principio con martin |pg||
mb|5C|nt|minimeck: most people play x here as "penalty-ish" but is more of an optional double|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: bob goes "all in with 5nt pick a slam"|pg||
mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|minimeck: and garcia insta-saves, he trusts his opps|pg||
nt|minimeck: ferro lying in the weeds here|pg||
nt|minimeck: will balance for sure|pg||
nt|minimeck: appears Alejandro has gone down in 4@s, another 7 for Ned|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|gulyas: he does have a useful 13 count|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d probabably Q ask|pg||
nt|minimeck: asking for the queen here, he's knows the missing keycard is the K of hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  10@h in S hand make this a better than 75% slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: but does not know pard has the jack |pg||
nt|minimeck: i predict he will bid it anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  even so, can play for 7-2-2-2 hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he doesn't know about the K@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: all right, spec points out that @D lead beats 6@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the @H interiors falling, it should be easy sailng|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: yes, he would also be concerned it might have little to no play on a club lead, and that is what he has decided here|pg||
nt|andyv:  depending on style, I'd prefer a one @h or 4@h opener (more inclined to 4@h)|pg||
nt|minimeck: too many unknowns|pg||
pc|d2|nt|minimeck: wow, garcia has gone down in 4@h, |pg||
nt|minimeck: that will prove quite costly|pg||
nt|rensph: didn't play for the @H finesse, it seems|pg||
nt|minimeck: he didn't actually need the heart finese on his line|pg||
nt|minimeck: play here should be quick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: E went for the insurance tho with 6@S, only going 800|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|gulyas: the way @Ss are, @S lead would have made life more difficult|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he still would have gotten home with 4@H-3@C-2 aces|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he needed to guess which finesse to take for that|pg||
nt|minimeck: thought for waaaay to long and put himself in the deep freeze, made a no play play|pg||
nt|andyv:  N hoping KQx(x) of @hs is to his left|pg||
pc|h4|nt|minimeck: just had to cash the club|pg||
nt|rensph: trying to cash the @ST couldn't really win|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|gulyas: could have gone for the cash @CAK, if no Q appears than @D finesse route|pg||
pc|h6|nt|minimeck: 16 imp swing and 5 to NED|pg||
nt|minimeck: a sigh of releif for their fans|pg||
pc|h2|nt|minimeck: i am somewhat suprised by the auto save holding AQ of @h, saving on these auctions when opps have basically "guessed" to jump to slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: is a gamble|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d5|pg||

nt|wboer: The only strange thing is that he informed about the @hQ. If he was going to bid 6@h anyway he could bid it directly after 5@c|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, this will create a tempo problem|pg||
nt|twcho: if partner tanks before responding |pg||
nt|wboer: Exactly. If N bid slowly to 5@h then a director could be called |pg||
nt|twcho: and result will be roll back to 5H+1|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|twcho: so one must plan before the bid|pg||

nt|wboer: Lucky imps for NED. We all see that @dQ lead is down but is this clear?|pg||
nt|twcho: and lucky for declarer that south didn't have T, J or Q in D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, the spade lead is just a shot in the dark. if partner has only one diamond you are aiming at a very narrow target to try to beat 3N with a different lead|pg||

nt|minimeck: NS had trouble sorting out the NS hand and ended up in 5@c|pg||
nt|minimeck: so a huge swing to Ned|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, I stand corrected: neither slam makes, so this may end up expensive|pg||
nt|minimeck: someone should drop a hint to the kibs in the other match :), we could decide this on the last board|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N from W side can't be touched|pg||
mb|3D|nt|minimeck: 48 unanswered now and this will prove to be a tall order for Arg uru|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will bid 3@d|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|minimeck: as we have seen thus far, the southamericans have favored a more conservative approach|pg||
nt|minimeck: they will have to change gears to try and mount a comeback|pg||
nt|gulyas: N will try for game, and S will not accept|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the favourable @C lie, 3@H makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W should bid 3N but may opt for 5@cs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|gulyas: N goes: what on earth did we agree on after 1M-2M?:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: strange enough, ARG missed this game at the other table, with 13-13HCP|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe 3@D was intended as forcing|pg||
nt|minimeck: despite a string of plus scores, north south will likely be feeling some concern, |pg||
nt|minimeck: looks like a bit too much for 4@h to fetch here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: on a @S lead 3NT is down tho|pg||
nt|minimeck: surely wackwitz will pick hearts here|pg||
nt|minimeck: but they will not go, i suspect east will compete|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|minimeck: good bid here by Maxi, Da rosa looking for slam|pg||

mb|6C|nt|gulyas: oh, ok, short suit game tries, I remember:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: i can assure you they know their system :p|pg||
nt|gulyas: just trying to make a little joke here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: as it is, no game is making, I can see that:) but could you always tell that and stop from 2 obv opening hands, and a decent fit?|pg||
nt|rensph: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: big bid by bob here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: N probably had a different picture of partner's hand in mind|pg||
nt|minimeck: although wackwitz doesn't have the typical takeout x, he has a right to expect a bit more|pg||
nt|minimeck: spectators tell me 2h promises 4 here, south regretting his initial double decided to try and get out as low as possible|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|minimeck: we gotchya, sometimes hard to read the tone (textually) just clarifying|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gulyas: both @S honors offside and also the @CK off, 3NT is down on a @S lead, and 5@D also has 3 tricks to lose|pg||
nt|minimeck: south is quite a fine experienced player, this double to me shows that he is pressing|pg||
nt|rensph: it doesn't really promise 4, you just bid your longest major so very few occasions on which you don't have a 4crd in the suit you bid.|pg||
nt|andyv:  very difficult for E to slow down but the stiff @d and minimum @c support should have stopped him|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|guillemin: i know Rodrigo will be bidding the slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: Rodrigo forced to slam on his own hand, certainly not the worst contract in the world, but, the speculative slam here gets what it deserves in my opinion|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @hs were 4-3, W might have had a chance here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|minimeck: vul with 3/3 in the majors no shortness, no nothing really|pg||
