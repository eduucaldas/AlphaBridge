nt|gsper:  A modern style weak 2.|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: fireworks to start things off... here lankveld 6-4 in the majors blasts slam opposite bos' michaels, missing 2 cashing aces, |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H rechaza game|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: YES|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|minimeck: will likely find the shift here to set 6s, however, the other table, q@c lead allows 7@dx to roll home|pg||

nt|exerdar: hi|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|galois85: bad return... now just -1|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|athene: if you are worried that the contract might actually make, you don't lead the singleton|pg||
nt|athene: because the danger is it's a huge double fit hand|pg||

nt|ybob: nice spanish Murat :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Rens|pg||
nt|rensph: hi all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 1@c strong or something else ?|pg||
nt|exerdar: showing 2plus cards i quess|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  But it worked nicely.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Germ|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kemperg: HI|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||
nt|athene: just lose the sixth club most of the time|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you need to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the tables are not linked|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: moysian 6@d here|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a big fan of that sort of thing though|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: it helps if you can make unusual notrump bids later in the auction with confidence partner will know you are showing diamonds of course :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kdr_fm: will S just super accept spades or bid 4 ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gsper:  3@H presumably something like 6-9 with both M.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C 33, 3NT is on|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: 3nt extremely unlikely to be the best contract when you have such a shapely two-suiter|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: 3nt is for balanced hands and one-suiters|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, agreed, very suprising, especially if 3h was a cue|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kemperg: good bidding NOT to be in 3NT:(|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: was 2NT just general good/bad?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: wow 4@S by N is abit much - even with the fortunate lie in D this is unlikely to make|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ybob: un claro paso de W que será penalizado !|pg||
nt|ferlema: la defensa debe tener cuidado en no bloquear el corazon|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mrdct: 6NT right sided here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: quite a lucky make with @c 3-3 and @sK onside|pg||
nt|ybob: es necesario tomar y continuar para derrotar|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|galois85: it seems -1 by guessing the @dj |pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps the operator could inform us of the alerts|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might not realise they have any diamond fit at all - he might just think 2nt was showing a competitive 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES IT WAS|pg||
nt|athene: i would just rebid 3@D with the east hand, and if i get too high, so be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: west explained it could be weak with clubs or some good hands|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: ahora @D al K , J @D finesse y gana|pg||
nt|henryb:  now he will make 5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|minimeck: an immediate answer for the US, EW have bid to 6@d after a 3h overcall and 4d bid|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|mrdct: undo that - the @s hook and @c break are only good for 10 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: even with @ss 4-0 4@S sh make|pg||
nt|minimeck: on a power distribution hand like that,  would hate not to be able to show it in some shape or form |pg||
nt|gsper:  Do they play forcing 1NT?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 50% contract I suppose was fair enough but would have passed with N hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|mrdct: 4@h a chance here for EW|pg||

nt|ferlema: la voz de 3NT fue apresurada|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Sorry, still too early for me.  A sizable pick up for Turkey :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk5: what is semi-fp|pg||
pc|s8|nt|minimeck: cards very friendly for NS here , 3@s by north strictly competative, no game interest|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S por N|pg||
nt|Walddk5: semi-forcing?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1 or 2 more imps for japan here|pg||
nt|pelu: tell us Andrea - what would 1@s from W show?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 CARDS |pg||
nt|rensph: not quite forcing but you tend to bid on|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: tough call - lousy spade suit 4333 defensive hand vul do you want to balance ... who knows|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzmw: I MENA 2 SPADES SHOWS 3 CARDS|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: MEAN|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the open south chose to make a cue instead of single raise, got them to game|pg||
nt|ybob: 3NT p 4@S  p p p|pg||
nt|exerdar: e-w started very good  in first boards|pg||
nt|rensph: range 6-11 or so|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Can a woman be semi-pregnant? No, either she is or she is not, and either a bid is forcing or it is not|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|galois85: Dbl  at first round shows 4@s+ 1@s is a sputnik dbl without spades ( of mancinelli I mean)|pg||
nt|pelu: was 2@S forcing? - or an underbid?|pg||
nt|ferlema: debería perder una baza por palo|pg||
nt|henryb:  means partner can pass with balanced 11-13, but can bid 3 card minor with constructive hand, Roland|pg||
nt|gsper:  Sounds much like Culbertson and Goren played it.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, no, not Goren, who played 1N as 6-9|pg||
nt|gsper:  OK, 3-card minor rebid is not Culbertson either.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: japan came 3rd in the asia-pacific championships in kuala lumpur in june so have qualified for next year's world youth championships expect to be in cuba|pg||
nt|galois85: underbid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: juniors are normalt not afraid of bidding, but for sure Mancinelli is :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: THEY'RE DISCUSSINE EAST DENIES 4 CARDS SUPPORT IN SPADE|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk5: I don't buy that Henry. So you pass with KQxxx  Axx  xxx  Kxx  where you can be cold for 4@H|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|exerdar: but look like they lose  a game  here|pg||
nt|gsper:  4@H obviously does not make. Perversely, I think 3NT would hava had a chance.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk5: take a card away from a minor|pg||
nt|henryb:  down to 20%, and that only with misdefense: needs @hA onside doubleton and that N doesn't give a ruff with the @hA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Look, Roland, I don't make the rules, I only tell it like it is. You may not like the treatment, but that does not give you license to say it does not or should not exist|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ybob: apresurado jugar triunfo y tomar de A por Este|pg||

nt|henryb:  Me, I play a 1N response is non-forcing but wide range|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west's double was helpful to opponents|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west had far too many clubs for a lead in that suit to be productive|pg||
nt|kemperg: so do I|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: Andrea, can u tell us about the players - I exp that the 2 italian teams here are 2.. 3. or 4. best?|pg||
nt|galois85: well of course the singleton  in the first suite of his partner seems a bad distribution, but after knowing that the king of hearts maybe is well placed and the 4cards fit of my ...|pg||
nt|galois85: partner I surely bid 4... |pg||

nt|Walddk5: Now you are talking: Gazzilli!|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: difficult but interesting hand.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: east decides he has mainly a defensive hand, with length in both the opponents' suits|pg||
nt|athene: i would still bid 1nt over 1@S; nice to get your hand across early|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|rnmalik: agree seems a good pass.|pg||
nt|athene: sure, sometimes passing cunningly can work out well, but if opps *don't* get into trouble, you can find you never showed your hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: still, it seems to have worked out quite nicely here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should not bid 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: not so much because he is weak - sometimes it's ok to bid 1@S there without many hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he has @HJ10x and stiff diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: the stiff @D prompted 1@S.|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: dangerous hand suits breaking badly want to stay low|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|Walddk5: Double 4+ spades presumably. Many use 1@S to deny spades, often as a transfer to 1NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|galois85: 2@d multicolor... |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894  for running scores|pg||

pc|d6|nt|Walddk5: After 10 rounds, top 8 advance to the quarter-finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|gsper:  Top honour, acc to another kib.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|pelu: 5@H: woid-wood - asking for Aces outside @h|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well done S I'd say many with that very good 15 count would double or try 3@d ,,, the 1NT warned him off|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|halila: another heart game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s loses a @d and a @c and possibly a @h depending on how you play that suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: a shoulder shrugging pass from dwyer, at these colors he expects a normalish opener from p, but still nothing to bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: same contract both tables should be flat|pg||

pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: i thought turkey was ahead before we crashed|pg||
nt|galois85: I think just good fit in spades invitational to slam. maybe dbl after 2@d shows hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: but stripping @c and and easy endplay with guarantee 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: same 5@h in CR - and 5@s by N|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|mrdct: so the plan will be to draw trumps, ruff a @c and then play @DAKx to endplay either opponent|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mrdct: can actually claim on this line after drawing 1 round of trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is always good fun|pg||

nt|kemperg: in a @C contract, see discussion before:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: borderline decision for west over 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: play 4@S or make a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|ybob: otro 3NT sin problema |pg||
mb|1H|nt|rensph: S is in 3@HX on this board in the other room.... might get bloody|pg||
mb|p|nt|halila: ý think it is wrongly written|pg||
nt|athene: now opener has room to bid 4@H to show a good hand for spades i guess|pg||
nt|athene: he has mostly "hard" cards, so he might do that|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: despite having only two spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS likely here|pg||
nt|athene: quite control-rish|pg||
nt|athene: rich|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKQ doubleton, which was the flaw when he opened, is suddenly worth a lot|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt looks a bit much, though|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: boring 4@S unless e/w find the 5 of a minor sac, 5@c being better (in 5@d @C ruff available)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: apart from anything, the limited hand isn't normally the one to take control|pg||
nt|athene: not in well-controlled auctions anyway :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Bos will have to activate his sonar and find the diamond jack :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is interesting|pg||
mb|4S|nt|halila: it can be down with a careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamonds 5-1 means the limit of hand is 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: interesting that NS put balanced 20-counts into their 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: what to bid in S - 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: and is 2Nt naturel or for minor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  E-W here could save the day by reaching and making 6@c|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4sp normal contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Is it necessary to jump to 4@H?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: south may solve that problem for him at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: difficult - i guess if you want to be passive, a trump lead is preferable|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea tough lead problem for lien, trump club, diamond?|pg||
nt|minimeck: trump seems the safest, not going to pick off pard with q@s :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you operator, yes, :) k@h not possible|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: diamond might well find partner's honour for them; i like a trump here, although you don't usually lead a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: @HK into a 2nt opener....hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but 3|pg||
nt|athene: as a rule, it's right to lead aggressively against 6 of a suit, but this auction might be an exception|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt on here, but probably hard to bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  4@h looks doomed, though - No Roland, its not.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @h7 is a big card here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt better than 3@C - West can get 2@d ruffs|pg||
nt|galois85: yes... 2nt I think is natural|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this would slowly end up in 4@S. ..  |pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - where did East get that 3@H from?|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason you would lead a heart is to set up a trick fast before declarer throws heart losers on a side suit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|minimeck: indeed, definetely merit to leading the heart|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: that is unlikely to be the issue here|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Hearts confirmed|pg||
nt|gsper:  A low trump lead might beat 7@D;)|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 3@H showing 4 spades or 6+?|pg||
mb|p|nt|halila: no problem  on 3nt|pg||
nt|ugis: 4s a good sacrifice here against 4h|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, no, because you lose to QJ doubleton in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2 club transfer for hearts|pg||
nt|kemperg: swithces must used by the younger Dutch ( and an older one like me:))|pg||
nt|henryb:  you gain against stiff Q or J in the same hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 6@H now practical bridge, or even 6@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can forget about science|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: double shows 4+ hearts cards|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: i know what i will lead as south|pg||
nt|pelu: look at that over 2@D on a very bad 5 card suit - not in my book - do u like that overcall?|pg||
nt|athene: if he bids 3nt now he shows just choice of games?|pg||
nt|ybob: se gana 4@H E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|animeshraj: wow thats some pass...|pg||
nt|ugis: and I would bid 4s as E|pg||
nt|henryb:  The earth is flat, and created in 6 days in 4004 BC|pg||
mb|3H|nt|halila: a flat bord|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting methods but the normal contract non-theless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: exactly four spades|pg||
nt|athene: there is some merit to this sort of thing, the idea being to conceal from the defenders whether declarer has four hearts|pg||
nt|athene: since that isn't of any interest to east|pg||
nt|kemperg: will play @D to the Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: IF i was forced to bid I would X - but a clæear pass for me|pg||
nt|athene: some would achieve a similar result using 2nt as puppet e.g. 2nt 3@C [no 5major] now 3@H showing four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: normally 1s=5+ so with an 11 card fit EW should be rather comfortable in 4s|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: or 3@C as puppet often same sort of thing|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: or maybe east could bid a natural and forcing 2nt there but chose not to because he didn't want to imply two hearts|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: I am out guessed by E:)|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|athene: so he bids 2@S because if his partner bids 3@S he still has 3nt|pg||

mb|2C|nt|vugraphzmw: 10+ hcp , 3 cards support|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  2N = natural and forcing?|pg||
nt|kemperg: both sides play a 4-8 or 2-6 muiderberg, 5M + 4+ m|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 and 2nd hand green againt red|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: double alerted because it's 4 or 5 spades?|pg||

nt|exerdar:  slam try possible from south|pg||
nt|gsper:  And if not green againt red?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mrdct: mirrored @d layout here is bad for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: can only make 2@h|pg||
nt|galois85: maybe 4 spades and a club I would think about bidding a dbl (maybe I would not...but was possible) but in this situation easy pass|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally it would show precisely 4, but especially when the 1@D can be short, you want 1@S as a general t/o without spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5@d now by lien|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W gana 4@H por 2da vez consecutiva|pg||
nt|ugis: I thought W will surprise N with 3 club bid...but he chose dbl|pg||

mb|3N|nt|galois85: *3 clubs I meant|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: on this lead a @d loser goes on the @SAk|pg||
nt|ugis: 3c from N slowed down S|pg||
nt|ugis: not such an easy contract due to communication problems and bad breaks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: 4-1-5-3 and 10+ ok for a TO D|pg||
nt|athene: looks like par|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H making exactly, this is one down|pg||
nt|ybob: en realidad hay pocas perdedoras pero no son seguras 10 bazas en 4@H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|halila: now 4h played by right side|pg||
nt|animeshraj: west hand doesnot warrant a cue IMO.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb:  Germ, are the youngsters afraid of having their bidding boxes taken away when they get over 30, so they have to get all their lifetime bids in before then? :_|pg||
nt|kemperg: suppose so :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, they just don't have any pass cards in them|pg||
nt|gsper:  When they are 30, bidding boxes will be old hat.|pg||
nt|kemperg: we had an older player missing 7NT in his box|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|halila: as you see|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|moonbeam42:  W hand has already said he's not interested in game, 3@s may have demanded a cue|pg||
nt|animeshraj: well if it demands... then forced 2|pg||
nt|kemperg: told him thats good for him.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ah, pass cards are issued at age 30 in Holland. Well I'm glad my Senior team will have access to them in Veldhovn|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|halila: other wise it is difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not sure it really matters|pg||
nt|pelu: they have all controls - and 6@H just need @Hs 3-2 , u can ruff a @S and disc a @C on @d|pg||
nt|galois85: on a heart guess 6@h or 6!nt thanks to the jxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|minimeck: shouldn't be too hard to defend, but no gaurantees :x|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: not sure how i'd play this - communications are really tied up - maybe double @c finese best|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|pelu: if u only look at NS-card then 6@H a perfect slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 5 diamonds shows 4 aces.....|pg||
nt|pelu: but 7 - just bad bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, they are supposed to bring their own|pg||
nt|kemperg: You dont believe what happend in the matcH:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Did you not get that letter from the WBF?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|exerdar: board 6 same contract  ,2Imp for Nederlands|pg||
nt|Walddk5: NL ran out of pass cards; they are all with the youngsters|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Let me 'pass'|pg||
nt|kemperg: N not happy with his bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: fruscoloni sayd|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Andrea - is 5@D 0-3 or 1-4?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|galois85: well but failla supposed his partner to have also the @hk|pg||
nt|gsper:  It was quite aggressive with both opps bidding.|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rensph: well neither opponent actually promised any real values|pg||

pc|c8|nt|animeshraj: but if its optional... then he should just bid 4H. its an effective 8hcp opener.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: CR 6@C a good result.|pg||
nt|athene: if you find the @DQ you can eliminate the red suits and play ace and a spade to the queen i guess|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: if S could have played low would have had a real problem.  A good line - added the chance of @HQx|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double dummy a finesse or two and a good @S guess will bring in 6@c|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: and from E I for sure dont like the lead of @h2 - a 100% @S-lead|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: north probably worth 2@H now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Pass in 3rd at favourable would be a psyche|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: assuming that's a sound raise|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, they play xfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i doubt south will get over-excited|pg||

mb|4C|nt|mrdct: EW will go for the vul game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: how many times i have to say made|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3c should buy the pot|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if puppet south now knows the opps have 10 hearts between them (3NT normally denies a 4CM)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mrdct: but no joy with @DAJ10 and @HK offside i think|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C alerted i suppose because he had good/bad 2NT available|pg||
nt|athene: they didn't ditch that even after the board 2 disaster :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 club invitationa|pg||
nt|minimeck: votes for 2@s in third seat? worked effectively in the open|pg||
nt|minimeck: pushed them to 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3nt only denies majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S looks ok for me|pg||
nt|animeshraj: u want to balance here! but the V may stop you|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|fabsayc: south is not really good enough to cue bid, but maybe ok in their style|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be able to get the @s loser away on a @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not enough|pg||
nt|mrdct: this hand is a good illustration of why 4333s are worth -1hcp|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree seems the normal bid, |pg||
nt|kemperg: let them escape|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: 3nt has no chances|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|athene: diamond ruff coming|pg||

nt|athene: declarer is going to throw a diamond on the @HA if you don't get a move on|pg||

nt|exerdar: hmm  a lead problem, e-w playing  to 3@s dbl =anti lead but still doesn't |pg||
nt|ugis: in 4h, after club lead, declarer must be very carefull and lead a spade in the second trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: if the former, he would be more likely to lead a diamond when in earlier|pg||

mb|3S|nt|moonbeam42:  The next set will start about 90 min from now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: here I would just bid 3Nt in W why make the bidding more complex?|pg||
nt|galois85: I again agree with peter... 10 with ad in @s 2Nt is a better choice|pg||
nt|athene: double of 1@D = 4+ hearts i assume|pg||
nt|athene: and double of 2@D is support (3 hearts)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ybob: @C bloqueado, sin chance de ganar|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: 50 minutes|pg||
nt|animeshraj: down 1 gd bridge:)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|galois85: to play 3@d it seems...|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Or, perhaps just 60 minutes ;)|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk5: sorry, I forgot Göran, thanks to you too|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looking at the scores I am going to guess that it will take about 164 or so to reach the quarters|pg||
mb|5S|nt|minimeck: according to rodwell, 1nt on those hands is by faaar a % winner, but don't ask me to explain the science :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: you'd have to look in his secret files to which i don't have access|pg||
nt|athene: the trend at the top level is to open 1nt more and more on the "middling strength" 5422 and even 5431 hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the end, a flat board to finish us out|pg||
nt|athene: because it simplifies things|pg||
nt|minimeck: specifically also with stiff k|pg||
nt|athene: lots of ways you run into trouble opening, for example, 4-5-2-2 15 count with 1@H|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Thanks operator|pg||
nt|animeshraj: gd sac agst a making 3@C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1Nt here - In my book = 8-10, so easy 3Nt from W|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|animeshraj: low H now..|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: partner bids 1nt and you wish you opened 1nt|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ferlema: bastante audaz decir 3NT con el @HA seco |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ybob: había que descartar @C en N|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|guillemin: excelente resultado para el equipo sudamericano|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: well, best chance to make a stiff king is to open 1nt :)|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: para luego el otro @C sobre K @H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s7|nt|halila: an unlucky board |pg||
nt|mrdct: if he gets @h right chance to get opps to open up the @s suit|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry Rens:(|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rensph: :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|halila: 4-0 trumps and spade Quenn off side|pg||

nt|minimeck: thanks for tuning in everyone, next match in 45 min|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't know that the @HK is marked there|pg||
