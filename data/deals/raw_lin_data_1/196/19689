nt|hedyg: some might open the W hand as 1@H|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: can she find a 6@d bid?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW might be playing 2-way weak 2s such that multi is more like a minimum opener with 6 cards while 2M is weaker|pg||

nt|marlowepi: close to it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|hedyg: the preempt 2@d did its job|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: this slæam is better :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Weak 2 or 5/4+?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C for NS - will EW sac with two aces?|pg||
nt|ugis: now S will bid hearts :)|pg||
nt|ugis: on actual layout NS can make 6d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ricky86: of course :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showing hearts i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: and that will not delight south|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think i would want to stress the hearts with north|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: is 4@H now a cue bid or re-transfer?|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 5@s-4+ in a minor 5-10hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is practical bridge, I'm all for that|pg||
nt|athene: he has more a balanced hand with scattered strength, than a heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: but i imagine 1nt was not available (probably showed clubs)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  This will probably end in 3N, making |pg||
nt|mdgraham: always depressing to see partner pass as delaer when all you hold is three jacks |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: raising clubs might work well now|pg||
nt|athene: people rarely do that, though, in this day and age|pg||

mb|p|nt|ricky86: maybe re transfer|pg||

nt|athene: *south sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will NOT cover @D10|pg||
nt|mdgraham: chioces would seem to be 2NT or 3@c  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: east thinking about a diamond sac?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: 5@h??|pg||
nt|ricky86: 5@h?|pg||
nt|wboer: Good lead. @cK and @s switch is diff for decl|pg||
nt|athene: takes a club lead to beat 6@S i guess?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: This is the last round in the Swiss - 8 best to KO - Japan no 7 with 152 and Australia 1 + 2 + France No 8 with 145|pg||
nt|athene: stops declarer cashing one spade then finessing|pg||
nt|athene: because you don't have the entry to dummy when you need it|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Poulat has one more to play, diamonds are 4-3 and no worries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a duck caters for a 5-2 split|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: no comments please.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the 5 IMP - in B2 EW stopped in 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess he was playing for e to be 5/5 in the blacks.|pg||
nt|athene: now if it goes 1@S - 1NT from EW, south can't really double, as that is t/o of spades|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: 5@c = min, 5@D = 1/4, 5@H = 0/3, 5@s = 2+@sq + tx Wubbo|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: ty :)|pg||
nt|ugis: once again NS can reach 6 diamonds, only that this time it is down 1 after spade ruff|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wboer: but the @dQ holds the trick so east had the @dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT? looks odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will pass and Lebatteux can't really bid again|pg||
nt|athene: north can bid 2@D now |pg||
nt|hajru:  I think they play Gazilli (1M-1N-2@c) for strong balanced hands, freeing up 1M-1N-2N for special hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told Gazzilli, strong 5/5....thanks|pg||
nt|hajru:  I guess N will bid 3@c and S will specifiy|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2@D or 2NT in S being non-vul or pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wecan see that 2NT is makeable, but there is a risk that declarer goes wrong|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: Opatija fotos http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||
nt|wboer: some partnerships play 2NT as good/bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has to guess which finesse to take, and if he chooses spades, he must guess who has A and Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i think this is a bit of a sucker double from south in fact|pg||
nt|athene: north clearly has a hand too weak to raise diamonds over 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: and that is a very weak hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|athene: say, 2 points or so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you might well beat 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not a sure thing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the straightforward bid, but 2H could also be effective, with the plan of bidding 4D if partner  bids 3N at some point|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wboer: 2NT in S for the minors was not poss, because west opened 1@c|pg||
nt|athene: your spades are not exactly well-placed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would get the idea of promary diamond support across while emphasizing hearts|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|andyv:  E can create some opportunities by playing the A@s and @s|pg||
nt|kakashi84: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: and east didn't have to bid 2nt|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: I am impressed if he gets this right|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here is looks as if 4N was RKC. many top class pairs use a different call than 4N for KC in the minors, because there is insufficient space between 4N and 5 of the trump suit. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: various forms of this method ar e called "kickback" or "redwood" or other labels. it is a very good idea in principle, but it is essential to have firm agreements on which call is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: KC and WHEN that call is KC|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ugis: they did indeed bid 6d in open room, so France will almost tie the match after board 17|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  on 3rd @s, N will ruff with K@h and finesse for Q|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is a very good example of what s.j. simon talks about in his book|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy 11 tricks - should be flat|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: "why you lose at bridge"|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Wubbo de Boer, world champion 1992|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: he gives a hand almost exactly like this|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  E not aware of hand's potential|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1993, sry|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|wboer: So good/bad 2NT in west meaning a compatative weak 3@c bid with 6-card suit. 3@c in stead off 2NT = 14-16 hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If hearts are 5-2, he could have won the first trick and endplayed East with a heart after a few rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N does not know which black king S has, so it may seem that 7D is a dangerous risk. in my view it is the correct call, though, because:  a) S might have heart queen     b)  S might ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have spade king -- he is about a 60% favorite to have that king rather than the club king        c) S might have S jack in which case it is a five-or-seven hand anyway|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: However, that would look silly if East started with six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: east putting in the @HJ at trick 1 forced him to commit himself immediately|pg||
nt|athene: much easier if east plays ace and a heart|pg||

pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: "automatic" in an auction where your goal is to bid your side to the best spot is one thing. but the conditions here are quite different|pg||

nt|ugis: not familiar with their system, 4c might be natural, sets clubs as trumps...or it might be ace asking|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wboer: 3NT is high but has play if @d are 3/2|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you can guarantee to keep south off lead, your best chance of a double stop in diamonds is to rise the @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to cut down on ruffs against the likely 44 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and this one is comfortable as well|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ricky86: a good choice 3nt when you have few points and two balanced hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|ugis: lets see how the rumanians handle it|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: @HJ the problem - in Cr S tryed @h9 but also @S here - only @h2/3 will give the message to N|pg||
nt|andyv:  you need to pick up the @s suit...only play that will do that is the J@s lead from S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think 3@D can achieve so much|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: might just get partner off to the wrong lead against hearts|pg||
nt|athene: north might double this for takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@S now - as in OR|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his side has slightly more than half the deck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D might be short, so maybe West cannot raise to 2@D (could be inverted) |pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: if partner has a heart stack there could be a number on offer|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s probably shows 4@s|pg||
nt|ricky86: shows 4 @s and a maximum hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same lead in OR.|pg||
nt|athene: in situations like this where it's overwhelmingly likely that the opponents are going to play it, your bids should probably be mostly lead-directing|pg||
nt|athene: mostly you expect pd to pull it but that will hopefully be ok|pg||
nt|ugis: most probably 4h on NS here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: ok, he feels that south bidding spades or diamonds is too likely, and too likely to be wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: perfect EW distribution, but with only 8 HCP difficult for W to invite for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  1@d as 3+ in standard French style?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: for me S sh pass over 3@s x - 4@D for extra values and no @S-stop|pg||

nt|hajru:  Yes, coffee time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  W needs to preserve the K@h in dummy.  He should tackle the @s suit now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I am impressed with the standard I must say. Excellent players, bright future|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it was hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not sure 2@H over 2@D in the other room was a very good bid|pg||

nt|athene: hop might lay down the @CK anyway for want of anything better to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are working hard to get many and good junior players all over the world. In Europe, the Netherlands, Poland and France are the strongest youth nations (then add Israel, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: playing in European events). No, I don't want to discuss politics, just stating a fact|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes, and it would have allowed north to lead a LOW spade against 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: and so avoid making the @S98xxx into a stopper|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if north had been able to show the 5-5 (ghestem, say) then EW might have ended up defending|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, it's possible e-w will be in 3nt at the other table. they do have a @S stopper, but the defence has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess if anyone is playing ghestem this match it will be france :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: so they will play my pd for the black queens?|pg||
nt|hedyg: CR by passing first and then showing the reds 5 5 is now in 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, it is an informational trade off|pg||

nt|oosb: yes, A@D lead and defence can get 2 ruffs + 2 more @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final, ARG URU are 3 up against NED RUM|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a good 4@h contract the EW may not get to|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, it is hard to see how to defeat this without getting a number of H tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Let's make a prediction - small swing to France on the 4@S-1 hand |pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  I wonder if 2@s is a one round force|pg||
nt|ricky86: maybe they can get if NS bid @ds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Absolutely one sided match so far.|pg||
nt|oosb: but without the dbl -400 actually gains against 650!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marginal opening bid by W, the French establishment might frown on it so perhaps not opened in the other room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: @d ruff will beat !3s on a ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  You're not looking at the other table, are you?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Since North jumped inn 3!n i would have played AKQ. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ricky86: 3@s is delicate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good spot reached by France in the other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, just this one|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: 5@C/5@D will cost 300 against 4 major, but with all green u normal not go for this save - but sometimes u can push opp to 5-level!!|pg||
nt|pelu: both Ns broke Rolands rule No 1 : no weak to with 2 Aces :)|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows a balanced hand south may go for the nine-trick game|pg||
nt|oosb: not an opening for me|pg||
nt|oosb: not even marginal for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you may have a career awaiting you in France:)|pg||
nt|oosb: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: i would, with 4333 and strength in all side suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most of the players at this table are unknown to me, but i know E fairly well --  one of USA's most promising juniors, Marius is a Romanian living in the US  and playing here on a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: largely Dutch team. this kind of ecumenical transnationalism is very good for bridge |pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk5: Indeed|pg||
nt|hajru:  And then what?  You know that partner cannot have much and even if you set up a 4th heart, how can you cash it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: I'd rather open 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D looks like an underbid if it isn't forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The trick is to avoid 3NT, and they did in both rooms. Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by both sides|pg||
nt|andyv:  E seems to have no problem in bidding with marginal hands|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@c = Gazzili. 2@d = 8+ hcp, 2@s = 5@h + 4@s 18+|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt could be a good hand, though, south might feel obliged to show the support in case they have slam|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 1nt with north, certainly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: as u understand, I dont agree with him :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Ricardo and Wubbo would u open 1@h or 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 3NT, have to bid.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  if north have A@c im hopeing to get inn on single @c K :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 1nt showing hearts and diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wboer: 6@c is a beauty, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|athene: another trick is to avoid 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why the double I wonder. He knows he will be on lead himself|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wboer: 4NT = NF, kanti|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed yes. with QJ@H falling.|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt - 3nt is a reasonable auction i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is itching to double, but the spectre of -470 is a forbidding vision|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|wboer: quantitative|pg||
nt|athene: against diamonds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ah sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I would rather be in 3nt than 4@S here, but they should make it either way|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|wboer: You have 11 toptricks with @c not 5/1. Enough entries to develop 5th @h or @dA good|pg||
nt|wboer: Well bid again by EW|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|oosb: lively auction here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wboer: I would open 1@h|pg||
nt|ricky86: i play 2@h 10-12 with 6 cards, but here i think is weak.. i don't agree|pg||
nt|ricky86: i would open 1 @h|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you have Ax of trumps you have to jump in with the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|athene: so as not to get endplayed later|pg||
nt|veistikke:  to cash the last @H :P|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: but i think west should be able to see that is not the issue on this hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: made easy.:)|pg||
nt|athene: not clear to run this because if you lose to west's queen, you just incurred an extra loser and you don't have anything so useful to throw on dummy's clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: even if he does, it's only an imp :)|pg||
nt|ugis: it is all about getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|ugis: must lead the diam Q from dummy|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|pelu: and give N @Hj 10 and not the Q would u still open 1@h|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: but one of the more embarrassing ones to concede|pg||
nt|athene: pitching a red card might be useful but it might not be|pg||
nt|ugis: well OK, must find the trump Q too, but it should not be a problem|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only complaint I have regarding these youngsters is that they double (lead-directing) way too much. Most of the time it helps the opponents more than partner|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W would have done better not to double 2C. he is dead minimum for an opener (if that) and his clubs are not all that great  -- and meanwhile  2C is the contract that suits ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him best|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oosb: Yes but after 1NT dbl, he perhaps expected 2@H to be dbled too?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should perhaps have led a trump, and W should perhaps have switched to diamonds at trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but is it so clear that he wants to defend 2HX rather than 2C undoubled?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ugis: apparently I might be wrong again :)|pg||
nt|ugis: but I guess he will still play it from the top|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|athene: yes, we have seen lots of lead doubles in the last few days|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|oosb: that's a good question :)|pg||
nt|ugis: the more you think in those situations, the more likely it is that you will go for the percentage play|pg||
mc|9|nt|ugis: I mean if you "feel" that the Q is with E, you do not think, you finesse in tempo :)|pg||
nt|ugis: after two non-vulnerable game swings we see France 1 IMPahead|pg||

nt|wboer: nothing to be ashamed off. Two aces in defense. This is better then a flat 12 hcp|pg||
nt|ricky86: y|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italian top guns hardly ever double, and there is a good reason for it|pg||
nt|athene: i think i have seen one of about eight that was useful for the defence|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, the French picked up 5 on the 4@s -1 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT making by South on 22 - 5 to France|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  our first slam|pg||
nt|pelu: so u open on 9+ - is that on your CC?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: better check my lottery numbers|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: I hears this beautifull 6@c will losse 2 imps, because the open room are in 6@h. With bare @hQJ this makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a very strong result for the Dutch|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: There are problem with running score - prob so many try to enter, that the server cant manage|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR board 8 the contract is 6@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For a start, you have to bid 3NT, and then make it if you do|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: does 1@C promise four clubs? rare these days|pg||
mb|2D|nt|wboer: my cc is secret|pg||
nt|kakashi84: no 1@c promise 3 @c|pg||
nt|ugis: 3h?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk5: I would upgrade to 10, so yes, 10-21 is on my CC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another double coming|pg||
nt|kakashi84: I think, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and then Poulat has to decide|pg||
nt|athene: west could have bid 3@D but he prefers to wait for his partner's second double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  safest slam is 6N|pg||
nt|ugis: 2H certainly too pesimistic for me|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would be lebensohl i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt is a reasonable punt|pg||
nt|bobholl: at other vulnarabilty he'd have passed i guess 98 are pretty :)|pg||
nt|athene: AK98 a lot nicer than AK87! one trick nicer in fact :)|pg||
nt|athene: guaranteed a double stop|pg||
nt|athene: sorry triple stop|pg||
nt|ugis: 6-4, a terrific 15 points....somewhere between 3 and 4 hearts for me..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk5: Did you give up on tournament bridge completely, Wubbo? We don't see you any more|pg||
nt|rnmalik: late:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy to beat this|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: wd by EW there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: dont be wrong - they can play bridge "down under" :)|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs: lead @D :)|pg||
nt|wboer: I play the nice festivals in europe and some leage bridge in Holland Also coach/captain with my wife Agnes of this Dutch juniors|pg||
nt|hajru:  As I'm rooting for the Dutch, 16 flat boards is good for the result|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reasonable lead. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: many players would open 2N on the S hand, but that would be ill-advised on a hand that is so well-sculpted for play in a suit|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead|pg||
nt|wboer: There is a loosing option in 6@h after @dA and @d. Enter dummy with @d ruff to play for @hQJx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, we can see that it can be set, but it is very tough at the table|pg||
nt|athene: that's a vital tempo given away|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: imo @C lead in that hand would create problems for 6@H.|pg||
nt|hajru:  but I guess the specs don't like it. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|ricky86: shared lead but there isn't a problem for declarer|pg||
nt|wboer: @h lead will beat it. Taking @sA and @h switch will make life diff for decl. He still makes it because the block in @h|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: and now it's too late already|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: north, reasonably enough, excpected much better clubs for 3@C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ricky86: yes, no problems here for NS. they have 6@c 6@h and 6NT :)|pg||
nt|ugis: but on the actual layout, declarer soon will have a big smile|pg||

nt|ugis: in the open room S going 2 down in 4h dbld|pg||
nt|ugis: so 9 more imps to France|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: south might underlead the hearts i suppose but that still nets only four tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @H ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: When I was a junior boards with only a single-figure swing rated as flat|pg||

pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: but as for identical auctions, maybe someone will open 2N|pg||

nt|hajru:  That is so long ago, that I can't remember|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I didn't really want to add that |pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: if south had not raised clubs and it had gone, say, 1nt - 3nt, then north might lead the @HQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: plod away at spades sry|pg||

nt|athene: i think actually you are safer overcalling at the 1-level with a very strong hand than at the 2-level|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|athene: because the auction is way less likely to die|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: sure, north probably can bid 3@C anyway|pg||

nt|athene: since the @HK is overwhelmingly likely to be in dummy|pg||
nt|warrens:  but E might have claimed a little early|pg||
nt|athene: that is a 1@H opener for most in this event, i suspect|pg||
nt|veistikke:  South can also duck the @H |pg||
nt|hajru:  Rehi, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: on raw loser count, it is a 3H bid, but with 3 aces and only one queen, it is adjusted to a 4H call. unless of course one has alternative ways to show a hand worth 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  got disconnected but it looks as if I didn't miss much.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: After all, game is on a finesse|pg||
nt|athene: what will east rebid after 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 3@s?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  anyone got link to the results?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ricky86: Donati-Percario play a very good bridge for their age. I should mention that Donati is 13 yo and Percario is 16 yo :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East had @CJ instead of the 10, 4@S can be defeated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as it is, 5@C is a correct save|pg||
nt|athene: NS do well to "take the money" here since pressing on to 5@S would lead to a negative score|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many french players have various calls available as opener to distinguish different types of raises to 4H|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: i would go for 2nt i think|pg||
nt|bobholl: now you misdescribe you hand always :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course, agonized pause and self-recrimination for opening in the first place is a reasonable option|pg||
nt|athene: and it looks as though east is going for that :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wboer: What should N bid? Pass is ok imo|pg||
nt|athene: you might not be too happy taking a probable 500 against your vul game, but you don't want to go for "650 or maybe -100" instead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and in other lands too as well|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wboer: strange but winning because @dA is wrong. Do they play a strong @c system?|pg||
nt|pelu: they prob play 2@S contructiv and he didnt like to bid 1NF (forsing - semiforcing)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: has no choice.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a very pure hand here and imagines short spades with partner so will sac i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: also 5@C takes blackwood away from north|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: because it uses up SO much room|pg||
nt|athene: when the auction gets icky like this, it's a good idea to favour the cheaper bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but Australia need 19-11 to pass Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If they do, West'|pg||
nt|Walddk5: s hand is worth a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: which might be what he is about to bid|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qtournid=897&qphase=SF&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|ugis: 6clubs on a finesse...down 1 |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, surprised|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be getting old - prefer 2@c to 2@d|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt also down|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|warrens:  the other option is 2nt, which is tough on Jxx.  I actually don't like 1@H very much, unless playing a strong club.|pg||
nt|bobholl: which is 2NT but with Jxx i can't like that too :)|pg||
nt|athene: a spec comments that if you can't stomach 2nt, 3@S must be better than 3@H, which seems right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect that the vulnerability here has been an inhibiting factor. for example, at favorable colors N (though not a french N) might overcall 1D|pg||
nt|ugis: 4h an interesting contract, 5c = nothing interesting :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rnmalik: 10@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Pity if partner had @CJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dan Neill|pg||

nt|hajru:  Hi Dan|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andyv:  that is good to know|pg||
nt|wboer: 3NT will make. N won't lead a @c|pg||
nt|ricky86: good contract 4@s but unlucky|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: good contract with the double fit|pg||
nt|ugis: 6h = too much luck needed|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: 21-count 3NT - and it looks like it will make |pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Diamond to the ace, diamond ruff, club to the jack, diamond ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  5 clubs and 4 red suit winners.|pg||
nt|ugis: after the diamond lead 6h makes I guess :)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|ricky86: they are the future of Italy bridge :)|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  N will probably run a C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though there is some work to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|veistikke:  5@c and 5@h and 1 @d :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and EW can't take three spade tricks, unless North misguesses - unlikely|pg||
nt|djneill:  seems like West can only hope that North has at most 5@c, 2@d, and one @h, so continuing diamonds might be best|pg||
nt|veistikke:  would be normal. but north is getting 11 if west continues inn @d |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|pelu: no update on running score after 3 boards of this match|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hajru:  That would give him something like xxx/AJxxx/AJx/xx and that is not a 2N rebid|pg||
nt|ugis: DA, Club A and a club = |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: in some situations like this, i think that opener's cue should not be strong|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: it should just say "i have no bid"|pg||
nt|athene: typically a weak notrump with no stop|pg||
pc|h7|nt|djneill:  well North could have the @sK, but cannot establish it|pg||
nt|hajru:  South gives up ;)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|wboer: This will be 9 or 11 imp's back to japan|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ugis: but it is double dummy of course :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: the trump play is more or less clearcut , when opps have ten diamonds and never bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: let's say for example you open 1@D, 1@S overcall, 2@H from your pd|pg||
nt|veistikke:  now 12|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: nice try - but no succes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oosb: +1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oosb: 4 more boards in the first session of this final. Total 4 sessions of 14 boards each|pg||
nt|oosb: or is it different for 3/4?|pg||
nt|oosb: 3 sessions I'm told since this is 3rd/4th |pg||
nt|oosb: Ah and the room title reads 1/3 dohh|pg||
nt|oosb: Are they taking a break?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this has been a relatively quiet match so far, for this age group...only a couple of big hands|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|athene: now it makes a lot of sense for your 2@S to just say "i  have no support, no rebid, no stop"|pg||

nt|marlowepi: frail|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy slam, whats the problem??:):)|pg||
nt|athene: west worried that doubling might induce his partner to do something rash in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: like bid them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, he has bad alternatives|pg||
nt|athene: plus @SKx sort of is better not being led through|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: a difficult hand on this lead|pg||
nt|athene: declarer doesn't know the @HJ and @CJ are so obliging|pg||

nt|ugis: have to run, thx all|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S not so bad here but hard to find with two balanced hands|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ricky86: interesting hand now|pg||
nt|athene: west will super-accept spades i guess despite nasty 4333|pg||
nt|athene: you have to do something with 17 count and 4 trumps don't you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 17 with 4 is enough|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: EW won't be nearly sure enough that 4@H is making|pg||
nt|athene: even if it gets bid, which is not certain|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 3@H in the other room was showing a good hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|oosb: Ferro and Scanavino stopped in 2NT on board 9, while the other table in the final also played 4@H-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wubbo; 2Nt?|pg||
nt|athene: then east will bash the game in|pg||
nt|oosb: is it just me or the 1NT overcall is scary?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: I can take a nap now|pg||
nt|athene: even if you play that 2nt is a scramble in that sort of position, you can still use that as "good bad" in the highest-ranking suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: which is very useful|pg||
nt|hajru:  Gazilli again, 2N showing a strong 5-5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards seem very NS this set, and to be fair NS are doing vey well with them|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and down they will go :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Helmich has a cleardouble now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4333 hands really ARE that evil|pg||
nt|djneill:  North asks for the 2nd suit, expecting @d...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wboer: 2NT is limit+ with @s support|pg||
nt|ricky86: construct?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here:)|pg||
nt|athene: because if south had a weak 3@H bid he would bid 2nt scramble and pull whatever his partner bid, to 3@H|pg||
nt|djneill:  but..|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk5: Could be a Fantunes gadget, limit with 3|pg||
nt|athene: so a direct 3@H always shows something|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ricky86: bad choice bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d bit a bit over the top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that nowadays penalty doubles do not exist below 7@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quite sure no @C lead and @S guess will let it make|pg||
nt|athene: yeah you can get two clubs away on the hearts - but why should you play the spades right?|pg||
nt|bobholl: or no @C switch now |pg||
nt|oosb: One probably cant afford to pass but against a passed pd it is scary|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wboer: Yes limit with 3 @s|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 3@S pretty much forces NS into 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything is for take-out. The doubles just have various names, but 'penalty' is not among them|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer doesn't have easy communication, but he can make this if S ducks|pg||
nt|athene: even if south flies the ace, it's not obvious to play a club|pg||
nt|athene: could look very silly a lot of the time |pg||
nt|warrens:  no, but another @D is sufficient|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer has the ace|pg||
nt|athene: yes, ace and diamond works ok|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: limit I can for sure see - and only 3 card @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  A of @D and a @H is dangerous for the defense|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|djneill:  should South have just bid RKC after 4@h?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: yes - an "optional" double these days means "you can pull it to your suit, or to my suit" :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  He is close, I think.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|veistikke:  most people would have :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on this sequence, North does not guarantee four trumps, I imagine - South is 5/5+|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|veistikke:  but 4@h is a good bid|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|ricky86: another hand without story|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|veistikke:  nothing to play now :) 12 :P|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: should get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|athene: he knows west has a lot more diamonds than east|pg||
pc|c8|nt|warrens:  Now, declarer has to pitch 2 @C's and then play a @C to dummy |pg||
pc|cT|nt|hajru:  but doesn't have to make a foreward move on, say, xx/Qxx/Axxx/xxxx? over 3@h|pg||

nt|athene: there is a case for any one of the four suits|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: hearts likely to be best but which one to lead? meanwhile any suit could be right|pg||
nt|athene: people often try the queen from that suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if your are going to lead a D, the queen has a good deal going for it|pg||
nt|athene: and indeed here that would be ok|pg||
nt|athene: yes @DQ can work out nicely|pg||
nt|athene: but can also look very foolish|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bill i am not used to us thinking alike twice in a row. we should both b very afraid:)|pg||
nt|athene: a lot depends on whether 1@C can be any weak notrump|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: or whether EW prefer 1@D with real diamonds and min balanced|pg||
nt|athene: if the former, i would probably go for the club|pg||

nt|athene: i don't like leading away from any risky 4-card suit like the hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here it is not so clear, but in general when you have the majority of the defensive assets it is attractive to lead high from shoirtish suits. leading low only increases the chance ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you will be endplayed later. and often you want partner to be on lead later for a specific reason (as here) -- so if you burn his side honor at trick one he doesnt get in. finally, ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: On the surface you make slam with this fortunate trump split, but a diamond lead puts an end to that|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: board 26 next in the Open Room. That result could be vital|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  this time only one suit for slam|pg||
nt|pelu: our friend from japan could jump to 3@H in OR|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Not a gross overbid|pg||
nt|ricky86: the problems of these hands is stay awake :)|pg||
nt|pelu: here 2@S ask: do u have a opening hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You would also bid 2@H with one spade more and one diamond less|pg||
nt|wboer: In 6@s S has a natural @cQ lead for 1 down|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is too funny for words if it is true|pg||

nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|oosb: although|pg||
nt|oosb: with KQ@H missing they might not bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i think S should bid it, especially since he has chosen to sue KC|pg||
nt|oosb: Is a 7 card fit though, but could be missing AQ@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: use|pg||
nt|oosb: I meant 9 card fit|pg||
nt|oosb: 7 card suit!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view, if he bids 5H here, he is saying he wanted to be in slam only if facing AK|pg||
nt|oosb: I guess it depends to some extent on preempt styles too? vul against not 3@H might be on the heavy side and atlesat have a decent suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: and this West hand is considerably better|pg||
nt|athene: the italians do prefer opening the major on these|pg||
nt|djneill:  think it asks partner to bid your doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't know why they hate 1nt so much|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: exactly. Therefore this 2@s relay|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 6+ suit GF. 3NT = serious slamtry|pg||

nt|athene: but those are not problems that you need in the first place :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosb: 75% or so to pick up trumps?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|warrens:  so,did this sequence show an invitational hand by S?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: many flat bords here in 2. segment - in the other 3 matches max swing is 7 IMP|pg||
nt|wboer: I don't know if this is a good convention. You are good in the slamzone, but you tell much to defenders if you are in the limitzone|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yes, but I think you need it if you allow 3-card raises|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I do with a 5431 hand for example|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok East has a good idea where all the HCP are, esp since South did not lead a club (so North has a top club and @sQ)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: next please.|pg||
nt|athene: i am assuming this was a 2-way checkback auction|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like a reasonable way to overcome the problem|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: go lebatteux!|pg||
nt|bobholl: despite 26 points not so easy :)|pg||
nt|athene: @H10 comes down|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|wboer: 4NT = optional Blackwood. So 5@c=min, 5@d = 1/4, 5@h= 0/3, 5@s= 2 no @sQ, 5NT= 2 with @sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 8 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 400 is cheap|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes it's good|pg||
nt|athene: ...and laughing at every 50, as we used to say at university|pg||
nt|kakashi84: -9 possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah, he has 2 tricks already, but was indeed possible|pg||
nt|athene: it's still not that huge a gain, but worth a lot psychologically|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: but still - if east leads a spade after the @HK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|warrens:  yes, with the J of @h's not, this should be easy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: i guess you are ok|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: the defence might get the red kings and two spades but that is all|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|warrens:  West just didn't have enough to X for a @S lead|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|pelu: 3 card raise for me only if i dont have a better bid - with Hx in @S and 3 card @H I bid 1NT every time|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ricky86: too much defeatist France here|pg||
nt|athene: sorry - he doesn't even need the diamond finesse if he gets a spade|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h7|nt|djneill:  or not|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|warrens:  if W sticks in the 8 now, he can get endplayed |pg||
nt|athene: he can afford to take it though - the defence can't cash three more spades when starting from west|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: What do you bid with   x  Axx  AQJ10x  xxxx|pg||
nt|wboer: True, you should, but leading for opp is easier now.|pg||
nt|athene: he might simply run the hearts now and hope to endplay west in the pointed suits|pg||
nt|warrens:  whoops.  why wont North ever lead @C's?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: lead the @DQ was better|pg||
nt|athene: more likely to smoke out the king|pg||
nt|athene: if east doesn't cover the jack that doesn't mean much|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|warrens:  but the finesse is also reasonable, since now W has to cash out to prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|athene: if he doesn't cover the queen - that is a stronger indication|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but once you led the diamond you are sort of committed i suppose|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|hT|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: west doesn't cash out, hoping that his partner has a heart spot or something?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think that was so ridiculous but it sure didn't work out well, declarer just leading to his ten for a ninth trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: suddenly NEDRUM have opened a substantial lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: every time i hear "nedrum" i think of the film "the shining" - it's very scary|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: neither pair playing forcing notrump - another big difference between europe and USA methods|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: "semi-forcing notrump" much more popular over here|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: if you take your 3-card raises and your heart hands out of 1NT there is much less need to keep the bidding open|pg||

nt|marlowepi: most of the top US players have given up forcing NT, but it is still fairly common at rank&file level|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: that's how the italian pairs have been playing for quite a while|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: some spectators might be wondering what "semi-forcing notrump" means and whether it's anything like being "slightly pregnant"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: the basic idea is, you respond 1nt on any hand that does not have a fit and is not game forcing|pg||
nt|athene: so you still play 2/1 game force|pg||
nt|athene: but partner can pass 1nt with a balanced minimum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are degrees of pregnancy, as any legislator can tell you|pg||

nt|bobholl: well he didn't costing (may be) 1 imp|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|wboer: Easy to bid and easy to make 3NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: is 1@S a forcing notrump here or is Hop just saying "anything you can do..."?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think East was a little quick with the @D 9.  did he think S led low twice from J10xxx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Its very close - 2@H could sill be a minimun 2-4-4-3 hand so 2@C for sure an option|pg||
nt|ricky86: nice hand here|pg||
nt|athene: i would overcall 1@s with the east cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: A style issue. I would rebid a 'normal' !2c|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Was gonna write the same|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5C is an enterprising call. E should pass here|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|wboer: although communications are not optimal|pg||
nt|athene: not sure how much more Bernard needs - probably not much|pg||
nt|warrens:  also, without @C's ever being led, it was likely that North had some @C honor|pg||
nt|veistikke:  should top the @d|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: some pairs swap the meaning of 1@S and 1NT in response to 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: most common is that 1@S can be up to 4 spades and 1NT is 5+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Kaplan inversion|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, I think declarer can assume @c AQ with S, @cK with N.  Otherwise S would have led one|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|ricky86: good lead by S|pg||
nt|ricky86: almost unavoidable|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told 1@S is indeed system not a psyche|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead should beat this i suppose|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 26 was flat - well done at the other table too |pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should reflect that he has subpar trumps and W did not cuebid 4D, so W may be taking a shot with 5C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: declarer is going to just take the club finesse and lose the @CK and four spades|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, I think N did well to bid over 2@c from S.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: unless EW have agreements to the contrary, W could bid 4D then 5C to show slam-friendly values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, one understands the powerful temptation to bid six -- that will be a good contract facing as little as:    x    xx    Axx    xxxxxxx|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|wboer: The double in the open room is not clever, although you have 2 tricks with (3rd hand) openend partner. You tell the opps to much.|pg||
nt|athene: he can run the diamonds first but that shouldn't put the defenders under much pressure|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: very agressiv X by N in OR - spec when up with a lot|pg||
nt|pelu: sometimes down 1, but N cant exp down 2, so the D only a help for decl|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|s2|pg||

pc|s6|nt|Walddk5: :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|warrens:  this is a good start, but not enough. |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h4|nt|athene: we can see here that playing the diamonds doesn't achieve much, but in general, it's a good thing to do, if you don't need your solid suit for entries |pg||
pc|d3|nt|ricky86: yes, even in a mitchell i didn't bid dbl. too many informations for opp's and few aces :)|pg||
nt|wboer: The match is getting closer now. 10 tricks but -9 imp's|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: quite often one or both defenders gets squeezed, or thinks he does, and throws something he shouldn't|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2N!|an|minors|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: south was no doubt intending to follow up with 3@H if his partner bid 3 of a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: just saying "i have a good hand pd, do something intelligent"|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|athene: what a delicious @H10 :)|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room was somewhat bizarre|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: is that like "somewhat pregnant"?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: in one way, the disaster in the other room goes to prove your point about overcalling a heavy 2@C on  24 rather than doubling|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: if you double without support for a high-ranking suit partner might bid (or jump in)|pg||
nt|athene: then the bidding gets very high very fast|pg||
nt|athene: and you can easily come unstuck|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what can be said uncontroversially is that it is an extremely crucial (=very pregnant)  area for ironclad partnership understandings|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: well it has cost the france NS pair two big swings; they will be doing some earnest thinking on that topic i am sure|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are routinely so many IMPs at stake on hands/auctions of this type that it is whooly essential (completely pregnant) to know exactly what you are doing|pg||

nt|hajru:  Well played by N but he eventually ran out of high cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: france has hope for a swing there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  board 11 proved to be very expensive as 4@s failed in OR|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is a good Dutch result|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NED RUM on a roll against ARG URU in the other semi-final, now 32 up|pg||
nt|athene: wow - this isn't at all the classic french style of pre-emption|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand, |pg||
nt|athene: another 1nt opener for me|pg||
mb|d|nt|wboer: Open 3NT in wrong hand. Can EW avoid this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and remember the 3NT - no play with @C first or sekund time - price 12 IMP!|pg||
nt|athene: i would have overcalled 3@c with the south cards|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: thin, but i have a 1@C opener, just about, and i am short in hearts so partner might be a bit stuck sometimes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice Roland 7@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: me too Jx and Qx are good cards to have|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: or 7@s, or 7NT, for that matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: very good result in open room. 4@h is down with a @s ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Can 4@H make on a spade lead?|pg||
mb|6D|nt|Walddk5: snap|pg||
nt|rnmalik: played by W has a chance.|pg||
nt|wboer: No they can't|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: Delle Cave surely doesn't even thought to bid 5@d at board 11|pg||
nt|athene: south now wondering if this is just "equal level conversion" (he passes) or showing a really big hand (he might do something)|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like they play fast arrival, so 4@S shows a minimum|pg||
nt|hajru:  If you bid slams like that, you might as well go for 7N|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: buying it in 4@H in the other room was huge|pg||
nt|athene: but i would not bother with stayman with the east hand, probably - i would just bid 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i like auctions that go 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: but than you get a @H lead :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, this sequence told the world that west has 4 spades and east has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt - 3nt, that's the way to go|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk5: Even on a non-spade lead, 4@H was a lucky make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: south was a bit wet there, i think - pass first time, give pd a single raise and then subside?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|Walddk5: Needed diamonds to come in for 1 loser|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so sometimes the lead in your major was actually better for the defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wboer: E can lead a @c and then you have 10 tricks with the nice @d break|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why not 4@S and @D ace. A possibility.|pg||
nt|athene: but not so often|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: NS favorites to make 3N|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|athene: it has to be right in the long run not to tell them so much|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ricky86: good def by EW|pg||
nt|pelu: can u makle 2Nt now? better take the first @C and play @hs - then u can overtake @SQ - run the @Hs and play @d|pg||
nt|ricky86: yes, was better taking with ace on lead|pg||
nt|hajru:  The French bid 6@h on 27, off 2 aces.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|h3|nt|pelu: back to OR: strange lead - East cant expt that his partner has a fast entry, so dont play for ruff, play for ruff to partner|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|athene: well, he makes six if the clubs run|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|athene: gets both spades away in time|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|athene: hoping east doesn't ruff this|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: ok, doesn't hurt to make them defend correctly :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd that N ruffed D before drawing last trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: france has almost drawn level now on the two slam hands  --  NEDRUM somewhat surprisingly stayed out of the good slam on  12 in the Open Room, and France stayed out of the failing ...|pg||
