nt|ianmcc: I think @d9 promotes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: to open S or not?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzjh: they just informed me they change the system with vulnerabiity and this is precision modified|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Precision might help E/W keep low|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand for competition...NS make at most 8 tricks in any contract...but have 23 HCP...they will feel like trying for a game..let us see|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|strike12: To all Kibs, since being a Pairs Tournament, there are no comparisions shown as results will be posted at finish of all tables. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: good decision|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats my formula for balancing when they havent found a fit = " dont"|pg||
nt|panja: good pass by Rajesh..|pg||
nt|panja: are they playing prec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 3N is making double dummy|pg||
nt|panja: easier in Precision...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|strike12: 4@c might be FIT showing with @d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h close but diamonds nasty|pg||
nt|psridhar: are we going to witness a lightner X of 6@H here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Venky is fearless balancer otherwise|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ianmcc: 3NT might have made here|pg||
nt|twcho: east will be thrown in in @s and give a @d to south at the end|pg||
nt|panja: of course..this is not a good contract..2@H is better...but most likely in @H they would have gone too far...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzjh: all bids were alerted |pg||
nt|psridhar: possibly without the lightner it is easier to beat slam|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that would help make it|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|babs59: and board 1 reflects that policy too|pg||
