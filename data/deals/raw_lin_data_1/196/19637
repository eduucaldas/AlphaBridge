mc|11|nt|athene: if you are worried that the contract might actually make, you don't lead the singleton|pg||

mb|2S|nt|minimeck: this will concern them, however, they verywell might end up in 4M|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|minimeck: in the other room Bos took the non 1NT route and has landed in 3c, will be a swing one way or the other, will need some defensive help here to make 4h, even with trumps 3-3 |pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok name corrected. thanks to our operator Eria :)|pg||
nt|ugis: the off-shape nt makes the defending harder|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: HI|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||
nt|athene: just lose the sixth club most of the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you need to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|mrdct: moysian 6@d here|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a big fan of that sort of thing though|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: it helps if you can make unusual notrump bids later in the auction with confidence partner will know you are showing diamonds of course :)|pg||

nt|kemperg: Hi henry|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: 3nt extremely unlikely to be the best contract when you have such a shapely two-suiter|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: 3nt is for balanced hands and one-suiters|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, agreed, very suprising, especially if 3h was a cue|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kemperg: good bidding NOT to be in 3NT:(|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: was 2NT just general good/bad?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ybob: un claro paso de W que será penalizado !|pg||
nt|ferlema: la defensa debe tener cuidado en no bloquear el corazon|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: 6NT right sided here|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|ybob: es necesario tomar y continuar para derrotar|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|galois85: it seems -1 by guessing the @dj |pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps the operator could inform us of the alerts|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might not realise they have any diamond fit at all - he might just think 2nt was showing a competitive 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES IT WAS|pg||
nt|athene: i would just rebid 3@D with the east hand, and if i get too high, so be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: west explained it could be weak with clubs or some good hands|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||

nt|henryb:  now he will make 5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|minimeck: an immediate answer for the US, EW have bid to 6@d after a 3h overcall and 4d bid|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|h4|nt|mrdct: undo that - the @s hook and @c break are only good for 10 tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Can a woman be semi-pregnant? No, either she is or she is not, and either a bid is forcing or it is not|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|galois85: Dbl  at first round shows 4@s+ 1@s is a sputnik dbl without spades ( of mancinelli I mean)|pg||

nt|ferlema: debería perder una baza por palo|pg||
nt|henryb:  means partner can pass with balanced 11-13, but can bid 3 card minor with constructive hand, Roland|pg||
nt|gsper:  Sounds much like Culbertson and Goren played it.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|Walddk5: take a card away from a minor|pg||
nt|henryb:  down to 20%, and that only with misdefense: needs @hA onside doubleton and that N doesn't give a ruff with the @hA|pg||

pc|c6|nt|pelu: Andrea, can u tell us about the players - I exp that the 2 italian teams here are 2.. 3. or 4. best?|pg||

nt|henryb:  clubs, as Edgar Kaplan said, were relegated to the trash heap in the 40's already. We don't bid no steenkin clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Right, dump Stayman|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|minimeck: 1@c = 16+ any shape, x by lean is exactly 6-7|pg||
nt|gsper:  But the Italians have sort of revived club slams.|pg||
nt|henryb:  clubs as natural, that is. See Gazzilli, Stayman, Drury|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|mrdct: EW trying for 3NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: giuseppe is now responsible for youth  in italy|pg||

nt|athene: you might throw him in with a heart to lead a club|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, and that is where the open room has arrived, we shall see how it goes|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4@H looks like cold, but Uluer's need play carefuly , if he quess to AJ doubletone @d can make plus trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but i think the defence should prevail |pg||
nt|ferlema: si, estan todas las cartas bien puestas|pg||

mb|6H|nt|galois85: Giuseppe is also watching the match at this table|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Yeah, maybe|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|mrdct: as it happens a passive @d lead may have been best to let declarer do all of the work|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: why not 3x@H and then @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: treating the hand too strong for a 1nt opener, the inevitable contract, a chance for a well deserved pickup|pg||

pc|h7|nt|Walddk5: After 10 rounds, top 8 advance to the quarter-finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|gsper:  Top honour, acc to another kib.|pg||

pc|h4|nt|pelu: 5@H: woid-wood - asking for Aces outside @h|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|halila: another heart game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s loses a @d and a @c and possibly a @h depending on how you play that suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: a shoulder shrugging pass from dwyer, at these colors he expects a normalish opener from p, but still nothing to bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: same contract both tables should be flat|pg||
nt|rensph: If XX shows an honour, you shouldn't redouble with the queen imo. Don't want partner to have to guess whether to lead his AJxxx|pg||

pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: i thought turkey was ahead before we crashed|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mrdct: but stripping @c and and easy endplay with guarantee 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: same 5@h in CR - and 5@s by N|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: so the plan will be to draw trumps, ruff a @c and then play @DAKx to endplay either opponent|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|mrdct: can actually claim on this line after drawing 1 round of trumps|pg||

nt|kemperg: in a @C contract, see discussion before:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: borderline decision for west over 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: play 4@S or make a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|ybob: otro 3NT sin problema |pg||
mb|2S|nt|rensph: S is in 3@HX on this board in the other room.... might get bloody|pg||
mb|d|nt|halila: ý think it is wrongly written|pg||
nt|athene: now opener has room to bid 4@H to show a good hand for spades i guess|pg||
nt|athene: he has mostly "hard" cards, so he might do that|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: despite having only two spades|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS likely here|pg||
nt|athene: quite control-rish|pg||
nt|athene: rich|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKQ doubleton, which was the flaw when he opened, is suddenly worth a lot|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt looks a bit much, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: apart from anything, the limited hand isn't normally the one to take control|pg||
nt|athene: not in well-controlled auctions anyway :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Bos will have to activate his sonar and find the diamond jack :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|halila: it can be down with a careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamonds 5-1 means the limit of hand is 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: interesting that NS put balanced 20-counts into their 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: what to bid in S - 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: and is 2Nt naturel or for minor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  E-W here could save the day by reaching and making 6@c|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk5: Is it necessary to jump to 4@H?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: south may solve that problem for him at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: difficult - i guess if you want to be passive, a trump lead is preferable|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea tough lead problem for lien, trump club, diamond?|pg||
nt|minimeck: trump seems the safest, not going to pick off pard with q@s :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you operator, yes, :) k@h not possible|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: diamond might well find partner's honour for them; i like a trump here, although you don't usually lead a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: @HK into a 2nt opener....hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but 3|pg||
nt|athene: as a rule, it's right to lead aggressively against 6 of a suit, but this auction might be an exception|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt on here, but probably hard to bid|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h looks doomed, though - No Roland, its not.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct: the @h7 is a big card here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt better than 3@C - West can get 2@d ruffs|pg||
nt|galois85: yes... 2nt I think is natural|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this would slowly end up in 4@S. ..  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - where did East get that 3@H from?|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason you would lead a heart is to set up a trick fast before declarer throws heart losers on a side suit|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, definetely merit to leading the heart|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: that is unlikely to be the issue here|pg||
nt|gsper:  And NS in 3@H at other table? Sounds like the Menagerie.|pg||
nt|henryb:  only if both tables make the contract :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: @D8: signal for @s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: as is the @h6|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|halila: is tkere any way to confuse the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Diamond switch may be needed now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: To force declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk5: All academic with the 1400 from the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now he can win in dummy and take the club finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  still 3 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and he retains control|pg||
nt|Walddk5: as he no longer can be forced|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 4: difference between 17 and 13|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|halila: there|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: i doubt it|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: Pionto just dropped at trick|pg||
nt|athene: but of course it's easy to construct layouts where a heart is the only lead to beat|pg||
pc|c2|nt|minimeck: 26 imp swing coming|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ugis: however, if 1s = 11-15, w might bid on over 1nt. And then they would reach 3nt |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can ruff the long heart good but he still has to get to hand to cash it|pg||
nt|minimeck: alot of options now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|animeshraj: really|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: @C9 looks the least useful card from the easy hand|pg||

nt|minimeck: if this were the open event, we'd now see a 5-10 minute tank|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|athene: diamond back right now|pg||
nt|minimeck: 20 seconds and there it is|pg||
nt|athene: but it's too late|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: declarer now has to decide whether to finesse or play to bring the heart down but whatever he chooses will work|pg||
nt|minimeck: seems he's just got to go with the odds here|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: ned young a chance to get a donut in this match|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: he hoped that south would win the @DA and leave him with some options|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Misdefend and gain 13 IMPs :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Never happens to me :(|pg||
nt|gsper:  That is how I get most of my big gains:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Because you are a churlish old man (like me) rather than a sunny youngster|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@H is on|pg||
nt|Walddk5: what about 7@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  50% or so|pg||
nt|henryb:  makes on this layout|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, but less than 50 %|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|galois85: 4@h for n/s in OR|pg||
nt|athene: everyone can quieten down now with a boring 3nt|pg||
nt|henryb:  actually a little better|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2S|nt|mrdct: 4@h makes NS here|pg||
nt|ybob: 8 bazas es el límite en @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  minimally better|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@C hearts?|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec tells 52.5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hearts confirmed|pg||
nt|gsper:  A low trump lead might beat 7@D;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@H showing 4 spades or 6+?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|halila: no problem  on 3nt|pg||
nt|ugis: 4s a good sacrifice here against 4h|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, no, because you lose to QJ doubleton in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2 club transfer for hearts|pg||
nt|kemperg: swithces must used by the younger Dutch ( and an older one like me:))|pg||
nt|henryb:  you gain against stiff Q or J in the same hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 6@H now practical bridge, or even 6@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can forget about science|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: i know what i will lead as south|pg||
nt|pelu: look at that over 2@D on a very bad 5 card suit - not in my book - do u like that overcall?|pg||
nt|athene: if he bids 3nt now he shows just choice of games?|pg||
nt|ybob: se gana 4@H E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|animeshraj: wow thats some pass...|pg||
nt|ugis: and I would bid 4s as E|pg||
nt|henryb:  The earth is flat, and created in 6 days in 4004 BC|pg||
pc|sK|nt|halila: a flat bord|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting methods but the normal contract non-theless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: exactly four spades|pg||
nt|athene: there is some merit to this sort of thing, the idea being to conceal from the defenders whether declarer has four hearts|pg||
nt|athene: since that isn't of any interest to east|pg||
nt|kemperg: will play @D to the Ace|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: IF i was forced to bid I would X - but a clæear pass for me|pg||
nt|athene: some would achieve a similar result using 2nt as puppet e.g. 2nt 3@C [no 5major] now 3@H showing four spades|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ugis: normally 1s=5+ so with an 11 card fit EW should be rather comfortable in 4s|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: or 3@C as puppet often same sort of thing|pg||

nt|moonbeam42:  2N = natural and forcing?|pg||

nt|kemperg: 1 and 2nd hand green againt red|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: double alerted because it's 4 or 5 spades?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: mirrored @d layout here is bad for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: can only make 2@h|pg||
nt|galois85: maybe 4 spades and a club I would think about bidding a dbl (maybe I would not...but was possible) but in this situation easy pass|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally it would show precisely 4, but especially when the 1@D can be short, you want 1@S as a general t/o without spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5@d now by lien|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W gana 4@H por 2da vez consecutiva|pg||

pc|c7|nt|mrdct: on this lead a @d loser goes on the @SAk|pg||
nt|ugis: 3c from N slowed down S|pg||
nt|ugis: not such an easy contract due to communication problems and bad breaks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: 4-1-5-3 and 10+ ok for a TO D|pg||
nt|athene: looks like par|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H making exactly, this is one down|pg||
nt|ybob: en realidad hay pocas perdedoras pero no son seguras 10 bazas en 4@H|pg||
pc|c4|nt|halila: now 4h played by right side|pg||
nt|animeshraj: west hand doesnot warrant a cue IMO.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  Germ, are the youngsters afraid of having their bidding boxes taken away when they get over 30, so they have to get all their lifetime bids in before then? :_|pg||
nt|kemperg: suppose so :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, they just don't have any pass cards in them|pg||
nt|gsper:  When they are 30, bidding boxes will be old hat.|pg||
nt|kemperg: we had an older player missing 7NT in his box|pg||
pc|h4|nt|halila: as you see|pg||
pc|hK|nt|moonbeam42:  W hand has already said he's not interested in game, 3@s may have demanded a cue|pg||
nt|animeshraj: well if it demands... then forced 2|pg||
nt|kemperg: told him thats good for him.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ah, pass cards are issued at age 30 in Holland. Well I'm glad my Senior team will have access to them in Veldhovn|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|halila: other wise it is difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not sure it really matters|pg||
nt|pelu: they have all controls - and 6@H just need @Hs 3-2 , u can ruff a @S and disc a @C on @d|pg||
nt|galois85: on a heart guess 6@h or 6!nt thanks to the jxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|minimeck: shouldn't be too hard to defend, but no gaurantees :x|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|pelu: if u only look at NS-card then 6@H a perfect slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 5 diamonds shows 4 aces.....|pg||
nt|pelu: but 7 - just bad bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, they are supposed to bring their own|pg||

pc|s2|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Let me 'pass'|pg||
nt|kemperg: N not happy with his bid|pg||

pc|s4|nt|galois85: well but failla supposed his partner to have also the @hk|pg||

pc|h7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|galois85: 1-4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|nt|rensph: well neither opponent actually promised any real values|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c9|nt|animeshraj: but if its optional... then he should just bid 4H. its an effective 8hcp opener.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|moonbeam42:  Obviously E didn't take him for much since he passed 4@h|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|d3|nt|gsper:  Could 2@S have been psychic or something?|pg||

nt|henryb:  Looking at the scores I am going to guess that it will take about 164 or so to reach the quarters|pg||
pc|cK|nt|minimeck: according to rodwell, 1nt on those hands is by faaar a % winner, but don't ask me to explain the science :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|minimeck: you'd have to look in his secret files to which i don't have access|pg||
nt|athene: the trend at the top level is to open 1nt more and more on the "middling strength" 5422 and even 5431 hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the end, a flat board to finish us out|pg||
nt|athene: because it simplifies things|pg||
nt|minimeck: specifically also with stiff k|pg||
nt|athene: lots of ways you run into trouble opening, for example, 4-5-2-2 15 count with 1@H|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
