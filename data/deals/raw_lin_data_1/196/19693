mb|p|mb|1C|nt|vugraphzmw: ONE MINOR OR BOTH MAJORS|pg||
nt|guillemin: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all |pg||
mb|1S|nt|gulyas: NED RUM took a sizeable lead after being 16 down in the first set|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzmw: rdl points|pg||
nt|minimeck: a normal modern 1nt here, xx by wackwitz values here|pg||
nt|gulyas: this the 2nd of 3 sets|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|gulyas: again, 1@D is walsh, meaning he has no major unless 10+|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: dbl to|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: take out|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome back everyone :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|minimeck: good morning also to Giulio @h, has done a great job so far!, we are in very good hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Still one minute to go to midday in London |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rensph: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: ARG URU managed to pull 7 imps back in the last segment, still a very close match here |pg||
nt|minimeck: hello Rens|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|minimeck: Rodrigo will need to lead diamonds to set 3nt here, should be no problem holding the ace of clubs |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  this 3N will go down quickly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW have bought it. Looks like spades plays quite well for NS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|minimeck: he will know with 100% certainty that NS have a long club suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would have liked that 1@H being played out...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so NS have been caught on the hop, so to speak|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|minimeck: knowing they do not have a heart fit and his partner has the long spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: normal 1nt by north here, double is purely takeout :) if he had the guts, could have got 300 in 1h |pg||
nt|gulyas: he would have deserved that for overcalling with that junk|pg||
nt|mdgraham: welcome back|pg||
pc|c4|nt|minimeck: East decides to make a game try here, a foul lie here even 2@h might go down|pg||
nt|minimeck: same contract other room|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: this will be off a few fifties, but the lie of the cards means NS make 4@s  |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rensph: I'd seriously consider opening 1NT as E here|pg||
nt|rensph: this is a pretty bad hand for it but usually it works out with 15-17 bal|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gulyas: or 500 maybe|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|minimeck: i disagree there, a 100% overcall, |pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, alot of players have shifted to the philosophy of opening all 5-3-3-2 distributions in the point range 1nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction pretty normal for 15-17 or 14-16 NT openers|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|minimeck: I believe rodwell when he says its by far the winning % bid |pg||
pc|c3|pc|d3|nt|minimeck: but a flat board will be the outcome :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: I would never ever overcall with that, only gets you into trouble, either directly or indirectly (by revealing where the points/distribution is)|pg||
nt|gulyas: a pile of jacks, wk suit (come on, opps take 3! tricks in that suit against you in NT)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: in junior bridge is mandatory|pg||
nt|gulyas: I know that juniors like to bid:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: that still makes it a bad call|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|minimeck: Good morning everyone :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: you wouldn't be too surprised to see 990 in 4@sx+1 next door - but we shall see. It's a bit early for predictions |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the second set was a bit of a disaste for the ARG/URU team. Let us hope that they can make a comeback|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|minimeck: Argentina have shown they do not open 1nt very, often however, 3 or 4 hands where they didn't open 1nt even with 4M and 5 M -2-2|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5 (card minor)|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be a push here to start things out|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  hi Matt|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|nt|gulyas: we used to preempt like crazy when we were juniors - we were always happy when we did not get x-ed:) its was the 'oops, they did not take their 1100 again' feeling:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome back everyone, the third of fourth segments, here, will need to chop about half of the lead here to half a serious chance|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: Hi all - hard job for the south-american team|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s3|pc|h8|pc|d2|pg||

nt|warrens:  misfit hand, N/S need to stay low.  should be able to make at least 3 @C's, but hard to get there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Views?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree Roland, though at favorable I would reconsider|pg||
mb|1N|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|warrens:  best bid now is actually pass, though 2@H seems likely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Horror auction for North|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  oh no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is not exactly a dream spot|pg||
nt|guillemin: and vulnerable|pg||
pc|c5|nt|warrens:  same start at the other table, but S rebid his @D's. |pg||
nt|brgpro: but the auction looks reasonable|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|warrens:  he can take 2 @c's, 2 @s's, and 2 or 3 @H's.  needs to get a @D trick to make this|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|c2|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|c8|pc|s6|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|cJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|warrens:  he had to cash another @S, ruff a @S with the @H 7 or 9, then go back to dummy with the @C Ace to ruff again|pg||
nt|warrens:  but then he'd be stuck in his hand with QJ4 of @H's and still -1|pg||

nt|minimeck: a flat 3nt here|pg||
nt|minimeck: a perfectly fitting hand but north just doesn't have enough to really bidnorth doesn't have alot of high cards but a nice shapely hand, could have taken a bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: sorry* part of that was for a private chat :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, you can understand why North was willing to defend, what with five trumps and being vulnerable and all that  |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: good slam bid and made by ARG in the OR|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|minimeck: spectator proposes east could have doubled 3nt, almost being sure that he will have five tricks, seems he was content with a plus score here |pg||
nt|minimeck: NS can also make 4@c |pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see how the Dutch handle it here|pg||
nt|rensph: It can be difficult to stay calm and focused when you know you're behind 20-30 imps, but usually there's no reason to force any swings if you manage to bid and make your game ...|pg||
nt|rensph: contracts.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|minimeck: indeed, more of a chance over 2@h as at the other table perhaps, but a similar judgement|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: strange x with 5c@H suit, but at least he can offer all other suits as well, not as bad as it looks|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S bids 3@S now, they will end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi 2@d and leaping michaels by N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but singleton @dA and four-card spades...well, I don't know. Easy to say he should bid when you can see all the hand |pg||
nt|minimeck: multi 2@d here by west, a very :) hop thinks he knows which suit... but :p|pg||
nt|minimeck: a very interesting situation this is*|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South checking that everybody is playing with the blue cards|pg||
mb|2D|nt|minimeck: Rodrigo(da rosa) personally said he was pretty exhausted by the matches thus far, but i'm sure they slept very soundly, should be fresh today, can make 4 here but not 5 with the ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: diamond ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: first blood to the south americans here, some neat tools here for Ned, does anyone know what 1nt is here?|pg||
nt|minimeck: north might just give up and go with 3nt here, but will be worried about slam |pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't see the point in West doubling |pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzmw: 1 nt = 5+ clubs and 4th ajor|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: major|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: thank you, Raptor 1nt , :) interesting choice with 7-4|pg||
nt|Walddk5:  for those who want to watch more than one room:  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile|pg||
nt|minimeck: I cannot imagine Wackwitz will sit for this, but he will have a tough time catching up here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Daniel Gulyas|pg||
nt|gulyas: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|minimeck: good morning Daniel :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, not multi|pg||
nt|minimeck: a normal 2@h by south here over the F(sf) 1nt and now south in a pickle :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|minimeck: I agree completely, 3@h by south is natural, x just helps opps sort things out|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: I'm not sure but pass shows spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: this certainly sounds like a pen dbl, but S has no trumps to lead, and has a 7carder in @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: in any case, if rodrigo's auto-6@s on the previous set was a predictor, a good save available |pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: this will be beaten 1 or 2 tricks, but NS has game|pg||
nt|minimeck: Clearly he was not happy with this quandary, but he had no clear way forward|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3NT and 5@C both makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: hm, N did not think his black holdings are enough for slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead will set...@h lead will require E to guess to play A@d|pg||
nt|minimeck: but a practical option just rebid the d|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  and this will hand contract to NS|pg||
pc|d5|nt|minimeck: decides to take the plus, a very good start for ARG URU as NS have arrived in 3nt|pg||
nt|minimeck: might be able to get out for 100 here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|minimeck: very simmilar in many sports such as soccer, even a goal down in the second half, you don't sell out and send everyone forward until about 20 or so minutes left, if you give ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: anything more up, you're dead, :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: can score 5s, 3h, 2d and a club here|pg||
nt|minimeck: but might duck a diamond|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|gulyas: and his red holdings looked to be dubious opposite at least one short red suit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|minimeck: that is possible that they have some sort of agreement along those lines, but i don't think x should be manditory to clarify |pg||
nt|pelu: first 10 IMPs for ARG-URU - 4@H -1 in board 1|pg||
nt|minimeck: and sure enough before everyone comfortably in their seats, :) a nice pickup|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|gulyas: maybe, will have a hard time dealing with the 4 trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has to get @Ds right (which should not be too difficult|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gulyas: wrong ace led, so 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: but 12 imp back to the trailing ARG URU|pg||
pc|cA|nt|minimeck: with 7/4 might have been better here for Wackwitz to simply overcall 2@c, the raptor nt overcall created more of a problem for NS than EW|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|minimeck: that hand is a good demonstration of the necesity to raise partner (especially NV) whenever possible, it was enough to discourage east from notrump|pg||

nt|Walddk2: An opportunity for ARG URU|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, a chance for N/S, since 5@H doesn't make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Therewe go again, 5 over 5, it is usually wrong|pg||

nt|gulyas: cutting the deficit to 20|pg||
nt|minimeck: fans rooting for action, the last set usually full of fireworks, we will have to wait a bit :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: very agressive lead by Maxi, perhaps looking to find pard with Ax|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, maybe, but when the opposition have taken over the auction there is no reason why you be compelled to reveal your hand type |pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: I agree|pg||
nt|minimeck: one of the distinct advantages of multi is the fact that in these situations it greats alot of pressure in the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|gulyas: a partscore battle here, NS can make abt 2-3@Cs, EW is good until abt 3@S|pg||
nt|minimeck: especially with two attractive alternatives, somewhat suprising, chance for a swing|pg||
nt|andyv:  on prior hand, as spec pointed out, I meant to say muidberg convention...used in conjunction with the multi...we'll see if that is what EW play|pg||
nt|minimeck: an action board here :) a good save for NS |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|minimeck: in theory, it has alot of losers and work to do in practice |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|minimeck: double or 1@h both options here on the east hand, with the quality of the heart suit and poor spades, chooses 1@h here|pg||
nt|rensph: looks like a matter of overtricks in 4@H here|pg||
nt|minimeck: they are having an adventure at the other table, might land in 6@d|pg||
nt|minimeck: (also with a multi opening)|pg||
nt|pelu: strange decision by S in OR in B2 - he passed to 2@H??|pg||
nt|minimeck: ouch|pg||
mb|4S|nt|MolvaM: hi all pictures from Opatija http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143 !/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: but the 1@H overcall (which is normal) leaves no way to find @Ss on a safe level|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless it goes 1NT-p-2@C now|pg||
nt|gulyas: then he can dbl for t/o|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: note wackwitz only bids 1nt, Bob is extremely well known for some light bids, and he is 3rd seat favorable :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good slam here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: west will be declarer, then|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|gulyas: he has 7 tricks from top, maybe able to get another trick by an endplay|pg||
nt|rensph: 2NT forcing a 3@C bid from partner, after which S will show a GF 5-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: looks like Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|minimeck: i think Maxi's confidence has been shatered, after going down in a cold 3nt by forgetting that his spade was good in the last set, may still be in shock|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mdgraham: One of the better modern treatments|pg||
nt|guillemin: maybe 6@D can be a good contract, but @S lead could make things go wrong|pg||
nt|minimeck: and a disaster for Ferro Scanavino, have bid 7@d off a cashing ace|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not advisable|pg||
nt|minimeck: wow, helmich should have let the five level belong to the opponents here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: will likely lead the A@d |pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 4 clubs support hearts|pg||
nt|minimeck: seeing dummy should cashout, we shall see :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: ferro will be happy to collect now|pg||
nt|pelu: dont save 2x - here Scanavino didnt stand his partners X, but saved by N|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  2@c should set up a game force and NS have plenty of room to explore for slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: yesterday we saw ARG URU benefit from a NED slam bid off two cashing aces, RKC is a very handy tool when used properly :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: No 3@H from North. South might be wary of 3NT now, with singleton @HA|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: could well be on their way to 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: strip endplay also available in 3@c , and scanavino has found it, will be a push or an imp|pg||
nt|minimeck: exactly :) plenty of room to cue bid here, i predict they will get there no problem|pg||
nt|minimeck: i predict they will stop in 5, |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, if you've doubled 4@s, you might as well doublw 5@s |pg||
nt|minimeck: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rensph: 4@C not necessarily showing a club cue, just setting trumps and giving partner the room to bid 4@D, which doesn't promise a cue either but a good hand for the bidding so far|pg||
nt|pelu: with 3 Aces strange that N bid on - did he hope to make 5@s?|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5 spades is shooting for a very narrow window, looking at three aces|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|minimeck: I can't imagine him thinking 5 s is making|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe North read more into South's 4@s than South intended|pg||
nt|pelu: S know the !Â§S-situation - but no entry to his hand|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|gulyas: has to get this right for the overtrick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we are both wrong :(|pg||
nt|guillemin: we where all wrong :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: helmich decides to offer 4@s instead and hop accepts the offer|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Argentinian even|pg||

nt|Walddk2: True, he could not know his partner's spades were that good|pg||
nt|brgpro: little bit less than 50%|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|warrens:  not a slam I'd like to be in.  sometimes trumps don't break so well.|pg||

nt|minimeck: and back to even for this set :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: sry, ace first|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gulyas: yes, most likely they will play 2NT (or maybe 3:))|pg||

mb|1H|nt|gulyas: yuck, what an ugly 8 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: can make a few spades or hearts here|pg||
nt|rensph: 2@C from S now, showing majors?|pg||
nt|minimeck: a 1nt opener for my taste here on east, i predict 1@s from GdR, they have not opened many offshape 1nts|pg||
nt|minimeck: this tournament|pg||
mb|1S|nt|minimeck: that is a common and very usefull treatment|pg||
nt|pelu: but the dutch team just look forward to a lot of flat boards :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gulyas: on a @D lead, even 2NT can be beaten|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|minimeck: no other way to bid these hands over 1nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW make quite a few clubs here|pg||
mb|d!|nt|gulyas: is this a 14-16NT?|pg||
nt|minimeck: :) perhaps they play 14-16?|pg||
nt|gulyas: beat ya:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: only one top loser here for EW in clubs :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5c would be interesting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and given the state of the match, you kind of suspect they will bid five|pg||
nt|minimeck: scanavino should just blast|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  the @s suit is pretty top heavy for a lot to open 1NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: on a spade lead i don't think he will have much difficulty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a bit wimpy, with the useful @DK |pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
nt|pelu: he now risk all pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|play4fun55:  should be possible for N/S to get their h ruff for one down|pg||
nt|pelu: not Feero :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|minimeck: the majors of course good to have partnership agreements on expected length, well sorted out here|pg||
nt|minimeck: he didn't come all this way to play 4@c down 50+ imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: hop should find a raise here i would think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has shown a very good hand.|pg||
nt|minimeck: if pard has "anything" useful he expects a raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't think we will see many part-scores |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|minimeck: spades are flopping, and trumps 3-3, maybe a 5th for defense in the wash|pg||
nt|minimeck: somewhat normal to double them here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gulyas: they can take 3@Ds, 2@Cs and a @H|pg||
nt|minimeck: Maxi crusizio out for blood meanwhile in the open room, will collect very nicely and a big swing to uruguay argentina|pg||
nt|mdgraham: question is whether South regards Jxx spades and a doubleton heart as worth a raise|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: to keep it to just making|pg||
nt|minimeck: allready two boards where the argentines have opened the "old school" 1m and 1M while bob elects 1nt, has worked out well so far for them|pg||
nt|minimeck: it's somewhat of a two-sided coin, he has those two features, but it's still a flat 3 count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sure|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can make twelve, but may be afraid of 3-1 trumps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|pelu: B3: 4@S X - letv see if EW can defat that 2x|pg||

nt|minimeck: Crusizio and Garcia Da Rosa meanwhile are much more "meckwellian" in there approach, i think they have chosen well to play this pair|pg||
nt|minimeck: on many hands like this as well, makes it alot tougher on opps to get in on the partscore battle|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even so, it is a balanced 3-count, and @DQ is probably wasted|pg||
nt|minimeck: either of you tempted to put le-blu on that after only bidding 4c w/ east?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|play4fun55:  4 h is a likely contract|pg||
nt|minimeck: another action hand here, NS can make 5@d, after a likely 1nt opener will they find it|pg||
nt|minimeck: north would balance over a 2@h contract here, however, should be normal|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, W was pretty conservative on last hand...could have at least shown some values by bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, perhaps two takeout doubles and 2s would suggest more majorish with longer spades than a bigger hand|pg||
nt|guillemin: interesting 7NT|pg||
nt|pelu: ok 3NT - best played by N - 10 tricks|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rensph: X shows 5m 4M|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: and another telephone number for Agica Nistor in the other room! now in 2@h x|pg||

nt|guillemin: @C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|minimeck: although perhaps i spoke too soon :), yet again a non-1nt opener|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed guille, grandma and grandpa might ask for aces and ask for kings and say, good enough for me|pg||
nt|guillemin: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  game in @hs coming up|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gulyas: this time a 25-point 3NT is a maker|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|gulyas: W trying for game now, seeing the big fit|pg||
nt|minimeck: we will see if helmich applies any more science than that|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: same spot here, should be 800 here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@c-1@d-2NT-4NT may be quantitative|pg||
nt|guillemin: 5@D in board NÂ°17 at other table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in which case you need a conventional method of applying Blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E should bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: very strange bidding here, :) i imagine now maxi will bid 3nt shoulder shruggingly|pg||
nt|gulyas: showing his pattern to give pd the chance to look out for the red suits|pg||
nt|minimeck: might be able to establish a long club|pg||
nt|minimeck: that lead helps certainly|pg||
nt|minimeck: in practice 800 not realistic, :x defense has to give something up|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: a flat board to give everyone a chance to grab their coffee and donuts :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S wants a refund on his lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: really his only option on lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: but will make it pretty easy for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|andyv:  this board would be more interesting in a BAM event where finessing for the @S would be very tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: NEXT THE LEAD RODRIGO CLOSED THE SCREEN AND ASK SOMETH TO NORTH|pg||
nt|minimeck: looks like he wants to look for slam in one of the minors here|pg||
nt|minimeck: a preference back to 4d here from hop i suppose|pg||
nt|pelu: No RD - I am not sure that we can get 800 out of 5@Sx|pg||
nt|minimeck: a good point :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzmw: garica didn't alerted 3 spades wathever it means|pg||
nt|rensph: Other room played by W, leading a small diamond|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting murky|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be quick here on the club lead, 5 back to uru as east did not continue diamonds after 10@d switch|pg||
pc|c2|nt|minimeck: getting too fancy here,|pg||
pc|c9|nt|minimeck: might have needed to duck there for tempo|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|minimeck: the important thing to note here, when you decide not to open 1nt it is impossible to show "15-17" balanced :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: really, both should have bid 3NT at some point:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: still strange for him not to bid 3nt over 2@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless 4@c was Gerber|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, they likely have this sorted out|pg||
nt|minimeck: operator will let us know if convenient|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 IMP to ARG B4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: If I'm doubled in something that I think has a chance of making - I'm happy |pg||
pc|h5|nt|gulyas: once again the suits are not too friendly|pg||
nt|minimeck: but south endplayed now|pg||
nt|minimeck: must find a diamond shift to get the spade through|pg||
nt|rensph: @DA @DJ now?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzmw: 4nt seems to be kcb|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry B3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no need to paint the roses|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|rensph: Had north held any spade values he would've played his small clubs the other way around|pg||
nt|minimeck: south in the same pickle as before, he should have seen this coming and possibly shifted to a diamond earlier, |pg||
nt|minimeck: he still has to guess, however|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gulyas: the lead blows a trick for the defense, but its only an overtrick|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  a ruffing finessin clubs  against west should see south home though|pg||
nt|gulyas: taking the ruffing finesse in @Cs works, as the 9 is dropping|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|minimeck: a white game for the NED rum and a likely 7 imps|pg||
nt|twcho: can either side count 13 tricks?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|minimeck: will be 11 tricks |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: losing a @D and a @S, making 5, and losing 6imps in the process|pg||
pc|d6|nt|play4fun55:  no other sensible line for South to follow either|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  would have been better to winn the last h in hand and take the ruffing finess directly, now South might be in trouble|pg||
nt|minimeck: does appear they went through their king asking sequence and just bit 7|pg||
nt|twcho: well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this would have been far easier if North had taken charge - three aces and two kings and he can count 13, just about (assuming South has four spades)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, they got there. Well done|pg||
pc|d8|nt|minimeck: correct, 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|minimeck: no reason to hook the spade :)|pg||
nt|guillemin: 4@S in board NÂ°18|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gulyas: so NED RUM on the board now|pg||
nt|minimeck: and a much needed 10 back for arg uru|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: I ask|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 4 clubs is clubs, 4 nt is sign off|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: and then north take the command|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzmw: south calls td|pg||
nt|gulyas: I imagine some rapid Spanish under the screen now:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: can't imagine what for, a good board for him|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: complain for spade lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am sure if he knew they were 4-3 in @Ss, he would have led sg else|pg||
nt|minimeck: so perhaps the overtrick at issue|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, and it also counts as an IMP, 270=7|pg||
nt|minimeck: Rodrigo and maxi are pretty calm, they aren't like the famous italians :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: to garcia 3 spade was almost natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: he supported|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, I like to steal some phrases from the late mr Anderson:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: td change the score, just made|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|minimeck: indeed, best to save xx for the real situation when opps have made a mistake and have nowhere to go|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gulyas: of course he doesn't know that all his @Cs are high|pg||
nt|minimeck: North will be forced to give up a trump trick here|pg||
nt|minimeck: will only get two more|pg||
nt|minimeck: a fine defense compounded by poor declarer play in the open room and the likely unlikely 800 is achieved by Da rosa :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: ok, maxi took 3@s as something artificial, so wackwitz entitled to the trick as a result of the false alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but it was a very light alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: not a big one|pg||
nt|gulyas: is there such a thing?:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: is a tough lead problem, however|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like small club lead is a winner :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: that would be quite impressive indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: , ok 3@H:):)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: I only alerted a little, don't take it to heart:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: when they think some questions should be asked they strong alert|pg||
nt|gulyas: pass? are you sure?|pg||
nt|minimeck: not possible|pg||
nt|gulyas: back to WW, this time trying his hand at 1NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: going for the pre-empt option, at favorable some definite merit there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a bad dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|minimeck: Ned Juniors will not allow you to escape unscathed for naping like that|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, it is bridge, the cards don't weigh that much and they have youth on their side...only the late night partying should be a factor:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|minimeck: too much work for Rodrigo, wackwitz amazingly does not raise here|pg||
nt|minimeck: will win a swing back for NED|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south seems to have downgraded his @dQ|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|gulyas: W hoping that his pd will return his suit so he can run it... not to be, tho|pg||
nt|pelu: also 5@C in OR|pg||
nt|minimeck: with limited entries he might just cash ace of h first here and make 10|pg||
pc|s7|nt|minimeck: 2nt a 4 card heart raise|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzmw: sry...|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, better now - 2nt had to be a @H raise|pg||
nt|rensph: Still, I'd be tempted to raise.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gulyas: ok, so @D lead and a push|pg||
nt|minimeck: 10 top tricks here, 3 losers|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  a h return would make it harder for South. Now he should be able to set up and access the clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|minimeck: a very common treatment to play 2nt in these situations as such, what some people may normally play over a double|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless systemic, N has chosed an unsual way to bid this hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzmw: sry, maybe I miss an alert|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzmw: 3 club was alerted|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|minimeck: raise seems normalish* but decided to take a position 4333 and as you say qd doesn't look apetizing|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|minimeck: kindof normal to misguess trumps|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree in principle, there is a huge diference between "physical" stamina, and mental stamina, |pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Giulio|pg||
nt|twcho: this is the safety play|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|minimeck: or not :) on some layouts the club finese could risk the contract|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|minimeck: should be able to make this, and I can't imagine he would be tempted to finese west for qxx in hearts.|pg||
nt|twcho: to cater for @hK singleton offside|pg||
nt|minimeck: for those interested in the bronze medal playoff, NED RUM got out to a 34-0 lead, France stormed back and are now trailing 49-50|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|play4fun55:  Either South knows something I dont know, but I would have started playing on clubs?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: doesnt worry too much about the trumps at this contract|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at 4@s though, the lead might give declarer a clue|pg||
pc|c3|nt|minimeck: alejandro dutifully underleads his club now looking at dummy :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: I may be old fashioned, but I play a cue as inv+ with support, and 2nt is natural (but I agree you don't often want to bid a natural 2nt)|pg||
nt|minimeck: but wont have any guess in that regard :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  one way to solve it|pg||
nt|minimeck: exactly, odds play to hold the suit to 1 loser|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|minimeck: so just made|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  7@h a big card|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea, declarer might reason that the fact he underlead a king indicates he has a tough hand to lead from (and trump tricks)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h7|pc|s2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  nicely done|pg||

nt|gulyas: you can play 2nt as 4+ supp, while cue is only 3|pg||
nt|minimeck: (according to the scientists who created that)|pg||
nt|minimeck: some action potential here|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW can make 5@C here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Nice cards for NS so far this set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|gulyas: wild hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: over a negative x by north, will east bid 1nt :)?|pg||
nt|minimeck: or pass|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  Sorry Daniel, have to leave you to continue|pg||
nt|gulyas: np|pg||
nt|minimeck: either 3nt or 5c on here, |pg||
nt|MolvaM: both matches very close now|pg||
nt|minimeck: a nice fitting hand here|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N plays around, EW may find their red suit fits|pg||
nt|minimeck: depending on their weak 2 style, north may feel obligated to inquire|pg||
nt|minimeck: but might simply blast here, |pg||
nt|andyv:  if S has 6@s, then 4@s is obvious...no need to inquire...N hand is not that strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: hellmich has already bid 4 spade, rodrigo is thinking a lot|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may still be tempted to act over 4@s|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you giulio, makes sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: I wait tray pass on to record bids|pg||
nt|minimeck: spectators asking for the running scores can find them here, the site is back up|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gulyas: EW has a 5-3@H fit that is 5-0 against, while NS has a 6-2@C with 5-0 against...|pg||

mb|d!|nt|minimeck: it appears NS play transfers her, however|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2 d= transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|gulyas: that takes the needle out of the EW butts:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: a rdbl here would show a high honor in @S in my system, I wonder if others play this gadget too|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has possible 6 losers of which pd should be able to cover 2.5|pg||
nt|minimeck: no fear by Da Rosa :) |pg||
nt|minimeck: 4h will be close here, two clubs and a spade shift should doom it|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|gulyas: S not happy to hear that xfer|pg||
nt|minimeck: in most cases, these transfers are not "manditory" as with an NT opener, south is free to bid his hand w/o tolerance|pg||
nt|rensph: 5@C down on 3 roudns of @H?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Ned Juniors lead france by 8 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless EW go to 5@c...|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 3NT has a problem: off 5 top tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: 1Nt or 2Nt?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT will lead to 3NT, which could be a bit of a problem|pg||
nt|pelu: 25 HCP but no play for 3NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|minimeck: might escape undoubled here, interestingly enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this can go down 800|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 1100|pg||
mb|3N|nt|minimeck: you are correct, :) was not looking closely enough, 3nt the normal spot|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to blame either N or S for not doubling this "confindently" bid slam :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S has a clear dbl...at least to warn N from bidding 6@s if nothing less|pg||
nt|minimeck: they have done alot of saving so far, but both EW have allready bid their hands to the fullest|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: south would have not enjoyed 3@c at all, 3@d by maxi here an "all in" bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: is N gonna apply the axe? no|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops|pg||
nt|twcho: a good start for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: now that declarer knows @Hs are not favourable, he will play on @Ds|pg||
nt|minimeck: i think declarer will have trouble avoiding 5 losers here|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can take 4@Ds, 2@Hs and 2@Cs for 8|pg||
nt|gulyas: S must lead the @SK, else they will not be able to untangle the suit later|pg||
nt|gulyas: he did, so they may cash out now|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|minimeck: a good garbage 2@h bid will make def here easy :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: maybe he can sneak the @S9 thru first:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gulyas: really, 5 to the 9 is not a very strong stop in NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: it maybe OK in 1NT, but not in 3|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|minimeck: declarer can take them all now if he wishes, after taking 6 clubs his heart and 2 spades, can either hook the diamond |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|minimeck: or just go AK and hope for the q to drop|pg||
nt|minimeck: certainly could be right, the 4@s bid by north here is entirely nebulous, however, he could be doubling a cold slam|pg||
pc|hA|nt|minimeck: agreed, that is likely his best shot|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|minimeck: but he needs to protect his side|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  A@d and @c shift would produce down 4...with dbl, 1100|pg||
nt|minimeck: worth the risk :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|gulyas: there was really no need to jump to 3nt, he could have started with 2@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: interestingly, this is at least the 3rd (if not 4th) hand in this semis where you should play 5 of a minor instead of 3nt despite stoppers in all suits|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you call Q vs 987xx a stopper, that is...|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: well east claimed and now td is at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: one or two off|pg||
nt|gulyas: he claimed 1 off? that should be ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: cliamed made, that's the problem|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can drive out the @CA and thats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: most probably he forgot club ace|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, thats a problem:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: its an obv -1, so it should not be too hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: north says he could loose a diamond if esat has forget the ace club|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, come on|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: I agree|pg||
nt|gulyas: excuse my French, but its like stirring the sh*t:) (like fighting for partscore battles in imp scoring:) )|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: your french is perfect|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: anyway I know u, u were palying italians tournaments with Mike, isn't it?|pg||
nt|gulyas: Mike?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: michelangelo and ruggero|pg||
nt|gulyas: nope|pg||
nt|gulyas: I played a few Italian turnaments, but always with my Hungarian friends:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: another daniel from hungary maybe|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, you must mean the other Daniel, Vikor|pg||
nt|gulyas: he used to play there a lot|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: I know him too, but he wasn't, no prob|pg||
nt|gulyas: so a missed opportunity to gain 10, and lose 7 instead here|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  dbling a cold slam less risky then having pd take a phantom save|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|minimeck: very good point|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|minimeck: can put south under pressure here|pg||
nt|pelu: that discard will tell decl that @Ss 5-1 - but will it help him?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl will also wonder why N didnt setup his @Hs - a clue that N dont have @D-H?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|minimeck: WOW|pg||
nt|pelu: even if u have no entry, u often put presure on decl if u set up your suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: caught hop napping and made him pay dearly|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|minimeck: very fine play by alejandro|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South caught on the hop|pg||
nt|minimeck: he had the right general idea, knew the shape of the hand and needed a minor miracle to make it, went for that instead of diamonds both being onside |pg||
nt|minimeck: still not home and try, but with the heart stopper remaining, can now afford the diamond guess|pg||
nt|minimeck: risk free :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|minimeck: now drijver can just set up his extra heart, another possible swing to NED having stopped in 2nt in the other room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: will probably cashhis AK's|pg||

nt|minimeck: hard to blame him for that, although with east being marked AKQ of @h, certainly an option to finese :p|pg||
nt|rensph: :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: an interesting trump suit position, in theory west could have Q10 doubleton and try and drop the queen on trick one, figuring they will guess it, can't remember ever seeing that ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: executed, however |pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, he deserved a win for that play, alas likely a push :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the non-@H-lead from N sh be that clue for him|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gulyas: another 6 for NED RUM, closing the gap|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite likely 3NT here too|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: i think west should have passed 3@c there, if he more carefully considered the context clues of the auction, his p could not raise spades, nor double 2@d, and north made a transfer ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: to hearts|pg||
nt|minimeck: some tense moments so far in this match, but netherlands still sailing comfortably|pg||
mb|1N|nt|minimeck: but knowing east was entitled to three tricks anyway, he was content |pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to blame Crusizio for bidding 6, "pard can bid a vul 5@H, and i have the spade control QJx in trump and a decent minor holdings|pg||
nt|minimeck: a push on the 7nt hand, south opened 2@d (18-19 balanced) so a simple matter for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: in anycase he did have a complete count for the 12th|pg||
nt|MolvaM: last 3 cards of east were @hAKQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he could have exited with a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: just two trump losers here in 5@d|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS would make 3NT if @Cs ran|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: right, 5@D makes, just has to find it how to get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 clubs multi meanings|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt now from scanavino|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, 1NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: if i had to summarize the play in this championships I would say we have seen many moments of brilliance by the players, as well as some pretty horrifying results on the other side ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: of the coin. About what is to be expected in a junior tournament :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gulyas: they have 6-4@Ds but nobody mentioned the suit yet|pg||
nt|minimeck: wackwitz has bypassed 1@d here, he still has time for 3@d now, garcia applies max pressure|pg||
nt|minimeck: so not an option, a tough bid now|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: ok, maybe was an other name and I'm confused vith Vikor|pg||
nt|gulyas: with pretty much everything right here, every game makes|pg||
nt|minimeck: alot of credit deserved for Scanavino & Ferro of argentina, this whole championships their slam bidding has been phenomenal|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: he plays with Pauncz occasionally|pg||
nt|gulyas: or anybody else that pays him:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: ten yaers I direct in Venice tournament|pg||
nt|mdgraham: having bid 2@h, odds are that South would play for a singleton whether West played the 10 or the Q, but it would be a good false card from Q10   |pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzmw: one heart alerted|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|minimeck: 9 of diamonds lead?|pg||
nt|minimeck: two more for Uruguay as Rodrigo had his radar on in 3nt on the low heart lead, well done |pg||
nt|minimeck: 2nt here 4 card limit(ish) +|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzmw: so I know many interantional players|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, Venice, the Venice of...um, Italy?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: y|pg||
nt|minimeck: wackwitz has a toughish lead here, spade might be right if they only have two stoppers|pg||
nt|minimeck: but goes with the passive diamond :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north's pass of 2@s probably showed no high honors|pg||
nt|minimeck: a common treatment these days|pg||
pc|c3|nt|minimeck: this contract will not fetch, perhaps unlucky on the club split, but 5@d superior, another win for old school bidding, Ferro has arrived in 5d|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 3NT it is, and with the @C suit not breaking, it only has 8 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|minimeck: 3@h no game interest opposite any limit|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and east was probably looking very confident of himself at the table :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: things very friendly here, clubs split, ace of hearts doubleton|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: spec suggests 2@D by N, but you really need more for that|pg||
nt|gulyas: just kidding|pg||
pc|c9|nt|minimeck: will want to keep south on lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: overtaking @cQ loses a trick|pg||
nt|minimeck: should tuck here|pg||
nt|minimeck: duck*|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so north is helploess here|pg||
nt|minimeck: if north has KQ7x there is a second loser anyway|pg||
pc|c7|nt|minimeck: the dutch version incorporates some other options i am told|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|minimeck: south has been extremely thoughtful this set, not suprising after a few blunders in the previous.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d2|pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: some use 3@c and 3@d as 8-9 and 10-11 with four trumps |pg||

pc|s8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he decided to take the radical approach|pg||
nt|minimeck: ferro could have solved the problem by upgrading to 1nt, with two 10's, close enough|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|minimeck: with such a distributional hand, 6-4, not one to typically "bypass" the diamonds, but i do have some empathy|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||

nt|henryb:  It leads partner to distrust your overcalls' offensive potential|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|henryb:  It does not interfere with the opponents' auction|pg||
nt|warrens:  Agreed.  there has to be a reason to overcall 1@D, either a good hand (opening values +) or a really good suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|warrens:  and he's at unfavorable too|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  And while it may suggest a lead, your holdings in the majors are such that you really do not mind a lead in either one|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would call the 1@d overcall...too busy|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is going to be a tough hand to develop 8 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  A kibitzer asks why a 4-card suit overcall. Shouldn't you have at least 5|pg||
nt|brgpro: it takes a strong nerve to pass with the E cards|pg||
nt|henryb:  Several answers possible: he ran out of green (pass) cards :) He likes the color orange since he is Dutch :) He is young and thinks he has only so many passes for his life, and does not want to use them up on this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|minimeck: extremely bizare if that's how the play went|pg||
nt|gulyas: 11? wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: crusizio disarded a diamond|pg||
nt|gulyas: was he patting his own back, too?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: a big swing there|pg||
nt|gulyas: do that for us then|pg||
mb|1C|nt|minimeck: he wasn't even pressured on the discards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice @h distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I mean, pat his back:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Nasty problem for South, now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|minimeck: halfway done and 10 imps between the teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: another 3nt here for NS|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west is lucky that he is not the dealer here|pg||
nt|minimeck: for some reason people seem to love to argue about flannery more than any other convention, not my preference but i don't have a problem with it :p|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|minimeck: on a diamond lead will be a bit interesting|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a weak 2@h opening could go for a number|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gulyas: Lebensohl in action here|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to make a prediction here, seems he has to rebid hearts, 3 or 4 was the question|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: hard to blame him|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: specs say with the walsh convention you have to start with 1@H response on the S hand, but I disagree|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree Daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: walsh states you have to have GF with 44, and inv+ with 54|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the S hand qualifies for a 1@D easily|pg||
nt|gulyas: Leb-slow as opposed to Leb-fast in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: later I'll do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: EW will have to keep there composure here, after giving away two game swings|pg||
nt|gulyas: in the OR they did start with 1@C-1@D-2@D, and they were never in doubt abt the right contract|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS got lucky with the bad discard|pg||
nt|minimeck: they right sided the contract here :) |pg||
nt|pelu: 1Nt and not 2@Cs for me|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: ty:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: td comes back with 3nt one off|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: good call|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2@d and 3@c here show?|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt might have had a chance here, 4@h will not succeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  too many good pairs play it (Levin-Weinstein come to mind) so it can't be ignored.|pg||
nt|andyv:  does N have a bid over 2N?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: We have had this argument before - what to rebid on the South hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gulyas: so instead of 10 out, its 2 in for NED RUM, down by 1 only|pg||
nt|minimeck: kib points out 9 top tricks even on a diamond lead from east, don't need clubs :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2d looked for a 3-card @h support probably?|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3@s 3@c 2@d 1@h|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree, oftentimes with conventions like that, it's less often a case of one being vastly inferior or superior, rather it being a part of "filling out the system" of each pair|pg||
nt|minimeck: i might pass 2nt white, but he had some fillers|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|minimeck: decided to go for it, if i were to bid, however, i would never bid 3s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  it's close...I imagine a lot of players would have bid 4@h with the S hand immediately anyway|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|minimeck: depends on what kind of mood i'm in :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|gulyas: can he scramble an overtrick? either @Hs, or @S offer a chance to take one more|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, the opps have @HAK and @DA, so only of he sneaks a @H thru can he make 10|pg||
nt|gulyas: but this is no pairs tournament|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs 9, so he will play for 9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the one hand, South is balanced, which would indicate bidding notrumps; on the other, North may have sapdes|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|gulyas: another 3NT not making, while 5@D would have...|pg||
nt|minimeck: for those interested, NED juniors up early against france, very possible we might see an all NED finals (+ 1 US / 1 Romanian) , that would be exciting|pg||
nt|gulyas: and when S gets in with his @HAK, he will have the 4th@C to cash to keep it at 9|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|minimeck: Nistor raised to all of 2@d on his 16 count with 5 card support, so they have landed in only 2 in the other room|pg||
pc|c5|nt|twcho: why is the 1@s response being highlighted?|pg||
nt|pelu: and u arealways in good mood :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  this will not be pretty|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|minimeck: unsure of their methods, do they invert their 1s and 1nt?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|minimeck: and we will have a new leader|pg||
nt|gulyas: if N had held all the @S cards (QJ98), he would be squeezed now|pg||
nt|minimeck: at favorable the expectation is north will respond on zero basically and a major, hop giving his p some margin |pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: however, opening clubs and then bidding spades implies two suits for some of us |pg||
pc|c7|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|gulyas: S has to cling on to his 9xx of S|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|minimeck: that is confirmed, so 0-4 spades it appears|pg||

nt|gulyas: so after being 0-16 down, NED RUM took the lead 21-16|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats even faster:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: if it wasn't for the @D ruff, 4@S would make|pg||
nt|minimeck: a possible swing board here, a thin 3nt is ice cold on this layout |pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind the 2N bid..right on values and the @h spots make a @h contract a little less attractive|pg||
nt|minimeck: alot of swings out there to be won for those willing to follow hamman's rule|pg||
nt|minimeck: very likely might be a push on the previous|pg||
nt|andyv:  I tell my partners to ignore that rule and make sure they have the cards that I need|pg||
nt|minimeck: Lankveld in a nasty 4sx on the hand where 4h was set 1, the match will tighten up significantly|pg||
nt|twcho: another possible slam on a finesse|pg||
nt|minimeck: with the 4333 and kxxx in spades i might also bid 1nt|pg||
nt|pelu: few values but 4@H on by EW|pg||
nt|minimeck: another 1nt for me with the east hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: it will be suprising if alejandro does, have not seen them do it once so far|pg||
nt|pelu: I hate to open 1Nt with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: personal style  |pg||
nt|minimeck: i trust uncle eric rodwell when he tells me it's by far % :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: but agree, so long as ur on the same page with partner|pg||
nt|minimeck: either is fine|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@S - but 4@H and only a NT-opening can do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: little break is over now|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: play start again|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|minimeck: has been a very apparent stylistic difference between the two teams here, good for the spectators to see :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec tells me that 2N was mandatory as 4@h bid would show weak hand with a lot of distribution.|pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: 3NT makes tho:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: could also possibly make 4@h here, :) will be interesting to see|pg||
nt|minimeck: normal 3 seat opener, will be a tough ask for ns to bid slam here, might end up in 3nt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|minimeck: once again the 4 card raise w/ 2nt|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be a flat board here in 4s|pg||
nt|rensph: in the other match this board was a push in 3NT +3|pg||
nt|minimeck: xx here by east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: for those who have not heard it, Bob Hamman is known for saying "when 3nt is an attractive option, choose it"|pg||
nt|minimeck: more of a general guideline than a rule|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: what does north bid here at this point|pg||
nt|rensph: 2NT?|pg||
nt|minimeck: and AR URU are on there way to game|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2nt a possibility, nothing perfect he has a decent overcall but nothing that extra|pg||
nt|minimeck: he knows they don't have the HCP for game|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2@h here both majors?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was thinking of the other Hamman rule....don't ever play me to have a specific card or holding, I never will and you will always be disappointed.|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes... :) another good one|pg||
nt|twcho: 3N will go down|pg||
nt|twcho: while 5C is cold|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H probably a decent raise to 2@S - if so, you can imagine what a 2@s bid would be like|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: now will it go 3@S-4@S or 3NT-pass?|pg||
nt|gulyas: or maybe 3@S pass?:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: its hard to imagine a worse 11 count now|pg||
nt|gulyas: balanced, with Jxx in opp's suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: if this 3@S is not forcing, I want to pass:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|minimeck: a very sensible pass|pg||
nt|rensph: the double diamond stopper might be enough to set up partner's clubs though|pg||
nt|minimeck: and AR URU have bid 4@h !!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|minimeck: a good save available in 5@d, only 500|pg||
nt|gulyas: if it goes @D, @D ruff, would't you underlead your @CAKQ to try to get another ruff?:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5@c|pg||
nt|minimeck: we will see if they do make it|pg||
nt|minimeck: another flattish board here, this will play nicely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hearts got lost|pg||
pc|hA|nt|minimeck: on a spade lead should be a simple matter discovering the position immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, EW do look like they play the polish weak two bids|pg||
nt|minimeck: will need to shift to a diamond to set 3nt, he can duck the spade twice to kill the entry|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|gulyas: so I expect an overtrick:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this will be a defence tester - will make on @dQ lead. If a spade, defence can take two spades but must then switch to diamonds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|minimeck: I would imagine so :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess he did not want to look too stupid by missing a vul game, so he bid one more for the road |pg||
nt|gulyas: so, is this forcing for everyone? acolers?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: my impression is that he did it so|pg||
nt|rensph: given the spade layout you'll probably end up making 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|gulyas: if 3@D can be this weak, then 3@S should be passable|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to see how he could go wrong|pg||
pc|d2|nt|minimeck: another swing coming to Ned as they have found the save|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to blame ferro for just raising, seems normal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sure|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: obv E trying to tell his pd that he does not have a @C honor, but a J could suffice...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  nice play to keep S from lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|minimeck: making some number of overtricks here, could be a tie match after this board!!!|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gulyas: its not only Garcia who is tired, but also WW|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gulyas: there you go|pg||
nt|minimeck: this will be a critical board here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|minimeck: good play by maxi, worth the risk of an overtrick|pg||
nt|gulyas: I underlead my AKQJxxxx in vu once - but I was lucky, pd had the 10:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|twcho: east didn't pause to think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|minimeck: rodrigo tried with the 10@s but maxi wasn't willing to listen|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, was good @s10|pg||
nt|minimeck: a great point tommy, this is the finals of a world championship, to play spades without even giving it a moments thought|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|2H|nt|gulyas: (beat Lauria-Versace 800 with that, but who remembers that:) )|pg||
nt|minimeck: credit the southamericans perserverance, they hung with it even after a 48-0(ish) stretch in the first quarter|pg||
nt|rensph: they'll be leading by 1 imp after this board|pg||
nt|minimeck: and another action hand, a near 2 loser hand in south, but off two aces, should be able to stop after some RKC|pg||
mb|p!|nt|minimeck: :) at least one person does|pg||
nt|gulyas: yep:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  oh well|pg||
nt|minimeck: helmich has to double check his eye-sight here|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: can make 4@h here by guessing the diamonds|pg||

nt|twcho: certainly|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|minimeck: and da rosa has had enough flat boards, he's willing to risk 550 looking at AKAK|pg||

mb|p|nt|minimeck: he will have to find the jack|pg||
nt|pelu: @s lead will defeat 4@s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|gulyas: not a good fit this time, with AKQ opposite singleton|pg||
nt|gulyas: so game is out of the Q, can he get 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|gulyas: if they duck this, he can win, discard 2 @Cs on the @Hs|pg||
nt|gulyas: then he will get the @Ds right obviously, but can he guess trumps too?|pg||
nt|gulyas: its normal to play @SA-@S from hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: S may also play @DA, small @C, but thats not likely|pg||

pc|h9|nt|gulyas: he will need to give up some tricks in the meantime, can he manage all that? lets see|pg||
nt|minimeck: he can survive two taps|pg||
nt|gulyas: its possible, take this, cash @HAK, lead a @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: taken, @HJ cashed, first tap|pg||
nt|gulyas: play a @D to the Q and A|pg||
nt|gulyas: second tap, and cross to dummy with the @Cs to take the finesse|pg||
nt|minimeck: that would work here, can go either way in diamonds, however :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|minimeck: he might simply hook east for the jack|pg||
nt|gulyas: but the wk jump makes W favourite to hold @D length|pg||
nt|minimeck: scanavino passes with the north hand, so more imps on the line|pg||
nt|gulyas: especially once E shows up with 6-3 in the majors|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|minimeck: wow|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to blame either side here|pg||
nt|rensph: 5NT asking keycards|pg||
pc|cA|nt|minimeck: too late to ask for keys|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rensph: they'll soon find out they're one too high already|pg||
nt|minimeck: east should double 6@d here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gulyas: when he tries @Cs, he will see that he also had 2@Cs, so he is most likely 6322|pg||
nt|minimeck: a tough ask holding a normal Ak :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was just going to type that it isn't worth doubling with the E hand because W may well pull it and a plus score may be changed to a minus|pg||
pc|c5|nt|minimeck: but ferro will lead a minor for sure|pg||
pc|c6|nt|minimeck: i predict he will lead the club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|minimeck: now they cannot go wrong :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|minimeck: this is a disaster, east got punished as his pard took it for takeout|pg||
nt|minimeck: helmich had to pick a red suit to find an entry with pard|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|minimeck: would take a ruff sluff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|minimeck: and there it is, 9 or so more for Ned|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  W, on other hand, should probably have bid 4@C and allowed pd to chose major (if he's going to bid at all)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|minimeck: another swing coming in on 22, Ferro in 4@h, still has to make it|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h6|pg||
nt|minimeck: in this situation could play that x of 3nt is somewhat similar to that of 4@s (an optional) double where pard can pull if very offensive|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|d4|nt|minimeck: but will sit with most hands|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, so 5 back to the leaders|pg||
nt|minimeck: i'm sure this board will be much discussed by all parties involved, i think both players actions here reasonable|pg||
nt|andyv:  that is does|pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile south passed the hand with KQxxxx in spades in 1st chair allowing the auction to develop naturally and they have settled in 4@s |pg||
nt|twcho: with doubleton @hJ falling, 3N is cold|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, has to get the @d right in that board|pg||
nt|pelu: I know - but general defense sh lead trump more often|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gulyas: so, ARG URU started the match well, but have a 34-0 against their 16-0, so down 18 already|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be a nice swing for arg uru|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@h can make|pg||
nt|minimeck: i completely agree|pg||
nt|minimeck: most players don't do it enough (myself included :) )|pg||
mb|2C|nt|minimeck: a prime 19, might just blast rkc|pg||
nt|andyv:  in fact a very decent contract|pg||
nt|guillemin: hi|pg||
nt|guillemin: all|pg||
nt|minimeck: an unlikely play|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5 to ned|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: but bypassing keycard to cue bid or (invite) slam always has that risk|pg||
nt|minimeck: bienvenidos Guille, welcome! @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Guille|pg||
nt|pelu: just my points to all kibs :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: need to find 3nt or 4s here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5 more bds to go, lets see what they can make out of it|pg||
nt|minimeck: the imps have been well deserved, they will have to stop the bleeding pretty quickly|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is 2 down only, while NS can even make slam with the lucky @H lie|pg||
nt|minimeck: these auctions are some of the toughest to handle, |pg||
nt|gulyas: nice 3nt made in the OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  hope NS have some other meaning for 3@h than a weak 3 bid|pg||
nt|guillemin: hola estaba mirando desde un principio con martin |pg||
mb|2S|nt|minimeck: most people play x here as "penalty-ish" but is more of an optional double|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: bob goes "all in with 5nt pick a slam"|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: now 3@d should be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: and garcia insta-saves, he trusts his opps|pg||
nt|minimeck: ferro lying in the weeds here|pg||
nt|minimeck: will balance for sure|pg||
nt|minimeck: appears Alejandro has gone down in 4@s, another 7 for Ned|pg||
mb|3N|nt|minimeck: interesting lead problem here for south|pg||
nt|minimeck: heart seems normal but 1.) which heart, and 2.) might give up a trick when passive is the way to go|pg||
nt|twcho: a small @c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he does have a useful 13 count|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d probabably Q ask|pg||
nt|minimeck: asking for the queen here, he's knows the missing keycard is the K of hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  10@h in S hand make this a better than 75% slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: but does not know pard has the jack |pg||
nt|minimeck: i predict he will bid it anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  even so, can play for 7-2-2-2 hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he doesn't know about the K@c|pg||
nt|twcho: wow, great lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: thats certainly an option, decides to attack hearts with the queen|pg||
nt|twcho: and very successful here|pg||
nt|minimeck: if he was going to lead hearts, the q seems normal here|pg||
nt|twcho: but still he has to find entry to his partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: all right, spec points out that @D lead beats 6@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the @H interiors falling, it should be easy sailng|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: yes, he would also be concerned it might have little to no play on a club lead, and that is what he has decided here|pg||
nt|andyv:  depending on style, I'd prefer a one @h or 4@h opener (more inclined to 4@h)|pg||
nt|minimeck: too many unknowns|pg||
nt|pelu: nice bidding by NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy as pie|pg||
pc|h4|nt|minimeck: wow, garcia has gone down in 4@h, |pg||
nt|minimeck: that will prove quite costly|pg||
nt|rensph: didn't play for the @H finesse, it seems|pg||
nt|minimeck: he didn't actually need the heart finese on his line|pg||
nt|minimeck: play here should be quick|pg||
nt|twcho: the @h holding can be reversed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. Wouldn't work with Jxx in dummy and Kxx in East, of course |pg||
pc|h5|nt|gulyas: E went for the insurance tho with 6@S, only going 800|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|minimeck: indeed, in theory the 10 has the same chance, but is much more deceptive, q paints a clear picture for pard|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: the way @Ss are, @S lead would have made life more difficult|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he still would have gotten home with 4@H-3@C-2 aces|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he needed to guess which finesse to take for that|pg||
nt|minimeck: thought for waaaay to long and put himself in the deep freeze, made a no play play|pg||
nt|andyv:  N hoping KQx(x) of @hs is to his left|pg||
pc|d3|nt|minimeck: just had to cash the club|pg||
nt|rensph: trying to cash the @ST couldn't really win|pg||
nt|pelu: even experts would have problem to find 3Nt, so nice see these yungsters bid so well|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|d4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|gulyas: could have gone for the cash @CAK, if no Q appears than @D finesse route|pg||
pc|cA|nt|minimeck: 16 imp swing and 5 to NED|pg||
nt|minimeck: a sigh of releif for their fans|pg||
nt|minimeck: a tough discard for north, now should make on the long spade|pg||
nt|twcho: the choice of a @s discard by north looks precarious|pg||
pc|c5|nt|minimeck: i am somewhat suprised by the auto save holding AQ of @h, saving on these auctions when opps have basically "guessed" to jump to slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: is a gamble|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|minimeck: and that's the ball game|pg||

nt|minimeck: NS had trouble sorting out the NS hand and ended up in 5@c|pg||
nt|minimeck: so a huge swing to Ned|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, I stand corrected: neither slam makes, so this may end up expensive|pg||
nt|minimeck: someone should drop a hint to the kibs in the other match :), we could decide this on the last board|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N from W side can't be touched|pg||
nt|minimeck: just a case of him asleep at the wheel|pg||
nt|twcho: after so many days of exhaustive matches|pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile excitement brewing in the playoff, only 24 imps now between the two sides, with their match only being 3 segments|pg||
mb|2H|nt|minimeck: 48 unanswered now and this will prove to be a tall order for Arg uru|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will bid 3@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|minimeck: as we have seen thus far, the southamericans have favored a more conservative approach|pg||
nt|minimeck: they will have to change gears to try and mount a comeback|pg||
nt|gulyas: N will try for game, and S will not accept|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the favourable @C lie, 3@H makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W should bid 3N but may opt for 5@cs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: pity|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: he just forgot the high spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: another normal game hand here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gulyas: N goes: what on earth did we agree on after 1M-2M?:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: strange enough, ARG missed this game at the other table, with 13-13HCP|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe 3@D was intended as forcing|pg||
nt|minimeck: despite a string of plus scores, north south will likely be feeling some concern, |pg||
nt|minimeck: looks like a bit too much for 4@h to fetch here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: on a @S lead 3NT is down tho|pg||
nt|minimeck: surely wackwitz will pick hearts here|pg||
nt|minimeck: but they will not go, i suspect east will compete|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: good bid here by Maxi, Da rosa looking for slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: surely he will not hang partner now|pg||
nt|andyv:  my apologies on bad anaylysis...3N doesn't have much of a chance with Q@d lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  E needs to pass this|pg||

nt|gulyas: just trying to make a little joke here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gulyas: as it is, no game is making, I can see that:) but could you always tell that and stop from 2 obv opening hands, and a decent fit?|pg||
nt|rensph: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: big bid by bob here|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rensph: N probably had a different picture of partner's hand in mind|pg||
nt|minimeck: although wackwitz doesn't have the typical takeout x, he has a right to expect a bit more|pg||
nt|minimeck: spectators tell me 2h promises 4 here, south regretting his initial double decided to try and get out as low as possible|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|minimeck: we gotchya, sometimes hard to read the tone (textually) just clarifying|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: both @S honors offside and also the @CK off, 3NT is down on a @S lead, and 5@D also has 3 tricks to lose|pg||
nt|minimeck: south is quite a fine experienced player, this double to me shows that he is pressing|pg||
nt|rensph: it doesn't really promise 4, you just bid your longest major so very few occasions on which you don't have a 4crd in the suit you bid.|pg||
nt|andyv:  very difficult for E to slow down but the stiff @d and minimum @c support should have stopped him|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|guillemin: i know Rodrigo will be bidding the slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: Rodrigo forced to slam on his own hand, certainly not the worst contract in the world, but, the speculative slam here gets what it deserves in my opinion|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @hs were 4-3, W might have had a chance here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|minimeck: vul with 3/3 in the majors no shortness, no nothing really|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|minimeck: that was my expectation if 2d was majors, kib informed me otherwise, either way|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gulyas: as some of my teachers used to say, you can gain imps by good bidding, bad bidding, good play and bad play:)|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|gulyas: this time a clear-cut 3nt|pg||
nt|gulyas: with 9 tricks, too:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: their*|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok here though, as North has extras|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  NS can get 4@s tricks and the 2 aces|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|minimeck: i would personally bid a traditional unusual 2nt (minors) |pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: and what a diamond position|pg||
pc|sT|nt|minimeck: second seat he can expect a "decent" pre=empt from his p, so decides 5c the best spot|pg||
nt|minimeck: WOW|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|minimeck: but in this case would have been the same|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|rensph: Well done by EW, W heard all he needed to know.|pg||
nt|rensph: Knows of @SAKQxx, @HK and @CA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|minimeck: a pretty decent grand here, needs some cooperation in the majors|pg||
nt|minimeck: anyone want to through out a % for this?|pg||
nt|minimeck: throw*|pg||
nt|rensph: On a diamond lead it's less than 50%|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|minimeck: if he were going to bid his hand like this, might have been better served to pre-empt, as is, 80% of his points are in south's minors, |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|minimeck: ARG URU have stopped in 2@h on 29|pg||
nt|minimeck: that could make or -1 for 6 or 9 for them|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  now damage should only be 100|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|minimeck: the wheels have come off the bus in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gulyas: draw trumps, duck a @D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|minimeck: and another double digit swing to NED|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h3|pc|dA|nt|minimeck: still six all day for def|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|c7|nt|minimeck: keep in mind everyone, this is the semifinals so the losing teams here will have a playoff for the bronze medal|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: claim|pg||
mc|10|nt|andyv:  i guess so...thought E could shake a @d but doesn't appear to be so|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all|pg||
