nt|minimeck: Garcia Da Rosa and Crusizio are a very experienced pair, have played for a long time but this is their first international competition together.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: HI|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW should get too high in @H here.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||
nt|athene: just lose the sixth club most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2c=d or majors|pg||
nt|minimeck: if any kibitzers have info about the NS pair, it is appreciated :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you need to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: moysian 6@d here|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a big fan of that sort of thing though|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|athene: it helps if you can make unusual notrump bids later in the auction with confidence partner will know you are showing diamonds of course :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: nine tricks available in 3nt here with both kings onside :) |pg||

nt|ybob: el mejor fit es en @S pero dificil ovbiar el @H|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  EW managed to pitch away their @d stopper.  This will be a sizable pick up for Japan|pg||
nt|gsper:  Or all other leads are worse; not uncommon:)|pg||
nt|athene: there was no reason on that hand to suspect that declarer was going to throw diamond losers away fast on a side suit|pg||
nt|athene: and no reason to put north with a big diamond...|pg||
nt|athene: so diamond lead is dubious i think|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously had a good hand so there was lots of time for him to get in and play diamonds|pg||
nt|minimeck: we will try and get a second commentator in here |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good day|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: even with @ss 4-0 4@S sh make|pg||
nt|minimeck: on a power distribution hand like that,  would hate not to be able to show it in some shape or form |pg||
nt|gsper:  Do they play forcing 1NT?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 50% contract I suppose was fair enough but would have passed with N hand|pg||
nt|gsper:  Sounds persuasive.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: Championship page http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/Opatija11.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: not alerted 1 nt|pg||
nt|rensph: semi-forcing most likely|pg||
nt|minimeck: this year they have changed the format to have all day knockout matches, in the previous event the quarters and semis were both played in one day|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mrdct: 4@h a chance here for EW|pg||
nt|pelu: that a new way to show 5 card @s|pg||
nt|ybob: nice shoot 3NT :)|pg||
nt|ferlema: la voz de 3NT fue apresurada|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Sorry, still too early for me.  A sizable pick up for Turkey :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile Ferro went "all in" with a 4@h opener on the first board, recieved max punishment and went down for 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: what is semi-fp|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: cards very friendly for NS here , 3@s by north strictly competative, no game interest|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S por N|pg||
nt|Walddk5: semi-forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 1 or 2 more imps for japan here|pg||
nt|pelu: tell us Andrea - what would 1@s from W show?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 CARDS |pg||
nt|rensph: not quite forcing but you tend to bid on|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: tough call - lousy spade suit 4333 defensive hand vul do you want to balance ... who knows|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzmw: I MENA 2 SPADES SHOWS 3 CARDS|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: MEAN|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the open south chose to make a cue instead of single raise, got them to game|pg||
nt|ybob: 3NT p 4@S  p p p|pg||
nt|exerdar: e-w started very good  in first boards|pg||
nt|rensph: range 6-11 or so|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Can a woman be semi-pregnant? No, either she is or she is not, and either a bid is forcing or it is not|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|galois85: Dbl  at first round shows 4@s+ 1@s is a sputnik dbl without spades ( of mancinelli I mean)|pg||
nt|pelu: was 2@S forcing? - or an underbid?|pg||
nt|ferlema: debería perder una baza por palo|pg||
nt|henryb:  means partner can pass with balanced 11-13, but can bid 3 card minor with constructive hand, Roland|pg||
nt|gsper:  Sounds much like Culbertson and Goren played it.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, no, not Goren, who played 1N as 6-9|pg||
nt|gsper:  OK, 3-card minor rebid is not Culbertson either.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: japan came 3rd in the asia-pacific championships in kuala lumpur in june so have qualified for next year's world youth championships expect to be in cuba|pg||
nt|galois85: underbid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: juniors are normalt not afraid of bidding, but for sure Mancinelli is :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: THEY'RE DISCUSSINE EAST DENIES 4 CARDS SUPPORT IN SPADE|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk5: I don't buy that Henry. So you pass with KQxxx  Axx  xxx  Kxx  where you can be cold for 4@H|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|exerdar: but look like they lose  a game  here|pg||
nt|gsper:  4@H obviously does not make. Perversely, I think 3NT would hava had a chance.|pg||
nt|athene: north had a cunning plan:- give his partner some heart ruffs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk5: take a card away from a minor|pg||
nt|henryb:  down to 20%, and that only with misdefense: needs @hA onside doubleton and that N doesn't give a ruff with the @hA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Look, Roland, I don't make the rules, I only tell it like it is. You may not like the treatment, but that does not give you license to say it does not or should not exist|pg||
nt|minimeck: first blood to turkey|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ybob: apresurado jugar triunfo y tomar de A por Este|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Animesh|pg||
nt|henryb:  Me, I play a 1N response is non-forcing but wide range|pg||
nt|gsper:  How many down would 4@D have been?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west's double was helpful to opponents|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west had far too many clubs for a lead in that suit to be productive|pg||
nt|kemperg: so do I|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: Andrea, can u tell us about the players - I exp that the 2 italian teams here are 2.. 3. or 4. best?|pg||
nt|galois85: well of course the singleton  in the first suite of his partner seems a bad distribution, but after knowing that the king of hearts maybe is well placed and the 4cards fit of my ...|pg||
nt|galois85: partner I surely bid 4... |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|animeshraj: hello everyone|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  This is some very nice defense|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Hi Animesh :)|pg||
nt|animeshraj: hi:) jenni|pg||
pc|sK|nt|galois85: well I think most of the italian players are at their first of second experience.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|minimeck: at all tempted to make a game try on the north hand william?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he has six spades|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk5: But 2/1 is GF?|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: exept 1M 2@C|pg||
nt|gsper:  And how is that different from semi-forcing as described, Henry?|pg||

nt|minimeck: good morning murat & welcome!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk5: 3@H fine and what if you belong in 6@C?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 6@c on lets see if they get there|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 7@d bid on board one very well done and +15 imps|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt opener possible with west|pg||
nt|athene: of course you have an easy rebid with 4-5 black suits but even so|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@s for NS and maybe 3@d for EW here|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  With the same defense, it looks like Japan will pick up 3 imps|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont like the quality of th @Hs|pg||
nt|henryb:  tough|pg||
nt|athene: it's getting more common to simplify things with 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H some cunning bid, maybe "spades or minors"|pg||
nt|athene: this is something i think we will see more of in the future - tricky defences to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: it is|pg||
mb|1H|nt|galois85: 2@d natural or weak fit |pg||
nt|exerdar: for running skores |pg||
nt|exerdar: very important advantage  in 10 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: spad or minors|pg||
nt|athene: the main advantage simply comes from opponents' unfamiliarity|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. what does double mean; what does the "cue" mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: anyway east calls td because wasn't clear explained on front page of cc|pg||
nt|murat: thank you Matt :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: to be fair the hands did fit extremely well|pg||
nt|athene: it was very hard to diagnose that|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, bos' 2@d call seems to have disuaded him enough |pg||
nt|exerdar: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: dbl shows hearts|pg||
nt|athene: hearts are the one suit north can't hold; i don't know if south's pass suggests playing there anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: south didn't alerted|pg||
nt|minimeck: possible partial swing to turkey, multi by west on  3|pg||
nt|murat: as you are just informed by Matt, NS is a well experienced junior pair|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrdct: but lack of entries to south's hand make it hard to make 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S in family with Guiseppe Failla, who played for the Blue team?|pg||
nt|minimeck: with qxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  clubs, as Edgar Kaplan said, were relegated to the trash heap in the 40's already. We don't bid no steenkin clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Right, dump Stayman|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: dbls getting lighter and lighter every year ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: north neither|pg||
nt|minimeck: might get too high, however|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  If 2@D is now 4th suit, E has a real problem.|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: 1@c = 16+ any shape, x by lean is exactly 6-7|pg||
nt|gsper:  But the Italians have sort of revived club slams.|pg||
nt|henryb:  clubs as natural, that is. See Gazzilli, Stayman, Drury|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, EW will pretend it started 1@C 1@H 1@S uncontested|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt is fair enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW trying for 3NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: lien*|pg||
nt|athene: north and south both downgraded their red queen under the bid suit i suspect|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|galois85: I think the son|pg||
nt|athene: but this downgrading is overdone i think|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you are talking: Gazzilli!|pg||

nt|moonbeam42:  Dbl lets him get out to @d|pg||
nt|minimeck: wow, big bid by Rodrigo here, a good agressive game vul :) will need to guess the diamond, is 2@s here intermediate ?|pg||

nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: no hay forma de perder |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that lacks vision 2@h is a jump good hand and must have 5+@c - in that context S has a very good hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: u see I know almost more than u :):):)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2nd x here just t/o|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be a quiet 110 here|pg||
nt|kemperg: we dont miss many minr contracts that way|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, South may bid a @d slam, but N will correct|pg||
nt|athene: north might now find it hard to bid 2@S |pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct: played by west on a @s lead might be OK|pg||
nt|galois85: =)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: giuseppe is now responsible for youth  in italy|pg||
nt|pelu: hard job|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt interesting on small heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: five rounds of diamonds give east a few worries|pg||
nt|athene: you might throw him in with a heart to lead a club|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, and that is where the open room has arrived, we shall see how it goes|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4@H looks like cold, but Uluer's need play carefuly , if he quess to AJ doubletone @d can make plus trick|pg||
nt|athene: west showed spades, and maybe south hasn't got any|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: but i think the defence should prevail |pg||
nt|ferlema: si, estan todas las cartas bien puestas|pg||
nt|ybob: aún no acertando el @D|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Not sure what 3@c is. |pg||
nt|animeshraj: MAYBE @D's trf oe something like that|pg||

nt|galois85: Giuseppe is also watching the match at this table|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Yeah, maybe|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|mrdct: as it happens a passive @d lead may have been best to let declarer do all of the work|pg||

pc|sT|nt|Walddk5: After 10 rounds, top 8 advance to the quarter-finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|gsper:  Top honour, acc to another kib.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suspect it just showed an honor to tell partner it was safe to lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: that lead here will prove quite costly|pg||

nt|murat: after the lead it's intresting now |pg||
nt|murat: normally defence gets 3@h and a trump|pg||
nt|minimeck: although crusizio had a lead problem, spade feels like it is a passive lead, pretty risky in reality, |pg||
nt|murat: with the lead Uçar has a chance to avoid the trump lose|pg||
nt|minimeck: still not 100%, east could certainly have 109|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: 5@H: woid-wood - asking for Aces outside @h|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well done S I'd say many with that very good 15 count would double or try 3@d ,,, the 1NT warned him off|pg||
nt|minimeck: so some guesswork left to do :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|halila: another heart game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s loses a @d and a @c and possibly a @h depending on how you play that suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: a shoulder shrugging pass from dwyer, at these colors he expects a normalish opener from p, but still nothing to bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: same contract both tables should be flat|pg||
nt|rensph: If XX shows an honour, you shouldn't redouble with the queen imo. Don't want partner to have to guess whether to lead his AJxxx|pg||

nt|minimeck: or play for Qx of @s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: i thought turkey was ahead before we crashed|pg||
nt|galois85: I think just good fit in spades invitational to slam. maybe dbl after 2@d shows hearts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Anybody knows NS methods against 1NT?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: but stripping @c and and easy endplay with guarantee 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: same 5@h in CR - and 5@s by N|pg||
nt|athene: three chances even - declarer has to knock out a lot of cards|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|minimeck: as he has done|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: so the plan will be to draw trumps, ruff a @c and then play @DAKx to endplay either opponent|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|mrdct: can actually claim on this line after drawing 1 round of trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is always good fun|pg||
nt|minimeck: scores very tightly bunched in the Q-zone, with such a short qualifyer, alot of pressure on these players|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: teams were entered in the reverse way|pg||
nt|minimeck: still time to discard the heart losers by picking up clubs :)|pg||
nt|murat: east had a problem with the lead. heart lead is not an option. so only diamond lead does not hurt|pg||
nt|murat: he will go 2 off probably|pg||

nt|kemperg: in a @C contract, see discussion before:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: borderline decision for west over 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: play 4@S or make a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|ybob: otro 3NT sin problema |pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: S is in 3@HX on this board in the other room.... might get bloody|pg||
mb|p|nt|halila: ý think it is wrongly written|pg||
nt|athene: now opener has room to bid 4@H to show a good hand for spades i guess|pg||
nt|athene: he has mostly "hard" cards, so he might do that|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C 3NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: despite having only two spades|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to imagine a slam - but 4@H now might do the trick|pg||
nt|athene: east has a really huge hand, all the aces and a fifth heart|pg||
nt|gsper:  6@H is good here, but may go down in practice.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS likely here|pg||
nt|athene: quite control-rish|pg||
nt|athene: rich|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKQ doubleton, which was the flaw when he opened, is suddenly worth a lot|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt looks a bit much, though|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: boring 4@S unless e/w find the 5 of a minor sac, 5@c being better (in 5@d @C ruff available)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: i don't see how you can go down in 6@H?|pg||
nt|athene: if double is penalty-oriented i really don't like it that much|pg||
nt|athene: but of course 4@H is a bit unilateral and might be very wrong|pg||
nt|gsper:  You are right, if the worst comes to the worst there is a squeeze on N.|pg||
nt|athene: can't you just ruff two clubs in the west hand?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Uruguay on the board after turkey let 3@s through on 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: apart from anything, the limited hand isn't normally the one to take control|pg||
nt|athene: not in well-controlled auctions anyway :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Bos will have to activate his sonar and find the diamond jack :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is interesting|pg||
mb|3S|nt|halila: it can be down with a careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamonds 5-1 means the limit of hand is 1nt|pg||
nt|henryb:  Thanks, Matt|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  How could E not bid slam now?  He's gotta take at least a push now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: interesting that NS put balanced 20-counts into their 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: what to bid in S - 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: and is 2Nt naturel or for minor?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see that he can know his partner has good values|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  E-W here could save the day by reaching and making 6@c|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4sp normal contract here|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, but decl may feel that that risks a defensive ruff.|pg||
nt|athene: why shouldn't west have the same shape without, say, the @HK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Is it necessary to jump to 4@H?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Academic now anyway.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south may solve that problem for him at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: difficult - i guess if you want to be passive, a trump lead is preferable|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea tough lead problem for lien, trump club, diamond?|pg||
nt|minimeck: trump seems the safest, not going to pick off pard with q@s :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you operator, yes, :) k@h not possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: diamond might well find partner's honour for them; i like a trump here, although you don't usually lead a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: @HK into a 2nt opener....hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but 3|pg||
nt|athene: as a rule, it's right to lead aggressively against 6 of a suit, but this auction might be an exception|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt on here, but probably hard to bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  4@h looks doomed, though - No Roland, its not.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I think with all controls and 5 trumps, you shoudl at least have 5 level safety|pg||
nt|minimeck: turkey is a very talent rich country for players at all levels of competition, can you tell us anything about the EW pair at the other table murat?|pg||
nt|murat: yes sure|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: the @h7 is a big card here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt better than 3@C - West can get 2@d ruffs|pg||
nt|galois85: yes... 2nt I think is natural|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this would slowly end up in 4@S. ..  |pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - where did East get that 3@H from?|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason you would lead a heart is to set up a trick fast before declarer throws heart losers on a side suit|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|minimeck: lools like 11 tricks likely here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|minimeck: indeed, definetely merit to leading the heart|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: that is unlikely to be the issue here|pg||
nt|gsper:  And NS in 3@H at other table? Sounds like the Menagerie.|pg||
nt|henryb:  only if both tables make the contract :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: @D8: signal for @s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mrdct: as is the @h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|halila: is tkere any way to confuse the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Diamond switch may be needed now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: To force declarer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: All academic with the 1400 from the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now he can win in dummy and take the club finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  still 3 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and he retains control|pg||
nt|Walddk5: as he no longer can be forced|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 4: difference between 17 and 13|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d4|nt|pelu: Pionto just dropped at trick|pg||
nt|athene: but of course it's easy to construct layouts where a heart is the only lead to beat|pg||
pc|s4|nt|minimeck: 26 imp swing coming|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ugis: however, if 1s = 11-15, w might bid on over 1nt. And then they would reach 3nt |pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: declarer can ruff the long heart good but he still has to get to hand to cash it|pg||
nt|minimeck: alot of options now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|animeshraj: really|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: @C9 looks the least useful card from the easy hand|pg||
nt|athene: easT hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: if this were the open event, we'd now see a 5-10 minute tank|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|exerdar: if be declared 3nt  @sQ on and @HKwins  ,could be a swing for Ned|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|nt|athene: diamond back right now|pg||
nt|minimeck: 20 seconds and there it is|pg||
nt|athene: but it's too late|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has to decide whether to finesse or play to bring the heart down but whatever he chooses will work|pg||
nt|minimeck: seems he's just got to go with the odds here|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|mrdct: ned young a chance to get a donut in this match|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: he hoped that south would win the @DA and leave him with some options|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  That was going to be a huge pitch :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: he would have a harder problem if the @DQ held|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|halila: this way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however west has set himself up to be endplayed|pg||
pc|s7|nt|animeshraj: amazing duck:)|pg||

nt|henryb:  actually a little better|pg||
nt|minimeck: 8 card major suit fit and 25 high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 4@h makes NS here|pg||
nt|ybob: 8 bazas es el límite en @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  minimally better|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@C hearts?|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec tells 52.5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hearts confirmed|pg||
nt|gsper:  A low trump lead might beat 7@D;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@H showing 4 spades or 6+?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H both majors i imagine|pg||
nt|murat: that's suprising|pg||
pc|cA|nt|halila: no problem  on 3nt|pg||
nt|ugis: 4s a good sacrifice here against 4h|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, no, because you lose to QJ doubleton in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2 club transfer for hearts|pg||
nt|kemperg: swithces must used by the younger Dutch ( and an older one like me:))|pg||
nt|henryb:  you gain against stiff Q or J in the same hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 6@H now practical bridge, or even 6@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can forget about science|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: double shows 4+ hearts cards|pg||
nt|murat: declerar has no chance |pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, there's no real way to "know" the mirror of the xxx opposite Jxx in @h, very fortunate|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mrdct: i know what i will lead as south|pg||
nt|pelu: look at that over 2@D on a very bad 5 card suit - not in my book - do u like that overcall?|pg||
nt|athene: if he bids 3nt now he shows just choice of games?|pg||
nt|ybob: se gana 4@H E-W|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be 4c 2s and 2d for the def |pg||
nt|minimeck: which suit to get to partner, however, is the question|pg||
nt|murat: 7@h|pg||
nt|minimeck: that's certainly the safe play, looking at dummy seems right|pg||
pc|s3|nt|animeshraj: wow thats some pass...|pg||
nt|ugis: and I would bid 4s as E|pg||
nt|henryb:  The earth is flat, and created in 6 days in 4004 BC|pg||
pc|s4|nt|halila: a flat bord|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting methods but the normal contract non-theless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: exactly four spades|pg||
nt|athene: there is some merit to this sort of thing, the idea being to conceal from the defenders whether declarer has four hearts|pg||
nt|athene: since that isn't of any interest to east|pg||
nt|kemperg: will play @D to the Ace|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: IF i was forced to bid I would X - but a clæear pass for me|pg||
nt|athene: some would achieve a similar result using 2nt as puppet e.g. 2nt 3@C [no 5major] now 3@H showing four spades|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ugis: normally 1s=5+ so with an 11 card fit EW should be rather comfortable in 4s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: they took a different route from everyone else but they got to the same place :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||

pc|c7|nt|animeshraj: good judjement . south's hand marginal.. for G try. maybe not too keen at NV.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pelu: tx Andrea|pg||
nt|minimeck: even the top experts disagree on alot of methodology, so as a good lesson for everyone, just know what you and your partner play :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzmw: 10+ hcp , 3 cards support|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  2N = natural and forcing?|pg||
nt|kemperg: both sides play a 4-8 or 2-6 muiderberg, 5M + 4+ m|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 and 2nd hand green againt red|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: double alerted because it's 4 or 5 spades?|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  ahh, thanks|pg||
nt|exerdar:  slam try possible from south|pg||
nt|gsper:  And if not green againt red?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mrdct: mirrored @d layout here is bad for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: can only make 2@h|pg||
nt|galois85: maybe 4 spades and a club I would think about bidding a dbl (maybe I would not...but was possible) but in this situation easy pass|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally it would show precisely 4, but especially when the 1@D can be short, you want 1@S as a general t/o without spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5@d now by lien|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W gana 4@H por 2da vez consecutiva|pg||
nt|ugis: I thought W will surprise N with 3 club bid...but he chose dbl|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6-10, |pg||
nt|athene: hands with both minors are awkward to show after an opposing weak-two|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: red we need 55|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: *3 clubs I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: mostly you just have to bid 3@D but that can easily lead to a club fit being lost|pg||
nt|minimeck: and back to a very tight match here|pg||
nt|murat: yes. getting excited|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: need to cash 3@d immedaitely|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrdct: on this lead a @d loser goes on the @SAk|pg||
nt|ugis: 3c from N slowed down S|pg||
nt|ugis: not such an easy contract due to communication problems and bad breaks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: 4-1-5-3 and 10+ ok for a TO D|pg||
nt|athene: looks like par|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H making exactly, this is one down|pg||
nt|ybob: en realidad hay pocas perdedoras pero no son seguras 10 bazas en 4@H|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|halila: now 4h played by right side|pg||
nt|animeshraj: west hand doesnot warrant a cue IMO.|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo uses a 3@C overcall specifically to show both minors and that might be a good idea i think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  Germ, are the youngsters afraid of having their bidding boxes taken away when they get over 30, so they have to get all their lifetime bids in before then? :_|pg||
nt|kemperg: suppose so :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, they just don't have any pass cards in them|pg||
nt|gsper:  When they are 30, bidding boxes will be old hat.|pg||
nt|kemperg: we had an older player missing 7NT in his box|pg||
pc|d2|nt|halila: as you see|pg||
pc|h3|nt|moonbeam42:  W hand has already said he's not interested in game, 3@s may have demanded a cue|pg||
nt|animeshraj: well if it demands... then forced 2|pg||
nt|kemperg: told him thats good for him.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ah, pass cards are issued at age 30 in Holland. Well I'm glad my Senior team will have access to them in Veldhovn|pg||
nt|minimeck: a pretty friendly hand here, trumps split, q of clubs onside|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|halila: other wise it is difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not sure it really matters|pg||
nt|pelu: they have all controls - and 6@H just need @Hs 3-2 , u can ruff a @S and disc a @C on @d|pg||
nt|galois85: on a heart guess 6@h or 6!nt thanks to the jxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|minimeck: shouldn't be too hard to defend, but no gaurantees :x|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: not sure how i'd play this - communications are really tied up - maybe double @c finese best|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|pelu: if u only look at NS-card then 6@H a perfect slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 5 diamonds shows 4 aces.....|pg||
nt|pelu: but 7 - just bad bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, they are supposed to bring their own|pg||
nt|kemperg: You dont believe what happend in the matcH:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Did you not get that letter from the WBF?|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to gamble at the 5-level and gets lucky - luckyish,anyway|pg||
nt|gsper:  I can see problems with that, but Garozzo tends to know what he is doing.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|exerdar: board 6 same contract  ,2Imp for Nederlands|pg||
nt|Walddk5: NL ran out of pass cards; they are all with the youngsters|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They use them as ID for the night clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Let me 'pass'|pg||
nt|kemperg: N not happy with his bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzmw: fruscoloni sayd|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Andrea - is 5@D 0-3 or 1-4?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|galois85: well but failla supposed his partner to have also the @hk|pg||
nt|gsper:  It was quite aggressive with both opps bidding.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|galois85: 1-4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|rensph: well neither opponent actually promised any real values|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|h7|nt|animeshraj: but if its optional... then he should just bid 4H. its an effective 8hcp opener.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Obviously E didn't take him for much since he passed 4@h|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|kdr_fm: relieved to see that @ck|pg||
nt|minimeck: duck of the spade will not cost much here for Koclar :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gsper:  Could 2@S have been psychic or something?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rensph: 2@H might be anything and 2@S was in hope of finding a better place to play|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzmw: mancinelli has just ruffed a spade with the king heart and next palyed the spade, established|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@H down 1 = unlucky - 7@H down just bad bridge :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: seven made|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: no words|pg||
nt|minimeck: play here, however, has been "lightning" fast|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: How??????|pg||
nt|galois85: well also 5@h = is quite bad bridge =) 6 is to call |pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: made with the revoke|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: east just better not pitch his small club|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: otherwise declarer can duck a club|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: west showed his cards|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2 more to go in this segment, one more match today followed by 5 more matches tommorow in the qualifying phase|pg||
nt|animeshraj: E too had a Quacky 16 ... 3@S bit agg too on 3H s/off|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if S could have played low would have had a real problem.  A good line - added the chance of @HQx|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double dummy a finesse or two and a good @S guess will bring in 6@c|pg||
nt|murat: nice hand|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pelu: and from E I for sure dont like the lead of @h2 - a 100% @S-lead|pg||
nt|ybob: 9 bazas para E-W en @S|pg||
nt|athene: a heavy 1nt there|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: yes, he did it|pg||
nt|animeshraj: turks found the winning @c lead.... next door 13imps to them|pg||
nt|animeshraj: yeah... 17:)|pg||
nt|athene: some pass cunningly with the east cards, hoping to be on lead vs 3nt in a while|pg||
nt|athene: but if south shows hearts you might regret being so cunning|pg||
mb|1H|nt|minimeck: indeed, a few juniors might root for a joe grue(esque) 2nt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north probably worth 2@H now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Pass in 3rd at favourable would be a psyche|pg||
nt|athene: also, if you actually have 3nt on, beating 1nt by a lot of 50s isn't much compensation|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: assuming that's a sound raise|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, they play xfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i doubt south will get over-excited|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3@C puppet or baron or stayman anyone know ?|pg||
nt|minimeck: spec properly points out they have a specialized system here for this, 2nt not 18-19 as standard, some sort of unbalanced forcing hand|pg||
nt|murat: i believe this 2NT has 3 meanings|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mrdct: EW will go for the vul game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: how many times i have to say made|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3c should buy the pot|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if puppet south now knows the opps have 10 hearts between them (3NT normally denies a 4CM)|pg||
nt|athene: however, this way they miss 3nt|pg||
nt|minimeck: we shall see where it leads, 6@c pretty much ice cold baring 5-1 hearts and the singleton having a club|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|mrdct: but no joy with @DAJ10 and @HK offside i think|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C alerted i suppose because he had good/bad 2NT available|pg||
nt|athene: they didn't ditch that even after the board 2 disaster :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 club invitationa|pg||
nt|minimeck: votes for 2@s in third seat? worked effectively in the open|pg||
nt|minimeck: pushed them to 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3nt only denies majors|pg||
nt|gsper:  He probably would have missed 3NT if he had passed too.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S looks ok for me|pg||
nt|animeshraj: u want to balance here! but the V may stop you|pg||
nt|murat: long clubs gf, long clubs inv with 3 cards @h and i dont remember the 3rd one :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3d transfer to hearts?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|murat: it should be asking|pg||
mb|4D|nt|fabsayc: south is not really good enough to cue bid, but maybe ok in their style|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be able to get the @s loser away on a @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not enough|pg||
nt|mrdct: this hand is a good illustration of why 4333s are worth -1hcp|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree seems the normal bid, |pg||
nt|kemperg: let them escape|pg||
nt|athene: yes, probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: 3nt has no chances|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: unless you have some very convenient agreement|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be no trouble now|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|nt|animeshraj: he did venture,, brave bid !...... but not recomendeD LOL :) at 5332 and that suit that V.|pg||
nt|athene: like, passing over 1nt and then bidding 3@D later after north transfers, shows a solid diamond suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: The defence can't afford that declarer gets a diamond trick|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@D was 4 down|pg||
nt|gsper:  It seems that N psyched at the other tabe.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and so did East|pg||

nt|ugis: was smth wrong with the bidding?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: the complain to some different explanation about the 3 spade double by west|pg||

mb|p|nt|minimeck: credit netherlands for a well played match, besides the first board, some good play all around|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Yes.  A total of 5 matches today and then tomorrow starts the KO phase|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: you're wellcome|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and thanks to Germ, Henry and Rens for commentary|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: 1@D - 1@S - 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east perhaps debating between 2 and 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C might have ended the auction|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C normally promises more high cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  Congratulation to W on this problem.|pg||
nt|athene: unless you play gazzilli here|pg||
nt|athene: then it shows specifically that sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: a lot of playing strength but not so many hcp|pg||
nt|minimeck: would not be possible in an event such as the bermuda bowl, with a week long round robin and 120 board ko matches :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894  for running scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 16.30|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Next round in about 31 minutes 38.9812 secs|pg||
nt|kemperg: tks Goran, Roland, Henry specs and our operator|pg||
nt|athene: i guess not playing gazzilli i would go with 3@C too, just hope to survive|pg||
mb|d|nt|moonbeam42:  The next set will start about 90 min from now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: here I would just bid 3Nt in W why make the bidding more complex?|pg||
nt|galois85: I again agree with peter... 10 with ad in @s 2Nt is a better choice|pg||
nt|athene: double of 1@D = 4+ hearts i assume|pg||
nt|athene: and double of 2@D is support (3 hearts)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: @C bloqueado, sin chance de ganar|pg||
nt|gsper:  And I would bid 2@C, just hoping to survive.-|pg||

nt|minimeck: wow, excitement now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|galois85: to play 3@d it seems...|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Or, perhaps just 60 minutes ;)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt here is simply ice cold with 3-3 clubs and diamonds splitting|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk5: sorry, I forgot Göran, thanks to you too|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looking at the scores I am going to guess that it will take about 164 or so to reach the quarters|pg||
pc|sK|nt|minimeck: according to rodwell, 1nt on those hands is by faaar a % winner, but don't ask me to explain the science :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|minimeck: you'd have to look in his secret files to which i don't have access|pg||
nt|athene: the trend at the top level is to open 1nt more and more on the "middling strength" 5422 and even 5431 hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the end, a flat board to finish us out|pg||
nt|athene: because it simplifies things|pg||
nt|minimeck: specifically also with stiff k|pg||
nt|athene: lots of ways you run into trouble opening, for example, 4-5-2-2 15 count with 1@H|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Thanks operator|pg||
nt|animeshraj: gd sac agst a making 3@C.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i bet 2@C would get the most votes in a bridge world poll|pg||
nt|minimeck: can't blame north for doubling for the spade lead, but doubling freely bid games for the lead like this, is not without risk as we see here|pg||
nt|minimeck: the theory being you're almost sure they aren't gonna make overtricks, if they win 4 imps by making exactly 9, so be it, but the spade lead could produce a 12 imp win|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: 1Nt here - In my book = 8-10, so easy 3Nt from W|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|animeshraj: low H now..|pg||
nt|minimeck: (until they redouble that is) which changes the math a bit :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h8|nt|athene: partner bids 1nt and you wish you opened 1nt|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ybob: había que descartar @C en N|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's worst nightmare on a big two-suiter like this is always losing trump control|pg||
nt|murat: exactly. this will only cost for 5imps|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|guillemin: excelente resultado para el equipo sudamericano|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: well, best chance to make a stiff king is to open 1nt :)|pg||

nt|ybob: para luego el otro @C sobre K @H|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|halila: an unlucky board |pg||
nt|mrdct: if he gets @h right chance to get opps to open up the @s suit|pg||
