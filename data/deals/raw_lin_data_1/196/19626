nt|ybob: nice spanish Murat :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||
nt|athene: just lose the sixth club most of the time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mrdct: moysian 6@d here|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a big fan of that sort of thing though|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: it helps if you can make unusual notrump bids later in the auction with confidence partner will know you are showing diamonds of course :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt extremely unlikely to be the best contract when you have such a shapely two-suiter|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: 3nt is for balanced hands and one-suiters|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, agreed, very suprising, especially if 3h was a cue|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|athene: was 2NT just general good/bad?|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|galois85: it seems -1 by guessing the @dj |pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps the operator could inform us of the alerts|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might not realise they have any diamond fit at all - he might just think 2nt was showing a competitive 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES IT WAS|pg||
nt|athene: i would just rebid 3@D with the east hand, and if i get too high, so be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: west explained it could be weak with clubs or some good hands|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: ahora @D al K , J @D finesse y gana|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|minimeck: an immediate answer for the US, EW have bid to 6@d after a 3h overcall and 4d bid|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: undo that - the @s hook and @c break are only good for 10 tricks|pg||

nt|ybob: 1@C 3NT|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: despite having only two spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS likely here|pg||
nt|athene: quite control-rish|pg||
nt|athene: rich|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKQ doubleton, which was the flaw when he opened, is suddenly worth a lot|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt looks a bit much, though|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: apart from anything, the limited hand isn't normally the one to take control|pg||
nt|athene: not in well-controlled auctions anyway :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Bos will have to activate his sonar and find the diamond jack :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|halila: it can be down with a careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamonds 5-1 means the limit of hand is 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: interesting that NS put balanced 20-counts into their 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: what to bid in S - 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: and is 2Nt naturel or for minor?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|athene: south may solve that problem for him at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: difficult - i guess if you want to be passive, a trump lead is preferable|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea tough lead problem for lien, trump club, diamond?|pg||
nt|minimeck: trump seems the safest, not going to pick off pard with q@s :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you operator, yes, :) k@h not possible|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: diamond might well find partner's honour for them; i like a trump here, although you don't usually lead a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: @HK into a 2nt opener....hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but 3|pg||
nt|athene: as a rule, it's right to lead aggressively against 6 of a suit, but this auction might be an exception|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mrdct: the @h7 is a big card here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt better than 3@C - West can get 2@d ruffs|pg||
nt|galois85: yes... 2nt I think is natural|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - where did East get that 3@H from?|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason you would lead a heart is to set up a trick fast before declarer throws heart losers on a side suit|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|minimeck: indeed, definetely merit to leading the heart|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: that is unlikely to be the issue here|pg||

pc|c9|nt|minimeck: 26 imp swing coming|pg||

nt|minimeck: 20 seconds and there it is|pg||

pc|d8|nt|athene: declarer now has to decide whether to finesse or play to bring the heart down but whatever he chooses will work|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|minimeck: 2 more to go in this segment, one more match today followed by 5 more matches tommorow in the qualifying phase|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and from E I for sure dont like the lead of @h2 - a 100% @S-lead|pg||
nt|ybob: 9 bazas para E-W en @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: yes, he did it|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|athene: north probably worth 2@H now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: assuming that's a sound raise|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphzmw: how many times i have to say made|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3c should buy the pot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: but no joy with @DAJ10 and @HK offside i think|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C alerted i suppose because he had good/bad 2NT available|pg||
nt|athene: they didn't ditch that even after the board 2 disaster :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 club invitationa|pg||
nt|minimeck: votes for 2@s in third seat? worked effectively in the open|pg||
nt|minimeck: pushed them to 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S looks ok for me|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: south is not really good enough to cue bid, but maybe ok in their style|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be able to get the @s loser away on a @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not enough|pg||
nt|mrdct: this hand is a good illustration of why 4333s are worth -1hcp|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 1@D - 1@S - 2NT?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: here I would just bid 3Nt in W why make the bidding more complex?|pg||
nt|galois85: I again agree with peter... 10 with ad in @s 2Nt is a better choice|pg||
nt|athene: double of 1@D = 4+ hearts i assume|pg||
nt|athene: and double of 2@D is support (3 hearts)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ybob: @C bloqueado, sin chance de ganar|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|galois85: to play 3@d it seems...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|minimeck: according to rodwell, 1nt on those hands is by faaar a % winner, but don't ask me to explain the science :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|minimeck: you'd have to look in his secret files to which i don't have access|pg||
nt|athene: the trend at the top level is to open 1nt more and more on the "middling strength" 5422 and even 5431 hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the end, a flat board to finish us out|pg||
nt|athene: because it simplifies things|pg||
nt|minimeck: specifically also with stiff k|pg||
nt|athene: lots of ways you run into trouble opening, for example, 4-5-2-2 15 count with 1@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: 1Nt here - In my book = 8-10, so easy 3Nt from W|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: partner bids 1nt and you wish you opened 1nt|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: well, best chance to make a stiff king is to open 1nt :)|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: para luego el otro @C sobre K @H|pg||
pc|dT|pc|cT|nt|halila: an unlucky board |pg||
