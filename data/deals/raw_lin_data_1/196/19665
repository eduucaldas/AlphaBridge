mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to David Bird|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|oosb: Hi David|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|runnerup: without ns ' bidding 3nt looks easy ,now some options ,but 3nt still|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers! East has a standard cue-bid response here. His 2NT shows that he is using Lebensohl responses.|pg||
nt|oosb: and West's 3NT is showing an 18+ hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually 2NT distinguishes between a 'bust' response on 0-7 and an 8-10 hand, where you bid a suit instead. |pg||
nt|runnerup: can they go overboard -hardly|pg||
nt|brolucius: But you can follow up a 2NT response with a cue-bid or a 3NT bid, to show various strong hands.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is expected to rebid 3@C on most hands, in case you are weak with clubs.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|runnerup: that was one solution ,but west will pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am with David. I think most os us would respond 3@D with the East cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pick a major|pg||
mb|6N|nt|oosb: Even playing lebensohl i think East's response should be 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: It depends on which of the 4+ versions of Lenesohl you are using. 2NT followed by Lebensohll can be a request for 4-card majors, either showing or denying a diamond stopper.|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6nt was a bit optimistic|pg||
nt|oosb: I think he was planning on 2NT-3@c-3@D showing Majors but no stoper|pg||
nt|oosb: *@d stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 3@D followed by 4NT (West), then East passes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 3NT showed a hand too good for an initial 2NT. On that basis, he is close to a minimum for his sequence and should not have bid over 4NT.|pg||
nt|runnerup: this has no real chance without @s lead and that hardly comes|pg||
nt|brolucius: North should not lead from an honour against 6NT.|pg||
nt|oosb: Tough lead for South (he might think)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North should not lead at all, David|pg||
nt|brolucius: South is on lead. Sorry.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps a heart from South is the safest.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oosb: he might be considering 10@C vs 10@H, I dont think he wants to lead a @D here|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade does not cost, as it happens.|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes @s lead /south ok -i was one in boat thinking north is  leading|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A club could have been right in case they need to set up a club trick before @DA is knocked out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It would not have been good here, though|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can see 10 easy tricks for starters:  3 spades, 3 hearts, two clubs and two diamonds.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oosb: Case can be made for a @C lead (I'm leaning towards it)|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W made no move towards looiking for an 8-card major fit, so they are likely to be well equipped in clubs.|pg||
nt|oosb: it's a pushy auction for sure, so theres a very good chance pd pops with J,K or A@C and why shouldnt he|pg||
nt|runnerup: small @d twice is wise|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oosb: if its the latter 2, jackpot, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: So here is a topic for your book after next, David. Leads against slams|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I don't think we have too many on that subject|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have just written a book that contains a section on leading against 6NT and leading from Q-10-9-5-2 is not among its recommendations.|pg||

nt|runnerup: 4 @s looks good save,but they never had chance to bid that suit and 5 @d is on also|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the 8 is a reverse-count signal (from 3), South knows that the K will drop. (Not that it will help him with the diamonds running).|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|oosb: This one isnt as straight forward as it seems. East counted North's points well in board 1, when he dropped a doubleton Q offside, but if he reads too deeply into the overcall he ...|pg||

mc|6|nt|oosb: good point|pg||
nt|runnerup: no saves needed because no finesses done -it migth help sometimes |pg||
nt|oosb: was very risky, specially considering the 2NT bid on top of the overcall, A@H was not guaranteed|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have no idea why declarer played diamonds from the top. North's overcall did not turn the odds in favour of finding him with a singleton @DK.|pg||

mb|3S|nt|oosb: 6@c much much better as Roland pointed out|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H seems to be Kokish, showing hearts or a normal 3NT rebid.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2D|nt|runnerup: 4+ 13 -and ew has this game-but perhaps they bid nothing|pg||
nt|runnerup: now have they agreement @d for east also |pg||
nt|brolucius: And if it goes 1@D - 1@H - 2@D, West is stuck. To go to 3@C now will give the wrong impressionof the relative lengths of his suits. It will also carry the bidding much higher than ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S - 2@C - 2@D - 2@H. Nothing going for it at all.  |pg||

nt|runnerup: can he avoid @d lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: Matsuda said 2@D  "or natural o micheals" , I have no idea|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing 2@D (and 2@C) as natural on this sort of auction is the best idea. You have plenty of other actions when you hold the majors.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The same when they bid any two suits at the one-level.|pg||
