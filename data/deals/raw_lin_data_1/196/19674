mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzmw: ONE MINOR OR BOTH MAJORS|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: NED RUM took a sizeable lead after being 16 down in the first set|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzmw: rdl points|pg||
nt|minimeck: a normal modern 1nt here, xx by wackwitz values here|pg||
nt|gulyas: this the 2nd of 3 sets|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|gulyas: again, 1@D is walsh, meaning he has no major unless 10+|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: dbl to|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: take out|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome back everyone :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|minimeck: good morning also to Giulio @h, has done a great job so far!, we are in very good hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: ty|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|rensph: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: ARG URU managed to pull 7 imps back in the last segment, still a very close match here |pg||
nt|minimeck: hello Rens|pg||
mb|3H|nt|minimeck: Rodrigo will need to lead diamonds to set 3nt here, should be no problem holding the ace of clubs |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: he will know with 100% certainty that NS have a long club suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would have liked that 1@H being played out...|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: knowing they do not have a heart fit and his partner has the long spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: normal 1nt by north here, double is purely takeout :) if he had the guts, could have got 300 in 1h |pg||
nt|gulyas: he would have deserved that for overcalling with that junk|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|minimeck: East decides to make a game try here, a foul lie here even 2@h might go down|pg||
nt|minimeck: same contract other room|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|rensph: I'd seriously consider opening 1NT as E here|pg||
nt|rensph: this is a pretty bad hand for it but usually it works out with 15-17 bal|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gulyas: or 500 maybe|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|minimeck: i disagree there, a 100% overcall, |pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, alot of players have shifted to the philosophy of opening all 5-3-3-2 distributions in the point range 1nt|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|minimeck: I believe rodwell when he says its by far the winning % bid |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|minimeck: but a flat board will be the outcome :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: I would never ever overcall with that, only gets you into trouble, either directly or indirectly (by revealing where the points/distribution is)|pg||
nt|gulyas: a pile of jacks, wk suit (come on, opps take 3! tricks in that suit against you in NT)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: in junior bridge is mandatory|pg||
nt|gulyas: I know that juniors like to bid:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: that still makes it a bad call|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|minimeck: Argentina have shown they do not open 1nt very, often however, 3 or 4 hands where they didn't open 1nt even with 4M and 5 M -2-2|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5 (card minor)|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be a push here to start things out|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|gulyas: we used to preempt like crazy when we were juniors - we were always happy when we did not get x-ed:) its was the 'oops, they did not take their 1100 again' feeling:)|pg||

nt|minimeck: a flat 3nt here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: good slam bid and made by ARG in the OR|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|minimeck: spectator proposes east could have doubled 3nt, almost being sure that he will have five tricks, seems he was content with a plus score here |pg||
nt|minimeck: NS can also make 4@c |pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see how the Dutch handle it here|pg||
nt|rensph: It can be difficult to stay calm and focused when you know you're behind 20-30 imps, but usually there's no reason to force any swings if you manage to bid and make your game ...|pg||
nt|rensph: contracts.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: strange x with 5c@H suit, but at least he can offer all other suits as well, not as bad as it looks|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S bids 3@S now, they will end up in 4@S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|minimeck: first blood to the south americans here, some neat tools here for Ned, does anyone know what 1nt is here?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzmw: 1 nt = 5+ clubs and 4th ajor|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: major|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: thank you, Raptor 1nt , :) interesting choice with 7-4|pg||
nt|Walddk5:  for those who want to watch more than one room:  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile|pg||
nt|minimeck: I cannot imagine Wackwitz will sit for this, but he will have a tough time catching up here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Daniel Gulyas|pg||
nt|gulyas: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|minimeck: good morning Daniel :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|gulyas: this certainly sounds like a pen dbl, but S has no trumps to lead, and has a 7carder in @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: in any case, if rodrigo's auto-6@s on the previous set was a predictor, a good save available |pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gulyas: this will be beaten 1 or 2 tricks, but NS has game|pg||
nt|minimeck: Clearly he was not happy with this quandary, but he had no clear way forward|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3NT and 5@C both makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: hm, N did not think his black holdings are enough for slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: decides to take the plus, a very good start for ARG URU as NS have arrived in 3nt|pg||
nt|minimeck: might be able to get out for 100 here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|minimeck: very simmilar in many sports such as soccer, even a goal down in the second half, you don't sell out and send everyone forward until about 20 or so minutes left, if you give ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: anything more up, you're dead, :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: can score 5s, 3h, 2d and a club here|pg||
nt|minimeck: but might duck a diamond|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|gulyas: and his red holdings looked to be dubious opposite at least one short red suit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe, will have a hard time dealing with the 4 trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has to get @Ds right (which should not be too difficult|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|gulyas: wrong ace led, so 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|c2|nt|gulyas: but 12 imp back to the trailing ARG URU|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|minimeck: with 7/4 might have been better here for Wackwitz to simply overcall 2@c, the raptor nt overcall created more of a problem for NS than EW|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting line here by wackwitz|pg||

nt|bebechira: he had no risk play for 11..probably loose 1 imp|pg||
nt|bebechira: action here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|oosb: Clearly has to avoid 6@H, but the question is, if they stop in 5 does that make|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bebechira: nice stop...and some more coffee|pg||
nt|oosb: but even without @D, @S 4-3 means it should be a problem and can draw all 3@H.|pg||
nt|ferlema: la voz de 3@H es forcing game|pg||
nt|oosb: Argentina dont want coffee hands!|pg||
nt|ferlema: buena revaluacion del semifallo de Espadas por parte de Norte|pg||
nt|oosb: This will take Max all of 1 minute to play|pg||
nt|bebechira: true... but many boards to go... 25 imps = 2 swing boards|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||

nt|gulyas: cutting the deficit to 20|pg||
nt|minimeck: fans rooting for action, the last set usually full of fireworks, we will have to wait a bit :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: a partscore battle here, NS can make abt 2-3@Cs, EW is good until abt 3@S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|minimeck: double or 1@h both options here on the east hand, with the quality of the heart suit and poor spades, chooses 1@h here|pg||
nt|rensph: looks like a matter of overtricks in 4@H here|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|gulyas: but the 1@H overcall (which is normal) leaves no way to find @Ss on a safe level|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless it goes 1NT-p-2@C now|pg||
nt|gulyas: then he can dbl for t/o|pg||
mb|3C|nt|minimeck: note wackwitz only bids 1nt, Bob is extremely well known for some light bids, and he is 3rd seat favorable :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|gulyas: he has 7 tricks from top, maybe able to get another trick by an endplay|pg||
nt|rensph: 2NT forcing a 3@C bid from partner, after which S will show a GF 5-5|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|minimeck: will likely lead the A@d |pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 4 clubs support hearts|pg||
nt|minimeck: seeing dummy should cashout, we shall see :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|minimeck: strip endplay also available in 3@c , and scanavino has found it, will be a push or an imp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rensph: 4@C not necessarily showing a club cue, just setting trumps and giving partner the room to bid 4@D, which doesn't promise a cue either but a good hand for the bidding so far|pg||

nt|minimeck: Crusizio and Garcia Da Rosa meanwhile are much more "meckwellian" in there approach, i think they have chosen well to play this pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|play4fun55:  4 h is a likely contract|pg||
nt|minimeck: another action hand here, NS can make 5@d, after a likely 1nt opener will they find it|pg||
mb|d!|nt|rensph: X shows 5m 4M|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|minimeck: and another telephone number for Agica Nistor in the other room! now in 2@h x|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: although perhaps i spoke too soon :), yet again a non-1nt opener|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d!|nt|gulyas: this time a 25-point 3NT is a maker|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: W trying for game now, seeing the big fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: same spot here, should be 800 here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: E should bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: very strange bidding here, :) i imagine now maxi will bid 3nt shoulder shruggingly|pg||
nt|gulyas: showing his pattern to give pd the chance to look out for the red suits|pg||
nt|minimeck: might be able to establish a long club|pg||
nt|minimeck: that lead helps certainly|pg||
nt|minimeck: in practice 800 not realistic, :x defense has to give something up|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|vugraphzmw: garica didn't alerted 3 spades wathever it means|pg||
nt|rensph: Other room played by W, leading a small diamond|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|minimeck: getting too fancy here,|pg||
pc|c2|nt|minimeck: might have needed to duck there for tempo|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|minimeck: the important thing to note here, when you decide not to open 1nt it is impossible to show "15-17" balanced :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: really, both should have bid 3NT at some point:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: still strange for him not to bid 3nt over 2@s|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|gulyas: once again the suits are not too friendly|pg||
nt|minimeck: but south endplayed now|pg||
nt|minimeck: must find a diamond shift to get the spade through|pg||
nt|rensph: @DA @DJ now?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|rensph: Had north held any spade values he would've played his small clubs the other way around|pg||
nt|minimeck: south in the same pickle as before, he should have seen this coming and possibly shifted to a diamond earlier, |pg||
nt|minimeck: he still has to guess, however|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: the lead blows a trick for the defense, but its only an overtrick|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  a ruffing finessin clubs  against west should see south home though|pg||
nt|gulyas: taking the ruffing finesse in @Cs works, as the 9 is dropping|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|minimeck: a white game for the NED rum and a likely 7 imps|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|gulyas: losing a @D and a @S, making 5, and losing 6imps in the process|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  no other sensible line for South to follow either|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  would have been better to winn the last h in hand and take the ruffing finess directly, now South might be in trouble|pg||
pc|s7|nt|minimeck: correct, 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: so NED RUM on the board now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzmw: south calls td|pg||
nt|gulyas: I imagine some rapid Spanish under the screen now:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: can't imagine what for, a good board for him|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: complain for spade lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am sure if he knew they were 4-3 in @Ss, he would have led sg else|pg||
nt|minimeck: so perhaps the overtrick at issue|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, and it also counts as an IMP, 270=7|pg||
nt|minimeck: Rodrigo and maxi are pretty calm, they aren't like the famous italians :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: to garcia 3 spade was almost natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: he supported|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, I like to steal some phrases from the late mr Anderson:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: td change the score, just made|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: of course he doesn't know that all his @Cs are high|pg||
nt|minimeck: North will be forced to give up a trump trick here|pg||
nt|minimeck: will only get two more|pg||
nt|minimeck: a fine defense compounded by poor declarer play in the open room and the likely unlikely 800 is achieved by Da rosa :)|pg||

nt|ferlema: mala subasta que llevo a un mal carteo|pg||

nt|oosb: only loses to this layout|pg||
nt|bebechira: the dutch boys were less adventuros and they are in 2s|pg||
nt|oosb: 5 imps back to NED RUM |pg||
nt|oosb: Nistor must be relieved, he mustve thought @D lead might have given away the contract|pg||
nt|vivienne: forbbiden to touch the @H|pg||
nt|oosb: good point teddy, East has to stay away from @H or declarer can make|pg||
nt|bebechira: cash the spade ace and diamond...let the declarer work may be|pg||
nt|bebechira: small club interesting as well|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vivienne: the 4of @c discared by part gives him problems|pg||

nt|bebechira: he has to after the tank|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: wooow|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, so the right score is 16-7|pg||
nt|minimeck: did west alert 3@s giulio?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: yes he did it|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  always easier to play seaing all 4 hands Daniel :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so another 12 to ARG, cutting the deficit yet again, to 12|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree:)|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  even I make an occational contract then|pg||
nt|minimeck: another swing hand here, 4s might make with some good guesswork or defensive help|pg||
nt|rensph: lots of things to do though.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|gulyas: there had to be a misunderstanding, otherwise they would have played 3NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gulyas: as specs point it out, all other declarers in the semis made it, so maybe it was not me only who thought he could have done better:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, in practice will likely go down, Nistor has underlead his king of diamonds, that will help in the open|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|minimeck: ok, maxi took 3@s as something artificial, so wackwitz entitled to the trick as a result of the false alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but it was a very light alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: not a big one|pg||
nt|gulyas: is there such a thing?:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: is a tough lead problem, however|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like small club lead is a winner :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: that would be quite impressive indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I only alerted a little, don't take it to heart:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: when they think some questions should be asked they strong alert|pg||
nt|gulyas: pass? are you sure?|pg||
nt|minimeck: not possible|pg||
nt|gulyas: back to WW, this time trying his hand at 1NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|minimeck: too much work for Rodrigo, wackwitz amazingly does not raise here|pg||
nt|minimeck: will win a swing back for NED|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south seems to have downgraded his @dQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gulyas: W hoping that his pd will return his suit so he can run it... not to be, tho|pg||
pc|d4|nt|minimeck: 2nt a 4 card heart raise|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: sry...|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, better now - 2nt had to be a @H raise|pg||
nt|rensph: Still, I'd be tempted to raise.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gulyas: ok, so @D lead and a push|pg||
pc|d6|nt|play4fun55:  a h return would make it harder for South. Now he should be able to set up and access the clubs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|minimeck: a very common treatment to play 2nt in these situations as such, what some people may normally play over a double|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|minimeck: raise seems normalish* but decided to take a position 4333 and as you say qd doesn't look apetizing|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|sT|pc|d3|pg||

nt|MolvaM: doesnt worry too much about the trumps at this contract|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: at 4@s though, the lead might give declarer a clue|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|minimeck: alejandro dutifully underleads his club now looking at dummy :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: S not happy to hear that xfer|pg||
nt|minimeck: in most cases, these transfers are not "manditory" as with an NT opener, south is free to bid his hand w/o tolerance|pg||
nt|rensph: 5@C down on 3 roudns of @H?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Ned Juniors lead france by 8 imps|pg||

pc|h2|nt|gulyas: now that declarer knows @Hs are not favourable, he will play on @Ds|pg||

nt|gulyas: it maybe OK in 1NT, but not in 3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|minimeck: declarer can take them all now if he wishes, after taking 6 clubs his heart and 2 spades, can either hook the diamond |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|minimeck: or just go AK and hope for the q to drop|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|minimeck: agreed, that is likely his best shot|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|gulyas: there was really no need to jump to 3nt, he could have started with 2@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: interestingly, this is at least the 3rd (if not 4th) hand in this semis where you should play 5 of a minor instead of 3nt despite stoppers in all suits|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you call Q vs 987xx a stopper, that is...|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: well east claimed and now td is at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: one or two off|pg||
nt|gulyas: he claimed 1 off? that should be ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: cliamed made, that's the problem|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can drive out the @CA and thats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: most probably he forgot club ace|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, thats a problem:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: its an obv -1, so it should not be too hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: north says he could loose a diamond if esat has forget the ace club|pg||

nt|minimeck: hard to blame him for that, although with east being marked AKQ of @h, certainly an option to finese :p|pg||
nt|rensph: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: another 6 for NED RUM, closing the gap|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: i think west should have passed 3@c there, if he more carefully considered the context clues of the auction, his p could not raise spades, nor double 2@d, and north made a transfer ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: to hearts|pg||
mb|1C|nt|minimeck: but knowing east was entitled to three tricks anyway, he was content |pg||
mb|1S|nt|MolvaM: in anycase he did have a complete count for the 12th|pg||
nt|MolvaM: last 3 cards of east were @hAKQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he could have exited with a diamond|pg||
mb|2S|nt|minimeck: just two trump losers here in 5@d|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS would make 3NT if @Cs ran|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: right, 5@D makes, just has to find it how to get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 clubs multi meanings|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt now from scanavino|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gulyas: they have 6-4@Ds but nobody mentioned the suit yet|pg||
nt|minimeck: wackwitz has bypassed 1@d here, he still has time for 3@d now, garcia applies max pressure|pg||
nt|minimeck: so not an option, a tough bid now|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: ok, maybe was an other name and I'm confused vith Vikor|pg||
nt|gulyas: with pretty much everything right here, every game makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he plays with Pauncz occasionally|pg||
nt|gulyas: or anybody else that pays him:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: ten yaers I direct in Venice tournament|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: one heart alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: 9 of diamonds lead?|pg||
nt|minimeck: two more for Uruguay as Rodrigo had his radar on in 3nt on the low heart lead, well done |pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzmw: so I know many interantional players|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, Venice, the Venice of...um, Italy?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: y|pg||
nt|minimeck: wackwitz has a toughish lead here, spade might be right if they only have two stoppers|pg||
nt|minimeck: but goes with the passive diamond :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north's pass of 2@s probably showed no high honors|pg||
pc|d4|nt|minimeck: this contract will not fetch, perhaps unlucky on the club split, but 5@d superior, another win for old school bidding, Ferro has arrived in 5d|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 3NT it is, and with the @C suit not breaking, it only has 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and east was probably looking very confident of himself at the table :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: things very friendly here, clubs split, ace of hearts doubleton|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gulyas: spec suggests 2@D by N, but you really need more for that|pg||
nt|gulyas: just kidding|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|minimeck: will want to keep south on lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: overtaking @cQ loses a trick|pg||
nt|minimeck: should tuck here|pg||
nt|minimeck: duck*|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so north is helploess here|pg||
nt|minimeck: if north has KQ7x there is a second loser anyway|pg||

mb|2C|nt|minimeck: halfway done and 10 imps between the teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: another 3nt here for NS|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west is lucky that he is not the dealer here|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|minimeck: on a diamond lead will be a bit interesting|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a weak 2@h opening could go for a number|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|gulyas: Lebensohl in action here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|gulyas: specs say with the walsh convention you have to start with 1@H response on the S hand, but I disagree|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree Daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: walsh states you have to have GF with 44, and inv+ with 54|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the S hand qualifies for a 1@D easily|pg||
nt|gulyas: Leb-slow as opposed to Leb-fast in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: later I'll do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: EW will have to keep there composure here, after giving away two game swings|pg||
nt|gulyas: in the OR they did start with 1@C-1@D-2@D, and they were never in doubt abt the right contract|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS got lucky with the bad discard|pg||
nt|minimeck: they right sided the contract here :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: ty:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: td comes back with 3nt one off|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: good call|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2@d and 3@c here show?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gulyas: so instead of 10 out, its 2 in for NED RUM, down by 1 only|pg||
nt|minimeck: kib points out 9 top tricks even on a diamond lead from east, don't need clubs :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2d looked for a 3-card @h support probably?|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3@s 3@c 2@d 1@h|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|gulyas: can he scramble an overtrick? either @Hs, or @S offer a chance to take one more|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, the opps have @HAK and @DA, so only of he sneaks a @H thru can he make 10|pg||
nt|gulyas: but this is no pairs tournament|pg||
nt|gulyas: he needs 9, so he will play for 9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: another 3NT not making, while 5@D would have...|pg||
nt|minimeck: for those interested, NED juniors up early against france, very possible we might see an all NED finals (+ 1 US / 1 Romanian) , that would be exciting|pg||
nt|gulyas: and when S gets in with his @HAK, he will have the 4th@C to cash to keep it at 9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|minimeck: Nistor raised to all of 2@d on his 16 count with 5 card support, so they have landed in only 2 in the other room|pg||

nt|oosb: infact Arg can go ahead by 1imp|pg||
nt|vivienne: @S back cannt be good|pg||
nt|oosb: he should finesse @H before ruffing @D to retain @C option incase @H finesse off|pg||
nt|oosb: that is if Q@S entry is not knocked out|pg||

nt|minimeck: a possible swing board here, a thin 3nt is ice cold on this layout |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|minimeck: has been a very apparent stylistic difference between the two teams here, good for the spectators to see :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|minimeck: once again the 4 card raise w/ 2nt|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|minimeck: what does north bid here at this point|pg||
nt|rensph: 2NT?|pg||
nt|minimeck: and AR URU are on there way to game|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2nt a possibility, nothing perfect he has a decent overcall but nothing that extra|pg||
nt|minimeck: he knows they don't have the HCP for game|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: now will it go 3@S-4@S or 3NT-pass?|pg||
nt|gulyas: or maybe 3@S pass?:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: its hard to imagine a worse 11 count now|pg||

nt|gulyas: if this 3@S is not forcing, I want to pass:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: a very sensible pass|pg||
nt|rensph: the double diamond stopper might be enough to set up partner's clubs though|pg||
nt|minimeck: and AR URU have bid 4@h !!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|minimeck: a good save available in 5@d, only 500|pg||
nt|gulyas: if it goes @D, @D ruff, would't you underlead your @CAKQ to try to get another ruff?:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 5@c|pg||
nt|minimeck: we will see if they do make it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|minimeck: on a spade lead should be a simple matter discovering the position immediately|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gulyas: so I expect an overtrick:)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|minimeck: I would imagine so :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess he did not want to look too stupid by missing a vul game, so he bid one more for the road |pg||
nt|gulyas: so, is this forcing for everyone? acolers?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: my impression is that he did it so|pg||
nt|rensph: given the spade layout you'll probably end up making 4@H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|gulyas: if 3@D can be this weak, then 3@S should be passable|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|gulyas: (beat Lauria-Versace 800 with that, but who remembers that:) )|pg||
nt|minimeck: credit the southamericans perserverance, they hung with it even after a 48-0(ish) stretch in the first quarter|pg||
nt|rensph: they'll be leading by 1 imp after this board|pg||
nt|minimeck: and another action hand, a near 2 loser hand in south, but off two aces, should be able to stop after some RKC|pg||
mb|3C|nt|minimeck: :) at least one person does|pg||
nt|gulyas: yep:)|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|gulyas: they did take the 5@C sacrifice in the OR on bd26, so yet another 4 to NED RUM|pg||

nt|minimeck: but should be fine|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|minimeck: he will have to find the jack|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|gulyas: not a good fit this time, with AKQ opposite singleton|pg||
nt|gulyas: so game is out of the Q, can he get 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|gulyas: if they duck this, he can win, discard 2 @Cs on the @Hs|pg||
nt|gulyas: then he will get the @Ds right obviously, but can he guess trumps too?|pg||
nt|gulyas: its normal to play @SA-@S from hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: S may also play @DA, small @C, but thats not likely|pg||
nt|minimeck: some danger now|pg||
nt|minimeck: any one know for sure how they play 5@h here? |pg||
mb|5N!|nt|gulyas: he will need to give up some tricks in the meantime, can he manage all that? lets see|pg||
nt|minimeck: he can survive two taps|pg||
nt|gulyas: its possible, take this, cash @HAK, lead a @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: taken, @HJ cashed, first tap|pg||
nt|gulyas: play a @D to the Q and A|pg||
nt|gulyas: second tap, and cross to dummy with the @Cs to take the finesse|pg||
nt|minimeck: that would work here, can go either way in diamonds, however :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|minimeck: he might simply hook east for the jack|pg||
nt|gulyas: but the wk jump makes W favourite to hold @D length|pg||
nt|minimeck: scanavino passes with the north hand, so more imps on the line|pg||
nt|gulyas: especially once E shows up with 6-3 in the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: wow|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to blame either side here|pg||
nt|rensph: 5NT asking keycards|pg||
mb|6D|nt|minimeck: too late to ask for keys|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: they'll soon find out they're one too high already|pg||
nt|minimeck: east should double 6@d here|pg||
mb|6H|nt|gulyas: when he tries @Cs, he will see that he also had 2@Cs, so he is most likely 6322|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: but ferro will lead a minor for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: i predict he will lead the club|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, so 5 back to the leaders|pg||
nt|minimeck: i'm sure this board will be much discussed by all parties involved, i think both players actions here reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: so, ARG URU started the match well, but have a 34-0 against their 16-0, so down 18 already|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|minimeck: but bypassing keycard to cue bid or (invite) slam always has that risk|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5 more bds to go, lets see what they can make out of it|pg||
nt|minimeck: the imps have been well deserved, they will have to stop the bleeding pretty quickly|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is 2 down only, while NS can even make slam with the lucky @H lie|pg||
nt|minimeck: these auctions are some of the toughest to handle, |pg||
nt|gulyas: nice 3nt made in the OR|pg||
mb|2D|nt|minimeck: most people play x here as "penalty-ish" but is more of an optional double|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: bob goes "all in with 5nt pick a slam"|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|minimeck: and garcia insta-saves, he trusts his opps|pg||
nt|minimeck: ferro lying in the weeds here|pg||
nt|minimeck: will balance for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|gulyas: he does have a useful 13 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: all right, spec points out that @D lead beats 6@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the @H interiors falling, it should be easy sailng|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: wow, garcia has gone down in 4@h, |pg||
nt|minimeck: that will prove quite costly|pg||
nt|rensph: didn't play for the @H finesse, it seems|pg||
nt|minimeck: he didn't actually need the heart finese on his line|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: E went for the insurance tho with 6@S, only going 800|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gulyas: the way @Ss are, @S lead would have made life more difficult|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he still would have gotten home with 4@H-3@C-2 aces|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he needed to guess which finesse to take for that|pg||
nt|minimeck: thought for waaaay to long and put himself in the deep freeze, made a no play play|pg||
pc|dK|nt|minimeck: just had to cash the club|pg||
nt|rensph: trying to cash the @ST couldn't really win|pg||

nt|minimeck: a sigh of releif for their fans|pg||
pc|d2|nt|minimeck: i am somewhat suprised by the auto save holding AQ of @h, saving on these auctions when opps have basically "guessed" to jump to slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: is a gamble|pg||

nt|minimeck: NS had trouble sorting out the NS hand and ended up in 5@c|pg||
nt|minimeck: so a huge swing to Ned|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, I stand corrected: neither slam makes, so this may end up expensive|pg||
nt|minimeck: someone should drop a hint to the kibs in the other match :), we could decide this on the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: 48 unanswered now and this will prove to be a tall order for Arg uru|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|minimeck: as we have seen thus far, the southamericans have favored a more conservative approach|pg||
nt|minimeck: they will have to change gears to try and mount a comeback|pg||
nt|gulyas: N will try for game, and S will not accept|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the favourable @C lie, 3@H makes|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|gulyas: N goes: what on earth did we agree on after 1M-2M?:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: strange enough, ARG missed this game at the other table, with 13-13HCP|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe 3@D was intended as forcing|pg||
nt|minimeck: despite a string of plus scores, north south will likely be feeling some concern, |pg||
nt|minimeck: looks like a bit too much for 4@h to fetch here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gulyas: on a @S lead 3NT is down tho|pg||
nt|minimeck: surely wackwitz will pick hearts here|pg||
nt|minimeck: but they will not go, i suspect east will compete|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gulyas: oh, ok, short suit game tries, I remember:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: i can assure you they know their system :p|pg||
nt|gulyas: just trying to make a little joke here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: as it is, no game is making, I can see that:) but could you always tell that and stop from 2 obv opening hands, and a decent fit?|pg||
nt|rensph: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: big bid by bob here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rensph: N probably had a different picture of partner's hand in mind|pg||
nt|minimeck: although wackwitz doesn't have the typical takeout x, he has a right to expect a bit more|pg||
nt|minimeck: spectators tell me 2h promises 4 here, south regretting his initial double decided to try and get out as low as possible|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|minimeck: we gotchya, sometimes hard to read the tone (textually) just clarifying|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|gulyas: both @S honors offside and also the @CK off, 3NT is down on a @S lead, and 5@D also has 3 tricks to lose|pg||
nt|minimeck: south is quite a fine experienced player, this double to me shows that he is pressing|pg||
nt|rensph: it doesn't really promise 4, you just bid your longest major so very few occasions on which you don't have a 4crd in the suit you bid.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|minimeck: vul with 3/3 in the majors no shortness, no nothing really|pg||

nt|gulyas: ok, one more imp for NED RUM|pg||

nt|minimeck: in the previous championship, Bob Drivjer lost a heartbreaking semifinal match to Japan Czech(the eventual winners) and lost the bronze medal playoff to yours truly and USA 1, it ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be bitter to swallow if it happens again|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: pressure on Agica and Nistor to bid the grand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|minimeck: this allowed declarer to draw two rounds of trump and pitch 4 spades on the clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow, so 6@D made|pg||
nt|gulyas: 11 badly needed imps for ARG URU|pg||
nt|minimeck: and Agica throws argentina uruguay a much needed lifelien|pg||
nt|minimeck: Leads against slams are never clear, k@h seemed safe for west|pg||
nt|minimeck: a tough ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: but oftentimes you need to cash the ace, holding a singleton trump, was a huge risk|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rensph: I remember that. Lost the semi final by 1 imp.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|gulyas: 2@H a xfer obv|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S a safe spot|pg||
nt|minimeck: semi forcing 1nt here for EW|pg||
nt|minimeck: 9 tricks if you guess the diamond|pg||
pc|cA|nt|minimeck: presumably invitational values of some sort|pg||
nt|gulyas: this should end up with 8 or 9 tricks, depending on the @H guess|pg||
nt|minimeck: can afford to take the double finese in hearts with one of his entries if he chooses|pg||
nt|minimeck: i predict 9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gulyas: he could, but without drawing trumps thats a risk if @Hs are 4-2|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H makes too|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless...|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|minimeck: with no clear entries, takes the finese :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer will obv get the trumps right, but when he gives up the 3rd round, W pushes a @C thru and gets a @D ruff |pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile agica has invited w/ 3@s after a forcing 1nt, and east as signed off in game|pg||
nt|rensph: other table in 4@S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|minimeck: 14 for ARG uru and ned are on life support|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|minimeck: will need a double digit swing on the last board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: now THAT may be trouble|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||

nt|oosb: Ofcourse not with the 5-0 break, im just saying wouldnt you want to be in 6@H?|pg||
nt|minimeck: appreciate the numerous spectator comments about Messi for barca, a good point however, that even these bridge matches are not played on paper, many people considered Arg Uru a big ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: underdog, but they have not played like it|pg||
nt|ferlema: es dificil ganar 4|pg||
nt|oosb: Its on a @H finesse|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oosb: and I guess you'll then need @S 4-1 or better too |pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|veistikke:  can always get north endplayed inn @h here to make 11|pg||
nt|minimeck: the players here will not know this board is meaningless, we might be here a while|pg||

nt|runnerup: sing|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: W|pg||
nt|minimeck: highly doubtful, just waiting to input the bids together|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: probably not. south and west are on the same side of the table screen|pg||

nt|gulyas: especially not x-ed:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: bd 31 a push|pg||
nt|minimeck: this will drift one or two off, a good result, hard to double it with either hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he tries for the @CJ finesse, he may end up 1 down, otherwise its 2@Hs, and 2 black aces for the defense|pg||
nt|minimeck: scanavino quickly passes the hand out in 4@s, in this set, Netherlands have shown that agressive bidding wins more imps than it loses|pg||
