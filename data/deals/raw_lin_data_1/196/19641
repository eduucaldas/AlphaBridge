nt|hedyg: hi Matt, hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: welcome Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: our operator is Giusy, ciao!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: great young stars indeed! the future of American bridge|pg||
mb|1D|nt|minimeck: and an interesting hand to start us of, I believe EW play some sort of strong club variant, is that correct Jenni?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|minimeck: we will see if they still have their relay system in place :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: note the 1@s overcall by Di Franco, must mention the suit but 2@s is suicidal|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: extremely light overcall, even for an Italian|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S now will lead to 7@D|pg||
mb|3N|an|3/0 keycards|mb|p|nt|hedyg: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=894&qroundno=9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to David Bird|pg||
nt|minimeck: Zach Grossack, a fine player himself, has informed me they still play their "terrorist club w/ 14-16 notrumps, short 1@d, and relay precision"|pg||
nt|galois85:  good morning everybody|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers! I see I have joined at an interesting time.|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed you have David, welcome|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi David :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has few losers and should visualize a big diamond contract.|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting options now here for grossack|pg||
nt|minimeck: wonder what their agreement of 4@s would be|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: i would have liked 3@H by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: He need not be worried about the weakish trumps because West has shown support for a suit that might have been quite short.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: is 2@Sgame-forcing with diamonds or just invitational+?|pg||
nt|minimeck: i believe the just play as inv (limit +) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If game-forcing, Grossack could have bid 4@S|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hedyg: 3@H would still have been forcing instead of 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would have doubled initially with 4 hearts, so if East is bidding hearts naturally that is not a good idea. Perhaps 4@S would have been more helpful.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Kaplan might worry now at having shown @s values he does not have|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that Grossack is reluctant to show his void now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so this will end it I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Reaching six is fine. Bidding seven would be beating 'par'.|pg||
nt|minimeck: 4@h is rkc for EW|pg||
nt|gio 89: :) ciao|pg||
nt|minimeck: a push to start us out|pg||
nt|hedyg: well they play short @D and at this vulnerability 1@d could be very weak|pg||
nt|gio 89: sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the player with a void should not ask for keycards|pg||
nt|brolucius: RKCB with a void spade?!|pg||
nt|minimeck: benvenuto @h, welcome giorgia to give us the italian perspective|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO TV|pg||
nt|minimeck: i was told keycard by Grossack's brother, i take his word for gold in this case :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H rkc?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT was a bit cautious, since 5@D should be safe.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|minimeck: amazing in the other match NS bought it for 1@s x (-200 and 15 imps) :) not as flat as it may have seemed|pg||
nt|galois85:  the 2@s of W denies 4 cards in @H?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Should do.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: should do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with 4 hearts you double|pg||

nt|psyck: the preemption seems to have worked other table with some overbidding|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|zebutin: for me 4@H seem little stretched|pg||
nt|psyck: it indeed was|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@S is 8-11|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you in croatia Matt?|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is a junior tournament, so expect alot of fireworks here, both pairs are pretty agressive :|pg||
mb|2S|nt|zebutin: and 4+ cards unbalanced (or 5+ balanced)|pg||
nt|minimeck: today is actually my birthday, 26 now too old :x|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|runnerup: a grand to start |pg||
mb|3D|nt|zebutin: so Koistinen has maximum for their bidding|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Two matches to go and both teams have a good shot to make the cut|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: no players names yet|pg||
mb|4S|nt|minimeck: it's ok, time for our young stars for their chance in the spotlight|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: will play 3@h undoubled here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought you might be close to the "edge" |pg||
mb|4N|nt|zebutin: this most likely goes 3 or so down, so small pickup for Finland|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is pretty much a cake walk for declarer,  not much to say |pg||
nt|minimeck: While this appears to be a flat four hearts, NS in the open room got a bit carried away, are now rotting in 4@s x , which appears to be 5 or 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: balanced 7points (essentially 6 with Jxx in @D) isn't usually something you want to bid 4with against partners t/o double, even though partner does have short @D...|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|minimeck: given we have a nice close nit group here (few kibs so far) feel free to message with questions or comments :)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|wiki: loosing 2 @S @H and @C  or two|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi valerie westheimer :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi Murat|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hopefully we will get the names up soon|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I mean so we can click on them|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: at the other table N bid only 2@D at first, and when partner raised to 3@D found more from pre-emptive hand and bid 4@D...|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have opened 3@d too|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks quite hard decision to defende 1 @d .instead of play some @s or nt -contract|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s no hope here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: No p;ay here|pg||
nt|galois85:  good morning everybody|pg||
nt|runnerup: there was not enougth room to be sure so only 6@d bid|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Grand looks pretty good with these cards.  KC did not really solve the problem W had, though|pg||
nt|santyclz: E never showed his void - that makes the grand unbiddable.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: welcome to peter lund|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|runnerup: ok|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Well he stole 1 trick|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay    just 2 diamonds to lose in 4@H|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|wiki: @H ruff possible|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|psyck: don't particularly like the @h9 play but N had a tough guess on what to play. Declarer should have probably started @c after winning @hK|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C suit has some chances for defence too... if S ducks couple times with A, might be enough to make Jansons finese @C 10|pg||

nt|brolucius: Five diamonds, four hearts and three clubs gives you 12. Add 1 spade ruff in the short hand and you have 13.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, I only know O-zone|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|minimeck: for those USA 1 fans out there, 7@d = 1440 was a push vs. croatia :) fine bridge indeed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Yes, excellent bidding!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Danger if they get to the 5-level|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is common to play 3@S as pre-emptive and to use bids such as 2NT, 3 @C and 3@D to show types of spade raise.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Even 4@S can go down|pg||

nt|minimeck: welcome Traian|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: id call that lucky 4 hearts|pg||
nt|galois85:  clearly flags are inverted here|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: @c lead needed here ( from KJ( to beat 4 @s maybe |pg||
mb|1C|an|strong|nt|zebutin: 1@C is 15-17nt or 12-16 unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  1@c is strong (both pairs for the US are playing a precision style)|pg||
nt|runnerup: game fails with natural @h lead here|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: indeed, :) needed the trump suit to cooperate there. they will take it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be this will end in 1 spade|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|psyck: both tables chose 1N to 2@c overcall|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9: Hi Markkhu|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt on a @s lead here appears doomed|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Edgettons in the open room are superstars in our part of the world...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|zebutin: usually not 6th club in 1nt, but tells strength quite closely, and shape not too much off...|pg||
nt|minimeck: appears they failed to find the club shift on board 21 so first blood to the americans|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|wiki: EW is bidding very differently in open and closed as close open all 8 or more|pg||
nt|zebutin: not even singelton or two|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both ok |pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, will be interesting to see if east raises to 2|pg||
nt|minimeck: do EW play a strong club variant of some sort (with limited openings)?|pg||
nt|ady: with clubs 3-3  3NT easy for e/w|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is pretty minimal for his 1@c bid, maybe they can stay out of game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Koistinen knows that 16 is max for Nyberg... but must have something good for jump to 3@H in zone|pg||
nt|bebechira: Nabil will play in Veldhoven in the open team... the youngest ever :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|minimeck: an interesting trend in junior qualifiers recently, going to 10 board round robin / swiss matches, very few boards with a world championship on the line, :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: hi Andre'|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They seem to be getting too hugh here|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They can bail out at 4@c & make that|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to stop with 16 opp 8|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: True|pg||
nt|minimeck: and a practical 2@c bid here by lankveld, will find a very nice place to play |pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: No, but probably 1@s is limited|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: 1@d is better minor|pg||
nt|minimeck: grazie mille Fabio @h we are in good hands with our operator this morning|pg||
mb|4D|nt|zebutin: so well bid on both rooms, might be imp difference for either way, if declarer just takes 6@C+@H+@D+@S|pg||
nt|ady: east will have to give preference to spades  but then west should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3nt cold but, difficult stop on 3nt with 5-5 M|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: or if defender tosses 1 diamond away, declarer fineses and takes 6@C, @S, @H , 3@D|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this 12 board semifinal will play one of the Finnish teams in the 12 board Finals to follow after this.|pg||
nt|zebutin: or declarer can double finese in @D, but I honestly don't see that happening...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he lead kindly but still should fail|pg||
nt|bebechira: not a lot of room to "recover"  if you make a mistake :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: :) I hope for you :)|pg||
nt|ady: only preference bid for spades   and with a moderate suit west should bid 3NT    east can always convert to spades with a better holding|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: But if they get to game (in clubs) probably the heart lead has been pin pointed now.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: A lot of work to do here, in 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: hard gamble by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: This might help|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i must admit i had passed out 1 spade|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s is about 50% -so should be didden,because without @h lead it has extra chance -like jxx in @d like it is|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ianmcc: pls change names - these are last tim's|pg||
pc|h5|nt|exerdar: hearts 3-3 this good news for declerar|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play well to make this|pg||
nt|exerdar: if just gives 3 spades ,he can do it|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|zebutin: after opponents have bid @D as their suit, Nyberg might have void in that, so @D A isnt pulling all the weight it could be...so disciplined pass|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @S return still 3 tricks coming for defence, which would be 7 imps for finland|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will have 10 rounds of Swiss... and then QF,SF and F|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|minimeck: indeed, Maximo really decided to simply deny them the contract with the balancing 1nt here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but 3 clubs is a very nice spot|pg||
nt|minimeck: certainly a stretch but that is their overall style of bidding|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: cash 2 spades and crossruff 6 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|minimeck: QF and SF 3 16 board segments, with a final of 4 14 board segments and (3rd place playoff of 3 segemnts) at least they went to all day matches for the semis and quarterfinals|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|pelu: didn't N see the bidding - on their way to 3Nt buit no @H-stop|pg||

nt|hedyg: CR result looks like a misclaim though|pg||
nt|hedyg: even on the @d lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: slam for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    e/w can make 9 tricks in hearts  |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: this table playing much faster than other table, they have almost taken the 2 deal lead up, so soon no comparisons from this table...|pg||

nt|minimeck: they open very light, i would imagine Garcia da rosa not liking his options here, i predict a shoulder shrugging pass|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 12 imps is alot for winning 3 clubs...|pg||
nt|minimeck: not the best discarding by ferro, came down to K10 of diamonds allowed them to run both suits|pg||

nt|minimeck: do they also have the rule here regarding semifinals and two teams from the same country (as with the bermuda bowl and USA1/2)?|pg||
nt|bebechira: good point , lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably|pg||
nt|minimeck: will hit the jackpot, however, with p's double heart stopper, to me personally the risk seems far greater than the reward|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: sooner or later we will have one big board which will decide the match :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: this has chance to make ,but probably fales -ew can make 110 in @s but not easy to come in|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bebechira: i will give a link with a teriffic youtube video made by Maz ( east here)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S would show this type of hand   but west heart suit poor  when going to at least the 3 level|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|wiki: Linden is  now very conservative / not bidding 2 @D|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: inverted minor, can have a major|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: In 6@C declarer needs to discard a spade on the @DK-J and might try a very early lead of the @D2, to put East under pressure when he holds the @DA and not the @DQ.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anything around 50% is excellent in my terminology|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|minimeck: that makes anything below 50 "almost excelent " for you roland :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: anything over 12.89%|pg||
nt|brolucius: 50% is not 'excellent' for Roland, but it is well above his average.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Americans stopped in game next door|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some players (not me) like leading aces against a slam. Against such opponents you should play the leader for the @DQ when he does not lead a diamond.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well bid, even though you might say that the slam is 50-50.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is in fact better than that because a diamond lead will help you.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the bidding is as it seems, then 6@C was quite a bold bid by South. |pg||
nt|gio 89: 3@H by N most likely showed @D shortness|pg||
nt|gio 89: and 4NT is turbo|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H seems to be a cuebid so N must have a good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the penultimate round of the qualifying. After round 10, top eight advance to tomorrow's quarter-finals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 163-164 VPs to qualify is my estimate|pg||
nt|minimeck: first through third get to pick their opponents in order for the quarterfinals, still alot of incentive |pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: With 10 points in his own hand, East does not expect partner to hold anything of value and so chooses a safe trump lead.|pg||

nt|wiki: ok  still the marks wrong|pg||
nt|zebutin: to me 2 rounds of @S at that point seem stricly worse than just 1 round and play @H A + H (because if you get ruffed with last @S, you still have 1 @S in dummy to ruff last @H ...|pg||

nt|bebechira: a lot of superstars in the teams|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 3NT might make here by South, on a spade lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: i do like the choice made at the other table however, with a 3rd seat opener of 1d, that seems much more preferable to the balance|pg||
nt|ady: spade slam here|pg||
nt|exerdar: a slam board.. every slam possible withouth hearts:)|pg||
nt|ady: should get there if south opens 2@C|pg||
nt|exerdar: ofcourse nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Must have returned the @c.|pg||

mb|d|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|bebechira: the cheap slam scored 13 for us :)|pg||
mb|2H!|an|p/c|nt|janhamhurg: 4 hearts makes on a spade lead, but will be difficult on a dia or a cl lead|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4nt ?|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Yeah, I think she did|pg||
nt|Walddk4: she, sorry|pg||
nt|santyclz: It's possible the way the play was shown. |pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: may not be so easy to reach a slam after 1 spade opened|pg||
mb|2S|nt|penseur9: a strong @H contract here for EW|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cards lie well for 3NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: not sure if EW have changed their NT ranges, would have expected a 2nt opener from brescoll here, 1@c will work much better :p|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  at the other table, 1N went down 2|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  A nice start for US|pg||
nt|santyclz: The defense here was "suboptimal".|pg||
nt|runnerup: but can they find @c here |pg||
mb|d|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He should play all to make this and will.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|zebutin: E/W got this one cheap, might even make, or @D H lead making comfortably...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt seems like normal spot to be in, might have some difficulties with entries for @C, but when @D 10 drops has always sure entry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might need a good guess  in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you fond of 2 nt with W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: 6 @C is on and  needs 1/1 clubs  which is odds or @h finesse  also you can try to get cover on @DQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: Juzz has a very good feel at the table.... i think he will make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not - perhaps a discard on @d|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Any guesses as to what 2@c here was showing?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like "pointed top" suits - @s and @ds.|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's just a guess though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: 2 aces and a trump|pg||
nt|bebechira: in theory lol|pg||
mb|5C|nt|runnerup: previos hand number 2 both rooms made 4 @s -which should have been beaten -no guess in @h helps if south takes his ace and playes a small @c to his partner to play @s |pg||
nt|penseur9: the lead will decide how many extra tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4NT does not really get the imformation of great diamond cards  and the Q@C   and nothing opposite the singleton heart|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Hard to bid 6 with only one ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: this helps. Now the discard a real possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: 3nt a good spot on this hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome everyone, sorry for delay on commentator :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Matt and GÃ¶ran|pg||

pc|dA|nt|play4fun55:  still some work to be done|pg||
nt|ady: now may get there|pg||
nt|galois85:  what is E thinking about?|pg||
nt|ady: better west refraains from the double of 3@H  when he will be on lead |pg||
nt|exerdar: probably south is thinking|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bebechira: 10 boards matches... not a lot of boards to recover the bad ones :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|zebutin: or without @S lead has always sure entry in @S suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: currently our 4th and 5th place teams here, should have no problem making here :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 no looks fine|pg||
nt|minimeck: and indeed that is where they will play it :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: lol your lead:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: i expect a spade lead here from west, although he has some choices, no winning options :p|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @d could have been 800 with best defence ,but now 420 |pg||
pc|d5|nt|wiki: I thin 4 @D is splinter|pg||
nt|wiki: luckily we have very qualified operator|pg||
nt|minimeck: although a diamond is more logical|pg||
nt|minimeck: given the fact if his partner had any real spades he likely would have opened in 3rd seat|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wiki: well done ladies|pg||
mc|12|nt|wiki: you have problems only if  clubs are 2 0 with W  East can easily be endplayed|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I am asked what 3NT is. I don't know, perhaps a non-serious slam try|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|minimeck: that would make sense, certainly not a choice of games :)|pg||

nt|zebutin: E/W got to cheap save on this one, 11 card @D fit played quite nicely|pg||
nt|zebutin: if Rubenis doesn't open, Nyberg will...|pg||
nt|zebutin: but A+A+K and 6 card suit is enough for most people...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: partial for N/S|pg||
nt|petka: partial for EW actually :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: on 24, edgtton not suprisingly does open 2nt as we discussed, might be more imps for the americans|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: easy game here, 3 no or 4 spade|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: 3 hearts? wow|pg||
nt|ady: lay not good for 6@C   especially on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Koistinen doesn't see fullgame even against maximum, so passed with decent hand, maybe getting nice penalty score...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this gets him up to 8. Let's see if defence can manage 5|pg||
nt|henryb:  and even then a @d shift will beat it easily|pg||
nt|bebechira: club lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: he can make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: W has taken A@d before, and after choise @s|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: even playing strong club that is too much|pg||
nt|minimeck: that will give north quite a quandary now|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: in closed somebody was very aggressive N or S not sure which one|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal @s game against 5 in minor 500 or 800 ,but ew not in perhaps|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s is youthful exuberance|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|psyck: both tables found dbl with South hand, i may not have|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no only 7 but West unhappy|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: n/s plays polish club|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT likely makes|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead likely from south hand|pg||
nt|ady: east will try to cash 2 spades and enter west hand with a heart ruff to discard a diamond on K@S   as it can be seen this will not go well|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: and then 4 dia, now its ugly|pg||
nt|gsper:  Let's see if that D can scare EW out of 3NT.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|wiki: S should have passed 2 @H  I have decided now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the suit is to bad to jump|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wiki: in closed room I mean|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: put the spade jack into the heart suit and all is ok|pg||
nt|minimeck: will have trouble coming home here, couldn't diagnose the spade fit after the jump|pg||
nt|minimeck: and it does indeed, 2 spades should have little trouble but 3nt is ice cold on this layout|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes! Of course, they might have missed it under their own steam.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|runnerup: 1nt or 2 @h looks ok no more -some opens 1nt -passed-not here|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They are playing precision|pg||
nt|minimeck: both both east and west here caught at the top of their range, somewhat difficult to get to game here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|runnerup: this has no chance|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|wiki: it is always more difficult on 2 level|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: well still if north would rebid 3 spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: even guessing the trump suit are still two losers|pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps north was concerned that 3s was nf|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|zebutin: declarer seems to be losing @C, @H and 3@D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: then they should work on theire system:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|penseur9: chances increased by the @C lead :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|minimeck: upgrading the west hand to 1nt opener is an option, however|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  I would have opened a 20-22 2 nt in South, but I guess they play 21-22 2 nt ?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|galois85:  double dummy can be done 6@c: take diamond leading with ace, then q@s for the king, club finesse and then a@h and heart finesse, but seeing just 26 cards seems better to ruff an heart for discarding the @d on the @sK...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|runnerup: lead was bad but doent help this ho,e|pg||
nt|zebutin: they have played faster and have only 2 deals left to compare|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|wiki: I think N expected S to have about 18/20 hp|pg||
nt|wiki: now @C and throw @Ss|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  NS had an unimpeded auction to 6@c in the OR on board 24|pg||
nt|santyclz: N has the right minor suit card.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|santyclz: Except on a @clead if the q is played.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hope we get some swingy hands soon:)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|santyclz: Gm Andre.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: close to making? picks up anyway|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @c 10 causes problems|pg||
nt|minimeck: other table simply went 1@s 1nt float|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: difficult to bid 3NT... @d raise is unbiddable|pg||

nt|brolucius: Many players venture a negative double on breathtakingly little, Certainly they would on what South has.|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: i would x with south, seems normalish to me|pg||
pc|h3|nt|minimeck: in any case, another swing to the americans letting them have it easy in 1@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even elderly BBO commentators with half their grey cells a distant memory would probably double.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|minimeck: this seems to be a case of pessimistic thinking by south perhaps, sometimes you just have to make the normal bid, if it doesn't work out so be it|pg||
nt|brolucius: A witty kibitzer adds: Half their grey hair a distant memory as well!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You could ask yourself this question: "What would I have bid if Easthad passed? 1@H. So why would I not bid 1@H after his 1@S overcall". Because that is what double says|pg||

mb|2H|nt|wiki: Los Tollos is kind of spanish, but in finnish Tollo is how could I say it nicely, very wise guy maybe even stupid|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: N-s are certainly trying.|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: 1D opening is usually 4+ cards in diamonds in an unbal distribution|pg||
nt|minimeck: bold 3@h by bos, but in the end looks to be headed for a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: im predicting 10 tricks, so 130 difference for 4 imps|pg||
nt|minimeck: one of the big benefits of opening NT, make it tough for the opps to come in on alot of hands|pg||
nt|runnerup: sorry youth so at least 3 @s|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bebechira: we will note score many VPS from this one it seems...|pg||

nt|sybarra: not every partnership plays this treatment|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 450|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: there is a safety play in diamonds   but I dont think this will make if diamonds are 4-0  even picking the suit up for 1 loser  as would have difficulty  using the hearts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|runnerup: ns has 7+ tricks in nt -but this looks strange contract and too high|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: for NS|pg||
nt|zebutin: Koistinen might feel he has done enough, partner could have just 12 points|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|runnerup: good lead|pg||

pc|cK|nt|penseur9: certainly way to high here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: X doesn't work|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: every bid was an overbid here so 1 off is the logical result...|pg||
nt|minimeck: for those wondering about the format for this event, it is a two day round robin followed by full day knockout matches for the top 8 teams|pg||
nt|minimeck: the rest of the teams play a consolation BAM teams :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: still very tight on the leaderboard, 8-16 with an 11 VP diference|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: No play here, but E/W can make a lot of hearts|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: jus pesky the @H's are 3/1 |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: (game in hearts)|pg||
nt|ady: cash out 2 top diamonds   and then set up hearts   as it happens 13 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wiki: But they cab play cards Viitasalo Salomaa are in national team and Viitasalo is also coaching them|pg||

nt|minimeck: nice heart shift from tebha, passive def might save an imp|pg||
pc|sK|nt|zebutin: now seems like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: fierce auction in other room|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2 club losers and the ace of spades for an easy 620|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: a LAW bid from S - and as u see with both red kings onside easy 4@H by EW|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But no one can bid, really.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|minimeck: a safe exit here by boss, they will need to attack clubs when they get back in|pg||
pc|hA|nt|minimeck: although now he has no chance|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so its down 1, no swing|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bebechira: at least some imps on 25.... NS did not bid the slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: very interesting how pre-empts work sometimes, by not raising to 4h, drodge only bid 3@s (could have bid 4), so south just gave up|pg||
pc|h5|nt|zebutin: this seem to make as stated earlier, so Finland most likely wont lose imps on this one...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|zebutin: yes, more contested auction, here 2nt opening made opponents go quietly|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|zebutin: Brown is trying to make me feel bad for chancing my prediction to 11 tricks...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|minimeck: at the other table, south opened 1 club and west overcalled his 4 card @s suit, east then psyched 1nt and now have bought the pot in 3@s x, big swing to France|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: 4 @h can be beaten 3nt looks ok |pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely to make|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  this will be a close encounter. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: @c9 only chance|pg||
nt|pelu: the transfer overcall can give somme good informations, but also give opp a lot of space and extra bids|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: even 4 @s down :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: 2@C maybe some gazilli variant, so 2@H denies 8+ or so hcp... |pg||
nt|psyck: EW play strong @c, so no gaz|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: it is a some kind of gazilli|pg||
nt|psyck: E just tried a tactical approach|pg||
pc|s6|nt|zebutin: 3@C most likely puppet stayman and 3nt denying 4 or 5 card majors|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: well. if the club king was the dia king 6 is easy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: difficult lead from W|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: w thought a lot|pg||
nt|pelu: a brave pass after his weak opening|pg||
nt|galois85:  too much values in spades and too less hearts, I agree with david|pg||
pc|sT|nt|penseur9: yes 3nt definitly best contract here|pg||
nt|pelu: not a opening for me|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Not the best lead for the defense here.|pg||
nt|minimeck: as cards lie 12 tricks available in the 4-3 fit :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|runnerup: if red lead -ruff should be found|pg||
nt|zebutin: good lead, not everyones choice surely to lead from K98x to strong hand|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  j of spade in dummy is a golden card|pg||
nt|minimeck: might need to duck the heart, but that seems a very risky proposition|pg||
pc|c7|nt|runnerup: south declaring it helps|pg||
nt|ady: this should be at least down 1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ianmcc: he'll likely scramble 8 trix|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: 1 tricks for S|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry, but i woulnt think about 6 spades at the table so i dont consider it here seeing all the cards:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: as you said, must find something to analyze on a hand like this|pg||
nt|minimeck: but your correct, too often commentators can be unfair looking at all 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: W have shown his distribution after a relay sequence|pg||
nt|minimeck: bos thinking about making a move here perhaps, with distribution shown not the worst hand he could have|pg||
nt|runnerup: entry problems but makes ofcause|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wiki: Linden is sitting like stone I think he moved once in 1973 in bridge table but we were playing night robber that time|pg||
nt|zebutin: with any other lead atleast 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wiki: and he smiled once in 1984 / he is a real poker face|pg||
nt|kaapo:  I try to fetch the bronze match result also|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but still east doesnt know about the vasted king of clubs|pg||
nt|minimeck: opposite a min still throws in the towell|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so after all the choice to pass was  alittle lucky|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch overtaken  and a trump back |pg||
nt|ady: not easy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|minimeck: indeed, could have been cold if he had the diamond king, decided wasn't going to go fishing for that|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but a nice system they play|pg||
nt|minimeck: ARG URU will have to regroup after this match, now tetering on the q-zone|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: in nat system you need a jacoby 2 notrump for those hands|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|zebutin: no x, N is just happy that for once opponents are playing in her (?) 6 card suit|pg||
nt|ady: got the right idea|pg||
pc|cA|nt|minimeck: plenty of tricks here, i rekon usa wouldn't mind a few flat boards to walk out with 22 VP|pg||
nt|minimeck: almost impossible to do that in practice, risk going down when normalish breaks can be cold|pg||
pc|c5|nt|penseur9: here we go :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: play should go relatively quickly here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  that's actually the wrong way to play hearts with known long spades in East|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|minimeck: will trust pard's carding now for -1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wiki: so S  will be here ok for 2 down I think|pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile, italy escape on the previous board, as declarer tried to drop the stiff king offside and went -1 in 3@s x|pg||
nt|minimeck: 9 instead of 16|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: nice defence|pg||
nt|galois85:  very good!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|zebutin: other semifinal with 2 finnish teams battling it out ended with 1- 42 imp score|pg||
nt|bebechira: 22?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, this works better...|pg||
mc|9|nt|zebutin: so team Finland will be playing against winners of this match|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry, my mistake, W didn't open :(|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Will they beat it now?|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes they were kidding us|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @h is easyer|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: sry i lost a card... When N play @d it was taken by W not by E, played A@c and club...|pg||

nt|zebutin: 1@D 17+|pg||
nt|bebechira: this looks flat as well|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: costa an imps:(|pg||
nt|minimeck: :) and one back for la albiceleste|pg||
nt|minimeck: I expect 5@d -1 will be normalish accross the field|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D on hand 17 flat|pg||
nt|santyclz: Np, operating is a tough job.|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|zebutin: would you open 1@H or 1@S with S hand?|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@s|pg||
nt|ianmcc: ggod slam to be out of. I have hopes|pg||
nt|minimeck: be sure to stay tuned everyone, as the Swiss phase rounds down, there is sure to be alot of action yet to come!|pg||
nt|minimeck: third seat 1@s by maximo?|pg||
nt|minimeck: 11 results in so far for that board 7 down in 5 or 6d, 2 making 3nt, and 2 in partial|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: he has play very fast|pg||
mb|d|nt|wiki: two boards here so it will be  time for winning moves I suppose  Paganus is going to have 10 in the last board|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam EW anyone?|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  3 nt has a fighting chance|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 sp?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|runnerup: a slam here 3 options -6 @d best|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that should deter them|pg||
nt|petka: a splinter diamonds is nice, but S would rather see a splinter spades :) Still, all those aces and the bonus J and JT are tempting|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very thin game E/W maybe 3NT better|pg||
nt|runnerup: west can punt 4|pg||
nt|santyclz: For some reason some players don't seem to realize that their first priority should be to insure the vg operator can clearly see all their bids and plays...|pg||
mb|d|nt|penseur9: right Markku|pg||
nt|zebutin: with 1@S you get to tell 5-5 quite easily|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, a quiet 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard bids anything,  I hit the deck with S |pg||
nt|ady: part score hand   likely 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3@s is ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: i must say i would blast 4@H with @S hand now...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, not much option with such shape & non reversible values anyway|pg||
nt|zebutin: i think nyberg told 8+ with @C suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: with 2@D that is|pg||
nt|petka: scandinavian style that shows extras with diamond splinter. Hard to stop below 5 if this is such a bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: or not|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  Would you raise 2@h to 3 vul, Matt?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wiki: looks like 5 imps more so 2 imps still and a nice board coming next|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns in bidding and ew quite lazy|pg||
nt|petka: I guess not|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2???????|pg||
nt|sybarra: whoaaaaaaaaaaa |pg||
nt|sybarra: optimism??? |pg||
nt|minimeck: opp my p's 14 16 no, but perhaps|pg||
nt|bebechira: i was thinking flat as 620 flat|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ianmcc: 5 Ok anyway|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  I think they have one loser in every suit in 4h|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  in d even 2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2 in @d?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: now Pete has to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  Shirley, you can't (should not) pass partner in a possible 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Way too high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: West could have the hand he actually has.|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S? - I was just between 2@s and 3@S :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|zebutin: either 5@S or 5@C make, anything over 5@S is little tougher...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wiki: we have lost some specs to spingold  /  why |pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@H = 4@S for me...not 4@H...|pg||
nt|ady: I was well out|pg||
pc|c7|nt|zebutin: just say i had couple @H mixed with my @S suit if partner asks...|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h also ok, helps pd make a choice if opps bid further|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was passing any 2 level bid,  maybe I am the old fogey here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|play4fun55:  2 losers in the d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 0 in @s|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  true|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so this is a good contract but finesses don't work|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petka: a popular style is 3C=minimum, 3D=extras with no splinter, 3H=club splinter, 3S=diamond splinter etc|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 500 agains 3nt =600,but in 5 @c you must quess well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|zebutin: yes, you are better positioned after 4@H if opponents bid on|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand opponents know more about your hand, which might affect defence...so everything has upside and downside...|pg||
nt|minimeck: cailau decides to call it a day in 3h, will make 4 with the ace of @s luckily onside|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder why N did not bid 2NT over 2@S.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|zebutin: most likely defence will take their 2 @H tricks|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But, maybe Juniors lacking experience get excited when they see a lot of points.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wiki: 4 @S is not bad contract but...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  You look for a 4-3 major by bidding 2@h over 2@d|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|wiki: played by east I think it could be on|pg||
nt|zebutin: and after that declarer just tests spades and clubs and claims|pg||
nt|zebutin: Latvians did well to reach 6@H at deal number 7 on other table too, so no swing for Finland|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c6|nt|penseur9: this should prove costly for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok sure  and hope he plays 2 @S |pg||
nt|minimeck: we will see how emmons views the south hand, he has been extremely agressive thus far|pg||
pc|hT|nt|play4fun55:  since they use transfers over 1 club, would not a jump to 3 nt by East be a reasonable way of giving W a choice between 3 nt and 4 h ?|pg||
nt|pelu: we are not juniors, Valerie :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Which serves them well in other areas of bidding.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Ni, sigh, unfortunately..|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: No|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|santyclz: USA won 4 imps on the 2@S-3 hand when the Italians got x'd in 3@Ds.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|pc|dJ|nt|pelu: @HA and @H = safe for 9, the winning chance is @DKQ stiff, |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|minimeck: with 6-4 he wanted to show the clubs, k10 and stiff ace, can't blame him|pg||
nt|ady: this may scrape home with spades 3-3   |pg||
nt|ady: now 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wiki: no, it cannot be made when @D is singelton |pg||

nt|gsper:  Can that @D4 have been suit preference, or was it just another card?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mrdct: rock and hard place for declarer here|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting choice here|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also specs,  always fun to hear from you |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Apparently Japan received a 1 VP penalty at the start of this match - perhaps late arrival at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: well|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting, that would be very suprising to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: 1st round well commented at my table|pg||
nt|minimeck: 1nt, however, can be set :) |pg||
nt|ady: no reason for south to have bid 1 more   has bid his values|pg||
mb|3N|an|3-5-5-0|nt|exerdar: 3clubs and @d  for defance ,game'll go down|pg||
nt|exerdar: for running skores:|pg||
nt|exerdar: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  1N was asking about values and 2@c showed min values.  2@d was shape relay, but that's about as much as we know|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Oh, well, I guess the operator can fill in details :) and clearly, we dont' know what we're talking about |pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: south know all distribution|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|zebutin: didn't see that one coming, but seems that has 4@H+4@D + couple @S tricks....opponents can take 2@C + 2 aces when ever...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just 8|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  should just scramble home|pg||
mb|4S|nt|janhamhurg: so some imps back|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: if he doesn't draw trumps east gets a @c ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: y|pg||
mb|4N|an|asking|nt|blum1956: Yes, LAtvia is in 2@s on board 10 which surely makes (@sA lead). Congratulations Latvia!|pg||
nt|psyck: no scope to recover here, so it will be Latvia-Finland final|pg||
nt|blum1956: So Kauko Koistinen - Clas Nyberg (winners of the invitational pairs) and Ugis Jansons (runner-up) secured more medals (this time in teams)|pg||
nt|mrdct: south may have done better to play @c5 to mask east's count|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good|pg||
nt|mrdct: but justin howard has read it|pg||
nt|minimeck: this will make with the club positioning|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: it takes a momen finding clubs 3  0 but  he can do it|pg||
nt|minimeck: thanks everyone for tuning in, next segment scheduled to resume at|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so thanks all for watching bye |pg||
nt|minimeck: 06:00 New York time, (40 minutes from now)|pg||
mb|5C|an|0/2 honor !d|mb|p|mb|5D!|an|asking|nt|zebutin: so looks to be making, which would be good score for Latvians|pg||
nt|runnerup: now no q of @s so perhaps 5 @s pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: he is very careful  seldon spreading his hand|pg||
mb|5S|an|0/2 honor in !s|nt|vugraphzmy: 4nt is not RKCB|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: they are giving honors in 3 suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|mrdct: possible 14 imps for Australia now|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: hoping that def throws some @Ds to get one @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I am not fond of Brescoll's auction. 3N over 3@d would seem to be indicated|pg||
nt|exerdar: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  went down in OR  on hand 19|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: wd for E/W|pg||
nt|zebutin: not so easy to stop in 3nt when you have 8 card major fit and 3-1 in other major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: club lead beats 3 nt|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, not so easy to find one from AQxx though|pg||
nt|zebutin: this table is ready, so thanks for all for watching|pg||
nt|santyclz: In many precision systems when responding to asking bids, you only show ace, k or q as an honor.|pg||
