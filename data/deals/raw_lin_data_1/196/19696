pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  but to bid it, E has to imagine exactly such a hand by partner - with long side suit|pg||

pc|hT|nt|peachy: Excellent record for her|pg||

pc|s9|nt|panja: hi Pramod, all|pg||
nt|panja: 7@D better than 7Nt here..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi this is Makarand ;)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N could be hardly blamed for this opening lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: on correct defense yes they can beat it by 1|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: or, rather, 7@S..|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jeetu in a trance|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nkgupt: n    |pg||
nt|panja: and the play will go...remove trumps, ruff a Club...cash last trump discarding Dummy @S, and then @HAK..black suit squeeze if @S don't break|pg||
nt|twcho: 7@d is probably the best contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  was it @sK indeed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can only imagine S's desperation|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|twcho: with squeeze possibility|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm still looking to understand why K might have worked/under what circumstances|pg||
nt|peachy: Good play, tring to make and if the 8 didnt work, didnt matter because it was going down anyway without it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c4|pc|s7|nt|panja: of course @S are 32...so there are easy 13 tricks..|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|psridhar: EW likely to end in 4@s -stiff @H led, win @s ace, and take a ruff...still no beat |pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: the scoring is Total IMPS |pg||
nt|ianmcc: the perennial question to open or not 11 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: well played for -300. not a great result|pg||

mb|1S|nt|strike12: yes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: North/south better silent here|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS dont have values for 3N|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think @d9 promotes|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|nt|ianmcc: to open S or not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html is the exact webpage for running scores |pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzjh: they just informed me they change the system with vulnerabiity and this is precision modified|pg||
nt|peachy: East hand is much too good for any sort of premptive action, 1S is normal|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ianmcc: Precision might help E/W keep low|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand for competition...NS make at most 8 tricks in any contract...but have 23 HCP...they will feel like trying for a game..let us see|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|strike12: To all Kibs, since being a Pairs Tournament, there are no comparisions shown as results will be posted at finish of all tables. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: good decision|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats my formula for balancing when they havent found a fit = " dont"|pg||
nt|panja: good pass by Rajesh..|pg||
nt|panja: are they playing prec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 3N is making double dummy|pg||
nt|panja: easier in Precision...|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C might be transfer, in competition|pg||
nt|peachy: transfer to 2D, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was alerted by Satya |pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: 4@c might be FIT showing with @d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h close but diamonds nasty|pg||
nt|psridhar: are we going to witness a lightner X of 6@H here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Venky is fearless balancer otherwise|pg||
nt|peachy: Since they play transfer over 1C opening, I boldly assumed they also play transfer in compe tition, a method that is steadily gaining popularity|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ianmcc: 3NT might have made here|pg||
nt|twcho: east will be thrown in in @s and give a @d to south at the end|pg||
nt|panja: of course..this is not a good contract..2@H is better...but most likely in @H they would have gone too far...|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzjh: all bids were alerted |pg||
nt|psridhar: possibly without the lightner it is easier to beat slam|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that would help make it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|babs59: and board 1 reflects that policy too|pg||

nt|strike12: last board of this set, |pg||

nt|peachy: 1H = limites to about 15. Mod Precision|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  and 1NT - kind of 1-round-forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||

nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html - running scores after round 10, updates will be posted there shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: will be S Gupta Venky Vs Sreedharan Daxindas|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzjh: sandeep in a trance|pg||
nt|babs59: Venky has a great hand opposite Majors|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is Drury...@H fit...|pg||
nt|panja: gives a chance to North to have some say|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes min 4card as announced|pg||
nt|twcho: north could double|pg||
mb|3C|nt|babs59: pity the splinters are the same suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sunit has gr8 support for @d too -but 500 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: so Rajesh after exlaation took his bid back |pg||
nt|twcho: yes, he doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders before this round are |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should N bid better minor this time? I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: S Gupta Venky are current leaders|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should S introduce 6th- heart or 3-cards @s support - a problem indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: Aah, we get to watch the leaders next round|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: too many|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the results have been posted on the Results link on webpage http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: at the bottom of the page there is a hyperlink to results |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing ordinary 1NTF, North's rebid is 2C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzjh: inquiry from declerer about the lead |pg||
nt|strike12: 10 tricks now |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing support doubles, the decision is pretty easy = Dbl|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzjh: Ajay thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the rare exception when it could only be 2-card suit, normally longer minor or 2C with 3-3 minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a bid by S!|pg||
nt|peachy: South's bid is much too frisky, given their methods, but he is probably attempting to get something back from the unfortunate -930.  I dont like that strategy though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder what was the reason|pg||
nt|peachy: But that is an "if" because I dont know if they have Support Dbl on card|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and with @c shortness the choice could be dbl|pg||
mb|d|nt|nkgupt: dont think 4@s can be beaten|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: North over the top|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Subhash Gupta + Venky |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ianmcc: but not impossible - well done|pg||

pc|h8|nt|vugraphzjh: director called |pg||
nt|psridhar: NS will win a couple of IMPs in the wash here|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|strike12: but N might get fished by the lead and try something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 R Venkatesh A Srinivasan|pg||
nt|peachy: At least whenever I tried that , I just get more minus.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 round of @h let declarer with no chance|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: this needs care|pg||
nt|twcho: how about trump lead and @d shift?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzjh: about the explanation of the meaning of 2S now all ok|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 'slam' effect from last deal perhaps|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good auction for partnership|pg||
nt|peachy: This would have been a working sacrifice, had either N or S been void in clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4 Jaggy Rajesh |pg||
nt|peachy: Surely was not bid to make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|strike12: doesnt matter now|pg||
