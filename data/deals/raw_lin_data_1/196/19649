nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: HEART SHOWS SPADES HERE|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: Hola :)|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  For live results, you can go here: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: tks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ferlema: hola Bobby|pg||
nt|ferlema: que alegria|pg||
nt|ybob: que tal Fernando :)|pg||
nt|ybob: un placer|pg||
nt|ferlema: bien gracias :)|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C perhaps denies three spades, hence alerted|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|minimeck: wow.... |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D = apoyo @H mejor mano que apoyo directo|pg||
nt|gsper:  A modern style weak 2.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Good Morning everyone, we are now underway here in the quarterfinals :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|minimeck: fireworks to start things off... here lankveld 6-4 in the majors blasts slam opposite bos' michaels, missing 2 cashing aces, |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H rechaza game|pg||
nt|exerdar: pass really?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|galois85: it seems 4@sX -3 2@d 2@c 1@s and 1@h|pg||
nt|ferlema: 1@H double 2@D es tra to 2@H con un muy buen apoyo de 3 cartas|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: rare for auctions to die in 2 of a minor these days|pg||
nt|athene: but since neither side has a fit, i guess it's ok here :)|pg||
nt|athene: if east is really taking this long about his opening lead that tells declarer quite a bit about his hand i.e. he has a horrible hand to lead from!|pg||
nt|gsper:  That kind of bidding is supposed to call for trump lead, but here decl needs no ruffs.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|minimeck: will likely find the shift here to set 6s, however, the other table, q@c lead allows 7@dx to roll home|pg||
nt|gsper:  Even less now.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|ferlema: 2@S en el 3/3 interesante|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|minimeck: 17 imps to ned juniors|pg||
nt|gsper:  And a 4@H I would not have dared.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s6|nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: reminiscent of the famous hand france vs usa in olympiad 1980s where hamman had to pick which ace was standing up|pg||
pc|cA|nt|exerdar: amazing 200  versus 7@d |pg||
nt|exerdar: hi|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|galois85: bad return... now just -1|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|athene: if you are worried that the contract might actually make, you don't lead the singleton|pg||
nt|athene: because the danger is it's a huge double fit hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed. never easy to lead from those kinds of hands :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|minimeck: here with the club cooperating, will make by guessing the heart, now that is not a problem :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: now east has to find his partner for the ruff - well there's only one chance|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|c7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|c8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ybob: si siguen @D descarta @C el carteador|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 7@d oh dear|pg||
nt|exerdar: his nickname is Bombacii(bomberman)  so he could do everything:)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|h7|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|h9|nt|minimeck: ARG URU qualified top of the table, and selected turkey with there first pick.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Well defended.|pg||

nt|galois85: better anticipate clubs... after a@d and k@d |pg||
nt|galois85: nothing to do|pg||

nt|ferlema: la manod e Este parecia mas poderosa que lo que era en realidad, el segundo doblo estuvo de mas|pg||
nt|ybob: nice spanish Murat :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Rens|pg||
nt|rensph: hi all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 1@c strong or something else ?|pg||
nt|exerdar: showing 2plus cards i quess|pg||
nt|minimeck: their* still 4am here in the US, need to put on the cup of coffee :) |pg||
mb|1C|nt|gsper:  But it worked nicely.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Germ|pg||
nt|minimeck: Garcia Da Rosa and Crusizio are a very experienced pair, have played for a long time but this is their first international competition together.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kemperg: HI|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW should get too high in @H here.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||
nt|athene: just lose the sixth club most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2c=d or majors|pg||
nt|minimeck: if any kibitzers have info about the NS pair, it is appreciated :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you need to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the tables are not linked|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mrdct: moysian 6@d here|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a big fan of that sort of thing though|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3N|nt|athene: it helps if you can make unusual notrump bids later in the auction with confidence partner will know you are showing diamonds of course :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: nine tricks available in 3nt here with both kings onside :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: will S just super accept spades or bid 4 ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gsper:  3@H presumably something like 6-9 with both M.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C 33, 3NT is on|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi henry|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2D GENERALLY FORCING|pg||
nt|minimeck: kib informs me NS also one of turkeys more seasoned pairs, finished 4th in the youth pairs last time in istanbul |pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all|pg||
nt|minimeck: we should see some fine bridge today from these two!, |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: 3nt extremely unlikely to be the best contract when you have such a shapely two-suiter|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: 3nt is for balanced hands and one-suiters|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, agreed, very suprising, especially if 3h was a cue|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kemperg: good bidding NOT to be in 3NT:(|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: was 2NT just general good/bad?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: wow 4@S by N is abit much - even with the fortunate lie in D this is unlikely to make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ybob: un claro paso de W que será penalizado !|pg||
nt|ferlema: la defensa debe tener cuidado en no bloquear el corazon|pg||
nt|gsper:  I did not expect to be that much right.|pg||
nt|guillemin: bad lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: 6NT right sided here|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mrdct: quite a lucky make with @c 3-3 and @sK onside|pg||
nt|ybob: es necesario tomar y continuar para derrotar|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|galois85: it seems -1 by guessing the @dj |pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps the operator could inform us of the alerts|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might not realise they have any diamond fit at all - he might just think 2nt was showing a competitive 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES IT WAS|pg||
nt|athene: i would just rebid 3@D with the east hand, and if i get too high, so be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: west explained it could be weak with clubs or some good hands|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: ahora @D al K , J @D finesse y gana|pg||
nt|henryb:  now he will make 5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|minimeck: an immediate answer for the US, EW have bid to 6@d after a 3h overcall and 4d bid|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|mrdct: undo that - the @s hook and @c break are only good for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|MolvaM: welcome peter lund :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  well he could have|pg||
pc|c9|nt|minimeck: thanks Giulio :) @H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: leading away from kings is just a bad idea|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be a quick 9 tricks here |pg||
pc|h7|nt|galois85: welcome peter|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|athene: unless there are very strong indications from the bidding that it's necessary|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|moonbeam42:  Looks like down 1 for EW|pg||
pc|cK|nt|moonbeam42:  the other table opted to pass 1@s|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: operator I am being informed: name is Gandoglia with 'G' in north :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kdr_fm: -1 as predicted|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ferlema: 12 bazas|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: the italians tend to play that opener just doubles with any good hand so he is free to bid his suits on a shapely hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: that might work better here but of course you might argue that giving up a support double is too high a price to pay|pg||
