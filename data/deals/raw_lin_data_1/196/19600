nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||

mb|3S|nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: last set was 44-39 heaps of imps traded|pg||

mb|p|nt|panosk: N doubled 5@H so defence was easy in 6@S in closed room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcwla: A nice third-seat weak 2 if available.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  trick is for NS to stay low |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: if S bids his hearts.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ianmcc: partial for N/S but they could get higher|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c bergen I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@D misguided in third seat.  It's their hand - put some pressure on.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now, let's talk about this double -- or the lack of a double by the N hand in similar situations.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats what i call trump support |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and does, finally a 10 point opener gets a good result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beegen raise I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bergen|pg||
mb|2S|nt|blewah: and S decided he likes his hand a lot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C was bergen as I look at it and S upgraded his hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need this trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D Ace and @H back:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the defense should be pretty easy as long as W doesn't get overly anxious and cashes out early|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: looks like -1 again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep   could be -2 if they can get second ruff |pg||
nt|panosk: @D2 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd ruff = the same 2 trump tricks he started with?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: You and your favorite partner need to have agreement on what it means: does it ask for a @D lead (so that if you don't double you are suggesting a different lead) or does it say "I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: have a 2@D rebid that they stole"?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jcwla: I prefer the latter meaning and trust that pd will lead my suit in the absence of a clearly better alternative; however, I do have some pds who require the double if I want the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: lead of that suit.|pg||
nt|peachy: Again, remembering Precision context|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: bad break in trumps 4@H had no chance gd game though|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D isnt simple support in @D must be 2way checkback with game forc hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  at 50 a pop, down 1 or 2 shouldn't make much difference as it's almost impossible to stop in 2@s or 2@h with the NS hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: probably another push |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|panosk: for more info check this link http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TwoWayCheckback.html|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: good unblock N after his good lead|pg||

nt|blewah: another example that a singleton meets xxx can be very valuable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi=weak on one major|pg||
nt|ianmcc: who wants to be in 6?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: like a wk 2 bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree, no harm to pass 1@H and wait for P's response who is not a passed hand.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  still, need to guess @s Q and need K@d on side...so not a great slam|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|peachy: E in good position to check on keycards |pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed, 3NT .|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2N guarantees 4@s...many play garbage stayman and would have to bid 2@s with S hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|panosk: E doesnt know which major but he correctly thinks its spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are various methods, my multi 2@D = weak 2 either major OR 20-22 with a 5 card suit OR and 8+ playing tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a lot of folks include a strong bid in multi  |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not as a rule with most pard's I play with on bbo |pg||
nt|andyv:  but momentum may put them there|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: or 2 strong as in NZ version|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may try 5@d now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 finesses.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kemperg: no, with garbage you have both majors and pass 2@H|pg||
nt|panosk: yes there are various version , also 1 with strong 3 suiter|pg||
nt|ianmcc: and drop|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kemperg: next|pg||
nt|sybarra: in general,  multi is not/can not be played in usa|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  W must have realized the 4@c bid was already an overbid and did well to stop in 4|pg||
nt|blewah: agree, 4@c was an upgrade|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: I see 11 tricks, 12 made in CR|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: funny USA, trying to protect the innocent, actually it's easy enough to defend|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  right...if they had garbage hand...but since 2N over 2@h would deny a 4 card major, they would have to bid 2@s with the invite hand and 4 spades.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Gary,  and many have heard me say I played in Neth.  and evey jr, youth and granny had a defense to multi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On the bidding CR had better chance of playing 6@D.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  Not true, Shirley. Multi can be used in any team game of 6+ boards where the players are "Flight A"|pg||
nt|panosk: yes if you dont know what to bid wait till they say their suit and then take action like double |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: our Juniors love to play and defend it|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcwla: Relaxing to know off a keycard, don't have to think.  Can't complain about this pace - halfway through in 40 mins.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: but it is limited Henry |pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  Limited, yes, but not prohibited|pg||
