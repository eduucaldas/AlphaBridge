nt|Walddk2: 2-2 in the majors and a 6-card minor not unusual nowadays|pg||

nt|athene: even if you beat 1nt, you would have scored better making your own contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|athene: west might do something here|pg||
nt|runnerup: coffee 3nt here|pg||
nt|athene: NV vs V, passed partner|pg||
nt|athene: he might try something like 3@D|pg||
nt|athene: or something cute like 1nt even|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not 4@D? :)|pg||
mb|2D!|an|weak|nt|Walddk2: Wehave seen that before|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is a bit boring|pg||
nt|Walddk2: over 2NT even!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|athene: i like the 1NT psyche there as next hand always doubles so it gets "auto exposed"|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: partner isn't forced to hang you, and opps often get into difficulties|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|athene: @DA to block the suit here?|pg||
nt|athene: is the lead showing an even number of diamonds? or just top of sequence?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The pysche of the day was when a French player bid 4@H over his partner's 3@S pre-empt holding xxxx spades and AQ doubleton in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: yes :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He was left to play there and went 8 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: should have been 9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 400 was cheap against 650 at the other table|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 4@SX would only have gone for 500|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: not sure declarer played this right|pg||
nt|athene: one option was to win the @DA so the king could be held up later if necessary|pg||
nt|athene: diamonds might be 5-3|pg||
nt|athene: even duck the first trick altogether|pg||
nt|runnerup: to let opponents take 800 like here in 3 @d is one way to play bridge ofcause ,but to reason to do that in every possible board|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: They never take 800, Markku, because penalty doubles no longer exist|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

mb|1C|nt|andyv:  this can make 3NT EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: this slæam is better :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Weak 2 or 5/4+?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C for NS - will EW sac with two aces?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ricky86: of course :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showing hearts i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: and that will not delight south|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think i would want to stress the hearts with north|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: is 4@H now a cue bid or re-transfer?|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 5@s-4+ in a minor 5-10hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is practical bridge, I'm all for that|pg||
nt|athene: he has more a balanced hand with scattered strength, than a heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: but i imagine 1nt was not available (probably showed clubs)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hajru:  This will probably end in 3N, making |pg||
nt|mdgraham: always depressing to see partner pass as delaer when all you hold is three jacks |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: raising clubs might work well now|pg||
nt|athene: people rarely do that, though, in this day and age|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hajru:  2@d is GF checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: maybe re transfer|pg||
nt|athene: :(|pg||

nt|athene: *south sorry|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will NOT cover @D10|pg||
nt|mdgraham: chioces would seem to be 2NT or 3@c  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: east thinking about a diamond sac?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@h??|pg||
nt|ricky86: 5@h?|pg||
nt|wboer: Good lead. @cK and @s switch is diff for decl|pg||
nt|athene: takes a club lead to beat 6@S i guess?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: This is the last round in the Swiss - 8 best to KO - Japan no 7 with 152 and Australia 1 + 2 + France No 8 with 145|pg||
nt|athene: stops declarer cashing one spade then finessing|pg||
nt|athene: because you don't have the entry to dummy when you need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If Poulat has one more to play, diamonds are 4-3 and no worries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a duck caters for a 5-2 split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2nT presumably denies three spades, and also four hearts|pg||
nt|hajru:  I think so.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|pelu: kibs help us :)|pg||

nt|athene: 1@S opener gives west a bit of a decision|pg||
nt|athene: most beginners overcall 2@D without a care in the world|pg||
nt|athene: "i would open 1@D - i will overcall 2@D!"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Don't|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south rebids 4@H to make sure of getting to game? :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Undo please Eria|pg||
nt|runnerup: or east --just kidding|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: no comments please.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the 5 IMP - in B2 EW stopped in 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess he was playing for e to be 5/5 in the blacks.|pg||
nt|athene: now if it goes 1@S - 1NT from EW, south can't really double, as that is t/o of spades|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: 5@c = min, 5@D = 1/4, 5@H = 0/3, 5@s = 2+@sq + tx Wubbo|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: ty :)|pg||
mb|2N|an|5-5 GF|nt|wboer: but the @dQ holds the trick so east had the @dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT? looks odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will pass and Lebatteux can't really bid again|pg||
nt|athene: north can bid 2@D now |pg||
nt|hajru:  I think they play Gazilli (1M-1N-2@c) for strong balanced hands, freeing up 1M-1N-2N for special hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told Gazzilli, strong 5/5....thanks|pg||
nt|hajru:  I guess N will bid 3@c and S will specifiy|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2@D or 2NT in S being non-vul or pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He has to guess which finesse to take, and if he chooses spades, he must guess who has A and Q|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: i think this is a bit of a sucker double from south in fact|pg||
nt|athene: north clearly has a hand too weak to raise diamonds over 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: and that is a very weak hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|athene: south may start with double or may just show majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C or 2@D to show the majors, depending on agreement|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble with doubling is if you then try to show both your suits you basically have forced it to game most of the time|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|athene: and that might be more than he wants to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C it is for N-S|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: You just pretend that East opened 1NT|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A good reason for letting 2@C be artificial|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes it works to be able to show clubs because even if they can bid 2 of a major, it lets partner compete with 3@C, but still, most people think showing majors is more use|pg||

nt|athene: if EW stagger into 4@S, will south try another double?|pg||
nt|athene: you might, if they have had an invitational sequence where west showed hearts|pg||

pc|h9|nt|andyv:  both E and W overbid their hands slightly|pg||

pc|hA|nt|wboer: 3NT is high but has play if @d are 3/2|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you can guarantee to keep south off lead, your best chance of a double stop in diamonds is to rise the @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to cut down on ruffs against the likely 44 fit|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and this one is comfortable as well|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He feared that Hop had clubs stopped|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: in the other room declarer got a heart lead, played a diamond to the queen himself, and then ran the clubs, and the defenders threw enough things that he felt confident about ...|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|ricky86: S didn't guess the 2@c a friendly play :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's play of A@c was predicated on the need for him to run 9 tricks immediately|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: now West will win on a endplay|pg||
nt|wboer: That is good play. With this @s break he can make it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ruffing declarer's loser with a natural trump trick.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S had no good choices there.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|wboer: If S played a @s (best) then N still could be endplayed in @d|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 (std) bit costly sometimes|pg||
nt|athene: upside down carding is just better|pg||
nt|athene: if you have 10x playing std you are better off just not giving count, most of the time; even high from 9x can be costly quite often|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: so his concern should be how the competitive auction is going to progress|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if he pre-empts wildly, he may force them into bidding a makeable 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which they otherwise would not have bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: east endplayed in trick one -id leading agains 2 1s|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is not a bad way to start off getting opps to misguess the spades|pg||
nt|athene: if west pre-empted in diamonds then yes north would be more likely to get the spades right|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: my guess is 1nt was just forced on both wests because they play inverted minors |pg||
nt|athene: but when partner has a strong hand and bids 3nt you are almost surely going to have wrongsided it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 2NT a spade raise or natural I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South has a little of both|pg||
nt|athene: north wondering 3NT or 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm...pass would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|runnerup: any game fails because @s guess will be wrong ..2nt --ok perhaps makes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: 2nt will almost never be the right contract if you have a six-card suit|pg||
nt|athene: if the suit comes in you will make an overtrick and if it doesn't you will go down in 2nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some say that 2NT is never to play. 2NT is something you bid, not a contract you play|pg||
nt|athene: this is, i think, why kokish says 2nt is forcing opposite a 2 level overcall|pg||
nt|athene: partner has six so he isn't going to pass it|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|athene: i spoke too soon :)|pg||
nt|athene: east had to find the club shift|pg||
nt|runnerup: still = @h finess now|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his partner has only 4 diamonds so diamonds are not beating this on their own|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think 3@D can achieve so much|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: might just get partner off to the wrong lead against hearts|pg||
nt|athene: north might double this for takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@S now - as in OR|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his side has slightly more than half the deck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D might be short, so maybe West cannot raise to 2@D (could be inverted) |pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: if partner has a heart stack there could be a number on offer|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s probably shows 4@s|pg||
nt|ricky86: shows 4 @s and a maximum hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same lead in OR.|pg||
nt|athene: in situations like this where it's overwhelmingly likely that the opponents are going to play it, your bids should probably be mostly lead-directing|pg||
nt|athene: mostly you expect pd to pull it but that will hopefully be ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, he feels that south bidding spades or diamonds is too likely, and too likely to be wrong|pg||

pc|d8|nt|hajru:  1@d as 3+ in standard French style?|pg||

nt|wboer: again a board that won't be published in the bulletin|pg||
nt|hajru:  Hi Hassan|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or if he has a really strong 5-5 he can bid 3@C or something|pg||
nt|athene: but he can't be that strong after only 2@D |pg||
nt|athene: interesting no redouble from south|pg||
nt|athene: i thought most played that as top honour in overcall suit, probably doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, he shows his @SK now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi|pg||
nt|veistikke:  3!n would be standar here I guess :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: looks as though it's time for east to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, coffee time|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|andyv:  W needs to preserve the K@h in dummy.  He should tackle the @s suit now|pg||
nt|athene: NS in the other room gave their opponents some chances to swing the axe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am impressed with the standard I must say. Excellent players, bright future|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it was hard|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: not sure 2@H over 2@D in the other room was a very good bid|pg||
nt|athene: the way the bidding has gone, the hand looks like a misfit|pg||

pc|c9|nt|ricky86: Percario doesn't have many choice to do in this hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|nt|athene: leading a big heart there so his partner is not tempted to play him for a singleton club, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: hop might lay down the @CK anyway for want of anything better to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are working hard to get many and good junior players all over the world. In Europe, the Netherlands, Poland and France are the strongest youth nations (then add Israel, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: playing in European events). No, I don't want to discuss politics, just stating a fact|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: yes, and it would have allowed north to lead a LOW spade against 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: and so avoid making the @S98xxx into a stopper|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: if north had been able to show the 5-5 (ghestem, say) then EW might have ended up defending|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, it's possible e-w will be in 3nt at the other table. they do have a @S stopper, but the defence has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess if anyone is playing ghestem this match it will be france :)|pg||
nt|athene: in open events, we assume a break like this is a smoke break :)|pg||

nt|athene: 14 facing 10 - sometimes you reach 3nt on these hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT by East looks water-proof, but can they bid it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: a lot depends on notrump range and things like that|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: if you play 15-17 then you show 11-14 balanced and 10 count does not move|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: if you play 14-16 then you open 1nt and partner bids game with the 10|pg||
nt|wboer: And sometimes you make 3NT. On a @s lead still off, I think|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|athene: east might bash 3nt in now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wboer: Maybe because S has two tophonneurs in @c you make it.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|runnerup: @c nicely for decl..|pg||
nt|athene: a bit unlucky for the defence here - north can't overtake without giving up a trick|pg||
nt|wboer: And defense can't develop @h-tricks too.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final, ARG URU are 3 up against NED RUM|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a good 4@h contract the EW may not get to|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, it is hard to see how to defeat this without getting a number of H tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Let's make a prediction - small swing to France on the 4@S-1 hand |pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  I wonder if 2@s is a one round force|pg||
nt|ricky86: maybe they can get if NS bid @ds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Absolutely one sided match so far.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wboer: @d ruff will beat !3s on a ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  You're not looking at the other table, are you?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Since North jumped inn 3!n i would have played AKQ. |pg||
mb|3C|nt|ricky86: 3@s is delicate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good spot reached by France in the other room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, just this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@C/5@D will cost 300 against 4 major, but with all green u normal not go for this save - but sometimes u can push opp to 5-level!!|pg||
nt|pelu: both Ns broke Rolands rule No 1 : no weak to with 2 Aces :)|pg||
nt|athene: if north shows a balanced hand south may go for the nine-trick game|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would, with 4333 and strength in all side suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Indeed|pg||
nt|hajru:  And then what?  You know that partner cannot have much and even if you set up a 4th heart, how can you cash it?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk5: I'd rather open 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D looks like an underbid if it isn't forcing|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: The trick is to avoid 3NT, and they did in both rooms. Well done|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: wd by both sides|pg||
nt|andyv:  E seems to have no problem in bidding with marginal hands|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@c = Gazzili. 2@d = 8+ hcp, 2@s = 5@h + 4@s 18+|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt could be a good hand, though, south might feel obliged to show the support in case they have slam|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 1nt with north, certainly|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pelu: as u understand, I dont agree with him :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Ricardo and Wubbo would u open 1@h or 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 3NT, have to bid.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  if north have A@c im hopeing to get inn on single @c K :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wboer: 6@c is a beauty, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|athene: another trick is to avoid 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why the double I wonder. He knows he will be on lead himself|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wboer: 4NT = NF, kanti|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed yes. with QJ@H falling.|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt - 3nt is a reasonable auction i think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wboer: quantitative|pg||
nt|athene: against diamonds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ah sorry|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I would rather be in 3nt than 4@S here, but they should make it either way|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|wboer: You have 11 toptricks with @c not 5/1. Enough entries to develop 5th @h or @dA good|pg||
nt|wboer: Well bid again by EW|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|wboer: I would open 1@h|pg||
nt|ricky86: i play 2@h 10-12 with 6 cards, but here i think is weak.. i don't agree|pg||
nt|ricky86: i would open 1 @h|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you have Ax of trumps you have to jump in with the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|athene: so as not to get endplayed later|pg||
nt|veistikke:  to cash the last @H :P|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: but i think west should be able to see that is not the issue on this hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: made easy.:)|pg||
nt|athene: not clear to run this because if you lose to west's queen, you just incurred an extra loser and you don't have anything so useful to throw on dummy's clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: even if he does, it's only an imp :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: and give N @Hj 10 and not the Q would u still open 1@h|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|athene: but one of the more embarrassing ones to concede|pg||
nt|athene: pitching a red card might be useful but it might not be|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: The only complaint I have regarding these youngsters is that they double (lead-directing) way too much. Most of the time it helps the opponents more than partner|pg||

nt|athene: and overcall 2@H over 1@H?|pg||
nt|athene: he does have a sixth heart|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: and some texture in his suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand is not good enough for that imo|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's close|pg||
nt|runnerup: a bit risky in this vuln..|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It takes more than a 9 count in my book|pg||

nt|athene: yes maybe pass is the right call|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: a spec says that with 6322 shape, 2@H is injudicious|pg||

nt|runnerup: in a way west was awake -to take @s ace -bad thing is that south doent need all those clubs and east has to side entry|pg||

nt|wboer: nothing to be ashamed off. Two aces in defense. This is better then a flat 12 hcp|pg||
nt|ricky86: y|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italian top guns hardly ever double, and there is a good reason for it|pg||
nt|athene: i think i have seen one of about eight that was useful for the defence|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, the French picked up 5 on the 4@s -1 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT making by South on 22 - 5 to France|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  our first slam|pg||
nt|pelu: so u open on 9+ - is that on your CC?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: better check my lottery numbers|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: I hears this beautifull 6@c will losse 2 imps, because the open room are in 6@h. With bare @hQJ this makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a very strong result for the Dutch|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: There are problem with running score - prob so many try to enter, that the server cant manage|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR board 8 the contract is 6@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For a start, you have to bid 3NT, and then make it if you do|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: does 1@C promise four clubs? rare these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: my cc is secret|pg||
nt|kakashi84: no 1@c promise 3 @c|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk5: I would upgrade to 10, so yes, 10-21 is on my CC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another double coming|pg||
nt|kakashi84: I think, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and then Poulat has to decide|pg||
nt|athene: west could have bid 3@D but he prefers to wait for his partner's second double|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  safest slam is 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would be lebensohl i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt is a reasonable punt|pg||
nt|bobholl: at other vulnarabilty he'd have passed i guess 98 are pretty :)|pg||
nt|athene: AK98 a lot nicer than AK87! one trick nicer in fact :)|pg||
nt|athene: guaranteed a double stop|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Did you give up on tournament bridge completely, Wubbo? We don't see you any more|pg||

pc|h9|nt|pelu: wd by EW there are 9 tricks|pg||

nt|pelu: kibs: lead @D :)|pg||
nt|wboer: I play the nice festivals in europe and some leage bridge in Holland Also coach/captain with my wife Agnes of this Dutch juniors|pg||
nt|hajru:  As I'm rooting for the Dutch, 16 flat boards is good for the result|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reasonable lead. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: normal lead|pg||
nt|wboer: There is a loosing option in 6@h after @dA and @d. Enter dummy with @d ruff to play for @hQJx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, we can see that it can be set, but it is very tough at the table|pg||
nt|athene: that's a vital tempo given away|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: imo @C lead in that hand would create problems for 6@H.|pg||
nt|hajru:  but I guess the specs don't like it. |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ricky86: shared lead but there isn't a problem for declarer|pg||
nt|wboer: @h lead will beat it. Taking @sA and @h switch will make life diff for decl. He still makes it because the block in @h|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: and now it's too late already|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: north, reasonably enough, excpected much better clubs for 3@C|pg||

pc|c4|pg||

pc|sT|nt|athene: south might underlead the hearts i suppose but that still nets only four tricks for the defence|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, I didn't really want to add that |pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|athene: that is a 1@H opener for most in this event, i suspect|pg||
nt|veistikke:  South can also duck the @H |pg||
nt|hajru:  Rehi, |pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  got disconnected but it looks as if I didn't miss much.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: After all, game is on a finesse|pg||
nt|athene: what will east rebid after 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 3@s?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  anyone got link to the results?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ricky86: Donati-Percario play a very good bridge for their age. I should mention that Donati is 13 yo and Percario is 16 yo :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East had @CJ instead of the 10, 4@S can be defeated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as it is, 5@C is a correct save|pg||
nt|athene: NS do well to "take the money" here since pressing on to 5@S would lead to a negative score|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: i would go for 2nt i think|pg||
nt|bobholl: now you misdescribe you hand always :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course, agonized pause and self-recrimination for opening in the first place is a reasonable option|pg||
nt|athene: and it looks as though east is going for that :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: What should N bid? Pass is ok imo|pg||
nt|athene: you might not be too happy taking a probable 500 against your vul game, but you don't want to go for "650 or maybe -100" instead|pg||
mb|2D|nt|wboer: strange but winning because @dA is wrong. Do they play a strong @c system?|pg||
nt|pelu: they prob play 2@S contructiv and he didnt like to bid 1NF (forsing - semiforcing)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: has no choice.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a very pure hand here and imagines short spades with partner so will sac i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: also 5@C takes blackwood away from north|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: because it uses up SO much room|pg||
nt|athene: when the auction gets icky like this, it's a good idea to favour the cheaper bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: but Australia need 19-11 to pass Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If they do, West'|pg||
nt|Walddk5: s hand is worth a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: which might be what he is about to bid|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qtournid=897&qphase=SF&qroundno=2|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, surprised|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be getting old - prefer 2@c to 2@d|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|warrens:  the other option is 2nt, which is tough on Jxx.  I actually don't like 1@H very much, unless playing a strong club.|pg||
nt|bobholl: which is 2NT but with Jxx i can't like that too :)|pg||
nt|athene: a spec comments that if you can't stomach 2nt, 3@S must be better than 3@H, which seems right|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 10@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Pity if partner had @CJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dan Neill|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hei and welcome|pg||
nt|hajru:  Hi Dan|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  that is good to know|pg||
nt|wboer: 3NT will make. N won't lead a @c|pg||
nt|ricky86: good contract 4@s but unlucky|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: 21-count 3NT - and it looks like it will make |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond to the ace, diamond ruff, club to the jack, diamond ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  5 clubs and 4 red suit winners.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|ricky86: they are the future of Italy bridge :)|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hajru:  N will probably run a C|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|veistikke:  5@c and 5@h and 1 @d :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and EW can't take three spade tricks, unless North misguesses - unlikely|pg||
nt|djneill:  seems like West can only hope that North has at most 5@c, 2@d, and one @h, so continuing diamonds might be best|pg||
nt|veistikke:  would be normal. but north is getting 11 if west continues inn @d |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|pelu: no update on running score after 3 boards of this match|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hajru:  That would give him something like xxx/AJxxx/AJx/xx and that is not a 2N rebid|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: in some situations like this, i think that opener's cue should not be strong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: it should just say "i have no bid"|pg||
nt|athene: typically a weak notrump with no stop|pg||
pc|s3|nt|djneill:  well North could have the @sK, but cannot establish it|pg||
nt|hajru:  South gives up ;)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c9|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I am asked what 'jettison' is. To throw overboard, usually valuable burdensome cargo, like fuel from an aircraft|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also used as a bridge term |pg||
nt|Walddk2: when you throw aces and kings overboard|pg||
nt|athene: NS in the other room obviously using 2NT as an artificial game force|pg||
nt|runnerup: south doent need much for a game here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: i first read about that in a book on Helgemo - maybe it is a norwegian invention|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|athene: i have to say i would open 2@C with the south hand|pg||
nt|athene: two-suiter or no|pg||
mb|3D|mb|5D|nt|runnerup: west is a good partner he has a support to his partner|pg||
nt|athene: "is AJ109x good enough for a 2-level overcall?" "it is when partner has KQxxxx"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The late Hugh Kelsey from Scotland would have called 3@D 'daisy-picking'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: true, but he came from a more rugged era, where any auction longer than 3 bids was counted effete|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: wow|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|athene: east doubling hoping that will get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: as clubs are (i suppose) dummy's suit, on the auction?|pg||
nt|athene: partner might have the @CK and you need to cash two clubs to beat this when declarer has a diamond void?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ligtner thougt west and rigth -now west is praying patrner doent have 6 @d|pg||

nt|wboer: Roland and Peter are right. E thought he would get to high when answering 2@s|pg||
nt|wboer: nice clow contract in open by japan|pg||
nt|hajru:  Great result for the dutch on that one.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S not so bad here but hard to find with two balanced hands|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ricky86: interesting hand now|pg||
nt|athene: west will super-accept spades i guess despite nasty 4333|pg||
nt|athene: you have to do something with 17 count and 4 trumps don't you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 17 with 4 is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW won't be nearly sure enough that 4@H is making|pg||
nt|athene: even if it gets bid, which is not certain|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 3@H in the other room was showing a good hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: wubbo; 2Nt?|pg||
nt|athene: then east will bash the game in|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: I can take a nap now|pg||
nt|athene: even if you play that 2nt is a scramble in that sort of position, you can still use that as "good bad" in the highest-ranking suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: which is very useful|pg||
nt|hajru:  Gazilli again, 2N showing a strong 5-5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards seem very NS this set, and to be fair NS are doing vey well with them|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: and down they will go :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich has a cleardouble now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4333 hands really ARE that evil|pg||
nt|djneill:  North asks for the 2nd suit, expecting @d...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wboer: 2NT is limit+ with @s support|pg||
nt|ricky86: construct?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here:)|pg||
nt|athene: because if south had a weak 3@H bid he would bid 2nt scramble and pull whatever his partner bid, to 3@H|pg||
nt|djneill:  but..|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Could be a Fantunes gadget, limit with 3|pg||
nt|athene: so a direct 3@H always shows something|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ricky86: bad choice bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d bit a bit over the top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that nowadays penalty doubles do not exist below 7@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quite sure no @C lead and @S guess will let it make|pg||
nt|athene: yeah you can get two clubs away on the hearts - but why should you play the spades right?|pg||
nt|bobholl: or no @C switch now |pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: Yes limit with 3 @s|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 3@S pretty much forces NS into 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything is for take-out. The doubles just have various names, but 'penalty' is not among them|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer doesn't have easy communication, but he can make this if S ducks|pg||
nt|athene: even if south flies the ace, it's not obvious to play a club|pg||
nt|athene: could look very silly a lot of the time |pg||
nt|warrens:  no, but another @D is sufficient|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer has the ace|pg||
nt|athene: yes, ace and diamond works ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: limit I can for sure see - and only 3 card @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  A of @D and a @H is dangerous for the defense|pg||
pc|cT|nt|djneill:  should South have just bid RKC after 4@h?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: yes - an "optional" double these days means "you can pull it to your suit, or to my suit" :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  He is close, I think.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|veistikke:  most people would have :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on this sequence, North does not guarantee four trumps, I imagine - South is 5/5+|pg||
pc|c3|nt|veistikke:  but 4@h is a good bid|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ricky86: another hand without story|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|veistikke:  nothing to play now :) 12 :P|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: should get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|athene: he knows west has a lot more diamonds than east|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  Now, declarer has to pitch 2 @C's and then play a @C to dummy |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hajru:  but doesn't have to make a foreward move on, say, xx/Qxx/Axxx/xxxx? over 3@h|pg||
pc|c6|nt|warrens:  ok, no miracles|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: is the @D8 discouraging in diamonds?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: west certainly doesn't want a diamond lead|pg||

nt|ricky86: the problems of these hands is stay awake :)|pg||
nt|pelu: here 2@S ask: do u have a opening hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You would also bid 2@H with one spade more and one diamond less|pg||
nt|wboer: In 6@s S has a natural @cQ lead for 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: not sure about "excellent", but "successful" it certainly is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is too funny for words if it is true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Optimism?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: and this West hand is considerably better|pg||
nt|athene: the italians do prefer opening the major on these|pg||
nt|djneill:  think it asks partner to bid your doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't know why they hate 1nt so much|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: exactly. Therefore this 2@s relay|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 6+ suit GF. 3NT = serious slamtry|pg||
nt|kakashi84: it's funny|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have 13 cards, partner, do you have a long suit?|pg||
nt|hajru:  Well, I do play X as @S and a 2nd suit, though I dont think I'd use it on this hand|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe :p my system it show same strenght|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: guess they play 12-16 rebid otherwise i don't understand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: they use gazzilli to solve some of the problems after 1M - 1NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, it's a partnership agreement issue|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|warrens:  so,did this sequence show an invitational hand by S?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: many flat bords here in 2. segment - in the other 3 matches max swing is 7 IMP|pg||
nt|wboer: I don't know if this is a good convention. You are good in the slamzone, but you tell much to defenders if you are in the limitzone|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yes, but I think you need it if you allow 3-card raises|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I do with a 5431 hand for example|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok East has a good idea where all the HCP are, esp since South did not lead a club (so North has a top club and @sQ)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: next please.|pg||
nt|athene: i am assuming this was a 2-way checkback auction|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like a reasonable way to overcome the problem|pg||

nt|bobholl: despite 26 points not so easy :)|pg||
nt|athene: @H10 comes down|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|wboer: 4NT = optional Blackwood. So 5@c=min, 5@d = 1/4, 5@h= 0/3, 5@s= 2 no @sQ, 5NT= 2 with @sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 8 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 400 is cheap|pg||

nt|kakashi84: -9 possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah, he has 2 tricks already, but was indeed possible|pg||
nt|athene: it's still not that huge a gain, but worth a lot psychologically|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: but still - if east leads a spade after the @HK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|warrens:  yes, with the J of @h's not, this should be easy|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: i guess you are ok|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: the defence might get the red kings and two spades but that is all|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c5|nt|warrens:  West just didn't have enough to X for a @S lead|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|pelu: 3 card raise for me only if i dont have a better bid - with Hx in @S and 3 card @H I bid 1NT every time|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ricky86: too much defeatist France here|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|warrens:  if W sticks in the 8 now, he can get endplayed |pg||
nt|athene: he can afford to take it though - the defence can't cash three more spades when starting from west|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk5: What do you bid with   x  Axx  AQJ10x  xxxx|pg||
nt|wboer: True, you should, but leading for opp is easier now.|pg||
nt|athene: he might simply run the hearts now and hope to endplay west in the pointed suits|pg||
nt|warrens:  whoops.  why wont North ever lead @C's?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: lead the @DQ was better|pg||
nt|athene: more likely to smoke out the king|pg||
nt|athene: if east doesn't cover the jack that doesn't mean much|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|warrens:  but the finesse is also reasonable, since now W has to cash out to prevent overtricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: well, south can't be called a passed hand, exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South is not a passed hand as such|pg||
nt|athene: he passed over 1@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: but might still have a good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But do you want to be in game opposite a passed partner is the question South must ask himself|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|wboer: Easy to bid and easy to make 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: is 1@S a forcing notrump here or is Hop just saying "anything you can do..."?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think East was a little quick with the @D 9.  did he think S led low twice from J10xxx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Its very close - 2@H could sill be a minimun 2-4-4-3 hand so 2@C for sure an option|pg||
nt|ricky86: nice hand here|pg||
nt|athene: i would overcall 1@s with the east cards|pg||

nt|athene: not sure how much more Bernard needs - probably not much|pg||
nt|warrens:  also, without @C's ever being led, it was likely that North had some @C honor|pg||
nt|veistikke:  should top the @d|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: some pairs swap the meaning of 1@S and 1NT in response to 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: most common is that 1@S can be up to 4 spades and 1NT is 5+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Kaplan inversion|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, I think declarer can assume @c AQ with S, @cK with N.  Otherwise S would have led one|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ricky86: good lead by S|pg||
nt|ricky86: almost unavoidable|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i'm told 1@S is indeed system not a psyche|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead should beat this i suppose|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 26 was flat - well done at the other table too |pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: declarer is going to just take the club finesse and lose the @CK and four spades|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|wboer: The double in the open room is not clever, although you have 2 tricks with (3rd hand) openend partner. You tell the opps to much.|pg||
nt|athene: he can run the diamonds first but that shouldn't put the defenders under much pressure|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|athene: we can see here that playing the diamonds doesn't achieve much, but in general, it's a good thing to do, if you don't need your solid suit for entries |pg||
pc|h5|nt|ricky86: yes, even in a mitchell i didn't bid dbl. too many informations for opp's and few aces :)|pg||
nt|wboer: The match is getting closer now. 10 tricks but -9 imp's|pg||

nt|athene: wow - this isn't at all the classic french style of pre-emption|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand, |pg||
nt|athene: another 1nt opener for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: Open 3NT in wrong hand. Can EW avoid this?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: and remember the 3NT - no play with @C first or sekund time - price 12 IMP!|pg||
nt|athene: i would have overcalled 3@c with the south cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: thin, but i have a 1@C opener, just about, and i am short in hearts so partner might be a bit stuck sometimes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice Roland 7@h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobholl: me too Jx and Qx are good cards to have|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: or 7@s, or 7NT, for that matter|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: snap|pg||
nt|rnmalik: played by W has a chance.|pg||
nt|wboer: No they can't|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ricky86: Delle Cave surely doesn't even thought to bid 5@d at board 11|pg||
nt|athene: south now wondering if this is just "equal level conversion" (he passes) or showing a really big hand (he might do something)|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like they play fast arrival, so 4@S shows a minimum|pg||
nt|hajru:  If you bid slams like that, you might as well go for 7N|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: buying it in 4@H in the other room was huge|pg||
nt|athene: but i would not bother with stayman with the east hand, probably - i would just bid 3nt|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: i like auctions that go 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: but than you get a @H lead :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, this sequence told the world that west has 4 spades and east has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt - 3nt, that's the way to go|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Even on a non-spade lead, 4@H was a lucky make|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk5: Needed diamonds to come in for 1 loser|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so sometimes the lead in your major was actually better for the defence|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wboer: E can lead a @c and then you have 10 tricks with the nice @d break|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why not 4@S and @D ace. A possibility.|pg||
nt|athene: but not so often|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

pc|c6|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|wboer: If you play like that then you have a sprained neck after a match because of peaking into opp cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: the dutch gaining heavily on the 3NT game here (they reached 4@H)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: E should play @da and @dq and west will make @c|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk5: This hand is probably too good for a 20-21 2NT. Let me ask KnR|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, the 2nt rebid worked out better|pg||
nt|bobholl: time for beer convention (3NT showing 5@S and 4@H ?) called when forgetting it you have to buy a beer)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: we have to counter the "i am at favourable" convention from east, first|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D is quite a bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|wboer: EW bid good and agressive again. 4@h makes!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: double swing. |pg||
nt|athene: 4@H looks normal with north|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: not a very good hand there - you know partner will respond in spades and you will have to rebid a mildly deceitful 1nt|pg||

mb|3D|nt|ricky86: swing for france at board 12. not perfect italy's bid|pg||

nt|kakashi84: what is it?|pg||

nt|athene: maybe west should bid 4@H to involve his pardy over 5@D, but i guess the fit showing jump is supposed to show east's hand precisely so west is in control anyway|pg||
nt|athene: many would raise to 2@S with the south hand, not promising a huge hand|pg||
nt|athene: just a courtesy raise|pg||
nt|athene: others say you need quite a few extras for it|pg||
nt|athene: the trend is to raise more|pg||
nt|athene: which i think is right|pg||
nt|athene: it just feels wrong to pass there after partner bid a free 1@S|pg||
nt|hajru:  Not sure what W is thinking about|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: and should not be trying to involve his partner any more|pg||
nt|athene: wow, very passive from west|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ricky86: flat hand here|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will need little encouragement to bid 4...the 9@s is a huge card|pg||
nt|wboer: Another small swing for Ned Juniors on the last board. So they will win comfortably. Congratulations to them.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Vugraphzmv: thanks, bye all|pg||
nt|kakashi84: he may think,he needs IMP|pg||
nt|athene: he's worried that south has four good hearts, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Interesting lead|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Trump fine, but surely a small lone, in case partner has the stiff queen or ace|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a brilliant slam, this - needs spades 3-2 or 4-1 singleton jack plus hearts for no losewr|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|Walddk5: *one|pg||
nt|ricky86: bye all|pg||
nt|hajru:  @cA lead and down 1|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  N didn't take advantage of the 9@s|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  this line of play gives N zero chances|pg||
nt|wboer: Tomorrow the semi final. I hope you join us again. I will, for sure. Thank you all and bye.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: north automatically plays a biggish trump spot (the @D7) to dummy's king|pg||
nt|athene: just in case he wants to lead to the 6 for an extra dummy entry later|pg||
nt|athene: this is really "declarer play auto pilot" for any experienced player|pg||
nt|athene: sure, he has two small diamonds in hand so he might not have needed to, this time - but that is not the point|pg||
nt|athene: in this sort of situation you reach for a "middling" card without thinking|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk5: Bye for now|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be a push i guess :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ricky86: bad playin by declarer. 9 of @s was his salvation|pg||
nt|athene: yeah, NS getting pushed up higher but making it anyway|pg||
nt|athene: ok thanks all|pg||
nt|bobholl: tya very much thanks bill cu next session|pg||
