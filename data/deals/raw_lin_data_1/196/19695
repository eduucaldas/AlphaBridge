nt|granguru:  even better|pg||
nt|dslee: 6@S john, why think of 61D|pg||
nt|granguru:  4-4 fit|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dslee: this is bad|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N was making on the lucky layout - 5@d also may make lets see|pg||
nt|dslee: thats why play in a contract which makes mostly , which is 3@D|pg||
nt|dslee: 3NT was very lucky- 4@H isnt|pg||
nt|psridhar: rt now Arvind must reason why his pd did not fit jump 3@H over 1@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@H has problems|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Precision might help E/W keep low|pg||
