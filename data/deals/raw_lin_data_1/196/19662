nt|athene: 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: wow.... |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D = apoyo @H mejor mano que apoyo directo|pg||
nt|gsper:  A modern style weak 2.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: this room is for turkish commentary|pg||
nt|atalok: slmlar|pg||
mb|3H|nt|minimeck: fireworks to start things off... here lankveld 6-4 in the majors blasts slam opposite bos' michaels, missing 2 cashing aces, |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H rechaza game|pg||
nt|exerdar: pass really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: it seems 4@sX -3 2@d 2@c 1@s and 1@h|pg||
nt|ferlema: 1@H double 2@D es tra to 2@H con un muy buen apoyo de 3 cartas|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hoþgeldin süleyman kolata|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: rare for auctions to die in 2 of a minor these days|pg||
nt|athene: but since neither side has a fit, i guess it's ok here :)|pg||
nt|athene: if east is really taking this long about his opening lead that tells declarer quite a bit about his hand i.e. he has a horrible hand to lead from!|pg||
nt|gsper:  That kind of bidding is supposed to call for trump lead, but here decl needs no ruffs.|pg||
nt|atalok: hbulduk paþam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: will likely find the shift here to set 6s, however, the other table, q@c lead allows 7@dx to roll home|pg||
nt|gsper:  Even less now.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ferlema: 2@S en el 3/3 interesante|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: 17 imps to ned juniors|pg||

nt|athene: reminiscent of the famous hand france vs usa in olympiad 1980s where hamman had to pick which ace was standing up|pg||

nt|exerdar: hi|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|galois85: bad return... now just -1|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: if you are worried that the contract might actually make, you don't lead the singleton|pg||
nt|athene: because the danger is it's a huge double fit hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed. never easy to lead from those kinds of hands :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d3|nt|minimeck: here with the club cooperating, will make by guessing the heart, now that is not a problem :)|pg||

nt|Walddk5: and Germ|pg||
nt|minimeck: Garcia Da Rosa and Crusizio are a very experienced pair, have played for a long time but this is their first international competition together.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this room is for turkish commentary thanks all :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kemperg: HI|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW should get too high in @H here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||
nt|athene: just lose the sixth club most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2c=d or majors|pg||
nt|minimeck: if any kibitzers have info about the NS pair, it is appreciated :)|pg||
nt|atalok: 2 tane genç milli takýmýmýz çeyrek final oynuyorlar.bana görede son derece baþarýlýlar ve ilerde A milli olacaklar var arasýnda.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you need to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mrdct: moysian 6@d here|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a big fan of that sort of thing though|pg||
mb|2H|nt|atalok: bazen saçmalýyorlar oda normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it helps if you can make unusual notrump bids later in the auction with confidence partner will know you are showing diamonds of course :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: nine tricks available in 3nt here with both kings onside :) |pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilk devreleri yaklaþýk 20 geride bitirdik ama toparlanmak için daha 32 bord var|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kdr_fm: will S just super accept spades or bid 4 ?|pg||
nt|minimeck: some difficulties here will be sorted out quickly|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|gsper:  3@H presumably something like 6-9 with both M.|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi henry|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2D GENERALLY FORCING|pg||
nt|minimeck: kib informs me NS also one of turkeys more seasoned pairs, finished 4th in the youth pairs last time in istanbul |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all|pg||
nt|minimeck: we should see some fine bridge today from these two!, |pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: 3nt extremely unlikely to be the best contract when you have such a shapely two-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt is for balanced hands and one-suiters|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, agreed, very suprising, especially if 3h was a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: good bidding NOT to be in 3NT:(|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Herkese hýrvatistandan selamlar|pg||
nt|atalok: 3 h  üzerine 4 sp daha iyiydi hem 4 lü fit hemde her renkte 1.tur kontrol göaterir|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ybob: un claro paso de W que será penalizado !|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|MolvaM: grandþlem diyebilmek için koz damý da olsa iyi olur ama muhtemelen þlemde dururlar|pg||
pc|d4|nt|galois85: it seems -1 by guessing the @dj |pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps the operator could inform us of the alerts|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might not realise they have any diamond fit at all - he might just think 2nt was showing a competitive 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES IT WAS|pg||
nt|athene: i would just rebid 3@D with the east hand, and if i get too high, so be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: west explained it could be weak with clubs or some good hands|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: ahora @D al K , J @D finesse y gana|pg||
nt|henryb:  now he will make 5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|minimeck: an immediate answer for the US, EW have bid to 6@d after a 3h overcall and 4d bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: uluer 5@h ile koz dam sordu sanýrým. doðunun 6c cevabý sanki koz dam bende dermiþ gibi geldi bana|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|mrdct: undo that - the @s hook and @c break are only good for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||

nt|germs345: especially juniors, they will always find something to bid when white on red|pg||

nt|moonbeam42:  EW managed to pitch away their @d stopper.  This will be a sizable pick up for Japan|pg||
nt|gsper:  Or all other leads are worse; not uncommon:)|pg||

nt|athene: and no reason to put north with a big diamond...|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: it is|pg||
mb|2N|nt|galois85: 2@d natural or weak fit |pg||
nt|exerdar: for running skores |pg||
nt|exerdar: very important advantage  in 10 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: spad or minors|pg||
nt|athene: the main advantage simply comes from opponents' unfamiliarity|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. what does double mean; what does the "cue" mean?|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: south didn't alerted|pg||
nt|minimeck: possible partial swing to turkey, multi by west on  3|pg||

nt|atabey: diðer masa 4@h kontrlu oynanýyo dedi seyirciler|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: but lack of entries to south's hand make it hard to make 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S in family with Guiseppe Failla, who played for the Blue team?|pg||
nt|minimeck: with qxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  clubs, as Edgar Kaplan said, were relegated to the trash heap in the 40's already. We don't bid no steenkin clubs|pg||

nt|exerdar: 3@H konturlu  ilginç bir el olabilir, hertürlü skora açýk görünüyor|pg||
nt|atalok: bence pas|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: 1@c = 16+ any shape, x by lean is exactly 6-7|pg||
nt|gsper:  But the Italians have sort of revived club slams.|pg||
nt|henryb:  clubs as natural, that is. See Gazzilli, Stayman, Drury|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, EW will pretend it started 1@C 1@H 1@S uncontested|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt is fair enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW trying for 3NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: lien*|pg||
nt|athene: north and south both downgraded their red queen under the bid suit i suspect|pg||

nt|athene: you might throw him in with a heart to lead a club|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, and that is where the open room has arrived, we shall see how it goes|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4@H looks like cold, but Uluer's need play carefuly , if he quess to AJ doubletone @d can make plus trick|pg||
nt|athene: west showed spades, and maybe south hasn't got any|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: but i think the defence should prevail |pg||

pc|sK|nt|Walddk5: After 10 rounds, top 8 advance to the quarter-finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|gsper:  Top honour, acc to another kib.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suspect it just showed an honor to tell partner it was safe to lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: that lead here will prove quite costly|pg||

nt|murat: after the lead it's intresting now |pg||
nt|murat: normally defence gets 3@h and a trump|pg||
nt|minimeck: although crusizio had a lead problem, spade feels like it is a passive lead, pretty risky in reality, |pg||
nt|murat: with the lead Uçar has a chance to avoid the trump lose|pg||
nt|minimeck: still not 100%, east could certainly have 109|pg||
nt|MolvaM: insanýn oðlunu 100lerce kiþi ile birlikte uluslararasý 1 þampiyonada izlemesi çok güzel|pg||

pc|s3|nt|pelu: 5@H: woid-wood - asking for Aces outside @h|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well done S I'd say many with that very good 15 count would double or try 3@d ,,, the 1NT warned him off|pg||
nt|minimeck: so some guesswork left to do :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tebrikler ve baþarýlar dileriz|pg||
pc|s9|nt|halila: another heart game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s loses a @d and a @c and possibly a @h depending on how you play that suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: a shoulder shrugging pass from dwyer, at these colors he expects a normalish opener from p, but still nothing to bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: same contract both tables should be flat|pg||
nt|rensph: If XX shows an honour, you shouldn't redouble with the queen imo. Don't want partner to have to guess whether to lead his AJxxx|pg||

nt|minimeck: or play for Qx of @s|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: i thought turkey was ahead before we crashed|pg||
nt|galois85: I think just good fit in spades invitational to slam. maybe dbl after 2@d shows hearts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Anybody knows NS methods against 1NT?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: but stripping @c and and easy endplay with guarantee 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: same 5@h in CR - and 5@s by N|pg||
nt|athene: three chances even - declarer has to knock out a lot of cards|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|minimeck: as he has done|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mrdct: so the plan will be to draw trumps, ruff a @c and then play @DAKx to endplay either opponent|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|nt|mrdct: can actually claim on this line after drawing 1 round of trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is always good fun|pg||
nt|minimeck: scores very tightly bunched in the Q-zone, with such a short qualifyer, alot of pressure on these players|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: teams were entered in the reverse way|pg||
nt|minimeck: still time to discard the heart losers by picking up clubs :)|pg||
nt|murat: east had a problem with the lead. heart lead is not an option. so only diamond lead does not hurt|pg||
nt|murat: he will go 2 off probably|pg||

mb|3C|nt|athene: borderline decision for west over 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: play 4@S or make a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|ybob: otro 3NT sin problema |pg||
nt|atabey: 5@d kuzey güneye ama bakalým neler olucak|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: S is in 3@HX on this board in the other room.... might get bloody|pg||
mb|3N|nt|halila: ý think it is wrongly written|pg||
nt|athene: now opener has room to bid 4@H to show a good hand for spades i guess|pg||
nt|athene: he has mostly "hard" cards, so he might do that|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C 3NT|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@s açýþ veya araya giriþ makul|pg||
nt|yusufb: 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: despite having only two spades|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to imagine a slam - but 4@H now might do the trick|pg||
nt|athene: east has a really huge hand, all the aces and a fifth heart|pg||
nt|gsper:  6@H is good here, but may go down in practice.|pg||
nt|atabey: 1@s ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS likely here|pg||
nt|athene: quite control-rish|pg||
nt|athene: rich|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKQ doubleton, which was the flaw when he opened, is suddenly worth a lot|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt looks a bit much, though|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: boring 4@S unless e/w find the 5 of a minor sac, 5@c being better (in 5@d @C ruff available)|pg||
nt|atabey: haha|pg||
nt|exerdar: gençler 3.den pas geçmiyor prensip olarak|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: INT TRANSFER TO CLUBS|pg||
nt|yusufb: 1nt transfer |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't see how you can go down in 6@H?|pg||
nt|athene: if double is penalty-oriented i really don't like it that much|pg||
nt|athene: but of course 4@H is a bit unilateral and might be very wrong|pg||
nt|gsper:  You are right, if the worst comes to the worst there is a squeeze on N.|pg||
nt|athene: can't you just ruff two clubs in the west hand?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Uruguay on the board after turkey let 3@s through on 4 |pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: apart from anything, the limited hand isn't normally the one to take control|pg||
nt|athene: not in well-controlled auctions anyway :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Bos will have to activate his sonar and find the diamond jack :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|atabey: pas geçmesin bu elle zaten de 1@s baya fantastik|pg||
nt|peyret: iyi atak|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kimse batýdan 3@h demeye kalkýþmamýþ. |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|halila: it can be down with a careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamonds 5-1 means the limit of hand is 1nt|pg||
nt|henryb:  Thanks, Matt|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  How could E not bid slam now?  He's gotta take at least a push now|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@s normal tek kotu taraf zon ters|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: interesting that NS put balanced 20-counts into their 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: what to bid in S - 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: and is 2Nt naturel or for minor?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see that he can know his partner has good values|pg||
nt|atalok: anca güney 1 ara 4 nt key kart sorarsa 5 h cevabýna mecburen þleme gelinir .|pg||
nt|atabey: burdan sonra ancak anlaþamayýp 6ya gelirler|pg||
nt|exerdar: evet ama @d9 olunca  sorun olmuyor|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W here could save the day by reaching and making 6@c|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4sp normal contract here|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, but decl may feel that that risks a defensive ruff.|pg||
nt|athene: why shouldn't west have the same shape without, say, the @HK?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk5: Is it necessary to jump to 4@H?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Academic now anyway.|pg||
nt|atabey: zon oynanamamalarý imkansýz|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: south may solve that problem for him at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: difficult - i guess if you want to be passive, a trump lead is preferable|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea tough lead problem for lien, trump club, diamond?|pg||
nt|minimeck: trump seems the safest, not going to pick off pard with q@s :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you operator, yes, :) k@h not possible|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: diamond might well find partner's honour for them; i like a trump here, although you don't usually lead a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: @HK into a 2nt opener....hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but 3|pg||
nt|athene: as a rule, it's right to lead aggressively against 6 of a suit, but this auction might be an exception|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt on here, but probably hard to bid|pg||
nt|atabey: ay ay ay|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h looks doomed, though - No Roland, its not.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I think with all controls and 5 trumps, you shoudl at least have 5 level safety|pg||
nt|minimeck: turkey is a very talent rich country for players at all levels of competition, can you tell us anything about the EW pair at the other table murat?|pg||
nt|murat: yes sure|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mrdct: the @h7 is a big card here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt better than 3@C - West can get 2@d ruffs|pg||
nt|galois85: yes... 2nt I think is natural|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this would slowly end up in 4@S. ..  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - where did East get that 3@H from?|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason you would lead a heart is to set up a trick fast before declarer throws heart losers on a side suit|pg||
nt|exerdar: pik çýkmassa kötü|pg||
nt|atabey: kontr çok haksýz deðil. iki as kýsa pikle|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3@s dbl pik çýkma idi , karýþtýrýyorlar hep|pg||
nt|atabey: pik çýkarsa da 6 olur|pg||
nt|yusufb: anlaþmalarý var ve cok zayýf acýyolarsa idare etmek lazým rakip baraja degil cue ederek bilerek isteyerek zon soyledi|pg||
pc|cT|nt|minimeck: lools like 11 tricks likely here|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, definetely merit to leading the heart|pg||
nt|atabey: 650. allahtan beyazda|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: that is unlikely to be the issue here|pg||
nt|gsper:  And NS in 3@H at other table? Sounds like the Menagerie.|pg||
nt|henryb:  only if both tables make the contract :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: @D8: signal for @s|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Diamond switch may be needed now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: To force declarer|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk5: All academic with the 1400 from the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now he can win in dummy and take the club finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|halila: a flat bord|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting methods but the normal contract non-theless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: exactly four spades|pg||
nt|athene: there is some merit to this sort of thing, the idea being to conceal from the defenders whether declarer has four hearts|pg||

mb|2C|nt|pelu: IF i was forced to bid I would X - but a clæear pass for me|pg||

nt|galois85: maybe 4 spades and a club I would think about bidding a dbl (maybe I would not...but was possible) but in this situation easy pass|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally it would show precisely 4, but especially when the 1@D can be short, you want 1@S as a general t/o without spades|pg||

nt|henryb:  Ah, pass cards are issued at age 30 in Holland. Well I'm glad my Senior team will have access to them in Veldhovn|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: north probably worth 2@H now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Pass in 3rd at favourable would be a psyche|pg||
nt|athene: also, if you actually have 3nt on, beating 1nt by a lot of 50s isn't much compensation|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i doubt south will get over-excited|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3@C puppet or baron or stayman anyone know ?|pg||
nt|minimeck: spec properly points out they have a specialized system here for this, 2nt not 18-19 as standard, some sort of unbalanced forcing hand|pg||
nt|murat: i believe this 2NT has 3 meanings|pg||
nt|atalok: sürlerdim|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW will go for the vul game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: how many times i have to say made|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3c should buy the pot|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if puppet south now knows the opps have 10 hearts between them (3NT normally denies a 4CM)|pg||
nt|athene: however, this way they miss 3nt|pg||
nt|minimeck: we shall see where it leads, 6@c pretty much ice cold baring 5-1 hearts and the singleton having a club|pg||

pc|cT|nt|mrdct: but no joy with @DAJ10 and @HK offside i think|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C alerted i suppose because he had good/bad 2NT available|pg||
nt|athene: they didn't ditch that even after the board 2 disaster :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 club invitationa|pg||
nt|minimeck: votes for 2@s in third seat? worked effectively in the open|pg||
nt|minimeck: pushed them to 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3nt only denies majors|pg||
nt|gsper:  He probably would have missed 3NT if he had passed too.|pg||
nt|atalok: anca dogu açarsa 1 d rakip 1 sp sonra 3 nt ya gelinir|pg||

nt|peyret: 9 lovemiz var umarim alabiliriz |pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: south is not really good enough to cue bid, but maybe ok in their style|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be able to get the @s loser away on a @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not enough|pg||
nt|mrdct: this hand is a good illustration of why 4333s are worth -1hcp|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree seems the normal bid, |pg||
nt|kemperg: let them escape|pg||
nt|athene: yes, probably|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ugis: 3nt has no chances|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: unless you have some very convenient agreement|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be no trouble now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: diamond ruff coming|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to attack dummy's long suit, though|pg||

nt|ybob: k@C A@C y triunfo ?|pg||
nt|ugis: while 4h would have been much more realistic|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Takes a heart shift to beat it|pg||

pc|h4|nt|pelu: tell me: why lead @D4 from J 10 9??|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|animeshraj: he did venture,, brave bid !...... but not recomendeD LOL :) at 5332 and that suit that V.|pg||
nt|athene: like, passing over 1nt and then bidding 3@D later after north transfers, shows a solid diamond suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk5: The defence can't afford that declarer gets a diamond trick|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@D was 4 down|pg||
nt|gsper:  It seems that N psyched at the other tabe.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and so did East|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I don't believe he passed|pg||
nt|kemperg: no|pg||

nt|athene: ok, they are running out of time|pg||
nt|minimeck: last chance :/|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is going to throw a diamond on the @HA if you don't get a move on|pg||
nt|athene: south knows his partner has some big card in a minor|pg||
nt|athene: but is it @CK or @DA?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|MolvaM: Board 20 will be the last for this set. there will be a lunch break now. next match starts 14:30 CET|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|exerdar: hmm  a lead problem, e-w playing  to 3@s dbl =anti lead but still doesn't |pg||
nt|ugis: in 4h, after club lead, declarer must be very carefull and lead a spade in the second trick|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: if the former, he would be more likely to lead a diamond when in earlier|pg||
nt|minimeck: seems south has to conclude it is his only option, wd|pg||

pc|c6|nt|kdr_fm: likely to clear hearts and trumps and then play @dA and another|pg||

pc|s3|nt|minimeck: you'd have to look in his secret files to which i don't have access|pg||
nt|athene: the trend at the top level is to open 1nt more and more on the "middling strength" 5422 and even 5431 hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the end, a flat board to finish us out|pg||
nt|athene: because it simplifies things|pg||
nt|minimeck: specifically also with stiff k|pg||
nt|athene: lots of ways you run into trouble opening, for example, 4-5-2-2 15 count with 1@H|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Thanks operator|pg||
nt|animeshraj: gd sac agst a making 3@C.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i bet 2@C would get the most votes in a bridge world poll|pg||
nt|minimeck: can't blame north for doubling for the spade lead, but doubling freely bid games for the lead like this, is not without risk as we see here|pg||
nt|minimeck: the theory being you're almost sure they aren't gonna make overtricks, if they win 4 imps by making exactly 9, so be it, but the spade lead could produce a 12 imp win|pg||
