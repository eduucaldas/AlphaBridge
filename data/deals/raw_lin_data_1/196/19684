nt|Walddk4: our operator is Giusy|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  S will open|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last segment of this semi-final, and a close match|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  no multi apparently|pg||
nt|kakashi84: DBL is minor 5 and 4 in major|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ricky86: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N has a 3@d bid available for lead directional purposes|pg||
nt|andyv:  E dbl is responsive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Woolsey convention, also known as Multi-Landy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolsey_(convention)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The modern trend is to open the North hand 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2-2 in the majors and a 6-card minor not unusual nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's fine with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I have also seen it misused|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hop still thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either he passes or doubles, but it should not take that long|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You there Giusy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TD has been summoned I am told|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: For what we don't know yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ricky86: welcome to this 2nd session of quarter final|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 1NT is presumably some sort of conventional bid|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|athene: hello everyone good afternoon|pg||

nt|mdgraham: cards lie quite well for this |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henk Uijterwaal|pg||
nt|hajru:  Hi all|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rashed and Wubbo|pg||
nt|wboer: hello. nice match here|pg||
nt|wboer: joris v lankveld started well by ducking the @c twice|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Takes a @d switch here to have a chance.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E would have to run @Hs from the top.|pg||
nt|wboer: he has to guess the @h|pg||
nt|kakashi84: no yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah, 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 140+100|pg||
nt|kakashi84: but Q@h @h and @h 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he can ruff a club first|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes, but I thinked 300|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and take a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes I know|pg||
nt|kakashi84: 3 @h and 2@s on lead and 2 down, now one down|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: The lead has marked South with @HAK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: has no choice left but to cash AK@H and make.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d7|nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so it is now safe to finesse diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North must have the king|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||

nt|athene: so no reason to expect anything but a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if the double fits get discovered, there might be a lot of bidding here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|4D!|an|!D/!S|mb|5H|nt|athene: 4@D "non-leaping michaels" i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: showing a decent hand with at least 5-5 in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: many people feel that it's much more use to be able to show these 5-5 hands than make a natural 4 of a minor overcall|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: because with a natural diamond single-suiter you can do OK doubling or bidding 3nt or bidding 5 of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: hi all pictures from Opatija http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143 !/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|athene: this convention was first used over an opposing weak two, so e.g. 2@H 4@D would be north's hand|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: one down on the diamond ruff - but not obvious|pg||

nt|athene: interesting hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: !|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this can make 3NT EW|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: this slæam is better :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Weak 2 or 5/4+?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C for NS - will EW sac with two aces?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ricky86: of course :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showing hearts i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: and that will not delight south|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think i would want to stress the hearts with north|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: is 4@H now a cue bid or re-transfer?|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 5@s-4+ in a minor 5-10hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is practical bridge, I'm all for that|pg||
nt|athene: he has more a balanced hand with scattered strength, than a heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: but i imagine 1nt was not available (probably showed clubs)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hajru:  This will probably end in 3N, making |pg||
nt|mdgraham: always depressing to see partner pass as delaer when all you hold is three jacks |pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: raising clubs might work well now|pg||
nt|athene: people rarely do that, though, in this day and age|pg||
mb|5S|nt|hajru:  2@d is GF checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: maybe re transfer|pg||
nt|athene: :(|pg||
nt|athene: well north will go 4@C or 4@S now|pg||
nt|athene: *south sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will NOT cover @D10|pg||
nt|mdgraham: chioces would seem to be 2NT or 3@c  |pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: east thinking about a diamond sac?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: 5@h??|pg||
nt|ricky86: 5@h?|pg||
nt|wboer: Good lead. @cK and @s switch is diff for decl|pg||
nt|athene: takes a club lead to beat 6@S i guess?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: This is the last round in the Swiss - 8 best to KO - Japan no 7 with 152 and Australia 1 + 2 + France No 8 with 145|pg||
nt|athene: stops declarer cashing one spade then finessing|pg||
nt|athene: because you don't have the entry to dummy when you need it|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Poulat has one more to play, diamonds are 4-3 and no worries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a duck caters for a 5-2 split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2nT presumably denies three spades, and also four hearts|pg||
nt|hajru:  I think so.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi all pictures from Opatija http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143 !/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||

nt|athene: with the idea of getting in with the @DA to cash it|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: but that would need partner to have @CKQx or something like that|pg||
nt|athene: not too likely for a weak-two opener|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: sorry a 3@H opener|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|athene: east perhaps simply reasoned that his partner would be certain to lead a singleton diamond, so the club was the only chance left|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@D two-way checkback, so just a game-force|pg||
nt|athene: more commonly used over a notrump rebid but it works just fine here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C would be a puppet to 2@D (i.e. it would force opener to bid 2@D) then north can pass that or make some invitational bid|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: they're happily on their way to 6@D, by the look of it|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even 7@D|pg||
nt|athene: some artificiality here i am sure|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S probably something devious|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think south should be the one bidding blackwood|pg||
nt|athene: north must know more about south's hand than the other way round|pg||
nt|athene: but ok|pg||
nt|athene: assuming 5@D was 0/3 keys|pg||
nt|athene: now south wants to know ok, what else ya got?|pg||
nt|athene: 5@H would ask for the @DQ, i assume|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|athene: so 5@S is the next step up asking about side kings|pg||
nt|athene: if they do reach seven it will be an interesting play exercise in percentages|pg||
nt|athene: but you can't go down on any rational line|pg||
nt|athene: i like the other room auction|pg||
nt|athene: with north taking control|pg||
nt|athene: i assume north is wondering how to show the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: simply bidding it in "specific kings" fashion is pointless because 6@H forces you to 7@D anyway|pg||
nt|athene: he might just bid the grand|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: and indeed he does|pg||
nt|athene: well done|pg||
nt|athene: grand slams are one thing which really separate the top teams out|pg||
nt|athene: they put a lot of effort into getting these hands right|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: casual players tend to be more lazy about grand slams but at this level, if it's there, you want to be in it|pg||
nt|athene: the two main options are to ruff the hearts good, or to throw the @C9 on a spade and ruff spade and club in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i would think declarer will go for the first option|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: of course if trumps are 2-2 you just claim|pg||
nt|athene: so he will start with two trumps from hand i imagine|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: now probably a third trump, because it would be a pity to go down when west had a singleton heart|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: and then @HAK and claim when both follow|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|c3|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome to lovely opatija|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we are having some of the warmest days of the year|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rnmalik: no comments please.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the 5 IMP - in B2 EW stopped in 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess he was playing for e to be 5/5 in the blacks.|pg||
nt|athene: now if it goes 1@S - 1NT from EW, south can't really double, as that is t/o of spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: 5@c = min, 5@D = 1/4, 5@H = 0/3, 5@s = 2+@sq + tx Wubbo|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: ty :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wboer: but the @dQ holds the trick so east had the @dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT? looks odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich will pass and Lebatteux can't really bid again|pg||
nt|athene: north can bid 2@D now |pg||
nt|hajru:  I think they play Gazilli (1M-1N-2@c) for strong balanced hands, freeing up 1M-1N-2N for special hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told Gazzilli, strong 5/5....thanks|pg||
nt|hajru:  I guess N will bid 3@c and S will specifiy|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2@D or 2NT in S being non-vul or pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wecan see that 2NT is makeable, but there is a risk that declarer goes wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N has decisions now|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hajru:  4@c cuebid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it would not be good to get to slam here |pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: Opatija fotos http://www.facebook.com/pages/WBF-Youth/263033693726143?sk=wall|pg||
nt|wboer: some partnerships play 2NT as good/bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has to guess which finesse to take, and if he chooses spades, he must guess who has A and Q|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: i think this is a bit of a sucker double from south in fact|pg||
nt|athene: north clearly has a hand too weak to raise diamonds over 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: and that is a very weak hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|athene: say, 2 points or so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you might well beat 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not a sure thing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the straightforward bid, but 2H could also be effective, with the plan of bidding 4D if partner  bids 3N at some point|pg||
mb|5S|nt|wboer: 2NT in S for the minors was not poss, because west opened 1@c|pg||
nt|athene: your spades are not exactly well-placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would get the idea of promary diamond support across while emphasizing hearts|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  E can create some opportunities by playing the A@s and @s|pg||
nt|kakashi84: good morning|pg||
nt|athene: and east didn't have to bid 2nt|pg||
mb|6D|nt|Walddk2: I am impressed if he gets this right|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: here is looks as if 4N was RKC. many top class pairs use a different call than 4N for KC in the minors, because there is insufficient space between 4N and 5 of the trump suit. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: various forms of this method ar e called "kickback" or "redwood" or other labels. it is a very good idea in principle, but it is essential to have firm agreements on which call is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: KC and WHEN that call is KC|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  on 3rd @s, N will ruff with K@h and finesse for Q|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is a very good example of what s.j. simon talks about in his book|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy 11 tricks - should be flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: "why you lose at bridge"|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Wubbo de Boer, world champion 1992|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: he gives a hand almost exactly like this|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|andyv:  E not aware of hand's potential|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1993, sry|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|wboer: So good/bad 2NT in west meaning a compatative weak 3@c bid with 6-card suit. 3@c in stead off 2NT = 14-16 hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If hearts are 5-2, he could have won the first trick and endplayed East with a heart after a few rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N does not know which black king S has, so it may seem that 7D is a dangerous risk. in my view it is the correct call, though, because:  a) S might have heart queen     b)  S might ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have spade king -- he is about a 60% favorite to have that king rather than the club king        c) S might have S jack in which case it is a five-or-seven hand anyway|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: However, that would look silly if East started with six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: east putting in the @HJ at trick 1 forced him to commit himself immediately|pg||
nt|athene: much easier if east plays ace and a heart|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|athene: and says if you double the opps in 2nt or even 3nt , don't be too surprised when it makes|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|athene: when you have all your side's assets, the defence does not go well|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wboer: hi all, nice to see my Dutch juniors doing so well|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: but u didnt like @h2 :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can expect to be squeezed and endplayed a few times :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|wboer: he should ruff the @c and a @d for 10 tricks|pg||

nt|athene: if east turned up with a singleton heart you would be down but that's extremely unlikely when he has only one trump|pg||
nt|athene: if west has the singleton heart you are fine as the ruffing finesse becomes marked|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so the grand is almost 100% once west has at least two trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north could have bid 2@H over 2@D if that was michaels|pg||
nt|athene: many play it as just a takeout double of hearts but i think michaels might be better|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|d|nt|athene: "scrambling" 2nt, saying "Pick a minor"|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: very useful convention|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: whenever partner doubles 2 of a major, and you don't want to leave it in but you don't know what to bid, you bid 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: and let partner sort himself out|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you really need to do this, rather than just guess which of your suits to bid, when the double can be a bit offshape, as here|pg||
nt|athene: it's the best call on hands like this but also things like 4-3-3-3 shapes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: lucky not to get doubled in this|pg||
nt|athene: i would double 3@H with the south cards at MP for sure|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: at imps, you are a little more wary about doubling partscores|pg||
nt|athene: you want them to be TWO down, not just one down, as with MP|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|athene: the defence shouldn't have too much trouble coming to @DK, @CAKQ, @HK and a spade ruff|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||

mb|p|nt|ricky86: 5 imps to japan|pg||
nt|athene: actually i am not sure the endplay was so useful anyway because when east cashes the hearts, dummy gets squeezed anyway|pg||

nt|athene: because if trumps break 3-1 and the clubs lie over you|pg||
nt|athene: the defence may be able to play a third trump and stop you ruffing more than one club in dummy|pg||

mb|4H|nt|pelu: and not Ws style :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3-level overcall on AJ9xx is againt my religion|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes 3@c isn't a good bid, but he knows his part can't reopening and he thinks he must bid|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wondering about the likelihood of north having @DJ10?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Five hands in a row for South to declare |pg||

nt|santyclz: 3@c is a big bid for that hand.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wboer: 3NT is high but has play if @d are 3/2|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you can guarantee to keep south off lead, your best chance of a double stop in diamonds is to rise the @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to cut down on ruffs against the likely 44 fit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: and this one is comfortable as well|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ricky86: a good choice 3nt when you have few points and two balanced hand|pg||

nt|santyclz: Needs to take the @s finesse quickly...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared that Hop had clubs stopped|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: in the other room declarer got a heart lead, played a diamond to the queen himself, and then ran the clubs, and the defenders threw enough things that he felt confident about ...|pg||
nt|athene: trying a small spade for some overtricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a riveting deal, but even juniors have some quiet boards|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: missed that chance. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|ricky86: S didn't guess the 2@c a friendly play :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's play of A@c was predicated on the need for him to run 9 tricks immediately|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pelu: now West will win on a endplay|pg||
nt|wboer: That is good play. With this @s break he can make it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ruffing declarer's loser with a natural trump trick.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S had no good choices there.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|wboer: If S played a @s (best) then N still could be endplayed in @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's so easy for us when we can see that there was no danger in this contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: @S10 (std) bit costly sometimes|pg||
nt|athene: upside down carding is just better|pg||
nt|athene: if you have 10x playing std you are better off just not giving count, most of the time; even high from 9x can be costly quite often|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|athene: but a better way to play is to use some form of serious 3nt (maybe serious 3@S over hearts)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|pelu: @HJ the problem - in Cr S tryed @h9 but also @S here - only @h2/3 will give the message to N|pg||
nt|andyv:  you need to pick up the @s suit...only play that will do that is the J@s lead from S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think 3@D can achieve so much|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: might just get partner off to the wrong lead against hearts|pg||
nt|athene: north might double this for takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@S now - as in OR|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his side has slightly more than half the deck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D might be short, so maybe West cannot raise to 2@D (could be inverted) |pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: if partner has a heart stack there could be a number on offer|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@s probably shows 4@s|pg||
nt|ricky86: shows 4 @s and a maximum hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same lead in OR.|pg||
nt|athene: in situations like this where it's overwhelmingly likely that the opponents are going to play it, your bids should probably be mostly lead-directing|pg||
nt|athene: mostly you expect pd to pull it but that will hopefully be ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, he feels that south bidding spades or diamonds is too likely, and too likely to be wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: perfect EW distribution, but with only 8 HCP difficult for W to invite for slam|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hajru:  1@d as 3+ in standard French style?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: for me S sh pass over 3@s x - 4@D for extra values and no @S-stop|pg||

mb|d|nt|andyv:  I wonder if 2@s is a one round force|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Absolutely one sided match so far.|pg||
nt|oosb: but without the dbl -400 actually gains against 650!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marginal opening bid by W, the French establishment might frown on it so perhaps not opened in the other room?|pg||

nt|hajru:  You're not looking at the other table, are you?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no, just this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@C/5@D will cost 300 against 4 major, but with all green u normal not go for this save - but sometimes u can push opp to 5-level!!|pg||

nt|marlowepi: largely Dutch team. this kind of ecumenical transnationalism is very good for bridge |pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk5: Indeed|pg||
nt|hajru:  And then what?  You know that partner cannot have much and even if you set up a 4th heart, how can you cash it?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk5: I'd rather open 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D looks like an underbid if it isn't forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The trick is to avoid 3NT, and they did in both rooms. Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by both sides|pg||
nt|andyv:  E seems to have no problem in bidding with marginal hands|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@c = Gazzili. 2@d = 8+ hcp, 2@s = 5@h + 4@s 18+|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt could be a good hand, though, south might feel obliged to show the support in case they have slam|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 1nt with north, certainly|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: as u understand, I dont agree with him :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Ricardo and Wubbo would u open 1@h or 2@H?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 3NT, have to bid.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  if north have A@c im hopeing to get inn on single @c K :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: 6@c is a beauty, but diff to bid|pg||
nt|athene: another trick is to avoid 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why the double I wonder. He knows he will be on lead himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: 4NT = NF, kanti|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed yes. with QJ@H falling.|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt - 3nt is a reasonable auction i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is itching to double, but the spectre of -470 is a forbidding vision|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: quantitative|pg||
nt|athene: against diamonds?|pg||

nt|warrens:  yes, I would rather be in 3nt than 4@S here, but they should make it either way|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|wboer: You have 11 toptricks with @c not 5/1. Enough entries to develop 5th @h or @dA good|pg||
nt|wboer: Well bid again by EW|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|oosb: lively auction here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wboer: I would open 1@h|pg||
nt|ricky86: i play 2@h 10-12 with 6 cards, but here i think is weak.. i don't agree|pg||
nt|ricky86: i would open 1 @h|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you have Ax of trumps you have to jump in with the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|athene: so as not to get endplayed later|pg||
nt|veistikke:  to cash the last @H :P|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: but i think west should be able to see that is not the issue on this hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: made easy.:)|pg||
nt|athene: not clear to run this because if you lose to west's queen, you just incurred an extra loser and you don't have anything so useful to throw on dummy's clubs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: even if he does, it's only an imp :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|pelu: and give N @Hj 10 and not the Q would u still open 1@h|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||

nt|athene: pitching a red card might be useful but it might not be|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only complaint I have regarding these youngsters is that they double (lead-directing) way too much. Most of the time it helps the opponents more than partner|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W would have done better not to double 2C. he is dead minimum for an opener (if that) and his clubs are not all that great  -- and meanwhile  2C is the contract that suits ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him best|pg||
pc|c6|nt|oosb: Yes but after 1NT dbl, he perhaps expected 2@H to be dbled too?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should perhaps have led a trump, and W should perhaps have switched to diamonds at trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but is it so clear that he wants to defend 2HX rather than 2C undoubled?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

nt|oosb: that's a good question :)|pg||

pc|dK|nt|ricky86: a litttle bit aggressive but Donati was right here. @h lead maybe would create a problem for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: E led clubs in response to the double of 2C, but that means EW have the side suits locked up, so a trump is attractive  --  E would surely be ruffing clubs with natural trump ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tricks. the  danger in a trumop klead is slight. NS are surely in a 52 fit, and even if NS do have AKJ the trick will probably come back|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ricky86: well played|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||

nt|hajru:  As I'm rooting for the Dutch, 16 flat boards is good for the result|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reasonable lead. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: many players would open 2N on the S hand, but that would be ill-advised on a hand that is so well-sculpted for play in a suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: normal lead|pg||
nt|wboer: There is a loosing option in 6@h after @dA and @d. Enter dummy with @d ruff to play for @hQJx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, we can see that it can be set, but it is very tough at the table|pg||
nt|athene: that's a vital tempo given away|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: imo @C lead in that hand would create problems for 6@H.|pg||

pc|dT|nt|athene: north, reasonably enough, excpected much better clubs for 3@C|pg||

nt|athene: this might seem an odd-looking gadget|pg||
nt|athene: but many top pairs play it|pg||
nt|athene: the reason is, if the auction goes, say, 1@C - 1@S; 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: then (if you are not a passed hand) you want 2@H now to be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so if you have a weak hand with 5-4 majors you are not strong enough to do that|pg||
nt|athene: and you can miss a heart fit when partner is minimum with 5 or 6 clubs and 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem here is that fifth heart is worth a lot|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ricky86: Donati-Percario play a very good bridge for their age. I should mention that Donati is 13 yo and Percario is 16 yo :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East had @CJ instead of the 10, 4@S can be defeated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as it is, 5@C is a correct save|pg||
nt|athene: NS do well to "take the money" here since pressing on to 5@S would lead to a negative score|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many french players have various calls available as opener to distinguish different types of raises to 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would go for 2nt i think|pg||
nt|bobholl: now you misdescribe you hand always :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course, agonized pause and self-recrimination for opening in the first place is a reasonable option|pg||
nt|athene: and it looks as though east is going for that :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wboer: What should N bid? Pass is ok imo|pg||
nt|athene: you might not be too happy taking a probable 500 against your vul game, but you don't want to go for "650 or maybe -100" instead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and in other lands too as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: strange but winning because @dA is wrong. Do they play a strong @c system?|pg||
nt|pelu: they prob play 2@S contructiv and he didnt like to bid 1NF (forsing - semiforcing)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: has no choice.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a very pure hand here and imagines short spades with partner so will sac i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: also 5@C takes blackwood away from north|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: because it uses up SO much room|pg||
nt|athene: when the auction gets icky like this, it's a good idea to favour the cheaper bid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: but Australia need 19-11 to pass Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If they do, West'|pg||
nt|Walddk5: s hand is worth a strong club|pg||
nt|athene: which might be what he is about to bid|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qtournid=897&qphase=SF&qroundno=2|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: ok, surprised|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be getting old - prefer 2@c to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|warrens:  the other option is 2nt, which is tough on Jxx.  I actually don't like 1@H very much, unless playing a strong club.|pg||
nt|bobholl: which is 2NT but with Jxx i can't like that too :)|pg||
nt|athene: a spec comments that if you can't stomach 2nt, 3@S must be better than 3@H, which seems right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect that the vulnerability here has been an inhibiting factor. for example, at favorable colors N (though not a french N) might overcall 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 10@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Pity if partner had @CJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dan Neill|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hei and welcome|pg||
nt|hajru:  Hi Dan|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  that is good to know|pg||
nt|wboer: 3NT will make. N won't lead a @c|pg||
nt|ricky86: good contract 4@s but unlucky|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi|pg||
pc|d6|nt|oosb: good contract with the double fit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: 21-count 3NT - and it looks like it will make |pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Diamond to the ace, diamond ruff, club to the jack, diamond ruff|pg||
nt|hajru:  5 clubs and 4 red suit winners.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ricky86: they are the future of Italy bridge :)|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hajru:  N will probably run a C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though there is some work to do|pg||
pc|hA|nt|veistikke:  5@c and 5@h and 1 @d :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and EW can't take three spade tricks, unless North misguesses - unlikely|pg||
nt|djneill:  seems like West can only hope that North has at most 5@c, 2@d, and one @h, so continuing diamonds might be best|pg||
nt|veistikke:  would be normal. but north is getting 11 if west continues inn @d |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: no update on running score after 3 boards of this match|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|hajru:  That would give him something like xxx/AJxxx/AJx/xx and that is not a 2N rebid|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|athene: in some situations like this, i think that opener's cue should not be strong|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: it should just say "i have no bid"|pg||
nt|athene: typically a weak notrump with no stop|pg||
pc|s4|nt|djneill:  well North could have the @sK, but cannot establish it|pg||
nt|hajru:  South gives up ;)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|wboer: This will be 9 or 11 imp's back to japan|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: the trump play is more or less clearcut , when opps have ten diamonds and never bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: let's say for example you open 1@D, 1@S overcall, 2@H from your pd|pg||
nt|veistikke:  now 12|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: nice try - but no succes|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|oosb: +1|pg||
mc|11|nt|oosb: 4 more boards in the first session of this final. Total 4 sessions of 14 boards each|pg||
nt|oosb: or is it different for 3/4?|pg||
nt|oosb: 3 sessions I'm told since this is 3rd/4th |pg||
nt|oosb: Ah and the room title reads 1/3 dohh|pg||
nt|oosb: Are they taking a break?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this has been a relatively quiet match so far, for this age group...only a couple of big hands|pg||

nt|athene: in which case east had a 2@S bid and then they might get to 4@H|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@D some sort of cunning relay|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe asking partner if he has a real hand (when 3nt might be there) or whether 3@C was just a little joke|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: well this is all very odd|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: so the first false step from netherlands|pg||
nt|athene: i think looking for 3nt is against the odds with that north hand|pg||
nt|athene: it might make sometimes|pg||

nt|wboer: Roland and Peter are right. E thought he would get to high when answering 2@s|pg||
nt|wboer: nice clow contract in open by japan|pg||
nt|hajru:  Great result for the dutch on that one.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S not so bad here but hard to find with two balanced hands|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ricky86: interesting hand now|pg||
nt|athene: west will super-accept spades i guess despite nasty 4333|pg||
nt|athene: you have to do something with 17 count and 4 trumps don't you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 17 with 4 is enough|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: EW won't be nearly sure enough that 4@H is making|pg||
nt|athene: even if it gets bid, which is not certain|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 3@H in the other room was showing a good hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|oosb: Ferro and Scanavino stopped in 2NT on board 9, while the other table in the final also played 4@H-2|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: wubbo; 2Nt?|pg||
nt|athene: then east will bash the game in|pg||
nt|oosb: is it just me or the 1NT overcall is scary?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: I can take a nap now|pg||
nt|athene: even if you play that 2nt is a scramble in that sort of position, you can still use that as "good bad" in the highest-ranking suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: which is very useful|pg||
nt|hajru:  Gazilli again, 2N showing a strong 5-5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards seem very NS this set, and to be fair NS are doing vey well with them|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and down they will go :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helmich has a cleardouble now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4333 hands really ARE that evil|pg||
nt|djneill:  North asks for the 2nd suit, expecting @d...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wboer: 2NT is limit+ with @s support|pg||
nt|ricky86: construct?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here:)|pg||
nt|athene: because if south had a weak 3@H bid he would bid 2nt scramble and pull whatever his partner bid, to 3@H|pg||
nt|djneill:  but..|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk5: Could be a Fantunes gadget, limit with 3|pg||
nt|athene: so a direct 3@H always shows something|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ricky86: bad choice bid 5@d here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d bit a bit over the top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that nowadays penalty doubles do not exist below 7@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quite sure no @C lead and @S guess will let it make|pg||
nt|athene: yeah you can get two clubs away on the hearts - but why should you play the spades right?|pg||
nt|bobholl: or no @C switch now |pg||
nt|oosb: One probably cant afford to pass but against a passed pd it is scary|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wboer: Yes limit with 3 @s|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 3@S pretty much forces NS into 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything is for take-out. The doubles just have various names, but 'penalty' is not among them|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer doesn't have easy communication, but he can make this if S ducks|pg||
nt|athene: even if south flies the ace, it's not obvious to play a club|pg||
nt|athene: could look very silly a lot of the time |pg||
nt|warrens:  no, but another @D is sufficient|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer has the ace|pg||
nt|athene: yes, ace and diamond works ok|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: limit I can for sure see - and only 3 card @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  A of @D and a @H is dangerous for the defense|pg||
pc|c2|nt|djneill:  should South have just bid RKC after 4@h?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: yes - an "optional" double these days means "you can pull it to your suit, or to my suit" :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  He is close, I think.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|veistikke:  most people would have :P|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on this sequence, North does not guarantee four trumps, I imagine - South is 5/5+|pg||
pc|h4|nt|veistikke:  but 4@h is a good bid|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ricky86: another hand without story|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|veistikke:  nothing to play now :) 12 :P|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: should get the diamonds right|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|athene: in the other room, south did not have room to ask for the @HQ, i think|pg||

nt|athene: or did it go 3@S P P 4@H?|pg||
nt|kakashi84: no?|pg||
nt|athene: north keeps not opening these hands 1nt :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H psyche is possible there|pg||
nt|kakashi84: may be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the surface you make slam with this fortunate trump split, but a diamond lead puts an end to that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent psyche if it is|pg||
nt|bobholl: the old problem with 15-17 and 5 high :)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  whats the dbl?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: board 26 next in the Open Room. That result could be vital|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this time only one suit for slam|pg||
nt|pelu: our friend from japan could jump to 3@H in OR|pg||
nt|wboer: I think !2s asks for number of @h, shape and strength|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Not a gross overbid|pg||
nt|ricky86: the problems of these hands is stay awake :)|pg||
nt|pelu: here 2@S ask: do u have a opening hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You would also bid 2@H with one spade more and one diamond less|pg||
nt|wboer: In 6@s S has a natural @cQ lead for 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: not sure about "excellent", but "successful" it certainly is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is too funny for words if it is true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Optimism?|pg||
nt|oosb: straight forward 6@H here, |pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|oosb: although|pg||
nt|oosb: with KQ@H missing they might not bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors i think S should bid it, especially since he has chosen to sue KC|pg||
nt|oosb: Is a 7 card fit though, but could be missing AQ@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: use|pg||
nt|oosb: I meant 9 card fit|pg||
nt|oosb: 7 card suit!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view, if he bids 5H here, he is saying he wanted to be in slam only if facing AK|pg||
nt|oosb: I guess it depends to some extent on preempt styles too? vul against not 3@H might be on the heavy side and atlesat have a decent suit?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|Walddk5: and this West hand is considerably better|pg||
nt|athene: the italians do prefer opening the major on these|pg||
nt|djneill:  think it asks partner to bid your doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't know why they hate 1nt so much|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: exactly. Therefore this 2@s relay|pg||
nt|wboer: 2@s = 6+ suit GF. 3NT = serious slamtry|pg||
nt|kakashi84: it's funny|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have 13 cards, partner, do you have a long suit?|pg||
nt|hajru:  Well, I do play X as @S and a 2nd suit, though I dont think I'd use it on this hand|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe :p my system it show same strenght|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: guess they play 12-16 rebid otherwise i don't understand|pg||
nt|oosb: Well judged in the end|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: they use gazzilli to solve some of the problems after 1M - 1NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, it's a partnership agreement issue|pg||
nt|athene: but those are not problems that you need in the first place :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|oosb: 75% or so to pick up trumps?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|warrens:  so,did this sequence show an invitational hand by S?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: many flat bords here in 2. segment - in the other 3 matches max swing is 7 IMP|pg||
nt|wboer: I don't know if this is a good convention. You are good in the slamzone, but you tell much to defenders if you are in the limitzone|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk5: Yes, but I think you need it if you allow 3-card raises|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I do with a 5431 hand for example|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok East has a good idea where all the HCP are, esp since South did not lead a club (so North has a top club and @sQ)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: next please.|pg||
nt|athene: i am assuming this was a 2-way checkback auction|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like a reasonable way to overcome the problem|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: go lebatteux!|pg||
nt|bobholl: despite 26 points not so easy :)|pg||
nt|athene: @H10 comes down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|wboer: 4NT = optional Blackwood. So 5@c=min, 5@d = 1/4, 5@h= 0/3, 5@s= 2 no @sQ, 5NT= 2 with @sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 8 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 400 is cheap|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes it's good|pg||
nt|athene: ...and laughing at every 50, as we used to say at university|pg||
nt|kakashi84: -9 possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah, he has 2 tricks already, but was indeed possible|pg||
nt|athene: it's still not that huge a gain, but worth a lot psychologically|pg||
nt|kakashi84: yes|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: but still - if east leads a spade after the @HK|pg||

nt|ricky86: good lead by S|pg||
nt|ricky86: almost unavoidable|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: i'm told 1@S is indeed system not a psyche|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead should beat this i suppose|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 26 was flat - well done at the other table too |pg||
nt|marlowepi: E should reflect that he has subpar trumps and W did not cuebid 4D, so W may be taking a shot with 5C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: declarer is going to just take the club finesse and lose the @CK and four spades|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, I think N did well to bid over 2@c from S.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless EW have agreements to the contrary, W could bid 4D then 5C to show slam-friendly values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, one understands the powerful temptation to bid six -- that will be a good contract facing as little as:    x    xx    Axx    xxxxxxx|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wboer: The double in the open room is not clever, although you have 2 tricks with (3rd hand) openend partner. You tell the opps to much.|pg||
nt|athene: he can run the diamonds first but that shouldn't put the defenders under much pressure|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: very agressiv X by N in OR - spec when up with a lot|pg||
nt|pelu: sometimes down 1, but N cant exp down 2, so the D only a help for decl|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: interesting neither south player bid 2nt|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|athene: maybe they felt their offence-defence ratio was not good enough|pg||
nt|athene: with empty suits and @SK likely to score on defence|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: i wonder if south thinks 3@C was lebensohl (showing good hand)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the cards lie very well for declarer in 3nt and that might have come home|pg||
nt|athene: win spade lead and play ace and a club|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C will be touch and go|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i certainly would not have doubled it with the west cards|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|athene: the double gains one imp vs. 3@C|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: (you gain 5 instead of 4)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|athene: and risks to lose a lot|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: i am slightly surprised north pulled 3nt x actually|pg||
nt|athene: maybe with such an empty heart suit he just felt his hand wasn't going to be any use in 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: but surely south was not counting on hearts to be their trick source|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d5|pc|c3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: oops|pg||
nt|athene: it's ok to let people ruff with natural trump tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but you mustn't let them ruff TOO often|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|cK|nt|athene: then they get an extra trick |pg||
nt|athene: for example if a defender has QJx trumps|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: it's fine if he ruffs once|pg||
nt|athene: but if he gets TWO ruffs that costs a trick|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzmx: bye all|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so maybe the double was not so bad :) i still think it was risky|pg||

nt|hajru:  Well played by N but he eventually ran out of high cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: france has hope for a swing there|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  board 11 proved to be very expensive as 4@s failed in OR|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is a good Dutch result|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NED RUM on a roll against ARG URU in the other semi-final, now 32 up|pg||
nt|athene: wow - this isn't at all the classic french style of pre-emption|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: interesting hand, |pg||
nt|athene: another 1nt opener for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: Open 3NT in wrong hand. Can EW avoid this?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: and remember the 3NT - no play with @C first or sekund time - price 12 IMP!|pg||
nt|athene: i would have overcalled 3@c with the south cards|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: thin, but i have a 1@C opener, just about, and i am short in hearts so partner might be a bit stuck sometimes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice Roland 7@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: me too Jx and Qx are good cards to have|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: or 7@s, or 7NT, for that matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|wboer: very good result in open room. 4@h is down with a @s ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Can 4@H make on a spade lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: snap|pg||
nt|rnmalik: played by W has a chance.|pg||
nt|wboer: No they can't|pg||
mb|p|nt|ricky86: Delle Cave surely doesn't even thought to bid 5@d at board 11|pg||
nt|athene: south now wondering if this is just "equal level conversion" (he passes) or showing a really big hand (he might do something)|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like they play fast arrival, so 4@S shows a minimum|pg||
nt|hajru:  If you bid slams like that, you might as well go for 7N|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: buying it in 4@H in the other room was huge|pg||
nt|athene: but i would not bother with stayman with the east hand, probably - i would just bid 3nt|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: i like auctions that go 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: but than you get a @H lead :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, this sequence told the world that west has 4 spades and east has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt - 3nt, that's the way to go|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: Even on a non-spade lead, 4@H was a lucky make|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: south was a bit wet there, i think - pass first time, give pd a single raise and then subside?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Needed diamonds to come in for 1 loser|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so sometimes the lead in your major was actually better for the defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wboer: E can lead a @c and then you have 10 tricks with the nice @d break|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why not 4@S and @D ace. A possibility.|pg||
nt|athene: but not so often|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: NS favorites to make 3N|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: it has to be right in the long run not to tell them so much|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ricky86: good def by EW|pg||
nt|pelu: can u makle 2Nt now? better take the first @C and play @hs - then u can overtake @SQ - run the @Hs and play @d|pg||
nt|ricky86: yes, was better taking with ace on lead|pg||
nt|hajru:  The French bid 6@h on 27, off 2 aces.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: back to OR: strange lead - East cant expt that his partner has a fast entry, so dont play for ruff, play for ruff to partner|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: the diamond lead restricts declarer's options in 4@S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure why he overtook that club|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: well, he makes six if the clubs run|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: gets both spades away in time|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|athene: now he just crossruffs and claims 5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: losing trump, @SA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|c8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: hoping east doesn't ruff this|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: ok, doesn't hurt to make them defend correctly :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|marlowepi: odd that N ruffed D before drawing last trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: france has almost drawn level now on the two slam hands  --  NEDRUM somewhat surprisingly stayed out of the good slam on  12 in the Open Room, and France stayed out of the failing ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam on  13|pg||
