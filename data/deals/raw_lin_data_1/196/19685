nt|psridhar: i think they play 2@s as 4 card raise and 3@D as 5 card raise|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psridhar: both 9-11|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d6|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 3@d surely cud not be 5/6-11 hcp|pg||
nt|psridhar: but the hand plays well bcos of @c 3-1 with no wastage|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|nkgupt: so he passes w/ 6 and 5/6 cards?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|dJ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h9|mc|11|nt|psridhar: precision - pass when u see no game , thats the name of the system NK|pg||
nt|nkgupt: i sure see a game there|pg||
nt|psridhar: he also did thats why he bid|pg||
nt|nkgupt: and the dec will confirm that:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: opener could not visualise those 3 small @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: tough call|pg||
nt|nkgupt: not after suggested 2@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: interchange the blacks in West and see|pg||
nt|psridhar: 109X,QX,AJ10XX,KXX also 2@s rt?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 2@s is not 5@d yet|pg||
nt|psridhar: now 3@d is high enuf|pg||
nt|psridhar: unless opener bids his @s fragment u cant reach 5@d and if he does that and W has @c king it is risky...dilemma alright|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3@s takes them to 4@d when Suhas holds @c king and minus country|pg||
nt|psridhar: but IMP players are generally optimistic in game bidding i agree|pg||
nt|psridhar: so some pairs WILL reach 5@d here|pg||
nt|psridhar: bye|pg||
nt|nkgupt: i wud expect 7*13=90 loss for missing that game in a 14 table field|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: again after 5 mins|pg||
