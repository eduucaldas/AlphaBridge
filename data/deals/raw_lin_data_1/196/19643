nt|vugraphzmw: HEART SHOWS SPADES HERE|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: Hola :)|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  For live results, you can go here: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ferlema: hola Bobby|pg||
nt|ferlema: que alegria|pg||
nt|ybob: que tal Fernando :)|pg||
nt|ybob: un placer|pg||
nt|ferlema: bien gracias :)|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C perhaps denies three spades, hence alerted|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|minimeck: wow.... |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D = apoyo @H mejor mano que apoyo directo|pg||
nt|gsper:  A modern style weak 2.|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: fireworks to start things off... here lankveld 6-4 in the majors blasts slam opposite bos' michaels, missing 2 cashing aces, |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H rechaza game|pg||
nt|exerdar: pass really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: it seems 4@sX -3 2@d 2@c 1@s and 1@h|pg||
nt|ferlema: 1@H double 2@D es tra to 2@H con un muy buen apoyo de 3 cartas|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: rare for auctions to die in 2 of a minor these days|pg||
nt|athene: but since neither side has a fit, i guess it's ok here :)|pg||
nt|athene: if east is really taking this long about his opening lead that tells declarer quite a bit about his hand i.e. he has a horrible hand to lead from!|pg||
nt|gsper:  That kind of bidding is supposed to call for trump lead, but here decl needs no ruffs.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|minimeck: will likely find the shift here to set 6s, however, the other table, q@c lead allows 7@dx to roll home|pg||
nt|gsper:  Even less now.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|ferlema: 2@S en el 3/3 interesante|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|minimeck: 17 imps to ned juniors|pg||
nt|gsper:  And a 4@H I would not have dared.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: reminiscent of the famous hand france vs usa in olympiad 1980s where hamman had to pick which ace was standing up|pg||
pc|c5|nt|exerdar: amazing 200  versus 7@d |pg||
nt|exerdar: hi|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|galois85: bad return... now just -1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|athene: if you are worried that the contract might actually make, you don't lead the singleton|pg||
nt|athene: because the danger is it's a huge double fit hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed. never easy to lead from those kinds of hands :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Rens|pg||
nt|rensph: hi all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 1@c strong or something else ?|pg||
nt|exerdar: showing 2plus cards i quess|pg||
mb|1C|nt|gsper:  But it worked nicely.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Germ|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|kemperg: HI|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW should get too high in @H here.|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: many would open 1@D with the east cards so they can rebid clubs conveniently|pg||
nt|athene: just lose the sixth club most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2c=d or majors|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you need to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the tables are not linked|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: moysian 6@d here|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a big fan of that sort of thing though|pg||
mb|p|mb|d!|nt|athene: it helps if you can make unusual notrump bids later in the auction with confidence partner will know you are showing diamonds of course :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: will S just super accept spades or bid 4 ?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|gsper:  3@H presumably something like 6-9 with both M.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C 33, 3NT is on|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi henry|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 3nt extremely unlikely to be the best contract when you have such a shapely two-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt is for balanced hands and one-suiters|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, agreed, very suprising, especially if 3h was a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: good bidding NOT to be in 3NT:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: was 2NT just general good/bad?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: wow 4@S by N is abit much - even with the fortunate lie in D this is unlikely to make|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ybob: un claro paso de W que será penalizado !|pg||
nt|ferlema: la defensa debe tener cuidado en no bloquear el corazon|pg||
nt|gsper:  I did not expect to be that much right.|pg||
nt|guillemin: bad lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: 6NT right sided here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrdct: quite a lucky make with @c 3-3 and @sK onside|pg||
nt|ybob: es necesario tomar y continuar para derrotar|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|galois85: it seems -1 by guessing the @dj |pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps the operator could inform us of the alerts|pg||
nt|athene: if so, west might not realise they have any diamond fit at all - he might just think 2nt was showing a competitive 3@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: YES IT WAS|pg||
nt|athene: i would just rebid 3@D with the east hand, and if i get too high, so be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: west explained it could be weak with clubs or some good hands|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: ahora @D al K , J @D finesse y gana|pg||
nt|henryb:  now he will make 5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|minimeck: an immediate answer for the US, EW have bid to 6@d after a 3h overcall and 4d bid|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|mrdct: undo that - the @s hook and @c break are only good for 10 tricks|pg||

nt|minimeck: maybe some temptation here to save on "anything" at these colors, but even for juniors would be a stretch|pg||
pc|hA|nt|germs345: As Matt said earlier, big match between the USA teams for a qualifying spot|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|minimeck: with the group so tightly bunched with only 1 spot close, expect these teams to take some chances|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|minimeck: Australia 1 being among them|pg||
nt|minimeck: will likely need 21ish vp to get the spot|pg||
nt|minimeck: for those asking, top 8 teams q for the KO|pg||
nt|germs345: 5@h doubled here may have escaped for down 3 and a 4 IMP potential pick up|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|minimeck: teams like ned RUM would be more than happy to play 10 flatish boards|pg||
nt|minimeck: clever pllay on words their team name, with two from netherlands and two from r(o)mania :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see that for a US team to qualify, one of them will have to beat the other soundly. Seems like it was a bad idea for them to play each other this round|pg||
nt|germs345: NED RUM is in 5th going in to last round, so as long as they keep steady they are in a very good position|pg||
nt|minimeck: i am pretty confident they didn't have a choice henry, but you are correct :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s8|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|minimeck: neither will want to lose to the other, and it may lead to them playing conservatively and a close score|pg||
nt|minimeck: france signaling early intend with a big early lead over ned juniors, very hard to catch up in these races|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or, because they need to win big, some swinging|pg||
nt|germs345: exactly what i was thinking|pg||
nt|germs345: theyre will probably be some interesting results from that match|pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile, Milne waiting a bit to draw trump :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be a formality when the k appears|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: ma è a livorno?|pg||

nt|ferlema: en la mano 1 Sur no solo mostro su fuerza con 2@D si no que además sobre el segundo doblo redobló|pg||
nt|ybob: el mejor fit es en @S pero dificil ovbiar el @H|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  EW managed to pitch away their @d stopper.  This will be a sizable pick up for Japan|pg||
nt|gsper:  Or all other leads are worse; not uncommon:)|pg||
nt|athene: there was no reason on that hand to suspect that declarer was going to throw diamond losers away fast on a side suit|pg||
nt|athene: and no reason to put north with a big diamond...|pg||
nt|athene: so diamond lead is dubious i think|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously had a good hand so there was lots of time for him to get in and play diamonds|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: good day|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: even with @ss 4-0 4@S sh make|pg||
nt|minimeck: on a power distribution hand like that,  would hate not to be able to show it in some shape or form |pg||
nt|gsper:  Do they play forcing 1NT?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 50% contract I suppose was fair enough but would have passed with N hand|pg||
nt|gsper:  Sounds persuasive.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|MolvaM: Championship page http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/Opatija11.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: not alerted 1 nt|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 4@h a chance here for EW|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: 1 or 2 more imps for japan here|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: 3 CARDS |pg||
nt|rensph: not quite forcing but you tend to bid on|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: tough call - lousy spade suit 4333 defensive hand vul do you want to balance ... who knows|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: I MENA 2 SPADES SHOWS 3 CARDS|pg||

nt|exerdar: e-w started very good  in first boards|pg||
nt|rensph: range 6-11 or so|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Can a woman be semi-pregnant? No, either she is or she is not, and either a bid is forcing or it is not|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|galois85: Dbl  at first round shows 4@s+ 1@s is a sputnik dbl without spades ( of mancinelli I mean)|pg||
nt|pelu: was 2@S forcing? - or an underbid?|pg||
nt|ferlema: debería perder una baza por palo|pg||
nt|henryb:  means partner can pass with balanced 11-13, but can bid 3 card minor with constructive hand, Roland|pg||
nt|gsper:  Sounds much like Culbertson and Goren played it.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, no, not Goren, who played 1N as 6-9|pg||
nt|gsper:  OK, 3-card minor rebid is not Culbertson either.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mrdct: japan came 3rd in the asia-pacific championships in kuala lumpur in june so have qualified for next year's world youth championships expect to be in cuba|pg||
nt|galois85: underbid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: juniors are normalt not afraid of bidding, but for sure Mancinelli is :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: THEY'RE DISCUSSINE EAST DENIES 4 CARDS SUPPORT IN SPADE|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk5: I don't buy that Henry. So you pass with KQxxx  Axx  xxx  Kxx  where you can be cold for 4@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|exerdar: but look like they lose  a game  here|pg||
nt|gsper:  4@H obviously does not make. Perversely, I think 3NT would hava had a chance.|pg||
nt|athene: north had a cunning plan:- give his partner some heart ruffs|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk5: take a card away from a minor|pg||
nt|henryb:  down to 20%, and that only with misdefense: needs @hA onside doubleton and that N doesn't give a ruff with the @hA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Look, Roland, I don't make the rules, I only tell it like it is. You may not like the treatment, but that does not give you license to say it does not or should not exist|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ybob: apresurado jugar triunfo y tomar de A por Este|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Animesh|pg||
nt|henryb:  Me, I play a 1N response is non-forcing but wide range|pg||
nt|gsper:  How many down would 4@D have been?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: west's double was helpful to opponents|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west had far too many clubs for a lead in that suit to be productive|pg||
nt|kemperg: so do I|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu: Andrea, can u tell us about the players - I exp that the 2 italian teams here are 2.. 3. or 4. best?|pg||
nt|galois85: well of course the singleton  in the first suite of his partner seems a bad distribution, but after knowing that the king of hearts maybe is well placed and the 4cards fit of my ...|pg||
nt|galois85: partner I surely bid 4... |pg||

nt|minimeck: and alas next* hand|pg||
nt|germs345: the USA match|pg||
nt|minimeck: the excitement is building, if only we had hollywood style dramatic music to acompany us|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|germs345: yet another partscore deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|minimeck: a spectator points out italy appears to have recieved a .5 VP penalty (presumably for late arrival) one would hope that doesn't cost them a spot|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would choose 2@d rather than 1N|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree henry, rates to be a partial hand and 2d better than nt|pg||
nt|germs345: so would I, but I think Souths hand is worth a 1@h overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|minimeck: yes, very very conservative by radu|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: should be ok in 3@d here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  problem with this auction is that (to my eyes) it sounds encouraging, not signoff|pg||
nt|minimeck: for those clicking on specific tables in the live results, the aren't exactly 100% live, they update the boards as input every few minutes, will get a few boards at a time|pg||
nt|germs345: I think he can even afford to misguess one of the red suits and still make this|pg||
nt|henryb:  to my ears it would look encouraging :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|minimeck: agree, west gave it a second look|pg||
nt|minimeck: that lead will simplify things here|pg||
nt|minimeck: not sure of west NT range, a normal 1nt opener for many wests|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|minimeck: and a doubled partial now on the board for USA U-21, now 13 to the good and 1 behind france|pg||
nt|henryb:  Many of us old timers do not like 5-4 1NT, and with 4@s and 5@c there is really never a rebid problem|pg||
nt|minimeck: our wonderful viewgraph operator explains 1nt EW is 14+ to 17, west decided against it on his shape|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|minimeck: i know that if i didn't open that 1nt, i would be put in timeout :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  If Paul, my son, opened 1N I would put him in timeout. One of many differences between me and your father|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|minimeck: lol :) well said|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|germs345: 1@c would probably be the favorite at a local club or sectional, but i expect most of the juniors to open this hand 1NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: deliberate play by EW here, they know what's on the line|pg||
nt|minimeck: can use either clubs or hearts to get back to his hand here|pg||
nt|henryb:  Two matches ago I predicted it would take 164 VP to qualify, and it looks like I was spot on|pg||
nt|reisig: FIRST time :)|pg||

nt|athene: pretty much all hands with a six card suit are a game try after pardy raises|pg||
nt|ybob: los nervios del VG|pg||
nt|kemperg: no, I can bid 1NT or 3@H |pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk5: 3@H fine and what if you belong in 6@C?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 6@c on lets see if they get there|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 7@d bid on board one very well done and +15 imps|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt opener possible with west|pg||
nt|athene: of course you have an easy rebid with 4-5 black suits but even so|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|mrdct: 2@s for NS and maybe 3@d for EW here|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  With the same defense, it looks like Japan will pick up 3 imps|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont like the quality of th @Hs|pg||
nt|henryb:  tough|pg||
nt|athene: it's getting more common to simplify things with 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H some cunning bid, maybe "spades or minors"|pg||
nt|athene: this is something i think we will see more of in the future - tricky defences to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: it is|pg||
mb|d|nt|galois85: 2@d natural or weak fit |pg||
nt|exerdar: for running skores |pg||
nt|exerdar: very important advantage  in 10 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: spad or minors|pg||
nt|athene: the main advantage simply comes from opponents' unfamiliarity|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. what does double mean; what does the "cue" mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: anyway east calls td because wasn't clear explained on front page of cc|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: to be fair the hands did fit extremely well|pg||
nt|athene: it was very hard to diagnose that|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, bos' 2@d call seems to have disuaded him enough |pg||
nt|exerdar: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: dbl shows hearts|pg||
nt|athene: hearts are the one suit north can't hold; i don't know if south's pass suggests playing there anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: south didn't alerted|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: but lack of entries to south's hand make it hard to make 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S in family with Guiseppe Failla, who played for the Blue team?|pg||
nt|minimeck: with qxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  clubs, as Edgar Kaplan said, were relegated to the trash heap in the 40's already. We don't bid no steenkin clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Right, dump Stayman|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: dbls getting lighter and lighter every year ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: north neither|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  If 2@D is now 4th suit, E has a real problem.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|minimeck: 1@c = 16+ any shape, x by lean is exactly 6-7|pg||
nt|gsper:  But the Italians have sort of revived club slams.|pg||
nt|henryb:  clubs as natural, that is. See Gazzilli, Stayman, Drury|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, EW will pretend it started 1@C 1@H 1@S uncontested|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt is fair enough|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: EW trying for 3NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: lien*|pg||
nt|athene: north and south both downgraded their red queen under the bid suit i suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: I think the son|pg||
nt|athene: but this downgrading is overdone i think|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you are talking: Gazzilli!|pg||
nt|kemperg: in my system 1@C is 3+, 1D also3+, but more @D than @C|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Dbl lets him get out to @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: la voz de 2@C va a ser utilizada para invitar sobre el sin triunfo|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzmw: yes, he his|pg||
nt|ybob: no entiendo para que hacer stayman |pg||
nt|animeshraj: time to avoid.. 4H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: yo tampoco, pense que iba a invitar con 2NT|pg||
nt|ybob: se ganan con esta salida|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: no hay forma de perder |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that lacks vision 2@h is a jump good hand and must have 5+@c - in that context S has a very good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: u see I know almost more than u :):):)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2nd x here just t/o|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be a quiet 110 here|pg||
nt|kemperg: we dont miss many minr contracts that way|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, South may bid a @d slam, but N will correct|pg||
nt|athene: north might now find it hard to bid 2@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: played by west on a @s lead might be OK|pg||
nt|galois85: =)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: giuseppe is now responsible for youth  in italy|pg||
nt|pelu: hard job|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt interesting on small heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: five rounds of diamonds give east a few worries|pg||
nt|athene: you might throw him in with a heart to lead a club|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, and that is where the open room has arrived, we shall see how it goes|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4@H looks like cold, but Uluer's need play carefuly , if he quess to AJ doubletone @d can make plus trick|pg||
nt|athene: west showed spades, and maybe south hasn't got any|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but i think the defence should prevail |pg||
nt|ferlema: si, estan todas las cartas bien puestas|pg||
nt|ybob: aún no acertando el @D|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Not sure what 3@c is. |pg||
nt|animeshraj: MAYBE @D's trf oe something like that|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 clubs alerted both sides|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's not automatic for him it seems|pg||
pc|s4|nt|galois85: Giuseppe is also watching the match at this table|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Yeah, maybe|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mrdct: as it happens a passive @d lead may have been best to let declarer do all of the work|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gsper:  Why the jack?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: why not 3x@H and then @D?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|minimeck: treating the hand too strong for a 1nt opener, the inevitable contract, a chance for a well deserved pickup|pg||
nt|henryb:  The play will be quicker than the bidding|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|pelu: 5@H: woid-wood - asking for Aces outside @h|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|halila: another heart game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s loses a @d and a @c and possibly a @h depending on how you play that suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: a shoulder shrugging pass from dwyer, at these colors he expects a normalish opener from p, but still nothing to bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: same contract both tables should be flat|pg||
nt|rensph: If XX shows an honour, you shouldn't redouble with the queen imo. Don't want partner to have to guess whether to lead his AJxxx|pg||

pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: i thought turkey was ahead before we crashed|pg||

nt|gsper:  Anybody knows NS methods against 1NT?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mrdct: but stripping @c and and easy endplay with guarantee 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: same 5@h in CR - and 5@s by N|pg||
nt|athene: three chances even - declarer has to knock out a lot of cards|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|mrdct: so the plan will be to draw trumps, ruff a @c and then play @DAKx to endplay either opponent|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|kemperg: in a @C contract, see discussion before:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: borderline decision for west over 2nt|pg||
nt|athene: play 4@S or make a mild slam try?|pg||
nt|ybob: otro 3NT sin problema |pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: S is in 3@HX on this board in the other room.... might get bloody|pg||
mb|3C|nt|halila: ý think it is wrongly written|pg||
nt|athene: now opener has room to bid 4@H to show a good hand for spades i guess|pg||
nt|athene: he has mostly "hard" cards, so he might do that|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C 3NT|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: despite having only two spades|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to imagine a slam - but 4@H now might do the trick|pg||
nt|athene: east has a really huge hand, all the aces and a fifth heart|pg||
nt|gsper:  6@H is good here, but may go down in practice.|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS likely here|pg||
nt|athene: quite control-rish|pg||
nt|athene: rich|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKQ doubleton, which was the flaw when he opened, is suddenly worth a lot|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt looks a bit much, though|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: boring 4@S unless e/w find the 5 of a minor sac, 5@c being better (in 5@d @C ruff available)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't see how you can go down in 6@H?|pg||
nt|athene: if double is penalty-oriented i really don't like it that much|pg||
nt|athene: but of course 4@H is a bit unilateral and might be very wrong|pg||
nt|gsper:  You are right, if the worst comes to the worst there is a squeeze on N.|pg||
nt|athene: can't you just ruff two clubs in the west hand?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: apart from anything, the limited hand isn't normally the one to take control|pg||
nt|athene: not in well-controlled auctions anyway :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Bos will have to activate his sonar and find the diamond jack :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|halila: it can be down with a careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamonds 5-1 means the limit of hand is 1nt|pg||
nt|henryb:  Thanks, Matt|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  How could E not bid slam now?  He's gotta take at least a push now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: interesting that NS put balanced 20-counts into their 1@d opening|pg||
nt|pelu: what to bid in S - 2NT?|pg||
nt|pelu: and is 2Nt naturel or for minor?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see that he can know his partner has good values|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  E-W here could save the day by reaching and making 6@c|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4sp normal contract here|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, but decl may feel that that risks a defensive ruff.|pg||
nt|athene: why shouldn't west have the same shape without, say, the @HK?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk5: Is it necessary to jump to 4@H?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Academic now anyway.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: south may solve that problem for him at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: difficult - i guess if you want to be passive, a trump lead is preferable|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea tough lead problem for lien, trump club, diamond?|pg||
nt|minimeck: trump seems the safest, not going to pick off pard with q@s :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: thank you operator, yes, :) k@h not possible|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: diamond might well find partner's honour for them; i like a trump here, although you don't usually lead a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|athene: @HK into a 2nt opener....hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: but 3|pg||
nt|athene: as a rule, it's right to lead aggressively against 6 of a suit, but this auction might be an exception|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt on here, but probably hard to bid|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h looks doomed, though - No Roland, its not.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I think with all controls and 5 trumps, you shoudl at least have 5 level safety|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mrdct: the @h7 is a big card here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt better than 3@C - West can get 2@d ruffs|pg||
nt|galois85: yes... 2nt I think is natural|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this would slowly end up in 4@S. ..  |pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - where did East get that 3@H from?|pg||
nt|athene: the main reason you would lead a heart is to set up a trick fast before declarer throws heart losers on a side suit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, definetely merit to leading the heart|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: that is unlikely to be the issue here|pg||
nt|gsper:  And NS in 3@H at other table? Sounds like the Menagerie.|pg||
nt|henryb:  only if both tables make the contract :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: @D8: signal for @s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: as is the @h6|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|halila: is tkere any way to confuse the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Diamond switch may be needed now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: To force declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk5: All academic with the 1400 from the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now he can win in dummy and take the club finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  still 3 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and he retains control|pg||
nt|Walddk5: as he no longer can be forced|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|pelu: Pionto just dropped at trick|pg||
nt|athene: but of course it's easy to construct layouts where a heart is the only lead to beat|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|minimeck: 26 imp swing coming|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ugis: however, if 1s = 11-15, w might bid on over 1nt. And then they would reach 3nt |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can ruff the long heart good but he still has to get to hand to cash it|pg||
nt|minimeck: alot of options now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|animeshraj: really|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: @C9 looks the least useful card from the easy hand|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||

nt|minimeck: 20 seconds and there it is|pg||
nt|athene: but it's too late|pg||

nt|gsper:  A low trump lead might beat 7@D;)|pg||

nt|athene: 2@H both majors i imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|halila: no problem  on 3nt|pg||
nt|ugis: 4s a good sacrifice here against 4h|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: 2 club transfer for hearts|pg||
nt|kemperg: swithces must used by the younger Dutch ( and an older one like me:))|pg||

nt|henryb:  The earth is flat, and created in 6 days in 4004 BC|pg||
pc|c4|nt|halila: a flat bord|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting methods but the normal contract non-theless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: exactly four spades|pg||
nt|athene: there is some merit to this sort of thing, the idea being to conceal from the defenders whether declarer has four hearts|pg||
nt|athene: since that isn't of any interest to east|pg||
nt|kemperg: will play @D to the Ace|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: IF i was forced to bid I would X - but a clæear pass for me|pg||
nt|athene: some would achieve a similar result using 2nt as puppet e.g. 2nt 3@C [no 5major] now 3@H showing four spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ugis: normally 1s=5+ so with an 11 card fit EW should be rather comfortable in 4s|pg||

nt|athene: traditionally it would show precisely 4, but especially when the 1@D can be short, you want 1@S as a general t/o without spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: west showed his cards|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2 more to go in this segment, one more match today followed by 5 more matches tommorow in the qualifying phase|pg||
nt|animeshraj: E too had a Quacky 16 ... 3@S bit agg too on 3H s/off|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if S could have played low would have had a real problem.  A good line - added the chance of @HQx|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double dummy a finesse or two and a good @S guess will bring in 6@c|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: and from E I for sure dont like the lead of @h2 - a 100% @S-lead|pg||
nt|ybob: 9 bazas para E-W en @S|pg||
nt|athene: a heavy 1nt there|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzmw: yes, he did it|pg||
nt|animeshraj: turks found the winning @c lead.... next door 13imps to them|pg||
nt|animeshraj: yeah... 17:)|pg||
nt|athene: some pass cunningly with the east cards, hoping to be on lead vs 3nt in a while|pg||
nt|athene: but if south shows hearts you might regret being so cunning|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north probably worth 2@H now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Pass in 3rd at favourable would be a psyche|pg||
nt|athene: also, if you actually have 3nt on, beating 1nt by a lot of 50s isn't much compensation|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: assuming that's a sound raise|pg||
nt|minimeck: yes, they play xfers|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: i doubt south will get over-excited|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3@C puppet or baron or stayman anyone know ?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: EW will go for the vul game here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzmw: how many times i have to say made|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3c should buy the pot|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if puppet south now knows the opps have 10 hearts between them (3NT normally denies a 4CM)|pg||
nt|athene: however, this way they miss 3nt|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mrdct: but no joy with @DAJ10 and @HK offside i think|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C alerted i suppose because he had good/bad 2NT available|pg||
nt|athene: they didn't ditch that even after the board 2 disaster :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3 club invitationa|pg||
nt|minimeck: votes for 2@s in third seat? worked effectively in the open|pg||
nt|minimeck: pushed them to 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 3nt only denies majors|pg||
nt|gsper:  He probably would have missed 3NT if he had passed too.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: 1@S looks ok for me|pg||
nt|animeshraj: u want to balance here! but the V may stop you|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south is not really good enough to cue bid, but maybe ok in their style|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be able to get the @s loser away on a @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not enough|pg||
nt|mrdct: this hand is a good illustration of why 4333s are worth -1hcp|pg||
nt|minimeck: i agree seems the normal bid, |pg||
nt|kemperg: let them escape|pg||
nt|athene: yes, probably|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ugis: 3nt has no chances|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|dJ|nt|athene: unless you have some very convenient agreement|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: diamond ruff coming|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to attack dummy's long suit, though|pg||
nt|athene: if it's not right, it's very wrong|pg||
nt|athene: because you gave away all the tempi in the world|pg||
nt|ybob: k@C A@C y triunfo ?|pg||
nt|ugis: while 4h would have been much more realistic|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Takes a heart shift to beat it|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Declarer is going to need some xray glasses to bring this in - I'll predict -1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: tell me: why lead @D4 from J 10 9??|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s3|nt|animeshraj: he did venture,, brave bid !...... but not recomendeD LOL :) at 5332 and that suit that V.|pg||
nt|athene: like, passing over 1nt and then bidding 3@D later after north transfers, shows a solid diamond suit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The defence can't afford that declarer gets a diamond trick|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@D was 4 down|pg||
nt|gsper:  It seems that N psyched at the other tabe.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and so did East|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I don't believe he passed|pg||
nt|kemperg: no|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Error, they are actually playing it now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Declarerhas 9 tricks now when spades break|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: after SOUTH transfers sorry|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: CR in 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: in open theyìre on 4 spade|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|minimeck: now south's turn to provide the assist to partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok, they are running out of time|pg||
nt|minimeck: last chance :/|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is going to throw a diamond on the @HA if you don't get a move on|pg||
nt|athene: south knows his partner has some big card in a minor|pg||
nt|athene: but is it @CK or @DA?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|MolvaM: Board 20 will be the last for this set. there will be a lunch break now. next match starts 14:30 CET|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h5|nt|exerdar: hmm  a lead problem, e-w playing  to 3@s dbl =anti lead but still doesn't |pg||
nt|ugis: in 4h, after club lead, declarer must be very carefull and lead a spade in the second trick|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: if the former, he would be more likely to lead a diamond when in earlier|pg||
nt|minimeck: seems south has to conclude it is his only option, wd|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|galois85: no idea... I'm surprised|pg||
nt|gsper:  Do you mean you don't play that?;)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: it's right there on page 743 of my competitive notes :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kdr_fm: likely to clear hearts and trumps and then play @dA and another|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ugis: if he leads a trump, e will take and continue clubs, take the second trump, lead spade to W and get a club ruff for -1|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

mb|p|nt|minimeck: credit netherlands for a well played match, besides the first board, some good play all around|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Yes.  A total of 5 matches today and then tomorrow starts the KO phase|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: you're wellcome|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and thanks to Germ, Henry and Rens for commentary|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: 1@D - 1@S - 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east perhaps debating between 2 and 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C might have ended the auction|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C normally promises more high cards|pg||
nt|gsper:  Congratulation to W on this problem.|pg||
nt|athene: unless you play gazzilli here|pg||
nt|athene: then it shows specifically that sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: a lot of playing strength but not so many hcp|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk5: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894  for running scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 16.30|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Next round in about 31 minutes 38.9812 secs|pg||
nt|kemperg: tks Goran, Roland, Henry specs and our operator|pg||
nt|athene: i guess not playing gazzilli i would go with 3@C too, just hope to survive|pg||
mb|p|nt|moonbeam42:  The next set will start about 90 min from now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: here I would just bid 3Nt in W why make the bidding more complex?|pg||
nt|galois85: I again agree with peter... 10 with ad in @s 2Nt is a better choice|pg||
nt|athene: double of 1@D = 4+ hearts i assume|pg||
nt|athene: and double of 2@D is support (3 hearts)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: @C bloqueado, sin chance de ganar|pg||
nt|gsper:  And I would bid 2@C, just hoping to survive.-|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzmw: 50 minutes|pg||
nt|animeshraj: down 1 gd bridge:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85: to play 3@d it seems...|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Or, perhaps just 60 minutes ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: sorry, I forgot Göran, thanks to you too|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looking at the scores I am going to guess that it will take about 164 or so to reach the quarters|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: according to rodwell, 1nt on those hands is by faaar a % winner, but don't ask me to explain the science :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|minimeck: you'd have to look in his secret files to which i don't have access|pg||
nt|athene: the trend at the top level is to open 1nt more and more on the "middling strength" 5422 and even 5431 hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: in the end, a flat board to finish us out|pg||
nt|athene: because it simplifies things|pg||
nt|minimeck: specifically also with stiff k|pg||
nt|athene: lots of ways you run into trouble opening, for example, 4-5-2-2 15 count with 1@H|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Thanks operator|pg||
nt|animeshraj: gd sac agst a making 3@C.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i bet 2@C would get the most votes in a bridge world poll|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: 1Nt here - In my book = 8-10, so easy 3Nt from W|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|animeshraj: low H now..|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|athene: partner bids 1nt and you wish you opened 1nt|pg||

nt|ferlema: bastante audaz decir 3NT con el @HA seco |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|ybob: había que descartar @C en N|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's worst nightmare on a big two-suiter like this is always losing trump control|pg||
pc|s2|nt|guillemin: excelente resultado para el equipo sudamericano|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: well, best chance to make a stiff king is to open 1nt :)|pg||
nt|ferlema: si|pg||
nt|ybob: para luego el otro @C sobre K @H|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|halila: an unlucky board |pg||
nt|mrdct: if he gets @h right chance to get opps to open up the @s suit|pg||
