nt|psridhar: that X may even tip off the location of @h ace too|pg||
nt|psridhar: on the auction i do not see why Arvind can expect 4@s to go down, but evidently he has thought deeper|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psridhar: and given that IMP X are not made for just down 1, he may have even expected more down|pg||
nt|psridhar: iff decl hooks this and misguesses the @H return Vaidya may triumph|pg||

pc|d5|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  or so may be the case - playing W not to have last spade |pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer is taking a line that will allow making.  Ordinarily 5-3 fit in trump contract is preferred, but with enough for game+, NT often better|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html is the exact webpage for running scores |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: they just informed me they change the system with vulnerabiity and this is precision modified|pg||
nt|peachy: East hand is much too good for any sort of premptive action, 1S is normal|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ianmcc: Precision might help E/W keep low|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand for competition...NS make at most 8 tricks in any contract...but have 23 HCP...they will feel like trying for a game..let us see|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|panja: is this Match Points or IMPS?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|strike12: To all Kibs, since being a Pairs Tournament, there are no comparisions shown as results will be posted at finish of all tables. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: good decision|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats my formula for balancing when they havent found a fit = " dont"|pg||
nt|panja: good pass by Rajesh..|pg||
nt|panja: are they playing prec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 3N is making double dummy|pg||
nt|panja: easier in Precision...|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C might be transfer, in competition|pg||
nt|peachy: transfer to 2D, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was alerted by Satya |pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: 4@c might be FIT showing with @d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h close but diamonds nasty|pg||
nt|psridhar: are we going to witness a lightner X of 6@H here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Venky is fearless balancer otherwise|pg||
nt|peachy: Since they play transfer over 1C opening, I boldly assumed they also play transfer in compe tition, a method that is steadily gaining popularity|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: IMPS Total|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 6 boards per rd, Total IMPs scoring (Pairs)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D will go one down for sure...two likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: trying to correct the score of last deal|pg||
nt|panja: W is taking a huge gamble with that double, holding five of his HCP in @H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ianmcc: 3NT might have made here|pg||
nt|twcho: east will be thrown in in @s and give a @d to south at the end|pg||
nt|panja: of course..this is not a good contract..2@H is better...but most likely in @H they would have gone too far...|pg||
nt|panja: ah..the lead solves one big problem for the Declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: He is following the pronciple that the person short in their fit suit must be aggressive, but I'm sure he too wishes his 5HCP in hearts were in another suit :)|pg||
nt|peachy: *principle|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panja: GIB might show this as one down...but will likely be -2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzjh: all bids were alerted |pg||

nt|ianmcc: that would help make it|pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphzjh: inquiry from declerer about the lead |pg||
nt|strike12: 10 tricks now |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing support doubles, the decision is pretty easy = Dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: Ajay thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the rare exception when it could only be 2-card suit, normally longer minor or 2C with 3-3 minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a bid by S!|pg||
nt|peachy: South's bid is much too frisky, given their methods, but he is probably attempting to get something back from the unfortunate -930.  I dont like that strategy though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder what was the reason|pg||
nt|peachy: But that is an "if" because I dont know if they have Support Dbl on card|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and with @c shortness the choice could be dbl|pg||
nt|panja: similarly, @H values in N hand are wasted...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nkgupt: dont think 4@s can be beaten|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: North over the top|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: director called |pg||
nt|psridhar: NS will win a couple of IMPs in the wash here|pg||
nt|panja: S knows North's shape now...but he does not know where the honours are..|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|strike12: but N might get fished by the lead and try something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 R Venkatesh A Srinivasan|pg||
nt|peachy: At least whenever I tried that , I just get more minus.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 round of @h let declarer with no chance|pg||
nt|nkgupt: to much values to miss the slam!!:)|pg||
nt|peachy: South has good controls everywhere so he is going for it|pg||
nt|panja: N could have @CK instead of @HQJ..and the bidding would have been the same|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ianmcc: this needs care|pg||
nt|twcho: how about trump lead and @d shift?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: about the explanation of the meaning of 2S now all ok|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 'slam' effect from last deal perhaps|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good auction for partnership|pg||
nt|peachy: This would have been a working sacrifice, had either N or S been void in clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: 4 Jaggy Rajesh |pg||
nt|peachy: Surely was not bid to make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh!|pg||
nt|peachy: This is not a great slam, however|pg||
nt|panja: A guessed slam.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sreedhar making inquiries|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzjh: Subhsh in deep thought|pg||
nt|panja: N could also play on @H finessed...then ruff two Hearts....that will work too|pg||
nt|nkgupt: a priori about 42/45/5 i wud say|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 42/45%|pg||
nt|peachy: There is also the spade loser to worry about, he does not know QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|nkgupt: in fact less|pg||
nt|panja: 41 @S break would be too difficult to handle...so I guess he will work on the assumption of 32 @S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|strike12: doesnt matter now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: incautious duck|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: assuming Padhey will guess @c|pg||
