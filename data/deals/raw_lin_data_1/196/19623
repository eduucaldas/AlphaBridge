nt|doks: Hi all, wellcome back to Jurmala, Teams tournament finals Latvia-Finland|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4D|mb|5C|mb|5S|nt|doks: NS from Latvia playing strong club|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: balance or no balance ---no need|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 3@S if they guess everything|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: The defense has trick in each suit and possibly another in spades|pg||
nt|runnerup: no chance here atleast after this lead|pg||
nt|psyck: will make 2 in practice|pg||
nt|doks: team Latvia win semifinall vs Lithuania/Nederlands team with 12 IMP margin, Team Finland wins very convincingly|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psyck: it was a very aggresive try esp for an NV game|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|runnerup: ofcause after @d lead there could have been some littel hope|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|bagman: Veksa starting to set up the side suit; a sound priciple with a two suiter and so-so trump suit|pg||
mc|11|nt|runnerup: but very stange to ruff partners winner|pg||
pg||

nt|psyck: the preemption seems to have worked other table with some overbidding|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4D!|nt|zebutin: for me 4@H seem little stretched|pg||
nt|psyck: it indeed was|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@S is 8-11|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you in croatia Matt?|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is a junior tournament, so expect alot of fireworks here, both pairs are pretty agressive :|pg||
mb|5D|nt|zebutin: and 4+ cards unbalanced (or 5+ balanced)|pg||
nt|minimeck: today is actually my birthday, 26 now too old :x|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
mb|6S|nt|zebutin: so Koistinen has maximum for their bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: it's ok, time for our young stars for their chance in the spotlight|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: will play 3@h undoubled here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought you might be close to the "edge" |pg||
pc|h8|nt|zebutin: this most likely goes 3 or so down, so small pickup for Finland|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is pretty much a cake walk for declarer,  not much to say |pg||
nt|minimeck: While this appears to be a flat four hearts, NS in the open room got a bit carried away, are now rotting in 4@s x , which appears to be 5 or 800|pg||
pc|h3|nt|zebutin: balanced 7points (essentially 6 with Jxx in @D) isn't usually something you want to bid 4with against partners t/o double, even though partner does have short @D...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|minimeck: given we have a nice close nit group here (few kibs so far) feel free to message with questions or comments :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wiki: loosing 2 @S @H and @C  or two|pg||
pc|s3|nt|zebutin: at the other table N bid only 2@D at first, and when partner raised to 3@D found more from pre-emptive hand and bid 4@D...|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have opened 3@d too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks quite hard decision to defende 1 @d .instead of play some @s or nt -contract|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s no hope here|pg||

mb|1S|nt|doks: very solid 1@H opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: 8 tricks in @h only so overbid coming?|pg||

nt|zebutin: so AUNI takes the early lead with small pickup|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Traian :) |pg||
nt|bebechira: Pete and Shane are a relative new partnership|pg||
nt|minimeck: welcome Traian|pg||
mb|1C|nt|runnerup: @c lead needed here ( from KJ( to beat 4 @s maybe |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1@C is 15-17nt or 12-16 unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3H|nt|psyck: both tables chose 1N to 2@c overcall|pg||
mb|4C|nt|penseur9: Hi Markkhu|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt on a @s lead here appears doomed|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Edgettons in the open room are superstars in our part of the world...|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: usually not 6th club in 1nt, but tells strength quite closely, and shape not too much off...|pg||
nt|minimeck: appears they failed to find the club shift on board 21 so first blood to the americans|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|an|don't lead !h|nt|wiki: EW is bidding very differently in open and closed as close open all 8 or more|pg||
nt|zebutin: not even singelton or two|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both ok |pg||
mb|r|an|1st|nt|zebutin: Koistinen knows that 16 is max for Nyberg... but must have something good for jump to 3@H in zone|pg||
nt|bebechira: Nabil will play in Veldhoven in the open team... the youngest ever :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: an interesting trend in junior qualifiers recently, going to 10 board round robin / swiss matches, very few boards with a world championship on the line, :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|runnerup: hi Andre'|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: so well bid on both rooms, might be imp difference for either way, if declarer just takes 6@C+@H+@D+@S|pg||
mb|5C|an|0/3|nt|zebutin: or if defender tosses 1 diamond away, declarer fineses and takes 6@C, @S, @H , 3@D|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this 12 board semifinal will play one of the Finnish teams in the 12 board Finals to follow after this.|pg||
nt|zebutin: or declarer can double finese in @D, but I honestly don't see that happening...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he lead kindly but still should fail|pg||
nt|bebechira: not a lot of room to "recover"  if you make a mistake :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: pls change names - these are last tim's|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|c4|nt|zebutin: after opponents have bid @D as their suit, Nyberg might have void in that, so @D A isnt pulling all the weight it could be...so disciplined pass|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @S return still 3 tricks coming for defence, which would be 7 imps for finland|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will have 10 rounds of Swiss... and then QF,SF and F|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|minimeck: QF and SF 3 16 board segments, with a final of 4 14 board segments and (3rd place playoff of 3 segemnts) at least they went to all day matches for the semis and quarterfinals|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: but perhaps he heart me say 8 insteadt of 7|pg||
mb|1H|nt|doks: 1@C 2+ as I remember correctly|pg||
nt|bagman: EW open 1@C even with 3-3-5-2 if outside their NT range|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|doks: no flat 4333 boards here, only swing boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: 1@H transfer showing 4+ spades|pg||
nt|runnerup: now easyer for ew to come to @s than after some jump in @d ,but north was too strong|pg||
nt|bagman: S wants to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: and overbid by ns again 3. in a row|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|bagman: Is S allowed to pass now?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup: like they bid -some breaks needed|pg||

nt|bagman: he took some time to work that out|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: happy to get an entry, but either side suits needs to be played twice towards to set up extra trick|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|minimeck: spectator raises the issue of the economy as a possible reason, very true, I personally know of a few teams who had to go to the extreme in terms of raising funds to go*|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ianmcc: slam for N/S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|zebutin: this table playing much faster than other table, they have almost taken the 2 deal lead up, so soon no comparisons from this table...|pg||

nt|vugraphzmy: west said: wow!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bebechira: well said Matt... 27 teams... a very disapointing number for a world event......|pg||
nt|minimeck: should arrive at 4s here, after the 2@c multi purpose GF|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be interesting with the 4-0|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt looks down in practice @h lead,,-while 5 or even 6 @d -open cards are on|pg||
nt|bebechira: but we entered 2 teams... so this shows that we are doing very well.....lol...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|zebutin: declarer could maybe get 9 tricks for all important imp, but most likely going to be even board|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi ian :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi traian|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: at first seems like declarer is losing @H, @C and 2 @D, but we will see how this developes|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|minimeck: yes, two strong teams at that :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: our goal is 1st and 2nd place|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  shouldn't be that difficult: five side winners and cross ruff away|pg||
nt|minimeck: do they also have the rule here regarding semifinals and two teams from the same country (as with the bermuda bowl and USA1/2)?|pg||
nt|bebechira: good point , lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|psyck: ofc, a useful system as pd knows unbalanced hand on opening|pg||

nt|wiki: ok  still the marks wrong|pg||

nt|zebutin: with)|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|penseur9: a strong @H contract here for EW|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cards lie well for 3NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: not sure if EW have changed their NT ranges, would have expected a 2nt opener from brescoll here, 1@c will work much better :p|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: E/W got this one cheap, might even make, or @D H lead making comfortably...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt seems like normal spot to be in, might have some difficulties with entries for @C, but when @D 10 drops has always sure entry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might need a good guess  in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you fond of 2 nt with W?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wiki: 6 @C is on and  needs 1/1 clubs  which is odds or @h finesse  also you can try to get cover on @DQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: Juzz has a very good feel at the table.... i think he will make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not - perhaps a discard on @d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bebechira: 2 aces and a trump|pg||
nt|bebechira: in theory lol|pg||
pc|hT|nt|runnerup: previos hand number 2 both rooms made 4 @s -which should have been beaten -no guess in @h helps if south takes his ace and playes a small @c to his partner to play @s |pg||
nt|penseur9: the lead will decide how many extra tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ianmcc: this helps. Now the discard a real possibility|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|play4fun55:  still some work to be done|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 boards matches... not a lot of boards to recover the bad ones :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|zebutin: or without @S lead has always sure entry in @S suit|pg||

nt|wiki: luckily we have very qualified operator|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|wiki: well done ladies|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wiki: you have problems only if  clubs are 2 0 with W  East can easily be endplayed|pg||

nt|zebutin: 1@D 17+|pg||
nt|bebechira: this looks flat as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: would you open 1@H or 1@S with S hand?|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@s|pg||
nt|ianmcc: ggod slam to be out of. I have hopes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wiki: two boards here so it will be  time for winning moves I suppose  Paganus is going to have 10 in the last board|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam EW anyone?|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  3 nt has a fighting chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: a slam here 3 options -6 @d best|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that should deter them|pg||
nt|petka: a splinter diamonds is nice, but S would rather see a splinter spades :) Still, all those aces and the bonus J and JT are tempting|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very thin game E/W maybe 3NT better|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|penseur9: right Markku|pg||
nt|zebutin: with 1@S you get to tell 5-5 quite easily|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, a quiet 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard bids anything,  I hit the deck with S |pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: 3@s is ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|zebutin: i must say i would blast 4@H with @S hand now...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, not much option with such shape & non reversible values anyway|pg||
nt|zebutin: i think nyberg told 8+ with @C suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: with 2@D that is|pg||
nt|petka: scandinavian style that shows extras with diamond splinter. Hard to stop below 5 if this is such a bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Would you raise 2@h to 3 vul, Matt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: looks like 5 imps more so 2 imps still and a nice board coming next|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns in bidding and ew quite lazy|pg||
nt|petka: I guess not|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2???????|pg||
nt|sybarra: whoaaaaaaaaaaa |pg||
nt|sybarra: optimism??? |pg||
nt|minimeck: opp my p's 14 16 no, but perhaps|pg||
nt|bebechira: i was thinking flat as 620 flat|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianmcc: 5 Ok anyway|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  I think they have one loser in every suit in 4h|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  in d even 2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2 in @d?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: now Pete has to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  Shirley, you can't (should not) pass partner in a possible 4-2 fit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|zebutin: either 5@S or 5@C make, anything over 5@S is little tougher...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wiki: we have lost some specs to spingold  /  why |pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@H = 4@S for me...not 4@H...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|zebutin: just say i had couple @H mixed with my @S suit if partner asks...|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h also ok, helps pd make a choice if opps bid further|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was passing any 2 level bid,  maybe I am the old fogey here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|play4fun55:  2 losers in the d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 0 in @s|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  true|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so this is a good contract but finesses don't work|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petka: a popular style is 3C=minimum, 3D=extras with no splinter, 3H=club splinter, 3S=diamond splinter etc|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|zebutin: yes, you are better positioned after 4@H if opponents bid on|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand opponents know more about your hand, which might affect defence...so everything has upside and downside...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|zebutin: most likely defence will take their 2 @H tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|wiki: 4 @S is not bad contract but...|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|henryb:  You look for a 4-3 major by bidding 2@h over 2@d|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|wiki: played by east I think it could be on|pg||
nt|zebutin: and after that declarer just tests spades and clubs and claims|pg||
nt|zebutin: Latvians did well to reach 6@H at deal number 7 on other table too, so no swing for Finland|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|penseur9: this should prove costly for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok sure  and hope he plays 2 @S |pg||
nt|minimeck: we will see how emmons views the south hand, he has been extremely agressive thus far|pg||
pc|h3|nt|play4fun55:  since they use transfers over 1 club, would not a jump to 3 nt by East be a reasonable way of giving W a choice between 3 nt and 4 h ?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|doks: goog decision play 3NT instead of 5-3@H fit|pg||
nt|bagman: In hearts there are 4 losers; only the NT game makes|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@c 2+, 1@d xfr, x supp?|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 2@H good rise|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|runnerup: maybe even after this 9 imps|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT can be beaten with a club lead (or even spade to the A and a club switch)|pg||
nt|doks: 10 or 11 to Latvia, we have new leaders 2 boards to go|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup: this is actually -3 so Finland still leading|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|c3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|doks: maybe only 2 down, 2@S, 2@D, @H and @C|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -2 like counted first -so even|pg||
nt|bagman: They have to defend well  to get those 2 diamonds without setting up the @DK for a club pitch|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h5|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bagman: W can get easily endplayed if E plays a low diamond|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup: ok -10 -Latvia wins :(|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bagman: Now declarer can set up the clubs without letting E in|pg||
nt|psyck: or even otherwise if dec tries for endplay|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|doks: very good:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a club and duck if E plays low and @CQ + another if E goes up the @CT|pg||

nt|runnerup: @d was never even mensioned|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: EW are playing precision NS are playing natural|pg||
nt|psyck: Auni missed game on board 12, which will narrow gap|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes...thats the question on the lips of the nation|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last hand of this set |pg||
nt|minimeck: will see if harrison is tilted enough to open 2h here :x|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: they weren't very "precised" in previous hand :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h no good here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: next match starts in 50 minutes. if our commentators are available, pls let me know. thx|pg||
nt|bebechira: ruffing with the ace of hearts was spectacular but inefficient|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|wiki: Paganus already won the Cup of Finland this week so they are hot seniors|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like 4 @h but ..|pg||
nt|penseur9: easy to get in trouble here|pg||
nt|petka: I am informed that in norway the 2NT response system i outlined is not very popular, so 3S is still an unknown|pg||
mb|2D|nt|runnerup: north considering pass/3nt / 4 @h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|penseur9: standings just updated at http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/rig11/invitational/rig11invr.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: so score difference will be in single digit...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now that's interesting|pg||
mb|3D|nt|zebutin: 2@H seem to be maximum for E/W|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Henry, Matt and Traian,   |pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our operator !  great job |pg||
nt|minimeck: pleasure as always, both USA teams very well positioned out of the gates, the competition will continue to be very stiff at the top of the swiss|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: ty :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Fabio will also look to see Italy 1 remain very strong as well :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Great job Fabio,  we know we will see you through out the week |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 5@d probably 2 down with no entry to south to take a @d finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wiki: I think Linde can take his 9 so congrats to Paganus again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: open room did well to stop in 3@h|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: west may get a @d trick promoted|pg||
pc|sA|nt|zebutin: this doesn't seem to be enough gain still...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, unfortunately not|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry 3@H... though 3nt is interesting|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz: Looks like there are 10 winners in @hs, 3 5 1 1. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Actually 11 with the long @h in e.|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal, finals starting in maybe 15 minutes|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mrdct: rock and hard place for declarer here|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting choice here|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also specs,  always fun to hear from you |pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  Apparently Japan received a 1 VP penalty at the start of this match - perhaps late arrival at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: well|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting, that would be very suprising to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: 1st round well commented at my table|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|zebutin: didn't see that one coming, but seems that has 4@H+4@D + couple @S tricks....opponents can take 2@C + 2 aces when ever...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just 8|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  should just scramble home|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|mrdct: if he doesn't draw trumps east gets a @c ruff|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|blum1956: Yes, LAtvia is in 2@s on board 10 which surely makes (@sA lead). Congratulations Latvia!|pg||
nt|psyck: no scope to recover here, so it will be Latvia-Finland final|pg||
nt|blum1956: So Kauko Koistinen - Clas Nyberg (winners of the invitational pairs) and Ugis Jansons (runner-up) secured more medals (this time in teams)|pg||
nt|mrdct: south may have done better to play @c5 to mask east's count|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good|pg||
nt|mrdct: but justin howard has read it|pg||
nt|minimeck: this will make with the club positioning|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wiki: it takes a momen finding clubs 3  0 but  he can do it|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|zebutin: so looks to be making, which would be good score for Latvians|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wiki: he is very careful  seldon spreading his hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mrdct: possible 14 imps for Australia now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wiki: hoping that def throws some @Ds to get one @S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb:  I am not fond of Brescoll's auction. 3N over 3@d would seem to be indicated|pg||
pc|h6|nt|zebutin: wd for E/W|pg||
nt|zebutin: not so easy to stop in 3nt when you have 8 card major fit and 3-1 in other major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: club lead beats 3 nt|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, not so easy to find one from AQxx though|pg||
