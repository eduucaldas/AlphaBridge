mb|1D!|nt|gulyas: NED RUM took a sizeable lead after being 16 down in the first set|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzmw: rdl points|pg||
nt|minimeck: a normal modern 1nt here, xx by wackwitz values here|pg||
nt|gulyas: this the 2nd of 3 sets|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|gulyas: again, 1@D is walsh, meaning he has no major unless 10+|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: dbl to|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: take out|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: good morning also to Giulio @h, has done a great job so far!, we are in very good hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: ty|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|minimeck: Rodrigo will need to lead diamonds to set 3nt here, should be no problem holding the ace of clubs |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: he will know with 100% certainty that NS have a long club suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would have liked that 1@H being played out...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|minimeck: knowing they do not have a heart fit and his partner has the long spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: normal 1nt by north here, double is purely takeout :) if he had the guts, could have got 300 in 1h |pg||
nt|gulyas: he would have deserved that for overcalling with that junk|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|minimeck: but a flat board will be the outcome :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would never ever overcall with that, only gets you into trouble, either directly or indirectly (by revealing where the points/distribution is)|pg||
nt|gulyas: a pile of jacks, wk suit (come on, opps take 3! tricks in that suit against you in NT)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: in junior bridge is mandatory|pg||
nt|gulyas: I know that juniors like to bid:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: good slam bid and made by ARG in the OR|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|minimeck: spectator proposes east could have doubled 3nt, almost being sure that he will have five tricks, seems he was content with a plus score here |pg||
nt|minimeck: NS can also make 4@c |pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see how the Dutch handle it here|pg||
mb|r|mb|3D|nt|gulyas: strange x with 5c@H suit, but at least he can offer all other suits as well, not as bad as it looks|pg||
nt|gulyas: if S bids 3@S now, they will end up in 4@S|pg||
mb|4C|mb|5D|nt|minimeck: first blood to the south americans here, some neat tools here for Ned, does anyone know what 1nt is here?|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzmw: 1 nt = 5+ clubs and 4th ajor|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: major|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: thank you, Raptor 1nt , :) interesting choice with 7-4|pg||
nt|Walddk5:  for those who want to watch more than one room:  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile|pg||
nt|minimeck: I cannot imagine Wackwitz will sit for this, but he will have a tough time catching up here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Daniel Gulyas|pg||
nt|gulyas: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|minimeck: good morning Daniel :)|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: this certainly sounds like a pen dbl, but S has no trumps to lead, and has a 7carder in @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|minimeck: in any case, if rodrigo's auto-6@s on the previous set was a predictor, a good save available |pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: this will be beaten 1 or 2 tricks, but NS has game|pg||
nt|minimeck: Clearly he was not happy with this quandary, but he had no clear way forward|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3NT and 5@C both makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: hm, N did not think his black holdings are enough for slam|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|minimeck: decides to take the plus, a very good start for ARG URU as NS have arrived in 3nt|pg||
nt|minimeck: might be able to get out for 100 here|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||

pc|sK|pc|dQ|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|gulyas: maybe, will have a hard time dealing with the 4 trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has to get @Ds right (which should not be too difficult|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gulyas: wrong ace led, so 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d8|pc|h6|pg||

nt|bebechira: first i would open 1c in precision and after that i think i will reach 6c|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bebechira: the 9 HCP in north would make a positive response of some sort.. and then probably alfa in spades ...and after clubs|pg||

pc|dA|nt|bebechira: thats a good point...|pg||
nt|pelu: if 2@D = a  strong balanced hand I would like that 2@H/2@S was a weak hand with 5+ card|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... in brd 2 the dutch boys missed the slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: they are in 5s|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not surpriced - Ss 5@C bid here was just a miracle for NS|pg||
nt|bebechira: so the south americans will score good imps|pg||

nt|gulyas: cutting the deficit to 20|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|gulyas: a partscore battle here, NS can make abt 2-3@Cs, EW is good until abt 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|minimeck: double or 1@h both options here on the east hand, with the quality of the heart suit and poor spades, chooses 1@h here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|gulyas: but the 1@H overcall (which is normal) leaves no way to find @Ss on a safe level|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless it goes 1NT-p-2@C now|pg||
nt|gulyas: then he can dbl for t/o|pg||

nt|gulyas: showing his pattern to give pd the chance to look out for the red suits|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|minimeck: getting too fancy here,|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|minimeck: the important thing to note here, when you decide not to open 1nt it is impossible to show "15-17" balanced :)|pg||

nt|play4fun55:  a ruffing finessin clubs  against west should see south home though|pg||
nt|gulyas: taking the ruffing finesse in @Cs works, as the 9 is dropping|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|minimeck: a white game for the NED rum and a likely 7 imps|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h8|pc|d8|nt|gulyas: losing a @D and a @S, making 5, and losing 6imps in the process|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  no other sensible line for South to follow either|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  would have been better to winn the last h in hand and take the ruffing finess directly, now South might be in trouble|pg||
pc|cK|nt|minimeck: correct, 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: so NED RUM on the board now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzmw: south calls td|pg||
nt|gulyas: I imagine some rapid Spanish under the screen now:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: can't imagine what for, a good board for him|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: complain for spade lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am sure if he knew they were 4-3 in @Ss, he would have led sg else|pg||
nt|minimeck: so perhaps the overtrick at issue|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, and it also counts as an IMP, 270=7|pg||
nt|minimeck: Rodrigo and maxi are pretty calm, they aren't like the famous italians :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|gulyas: there had to be a misunderstanding, otherwise they would have played 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: ok, maxi took 3@s as something artificial, so wackwitz entitled to the trick as a result of the false alert|pg||

nt|gulyas: you can play 2nt as 4+ supp, while cue is only 3|pg||
nt|minimeck: (according to the scientists who created that)|pg||
nt|minimeck: some action potential here|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW can make 5@C here|pg||

nt|gulyas: np|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gulyas: EW has a 5-3@H fit that is 5-0 against, while NS has a 6-2@C with 5-0 against...|pg||
mb|d|nt|minimeck: it appears NS play transfers her, however|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: 2 d= transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|gulyas: that takes the needle out of the EW butts:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: a rdbl here would show a high honor in @S in my system, I wonder if others play this gadget too|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gulyas: S not happy to hear that xfer|pg||
nt|minimeck: in most cases, these transfers are not "manditory" as with an NT opener, south is free to bid his hand w/o tolerance|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 3NT has a problem: off 5 top tricks|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: south would have not enjoyed 3@c at all, 3@d by maxi here an "all in" bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: is N gonna apply the axe? no|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gulyas: now that declarer knows @Hs are not favourable, he will play on @Ds|pg||

nt|gulyas: he can take 4@Ds, 2@Hs and 2@Cs for 8|pg||
nt|gulyas: S must lead the @SK, else they will not be able to untangle the suit later|pg||
nt|gulyas: he did, so they may cash out now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe he can sneak the @S9 thru first:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: really, 5 to the 9 is not a very strong stop in NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: it maybe OK in 1NT, but not in 3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|minimeck: agreed, that is likely his best shot|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|h8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gulyas: there was really no need to jump to 3nt, he could have started with 2@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: interestingly, this is at least the 3rd (if not 4th) hand in this semis where you should play 5 of a minor instead of 3nt despite stoppers in all suits|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you call Q vs 987xx a stopper, that is...|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: well east claimed and now td is at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: one or two off|pg||
nt|gulyas: he claimed 1 off? that should be ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: cliamed made, that's the problem|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can drive out the @CA and thats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: most probably he forgot club ace|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, thats a problem:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: its an obv -1, so it should not be too hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: north says he could loose a diamond if esat has forget the ace club|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, come on|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: I agree|pg||
nt|gulyas: excuse my French, but its like stirring the sh*t:) (like fighting for partscore battles in imp scoring:) )|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: your french is perfect|pg||

nt|vugraphzmw: anyway I know u, u were palying italians tournaments with Mike, isn't it?|pg||
nt|gulyas: Mike?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmw: michelangelo and ruggero|pg||
nt|gulyas: nope|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|minimeck: just two trump losers here in 5@d|pg||

nt|minimeck: he might simply hook east for the jack|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|minimeck: as we have seen thus far, the southamericans have favored a more conservative approach|pg||

nt|minimeck: a lunch break for the players after this round|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: next set in 1 hour 30 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|2H|nt|minimeck: special thanks to our awesome operator Giulio and Daniel as well ! :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: next session coming up at 1:30Pm, so 90 mins from now, right|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzmw: ty|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gulyas: ty all, also specs for your invaluable input|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@S would have made, so this a good save anyway|pg||
nt|gulyas: especially not x-ed:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: bd 31 a push|pg||
nt|minimeck: this will drift one or two off, a good result, hard to double it with either hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he tries for the @CJ finesse, he may end up 1 down, otherwise its 2@Hs, and 2 black aces for the defense|pg||
nt|minimeck: scanavino quickly passes the hand out in 4@s, in this set, Netherlands have shown that agressive bidding wins more imps than it loses|pg||
