nt|gulyas: or at least pass the 4@S|pg||

nt|bessi2: unfortunately we didn't get to see Larsen's decision over 2@h dbl|pg||
nt|gulyas: its only 500|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c2|nt|passell: his only legitimate make is both dia honors onside|pg||
nt|passell: or catching 3 spades in the weak 2 bidders hand|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfj: thx|pg||
nt|gulyas: weird lead|pg||
nt|passell: yes  very aggressive against this bidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like it.. his prospects with jx in @s aren't very exciting|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I would probably have lead a @c myself... a @h is out of the question in my view|pg||
nt|passell: I also like a club|pg||
nt|passell: diamond in a way makes the defense fool proof|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the throat|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 76 e/w in the other room bid and made 3nt for a 7 imp pickup|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: i fancy defence here|pg||

nt|puncher99: south is wondering who has spade k|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with max 14 points on opener.....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gulyas: yes, cannot go wrong now|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 8 tricks here...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|puncher99: or how to untangle suit if pard has it|pg||
nt|bagman: S should play the Q in most cases (except when the lead is singleton)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|frankaus: very fine bid by Hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: about to have some with my dinner|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||
nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||
nt|karesz:  wow!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: bd 16 they did pass 2@Hx, collecting the mentioned 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the @S may easily block but declarer runs out of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He just needs to see what developes after that|pg||
nt|puncher99: now is the key play|pg||
nt|bagman: N can duck also, I think, if S plays low|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a little help from my friends.....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|viren169: and probably a flat bd|pg||
pc|d4|nt|passell: the contract on the 1st hand was indeed 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 12 to Diamond, taking the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes playing on diamonds brings home the bacon|pg||
pc|dK|nt|puncher99: its easier to cover the j then to play the king with low one led|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bagman: N cashes the spade and switches according to S's suit preference|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|bagman: If heart, declarer wins that, plays the @DA and and later pushes the @CQ thru south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a series of avoidance type plays|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much for Diamond to play, but the cards are very friendly and he' s very likely to make the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very quiet bd in the other room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen:  "Everything is working - running out of finesses"|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: When S starts thinking, Diamonds hopes get up|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he only needs the @DK to drop :) (so that he can get back to dummy to cash his namesakes)|pg||
nt|puncher99: hand much harder to  play if diam K was played at trk3|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: I have seen ppl open 4@H on such a hand in this vul:)|pg||
nt|passell: yes  young and bold ones|pg||
nt|passell: or old and desperate ones|pg||
nt|bessi2: west's hand is pretty vulnerable.. I would simply raise to 4@h giving up on slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Tough position for NS in the auction, and they'll be worried about the double-game swing out|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead changes hands again|pg||
mb|3S|nt|passell: yes if you think what partner needs for slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: disaster struck again on bd17|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: friday night dinner with ketchup?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW got into the auction, but played their worst suit, going for 500 in 4@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11H IS CONTRO;S?OR A TRANSFER?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: EW likely to end in 3NT|pg||

nt|viren169: anothe dble by greco?|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|bessi2: a trump lead seems safe from west's point of view|pg||
nt|passell: yes when they had a make in 4clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||
pc|s6|nt|viren169: 2n=leb or scramble I guess|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chessmaste: Least dangerous perhaps - and I would rather underlead one of my aces than try a diamond|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d 7 is also a very normal lead imo|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: looks like leb|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: normal contract|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now 10|pg||
nt|karesz:  weak two 2 @S it is funny for me |pg||
pc|cK|nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|benjent: killing the @h trick, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|benjent: In practice, Wolpert can now pick up the trumps, although he may not|pg||
nt|benjent: The cross-ruff is going to be a lot more appealing|pg||
nt|viren169: with 2@S likely to make another flatish bd|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: more than just merit even|pg||
pc|c8|nt|passell: the modern way of thing bidding diamonds over clubs at any level is conversion  not extra values|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||

nt|roswolf: are we live now?|pg||
nt|puncher99: mite b goin to 4hrts|pg||
nt|puncher99: if they find 44|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing a good raise|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Susan|pg||
nt|karesz:  Precision 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: slam is makeable, agree, but its hard|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 4h but not 4s|pg||
nt|caitlin: Board 105...can't make 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: bd 105 or 106?|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 105|pg||
nt|caitlin: 106|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might but imo should not|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart game more tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I prefer rdbl with north hand.. never learned to raise pd with only 2card support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Agreed|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on Hampson - once Wolpert moves over 3NT, the payoff structure changes a lot for Hampson. Now it's attractive to get his 2nd suit on the table ... and he did|pg||
nt|viren169: re|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: this is there way of showing the biggest 5 heart bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: W obv inviting slam with this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: W shows his slam interest by passing & pulling the x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: x was alerted, can't read it|pg||
nt|ybob: re :)|pg||
nt|viren169: a t/out dble would have been more interesting!|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 106 is correct|pg||
nt|jtmckee: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i don't have it anymore|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@S limit in hearts with spades|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|bagman: The open room is playing board 65 so we'll be live soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: I just had a nice tenderloin with new potatoes..no ketchup:)|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W can win 3NT |pg||
nt|jtmckee: 4 s can be beat with a d tap|pg||
mb|3D|an|alert|nt|bessi2: did that actually happen ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: x probably just showing minimum|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure east would have accepted with @dk instead of @c Q so this was a very good decision by diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm 4@H needs care|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: which one Jay?|pg||
nt|karesz:  1 @s balanced 8-12|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chessmaste: Well I don't think much of the second double, but E/W should emerge with a plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Now the @DA and a low back|pg||
nt|viren169: spade lead may defeat 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if duck first trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I must confess that I would have blackwooded in a heartbeat|pg||
nt|passell: good 6nt on the bidding|pg||
nt|ybob: or second trick too|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he can play low, he is in 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you paly that the cuebid promises 3 spades the west should bid 3@S over 3@H to suggest a poor quality @H suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: same auction in other room|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see two probable heart losers; he cannot afford not to finesse|pg||
nt|puncher99: 3n was cold|pg||
nt|jtmckee: so good result for n-s|pg||
nt|karesz:  3 @d show distribution 3-4-2-4|pg||
nt|karesz:  @h is the best lead, but decl has 9 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: marked @C possition 3 @S 5@C 3@D 1@H|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ybob: win and @D ...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bessi2: indeed... seems to be by far the safest line|pg||

nt|passell: good sing 10 of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wb Mike|pg||

nt|frankaus: g'day mike|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chessmaste: Covering was a mistake I fear|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes,  and in a spot where playing low was pretty standard|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gulyas: indeed|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: sneaky|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|viren169: with the @cs breaking 3@D looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bessi2: I can't get over the bidding.. let alone west's second dbl which is bad imo, but east sitting in the dbl is beyond my understanding|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bagman: I think that the low heart was an illusory safety play|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|puncher99: run the spades now|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: the contract is cold|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: some invert the meanings of pass & double in forcing pass situations|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|karesz:  12-16 balanced, if 16 no 4-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: just more random quiet hands here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|jtmckee: makes 5d n-s|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3nt looks likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl seems natural|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfj: was not doubvled need to correct|pg||
nt|benjent: NS are going to have to tread carefully here|pg||
nt|bagman: A bit untypical weak two with void, 4 controls and just a so-so suit; in strong club context 1@H could be considered|pg||
nt|ybob: 140 here|pg||
nt|viren169: best to pass with a mis-fit|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow he passed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|karesz:  a lot of tricks now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|passell: yes 3nt very likely|pg||
nt|passell: maybe 4nt|pg||
nt|benjent: 2@s was GF, but Kranyak will still feel he has plenty in reserve|pg||
nt|passell: very difficult for Kran to pass here|pg||
nt|benjent: Yeah, easy 4@c bid|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Oh well|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump switch?|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed pekka|pg||
nt|ybob: 11 now|pg||
nt|viren169: defense need to be quick to hold it to 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|viren169: but not on that lead!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|passell: maybe he will pass 4nt  very difficult|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|benjent: I like 4@h ... if Wolpert gets the message. His intention is clearly to say "excellent @c's, @h control, bit worried about them there @d's"|pg||
nt|passell: no more plus score available dont see a 10th trick in nt|pg||
nt|benjent: But without explicit suit agreement, this is the kind of auction that can descend into a series of cue-or-signoffs very quickly|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like the same 11 tricks as the OR|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if he play to 11, K@D @S to  k@S and low @C ?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@h will make easily enough|pg||
nt|passell: with the normal dia lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a little bit passive from W in my opinion|pg||
pc|d4|nt|benjent: They'll be lucky to escape a X now|pg||
nt|passell: the dbl is about to begin|pg||
nt|passell: I predict 6nt dbl down 2|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Hamson will X 6@C|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's cheapest action now is the impossible pass :)|pg||
nt|passell: or 6nt|pg||
nt|passell: dont like forcing to slam  too likely partner has a stiff club|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chessmaste: The 5-1 trump break will annoy declarer, but the contract is in no danger |pg||
pc|d3|nt|passell: would bid this way with the Q of clubs |pg||
nt|frankaus: no X  :)|pg||
nt|benjent: And with the Red preempt, likely that @c aren't breaking kindly|pg||
nt|passell: yes |pg||
nt|passell: he may be thinking of 6nt to protect ruffs and the dia Q|pg||
nt|passell: seems like he should  now the dbl will come|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|karesz:  against a 15-17 NT W will have invitation hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 points and a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|karesz:  or gameforcing:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|passell: dbl for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has 2 spades, diamond and 4 hearts going one down against a careful defense|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|passell: down 1 likely now|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3-1-1-1 tricks, cannot see anything else|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is likely to come up short|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|benjent: The problem with 6NT is that you may actually be exposing the @dQ rather than protecting it. The red pre-empter could easily have @dK given your @h strength (and partner's @h ...|pg||
nt|benjent: stopper to boot)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|passell: maybe down 1 hampson may not be greedy if they play dia at trick 2|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|ybob: now 10|pg||
nt|karesz:  11 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jtmckee: so down 2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|passell: double dummy can duck a club and squeeze north|pg||
nt|passell: yes  true  but protecting the ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence are now in control|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jtmckee: 1|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bessi2: north must force dummy with the king of @c to hold declarer to 9 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gulyas: ty Mr GIB:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|passell: easier seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|benjent: 2 off? Kranyak's just going to pump @c's and accept a certain fate I would think|pg||

nt|frankaus: another interesting lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: break|pg||
nt|roswolf: good result for diamond in the other room|pg||
nt|bagman: A partscore hand which probably belongs to NS. EW can take 6 tricks in NT in defense|pg||
nt|bagman: The nice lie of the red suits gives declarer 3 hearts and 4 diamonds|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|bagman: The system of Cohen-Smith was not available on the USBF web site; anybody know what they play?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: yes|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|bessi2: I am not a big fan of south's pass here|pg||
nt|bagman: The club J is also onside so declarer can make 2 club tricks and come to 7 with 3 hearts, 2 clubs and 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: really 1@D by east!?|pg||
nt|bagman: The latter line probably needs some entry help from the defense|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|Walddk4: 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: it has its advantages surely.. but definately not my style|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I would open - 2@S weak, or 2@D Multi,or 2@S spades and a minor|pg||
nt|frankaus: did wolpert bid @H opp?|pg||
nt|karesz:  balanced 8-10 i think|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|frankaus: will it end in 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I  like upgrading this south hand to a 2N opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am a big fan of rebidding 1NT with unbal hands that are short in pd's major, but it backfires when you cannot bid 2M with a mangy 5c suit, frearing a singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: yes, as i know it|pg||
nt|jtmckee: seems cold at first glance|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this one seems cold at first glance|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@C mixed raise in @Ds|pg||
nt|karesz:  relay|pg||
nt|karesz:  2 @d 4-crad @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW will probably bid 3nt on this board. A not so good 3nt as previous|pg||
nt|karesz:  and a 4-card minor|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: ah more understandable|pg||
nt|jtmckee: best lead|pg||
nt|caitlin: and ofte singleton trump not good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: good point, that is my style too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So 3@H is stronger than 4 as 2@H was GF|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the defense can take 6 tricks: 3 hearts 2 diamonds and a club to beat |pg||
nt|caitlin: often|pg||
nt|jtmckee: will have to husband his entrys|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this seems a fair slam|pg||
nt|puncher99: trump lead beats it 2 trks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: probably 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can only see 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bagman: The heart slam requires the trumps to behave|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith actually held up 1 finger for 5@d, guess it's clear from the auction he doesn't have 4 keycards :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have thankfully missed the 4-4 @Cfit|pg||
nt|bagman: NT slam has extra chances in clubs|pg||

nt|bagman: This requires the heart switch in trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may be difficult to find|pg||
nt|bagman: otherwise E might be able to discard a heart and ruff a heart in dummy|pg||
nt|karesz:  against @s lead|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Looks like a simple two down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks, coffee break:)|pg||
nt|passell: good 3nt by larsen   even if partner had 3 spades he might get beat in trumps  he has so much on the outside|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|caitlin: apparently 3@C mixed raise in @C and @Ds|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gulyas: I never see the point in leading a singleton in an unbid suit against notrump|pg||
nt|roswolf: not too much to the play|pg||
nt|sommer: this is a great contract|pg||
nt|bagman: The club slam is the worst requiring the clubs to be 3-2 with Q onside (or Q singleton)|pg||
nt|sommer: no..it's easy..and will be copied most places|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it needs trumps 3-2 which is not really great|pg||
nt|roswolf: acccurate wd|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|chessmaste: But declarer must attack the side suit first|pg||
nt|bessi2: if Deutch had opened 2@s, Diamond might overcall 2N which would not have been a pleasant contract to play|pg||
nt|gulyas: not that it matters here|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak's got a plausible X, but I think it has a bit to do with how his set is going as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: X ruff from here|pg||

nt|granguru: HI|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N could have had a better situation if he first had bid 2@c |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bessi2: n-s not on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|ybob: or X from E|pg||
nt|viren169: or P P dble|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello John|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: tough but makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D a lucky make|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to find the @CQ in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be routine , i think, but you never know|pg||
nt|karesz:  but then E culd not bid @h|pg||
nt|karesz:  could|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes the layout is fairly kind to declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs 5 club tricks to pitch 2 hearts; he cannot make if W has Q9xx so should guess the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah now that makes it certain|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: easier now|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 3rd|pg||
nt|granguru: Well the double permited E to bid @H. that was the moment where NS got out of troubles (supposely)|pg||
nt|karesz:  can be this 4 @h natural?|pg||
nt|karesz:  can N believe it?|pg||
nt|granguru: what else?|pg||
nt|karesz:  cue with @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: he will get the @h right, cannot lose to E twice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: knew that moved but wasnt sure about the river part|pg||
nt|sommer: @DQ 3rd or 4th makes it for Fred|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in N|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like declarer needs all the diamonds. He can get them but entries are short and this might require quite accurate play|pg||
nt|viren169: East taking the low road!|pg||
nt|viren169: North will hopeful respect the bidding...|pg||
nt|ybob: if S has 6@C and pd 4333 2@H was the good bid|pg||
nt|viren169: if South had an opening they would pass...|pg||
nt|ybob: not opening but 6@C decent|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: he should start hearts |pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that takes care of it|pg||
nt|benjent: Taken with the @c overcall, Greco will think that's a short @h lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Left to his own devices, he would like to work on the minors before drawing trumps, but that's not where he is|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping to put partner in for a heart thru|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bagman: Now one more entry to dummy helps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman: "leads are?" Smith "4th best"|pg||
nt|karesz:  no, it was natural for Hegedus|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|granguru: well it is in fact a makeable contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gulyas: now he only needs 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|benjent: A mid-range alternative is to draw two rounds of trumps then try @d's|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|viren169: this wont be pretty...|pg||
nt|ybob: don´t like 2NT|pg||
nt|ybob: with xxx @S|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a pass to me...|pg||
nt|ybob: pd denies 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h2|nt|bagman: Now declarer runs the @DT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|passell: oops |pg||
nt|gulyas: with 3221 for sure|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Greco will not assay the @D position after this lead|pg||
nt|passell: interesting not to lead a high club  worked well as declarer placed his partner with 1 of the top honors|pg||
nt|benjent: Drawing all the trumps then playing @d's is risky - if you get them wrong, they can play on @c's, force out West's last trump and be ready to pounce with a @d and @c trick later|pg||
nt|ybob: -100 instead  win 140|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|frankaus: wil lose just 2@D and @C|pg||
nt|benjent: Greco's still going to be in the position where he can't draw all the trumps ... so I reckon he will draw 2, and then play the @dK, hating it all the way|pg||
nt|sommer: no:)|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 light if North ducks 2 rounds of hearts...|pg||
nt|caitlin: Wolfson 200  Aker 180 or so-------Wolfson playing w Larry Cohen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with no entry on W - just give E 2 @h tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: can ruff low...to be overruffed means W has 9 @D, clearly not for  the bidding|pg||
nt|granguru: from* the bidding|pg||
nt|granguru: @HK|pg||
nt|karesz:  SSzabo had opened, so he has @cQ, no problem in the play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first @cA/K and then @hK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course @cA or @cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for a later finess ....|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bagman: A good try and a good bet S holding one spade and partner 5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bagman: Smith covered in the hope that Cohen had the 9|pg||
nt|roswolf: nae bother as a scottish friend of mine would say|pg||
nt|sommer: he will just take the @D's and play a small @H now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: Gitelman cannot be sure that the spades really are 4-2; the lead might have been false|pg||
nt|bagman: 4-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: not very likely though|pg||
nt|sommer: so?..does a @H finesse help then?|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart finesse does not help then, that's true|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is the 9th trick:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer was taking the club finesse to the safe hand protecting the @HK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gulyas: @Ss will be cleared|pg||
nt|passell: he will now have to guess well|pg||
nt|gulyas: cash @DAK and then finesse in @Hs? has to give up a @H trick first|pg||
nt|passell: likely as long as he doesnt run clubs first|pg||
nt|karesz:  no finesse:)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A strange misunderstanding|pg||
nt|viren169: @d now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sommer: so is the small:)..and no @C suit opened|pg||
nt|bagman: If spades are 5-2 and heart finesse works, declarer can afford to play @HQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jtmckee: east going to take the rest|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: if he does, he will see W started with 4-4 in the blacks|pg||
nt|caitlin: by East?|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 12 only|pg||
nt|jtmckee: has to take the d finess to make ten|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bagman: and if the @HK is with south with original 5 spades, the contract is going down anyway|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: making him less likely to hold @H length, hence getting the finesse right|pg||
nt|psyck: as Mike pointed out, starting on @h would have given him more chances, if he could knock out the entry to the long @s hand|pg||
nt|passell: 10 of clubs a misprint|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably played a low @C|pg||
nt|sommer: wow..they missed the "easy" slam in OR|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|caitlin: Board 110 Gitelman bid/made 5@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: has he played?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no, is it still friday|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this hand had one intersting thing for sure|pg||
nt|jtmckee: he led low|pg||
nt|caitlin: Eric!!!!|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 4th best|pg||
nt|caitlin: has he played to dummy yet!!|pg||
nt|jtmckee: had he led 3rd  best and kept all his diamonds   declarer might play him for a dbltn rather than length|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no no no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: will be time problems if they don't move faster|pg||
nt|caitlin: true Jay|pg||
nt|ralfwil: crossruff:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gulyas: ?|pg||

nt|viren169: N/S didnt get in...|pg||
nt|viren169: what was 2@d?|pg||

nt|viren169: i see...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bessi2: 3N for n-s.. and at this time I don't see any reason for declarer to misguess @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|swanson: Greco really wants a club lead, but he can't stand a diamond lead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss did|pg||
nt|roswolf: well maybe e/w are going overboard?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, he did|pg||
nt|bagman: If 4NT is the right bid, 4@S was wrong (or vice versa)|pg||
nt|sommer: only chance in 5@S is a squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Although with all the running around I did to try to get this computer on the internet and not lose any other table, I certainly could miss a pass or two here and there :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..the minorsqueeze against N|pg||
nt|roswolf: west fell in love with his 2 aces|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chessmaste: 3NT is the obvious call |pg||
nt|jtmckee: diamond team playing strong right now|pg||
nt|caitlin: bd 11 Moss Xed in 4@S making|pg||

nt|bagman: Did West really pass?|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were wet here imo a reopening double would have got them into the auction|pg||
nt|viren169: the vul and the 2@d bid kept N/S at bay!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sommer: ..3?|pg||
nt|roswolf: it appears so pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: I admit that W holds a bad hand and they are vulnerable but still he's holding a reasonable spade suit and doubleton heart|pg||
pc|h6|nt|benjent: Unfortunately, we got dropped out at an interesting point in the play on the last, but I assume Greco managed it smoothly|pg||
nt|sommer: + Q:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Lead problem|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 keycards, actually|pg||
nt|roswolf: well so i cant count or perhaps type:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bagman: @CK creates a parking place for the diamond loser|pg||
nt|sommer: always makeable I guess|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes but may work out ok|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jtmckee: looks like Dallas vs the lakers|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|bessi2: i wonder if Larsen will try to sneak a @h to the king right away|pg||

nt|bessi2: Larsen has to cash his 5 winners, otherwise he will wind up with only 4 it seems|pg||
nt|sommer: 9 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bagman: N cannot pass as 2@H is limited only by the inability to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chimera of the vul game bonus tempts north|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss asks Cohen if he had another way to raise 2@h to 3@h and Cohen says no|pg||
nt|bagman: N could have bid 2NT for the minors but 3@C is lead directing and normally also a good trump suit (facing a normal X=T/O)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|benjent: 9 tricks here ... but 6 losers first|pg||
nt|passell: 5 needed imps for deutsch|pg||

nt|sommer: Cohen doesn't like it right now..I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed not clear how 3@S fares|pg||
nt|taliga: E can not tell how many... could have been 4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chessmaste: With clubs 4-1 he would need to find East with @D K10 doubleton|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bagman: Everything else is friendly so S is unlikely to go down here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|benjent: Get some attitude (just in case) and also make sure partner returns the right thing|pg||
nt|passell: hampson hoping he has only 2|pg||
nt|ybob: S has 2 moves, @H or low @S ...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ybob: now K @D and 8 @H  ...|pg||
nt|ybob: if duck N play @S ...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bessi2: 4@s make but may be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to guess the spades, avoid losing control and manage the diamonds (with ruff or luck)|pg||
nt|viren169: declarer will duck this expecting diamonds to be 5-3|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|karesz:  and it could be enough|pg||
nt|taliga: 3? :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ybob: with 5@D on N he bids 2@D over 2@C|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|viren169: easy for us to see... looking at all 4 hands|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bagman: Deutch probably going plus in both rooms again|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks to be drifting -1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chessmaste: Now declarer thinks 'Might East have ducked with @DK7?' - Not a chance so he cashes out|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bagman: Taking the easy tricks for book|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is a bit unhappy but he really cannot go down on any sensible line he might take|pg||

pc|c9|nt|ybob: can´ t win if A @D on N |pg||
pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: all tired here|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: this is am exciting lot |pg||
nt|bagman: A solid slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Hampson will be wondering if slam is on. The @d overcall is good news, really|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@D looks a cinch to bid|pg||
nt|karesz:  he had easy 10 and made hard 9|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|bagman: Both holding good looking two suiters|pg||
nt|roswolf: but which slam?|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 12 tricks in both diamonds and NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Might have some communication problems in NT with heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room e/w never got to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|bagman: @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: a relay sequence should do the trick here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: I would not pass the South hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting pass from Deutsch here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 4 corrected|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is possiblr here|pg||
nt|bagman: But nothing unsolvable; take @H diamonds and then @SQ|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|benjent: No way is Hampson going to sit for that|pg||
nt|frankaus: no entry to  8 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@D, 6NT..or maybe even 7@D?|pg||
nt|bagman: Soon they will know about the misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: a bidding challenge for n-s here.. to avoid the tempting 3N for the 11 trick gamecontract|pg||
nt|karesz:  1 @c Precision|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|chessmaste: 2@D looks like a limited 3 suiter|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  one of my two favorite opening bid conventions|pg||
nt|chessmaste: With N/S cold for 5@D this is not par so far|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is easy watching all 4 hands. but imo Larsen should protect here,  |pg||
nt|bessi2: could be disastrous, but you lose to many partscore swings by passing I think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps, and certainly if South is allowed to pass with this type of hand|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT was bad news for Hampson (wasted @d card in his partner's limited hand) and he's sensibly focussing on game|pg||
nt|bagman: But they have lots of cards and a reasonable diamond fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes fortune will favor the brave here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@D the only making game|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing diamonds i suppose and if so 4@D MUST BE A SLAM TRY|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok so is 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW SLAM IS EASY PEASEY|pg||
nt|bagman: Not even trying to guess what's going on here biddingwise|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C precision, 1@S  i think positive unbal but not sure|pg||
nt|ybob: 8/11|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bessi2: I am not saying I would bid, I am somewhat of a chicken in these spots, I am saying one should|pg||
nt|passell: they are there|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D save? |pg||
nt|viren169: all routes lead to 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|karesz:  the others is not known by me|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|chessmaste: South could have staretd with either minor, or used a gadget - say 2@H a three suiter always with hearts   |pg||
nt|frankaus: green V gren saves not real value|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D looks like a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: @D is the trump suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: guess 3@S would be 4th suit, so N saved it|pg||

nt|bagman: 4@H could be kickback but could also be something else|pg||
nt|granguru: sorry private|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: He is relieved|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or even reprieved|pg||
nt|gulyas: well done|pg||
nt|benjent: How to get back to hand? A @d ruff is not 100% safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: to be bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman writing questions to Cohen, but I can't quite make it out - sorry|pg||
nt|bagman: Grand is possible but on a trump lead it might be a bit tricky to play|pg||
nt|sommer: S doesn't know about the @Cvoid, so he may go for the grand|pg||
nt|karesz:  5 @c is the limit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|passell: good lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Hampson did well to avoid a spade lead - that would put a lot of pressure on West to find the overtake and club shift.|pg||
nt|roswolf: NICELY BID|pg||
nt|bagman: The play is no problem|pg||
nt|puncher99: cashout time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Declarer will claim in a moment|pg||

nt|roswolf: 5nt may get north bidding 7@D|pg||
nt|bagman: I'd like to be in 6@S where I can draw trumps and then pass the @ST :)|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D|pg||
nt|bagman: Or pass the @ST and then draw trumps |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: hard to mis guess diamonds as only 1 4 -1 break is useful|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|passell: club now|pg||
nt|benjent: As it happens, he can't go wrong on the 2nd round of @d's, since the @h10 is short onside|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert may ruff the 2nd @c ... maybe a bit of uppercutting, chance to try a @d to promote partner's @h's|pg||
nt|taliga: boring 3N instead|pg||
nt|karesz:  16-16 after 9 boards|pg||

pc|h8|nt|jtmckee: theres 8|pg||

nt|jtmckee: and at Yankee stadium, mississippi state bulldog Jon Pappelbon takes the mound vs the evil empire|pg||
nt|jtmckee: he must duck this else the d has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jtmckee: and if he does they can attack his heart entry|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|passell: a tricky 3 rounds of hearts is the only chance|pg||
nt|sommer: S has a lot of trick potential..6@D looks a little puss..|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 7 it was|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK SOUTH JUST BID IT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen " I've got some holes" Smith: "you've got some too?"|pg||
nt|bagman: THis might take some time|pg||
nt|sommer: N has to take a few deep breaths...but the lucky lie of the cards may help him through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinks so too - he's gone for coffee :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well we can see both ordinary finesses work|pg||
nt|bagman: There are 11 tricks with one ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: remember..S has no entry after @Hfinesse!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i dont see how he can avoid taking at least 1|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might win this in dummy and then take the ordinary spade finesse and hope to ruff down the king|pg||
nt|sommer: .. he MUST run @S10 for sure|pg||
nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that looks the more practical line |pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: If the @SK does not come down, he has some chances left in hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gowdy: :) thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Greco could almost bid 1NT without looking at his hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Not much in play here; declarer loses two hearts and the spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen played very quickly from dummy and Moss said "too fast" - so Cohen waited a moment and then played and Moss said "still too fast" Cohen: "sorry"|pg||
nt|sommer: a practical 4@S from N..and he's awarded with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sommer: quite lucky, but ok|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much N can do; he either makes this or not (losing to 4-1 spades or uppercut/overruf)|pg||
nt|sommer: it's only around 33% but 4@S is "the bid"|pg||
nt|bagman: If E cashes a heart and plays a club; N might wonder weather to play @SK from hand or go to dummy and play a spade to pick up A singleton onside and risk diamond ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman took the @h A out, but now has folded his hand up again|pg||
nt|bagman: 1@H looks like no 5M, no 6m with positive values|pg||

nt|gulyas: this will not test declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: a trump lead would have prolonged the play|pg||
nt|sommer: @H for @C's?|pg||
nt|viren169: West didnt raise because East is limited|pg||
nt|viren169: 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|benjent: The 2nd @c trick gets Greco up to 6, and the @s finesse will make it 7|pg||

nt|jtmckee: yes it is|pg||

nt|sommer: @H2..|pg||
nt|roswolf: creaking to the obvious contract|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bagman: This is the best lead and declarer might have some difficulties as he's probably giving up a club |pg||
nt|bagman: then a diamond back and defense set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: win and lead a heart following with the club finesse looks very natural|pg||
nt|gowdy: note the lead @H 2  so S thinks  they are 44 or W has the length|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss was thinking about overtaking the club, so Smith showed his hand and asked "how do I do?"|pg||

nt|bagman: S scores 3 trump tricks and N the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: Cohen probably disapointed after the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: but in the other room i doubt e/w will be in game|pg||
nt|bagman: @CA, @S to !K|pg||
nt|sommer: @SA + 3 @Htricks is the strange outcome of best play|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|bessi2: @d J,  @c to the jack and queen,  east better play another @d there otherwise easy 8 tricks|pg||

nt|roswolf: dd i think maybe -2|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chessmaste: East is after an entry in the Bulletin - except there isn't one|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sommer: I agreed to that -2|pg||
nt|bagman: W eloping with the small trumps; he knows the hearts are likely to be 5-0|pg||
nt|roswolf: re|pg||
nt|sommer: The Italian waiter struck again!!|pg||
nt|bagman: The club ruff was too early as S can discard a diamond on the next club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sorry, slightly flakey internet connection too - you'd think with 4 choices I could find one that was solid :)|pg||
nt|sommer: right..thats why it's -2 now|pg||
nt|sommer: you havent been a waiter in Italy, do you, Susan?:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N needs to take this and play a club for a diamond discard; if W wins this, he should take his two diamond tricks as long as he can|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Actually, this is Jan - I switched with Susan when we couldn't get Susan's computer on the internet; haven't been a waiter any place|pg||
nt|roswolf: natural to win i think|pg||
nt|sommer: ok:)|pg||
nt|bagman: S can hold @SK and QJT98 of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: We're at trick 5 now - did something not get through (still worrying about connection :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room the grand is being played in 4@H!!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: FROZEN AT TRICK 3|pg||
nt|sommer: "The Italian waiter" is a BBO "thing"...from a vue-graff in Italy some years ago, where a waiter fell over the pc cables and turned all off |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss deciding whether to take the diamond finesse - if he hadn't been doubled, of course he'd need it for 4 (losing 2 hearts and a spade) but doubled, he knows hearts aren't ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: breaking|pg||
nt|bagman: Diamond lucky in the grand hand because 4@H does not lose much more than 6@D would lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: jan what happened at t3 did north win @SA?|pg||
nt|bagman: That also shows why on IMPs dubious grands should not be bid; the opps might end up in game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I'll keep playing out the hand and then if it doesn't get through to you, I'll have to close and start again and hope I can do better. But spade to A, Club Q on which S pitched a ...|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||

pc|h6|nt|benjent: Without the @c lead, declarer has to fall back on the @d finesse when @c's don't break. With this lead, he can actually pick up the @c's|pg||

pc|hK|nt|benjent: If he's got the moxy for it. Bit risky, so here comes the @d finesse|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||

nt|benjent: The @h6 pitch should help|pg||
nt|bagman: N had a natural diamond lead without the overcall|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|benjent: NS play upside down signals, with suit preference tendencies "if we think partner will be able to work it out"|pg||
nt|benjent: So Kranyak has been busy suit preferencing for @s's, hoping that partner will be able to work it out|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert will be thinking - if declarer has @hA, he'l have 9 tricks, so I'll have to hope the @s's cash|pg||

nt|roswolf: a pass the buck bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this is rightsided|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nickell 236  Bathurst 277|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: is that final?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: and gains the 8th trick|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..and will probably make!|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9th|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen asks for a review of the auction|pg||
nt|sommer: with @DJ falling thats 9|pg||
nt|bagman: S did not X 3@S because he expected a spade lead on the auction|pg||
nt|caitlin: no Lebensohl so DONT but Gavin must think 2@H better than 2@D???|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D was better|pg||
nt|caitlin: noooooo|pg||
nt|caitlin: Wolfson 212 Acker 192 not final|pg||
nt|gowdy: My dogs are telling me they want to walk ,,,, see you all tomorrow  ( if it rains)  no golf|pg||
nt|caitlin: open room on bd 114|pg||
nt|jtmckee: good nite|pg||
nt|caitlin: night:) ty|pg||
nt|karesz:  i do not understand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|benjent: Is it playable? Sure, but he'll need to pull off some magic in the @c suit|pg||
nt|benjent: Curiously, Hampson probably had to unblock the @s's at trick to be able to make on the layout (so that he could force a 2nd entry to table)|pg||
nt|benjent: at trick 1, that is|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the defense has 7 tricks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@c was majors i think|pg||
nt|karesz:  Why did not West bid 3 spdes? Why bid East 3 spades?|pg||
nt|karesz:  so why did east bid 2 @d instead 2 @s?|pg||
nt|karesz:  of|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bessi2: tricky hand to defend.. I predict 110|pg||
nt|bessi2: it actually seems that this contract is unbeatable|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bagman: and often it's a bad idea to X probes giving away bidding space|pg||
nt|roswolf: but of course the defence can cash out but i have my doubts|pg||
nt|bagman: or 8|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H X is the second best contract|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|jtmckee: hello ira|pg||
nt|caitlin: Welcome Ira|pg||
pc|dT|nt|benjent: I reckon Hampson now expects the @cK to be with North ... South has shown a lot of cards|pg||
nt|caitlin: so at other table 2@H E-W and here N-S!!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|benjent: But with only only clear entry to the board, he's playing for @cJ to be with South|pg||
nt|roswolf: serves him right - always make things easy for your ox opposite!|pg||
nt|ybob: better 2@D i think|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much left for Moss to try: he needs now diamonds running |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinking, we didn't lose connection again :)|pg||
nt|sommer: the @Cplay was an extra chance to the @D's ..hoping @C are 3-3, if @D dont work|pg||
nt|roswolf: no time pressure is there?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen: "sorry" - he's been moving the spade 2, spade 7 and club 10 into playing position |pg||
nt|bagman: This is KO and they are two boards ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Of course they don't know about the other table, but I'm pretty sure there isn't any time problem (each table is screened off so we can't see the clocks in the middle of the room ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: but could move the curtains aside and look if wanted to|pg||
nt|roswolf: best chance for south is to switch to@S isnt it?|pg||
nt|bagman: DD, yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Director just announced 20 minutes, so definitely no time problems|pg||
nt|bagman: But S might think that W holds the Q and N better hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: He probably shoots back a low club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Wonder if S can tell that the @h Q at trick 1 was a falsecard (in the sense that he must have had either ten or nine) so know that W didn't want a shift?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen has now moved a diamond to the end of his hand - considering going passive?|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point but i cnat see how a club or a diamond could lead to 4 more reicks for defence|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: almost played the @s 7|pg||
nt|roswolf: tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He might hope for 8 or less for declarer instead of getting 5 or more for the defense :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is likely that diamonds are favorable for declarer so he must generate tricks elsewhere|pg||
nt|caitlin: next last board here.....open much slower|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: how could anyone be slower:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Bathurst has defeated Nickell|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: congrats to Bathhurst|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: perhaps i dont now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|benjent: Good @h return - I reckon that was tough after the @s lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's been playing along quite nicely in this set|pg||
nt|benjent: This is probably going to sail 2 or 3 off now|pg||
nt|caitlin: still @H ruff in 2@D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|benjent: Kranyak should clear the @h's, Hampson will take the @c finesse as his best shot at 9 tricks, and the roof will cave in shortly afterwards|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i can see the cards south cant - which is why it would be fascinating to hear his thoughts|pg||
nt|ybob: the best was 1@H but this made W :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|taliga: the bid seems more reasonable if W showed 6 cards of @ss :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bagman: EW could have taken the same 8 tricks in spades for 110 instead of 100 in this contract|pg||
nt|caitlin: won't make yet again|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bagman: Now Moss takes his only chance for the contract|pg||

pc|c2|pc|s7|pc|c9|nt|taliga: Anyhow, they did it well to bid the game: having h!Q and @sK onside, getting the favorable @d lead... :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jtmckee: billy cogniant of his spots but has to save the d to stuff him in|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|bagman: Now the happy sight and claim|pg||
nt|caitlin: better to disc small @C I think,,,,,,,|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: on 72 deutsch gained 12 when 3@DX went -2|pg||
nt|jtmckee: going down|pg||
nt|jtmckee: nothng he could do|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphzfj: actually he played 10 at trick 1|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: these quarter-final matches resume tomorrow, about 14 hours from now (10 local time)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should quickly go down|pg||
nt|bagman: This surely goes down but is it going down one or two|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss: "sorry partner"|pg||
nt|roswolf: although if south opens up the @S suit....|pg||
nt|bagman: Now win the ace and a low club and see if the defense takes the tricks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: A lot of total IMPs this set!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman asks to look at NS convention card|pg||
nt|bagman: After the defense grabs the first 4 heart tricks, declarer has 7 tricks ready and can build one more in diamonds for an overtick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|caitlin: 3@D asks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also lucku with @sJ10|pg||

pc|d5|nt|bessi2: wow.. that 3@s is one serious underbid in my opinion.. but at first glance it looks successful|pg||
nt|caitlin: sure|pg||
pc|dT|nt|benjent: Kranyak's accept is marginal, Wolpert's invite is marginal, the @s break is poor, and this is going to sail off|pg||

nt|jtmckee: ty ms caitlin|pg||
nt|chorush: 4H making 4 will be a push and end a hard fought match with a Diamond vctory|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|bagman: Cohen should go up the Q|pg||

nt|caitlin: sorry agreed re: @S:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: lots of hands:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: serious 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@C  void |pg||
nt|caitlin: asking to cue|pg||
nt|caitlin: or 3N mild slam try...one or other depending on their agreement|pg||
nt|caitlin: W can cue @HK|pg||
nt|ybob: serious 3NT|pg||
nt|swanson: I think 3@C = min, 3@D inquiry; 3@S void somewhere; 3NT = where?, 4@C = clubs.|pg||
nt|petergill: Greco in the tank, thinking about how to find @d control, and at same time check for enough controls = cannot do both? - has to guess what to do?|pg||
nt|petergill: I was commentating at other table in this match... where same problem arose |pg||
nt|caitlin: lol:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he can stand to go to 5@S though, unless partner has really filthy trumps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|caitlin: why X??|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ybob: now XX = A@H and @D cue|pg||

nt|caitlin: paych|pg||
nt|caitlin: psych|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: 4@H, bypassing 4@D, identifies the @d problem to his partner|pg||

pc|c4|nt|benjent: This is the last board of the set. Restart is in ... about 10 minutes I think|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: nv he does not care wherefrom the @SQ comes down|pg||
nt|ybob: if W denies it|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|caitlin: hard slam to bid without knowing partner's exact shape|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing 1st and 2nd round cue bids, East must have @d control for the Rdbl, else Easthe signs off in 4@s, knowing two @d lsoers exist |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|swanson: The Larry Cohen version of Jacoby as published in Bulletin last year is 3@C all minimums.  Probably in use by E-W.|pg||

nt|ybob: E could be push another, good cards |pg||
nt|petergill: Playing Precision with light openings, West was worried that partner had Q109xx, Axxxx, KQx void, and the Dbl meant a heart ruff awaited 5@S|pg||
nt|ybob: to me W bid well|pg||
nt|ybob: but not sure if E did|pg||
nt|ybob: 2NT = 4 cards supp , 3NT = serious, 4@H = cue over 4@C shows void ... |pg||
nt|ybob: he needs make a waiting bid 4@S|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bessi2: it was difficult for Larsen to resist the temptation for the ruff there|pg||
nt|bessi2: nearly impossible|pg||
pc|h9|nt|benjent: Assigning the blame for this, I'd say majority North. 3@h is just too pushy after a plain 2@s raise|pg||
nt|benjent: The @d's finesse was desperate, and has cost him an extra undertrick|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|taliga: The game is originally alright if the @dA and at least one black ace is onside. Having both @s and @c ace at W, he needs the @s miracle with the J and 10|pg||
