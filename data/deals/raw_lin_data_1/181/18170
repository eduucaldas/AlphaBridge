nt|vugraphzgp: hello all|pg||
nt|mango joe: Sure but I dont think the Pakistani ladies have ever been a match for the Indians, unlike the men in which they are a lot closer|pg||
nt|alok_daga: India playing precision style as far as I know|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: n/s playing std|pg||
nt|mango joe: The bridge players have always been good friends as they should be which is nice|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: some might upgrade and open 1n with South hand, I prefer simple 1@s as at this table|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|rv: North's hand is perfect for t/o double of 3@c if N-S play double here as t/o|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|s9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rv: if North had doubled 3@c for t/o, South has an interesting bidding problem, he has extras and all working cards but no big fit|pg||
nt|alok_daga: they will maybe then reach 3nt|pg||
nt|mango joe: if N/S are playing standard then why not 2@H from N?|pg||
nt|mango joe: and surely its normal to play X of 3@C as t/o in this position|pg||
nt|alok_daga: she cant go wrong in 3hrts|pg||
nt|mango joe: can still make 5 now |pg||
nt|alok_daga: 5?|pg||
nt|mango joe: @H now followed by hook in @D|pg||
nt|rv: I like double as t/o especially sitting underneath 3@c bidder, can't get very rich playing penalties|pg||
nt|mango joe: 4@H + 2 @D tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: director call|pg||
nt|ehsana: hello all :)..teh big match on :):)|pg||
