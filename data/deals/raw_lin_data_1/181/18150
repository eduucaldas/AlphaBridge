nt|granguru: lets say N has @CK and stiff @DA or @DK|pg||
mb|p|nt|csabi: indeed, the bad decision was East's 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|csabi: West's I mean|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|csabi: what an overcall|pg||
nt|csabi: no suit, less than opening strength|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|granguru: other option was to have found @DQJ, when the 10 would have been a solid stopper|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|csabi: hard to lead @D-s into the opener|pg||
nt|csabi: normally it is a 4+ suit|pg||
nt|syl: still down isnt it|pg||
nt|csabi: only on 3rd and 4th place can be shorter|pg||
nt|syl: it WAS 3. place|pg||
nt|csabi: isn't the north hand an opening?|pg||
nt|granguru: after any lead but a @H defense can still prevail|pg||
nt|csabi: what do you think?|pg||
nt|syl: Imho 3sp over 2nt should show 6 hearts and good hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|syl: borderline opening|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|granguru: zar points: 11+9 (longest) + 5(long-shortest) ´+ 3(ctrl)=28|pg||
nt|granguru: not borderline|pg||
nt|granguru: minimum is 26|pg||
nt|csabi: ok, and what is the Zar requiremnet to open?|pg||
nt|csabi: ok|pg||
nt|syl: is Zar sort of Bible? :)|pg||
nt|granguru: so it is, according to zar (and probably any evaluation system) a real opening hand|pg||
nt|granguru: yes zar is one of the most precise evaluation methods I have met..together with Kaplans|pg||

pc|c7|nt|syl: bec the 2h bid uppgraded his hand|pg||
nt|csabi: 3@H perhaps?|pg||
nt|syl: be honest it DID and they had game in h|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: but not sure I understand why he didn't start with a dbl|pg||

pc|c6|nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|passell: looks like deutch had his rose colored glasses on here|pg||
nt|gulyas: really, a simple double followed by a cue sould have been enough|pg||
nt|gulyas: or at least pass the 4@S|pg||
nt|passell: might have defended 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|bessi2: unfortunately we didn't get to see Larsen's decision over 2@h dbl|pg||
nt|gulyas: its only 500|pg||
nt|bessi2: I prefer pass,  but it is by no means automatic in my view|pg||
nt|passell: against 450 or 420|pg||
pc|h8|nt|puncher99: welcome to the spectators and the operator|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: ah he didnt play the ace|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hello all.|pg||
nt|taliga: We start the second section with a dull 4@h|pg||
nt|taliga: Hi Rodal|pg||
pc|d4|nt|passell: his only legitimate make is both dia honors onside|pg||
nt|passell: or catching 3 spades in the weak 2 bidders hand|pg||
nt|psyck: At this vul, 2@h-x-pass could well be the favorite|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: with the cards this favorable game might conceiveably be made|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|passell: looks like down 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: he could make with W having 3631, and @SJ9 doubleton in E|pg||
nt|passell: yes exactly or both dia onside and east forgetting to cover the 9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: welcom -- sorry for the slightly late start|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|gulyas: cash 2 trumps, and cash all @Hs, ruffing 2 @Ds in hand|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You'll get more, don't worry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This was the last table up because the operator opened an invisible one by mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's why we don't have a result on board 1 entered|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and no names yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Susan will catch up, eventually, please be patient|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Sometimes best if no one knows your name|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@s will be no picnic for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now names|pg||
nt|bessi2: at least -3 it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Except Diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All good now, thanks Susan|pg||
nt|passell: with a club lead and dia return east has to find the heart shift|pg||
nt|roswolf: a filthy opening even 3rd in hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2/1 for N-S, Precision for E-W|pg||
nt|bessi2: good decision by Diamond to pass 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 13-15|pg||
nt|puncher99: choice of lebensol or neg x here|pg||
nt|taliga: NS overcall very agressively|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: more ketchup?|pg||
nt|puncher99: may be playing better minor lebensol|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: missing a pass operator|pg||

pc|h3|nt|frankaus: making |pg||

nt|ralfwil: killing lead|pg||
nt|karesz:  yes!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No never! 3@h for me|pg||
nt|taliga: so N decision of bidding 4@s immediately is a bit strange for me|pg||
nt|rodal f: Luckely no X.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfj: thx|pg||
nt|gulyas: weird lead|pg||
nt|passell: yes  very aggressive against this bidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like it.. his prospects with jx in @s aren't very exciting|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I would probably have lead a @c myself... a @h is out of the question in my view|pg||
nt|passell: I also like a club|pg||
nt|passell: diamond in a way makes the defense fool proof|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the throat|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 76 e/w in the other room bid and made 3nt for a 7 imp pickup|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: i fancy defence here|pg||
nt|puncher99: low diam off table south should play king|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry -- we had some difficulties setting up but should be good to go now -- welcome all|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi|pg||
nt|puncher99: south is wondering who has spade k|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with max 14 points on opener.....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: yes, cannot go wrong now|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 8 tricks here...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|puncher99: or how to untangle suit if pard has it|pg||
nt|bagman: S should play the Q in most cases (except when the lead is singleton)|pg||
nt|taliga: son only 200 :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|frankaus: very fine bid by Hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: about to have some with my dinner|pg||
nt|taliga: so|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||
nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||
nt|karesz:  wow!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gulyas: bd 16 they did pass 2@Hx, collecting the mentioned 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the @S may easily block but declarer runs out of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He just needs to see what developes after that|pg||
nt|puncher99: now is the key play|pg||
nt|bagman: N can duck also, I think, if S plays low|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a little help from my friends.....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|viren169: and probably a flat bd|pg||
pc|dA|nt|passell: the contract on the 1st hand was indeed 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 12 to Diamond, taking the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes playing on diamonds brings home the bacon|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|puncher99: its easier to cover the j then to play the king with low one led|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: N cashes the spade and switches according to S's suit preference|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|bagman: If heart, declarer wins that, plays the @DA and and later pushes the @CQ thru south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a series of avoidance type plays|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much for Diamond to play, but the cards are very friendly and he' s very likely to make the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very quiet bd in the other room|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen:  "Everything is working - running out of finesses"|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: When S starts thinking, Diamonds hopes get up|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he only needs the @DK to drop :) (so that he can get back to dummy to cash his namesakes)|pg||
nt|puncher99: hand much harder to  play if diam K was played at trk3|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H as a good raise or ask for @H hold a better bid. At least a stop in 3@S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|benjent: Faith in his partner - expecting a chunky hand at vul vs not|pg||
pc|cT|pg||

mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfs: 4414 or 54xx|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: well 4@h is even worse than 4@S..the bad part is that everything lies with West|pg||

nt|passell: yes  young and bold ones|pg||
nt|passell: or old and desperate ones|pg||
nt|bessi2: west's hand is pretty vulnerable.. I would simply raise to 4@h giving up on slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Tough position for NS in the auction, and they'll be worried about the double-game swing out|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead changes hands again|pg||
mb|p!|nt|passell: yes if you think what partner needs for slam|pg||

mb|d!|an|t/o|nt|sommer: friday night dinner with ketchup?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW got into the auction, but played their worst suit, going for 500 in 4@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11H IS CONTRO;S?OR A TRANSFER?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bagman: EW likely to end in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher99: shows spades|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that 1@H was positive balanced|pg||
nt|viren169: anothe dble by greco?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: iam told 8-11, no 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: a trump lead seems safe from west's point of view|pg||
nt|passell: yes when they had a make in 4clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 2n=leb or scramble I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Least dangerous perhaps - and I would rather underlead one of my aces than try a diamond|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d 7 is also a very normal lead imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Didn't find there best major but not unnatural endstation.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: looks like leb|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: normal contract|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now 10|pg||
nt|karesz:  weak two 2 @S it is funny for me |pg||
pc|d9|nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|benjent: killing the @h trick, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|benjent: In practice, Wolpert can now pick up the trumps, although he may not|pg||
nt|benjent: The cross-ruff is going to be a lot more appealing|pg||
nt|viren169: with 2@S likely to make another flatish bd|pg||
pc|d2|nt|taliga: Declarer can guess every card (after the bidding), and still it will not be enough|pg||
nt|taliga: 2 spades, 1 diamond, and a heart he sees going to the wrong way - at least|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: more than just merit even|pg||
pc|c4|nt|passell: the modern way of thing bidding diamonds over clubs at any level is conversion  not extra values|pg||
nt|roswolf: must lose the 2 black aces|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|karesz:  with this good hand and short @S|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: 4c was key card i think|pg||
nt|passell: maybe steaming a little after going for numbers on 1st 2 hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||

mb|p|nt|benjent: Well this is fun - the dealing machine is spitting out some nifty shapes!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||
nt|benjent: Several ways to approach the East hand. I like Hampson's choice (and I'm sure he'll be relieved to hear that :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D i expect from Hamson - traffic lights are green|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't - he's made his choice with 3@h. I expect he'll hope he's done the damage already|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|Vugraphzfj: 5+h's gf|pg||

nt|gulyas: I was trying to be nice:)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: bd 105 or 106?|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 105|pg||
nt|caitlin: 106|pg||
nt|taliga: an easy to bid 4@s with bad breaks in the main suits... |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might but imo should not|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart game more tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I prefer rdbl with north hand.. never learned to raise pd with only 2card support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on Hampson - once Wolpert moves over 3NT, the payoff structure changes a lot for Hampson. Now it's attractive to get his 2nd suit on the table ... and he did|pg||
nt|viren169: re|pg||
pc|d5|nt|passell: this is there way of showing the biggest 5 heart bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: W obv inviting slam with this sequence|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|bessi2: did that actually happen ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: x probably just showing minimum|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure east would have accepted with @dk instead of @c Q so this was a very good decision by diamond|pg||

nt|rodal f: 11 or 12 tricks? 11. Next|pg||
pc|h9|nt|caitlin: which one Jay?|pg||
nt|karesz:  1 @s balanced 8-12|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chessmaste: Well I don't think much of the second double, but E/W should emerge with a plus|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bagman: Now the @DA and a low back|pg||
nt|viren169: spade lead may defeat 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if duck first trick|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bessi2: I must confess that I would have blackwooded in a heartbeat|pg||
nt|passell: good 6nt on the bidding|pg||
nt|ybob: or second trick too|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: he can play low, he is in 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you paly that the cuebid promises 3 spades the west should bid 3@S over 3@H to suggest a poor quality @H suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: same auction in other room|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see two probable heart losers; he cannot afford not to finesse|pg||
nt|puncher99: 3n was cold|pg||
nt|jtmckee: so good result for n-s|pg||
nt|karesz:  3 @d show distribution 3-4-2-4|pg||

nt|bessi2: yes,  and in a spot where playing low was pretty standard|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|sK|nt|roswolf: sneaky|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|viren169: with the @cs breaking 3@D looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hT|nt|bessi2: I can't get over the bidding.. let alone west's second dbl which is bad imo, but east sitting in the dbl is beyond my understanding|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bagman: I think that the low heart was an illusory safety play|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|puncher99: run the spades now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: the contract is cold|pg||

mb|3N|nt|passell: maybe he will pass 4nt  very difficult|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: I like 4@h ... if Wolpert gets the message. His intention is clearly to say "excellent @c's, @h control, bit worried about them there @d's"|pg||
nt|passell: no more plus score available dont see a 10th trick in nt|pg||
nt|benjent: But without explicit suit agreement, this is the kind of auction that can descend into a series of cue-or-signoffs very quickly|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like the same 11 tricks as the OR|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if he play to 11, K@D @S to  k@S and low @C ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: 2@h will make easily enough|pg||

nt|roswolf: declarer is likely to come up short|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|benjent: The problem with 6NT is that you may actually be exposing the @dQ rather than protecting it. The red pre-empter could easily have @dK given your @h strength (and partner's @h ...|pg||
nt|benjent: stopper to boot)|pg||

nt|jtmckee: this one seems cold at first glance|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@C mixed raise in @Ds|pg||
nt|karesz:  relay|pg||
nt|karesz:  2 @d 4-crad @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW will probably bid 3nt on this board. A not so good 3nt as previous|pg||
nt|karesz:  and a 4-card minor|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: ah more understandable|pg||
nt|jtmckee: best lead|pg||
nt|caitlin: and ofte singleton trump not good lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: good point, that is my style too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So 3@H is stronger than 4 as 2@H was GF|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the defense can take 6 tricks: 3 hearts 2 diamonds and a club to beat |pg||
nt|caitlin: often|pg||
nt|jtmckee: will have to husband his entrys|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: this seems a fair slam|pg||
nt|puncher99: trump lead beats it 2 trks|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can only see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|taliga: S had his problem, because they overcall very agressively, so it was very probable from his point of view, that at these colours 5@d would be good|pg||
nt|taliga: I always lose a g. Aggressively. :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bagman: The heart slam requires the trumps to behave|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith actually held up 1 finger for 5@d, guess it's clear from the auction he doesn't have 4 keycards :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have thankfully missed the 4-4 @Cfit|pg||
nt|bagman: NT slam has extra chances in clubs|pg||
nt|sommer:  There's a short version here...maybe ...   http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=711&pid=278|pg||
nt|bagman: This requires the heart switch in trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may be difficult to find|pg||
nt|bagman: otherwise E might be able to discard a heart and ruff a heart in dummy|pg||
nt|karesz:  against @s lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bessi2: looks like -2|pg||
nt|jtmckee: a|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|frankaus: has a chance but need to get it all right|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Looks like a simple two down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks, coffee break:)|pg||
nt|passell: good 3nt by larsen   even if partner had 3 spades he might get beat in trumps  he has so much on the outside|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|caitlin: apparently 3@C mixed raise in @C and @Ds|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gulyas: I never see the point in leading a singleton in an unbid suit against notrump|pg||
nt|roswolf: not too much to the play|pg||
nt|sommer: this is a great contract|pg||
nt|bagman: The club slam is the worst requiring the clubs to be 3-2 with Q onside (or Q singleton)|pg||
nt|sommer: no..it's easy..and will be copied most places|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it needs trumps 3-2 which is not really great|pg||
nt|roswolf: acccurate wd|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|chessmaste: But declarer must attack the side suit first|pg||
nt|bessi2: if Deutch had opened 2@s, Diamond might overcall 2N which would not have been a pleasant contract to play|pg||
nt|gulyas: not that it matters here|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak's got a plausible X, but I think it has a bit to do with how his set is going as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: X ruff from here|pg||
nt|karesz:  he can win the third spade and will have 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: how?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@c 2@h 1@s and 3@d|pg||
nt|karesz:  N had to throw cards on diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sommer: this is around 55%|pg||
nt|taliga: d!6 was interpreted as suit preference... ?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chessmaste: Good play by declarer, avoiding 3 down|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this is going to get bloody|pg||
nt|taliga: @d6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bagman: N is now in position to cash 5 first and see what happens then|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chessmaste: Best to continue clubs|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chessmaste: Now he may well go 3 down|pg||
nt|benjent: Might need the @d finesse too|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jtmckee: down 2 it appears|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ybob: A@S and @H to 120|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: Once declarer sees the dummy he wishes he's in 6NT but no problem here as hearts behave|pg||
nt|sommer: 68% minus the very bad shapes is ok to me|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: really!?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He can throw 2@h (@hQ) if E plays 3 rounds of@d|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtmckee: down 3|pg||

pc|dK|nt|szalay: I know syl has a different opinion|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe he likes to score 90+100|pg||
nt|szalay: 1 of the reason: after 1@C-P-1@D they can overcall for a lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzfs: 2nt is 20-23|pg||
nt|syl: play strong 2!!! otherwise over (strong) 1@C they will overcall for the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  Mine is that one should use 1@c-1@d-1@h as a relay showing at least an extra K, so 1@c-1@d-1N is 17-19, and 1@c-1@d-1@h-1@s (0-4) - 1N is 20-22|pg||

mb|2N|nt|frankaus: re |pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bagman: Did S try the 13th heart to set up T9x of spades?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtmckee: dont think that happened in erd chair|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If he plays a small - either correct or doesn´t matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: could be trouble here...|pg||
nt|caitlin: Bathurst 275 Nickell 212|pg||
nt|jtmckee: wow what a pass by east|pg||
nt|karesz:  and now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I play notrump bids here showing @s raises with all suit bids natural after a strong club opening|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to make some good guesses in 3NT|pg||
nt|ybob: another 140 to E-W, now 2@C  p p 2@H ?|pg||
nt|karesz:  zoller tried double finesse in @d at board 4!|pg||
nt|karesz:  what about North"s step now?|pg||
nt|granguru: HI|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N could have had a better situation if he first had bid 2@c |pg||
nt|taliga: Declarer needed 1 black king at South, he had to decide which one|pg||
pc|dK|nt|taliga: 2N promises 20-22 here, but AK973 is +1 |pg||
nt|taliga: it is 20 anyway :) I miscounted :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bessi2: n-s not on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|ybob: or X from E|pg||
nt|viren169: or P P dble|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello John|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sommer: tough but makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D a lucky make|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to find the @CQ in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be routine , i think, but you never know|pg||
nt|karesz:  but then E culd not bid @h|pg||
nt|karesz:  could|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the layout is fairly kind to declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs 5 club tricks to pitch 2 hearts; he cannot make if W has Q9xx so should guess the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah now that makes it certain|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: easier now|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 3rd|pg||
nt|granguru: Well the double permited E to bid @H. that was the moment where NS got out of troubles (supposely)|pg||
nt|karesz:  can be this 4 @h natural?|pg||
nt|karesz:  can N believe it?|pg||
nt|granguru: what else?|pg||
nt|karesz:  cue with @c|pg||
nt|rodal f: So we say 21 for S:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: he will get the @h right, cannot lose to E twice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: knew that moved but wasnt sure about the river part|pg||
nt|sommer: @DQ 3rd or 4th makes it for Fred|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in N|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like declarer needs all the diamonds. He can get them but entries are short and this might require quite accurate play|pg||
nt|viren169: East taking the low road!|pg||
nt|viren169: North will hopeful respect the bidding...|pg||
nt|ybob: if S has 6@C and pd 4333 2@H was the good bid|pg||
nt|viren169: if South had an opening they would pass...|pg||
nt|ybob: not opening but 6@C decent|pg||
pc|c5|nt|passell: he should start hearts |pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that takes care of it|pg||
nt|benjent: Taken with the @c overcall, Greco will think that's a short @h lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Left to his own devices, he would like to work on the minors before drawing trumps, but that's not where he is|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping to put partner in for a heart thru|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: Now one more entry to dummy helps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman: "leads are?" Smith "4th best"|pg||
nt|karesz:  no, it was natural for Hegedus|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|granguru: well it is in fact a makeable contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: now he only needs 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|benjent: A mid-range alternative is to draw two rounds of trumps then try @d's|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|viren169: this wont be pretty...|pg||
nt|ybob: don´t like 2NT|pg||
nt|ybob: with xxx @S|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a pass to me...|pg||
nt|ybob: pd denies 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer runs the @DT|pg||
nt|taliga: no, because KQ is -1 for me :) :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|passell: oops |pg||
nt|gulyas: with 3221 for sure|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Greco will not assay the @D position after this lead|pg||
nt|passell: interesting not to lead a high club  worked well as declarer placed his partner with 1 of the top honors|pg||
nt|benjent: Drawing all the trumps then playing @d's is risky - if you get them wrong, they can play on @c's, force out West's last trump and be ready to pounce with a @d and @c trick later|pg||
nt|ybob: -100 instead  win 140|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|frankaus: wil lose just 2@D and @C|pg||
nt|benjent: Greco's still going to be in the position where he can't draw all the trumps ... so I reckon he will draw 2, and then play the @dK, hating it all the way|pg||
nt|sommer: no:)|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 light if North ducks 2 rounds of hearts...|pg||
nt|caitlin: Wolfson 200  Aker 180 or so-------Wolfson playing w Larry Cohen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with no entry on W - just give E 2 @h tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: can ruff low...to be overruffed means W has 9 @D, clearly not for  the bidding|pg||
nt|granguru: from* the bidding|pg||
nt|granguru: @HK|pg||
nt|karesz:  SSzabo had opened, so he has @cQ, no problem in the play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first @cA/K and then @hK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course @cA or @cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for a later finess ....|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bagman: A good try and a good bet S holding one spade and partner 5|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|bagman: Smith covered in the hope that Cohen had the 9|pg||
nt|roswolf: nae bother as a scottish friend of mine would say|pg||
nt|sommer: he will just take the @D's and play a small @H now|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bagman: Gitelman cannot be sure that the spades really are 4-2; the lead might have been false|pg||
nt|bagman: 4-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: not very likely though|pg||
nt|sommer: so?..does a @H finesse help then?|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart finesse does not help then, that's true|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is the 9th trick:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer was taking the club finesse to the safe hand protecting the @HK|pg||
nt|taliga: the excitement is about the number of the overtricks. Again. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|gulyas: @Ss will be cleared|pg||
nt|passell: he will now have to guess well|pg||
nt|gulyas: cash @DAK and then finesse in @Hs? has to give up a @H trick first|pg||
nt|passell: likely as long as he doesnt run clubs first|pg||
nt|karesz:  no finesse:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chessmaste: A strange misunderstanding|pg||
nt|viren169: @d now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sommer: so is the small:)..and no @C suit opened|pg||
nt|bagman: If spades are 5-2 and heart finesse works, declarer can afford to play @HQ|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jtmckee: east going to take the rest|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gulyas: if he does, he will see W started with 4-4 in the blacks|pg||
nt|caitlin: by East?|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 12 only|pg||
nt|jtmckee: has to take the d finess to make ten|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c7|nt|bagman: and if the @HK is with south with original 5 spades, the contract is going down anyway|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gulyas: making him less likely to hold @H length, hence getting the finesse right|pg||
nt|psyck: as Mike pointed out, starting on @h would have given him more chances, if he could knock out the entry to the long @s hand|pg||
nt|passell: 10 of clubs a misprint|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably played a low @C|pg||
nt|sommer: wow..they missed the "easy" slam in OR|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|nt|caitlin: Board 110 Gitelman bid/made 5@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: has he played?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no, is it still friday|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this hand had one intersting thing for sure|pg||
nt|jtmckee: he led low|pg||
nt|caitlin: Eric!!!!|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 4th best|pg||
nt|caitlin: has he played to dummy yet!!|pg||
nt|jtmckee: had he led 3rd  best and kept all his diamonds   declarer might play him for a dbltn rather than length|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no no no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: will be time problems if they don't move faster|pg||
nt|caitlin: true Jay|pg||
nt|ralfwil: crossruff:)|pg||

mb|6S|nt|benjent: Unfortunately, we got dropped out at an interesting point in the play on the last, but I assume Greco managed it smoothly|pg||
nt|sommer: + Q:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Lead problem|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 keycards, actually|pg||
nt|roswolf: well so i cant count or perhaps type:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: @CK creates a parking place for the diamond loser|pg||

mb|p|nt|taliga: weldone|pg||
nt|rodal f: Using 0314. I like better 1403|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bessi2: i wonder if Larsen will try to sneak a @h to the king right away|pg||
nt|bessi2: which would give him leeway to misguess @d|pg||
nt|bessi2: if it held that is|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: well perhaps e/w have dodged one|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|bagman: Did not GIB this but I think that @HK lead lets S to play a diamond trhu  in time|pg||

pc|s7|nt|chessmaste: These diaamonds are making like awkward for West, but he is discarding well so far|pg||

nt|karesz:  hi, father:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I play 2@s there pretty sound aswell but this east hand is too powerful for a 2@s bid there imo|pg||
nt|psyck: I may have tried a higher number of @h|pg||
nt|passell: the preemptive 1heart|pg||
nt|benjent: Indeed, don't make things worse. The wind will shift in their direction sometime. Need to make sure you haven't blown the match already when that happens.|pg||

nt|karesz:  it is the other 2 @d:):)|pg||

mb|2N|nt|bagman: Facing a passed partner and holding a bad hand with no source of tricks S goes for the offshape X instead of the dangerous 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|ybob: now better :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: a light opener in 1st seat|pg||
mb|3C!|an|forcing to 3!d|nt|roswolf: north sticks his neck out|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: The real score is probably 4-3 to Deutsch|pg||
nt|swanson: There is no really good opening bid with the South hand.  |pg||
nt|taliga: they have their own developed system...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT waited becauce the 5th@C|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|passell: very true   I prefer 1heart overcall to dbl with west  anyone have an opinion?|pg||
nt|benjent: 1@h for me too. Tell partner where you live|pg||
nt|bagman: S happy having avoided being dummy in 3@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now time to set up the 9th trick|pg||
nt|karesz:  sppade would be better, Wesz promised spades too|pg||
nt|karesz:  West |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: makes it very difficult for the opponents to get to 3nt  on many hands when it is cold|pg||
nt|sommer: calm down now...|pg||
nt|ybob: and light X too :)|pg||
nt|viren169: probably systematically t/out of @D|pg||

nt|caitlin: 21|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb.......|pg||
mb|3H|an|to play|mb|p|nt|bessi2: Larsen has to cash his 5 winners, otherwise he will wind up with only 4 it seems|pg||
nt|sommer: 9 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bagman: N cannot pass as 2@H is limited only by the inability to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chimera of the vul game bonus tempts north|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss asks Cohen if he had another way to raise 2@h to 3@h and Cohen says no|pg||
nt|bagman: N could have bid 2NT for the minors but 3@C is lead directing and normally also a good trump suit (facing a normal X=T/O)|pg||
nt|taliga: here we have the +1 point :)|pg||
nt|taliga: S tries to stop in 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: 9 tricks here ... but 6 losers first|pg||
nt|passell: 5 needed imps for deutsch|pg||
nt|passell: 7imps|pg||
nt|passell: hampson did have 1 suit stopped  just neither of theirs|pg||
nt|passell: Gavin did well to bid 1spade also|pg||
nt|benjent: I expect Kranyak will cash a big @d now|pg||
nt|sommer: sure sure..N has to raise to 3|pg||
nt|sommer: Cohen doesn't like it right now..I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed not clear how 3@S fares|pg||
nt|taliga: E can not tell how many... could have been 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: With clubs 4-1 he would need to find East with @D K10 doubleton|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|bagman: Everything else is friendly so S is unlikely to go down here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|benjent: Get some attitude (just in case) and also make sure partner returns the right thing|pg||
nt|passell: hampson hoping he has only 2|pg||
nt|ybob: S has 2 moves, @H or low @S ...|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ybob: now K @D and 8 @H  ...|pg||
nt|ybob: if duck N play @S ...|pg||
nt|taliga: Any idea for best line?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bessi2: 4@s make but may be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to guess the spades, avoid losing control and manage the diamonds (with ruff or luck)|pg||
nt|viren169: declarer will duck this expecting diamonds to be 5-3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|karesz:  and it could be enough|pg||
nt|taliga: 3? :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|viren169: and hope to bring the Ace down in 3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|viren169: easy for us to see... looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HK for me|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bagman: Deutch probably going plus in both rooms again|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks to be drifting -1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chessmaste: Now declarer thinks 'Might East have ducked with @DK7?' - Not a chance so he cashes out|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bagman: Taking the easy tricks for book|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is a bit unhappy but he really cannot go down on any sensible line he might take|pg||
nt|taliga: Actually I'd prefer bidding 3@h with 3 card supprort...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ybob: can´ t win if A @D on N |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|bagman: Diamond away|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|taliga: And in this case hard to find better than a @h lead.|pg||
nt|taliga: ruffing with the low trumps in hand?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ybob: to down 1|pg||
nt|karesz:  but West could not risk if East has @s:)|pg||
nt|taliga: Well.. x% we lose 6-6 spade fit. y% partner will go wrong in defence... which is bigger? x or y? :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can´t see what N is thinking about. If @sA is with E, he cannot make|pg||

nt|roswolf: but which slam?|pg||

nt|bagman: Might have some communication problems in NT with heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room e/w never got to grips with the hand|pg||

nt|roswolf: a relay sequence should do the trick here|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: a bidding challenge for n-s here.. to avoid the tempting 3N for the 11 trick gamecontract|pg||
nt|karesz:  1 @c Precision|pg||
nt|taliga: 1n is semiforcing|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chessmaste: 2@D looks like a limited 3 suiter|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  one of my two favorite opening bid conventions|pg||
nt|chessmaste: With N/S cold for 5@D this is not par so far|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is easy watching all 4 hands. but imo Larsen should protect here,  |pg||
nt|bessi2: could be disastrous, but you lose to many partscore swings by passing I think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps, and certainly if South is allowed to pass with this type of hand|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT was bad news for Hampson (wasted @d card in his partner's limited hand) and he's sensibly focussing on game|pg||
nt|bagman: But they have lots of cards and a reasonable diamond fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes fortune will favor the brave here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gulyas: 5@D the only making game|pg||

nt|bagman: Grand is possible but on a trump lead it might be a bit tricky to play|pg||

nt|jtmckee: and at Yankee stadium, mississippi state bulldog Jon Pappelbon takes the mound vs the evil empire|pg||

nt|sommer: ..and 7 it was|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK SOUTH JUST BID IT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen " I've got some holes" Smith: "you've got some too?"|pg||
nt|bagman: THis might take some time|pg||
nt|sommer: N has to take a few deep breaths...but the lucky lie of the cards may help him through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinks so too - he's gone for coffee :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well we can see both ordinary finesses work|pg||
nt|bagman: There are 11 tricks with one ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: remember..S has no entry after @Hfinesse!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i dont see how he can avoid taking at least 1|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might win this in dummy and then take the ordinary spade finesse and hope to ruff down the king|pg||
nt|sommer: .. he MUST run @S10 for sure|pg||
nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that looks the more practical line |pg||

nt|taliga: yes, always|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: tkx|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gowdy: :) thanks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|benjent: Greco could almost bid 1NT without looking at his hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Not much in play here; declarer loses two hearts and the spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen played very quickly from dummy and Moss said "too fast" - so Cohen waited a moment and then played and Moss said "still too fast" Cohen: "sorry"|pg||
nt|sommer: a practical 4@S from N..and he's awarded with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sommer: quite lucky, but ok|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much N can do; he either makes this or not (losing to 4-1 spades or uppercut/overruf)|pg||
nt|sommer: it's only around 33% but 4@S is "the bid"|pg||
nt|bagman: If E cashes a heart and plays a club; N might wonder weather to play @SK from hand or go to dummy and play a spade to pick up A singleton onside and risk diamond ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman took the @h A out, but now has folded his hand up again|pg||
nt|bagman: 1@H looks like no 5M, no 6m with positive values|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: as before|pg||
nt|jtmckee: and the Mississippi State Bulldog shuts down the bronk bombers|pg||
nt|taliga: The weak no trump makes life hard for both pair here|pg||
nt|taliga: E couldnt introduce majors, |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bessi2: hmm.. had to cancel my speech regarding the play in 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: can't read the notes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a wild guess. Easier if S had a natural @c opening|pg||
nt|taliga: N couldn't bid his hand or ask anything from partner|pg||
nt|karesz:  Hegedus as brave poiceman!|pg||
nt|taliga: After a bid like this, you lead like after gambling 3N: your ace |pg||
nt|taliga: this case... it was not very succesfull...|pg||
nt|taliga: only club would have been good|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|benjent: Double seems a bit optimistic with no @c pips|pg||
nt|gowdy: and the world is good !|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chessmaste: Well, South pushed the boat out with 2@H and has now left his ship in the harbour. 4@H would have had chances - this has none |pg||
nt|gulyas: this will not test declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: a trump lead would have prolonged the play|pg||
nt|sommer: @H for @C's?|pg||
nt|viren169: West didnt raise because East is limited|pg||
nt|viren169: 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|benjent: The 2nd @c trick gets Greco up to 6, and the @s finesse will make it 7|pg||
nt|benjent: No problem getting the @d suit right when North has bid both blacks|pg||
nt|jtmckee: yes it is|pg||
pc|c3|nt|passell: looks like he will make this|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond play is not that risky as if there was a diamond ruff hangin, the defense might have gone for that|pg||
nt|sommer: @H2..|pg||
nt|roswolf: creaking to the obvious contract|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bagman: This is the best lead and declarer might have some difficulties as he's probably giving up a club |pg||
nt|bagman: then a diamond back and defense set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: win and lead a heart following with the club finesse looks very natural|pg||
nt|gowdy: note the lead @H 2  so S thinks  they are 44 or W has the length|pg||
nt|jtmckee: yes  he will knock out the wrong entry first and regret it later|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite @C to the A  then a @D hook|pg||
nt|karesz:  13 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bessi2: imo,  both are to blame for this contract|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: A low diamond now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|taliga: double dummy analysis, as always... |pg||

nt|ralfwil: and I had also preferred to show both majors as E|pg||

nt|roswolf: re|pg||
nt|sommer: The Italian waiter struck again!!|pg||
nt|bagman: The club ruff was too early as S can discard a diamond on the next club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sorry, slightly flakey internet connection too - you'd think with 4 choices I could find one that was solid :)|pg||
nt|sommer: right..thats why it's -2 now|pg||
nt|sommer: you havent been a waiter in Italy, do you, Susan?:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N needs to take this and play a club for a diamond discard; if W wins this, he should take his two diamond tricks as long as he can|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Actually, this is Jan - I switched with Susan when we couldn't get Susan's computer on the internet; haven't been a waiter any place|pg||
nt|roswolf: natural to win i think|pg||
nt|sommer: ok:)|pg||
nt|bagman: S can hold @SK and QJT98 of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: We're at trick 5 now - did something not get through (still worrying about connection :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room the grand is being played in 4@H!!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: FROZEN AT TRICK 3|pg||
nt|sommer: "The Italian waiter" is a BBO "thing"...from a vue-graff in Italy some years ago, where a waiter fell over the pc cables and turned all off |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss deciding whether to take the diamond finesse - if he hadn't been doubled, of course he'd need it for 4 (losing 2 hearts and a spade) but doubled, he knows hearts aren't ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: breaking|pg||
nt|bagman: Diamond lucky in the grand hand because 4@H does not lose much more than 6@D would lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: jan what happened at t3 did north win @SA?|pg||
nt|bagman: That also shows why on IMPs dubious grands should not be bid; the opps might end up in game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I'll keep playing out the hand and then if it doesn't get through to you, I'll have to close and start again and hope I can do better. But spade to A, Club Q on which S pitched a ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamond & W ruffed, diamond J winning, |pg||
nt|roswolf: TY JAN|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: calm waters|pg||

pc|hA|nt|gulyas: good play, cashing the @CAK would have let it thru|pg||
nt|gowdy: GIb might find it  :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the @S9 stops the spades and declarer holds enough tricks to make the contract|pg||
nt|bagman: Is he going to play a diamond up for an overtrick?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he probably should|pg||
nt|rodal f: The long @C came as an exsta premium anyway:)|pg||
nt|taliga: at least 4 :)|pg||
nt|taliga: (if not strong balanced)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not best minor?|pg||
nt|taliga: Better minor, yes. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Could then have 4-3-3-3 or?|pg||

nt|bagman: after the opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: north thinking of a puntot 3nt?|pg||
nt|roswolf: punt at|pg||
nt|bagman: N reluctant to bid that as the sequence marks W with club length|pg||
nt|puncher99: doesnt look like ns pair is on same page|pg||
nt|roswolf: not unreasonable|pg||
nt|bagman: With 3163 he would have bid it already :)|pg||
nt|karesz:  after 5@c 6@c of course :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 2@S 4@S surely|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chessmaste: North has a weak two in diamonds - great thinks South - but it could have been worse - he might have opened 3@D |pg||
nt|bessi2: I think Deutsch had better left this one alone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: It was -2|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok thx|pg||
nt|roswolf: now may play 4@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi folks|pg||
nt|ybob: Hello :)|pg||
nt|jtmckee: closest thing to a good result poor ole N-S have had in a while|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: South's bidding is wildly optimistic|pg||
nt|taliga: 2@d was GF|pg||
nt|taliga: nat|pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice comming 3NT? U can't beat it.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfj: At least that's what was claimed and I double checked - declarer pitched a spade on the diamond A as S ruffed|pg||
nt|karesz:  ! @d from S instead?|pg||
nt|karesz:  4 @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: ruffed a spade to get to dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hope we're okay now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: N failed to cover the @DJ so there was a diamond winner to take care of the spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL DONE OR PLAYING IN LUCK!?|pg||
nt|bagman: S willing to try 3NT with diamond filler and solid club stopper|pg||
nt|roswolf: well not many overtricks|pg||
nt|ybob: trump lead ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: close one........here and at other tables|pg||
nt|karesz:  carefull players on both side|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: I will say it one more time - a void in partner's suit is not an asset |pg||
nt|bessi2: e-w let him off the hook which is surprising... west has an easy penalty dbl there imo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 1 heart =8-11 artificial -5 sp|pg||
pc|sT|nt|taliga: for ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chessmaste: Agreed - the bridge has been moderate so far|pg||
nt|roswolf: chicken|pg||
pc|sA|nt|benjent: Can nearly make this now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: once more a fatuous overcall attracts a poor lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: south i think showed a clear lack of bottle|pg||
nt|rodal f: Beleive so:)|pg||
nt|taliga: :)|pg||
nt|taliga: 11, go on |pg||
mc|10|nt|benjent: Without the @c lead, declarer has to fall back on the @d finesse when @c's don't break. With this lead, he can actually pick up the @c's|pg||

nt|roswolf: with one of my pards an overcall opposite a passed pard ALWAYS promised a good wuality suit - great for mps!|pg||
nt|roswolf: quality|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss asked who had the @d K|pg||
nt|jtmckee: congrats to the Diamond team|pg||
nt|taliga: you have @sK at E|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: was a claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@s and 1@c for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|benjent: Flat board, but there was more on the line here than at the other table. I like Diamond's minus better than Deutsch's.|pg||
nt|taliga: 11-14 again|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: EW play precision, but their 1NT is a little stronger than usual - 14-16|pg||
nt|ybob: problems to N-S|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: softly softly e/w|pg||
nt|bagman: Even the overcall loses a trick from time to time it's still probably winning bridge to overcall aggressively with dubious suits|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@C = @C + other ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: can't read notes|pg||
nt|taliga: What do you think, how many major suit W has? 1 or 2?|pg||
nt|karesz:  2 @c capelleti (onesuiter) i think|pg||
nt|taliga: ok, but how would you evaluate the hand?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|caitlin: if DONT runouts|pg||
nt|ybob: Dont style|pg||
nt|ybob: DONT style|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Sometimes KQ bare is not as good support as xxxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt ps tempting|pg||
nt|bagman: Here W hopes for 3NT where high diamonds help|pg||
nt|roswolf: is|pg||
nt|bagman: E, on the other hand, might think that 5 @D might be good|pg||
nt|roswolf: a fine contract|pg||
nt|taliga: 1n 12-16|pg||
mb|2N|nt|benjent: Excuse me, 1NT is 15-17 in 3rd/4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: not sure I would have protected there but I like it nonetheless|pg||
nt|roswolf: temporising|pg||
nt|bagman: Making a probe|pg||
nt|ybob: XX shows 2 places out ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: N bids 2@H now it will be doubled|pg||
nt|ybob: if XX shiows 2 places why not bid 2@D from N ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks a simple make|pg||
nt|ybob: clear 4144 by S|pg||
nt|caitlin: as long as Hampson doesn't bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ???|pg||
nt|ybob: not a bad spot 2@H win 6/7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: pretty good 6@c contract here but seems doomed to fail as the cards lie|pg||
nt|benjent: Even so, that's a keen 3NT not vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass the buck bid|pg||
nt|taliga: optimistic 2n bid|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: well this is rightsided|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nickell 236  Bathurst 277|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: is that final?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: and gains the 8th trick|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..and will probably make!|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9th|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen asks for a review of the auction|pg||
nt|sommer: with @DJ falling thats 9|pg||
nt|bagman: S did not X 3@S because he expected a spade lead on the auction|pg||
nt|caitlin: no Lebensohl so DONT but Gavin must think 2@H better than 2@D???|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D was better|pg||
nt|caitlin: noooooo|pg||
nt|caitlin: Wolfson 212 Acker 192 not final|pg||
nt|gowdy: My dogs are telling me they want to walk ,,,, see you all tomorrow  ( if it rains)  no golf|pg||
nt|caitlin: open room on bd 114|pg||
nt|jtmckee: good nite|pg||
nt|caitlin: night:) ty|pg||
nt|karesz:  i do not understand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|benjent: Is it playable? Sure, but he'll need to pull off some magic in the @c suit|pg||
nt|benjent: Curiously, Hampson probably had to unblock the @s's at trick to be able to make on the layout (so that he could force a 2nd entry to table)|pg||
nt|benjent: at trick 1, that is|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the defense has 7 tricks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@c was majors i think|pg||
nt|karesz:  Why did not West bid 3 spdes? Why bid East 3 spades?|pg||
nt|karesz:  so why did east bid 2 @d instead 2 @s?|pg||
nt|karesz:  of|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bessi2: tricky hand to defend.. I predict 110|pg||
nt|bessi2: it actually seems that this contract is unbeatable|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bagman: and often it's a bad idea to X probes giving away bidding space|pg||
nt|roswolf: but of course the defence can cash out but i have my doubts|pg||
nt|bagman: or 8|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H X is the second best contract|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|jtmckee: hello ira|pg||
nt|caitlin: Welcome Ira|pg||
pc|hA|nt|benjent: I reckon Hampson now expects the @cK to be with North ... South has shown a lot of cards|pg||
nt|caitlin: so at other table 2@H E-W and here N-S!!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|benjent: But with only only clear entry to the board, he's playing for @cJ to be with South|pg||
nt|roswolf: serves him right - always make things easy for your ox opposite!|pg||
nt|ybob: better 2@D i think|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|bagman: There's not much left for Moss to try: he needs now diamonds running |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinking, we didn't lose connection again :)|pg||
nt|sommer: the @Cplay was an extra chance to the @D's ..hoping @C are 3-3, if @D dont work|pg||
nt|roswolf: no time pressure is there?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen: "sorry" - he's been moving the spade 2, spade 7 and club 10 into playing position |pg||
nt|bagman: This is KO and they are two boards ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Of course they don't know about the other table, but I'm pretty sure there isn't any time problem (each table is screened off so we can't see the clocks in the middle of the room ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: but could move the curtains aside and look if wanted to|pg||
nt|roswolf: best chance for south is to switch to@S isnt it?|pg||
nt|bagman: DD, yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Director just announced 20 minutes, so definitely no time problems|pg||
nt|bagman: But S might think that W holds the Q and N better hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: He probably shoots back a low club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Wonder if S can tell that the @h Q at trick 1 was a falsecard (in the sense that he must have had either ten or nine) so know that W didn't want a shift?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen has now moved a diamond to the end of his hand - considering going passive?|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point but i cnat see how a club or a diamond could lead to 4 more reicks for defence|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: almost played the @s 7|pg||
nt|roswolf: tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He might hope for 8 or less for declarer instead of getting 5 or more for the defense :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is likely that diamonds are favorable for declarer so he must generate tricks elsewhere|pg||
nt|caitlin: next last board here.....open much slower|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: how could anyone be slower:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Bathurst has defeated Nickell|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: congrats to Bathhurst|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: perhaps i dont now|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|benjent: Good @h return - I reckon that was tough after the @s lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's been playing along quite nicely in this set|pg||
nt|benjent: This is probably going to sail 2 or 3 off now|pg||
nt|caitlin: still @H ruff in 2@D|pg||
pc|s9|nt|benjent: Kranyak should clear the @h's, Hampson will take the @c finesse as his best shot at 9 tricks, and the roof will cave in shortly afterwards|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i can see the cards south cant - which is why it would be fascinating to hear his thoughts|pg||
nt|ybob: the best was 1@H but this made W :)|pg||
nt|taliga: it seems, that the other room is 7(!) boards behind us|pg||
nt|taliga: oh, finished another, only 6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|taliga: the bid seems more reasonable if W showed 6 cards of @ss :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|bagman: EW could have taken the same 8 tricks in spades for 110 instead of 100 in this contract|pg||
nt|caitlin: won't make yet again|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|bagman: Now Moss takes his only chance for the contract|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||

nt|ybob: if W denies it|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|caitlin: hard slam to bid without knowing partner's exact shape|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|swanson: The Larry Cohen version of Jacoby as published in Bulletin last year is 3@C all minimums.  Probably in use by E-W.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|benjent: Thanks to my fellow commentators Mike Passell and Frank Budai, and our operator Susan|pg||
nt|bagman: Win this and take winners for double squeeze|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: Agressive bridge leads often to huge IMP turnover|pg||

nt|benjent: Results at http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8|pg||
nt|petergill: The play of 4@HXX on a @D lead would be interesting. Academic point, perhaps. |pg||
pc|sT|nt|bagman: the rest plays itself automatically for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all|pg||
nt|bagman: thx all, bye for now|pg||
nt|caitlin: push|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty all:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: more to come any minute|pg||
nt|ybob: E could be push another, good cards |pg||
nt|petergill: Playing Precision with light openings, West was worried that partner had Q109xx, Axxxx, KQx void, and the Dbl meant a heart ruff awaited 5@S|pg||
nt|ybob: to me W bid well|pg||
nt|ybob: but not sure if E did|pg||
nt|ybob: 2NT = 4 cards supp , 3NT = serious, 4@H = cue over 4@C shows void ... |pg||
nt|ybob: he needs make a waiting bid 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Would been nice but always 9 tricks. Now 10 as in 4@S|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bessi2: it was difficult for Larsen to resist the temptation for the ruff there|pg||
nt|bessi2: nearly impossible|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|benjent: Assigning the blame for this, I'd say majority North. 3@h is just too pushy after a plain 2@s raise|pg||
nt|benjent: The @d's finesse was desperate, and has cost him an extra undertrick|pg||

nt|csabi: Minarik should have opened instead :)|pg||
nt|granguru: but cant do nothing about it...thinking on 3NT but the 1@D bid suggests @D will not be 4-4|pg||
nt|csabi: but that would not have helped either :)|pg||
nt|granguru: in fact, 3N -2|pg||
