nt|fabsayc: 3s-5s-6s is possible although i doubt it will happen|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that would get a club lead I'm sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends on their structure over 2nt rebid|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|othered1: 7:46 here, in the midst of a power failure that will likely tax my back-up|pg||
nt|benjent:  East is on lead to 6@s ... East may not be enthusiastic about leading a @d, depending on the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually a diamond is right no matter how auction goes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|benjent:  not that this will happen, but if Lee cues @d's and bypasses @c's ... would you still lead a @d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would peek around the partition at Linda's face|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|benjent:  heh :)|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 3NT might have been a 'serious' slam try in spades|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think it's very hard to lead a diamond from the East hand|pg||
nt|othered1: That would make going past 3n mandatory without support?|pg||
nt|benjent:  oh no, it's reasonable enough. You need 2 tricks to shoot slam. @hA is one, and the least you need from partner for the other is @dK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 granville island beers says sandra leads a diamond|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: If she's on lead . . . |pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Each of those minor doubletons a full point downgrade to start.  Has to be a @C here from N.  Gentle raise here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: mmm... full 14 with good trumpos and 2 aces -- she must really hate 4333 hands|pg||

nt|pamela: congratualtions to Eaton team   great result for them  and I am sure they will  do us proud in Netherlands   ( and  via mexico if there is a play off  first)|pg||

nt|buffytvs: hope you've all enjoiyed the broadcast -- thx to BBO and our operator, and my fellow commentators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what happened|pg||
nt|buffytvs: she made it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was the only legitimate chance assuming defense correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|buffytvs: dbl = 1-suiter presumably|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but if east blanked heart ace and keep a club you have to duck diamond and lead a heart|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|buffytvs: might make 5@C here they bid it NS|pg||
nt|jcwla: Quiet end in CR.  Slam on a @S hook and no @D problem.|pg||
nt|pamela: pass  from Linda is a force to 2NT if they play same system |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: and odd contract that will work out quite well|pg||

nt|pamela: last two board fine for cimon team   but they have left their run too late but deficit not as huge now|pg||
