nt|daman: EW could push them around with their @s suit|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|daman: with all of the breaks NS couls make slam if they wished|pg||
nt|athene: 4@SX would be be interesting - i think on best defence it's 5 down?|pg||
nt|daman: but that would be double dummy|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: ah, no, perhaps only 4 down|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|daman: 3@S = shortness|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|daman: 3NT will put a damperon things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is misguided if natural|pg||
nt|athene: the strength of 2@H is really ambiguous |pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: if north thinks it's at all a good hand she will surely drive to slam|pg||
nt|athene: with a sixth heart and a club fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Francine will keep trying|pg||
nt|athene: probably you push even if 2@H might be a minimum game-force|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|daman: and Linda cooperates with 4@D|pg||
nt|mcbear: closed room still not working|pg||
nt|Walddk2: soon I am told|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: would 3@S connote a 6 card @H suit?      how wouldthe auction go with 1543?|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C over 2@H?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|fabsayc: good point, maybe it should|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i'm not sure about this auction and i am not sure NS are sure, either :)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt can't really be to play, facing a spade splinter?|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe it's just non-serious|pg||
nt|daman: looks like they will get there...kicking and screaming|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT should show @S values|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another bad case for 1430|pg||
nt|athene: well, now south can't ask for the @HQ, so they might get there seredipitously|pg||
nt|athene: sereNdipitously|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Did Cimon ever show the 6th heart? That's what makes 6 a decent contract|pg||
nt|daman: Bill     please try not to use words with more than 2 syllables      it gives me a headache|pg||
nt|athene: :) ok,especially if i miss random letters out of them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, that is excruciatingly rude, I agree, George :)|pg||
nt|athene: it was inconsiderate, indeed|pg||
nt|daman: all those big words    like chalk scratching on a blackboard|pg||
nt|daman: we can now rewind to my first comment    they can make slam if they can get there|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the odds of picking up this trump suit are about 50%, more or less - you cash one honour and then play restricted choice if appropriate?|pg||
nt|athene: so you lose against some @HQJ doubletons|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not that simple, Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because you don't know which honour to cash|pg||
nt|athene: but you gain against some singleton honours|pg||
nt|fabsayc: exactly may try to establish clubs|pg||
nt|athene: well, sure, but also it is not just a matter of picking up the trumps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: you have the fourth diamond to deal with|pg||
nt|athene: (and the third sorry)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: this is the website for the Canadian Championships     http://cbf.ca/BWeek/11files/|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|janm: And it's not clear that you can play for 3-1 trumps anyway, is it - need to get 12 tricks and the simplest way to do that (not any more) was to ruff diamonds in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|janm: May still be right to play to ruff diamonds - East would probably have led spade A from AK as well as just A|pg||
nt|athene: trying to ruff two diamonds in dummy carries additional risks|pg||
nt|athene: like west overruffing|pg||
nt|athene: so i am not sure this is a 50% slam or even near it|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, this isn't just a "pick up trumps and you're home" slam|pg||
nt|daman: not as bad as a Roland slam though|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: Roland would love to be in this one|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: No, too good for me|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: some pairs play they always lead K from AK against slams|pg||
nt|athene: asking for count to see if the ace stands up|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|janm: Most play that you shouldn't have agreements like that against slams, because it helps declarer more than partner|pg||
nt|janm: Especially when declarer has shown a splinter as here|pg||
nt|athene: i think that style was part of the Vinje thing - you lead ace against a slam asking partner "have you got the king?" and you lead king to ask "will my ace stand up?"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: Francine is a very deliberate declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Cumpstone must hope that declarer only has five trumps, say KJ10xx|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: No luck|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of specs have suggested figures of about 35% for the slam - maybe that's a bit low but not much|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|h5|nt|daman: she will now be forced to finesses the @D or play for the @S King with West|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s7|pc|h6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|athene: you would like to ruff a diamond to see if the queen drops before falling back on the ruffing spade finesse|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: but you can't do that of course|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrrmmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: as you need both entries (@DK, @D ruff)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks very wrong line|pg||
nt|daman: very|pg||
nt|daman: down now|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: maybe she felt abashed about being in a sub-50% slam|pg||
pg||
qx|o6|st||md|4SJT5H943D943CAJ64,SAK9843HAK2DAQCT7,SQ762HT85D76CQ532,SHQJ76DKJT852CK98|sv|e|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@D is an excellent contract played by East|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Might be difficult to bid|pg||
nt|athene: west will surely drive this to slam if she finds about the sixth diamond|pg||
nt|athene: she might just be worried about 1-4-5-3 or something|pg||
nt|janm: East certainly won't cooperate, with a minimum hand and a void in partner's suit|pg||
nt|daman: 6@H by East would be better at Matchpoints|pg||
nt|janm: There's the 6th diamond for West - let's see if you're right that she'll drive to slam|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: i don't see how you can stop out of slam with west if you find pd has a club control and something resembling a diamond suit - you can pretty much count it home, ruffing the spades ...|pg||
nt|athene: good|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if necessary|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: You mean 6NT, George, to get all the matchpoints|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|athene: now west is worried her partner hasn't got the sixth diamond, i suspect|pg||
nt|athene: unless they have a really firm agreement 2@D promises 6|pg||
nt|daman: 6NT by east makes also|pg||
nt|daman: i agree|pg||
nt|athene: even so, you can't really not play that hand in slam can you|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west will go for the Moysian|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 1453 should rebid 1NT, to me this is 46 but does not solve the club control issue|pg||
nt|athene: well i think you just play pd for a club control|pg||
nt|athene: because she opened the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: i mean if you can find out, fine, but if you can't, you assume she has it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you east does not have semblance of an opener without a club control|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise you miss slam too much|pg||
nt|athene: yes exactly|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but 4@S does not sound forcing to me|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggsests that west is just wondering about 7 vs 6 but 4@S looks awfully passable if so|pg||
nt|athene: i mean have YOU, dear spectator, discussed this auction with your favourite partner recently?|pg||
nt|daman: Moysian Fit: A contract in which the declarerÂ’s trump suit is divided 4-3. It is named for Mr. Alphonse Moyse Jr. and who fervently advocated this distribution as part of his case ...|pg||
nt|daman: in favor of opening 4-card majors and raising with three trumps.     |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i wonder if 6@D at this stage is even natural|pg||
nt|janm: Neither player seems to be thinking of diamonds as trump, do they?|pg||
nt|athene: i thought a random jump to 5nt pick-a-slam might be on the horizon|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 5nt would certainly help|pg||
nt|athene: west doesn't seem to entertain the possibility of playing in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not so good this|pg||
nt|janm: Oops, wrong sided. And clubs feels like the natural suit to lead|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have pinpointed the lead also|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes the advantage of playign in diamonds is that partner, with @DK109xxx, gets to play a trump coup and earn bouquets, applause, etc|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: they just snatched defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
nt|athene: another advantage is you protect the @CK|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests a strong jump shift would work well|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|nt|athene: it might do|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: maybe  go  back to sayc :)|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure it would solve all problems though |pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: the main problem was that confusion set in with the "expert" 2@H on a fragment|pg||
pg||
qx|o7|st||md|1SQ86HQ654DT853CQT,SAK4H873DAJ9C7642,S72HKDK7642CAJ983,SJT953HAJT92DQCK5|sv|b|nt|athene: east then wanted to play in hearts but west was, understandably, reluctant|pg||
nt|janm: The main problem was that West wasn't thinking about playing in diamonds. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: you just have to have more agreements than EW had|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h is essentially new suit forcing, but maybe it should always promise 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: many good pairs play semi-artificial 1@D 1@S 2@D 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: "third suit forcing"|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not enough just to make the bid to set up a force|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, that's the advantage of making a strong jump shift - subsequent bids are forcing so you can bid naturally from then on|pg||
nt|athene: you actually need to discuss subsequent auctions|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: yes, the strong jump shift might be useful in that regard|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: here we go with another problem shape|pg||
nt|athene: hmm|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: what's happening here|pg||
nt|janm: I guess 2@d was forcing Stayman, which many pairs like to play over weak NT. No idea what 3@c is though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: is 2@D game-forcing stayman?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: so 2nt says no 4major or 5minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this 2@D forcing stayman and sharples convention|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C asks and now 3nt is 3-3-3-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Well, I guess they knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|athene: (3@D = 3-3-4-3, 3major = (32) 44)|pg||
nt|janm: even if we didn't :)|pg||
nt|athene: well that is one way to play anyway, that was the scheme in original precision club|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: why anyone would play 2-way stayman is beyond me but that's another matter - i know some good players like it with weak notrumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 way stayman is still very popular in Ontario|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: i know Kokish is (was) a big fan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: main advantage is for minor suit slams with two balanced hands|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: I don't understand why so many like it and I'm a weak NT'er - I think you can handle more hands with trnansfers|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: if any spectators are wondering what we are all babbling about|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: "two way stayman" means 2@C is stayman but not game-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is stayman but game-forcing|pg||
nt|janm: Those two balanced hand minor suit slams just don't seem to come up very often, though|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|d2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: 2major are weak takeouts, which are what people were forced to use in the bad old days before electricity and transfers and indoor plumbing|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: and even before alerts|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|athene: there are other ways to deal with the slammy balanced hands - you can play CONFIT and stuff if you really care|pg||
nt|janm: And we're talking about it because this isn't a very interesting hand when you can see all 4 hands, although it was not clear how to play it when you couldn't, so declarer hasn't ...|pg||
nt|janm: just claimed - but she didn't know that the @s Q and @c A were onside and is playing to make even if they're wrong|pg||
nt|daman: she needs to play a @D now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||

mb|r|nt|janm: East has to decide whether to run from this and if so how - I think I'd just pass planning to play 1NT dbld as the least of evils, but apparently she can't do that - don't know ...|pg||
nt|janm: what the follow ups will be when West RDBLs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like to play pass of penalty double is willing to play there|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it gives you more sequences, but the BIG disadvantage is that you can't play in 1nt doubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: if you think 1nt will make you usually get a good board just from 1nt X all pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: run out starts with stayman|pg||
nt|janm: And this is a good example of a hand where 1N dbld is probably our best spot :)|pg||
nt|athene: making or plus one|pg||
nt|athene: if you redouble you force opps to run away|pg||
nt|daman: there are those who play Brozel rescues   Landy rescues etc |pg||
nt|athene: they never sit it unless you are going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: also, if 1nt is going down, it might still be your best spot|pg||
nt|athene: not redoubled though|pg||
mb|2H|nt|janm: Probably 2@c here shows clubs and a higher suit (and an immediate suit bid would have shown a 1-suiter). |pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though 2@C was clubs and a major|pg||
nt|athene: and 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|janm: Or maybe not, since I'd have expected West to pass if 2@c showed clubs and a higher|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: there are many ways to play - you have lots of ways to wriggle|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: double is greedy|pg||
nt|athene: for example the immediate redouble might be a 5-card suit and immediate 2@C@D@H might be lower of touching 4-carders|pg||
nt|athene: so force the redouble then run to 2 of a suit shows non-touching|pg||
nt|athene: that's why east can bid 2@H as she knows her partner has a major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: now north is a bit stuck if she thinks she is in a force|pg||
nt|athene: a far better way to play in these situations is that after you double 1nt, your side gets one more takeout double|pg||
nt|athene: either player can make it|pg||
nt|athene: after that it's all penalties|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so with that scheme north would pass 2@H and they might or might not double 2@S - but it would be takeout|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north thinks that south not running has promised values|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|janm: What you do after you DBL a weak NT is one of the things we all need to discuss carefully - it's important for the DBL'er to be able to find out whether partner has any values, and ...|pg||
nt|janm: of course the DBL is also very wide-ranging. |pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: and the other important issue is that these auctions come up a lot|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Will Eaton find the brilliant sourrounding play in clubs?|pg||

nt|janm: Yes, that's true - although I avoid them by not playing penalty DBLs of weak NT's in one partnership :) (unless the NT is 10-12)|pg||
nt|athene: the advantage of playing double as takeout is it fits well with pass being non forcing or forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CJ isb he card|pg||
nt|athene: and even if you have a misunderstanding whether pass is forcing, you still don't have a huge disaster, usually|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Devastating|pg||
nt|athene: there is a school of thought which says you should tend to lead the "other minor" on these auctions, rather than the unbid major|pg||
nt|athene: the point being that opener frequently has the other major |pg||
nt|athene: and less often the other minor|pg||
nt|daman: this lead will be in tomorrow's Bulletin|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Sadly you don't have that tool at the table|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 4nt probably intended as invite|pg||
nt|athene: south doesn't know if this is natural or blackwood but she will certainly force to slam anyway|pg||
mb|6C|nt|athene: she has fifteen control cards|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she is trying to cater for it being both minors as well|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this is a really bad slam|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that south might have been better to try 5nt as "pick a slam"|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: 6@C might be taken as natural - say 4 spades 5 clubs if 3@S only promised 4|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought the club lead was fairly marked |pg||
nt|athene: but maybe west is worried about her opps having trick sources in the black suits|pg||
