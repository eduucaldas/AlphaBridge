nt|andyv:  good 6@s slam and shouldn't be too difficult to get there|pg||
nt|gulyas: optimists can find this slam|pg||
nt|gulyas: not easy to get E to cooperate|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  open W with 2@c and you will get there|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@D-4@S and then?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you should get there this way too...but will be wrong sided and a low @c could cause E to lose some sleep|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d exculsion would be good here|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats a kind of 3 loser hand where pd can bring a few more losers:)|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@d probably shortness|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: splinter, yes|pg||

nt|gulyas: @H void may be useless|pg||
nt|gulyas: you need the majors to behave|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is...now W would really need a leap in faith to go on|pg||
mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|gulyas: strong @C action did not help them get to slam in CR, lets see here|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should show a void and E still has a problem...mainly @c suit|pg||

pc|s9|nt|gulyas: you need extra optimism from W, or some extra cooperation from E to get to slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think W should have bid the slam since it's probably going to be based on either th A@c being on side or pd having some @c cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, at worst...probably around a 55% slam|pg||
