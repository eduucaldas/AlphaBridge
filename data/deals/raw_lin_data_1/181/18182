nt|Walddk2: she has opened the wrong broadcast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Joyce?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please shut down and open an  O  broadcast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have created a  B|pg||
nt|daman: I think Maurice is in this room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's JOyce according to profile|pg||
nt|daman: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Joyce?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Read on your screen please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the wrong setup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The closed room operator can't connect to a  B  broadcast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please shut down and open an  O|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't do more, sorry|pg||
nt|daman: 306-586-3443 is the number of the hotel |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone in the audience at the venue?|pg||
nt|daman: don't see anyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe you could call, George?|pg||
nt|daman: I'll try|pg||
nt|daman: we have someone trying to get into the closed room as we speak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have a problem if our operator does not read what I write|pg||
nt|daman: they are trying the several rooms being used|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is dead easy to correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it requires than someone 'listens'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sometimes I wish I had a remote control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We could try to boot her, of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that does not guarantee that she will open the correct broadcast when she comes back|pg||
nt|daman: I even tried an operator's cell phone   he has it turned off|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|daman: This is very embarrassing for the CBF|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mcbear: should easily get to slam here|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: If someone is in Regina and close to the venue, please let me know|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Looks as if 3@d was some sort of game forcing checkback and 3@s showed 3 spades. Cue bidding will probably get them to slam|pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: this seems like the correct auction   up to 4NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this is a joke really|pg||
nt|daman: They can do it in Tibet and Rwanda but not in Canada|pg||
nt|mcbear: hi martin|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: please ignore the play, is clearly wrong|pg||
nt|mcbear: one would hope so|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if we are to ignore the setup, the aution and the play we may have a problem|pg||
nt|daman: I'm going to have a slice of hot banana bread slathered in butter while we wait|pg||
nt|mcbear: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: relax Roland :)|pg||

nt|daman: I would hate to be from another City and have an emergency     you cannot contact one person at the event|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I prefer a remote control if you don't mind|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcbear: I am trying to get ahold of some of the open players to tell operator there is a problem|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: she really didn't bid game|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: they are lucky this didn't get doubled|pg||
nt|daman: The final contract has to be 3@S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, Lee felt that 3@S had to be invitational because north had no other way to invite game|pg||
nt|peachy: and they are vul|pg||
nt|peachy: Bill could be right|pg||
nt|athene: that is something worth discussing for any partnership - it can apply equally if you open a weak-2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double or 3@H can be invite, 3@S is not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say it goes 2@S, 3@H overcall 3@S from your partner|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: is that purely competitive?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: if so does partner just guess to bid 4 with a game invitation?|pg||
nt|athene: you don't really want to give up on double being penalty there|pg||
nt|athene: on this auction, yes, maybe you can play 3@H last train as the game try|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|daman: South is red    if North has a shot at game    she will bid it     I know her well|pg||
