mb|p|nt|ballebodk: i agree in the 3 cl opening, but here it wasnt good and ns miss a good vul 4 sp|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  down 2 in open room   11 imps for Netherlands|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: but - at least in teams - declarer should have played @sA and @s10 before the last trumph. a good player can duck @sJ|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: double by north|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kirp:  As predicted!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Hi all|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S play either straight forward 2/1 or transfer after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: N opened 3 @c and E made a nonleaping Michaels 4@d, so 4@h was wrongsided and got a @d lead|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT by South is not bad with spade lead from King|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes @H + @D behave well|pg||
nt|rmb1: Meanwhile South could X or bid NT now|pg||
nt|ady: not wild about 2@S from east|pg||
nt|jbgood: 500 in 2@s x - but that will not happen|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|kirp:  S takes ull by the horns|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Nice bid by South!|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jbgood: and now 3 NT?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: you might have seen me playing with Olsen on BBO, his nick is James950|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's actually a regular on BBO |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nowhere else to go?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5@c also good|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: is club ace realistic lead|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S North?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 4@H will be more interesting|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 4@h:) at least on a spade lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: or duck of heart lead now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: a clear duck! If declarer has @hAjxxx why not finess?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: i think it is, this play only makes sense if south has heart ace|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps N might have tried 3@s over 3 @h?|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what are the best chances? enter dummy on @sA and play a small @h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: small heart from hand trick 2 looks fine|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|rmb1: @C finesse and @H finesse|pg||
nt|ady: re hi all   got disconnected|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|ady: see they chose the 4-3 heart fit     looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|rmb1: More effective auction in OR|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up the hearts   but clubs blocked  so will hav e to lose 1 more|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobholl: 8 of @S grows for the 10 th trick :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: slam could easily be on a finesse or even better, and game is unlikely to fail, so i think exploration is fine|pg||
nt|bobholl: it looks on 2 finesses both wrong :)|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: N/S can make 3@h and E/W can make 3@d, but need accurate play to make 3@H I think|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kirp:  3@H looks ambitious on 43|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@d was suction|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @H or @s and @c|pg||
nt|rmb1: According to their card, South could open 1NT,  not sure why he didn't|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: 3@D probably for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@h might be tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this 2@D is a new species, at least for me|pg||
nt|kirp:  curious to see how high EW get now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 2@s on the way to 3@d?|pg||
nt|ady: bad diamond split may beat this|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|kirp:  E showed 5-7 hcp, so no strain on raise to 3@D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this just needs @C Ace onside, (or Ax @S?)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rmb1: Loose one @D and ruff one, could be just one @D loser|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may lose to the king and ruff one - that would give 10|pg||
nt|ady: yes    will have to take care|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jbgood: sry Robin - not a deliberate copy:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|rmb1: Yes.  Not always true that 3 losers is 10 winners|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|STRIK3R: will find the A of @c and @s after 1@d, since 1@h was a freely bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: this looks very good for NS, all games down and lots of values|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks on any lead, so a nice stop|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|oosmanb: actually maybe it also needs A@S onside or @D 2-2, so you can get to 2nd @c trick|pg||

nt|chilloncan: another preempt on a hand full of theoretical flaws for the action, though this time NV. zealots of preemption are willing to take the risk that multiple flaws carry because of the ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: frequent success of pressure. also, sometimnes the flaws themselves may b e merits in disguise, e.g. protecting doubleton queens. of course if they know your style a lot of that is ...|pg||

nt|ballebodk: but can declarer make 4 h if he do everything right ?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|bobholl: yes if he guesses @H |pg||

nt|STRIK3R: if guessing right in @h's|pg||

mb|3D|nt|rmb1: Can make 4@H if there is only 1 @H loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hardly recommended but brown would have done well to balance with double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will hav e to drop honor doubleton heart in north hand   and bring in 5 club tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: X from East?  4@C seems too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  14-16 hcp, 3@C is simple Stayman|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jbgood: stole it|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club switch now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. Either a @d lead or continue with @s|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @c lead ?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kirp:  3N is fairly lucky to make, 3@C could be 5 CMS looking at 3@S bid to show 4@Hs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can he play on @C instead of @H ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  W showed @S if any 4 crd major, so @S lead is not best usually|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|kirp:  may play on @Hs |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: this is what happened!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kirp:  small @H best now, but @D finesse works|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: considering his middelcards in @c, playing one round on @h's was more attempting, needed to try @c's if first @h failed?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Team Angelini picked up more imps in board 2 when the other room bid 3NT instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|kirp:  ad hope NY couldn't take 3@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: a fair punt, but didnt work out|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes, I guess J@H onside is higher %age than @C 3-3? |pg||
nt|kirp:  3@S lead certainly gave defense little chance to figure out what to do|pg||
nt|kirp:  if @H J is onside, then has time to test @Cs and if not 33, then @Ds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D finesse|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt he need @d finesse in any case? |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|c6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jbgood: needed to safety play diamonds to win|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: likely not much difference here since NS on for 4@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  still only 8 trix with J@H onside|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to get 3@d tricks, so @d finesse is very much needed|pg||
nt|kirp:  S should have continued @Hs ,then needed @D finesse|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|bobholl: i guess they often do but after a high colour it is support in competition|pg||
mb|d|nt|wstuart: (For their 2NT bid)  It's an interesting situation in that many pairs have several competitive agreements which pertain to that auction.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Lots of choices here for east|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@S raise, 2@H limit raise, 3@H mixed raise|pg||

mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|wstuart: West's 3@S was likely his weakest action over the 4 card LR (2NT).|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|wstuart: Since 2NT forced them to 3@S, his pass would have suggested a not quite minimum overcall.|pg||
nt|bobholl: you could play it also reversed wayne :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, I was just talking to a spec about that.|pg||
nt|wstuart: They are very close in relative value, but most pairs play pass weaker than bid in these situaions (which is also my pref)/|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@S migth even go down after 2@H @D bucked and a @S finesse anyway :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: The most important thing, as with most, is to understand the situation and have an agreement about it.|pg||
nt|bobholl: brink drijver have discussed almost every situation and made strange (!?) arrangements |pg||
nt|wstuart: West is going to play east for a bunch of minor HCP.  This is because he needs him to have them to have a chance at beating the contract.|pg||

nt|ballebodk: wouw - that is a very hard 4 h from s !|pg||
nt|bobholl: they probably play double now as i want to bid on :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Since it has no value as a blocking bid, it's effectively a sacrifice invitation, bringing the preemptor back into the auction.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he doesnt like his chances defending 3S, and i agree with bob|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|wstuart: Oh, I though he bid 3@H not 2@H|pg||

nt|wstuart: It won't be that bad will it?  just a 5 IMP swing or so?|pg||

nt|wstuart: With 4@S now making in the closed room, this will be costly for the Aussies.|pg||

nt|wstuart: Kiwi/Aussie, I'm told.  :) sorry about that.|pg||

nt|ballebodk: the defense from N in closed room dont win any goldmedals :) |pg||
nt|bobholl: only -1 now |pg||
nt|wstuart: From west's perspective, he has some HCP and a very distr hand opposite a weak hand with a lot of trumps.  He's not sure he can make 4@S, so why does he need to DBL 5@H?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i would expect 4 spades opposite, and if he has a stiff heart i would expect to make. if not, he could have a minor card or club finese could be on. i would expect to make 4S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|nt|bobholl: he thinks 2@H losers a@C and a @D so he'll be glad until comparing with his teammates bad result|pg||

nt|rmb1: 1@C was 16+ artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 61% for NS on board 6, nobody made 3@C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but with a 10 card fit, vulnerable, can Fjaelberg put the brakes on |pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H can make if W does not switch to @S when in with the A@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: How? even if @C are stripped East has 4th @d to exit?|pg||
nt|kirp:  8@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Ah right, |pg||
nt|jbgood: guess X shows 4-5+ spades?|pg||
nt|ady: down 1  would sedem unless a slip|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|oosmanb: Well spotted Martin|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: might get to 4 now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: S could never hope to buy the contract in @hs - so perhaps xx in stead of 2 @h to indicate a high @h honor might have worked better|pg||

nt|vugraphpl7: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 100%|pg||
nt|kirp:  he was hoping NS would duck k@C and then he could switch to @Ds|pg||
nt|rmb1: 13 back. 5@D played by W in OR|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ralfwil: instead of about 95%|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Potential for Jans to pull some imps back then|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@H in N/S|pg||
nt|ady: swingy srt|pg||
nt|jbgood: same opening in the OR - but W preferred 5@d|pg||
nt|ady: set|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thanks to BBO and EBL for organising.  Thanks to operator.  Thanks to David and Jon|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
mb|2C|nt|STRIK3R: Yes, playing the K works if AQ is not on same hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|jr7: 4@S in Ø/V only 2 down|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT  even on a heart lead    but unlikely to get there|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kirp:    think tahts what he was hoping for|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: actually cost more than 20%|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  doomed on early heart play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: They've bought the hand|pg||
nt|ady: well stopped    |pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: cannot fault e/w for not playing 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|jr7: 1@C is strog, 2@C = diamond|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now north needs to hold 10xx of hearts or another disaster|pg||
nt|kirp:  this looks straightforward|pg||
nt|ady: thx all    interesting set|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|jr7: strong|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kirp:  9 or 10 trix|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: wont take long|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Last hand of the segment, but LOTS more bridge to come!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Thank you to the organizers, and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|kirp:  ciao|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hade|pg||
nt|jbgood: some really astonishing actions - great show|pg||
nt|ady: well Aptekar got to 3NT in OR   surprising   so finishing a close match|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rmb1: More back for Apteker.  EW have played well and perhaps deserved a bigger margin|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Next segment in 15 mins|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: club jack is going for another swindle|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but dubious since now both players guard clubs|pg||
