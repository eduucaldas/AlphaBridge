mb|1S|mb|d|mb|3S|nt|pelu: Hi all - as every time there are problems before the first match - players has to find the right table and so on|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3NT or 5@c both cold here|pg||
nt|chmitty: not an easy bid for North|pg||
nt|chmitty: Can our operator disclose the names of the players sitting EW ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: oh yes :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: ty|pg||
nt|peachy: He might go for the practical 3NT if this were MPs, not so sure IMPs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5c for ns if they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: not with odds - but better that a "Roland-slam"|pg||
nt|bernix: part score battle again. can NS buy it in 3@h ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all, gutten morgen Bernard|pg||
nt|bernix: hi danilo|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Pleased to see that South has a name, but I think I'll stick with 'South'|pg||
nt|granguru:  exchange black QÂ´s and it would have been a rock iron contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: we begin with a possible slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Rodwell did open the N hand with 1NT???|pg||
nt|chmitty: Difficult for South to imagine he has so many defensive tricks !|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will North x now ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hope for him there was not too much of an hesitation behind the screen|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S might have doubled. Vul versus notvul, N had great expectations of making, the colors tell he was not preempting|pg||
nt|chmitty: I agree 100% Raija|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: Hi John|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  I would have done it if @CK|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think many in the field will bid this one|pg||
nt|chmitty: he must protect the score of his pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  NICE TO see u again Raija |pg||
nt|granguru:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Convention cards are not available so unfprtunately we cannot explain bidding|pg||
nt|granguru:  at NT or any Moysean|pg||
nt|chmitty: Next door bidding started 2@s (E) 4@s ... NOrth thinking|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|pelu: and I would open 1@D 100% (=4+@d)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North has distribution and they have a lot of controls|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@C cue X @Cs|pg||
nt|granguru:  N could have xx to show second round ctrl|pg||
nt|pelu: when N open 1Nt then Meckstroth has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|pelu: RD = 1. round control|pg||
nt|granguru:  but then it is more complicate to show @d ctrls|pg||
nt|granguru:  RD is second if 4@C was first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmmm and a 6-3 c fit not too imp;ressive|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c instead of 2nd x would have worked better|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu: @H-lead - 2x@s and @C finess|pg||
nt|psyck: same bidding in other room though|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: ok that makes life easyer for dsecl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: although 4-2 foirtunate lie in h|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's standard in Poland overcalls are limited, so strong 1-suited hand should X first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course but no 2nd x for me|pg||
nt|ntmon: but after preemptive raise, problems arise|pg||
nt|psyck: if 1345, i'd have Xed 2nd time too, thought 4@c was clearer this hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|granguru:  If I would be forced to guess  1@C strong 1@S=4 ctrls 2N nat 19-21 3@D @C ctrl no @D ctrl|pg||
nt|bernix: phantom sac|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  It is much easier for us, but can South have less than this to make a slam try with no heart control?|pg||
nt|danilo1: ideal def. is - first @H for A, than @DK and third @D ... guess not easy for Adam now ... since North cann well be single @D |pg||
nt|bernix: but it doesn't matter if he cashes a 2nd @d before switching to hearts|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ntmon: i'm inclined to 4@C too but no strong opinion|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: lots of work in 6NT, not impossible I think, but rather aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  a passive lead is a must here|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm thinking E will lead club, that would be my choice|pg||
nt|granguru:  it seems 3@d was nat as N went on to 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: but I am not in Hurd's class of player so we'll see|pg||
nt|granguru:  most passive is @D|pg||
nt|granguru:  the @D10 is a critical card (not here thou) so W has 4 critical suits|pg||
nt|psyck: sry folks, have to switch to another room, c ya|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ntmon: see u later :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: slan|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru:  N S expects that @S dont behave...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: do u know players where cuebid are 1. control - to day 1. or 2.? back in the 50'es in US they only cuebid Aces - and lost to Italy every time :)|pg||
nt|peachy: that would have been my last choice of leads, Jxx nearly never right|pg||
nt|granguru:  I am wrong E leads|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|granguru:  E has a clear @d lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: Versace will not escape 800 |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|danilo1: excellent defense ... now even -2 possible |pg||
nt|bernix: caiti must use his only entry to dummy to finesse in @cs rather than @ss|pg||
nt|danilo1: did not matter for -1, I agree Bernard|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Operator, West is  Caiti|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps there is something in the bidding that we are not privvy to, which induced the spade lead|pg||

nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it is a good idea that the very first control is A (or KQ)|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|granguru:  not vul sorry only 22!|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, by the end of tha match, maybe I learn some French by osmosis :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and me some English|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the usual 4-1 break|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at least the sa is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: 2@d both majors ?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chmitty: seems so|pg||
nt|peachy: Long time ago, we used to call those bids Polish two suiters, nowadays there are several variations and names for them|pg||
nt|peachy: Hungarian kib tells it is 5@h-4@s, or 4414 or 4405, 11-15HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  would like to hear your arguments...I am open minded :)|pg||
nt|bernix: this looks like a run-of-the-mill 4@s to me|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chmitty: So Lauria will probably reject the option of double ... which could be effective in front of a @s lenght|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  kibz might enjoy an expert view on the matter|pg||
nt|paulg:  I don't think cue bidding first and second round controls equally makes a huge difference to bidding slams, a lot of it still comes down to judgement|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|paulg:  i think the italians beat the americans so often because they had practised partnerships and better bidding methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  being an  expensive deparment players try to reduce judgement and increase accuracy|pg||
nt|granguru:  good advice...on all contracts under 6NT|pg||
nt|peachy: There are no convention cards available for us (or anyone) so appreciate kib help in interpreting bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought they play transfers over 1c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: 3@c sounds like maximum with 5-card suit doesnt it|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk NS play 1NT 15-17 (or at least did before) ... 1@C is choice I believe (agree, 6 controls, no soft values, hand better for suit contracts)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|granguru:  agree paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand has another debatable point .. how do you break transfers?|pg||
nt|pelu: too difficult to start a cue bid if only A, a cue is an invitation for slam and often u will miss that - and bidding economy also tell u to start with the lovers cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Since there were so many small boards in the first half, I was hoping that all the spectacular stuff had been saved for the second half. False hopes...|pg||
nt|granguru:  from 6NT on the strategy changes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 toptricks for defense, but not easy to take them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i dislike showing a weak doubleton and telling them what to lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  at top level players almost always lead the right card|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|granguru:  so it is better to bid accurately|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East has found a strong lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: now 7 tricks for Tokay|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3@C dont show about @Cs but only maxz and 3 card support|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i approve of breaking the transfer with only 3-card support, when you are so suitable|pg||
nt|granguru:  once hamman erred a gran slam lead...20 years the hand was appearing in the news|pg||
nt|peachy: running scores Round 3 (this round) http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda3.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  And he used Judgement..with 2 aces he led the shortest one..(wrong)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ntmon: i think they play crystallic clear Polish club, book version (2005 edition)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be as JASSEMS polish is transfer inh his book|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chmitty: Great decision by Lauria : 5@c would be at least 2 off when 4@h is down|pg||
nt|peachy: I did find a fairly recent card for EW http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|c7|nt|MolvaM: running a long suit usually creates problems for the defence|pg||
nt|peachy: NS basic system is Strong Club|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Now a club ruff will beat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with best defence. a @c switch now|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @h9 ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  looks to ask for @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Failing that, a trump misguess by declarer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in that case possibilities to -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  E isn't willing to ask for a @c switch, not knowing what partner has in @c I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was declarer, after a transfer response to 1@C, at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if there is any possibility to defeat, it must be a @c ruff by E. Declarer can have @sKQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW missed the defense against 4@S - played by S: @H to K, @D to A Now @CK to A, @S to 8 and Q, @CJ to Q - but not @C again|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: now 9|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|pelu: well played by W - he set up a trap - and N fall in|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and looking happily for the 10th|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@S is not good contract ... correct pass by Balicki ... |pg||
pc|s2|nt|ntmon: transfers don't fit much into the system, 1@D needs to be negative|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h8|nt|granguru:  looks that there is no way to win...no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  @DK ?|pg||
nt|peachy: There are 15 groups of 8 teams each, the top three (I think) will advance to the Swiss, from where top teams advance to KO etc|pg||
nt|peachy: This isnt quite making, I think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru:  what about small @d ?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ntmon: anyway, 4@H good contract, will make|pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: from each group|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: So the chance is missed.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: Ralf's analysis is good. It does seem that a club switch was indicated.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|granguru:  at 6NT the reason is not to give the 12th trick ...normally declarer coudnt find a suit to play...so usually no long suit..if 12 tricks there, there is nothing to lose...but if just 11 you must be carefull not to give 1 trick on the lead.|pg||

nt|granguru:  garozzo had another saying..when you have a singleton, lead it...|pg||
nt|granguru:  obviously at suit contracts|pg||
nt|peachy: It is one of his famous "Rules"|pg||
nt|granguru:  in general, it made life easier for the defense...if you didnt lead a singleton..you didnt have it...|pg||
nt|peachy: Another one of Garozzo's: "Must have a very good reason for not leading trump"|pg||
nt|danilo1: he knows that pd must have very good @S + need @HK + more than just A in @D ... if all this, Adam would not bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||

mb|2H|nt|granguru:  well if @H behave he could have made it..but that would have mean @S were also 1-1 and the line should have been different|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but a good sacrifice too|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|pelu: top-players dont like the @d-suit :)|pg||

nt|chmitty: Will south bid 3NT with 3 small spades ?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|peachy: 2C prob Precision style, 5-6 clubs with possible 4-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  tough lead|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  nothing appeals, @d looks normal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I know about 3700 people who would bid 2nt with east hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  as I said at the beginning ..probably @S finesse instead of a @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is 2s not forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Mahaffey won the first match 17-13 against a team from Romania (with Bocchi-Maddala!?), Aspe lost 10-20 to a strong team from England|pg||
nt|granguru:  panski plays 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  leading the longest suit is always an option|pg||
nt|ntmon: very hard to find @D fit because of intervetion and inevitable raise|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: good contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c more precise : no major and only one stopper ... South assumes the stopper is @s :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@H is I guess 3NT try ... Cezary knows how valid is @CQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  that's why she bid 3 :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe 2@D?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but that dont help|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ralfwil: how many @s from W? I vote for 3@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  i expect double shows the majors|pg||
nt|pelu: nice play to get 7 tricks in 2@c|pg||
nt|peachy: There certainly are very good reasons not to lead trump, but if one cant find one, then...trump|pg||
nt|granguru:  aaah yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  a good partner has the J|pg||

nt|ralfwil: anyone with me?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  with 2@d?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Closer to 3@S than 1@S, perhaps.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  1@s looks a little timid to me|pg||
nt|pelu: strange take out X by Baldurson|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a 6-card suit @hK and a stiff @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade game needs to be bid.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  good sacrifice in 5@d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1@s probably shows 3 card spades?|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - prob support x in @H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or a dont-lead-a-diamond system|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I don't know that 1@H was right when East had indicated the majors.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe it was also meant to show real @c|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  unsure though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me a strong 3@s rise and an invite to 4@s|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and baldurson dbl is kind of a support dbl?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok he was down 2 - but recived a gift|pg||
nt|danilo1: interested in choice what/how to bid by South (1@C Polish, most often 12-14 BAL) |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Allerton may have misread 3@H but East can correct.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, this is the sort of board we were looking for, after so much drab stuff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he has a pretty good hand, in context|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you agree with the strong rise David?|pg||
nt|peachy: Strong 1C, probable 0-7 or some such 1D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|granguru:  under this premise I agree fully..the same philosophy of the 6NT lead..dont give tricks away to declarer on the initial lead.|pg||
nt|granguru:  when you have points in all side suits normally declarer has a solid trump suit...|pg||
nt|ntmon: worked!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the best with this bidding is that W has shown his @h honour|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe their standard for free bids is higher than yours and mine|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C may be @D transfer, or kind of asking - if so 2@D may just show min.|pg||

pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Although we may quibble with the odd bid or two, it seems that the players have judged it very well around the table. |pg||
nt|rcerreto:  anyway, they succeeded in bidding the par|pg||
nt|brolucius: The term 'free bid' was responsible for a lot of awful bidding many decades ago.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|brolucius: 4@D made against the 300 here, so a big swing to Badger.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was wondering if South would overcall 1@s, easier to overcall 1NT perhaps|pg||
nt|granguru:  probasbly e could have avoided the mistake overtaking @D and playing @c9|pg||
nt|paulg:  west cannot make a penalty double these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again 1Nt with a 5 card @S - |pg||
mb|1S|nt|murat: and now ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 1NT 12-16 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North was in 3NT at the other table, doubled and ran to 4@D.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be hearts and a minor, so North asks|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1NTx was sort of +380 but Soith escapes|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok: 2@d showed a 11-13 hand with 3@h. sry for this mess, but its really difficult to guess the meaning of ART bids. And its boring to be silent... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: not the best lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3d could be makable but tokay wasnt sure about 5 cards @d|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS guessing can win 3@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1D! negative, 0-6(7) |pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|rcerreto:  do EW play transfer?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Transfers opposite 1@C are popular.|pg||
nt|granguru:  we will see a good fight here|pg||
nt|granguru:  as 2@S is a difficult contract to win|pg||
nt|ntmon: or not|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: With four aces missing, it seems that the three-level may be high enough.|pg||
nt|pelu: that the problem with 1@D opening - partner dont know if u have 2 or 5 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 4@s - but US never found the @s-fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  mmm|pg||
nt|granguru:  Does S have nothing clear  to lead?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chmitty: and Lauria does not give up|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok this looks obvious here :) |pg||
nt|riccho:  15 vs. 8 HCP --> both players are a bit exaggerating their hands|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: Not knowing their system, North's Pass might have included better hands, and wek hands run immediately via Rdbl, that is one way of playing|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure how obvious is 3NT by East ... he is min, and 2 open suits ... OK, has 3 tens and 5-card @C ... still|pg||
nt|riccho:  now decl has 9 tricks in his bag. I c no other option than to play for @c to be 3-3 (or Hx somewhere). |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong lead .... and big diff. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Obviously East had read West for a much better hand than he holds.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: and I can´t see why...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|riccho:  E needs 33 in @c without alternative, because due to communication problems he has to duck @c immediately |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Such a shame to lose IMPs unnecessarily when there are so many other ways of losing IMPs.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  could W consider his hand balanced?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then open 1NT (or rebidding, if 1NT is weak)?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was presumably non-forcing, so it is hard to see how East had enough to look for an 11-trick game.|pg||
nt|granguru:  well he treated the  hand as a croos ruffing type|pg||
nt|granguru:  and protected potential @d tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Protected diamond tricks I think|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: If 1@s is´nt spades, 1nt from W looks normal for me |pg||

nt|chmitty: yep ... may be here they are in some "hole" of their system|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: Although, 2D foes not necessarily promise 4+ diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: In my opinion, the range 12-16 is susceptible to trouble at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: kib says my suggeswted method is common in Hungary, but we still dont know if NS play that way|pg||
nt|riccho:  with 23 HCP and no fit you have to be lucky to succeed in 3NT... |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong = unlucky (lead) |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|ady: e/w are in the bidding and have a good save in clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: good save is an oxymoron|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@S seems secure though ... the defence can't force in both minors|pg||
nt|ady: unless 2 diamond ruffs can be negotiated|pg||
nt|bigtrain: besides it goes 500 here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe 5@S is not totally secure ...|pg||
nt|ady: 500 unlikely    if west plays|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is 4@D a splinter bid Walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 500 is easy -- i'd be disappointed if they don't produce it|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that's why it's pretty easy...  small @D (suit pref for @H) small heart to queen etc|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Walter, that works because the singleton is the ace ... |pg||
nt|bjacobs: But you'd feel pretty sick if they won the diamond then took 11 tricks in the minors, and you had 3 major suit tricks on top|pg||
nt|bigtrain: also works when partner has @C ace instead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: note he did splinter so needs an ace for those values|pg||
nt|ady: great score for Mahaffey   5@C  down 2   100 in CR|pg||
nt|bjacobs: not @SA instead?|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: and of course i mispoke...  he would lead a high @D since the 2 suits are @S and @H so wants the low suit|pg||

nt|danilo1: another case for invitational bid ... and pass ... especiall when playing vs. excellent defenders ... |pg||

nt|bigtrain: i think he's seen enough of meck's dummys to know that it isn't |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Certainly 3NT can be made double dummy - you just have to guess well|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT down in CR   there are different possible lines   but would have tht would come to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bigtrain: it will be interesting to watch because that's where they're heading|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a pretty devilish contract.  Decide what you would do on a spade lead, and compare with what Meckwell does|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|bjacobs: Jassem played on hearts, rather than clubs, which does seem a little surprising|pg||

nt|granguru:  panski is trying to cash all defensive tricks bfore it is too late|pg||
nt|chmitty: a nice "challenge the champs" deal here|pg||
nt|chmitty: 7@h = 20/20|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Kamil's team is listed as transnational, not USA, in the event|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  S multi 2@D|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for Meckwell in the other room (probably not the last time we'll say that in this championship)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  I've noticed many pairs treat the Multi 2@d as weak with spades when it comes to their 2nd seat defence|pg||
nt|pelu: and 5@H close to make on a small @S-lead |pg||
nt|paulg:  it's rare to see that in the UK, but would work here|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@h from North?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk3: No credit for my hy-phen?|pg||
nt|pelu: for D = balanced 12-15 or any 16+|pg||
nt|pelu: for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  Amoil played for SA in the world teams in bermuda 2000 |pg||
nt|peachy: really light third-seater here|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: i thought that he is from Usa becouse he doesn't exist in EBL base|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  that is the norm in the UK too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|ntmon: strong @C variety, finally|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  4@d will be 'bid your major' (4@c would have been transfer to your major)|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes many play 2@D x= short in @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by West|pg||
nt|granguru:  and 2@d - 2@h 5+ @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is similar to the situation in the Open Room, where West doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: forcing pass in N?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brolucius: Be careful because jtr is watching.|pg||
nt|granguru:  now a correct flag in W ...thanks Michal|pg||
nt|peachy: and another 16+ 1C here, maybe they have additional agreements on what constitutes a 1C opening that we do not know about |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: ??? dbl from me as E|pg||
nt|paulg:  surely not a forcing pass situation|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: but East help him, in on @CK he played @D - ruff, @C to A @S to 10 and duck - and now endplayed - East sh play @C back and no endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  a cheap save on 4@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S has escaped a double, but the cards lie well for declarer so the lack of a double will not cost E/W much.|pg||
nt|granguru:  In the meanwhile NS surpassed the safet level of 5@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  is 6@C makeable?|pg||
nt|granguru:  after A GAROZZO's lead|pg||
nt|peachy: on the surface, looks like just lose a spade, whether the tricks are there is another matter|pg||
nt|peachy: Kib who knows NS style says they love to surprise opps with frequent tactical bids|pg||
nt|riccho:  1 trick in every suit for ew = just make|pg||
mb|3N|nt|danilo1: despite 3NT looks makable for NS ... good defense should beat it ... so good stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but still a dbl....|pg||
nt|granguru:  2 discards on reds|pg||
nt|chmitty: as long as they do not surprise themselves that's fine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: why not - u have bid game Red against green |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: its for me a good standard rule|pg||
nt|chmitty: Full brakes on, from North's standpoint|pg||
nt|chmitty: South has a lot ... can he give up ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 6 controls opposite strong club, he just cant pass|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: choice of plays - hate thast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably play on d and postpone finesses|pg||
nt|ntmon: on  17, meckwell started as reccomended: 1@S-2N-4@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps @H finesse, if ducked revert to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: little point in ducking|pg||
nt|ntmon: not an easy hand due to communication problems|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so many choices|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Had the cards lain differently, not doubling might have waved goodbye to 500 or so.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may have feared a third-hand opener, but her side was vulnerable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not know that partner holds 10 points, so he cannot double 4@S even with an extra value or so. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but shouldn´t E?|pg||
nt|pelu: now N can make 1NT - topplay @Hs and only 6 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  3 discards on reds sorry|pg||
nt|granguru:  one @S given up|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The contract is doubled at both tables in the other match|pg||
nt|granguru:  so just one ruff needed|pg||
nt|peachy: It is also possible that 4S was RKC|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Quite right.|pg||
nt|chmitty: May be 4@s was kind of blackwood|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: it does make|pg||
nt|granguru:  not even garozzo beats 6@c here|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|peachy: WD White House team|pg||
nt|peachy: It would be nice if in a competition of this level, there were convention cards available|pg||
nt|chmitty: true :(|pg||
nt|chmitty: True also that there are many pairs in competition : huge job|pg||
nt|peachy: It makes kibitzing so much nicer, to know what the auction means|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chmitty: a suggestion could be that the players had to fill themselves an "electronic convention card" before the championship|pg||
nt|ntmon: right, John :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: its a headache hand |pg||
nt|ntmon: agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: d suit may die now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chmitty: that will come soon, I'm sure|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|murat: he should played the Ace @h|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and just did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont think he found the best line entries are very short for finessing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant even get a s if d is returned|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  it is a good standard rule for me too, but not when one hand has pre-empted|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Now East may grab @CA.|pg||
nt|dburn: chances are that since East didn't double here South might get the clubs wrong|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|murat: now he's in trouble|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: for me "multi" is nor real preemt - just a semicontructiv opening bid|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong @hA ok if 3-3 and @H 10 nevber correct|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|murat: did he really discard @h ?|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  should she risk -420 to get 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|dburn: risk? what risk?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to risk a double in the first place.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: An excellent 6@D now|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer could have the singleton king of clubs only if she had about ten cards rather than thirteen|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  can declarer have one more @d one less @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on NS - a nice contract|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  N was declarer, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In theory, there is a club ruff, but fortunately for declarer, the defender with the singleton club also has @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting bidding test. If they bid it, I will applaud.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C is more tricky and that might be reached.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They may arrive in 6@C, though|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With problems on a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can they make 1C after a @c lead? I doubt|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the sort of board we were hoping for. No-one wants these matches to be decided on small margins after some drab boards.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @s lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c after a @s lead....|pg||
nt|peachy: In "real" championships, I think that is how it is done, these championships are open to anybody who wants enter from anywhere in the world, no qualification required|pg||
nt|danilo1: running scores now on: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|riccho:  a matter of style and system if u open the N hand with 1@c 2@c or 3@c|pg||
nt|riccho:  or even pass |pg||
nt|riccho:  3@c wouldnÂ´t be my choice anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i venture to say this was misplayed|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: If one side wins after doing better on the big boards, then good luck to them - (even if they are not from England)|pg||
nt|murat: that was unexpected|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the contract went both ways during play and finally declarer came out as the winner|pg||
nt|paulg:  Seeing your partner pass when you have a balanced zero count is never good|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|pelu: 34 HCP - I exp slam with most tables|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s now from South?|pg||
nt|peachy: And teams can have members from any country = all transnational|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C precision style ... part of Polish @C system|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  so a precision like 2@c opening here |pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays @d before havinc cleaned trumps, another @s will set up a trumph trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: D'Ovidio has started well by emphasizing the diamonds before supporting clubs.|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS has a score sheet we all like to bring to the comparison table...all NS scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 6@C in the closed room|pg||

nt|murat: would you also prefer 2@s ?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Imagine winning the board with 3NT.|pg||

nt|chmitty: ha can : a) play Ace @h and @h or b) play small @h to retain an extra entry in dummy or c) unblock @s ace and run Q @h|pg||

nt|pelu: for 100% 2NT|pg||

pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: jassem may be lucky|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||

nt|riccho:  now he has 9 tricks in his bag |pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|pelu: many play that 1@D - 2@D = no 4 card major|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, 20+ IMPs swing due to a 4-1 break. Well, that's part of the game. Hard to take, though.|pg||
nt|murat: he was afraid of Q@c |pg||
nt|danilo1: @C continuation would beat|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: @cQ and @S back and Tokay will regret that he used his only entry to dummy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kibs are shocked... to play clubs from hand is purely double dummy. he cant do that|pg||
nt|pelu: but against storng defense his plan sh fail|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he can hope that @cA is with north but very hard to play for both honors to be there|pg||
nt|pelu: if S has showed distrbution in the black suits - and easy defense for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well some days even 2 club tricks could be enough|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could catch the @dQ|pg||
nt|murat: he's hopeless now|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, Allerton-Leslie will think that they may have had a very big board.|pg||
nt|pelu: same did N :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would be bidding hearts on the next round|pg||
nt|granguru:  I think it is the correct way |pg||
nt|pelu: yes and that would show @H-stopper and bad @ss|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem - at boprt tables was Ss bold @s-bid|pg||
nt|chmitty: last board for today|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  he might have tried to endplay N with @sA and another|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A question of RKCB when the spade fit comes to light.|pg||
nt|ntmon: jassem lucky on  17 where 5@S went down, so gain for udertricks at both rooms|pg||
mb|1C|nt|MolvaM: for kibs who ask|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the other table scores are unreachable|pg||
nt|murat: Lavazza should get the comfortable lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but lavaza leads by a comfortable margin of approx 30 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Thank you kibitzers, ope you enjoyed.  And thank you for your active participation with comments and questions, we are all here ONLy for you.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: 4@c from me as W|pg||
nt|Walddk3: So Zimmermann by 6 in a minute|pg||
nt|pelu: sory a solid win for Lawazza - my calculations (:)) 37-1|pg||
nt|chmitty: ty Raija :)@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Multon won the diamond at trick 2 and paused for a while before he played another spade|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: E/W fighting bravely, but hard to imagine that it will be successfully.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that looked like broadcasting a football match on radio :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a very normal way to bid on Ns hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  I played Mahaffey on vugraph in last year's Rosenblum ... luckily Meckwell were in Nickell's team on that occasion|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: All good pairs will know what to do after intervention over 4NT (in theory....)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Vriend team on their way to the final; 32-9 after a slam swing on board 23, like here|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand now, thanks to our operator Michal for a great job! Also thanks to EBL for getting these great matches shown on BBO.|pg||
nt|peachy: Also thanks to our opearor for a great job!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: it was a reasonnable 6@c slam here but that will be for another day :) SO enjoy your evening (day) and see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|d8|nt|murat: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract in OR|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and will gain on 18 as well - odd|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the open event at this stage consists of short matches of 10 boards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so this is the last hand of the segment|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzers, you are the life of this party, appreciate all your comments and questions!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  I think 1NT as semi-forcing is quite popular, where North might pass 1NT?|pg||
nt|riccho:  some work here for decl to deny 6 defensive tricks here|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice lead by Martens|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hate that bidding - cant find a 4-4 s fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: would be a nice lead against 4@S if reached|pg||
nt|ntmon: another odd gain on  20 - on missinng the right contract?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the world-wide disease - find some level of nt as soon as possible|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk3: The official site has a score of 30-27 in this match. Not easy to know what to believe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cronier may fear a diamond ruff in 6@S, because he has offered the lower-scoring slam with excellent spade support.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to our commentators peter lund, and murat anter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and our operator michal |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and our kibitzers|pg||
pc|s3|nt|murat: my pleasure. thx everyone|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the next segment starts soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Round 3 scores  http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda3.html|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|Walddk3: I trust our operators until proven wrong|pg||
nt|peachy: And to Pierre Schmidt and all commentators for volunteering their time and expertise.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell play semi-forcing...  generally speaking meck passes all 5332s while eric bids on with 5332 maxs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru:  1@D 1@H (2@S) 2N 4@D(RKCB) 4@H(3) 4@S(Q ask) 4N (noQ)5@C(cab) 5@H(2nd round) 7@D|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|peachy: Finally, full vugraph schedule http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php so you can make plans to stay glued to your screen for more :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: next match in 30 min|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|riccho:  typical safety play situation here in @s to lose only one trump trick|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d7|pc|sQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: there are stars from each country|pg||
nt|MolvaM: including all europeans|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and the world champions from usa meckstroth rodwell too|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so just stay with us|pg||
nt|MolvaM: unofficial score is 37-1 lavazza|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but better check later with the website|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.poznan2011.pl/results|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for instance here, 2@C generally shows 4+ for meck and 3+ for roddy :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|paulg:  interesting difference in styles|pg||
nt|paulg:  I thought these top pairs/teams were supposed to simulate these situations and get a consensus|pg||
nt|pelu: how do they explai that on CC?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|danilo1: tk -1 ... opening @H trick to def |pg||
nt|riccho:  but there are as usual other considerations to make as well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bigtrain: its a matter of style|pg||
nt|danilo1: now cash 2@C |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  well, kokish at least|pg||
nt|bigtrain: note i said generally speaking|pg||
nt|pelu: but their opp sh have that information|pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: bye now, come back for more in less than 30 minutes, Round 4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: general style = agreement = on CC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they treat the 1NT as semi-forcing and announce it that way...  what they do as individuals is just my observation|pg||
pc|d9|nt|riccho:  defenders are stripping there hands here. An endplay may be possible now|pg||
mc|7|nt|ntmon: last board of the set, next round at 13:30 CET - roughly within 40 minutes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx all - interestin set but not great bridge - I think|pg||
pg||
