mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: This is the best website ever seen|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D isn't especially slammy, just trying to get partner's co-operation over the likely 4@S/5@C|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D allows partner to assist in the competitive bidding decisions at the 5 level|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jtr: Are N/S on firm ground?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Comments in stereo, what a service|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe not|pg||
nt|athene: and in two languages - english and australian :)|pg||
nt|jtr: But West will save anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C was natural, planning to bid 3@S or 4@s over the inevitable @h bids, I think|pg||
nt|athene: certainly south's 5@C looks a bit as though he wasn't sure 3@C promised a fit|pg||
nt|jtr: Should show a fit by a passed hand though|pg||

nt|jtr: Hardly a guess with the distribution marked|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: Yes, with @D length and no sure tricks in black suits, Pass or 5@D looks best by West |pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: my guess is west thought his double just said "i don't think we can make 5 of a red suit"|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jtr: One of the problems of 4@d is that it gives away so much information|pg||

nt|jtr: Declarer was careless next door|pg||
nt|petergill: The Trick 2 switch was in case declarer had 10xx in spades I guess - perhaps Trick 1 was a situation for East to give count in @s to overcome that problem|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't bother to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe was worried about a doubleton @c with West|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: even assuming east's small spade was a count signal, west might still have worried he had only Ax|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: and a spade continuation might set up the king for a club pitch too fast or something|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda6.html|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|athene: well, either 1nt = 4+@S [not a common method], or maybe EW play Flannery?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: information www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and hence 1nt alerted because it can contain four spades|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: or 1NT includes weak raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Havent seen this is Poland|pg||
nt|athene: yes true if you are intending to bid hearts next you can bid 1nt with spades anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: Kaplan inversion isnt it called?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but i would not think that is alertable|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: kaplan inversion is where 1nt is 5+ spades i think|pg||
nt|jtr: Playing the F thing?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Only one entry to dummy to play @H, so play low to @H10?|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not brave enough to speak its name:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|athene: low to ten gains against KQx or Hx, low to 8 gains against H9x|pg||
nt|jtr: But North has shown @d length|pg||
nt|petergill: Timing is important - @C overruff danger - as cards lie, need to cross to @CK and play low @H.  |pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry - of course it doesn't|pg||
nt|athene: you can't then get back|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda6.html|pg||
nt|petergill: @S9 or Q? |pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe @sK was a better card here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence|pg||
nt|jtr: Might try a low @h|pg||
nt|jtr: With the @cs still to resolve|pg||
nt|petergill: South might lead @S10 from 10xxx, to help North out. |pg||
nt|athene: low heart towards dummy would gain in the heart suit if south had the doubleton honour but that's less likely given north has diamond length|pg||
nt|jtr: Or from K10xx for that matter|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, low @H might be best play, looking at 26 cards - if so, will South duck smoothly?|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, i agree but i think he will do that even so|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: information www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
nt|athene: these 8-card suit combinations missing KQ where you only have one dummy entry are quite common|pg||
nt|athene: and appear in different forms, like AJ10x / xxxx|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: schedule www.poznan2011.pl/schedule|pg||
nt|jtr: Still, if North has 3@hs he will surely have a maximum of 2@cs|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: bulletin www.poznan2011.pl/bulletins|pg||
nt|petergill: He doesn't know that @C are running, so he cannot tell that low @H to ten works, as third @h in dummy isn't needed for @C ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: North's thought has given away the @s position|pg||
nt|jtr: 3 cant be 5th now|pg||
nt|athene: if north has a doubleton in both hearts and clubs and NOT the @CQ, you can't ever make it, can you?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: what a difficult board to play...|pg||
nt|petergill: If @S3 was 3rd and 5th, East cannot count how many @S N has. @D appear to be 6-2 (no 3@D raise)|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has @HKQ doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: it's no use to lead a heart to the ten then cash the ace dropping his K/Q because you would need the @HJ to ruff a club with anyway so south's @H9 would wake up|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Bill - @HKQ doubleton @H in North, then can take ruffing @C hook through Qxxx|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|jtr: Maybe he will just play a @s back for the time being|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: well, south has to duck the next trump|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|athene: ok, not any more|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hK|pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: Winning play - @SA, @C to king, low heart to ten, later cash aces in @C and @H - is double dummy, perhaps unrealistic looking only at 26 cards|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and David|pg||
nt|jtr: I think maybe H9 doubleton trump with North was the best shot|pg||
nt|athene: in terms of hand evaluation, 5-5 hands are very strong when you have a nine-card trump fit, but much less so with only an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|jtr: Then take the ruffing @c finesse|pg||
nt|athene: not only do you get forced very often but there are just so many more worries with ruffing and drawing trumps|pg||
