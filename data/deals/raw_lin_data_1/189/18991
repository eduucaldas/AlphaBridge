nt|ady: sorry of course 3 losers in diamonds for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If 2 @D is a weak-2 - itÂ´s awful|pg||

nt|vugraphpl7: E: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=7668|pg||

pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: 420 is par, use entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to finess in @s immediately|pg||
nt|ady: not the way to beat 4@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jr7: Hi all - no names, but we are playing|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the trump lead doesnt hurt declarer much|pg||
nt|alok_daga: hope bidding 6 does not go unpunished as a flat brd|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Fantoni,Nunes miss this cold grand?|pg||
nt|mamos: NS rying to mess with EWs auction here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT from West - and North must lead a SMALL @S...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we start with an exciting deal|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|geot: Duboins double was of course a reasonable choice, but no success here|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bit too pushy by west although 5@D would not be a success either|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - making with the @H 10 in South|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: are these the right teams/names?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ace of @H and a @h will be a deception for North|pg||
nt|xenya: this will be painful for Lavazza|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@h better|pg||
nt|mamos: wow  seems odd to sell out to this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - 4 @H always down, as long as South does NOT take the @D King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tactic: Write a + - and win|pg||
nt|atabey: bir batara bir batar. bence taktik olarak doðru dileðin yaptýðý|pg||

nt|davpro: true|pg||
nt|suketbombi: too fast|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S x in OR hare S only open 1@S and EW could easy fins the @H-fit and bid on to 5@h|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: there is more though, some chance of a squeeze for 5|pg||
nt|mamos: letting your opponnets play 2@s-3   seems dubious tactics|pg||
pc|s7|nt|MolvaM: bu arada hazýr aramýzda iken tuna aluf ve namýk kökten çiftini de kutlayalým :)|pg||
nt|hobakan: transfer krýlmayýnca boþu boþuna agresiflik yapmayayým demiþ olabilir|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kendileri avrupa karýþýk 2li de 5. olarak bizleri gurulandýrdýlar|pg||

pc|d3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|hobakan: diðer masayý dedim.. NT açýlýþýndan sonra 41 sayý gerideyiz diye 3NT gönderir mi?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu avrupa þampiyonasý bizleri çok mutlu etti|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: they will need some expresso's|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Im not sure how EW could let NS play 1dX with only 4 trumps total|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but here it worked|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sengulerz: rakibin 3@d dememesi garip geldi bana|pg||
pc|c3|nt|geot: West wanted to cater for partner having some nice spades behind and not commit his own partnership to the 5 level |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: did upmark intend his dbl as take out? and did cullin take it as penalty?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: only a mistake in the defence can give 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: going for the maximum|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: Hi Geo, Geoffrey, & Vladimir|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kirp:  Hi y'all, EW play a Precison-based @C system, not sure what NS Play (may be Polish)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 140 looks normal - mayby 150 at the other table|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I am pretty sure that Apteker-Gower end up in 3NT|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|yusufb: evet  Tuna Aluf ile Namýk Koktenide tebrik ediyoruz:) Facebookta yazmýþtým burdada yazýyorum bu baþarýyý bekliyordum|pg||
mc|9|nt|fabsayc: but west led low diamond so error chance is real|pg||

nt|danilo1: EW may push to 3NT here ... better for them to not|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tweety1: 3nt will be bid by EW?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|danilo1: if occasional @S9lead, North must be careful not to put King ... guess this is the only possibility for ninth trick|pg||
nt|psyck: Nobody plays in 2N in this day & age I suppose|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes  all the 13 hp holders bid 3nt:)|pg||
nt|murat: especially when down by 41imps|pg||
nt|danilo1: I may tell U one who does Krishna :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|danilo1: when NV - pass or 3NT may be same swing ... actually, with -41 I would exactelly pass in search for swing as probably opps other roo will try to 'pair' with 3NT|pg||

nt|hawe45:  How to bid 3 NT - I see no way to that contract|pg||
nt|cenglund:  There is a risk to end up in 4 hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They probably open 1H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It would have more idea to open THIS West-hand with 2 @D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  It was a disaster for the South Africans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but I wouldÂ´nt do it|pg||
nt|pelu: I 100% agree with Apteker to open 4@s|pg||
nt|suketbombi: would have played @S T to queen in an unlikely event @S 9 drops singleton and @DK is doubleton then think about @CS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Patrick|pg||
nt|patricck: Hi everyone :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|pelu: another wild board|pg||
nt|roswolf: new leaders|pg||
nt|xenya: hello CK|pg||
nt|desert: hi all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and ew could perhaps have made 3nt|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet 5@c oynatmayý riske etmemesi normal bencede 11 @s biliyorken defansýda fazla yok|pg||
nt|sengulerz: tebrikler Tuna, Namýk:)|pg||
nt|yusufb: banada garip geldi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tuna ve namýk'ý bilenler bilir ama bilmeyenler için http://www.tbricfed.org.tr/|pg||
nt|hobakan: bravooooooooo!!! tbf sitesine de koyulmuþ|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: 4@H  down 2 in open room   11 imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hans , Christer , Specs good afternoon to all |pg||
nt|geot: An unusual 17 imps against a team of such a standard|pg||
nt|xenya: who is to blame on that deal?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but - at least in teams - declarer should have played @sA and @s10 before the last trumph. a good player can duck @sJ|pg||
nt|geot: West could certainly have bid 4NT, two places to play (minors at first)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cenglund:  Meck opened 1D with the puny collection of high cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The problem is: You take these two first West-hands and compare. There is TOO much fifference - so partner never will know, what you have, when you open 2 @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@D opener , with diferent type of hands|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1sp 1nt 2hrts,2spades then?|pg||
nt|patricck: A nice start for the Apteker team as EW pushed the Open room pair one level higher|pg||
nt|roswolf: double game + swing|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declared from east of course|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: double by north|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kirp:  As predicted!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Hi all|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S play either straight forward 2/1 or transfer after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: N opened 3 @c and E made a nonleaping Michaels 4@d, so 4@h was wrongsided and got a @d lead|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT by South is not bad with spade lead from King|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes @H + @D behave well|pg||
nt|rmb1: Meanwhile South could X or bid NT now|pg||
nt|ady: not wild about 2@S from east|pg||
nt|jbgood: 500 in 2@s x - but that will not happen|pg||
nt|mamos: don't know geoffrey|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only + = both hands had the 10 of @S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 11 fast reicks for N-S  in minor |pg||
nt|cenglund:  True, but I am sure they would have opened 1H, but Meck did not allow that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that a @S-shift will kill 5 @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so fast... - these 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the 11 trick of @D can be a problem in this hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt will be reached quickly here|pg||
nt|mamos: Lebensohl or equivalent here|pg||
nt|murat: good morning everybody|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|kirp:  S takes ull by the horns|pg||
nt|kirp:  bull not ull|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Nice bid by South!|pg||
nt|pelu: when the X show the black suits what is 2@C then?|pg||
nt|patricck: East has taken away North's main suit|pg||
nt|yusufb: 1@h pas diyebilirdi|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah they change|pg||
nt|suketbombi: wnats to get his @S in to picture early and bid @Cs to hilt but his party is spoiled by the 2@C bid East|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jbgood: and now 3 NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi mike|pg||
nt|mamos: Mahaffey EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least this will be fast:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead is obligatory, otherwise 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C just tell: be carefull N - bad distribution - |pg||
nt|pelu: N dont belive :)|pg||
nt|patricck: Now there is partnership confidence, having no doubts about partner misinterpreting the bid|pg||
nt|pelu: will S bid 3@S or give up?|pg||
nt|patricck: South is sitting there waiting for a power cut I think.....bet he doesn't feel happy about the auction|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@c showed majors  2NT was presumably relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: this seems to go -500|pg||
mb|2N|nt|STRIK3R: you might have seen me playing with Olsen on BBO, his nick is James950|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's actually a regular on BBO |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nowhere else to go?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5@c also good|pg||
nt|pelu: would u in S place :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: now N sh accept - his partner passed over 2@c|pg||
nt|geot: South just delay the 3NT bid here, cant really see why she did not bid 3NT over 1S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we nearly have a football team this morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is club ace realistic lead|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S North?|pg||
nt|patricck: best defence is to lead @D, A@H and another might lead to a lucky 10 tricks when the K@S falls after East has ruffed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @DS is the best Start for defence |pg||
nt|pelu: samme bidding to 3@C in OR, but here S passed|pg||
nt|pelu: Piekarek like to X|pg||
nt|patricck: no reason to double here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No @S-lead also OK naturally|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N i may be Geoffrey, but certainly not quickly|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe declarer can salvage a 7th trick in clubs|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if defence cant find their club ruff|pg||
nt|MolvaM: prev board was a 6 imp gain for rosenthal when open room found the 3nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: played by east|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ns can make 4h|pg||
nt|murat: :) |pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to find that 2@D is not the rigth defence|pg||
nt|hajru:  Welcome back everybody|pg||
nt|sengulerz: soranlara topluca yanýt.. bu þampiyona milli takýmlar þampiyonasý deðil.. takým kuran herkes katýlabilir.. onuniçin açýk turnuva.. dolayýsýyla birden çok Türk takýmý olabilir|pg||
nt|hobakan: 6 sayý vererek baþlayabilirdik. 3@c= 3 @d = þeklinde|pg||
nt|hobakan: 5 dk ara bana:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: K@S lead |pg||
nt|xenya: and not 3N... |pg||
nt|bobholl: niecely played 2 down i saw :)|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@d dememesi gercekten cok ilginç|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rmb1: 4@H will be more interesting|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 4@h:) at least on a spade lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice lead :) |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Some will be off-side|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: or duck of heart lead now|pg||
nt|pelu: best attack - now prob down more that 1|pg||
nt|mamos: what options do you think South is thinking about here Hans?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Checking the menu for dinner|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so they must take this -2 to gain|pg||
nt|atabey: mixlerde çok iyi derecelerimiz vardý zaten. salvo-merih 6. vera-orhan 7. en iyisi ahu israilli o zamanki partneriyle 3. olmuþtu. tekrar tebrikler tuna namýk|pg||
nt|sengulerz: evet Dekkers'in pasýný hiç anlamadým.. bence diðer alternatif 3NT gömmek olabilirdi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: serap 13 ile davete pas geçti. genellikle ortakta ya 12 varsa 25 ile 3nt oynamamýþ olmayalým diye 3nt denir|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: a clear duck! If declarer has @hAjxxx why not finess?|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the OR made a helptry thru a 3dmnds,here more logical,end result,same.Diff 2 bid|pg||
nt|xenya: what's going on here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S on a moysian fit is unexpected|pg||
nt|psyck: S got herself worried of the @d unneccesarily|pg||
nt|geot: Hm...........as ex-Norwegian I am not to happy about this auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C on a moysian is crazy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now -1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6 diamond tricks |pg||
nt|MolvaM: better claim next :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it is, this play only makes sense if south has heart ace|pg||
nt|geot: 25 HCPs and two balanced hands, seems to "clever" to do something like this|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like 3N would have come home with say a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|atabey: bir seviye yukarý çýkarttýlar ama hala sorunsuz gibi 3@d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jameslee 2: bad luck to see 11 and not make them |pg||
nt|MolvaM: well. declarer is a fighter obviously |pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: imps back to the coffee drinkers i fancy:)|pg||

nt|patricck: best not to cover|pg||
nt|suketbombi: normaly u lead doubleton to get ruff here it is to shorten the big hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbgood: perhaps N might have tried 3@s over 3 @h?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I think he will claim now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: yes jack was a mistake|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad luck for declarer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jameslee 2: thats it |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he is the one that can see them not the others |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now -2 for 3 IMPÂ´s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - if he tries to make it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bildiðim kadarý ile takýmýmýz 4 kiþi oynuyor. yani þu an masadaki ekip hafta baþýndan bu yana sürekli masada|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This would be wrong with 3 @C together with 4 @D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade 10 prevent declarer from squeezing East|pg||
pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: really no chance to find the extra trick esp against fredin fallenius|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: one off for push now |pg||
pc|c9|nt|jameslee 2: other room 5@C -1|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 x 16 in the finals on Wednesday|pg||
nt|patricck: pitch a @C from dummy might be best|pg||
nt|patricck: 28 board matches are of course cutthroat, the best team often wins but the match is short enough to give the underdog a fighting chance|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he is likely to ruff  and play the @CT|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff, take @SA and play @C and West is ensplayed|pg||
nt|pelu: bridge is so easy when u see all 52 cards :)|pg||
nt|patricck: We've been seeing the same cards for quite a while now.........   hopefully we will see some action soon|pg||
nt|psyck: likely no more tricks in @c than in NT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: what are the best chances? enter dummy on @sA and play a small @h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: small heart from hand trick 2 looks fine|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cenglund:  Mahaffey may discard a spade and then declarer will prevail|pg||
nt|hajru:  The NS teamname is wrong, this is the dutch women's team, not the US Joel team|pg||
pc|dA|nt|alok_daga: clubs,33,hrts 33,Spade K inside ,nv brd not wrth the risk|pg||

nt|hawe45:  No push any longer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: @C finesse and @H finesse|pg||
nt|ady: re hi all   got disconnected|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not missed much - declarer edging his way towards his contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West has a weak-2 - and East will keep the @HÂ´s|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yusufb: 5 imp yolda gibi|pg||
pc|d6|nt|MolvaM: diðer masa batmýþ süper|pg||

nt|xenya: but expertly played by N|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rmb1: More effective auction in OR|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up the hearts   but clubs blocked  so will hav e to lose 1 more|pg||
nt|jbgood: 11 for at push|pg||
nt|patricck: A@S and Q@S is good enough to make|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet bende 4 kiþi biliyorum ama bir maçýn line up da yabancý bir isim vardý onu anlamadým muhtemel bir yanlýþlýk|pg||
nt|sengulerz: belki de iyi 12 ile zon söyleyip 11-12 eksi ile davet ediyorlardýr|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jameslee 2: 5@C =|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: now its East who is endplayed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes |pg||
nt|patricck: well, a small diamond lead declarer needs to finesse the 9, tricky|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N in other room should come home if dec plays for @s 33 with 3@s, 1@h, 2@d, 3@c|pg||
nt|xenya: now another trump |pg||
nt|atabey: bu kýzlara ne desek az. inanýlmaz biþey baþardýlar. þunu da atlatalým da|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þu an ilk hedef bu devreyi berabere bitirmek|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4 kiþi oynamak ve her maçýn son borda kadar heyacanýn sürmesi |pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 imp|pg||
nt|atabey: taktik olarak herþeyi göndermek lazým bence bu devre. rakip herþeyi zon oynýcak. en kötü egale olur|pg||

nt|sengulerz: hosbulduk.. Mrb arkadaþlar|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  You could not imagine that he scored a trick in a side suit missing KQJ10|pg||
nt|pelu: a very nice board|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kirp:  Precision @C by W|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S can make 3@h and E/W can make 3@d, but need accurate play to make 3@H I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed mike -straightforward bd|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, 3N did not make after all|pg||
mb|d|nt|fann4: The OR (Open Room) in 4@S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easy game with @S Queen well placed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kirp:  3@H looks ambitious on 43|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@d was suction|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @H or @s and @c|pg||
nt|rmb1: According to their card, South could open 1NT,  not sure why he didn't|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and perhaps a share in the complimentary drink -p&p to the UK is the bore though:(|pg||
nt|bobholl: how to bid 6@C |pg||
nt|blum1956: another wild board|pg||
nt|hajru:  This looks like a Roland 7@c|pg||
nt|hajru:  2@c is either a relay or a natural suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oosmanb: 3@D probably for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@h might be tricky|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 17 facing 14,a slam for the taking as cards fit.Doubt whether it will be bid|pg||
nt|fann4: E made a try and then stopped (he was facing a weak NT opening)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes kibs, the defence was a bit less than perfect|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: this 2@D is a new species, at least for me|pg||
nt|kirp:  curious to see how high EW get now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nobody will agree - but life is fantastic. if you open he North hand with 1 @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well i have seen worse only one finesse a very good irish grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Similar situation now - not easy for E to drive to slam, though he has 7 controls, a doubleton and some good @D|pg||
nt|psyck: declarer played @h too early, before setting up @c's|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: 2@s on the way to 3@d?|pg||
nt|ady: bad diamond split may beat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt!?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other table meck made the 2@H with the sing 8@C lead |pg||
nt|roswolf: still 3 imps to the italians|pg||
nt|atabey: uyardýlar. ahu zobunun viktor aranovla da 2.liði var. onu da ekleyelim|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Might do without finesse - East could have the bare King...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: but here bidding to finishe |pg||
nt|cenglund:  Multi is a dangerous gadget - for both sides|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S: I confirm my 5-card-suit...|pg||
nt|pelu: a veru poor opening, can NS stop in time?|pg||
nt|patricck: might be a thin opening, but it would have been a chunky pass :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: agree peter|pg||
nt|pelu: Qx 2x are not good vcalues|pg||
nt|bobholl: let them reach 6@C first which is difficult after this start|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so when 5 is played is the k singleton with e or what|pg||
nt|atabey: piki doðru taraftan dediler. dilek nie 2@s demedi anlamadým ama|pg||
nt|yusufb: artýk kýrmýzý beyaz pozisyonda herkes cevap veriyor puana bakmazsýzýn|pg||
nt|sengulerz: doðru taraftan oynamak için:)|pg||
nt|atabey: tedirginlik var galiba. 4@s de demedi|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  E showed 5-7 hcp, so no strain on raise to 3@D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this just needs @C Ace onside, (or Ax @S?)|pg||
nt|alok_daga: wud rank F&N as 1 of the best in business they not having a gud day in office|pg||
nt|pelu: and the opening suit not better|pg||
nt|mamos: cards lie very friendly for Spades|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe there was no agreement as to its meaning. was it negative x? or just some values?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so apparently 3H confirms 5-5 but can still be min hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kibitser: It looks like a T/O, but Fredin LOVES penalty doubles|pg||
nt|yusufb: antalyada|pg||
nt|atabey: evet|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rmb1: Loose one @D and ruff one, could be just one @D loser|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may lose to the king and ruff one - that would give 10|pg||
nt|ady: yes    will have to take care|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks certain|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume the 1@S bid denied 4@H|pg||
nt|fann4: Only 11 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the nt game playing IMPS is ridiculous|pg||
nt|patricck: sure, but the 10@D is a useful filler, I am not saying it is a clear opening, just that it is close to the borderline|pg||
nt|roswolf: alet off for norway|pg||
nt|yusufb: x der|pg||
nt|sengulerz: ama 2'liydi o.. bunlarýnki apayrý.. takým þampiyonasý|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: sry Robin - not a deliberate copy:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this auction is very restrained|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done by jet 4@S now ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: indded, N managed to describe his hand at a low level|pg||
nt|blum1956: Simons missed the @s cue|pg||
nt|blum1956: Pasman may pass now|pg||
nt|bobholl: will pass i fear :(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doubt it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: my money is on 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: wanna bet :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  Not always true that 3 losers is 10 winners|pg||
nt|MolvaM: cullin has exact cards that upmark was looking for|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no wasted points|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4 pik dense yapýlabilir miydi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: artýk 2ye 4e bakmamak lazým :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jameslee 2: now hw has confirm the 5@C also :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - at the 3-level...|pg||
nt|blum1956: But Simons missed the @h cue as well so she may have the @c AK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why didÂ´nt South bid 4 @S and not 5 @C???|pg||
nt|sengulerz: Doðu tarafýndan olurdu|pg||
nt|atabey: 4@s olabilir ama 5@d oluyo galiba|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos:  So Diamonds are 3-3 and soon declarer wil smile|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that the odds are on north only having 3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a bad miss i owe you a pint|pg||
nt|bobholl: not glad :(|pg||
pc|h3|nt|STRIK3R: will find the A of @c and @s after 1@d, since 1@h was a freely bid|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks very good for NS, all games down and lots of values|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could well hold @cKJ and @dQ  :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks on any lead, so a nice stop|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer does have entry problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i fancy this making|pg||
nt|MolvaM: acaba dilek 2 pik diyebilseydi kuzey 3@d diyebilir miydi?|pg||
nt|sengulerz: çok zor.. demezdi sanýrým|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jameslee 2: not and easy spot to make 9 lets she what can happend |pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: no problem in opening on 11, but u sh have a good suit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|bobholl: will play A@C now|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|oosmanb: actually maybe it also needs A@S onside or @D 2-2, so you can get to 2nd @c trick|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h bilemezse batar|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: looks to bwe going about it the right way|pg||
nt|mamos: or communication problems is a better way of expressing it|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9@C coming back |pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: should overtake and play a spade|pg||
pc|d3|nt|suketbombi: agree also the number of Cards in Major are relevant when u open light|pg||
nt|patricck: I would agree it would be a horrible opening if the @D were J7532, but with J10852 I would not condemn my partner if they chose to open|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: j@D can come from N |pg||

mb|3C|an| |nt|danilo1: should avoid pressure of being behind (and simple 2@H)|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit thin @H but if she can live with it i can |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: presume this is multi and E decided she liked her hand|pg||
mb|3D!|an|relay|mb|p|nt|tweety1: 2nt was from the score I guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: you really can't ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: more trouble|pg||
nt|danilo1: rather believe as result of actual score|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|murat: exactly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lordy where is this going|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 what|pg||
nt|bobholl: to at least 2 down in 4@H or 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c showing the @h suit & 3@s the shortness i suppose|pg||
nt|tweety1: they r testing @d stop i feel|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: it is not easy to play kowing U are trailing by 40 ... and no swingy boards are coming |pg||
nt|tweety1: @d lead automatic|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tweety1: ah  E playing|pg||
nt|murat: 3@h in CR|pg||
nt|psyck: not that she wants to play it|pg||
nt|bobholl: now may be only 1 down but guess 2 anyway|pg||
pc|h3|nt|murat: ducking may cause some trouble now|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|danilo1: declarer must play low to avoid 2 @H looser (as wee see) ... may not be her point of view ,,,|pg||
nt|tweety1: cant see a reason to duck|pg||
nt|bobh1: now they have to cash the @Ds|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|bobh1: which seems easy|pg||
nt|danilo1: even if she does, Lale has automatic @DK play|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tweety1: one more @d|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Meckwell had a disaster in the OR|pg||
nt|fann4: Alok, I think your criticism is a bit strong - East knows they have 29-31 points between, so how risky is 3NT? I'd say virtually not at all.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
nt|mamos: so anothe rpush|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@d makes thanks to 2 kings being well placed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats a good start 2 slams|pg||
nt|blum1956: one more slam for the NS|pg||
nt|hajru:  I don't think that it ever became clear to south that N was that strong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu arada genel bilgi: kuzeyde oturan marion michielsen 2009 da istanbulda yapýlan dünya gençler þampiyonasýnda açýk 2liyi kazanarak dünya gençler þamp ünvaný kazandý|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama aradan 2 sene geçti. haliyle epey yaþlandý o da :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: 2 @S was already showing reverse values i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Easy defense against 6 @D |pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of points but not enough for a slam|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|STRIK3R: can make 3NT as the cards lay|pg||
nt|oosmanb: no stopping now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if guessing right in @h's|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@H   but fortunate |pg||
nt|MolvaM: probably wont be bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats my view too|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But South had A-10 for the suit bid several times by partner|pg||
nt|atabey: çocuklarý mý atmýþlar bizimkilerin önüne. kaybetmeyi kabullenmiþler iyi|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Can make 4@H if there is only 1 @H loser|pg||
nt|psyck: more or less on a finesse, likely will be bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: pass by west seems conservative|pg||
nt|atabey: ben serapýn yerinde olsam bi td de ben çaðýrýrým. abuk sabuk itiraz ediyolar die|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: hardly recommended but brown would have done well to balance with double|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, IIRC, 2@d is any minimum, 2@s implies extras.  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: could get c suit wrong here|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes she should have bid 4@S iso 5@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @S (cue) was, what we call tax-free|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will hav e to drop honor doubleton heart in north hand   and bring in 5 club tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: X from East?  4@C seems too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: @S partial|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean: 6 @S|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the fact that the spade suit does not cum into the frame,I found objectionable|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  14-16 hcp, 3@C is simple Stayman|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Yes, because there is not way of pitching the losing diamonds|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@C = singleton @C not in the goos spot for N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @H...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Meck hates to bid bad slams, but he did not follow his principle on this one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very dificult not to bid 6@H here |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cue-bids might be invented these days|pg||
nt|cenglund:  RKCB is not the answer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but on info controls could be a good stop from N-S lets see |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South has bad values in the side-suits|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he could bid it directly or not |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: long think |pg||
nt|cenglund:  I suppose 3C shows minimum|pg||
nt|fann4: Slam is on here for NS, but the @SKQx opposite shortage looks wasted to South.|pg||
nt|fann4: This can go for 800 in 4@Sx|pg||
nt|fann4: Note E did not enter the auction in the OR|pg||
nt|alok_daga: but AQ10xx,shud appeal when partner splinters|pg||
nt|fann4: NS are clearly in a forcing situation, so S may pass.|pg||
nt|fann4: In which case N will likely press on.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Pass?his strength yet undisclosed|pg||
nt|fann4: S hates @SKQx for offense, but dbl may be a little premature|pg||
nt|fann4: Alok, 3@S is a splinter, forcing to game.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1hrt may be 6,he has 14|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Hi|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi and welcome Pekka|pg||
nt|patricck: should be a flat board|pg||
nt|hajru:  but I think north's bidding would also have been consistent with, say, an 11 count with only 6@c|pg||
nt|bobholl: have to find @C Q may be in 6@H|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now it is Pasman's turn to bid a spade cue after Simons introduces hearts|pg||
nt|bobholl: they play reverse lebensohl i guess so 3@H forcing now|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, 2N is artificial 8+|pg||
nt|hajru:  For insiders: as described by Erik Kirchhoff in IMP a year or two ago|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks like she is not sure|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seyircilerimiz düþünme konusunda kural nedir onu soruyorlar. bu konuda yorumcularýmýz ne açýklama yapabilir|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Dbl =?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: flat board here 1@H & 2@CS to loose|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C would make on a good day|pg||
nt|psyck: 4333 & max 32 hcp, so E took the low road|pg||
nt|roswolf: but no enterprise from the italians|pg||
nt|MolvaM: böylece herkes oyun esnasýnda düþünme veya duraklama konusunda bilgi alýr|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  This was the solution - now 4 @H and thatÂ´s it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Now he cant cue bid 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If he does, he might make the slam...!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: let,s see if S can help N to bid the good contract |pg||
nt|pelu: the runnings scores are yet not running, but I am sure that the polish IT-staff is working hard|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@d either weak @d or 20+ art|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now what|pg||
nt|bobholl: it's over now i fear :(|pg||
nt|hajru:  NS convention card at: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/WomensTeams/netherlands/Pasman-Simons.pdf|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably one more slam missed|pg||
nt|funtay: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ öbür odayi burdan ayni anda izlemek isteyenler için|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: so North shows balanced hand|pg||
nt|atabey: gereksiz düþünmek faul tabi ama zaferin dediði gibi oturmayý falan düþünmüþ olabilir. yorgunluk|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbgood: stole it|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club switch now|pg||
nt|mamos: South squeezed out of auction|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Provided that 4C was not a query of some kind|pg||
nt|bagman: If memory servers; greco hampson play meckwell type precision where North was limited|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could be getting serious|pg||
nt|blum1956: there is time to recover - 44 more boards|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is luckily not obvious to find @C Q|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. Either a @d lead or continue with @s|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @c lead ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not easy to pick that contract|pg||
nt|MolvaM: michielsen http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=13939|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kirp:  3N is fairly lucky to make, 3@C could be 5 CMS looking at 3@S bid to show 4@Hs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can he play on @C instead of @H ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  W showed @S if any 4 crd major, so @S lead is not best usually|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cenglund:  They are heading for same destination|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there they go to 6@H|pg||
nt|pelu: there could come 11 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|hajru:  NS has been playing at this level for at least 30 years, 1 or 2 bad boards to start is not going to affect them|pg||
nt|sengulerz: defans 4 tur @d oynayarak batýrabiliyor|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kirp:  may play on @Hs |pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hate to - but have to! - syt it: POOR BIDDING AT BOTH TABLES|pg||
nt|hawe45:  say it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I don't think that this slam is unavoidable|pg||
nt|pelu: no more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: turnuvalarda hakemlerin ve apel komitelerinin en baþýný aðrýtan konulardan birisi düþüðnme ve duraklama durumlarý|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: i want to bid|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this is what happened!|pg||
nt|atabey: bunda biþey yoktu bence. direk çamur yaptý kuzeydeki|pg||
nt|sengulerz: aksi takdirde sadece 1 @h vererek yapabiliriz kontratý|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kirp:  small @H best now, but @D finesse works|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: considering his middelcards in @c, playing one round on @h's was more attempting, needed to try @c's if first @h failed?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Team Angelini picked up more imps in board 2 when the other room bid 3NT instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|kirp:  ad hope NY couldn't take 3@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: a fair punt, but didnt work out|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes, I guess J@H onside is higher %age than @C 3-3? |pg||
nt|kirp:  3@S lead certainly gave defense little chance to figure out what to do|pg||
nt|kirp:  if @H J is onside, then has time to test @Cs and if not 33, then @Ds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D finesse|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt he need @d finesse in any case? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  They are "buried" in their conventions!|pg||
nt|mamos: 2Nt will be "less bad " than 3@c I think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sengulerz: batsalar bile toplam 17 puanla @d fitini bulmalarý bizim için kötü tabii|pg||
nt|MolvaM: serap burada belli belirsiz düþünmüþ bile olsa birþey çýkmaz. burada kullanýlan terim: masada tempoyu aksatacak kadar duraksama|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes, I think they play a lot of Meckwell stuff.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 tricks look the max|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ayrýca diðer masada oynayan vriends ve arnold çifti ise geçen hafta mixed takýmlar þampiyonasýný kazandýlar|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cenglund:  Both N-S pairs thought that it's a big minus|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sengulerz: öbür tarafta 4@se býrakýlabilir|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: needed to safety play diamonds to win|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: likely not much difference here since NS on for 4@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  still only 8 trix with J@H onside|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to get 3@d tricks, so @d finesse is very much needed|pg||
nt|kirp:  S should have continued @Hs ,then needed @D finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  Might make 120 = 8 IMPÂ´s|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jameslee 2: we,ll after all (no score)  we shall keep 12-12|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tabii ki her biri erkek partner ile oynamak sureti ile|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: now has to drop doubleton A@S eith east    play towards K@S    then drop ace 2nd round|pg||
nt|jbgood: still 1 down may be cheap|pg||
nt|sengulerz: bravo Dilek.. hiç polemik yaratmadý kart oyunuyla|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kirp:  another pickup for EW, as they played 1N in OR|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A pleasent surprise is waiting for them|pg||
nt|psyck: tuf to find minor 44 fit after 2N opening & 6NT is not a good slam unlike 6@c, so sensible by E to not try I suppose|pg||
nt|yusufb: kazanmadýlar 2 oldular |pg||
nt|hobakan: +1 oldu da gitti maþallah.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: o evet pardon 2. ler|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oosmanb: Full 10 imps on offering here|pg||
nt|blum1956: The @cQ is with East as one should expect. In fact South has enough time to ruff out the diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kirp:  duck this to set up count for end position|pg||
nt|atabey: 4@s de batar. trefli nasýl saðlýycak|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: but still down 1|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Greco had a problem,5hrts I found the least of all evils|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  North needes the @H-finesse earlier - now trouble with @S back|pg||
nt|hawe45:  needed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rmb1: Exit in @C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: North's rdbl invited South to bid  having passed already maybe he should  but perhaps feared Spades in West|pg||

nt|fann4: There is no 8th trick - he will lose 3@C tricks.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: evet sürekli üstten konuþunca arada da kazançlý el denk getirecekler. ama onu bile hemen hemen egale edebilmek iyi|pg||

pc|h2|nt|jameslee 2: not much comunication for the 2 @S finesse required |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C play could duck by S |pg||
nt|bagman: East needs to play a spade in some point to prevent @S-@D strip squeeze; if the defense cashes their 4 tricks and fail to play a spade, W is strip squeezed|pg||
nt|fann4: And easy to see - losing 1 trump, 1@S, 3@C and @DK|pg||

nt|MolvaM: this match is 28 boards total. the winning team proceeds to the quarter finals|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bagman: Having cashed the spade, the defense should take the clubs and lock declarer to his hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North MUST have @H Ace - otherwise 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sengulerz: mrb Cengiz|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jameslee 2: what can E play for now ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Kx@S ?|pg||

pc|c4|nt|cenglund:  Excellent score for the team Apteker|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: this is Bridge when one has a few options can go rong :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both of them (East and West) might have bid better. East has no hand for NT-play, and West never showed the 6th @S|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They bid the more sensible 4S in the OR making|pg||
nt|fann4: The defence would have to mess this up really badly to end play themselves.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bad cardplay error from north|pg||

mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  Suppose West opens 1 @H - would 5 @D be the bid?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The level of bridge seen so far has been rather poor and not what we had expected|pg||

nt|alok_daga: now the excitement starts with a unnatural 2hrts|pg||

nt|fann4: 2@H wasn't unnatural - it was a weak 2.|pg||
nt|hajru:  OK, we'll manage|pg||

nt|pelu: but again easy for us|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes    the hand belongs to e/w    but 9 tricks the limit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: fredin needs to locate the heart shortage to bid the slam with confidence|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the open room bidding was a bit of a gamble. but successful nevertheless|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2nt?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|STRIK3R: 8@hs I would say, x from east should show 4@h?|pg||
nt|kirp:  2N is some form of Lebensohl, compete in a minor|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yes seems like it|pg||
nt|sengulerz: egale bir 4@h eli olarak geçse bu el|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  but not as clear in this sequence|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult call here|pg||
nt|mamos: East's hand seems enormous for this treatment but what do I know|pg||
nt|roswolf: mild slam try showing short spades no doubt|pg||
nt|hobakan: 3@d - 3 NT der heralde|pg||
nt|sengulerz: 3NT olmuþ ama 5@d daha iyi kontrat|pg||
nt|hobakan: 5 tane de verebilirmiþ @c|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: lead critical|pg||
nt|ady: n/s well overboard|pg||
nt|psyck: S making a slam try showing the @h suit & @s shortness, N will signoff with balanced minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: no diamond lead makes south huge favorite to hold spade queen|pg||

nt|MolvaM: kör empasý için karo asa gider mi yoksa körü açýktan vermeyi mi tercih eder?|pg||
nt|arigun: 3nt problemsiz ama 4@h de sorun cikabilir (gerci @d dagilimi disarda cok uygun onda da problem yok), dekleran firesiz @s atagindan sonra dekleranin yanlis oynamasi heran isleri ...|pg||
nt|arigun: karistirabilir|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h acýktan vermez|pg||
nt|sengulerz: @s sayýsýný doðru anlamaya baðlý.. 4-4 diye düþünürse açýktan @h verip @c den çift empas yapmaya çalýþýr|pg||
nt|funtay: 5imp daha|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt o kadar da problemsiz deðil bence. @dA asa giderse kör empas tutmadý mý batacaðý kesin gibi|pg||
nt|sengulerz: 5-3 se yere geçip @h empasý yapmasý lazým|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Its only -1 |pg||
nt|roswolf: and a club switch to follow|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: spec gives me a 6@D cool contract comment |pg||
nt|bagman: In the 2nd position the preempt should be quite pure as there's sort of 50-50 chance that the good cards are held by the partner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now slam looks easy. just blackwood|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi peter :) welcome|pg||
nt|desert: Hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The poorest 18-count, IÂ´ve seen for weeks|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|suketbombi: yes unless defence opens up @DS|pg||
nt|pelu: down 1 as long as NS dont play @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: north co-operates - this auction needs to slow down|pg||
nt|sengulerz: tabii rakip renk @s olunca kimse @ce falan bakmýyo haliyle|pg||
mc|9|nt|ady: 200 to Netherlands    could only make 140     east with defensive values  might have doubled 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And with 400 in 5 @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - East ducks the first @C for sure|pg||
nt|fann4: So 10 imps probably to DEN|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4h alert means?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: cuebid? or something else?|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: Again EW might try 4@S|pg||
nt|fann4: But I far preferred the pass made at the other table.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psyck: looks like 3N down on @s lead here, if it can be found|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is solid even though i suspect an upgrade from north|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: slam is on the @c finesse, which doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: you have 7 solid tricks and pd opens. time to think about a slam :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Any endplays possible for 10th trick in 4@H? |pg||
nt|mamos: there could be blood spilt here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1nt is?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oosmanb: I doubt it, so NS would do well to stop below game|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C was 16+ artificial|pg||
nt|fann4: Wow - a disaster for EW in the CR, ending up in 4@H in a 5-1 fit.|pg||
nt|geot: Only the mentioned spade lead is a problem|pg||
nt|hajru:  Sorry, phone rang, I was about to say that NS play 2NT as 18-19 and forcing, that creates a lot of clarity in other auctions and they accept that they occasionally end up in a poor 3N with 18 opposite 6, as on the last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 61% for NS on board 6, nobody made 3@C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but with a 10 card fit, vulnerable, can Fjaelberg put the brakes on |pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H can make if W does not switch to @S when in with the A@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|oosmanb: How? even if @C are stripped East has 4th @d to exit?|pg||
nt|kirp:  8@S|pg||
nt|patricck: more than 1% chance for a misdefence because it could be the opening lead that gives it away. After that has been survived very unlikely the defence will slip,|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will now power home|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, likely an upgrade with a decent 6 carder|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Ah right, |pg||
nt|jbgood: guess X shows 4-5+ spades?|pg||
nt|ady: down 1  would sedem unless a slip|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1C-P-1H = S so I guess this X is a transfer to S as well|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 4@h now|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A less interesting board |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Overtrick is easy: 2 x @H - and a SMALL @D|pg||
nt|xenya: the 1N opening seems to have worked well here|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Forcing and 2D transfer - I'd suggest|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bus doÂ´nt worry NL, they play 3 x 16|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 or J ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oosmanb: Well spotted Martin|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: S could never hope to buy the contract in @hs - so perhaps xx in stead of 2 @h to indicate a high @h honor might have worked better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  That's what happened in the OR|pg||
nt|MolvaM: turnuva sonuna kadar yani 25 tane filan daha bu tür eller gelse  :)|pg||
nt|sengulerz: tam ben yazýyodum onu:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oosmanb: So yes important for West to break up endplay, and he will too, has 1@S bid to help him|pg||
nt|kirp:  I said 'can make', timing and defense needed to help|pg||
nt|MolvaM: www.bbotv.com/vugraph/|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: E knows that W has short hearts and might even hope a heart lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kibs tell me:  1NT= 5+ ZZ-points with 5+@H. (A=3 ZZ, K=2 ZZ, Q=1 ZZ)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok thanks monika :) you are doing great|pg||
nt|yusufb: hayat bayram olsa insanlar elele tutuþsa:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: Assume pp 1sp p 2nt=4trumps+a stiff.AKx treated as a 4card in the OR|pg||
nt|fann4: In my book, the W hand is just a 2@S raise over 1@S|pg||
nt|bagman: Here declarer can cash the @HA and cross ruff 8 additional trump tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fann4: Can one make 10 tricks on the layout?|pg||
nt|bagman: GIB can but E's going to cash his easy 9 :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes|pg||
nt|psyck: W got his @s's into the bidding other room, so a swing likely|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The overcall = very good for declarer|pg||
nt|atabey: el geldikçe puan alýyoruz. bence 100 olsun da son devreyi oynamasýnlar |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  South can see 23 HCP - so not much for an entry in North|pg||
nt|pelu: now running score is up : http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or32runda1.html|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 3C probably a good hand and breaking the t/f - tempting for  West now I'd suggest.|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Page 558 of the system or just filed under 'Z'?|pg||
nt|atabey: buda bitti. 9 el kaldý zafer|pg||

nt|xenya: suppose N opens 1@C, 1@D from S -- and W overcalls 11S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like zz points have much popularity in sweden|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet týlsým bozulmasa|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kirp:  I would guess it unlikely to make, knowing EW is very sound on all aspects of game|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S*|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes that helps a lot :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - only easy after this so-called overcall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean, we are NOT allowed to comment on the 1 @H-bid...|pg||
nt|bobholl: we can they have to listen :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: still there are entry problems|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If North has given count, no sense for a small @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: looking for  an imposible @H ruff underlead from AK@D |pg||
nt|hawe45:  ??? Shall these two teams play in the next round (18.30...)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: still Q@D on the other side E no more @H can ruff Hi |pg||
nt|suketbombi: dummy is a real dummy here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|STRIK3R: what line is the best from norths point of view?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should we say it this way: West was MINIMUM for his 2 @H...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well as I said. I cant blame them.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|vugraphpl7: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
nt|psyck: it was not too late for @s shift after winning @c either|pg||
nt|psyck: as has @hA entrtyto play @s again|pg||
nt|geot: And why should East find that? The bidding worked find for N/S.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þimdi kör gelse tref pasýný bilemez|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it is on a finesse and 50% is not bad for a warm summer afternoon|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oosmanb: Draw @Hs, K@D ruff a @D, and @c up?|pg||
nt|kirp:  good nes and bad news, finesse works, 30 trumps is bad|pg||
nt|mamos: East probably pleased he didnt have to play this hand :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: fortunately for the declarer diamond suit is "frozen" with the defenders|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: e/w do well in hearts and could make 10 tricks if clubs not played early|pg||
nt|jbgood: much easier to defent if N knows about the heart king with prd |pg||
pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: has to try the finesse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no better chance|pg||
nt|MolvaM: artýk bilir|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: non spade lead was a disaster for EW here, but can salvage with heart return knocking out north entry|pg||
nt|atabey: dýþardan izlemek daha zor dimi|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  By playin the @H-suit correctly, West will save 300 - from the 1400|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: well done|pg||
nt|ppiglett: good switch. There was I trying to work out the squeeze oppotunities - I stop now!|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: other table playing fast playing the last hand |pg||
nt|fann4: 3@D looks pretty flat|pg||
nt|psyck: but W did clearly ask for @s on the @c's|pg||
nt|roswolf: a lot of mistakes in this match - makes for a rollercoaster ride|pg||
nt|geot: to late with the heart lead, declarer can set up 2 hearts and a total of nine|pg||
nt|roswolf: here a pretty fair slam |pg||
nt|psyck: he could, but he chose to play @c 1st for some reason, a Grosvenor :)|pg||
nt|geot: what is best here, 6D or 6H|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry my knowledge of turkish isn't great :)|pg||
nt|sengulerz: evet.. ama iþler iyi gidince seyretmek de fena olmuyomuþ|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mamos: 4 of a major here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: after second club ducked north almost certainly should unblock diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So half of the teams play next round|pg||
nt|bagman: Even though the hearts are blocked there are only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|psyck: These Grosvenor Coups can really demoralize opps, but not these EW here I'm sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 1@d from south 4+@h|pg||
nt|rmb1: So much different seeing all four hands.  But North does not know about West's clubs or @HK in South|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  makes    just lose 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is how they open a bal strongish hand|pg||

nt|mamos: +1240|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jbgood: transfer?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@H might be a transfer or smolen (5+S - 4 H)|pg||
nt|psyck: @h better I think, you can try various lines in @d depending on how it goes if @h were trump|pg||
nt|arigun: bu biraz pahali olacak|pg||

nt|MolvaM: düþünüyorum o halde 5 derim |pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: I would not think of Smolen with 6 @s:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Just trying to get North to declare spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: but surely looks like it|pg||
nt|bagman: W has nothing to add here even though he can see that diamonds are likely to run|pg||
nt|yusufb: mecbur kalýnca soylenebilir ama naturel deklere varken niye boyle seyler yapoýlýki?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  And NS are about to miss their 3rd slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: another slam missed :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: One more slam to miss))|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: I thought East may double 4M based on West's earlier double.  But he has a different view of the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: East discarded a @d, and Nunes ruffed the 4th @D good|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: west thinking of attacking @c's?|pg||
nt|jbgood: is this true?|pg||
nt|rmb1: He may double 5M :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: and North is thinking ... ?|pg||
nt|jbgood: firs willing to play 4@h then 5 @s? Where is dicipline? (but N might have bid 3 NT with his double club stopper|pg||
nt|geot: the 18-20 2@D opening which will likely lead them to slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bid by Simons|pg||
nt|blum1956: This time they will bid it|pg||
nt|bobholl: she already bid 2nt on 19 |pg||
nt|hawe45:  North might have bid 4 @H over 3 NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: or 4@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IsÂ´nt 5 @S just asking suit-quality - then whatÂ´s the problem?|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess this asks for good @S she has them !!|pg||
nt|blum1956: From Pasman's point of view Simons should have the Ace and two kings|pg||
nt|hajru:  For starters, she has opened 2NT on a 19 count|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Then give her the @D JACK!!!|pg||
nt|blum1956: But if the king is in clubs not in hearts the slam will not be a laydown|pg||
nt|yusufb: 5@h de batmaz ama 5@d cok batar|pg||
pc|hK|nt|MolvaM: the problem with suppX is that pd may correct to spades with 5 card poor spade suit|pg||
nt|yusufb: yapýlýrki|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ilginç 1 kontrat bu|pg||
nt|arigun: 3nt sansli @h bilinirse ki deklerasyondan mumkun south'da KQ@s gorundukten sonra, ama deklere etmesi zor|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|jbgood: No double:)|pg||

nt|ady: very good score for Netherlands  even undoubled|pg||
pc|dA|nt|alok_daga: follow F&N on a regular basis.Dont recollect when they last had such a disastrous set|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense has 3 hearts and a club; declarer can ruff his 3rd club in dummy|pg||
nt|fann4: Claiming time in one second.|pg||
nt|fann4: At this stage it is 19-11 to DEN in vps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and it is almost impossible to find a reasonable line that fails on this layout|pg||
nt|arigun: 4@h icin de ayni durum|pg||

nt|geot: but Lavazza up by 8 now. |pg||
nt|roswolf: well with all these errors they have a good chance even though behind at the moment|pg||
nt|geot: Exciting match|pg||
nt|xenya: how many times has the lead changed hands -- i seem to have lost count|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Some unblocking in @S might have given the extra trick|pg||
nt|hajru:  I guess NS will see that hand back in one of the upcoming trainng sessions|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only @H-lead kills 6 @D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: but self inflicted and well deserved|pg||
nt|roswolf: 96 imps in 23 bds is a lot|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the other room W did not value his 55 well enough to go further|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bagman: S probably showed AK bare by leading the @HK; on the @HK, N should signal as to normal Kx lead; when the @HA reveals the position, N should show suit preference how to get in|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT play wrong way up|pg||

mb|3C|nt|bagman: Facing a limited opening, Greco can pass|pg||

nt|fann4: A sensible auction in the OR|pg||
nt|bagman: They also play limited openings, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3NT denies outside A/K - but can be 2Q :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: even on a low club lead it is impossible to go right|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: for a 11 flat score |pg||
nt|fann4: I'm not at all convinced about passing the S hand.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 2spades with hrt,5 3 enterprising|pg||
nt|bagman: If 3@H showed a minimum, E has nothing to add|pg||
nt|MolvaM: here the bidding was more normal|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 2D - constructive raise in H with some defence. East pass for W wil decent defence to 2S. Plusses are available in defence.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can make it if guesses the spade layout|pg||
nt|sengulerz: þöyle düþünün.. bu devrede aldýðýmýz imp leri geri verdik|pg||

pc|h5|nt|oosmanb: yeah|pg||
nt|kirp:  even after a @H switch by S, one duck and S has no more entries|pg||
nt|oosmanb: too many stoppers in @s, no entry for @H, |pg||
nt|kirp:  however there are transport problems|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4 more IMPs to Angelini|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3rd seat 1@H seems like it might disrupt things a bit|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: was almost expecting Olsen to open 2@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I was half expecting a 1@H opening|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not sure if he and Jan open 2@H on 5 card suites|pg||
nt|mamos: 2NT some limit bid I guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|patricck: not a lucky contract, but I agree with Souths bidding|pg||

nt|mamos: maybe not bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þimdi sakin bir kontrat|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jr7: I think they are trying to catch the play they are playing now!|pg||

nt|atabey: serap dummy. geçen elden sonra biraz sakinleþmesi iyi|pg||
nt|yusufb: serapta dummy dinlenir 2-3 dakka:)|pg||

pc|h8|nt|jameslee 2: last board could be a big swing to make the match closer |pg||
nt|fann4: This can easily go 2  down.|pg||
nt|bagman: EW are vulnerable, but I think that this is punishing partner for balancing|pg||
nt|fann4: E did far too much here.|pg||
nt|fann4: And suddenly ANG could pick up 8 or so imps|pg||
nt|alok_daga: &not a bad balance at that.1sp pp 2hrts can be worse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seyirciler 4 kör olduðunu belirtiyorlar|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fann4: Declarer has to guess to play low now for 1 down.|pg||
nt|fann4: I was expecting a trump lead there.|pg||

nt|hajru:  Finally some good news for the dutch: the opps missed slam on 8 as well|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is an automatic @H/@C squeeze against West|pg||

nt|bobholl: rite :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vicky888:  should make now|pg||
nt|bagman: He knows that N has at most 15 and that S passed|pg||

pc|hT|nt|oosmanb: nice play!|pg||
nt|patricck: actually maybe it isn't so bad|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: malinowsku operating again with 3NT bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this time succesfully|pg||
nt|jbgood: an early unblock by N|pg||
nt|patricck: with no entry to the long hearts North could have grabbled the 2nd heart and played on @D|pg||
nt|mamos: Both Ns pairs in this match may be relieved that this is a push|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: don't believe that :)|pg||
nt|hajru:  I don't think you need the squeeze: win, give up a spade|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: SUSPECT ONLY -1|pg||
nt|psyck: true, though they may just double that as cards are here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will play East for the Ace - hoping @C Ace by West maybe|pg||
nt|mamos: Im told 3@c showed minimum|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kirp:  now  some problems for W|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: entry problem in East|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D might have worked better|pg||
nt|kirp:  than K@C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: small @D or AK/?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so far he has seen th @hA and @cQJ in east. so might place @sK with west|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: maybe some back for Aptekar|pg||
nt|MolvaM: konfüçyüz gibi konuþtun cengiz tebrikler|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kirp:  small @D towards J, now W has to hope Q@C dblton|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think there were problems with small @D to J too, then you dont have tempo for @C tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: as south will play another @S, before any @C played|pg||
nt|oosmanb: tricky hand to play|pg||
nt|bagman: N might cash out|pg||
nt|atabey: bitmiþ mi? burda da olmuþtu oyunun ortasýnda|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry i didn't notice there's ruff|pg||
nt|MolvaM: will lose 2 spades anyway. so he must play diamonds for a double finesse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: difficult|pg||
nt|ppiglett: But that doesn't matter. Two spades, two clubs, a heart - the problem is diamonds -if S times the hand and finesses against q-J with E - he makes.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right peter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I think unlikely, but we shall soon see|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yo bu el için|pg||
nt|atabey: bunlar daha yeni bizimkilerin yarýsýna gelmiþ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bagman: He knows that W must hold at least one spade|pg||
nt|fann4: There a number of ways to set this 2 tricks, but N has to be careful.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jameslee 2: 3nt on board 20 can be made to make it a big swing |pg||

nt|roswolf: WELL DONE|pg||
pc|d3|nt|arigun: anca konusuruz :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|xenya: no ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: 4@S also a make e/w|pg||
nt|bagman: Before setting it 2 tricks you have to set it 1 trick first|pg||
nt|fann4: Agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: And if you have the setting trick in hand in a nondoubled vulnerable game, you quite often should cash it|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer needs to take a ruffing finesse in @C to get 8 tricks|pg||
nt|alok_daga: cash hrt Ace play spade |pg||
nt|geot: In the other room N/S was left in 4@H I hear, bad news for the Norwegians|pg||

pc|s8|nt|fann4: So a likely flat or 1imp board - meaning an excellent result for DEN, who are in 6th position in the A Swiss right now.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: GN all|pg||
nt|bagman: the trump lead was quite standard after the auction; with hearts 3-3 the spades go away for push|pg||

mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: michael yuen is one of my friends from vancouver|pg||

nt|hawe45:  @C to the 10 works better|pg||
