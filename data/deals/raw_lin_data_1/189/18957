mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ballebodk: i slow start 7cl/7d :) can they bid that ?|pg||
nt|toral5: hedy has an indepth idea of fantunes methods which will help us understand it more|pg||

nt|toral5: west will take control once @D are matched.2 singletons are super assets|pg||

pc|d5|nt|toral5: for a pair like fantunes 7nt is par|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= 14+ nat or 15+ balanced|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|toral5: was trump q denied?|pg||
nt|ballebodk: maybe they miss DQ - i can be hard to se the 7-3 fit in D !|pg||
nt|toral5: i am sure nunes would be discouraged to bid a grand in a 7-2 fit without the q|pg||
nt|danilo1: he does not see 7-card @D ... West must have full control ... and he need to know @CK ... do not know how in their methods he shouls ask for it |pg||
nt|toral5: kxx with fantoni probably not disclosed|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know what 5@c was, i believe cuebid|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|ballebodk: its normally a little to much poker to bid a slam missing trumf Qxxxx - you will have some good moments but also some bad - so its the best strategi to have trumf Q|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|danilo1: well, no missing slams in this set of boards :) ... next one|pg||
nt|ballebodk: but to be realistic - i dont think that the danish ew can do the job - otherweise i will really kipp with our flag !|pg||
nt|toral5: 3 slams in 4 brds is super|pg||
nt|hedyg: plus 5 teams from the B Swiss|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems a good system..|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: ... and all very good (percentage slams)|pg||
nt|toral5: this 3s will encourage south a lot|pg||
nt|toral5: 3s opp a minimum and south has much more than that|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls can be quite weak, esp by passed hands|pg||
nt|ballebodk: yes KQx in spade infront of shortage - do they play it as void i wonder ?|pg||
nt|toral5: kqx might discourage south|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@S will first not impress South, but when East bids 4@S (probable), he may visualise ruffing finess ... |pg||
nt|hedyg: he has an easy 3NT bid, if Fantoni passes|pg||
nt|toral5: but if 1@D promised @D,south might be encouraged|pg||
mb|3D|nt|danilo1: will Fulvio be on same wave - and not bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|toral5: most likely finesses IF needed will work after 1s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a 4@s bid by E is an invitation to slam for opps|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|hedyg: the man has played before|pg||
nt|ballebodk: i really disagree - 3NT ? - when you have a 9card fit in h - we are not playing pair !|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3NT! - best bid for South .. leave Space - and shows @S values|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it is a modified version of  Ekeblad's  Ultimate Canape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|hedyg: hey 3NT is not final, but it sure describes his hand which is what his pd is asking for|pg||
nt|cenglund:  5D is making, but getting there seems to be a problem|pg||
pc|c7|nt|danilo1: 3NT is not with idea to play there - just to show what he has|pg||
nt|hedyg: as i wrote above, it is not a final bid|pg||
nt|toral5: 3nt can never be good.interchange the minor king and 3nt is dead on a @S lead|pg||
nt|ballebodk: i think that 3nt should show at least 2 stoppers in sp, eg: KQ10x, EKx, and not 1 stopper|pg||
nt|hedyg: Sapan! of course N would never pass 3NT!|pg||
nt|danilo1: to note ... Excellent pass over 3@S by Fulvio|pg||
nt|toral5: why so?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems difficult to modify an ultimate system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of 1@S  as "Kaplan Inversion" ??  Edgar switched the meaning of 1N and 1@S   so 1@S was artificial  like a forcing nt|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|hedyg: on a @s lead in 3NT he makes 12 tricks, on a @c lead only 11|pg||

nt|ballebodk: but to all your specs out there - watch and learn - even the greastest can make severe mistakes so there is still hopes for us normally mortals :) |pg||
