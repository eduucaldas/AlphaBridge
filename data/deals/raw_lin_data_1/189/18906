nt|Walddk2: Running scores at  http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda7.html|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is a slight bias towards the 'other major' for opening leads on this auction. West is unlikely to hold four hearts (or he would have responded 1@H), but he could have four ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: diamonds.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but if opps play standard methods, there is a bias towards the other minor as far as opener's hand goes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: This is the last match in the round-robin. Three teams from each group advance to the Swiss A, starting later today. Winners transfer 3 VPs, runners-up 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: The same is true after 1@D - 1@S - 1NT - 3NT, where responder can hold four clubs but not four hearts. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C then notrumps is often clubs and hearts, less often clubs and diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but here after the artificial 1@C that doesn't apply so much|pg||

nt|ady: thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ady: 4@H looks ok for e/w   but can beaten if defence finds 2 diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D  makes if getting heart right|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 4@s or 5@c playable|pg||

nt|ady: sorry of course 3 losers in diamonds for e/w|pg||

nt|ralfwil: important to finess in @s immediately|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite generous. 3 from 8. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I also said how many VPs they carry forward|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Winners 3, runners-up 1|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|brolucius: The West hand was not strong enough to respond at the two-level for either team.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Not that a 2@D response would have led to any different contract.|pg||
nt|athene: i'm surprised both easts opened 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good effort to make 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: i would expect many to open it 2|pg||
nt|brolucius: A weak 2? Far too strong as I see it.|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Mollo's Walter the Walrus, who spent his life counting points would say '10 points', ah, that's a 6-10 point weak two. But here you have two kings and an ace., and a very good ...|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ady: 4@H  down 2 in open room   11 imps for Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but - at least in teams - declarer should have played @sA and @s10 before the last trumph. a good player can duck @sJ|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: double by north|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kirp:  As predicted!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Hi all|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S play either straight forward 2/1 or transfer after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: N opened 3 @c and E made a nonleaping Michaels 4@d, so 4@h was wrongsided and got a @d lead|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT by South is not bad with spade lead from King|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes @H + @D behave well|pg||
nt|rmb1: Meanwhile South could X or bid NT now|pg||
nt|ady: not wild about 2@S from east|pg||
nt|jbgood: 500 in 2@s x - but that will not happen|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|STRIK3R: you might have seen me playing with Olsen on BBO, his nick is James950|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's actually a regular on BBO |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nowhere else to go?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5@c also good|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is club ace realistic lead|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S North?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|rmb1: 4@H will be more interesting|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 4@h:) at least on a spade lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or duck of heart lead now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: a clear duck! If declarer has @hAjxxx why not finess?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: i think it is, this play only makes sense if south has heart ace|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: perhaps N might have tried 3@s over 3 @h?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: yes jack was a mistake|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: what are the best chances? enter dummy on @sA and play a small @h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: small heart from hand trick 2 looks fine|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|d5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rmb1: @C finesse and @H finesse|pg||

pc|s7|pc|h9|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: see they chose the 4-3 heart fit     looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c5|nt|rmb1: More effective auction in OR|pg||

nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
nt|athene: not that you especially want to rebid 2@C anyway|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not over 1@S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: well, you might have 1435 or so?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you could be 1-4(53)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i was counting 53 as both minors :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Possible to rebid 1NT on those shapes, if in range.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thus you would bid 2@C with either 1=4=5=3 or 1=4=3=5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
nt|athene: M/R are quite strict about 1nt rebid showing 2 in partner's major, aren't they|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Not for them, I dare say, but popular here.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|bigtrain: they promise a doubleton+ support for the major that was responded|pg||

nt|roswolf: meckwell in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kirp:  Precision @C by W|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S can make 3@h and E/W can make 3@d, but need accurate play to make 3@H I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed mike -straightforward bd|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kirp:  3@H looks ambitious on 43|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@d was suction|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @H or @s and @c|pg||
nt|rmb1: According to their card, South could open 1NT,  not sure why he didn't|pg||
mb|1H|nt|oosmanb: 3@D probably for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@h might be tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this 2@D is a new species, at least for me|pg||
nt|kirp:  curious to see how high EW get now|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 2@s on the way to 3@d?|pg||
nt|ady: bad diamond split may beat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt!?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kirp:  E showed 5-7 hcp, so no strain on raise to 3@D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this just needs @C Ace onside, (or Ax @S?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Loose one @D and ruff one, could be just one @D loser|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may lose to the king and ruff one - that would give 10|pg||
nt|ady: yes    will have to take care|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks certain|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume the 1@S bid denied 4@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: sry Robin - not a deliberate copy:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Yes.  Not always true that 3 losers is 10 winners|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|mamos:  So Diamonds are 3-3 and soon declarer wil smile|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that the odds are on north only having 3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|STRIK3R: will find the A of @c and @s after 1@d, since 1@h was a freely bid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: this looks very good for NS, all games down and lots of values|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks on any lead, so a nice stop|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer does have entry problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i fancy this making|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|oosmanb: actually maybe it also needs A@S onside or @D 2-2, so you can get to 2nd @c trick|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: if guessing right in @h's|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: Can make 4@H if there is only 1 @H loser|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: hardly recommended but brown would have done well to balance with double|pg||

nt|rmb1: X from East?  4@C seems too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: @S partial|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: Dbl =?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|jbgood: stole it|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club switch now|pg||
nt|mamos: South squeezed out of auction|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. Either a @d lead or continue with @s|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @c lead ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not easy to pick that contract|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kirp:  3N is fairly lucky to make, 3@C could be 5 CMS looking at 3@S bid to show 4@Hs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can he play on @C instead of @H ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  W showed @S if any 4 crd major, so @S lead is not best usually|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|kirp:  may play on @Hs |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: i want to bid|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: this is what happened!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kirp:  small @H best now, but @D finesse works|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: considering his middelcards in @c, playing one round on @h's was more attempting, needed to try @c's if first @h failed?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Team Angelini picked up more imps in board 2 when the other room bid 3NT instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|kirp:  ad hope NY couldn't take 3@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: a fair punt, but didnt work out|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes, I guess J@H onside is higher %age than @C 3-3? |pg||
nt|kirp:  3@S lead certainly gave defense little chance to figure out what to do|pg||
nt|kirp:  if @H J is onside, then has time to test @Cs and if not 33, then @Ds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D finesse|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||

nt|kirp:  still only 8 trix with J@H onside|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to get 3@d tricks, so @d finesse is very much needed|pg||
nt|kirp:  S should have continued @Hs ,then needed @D finesse|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: now has to drop doubleton A@S eith east    play towards K@S    then drop ace 2nd round|pg||

nt|jbgood: guess X shows 4-5+ spades?|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: 4 more IMPs to Angelini|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3rd seat 1@H seems like it might disrupt things a bit|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: was almost expecting Olsen to open 2@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I was half expecting a 1@H opening|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not sure if he and Jan open 2@H on 5 card suites|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|jr7: I think they are trying to catch the play they are playing now!|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|kirp:  now  some problems for W|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: entry problem in East|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D might have worked better|pg||
nt|kirp:  than K@C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: small @D or AK/?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: maybe some back for Aptekar|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kirp:  small @D towards J, now W has to hope Q@C dblton|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think there were problems with small @D to J too, then you dont have tempo for @C tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: as south will play another @S, before any @C played|pg||
nt|oosmanb: tricky hand to play|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: but 3@C even if natural, might be best played as non-forcing anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: In summary, West located a diamond stopper.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl6: last board of this match, next round in 150 min. Thx all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: pass?|pg||
nt|toral5: how much is thr 1nt?|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|toral5: @C 10 wd ve been super|pg||
nt|toral5: he did find pd with the right suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: The dealing program did give us that big slam hand with the low diamond lead, so I will generously overlook this duff 1NT contract as our 'final firework'.|pg||

nt|vugraphpl7: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 100%|pg||
nt|kirp:  he was hoping NS would duck k@C and then he could switch to @Ds|pg||
nt|rmb1: 13 back. 5@D played by W in OR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: instead of about 95%|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Potential for Jans to pull some imps back then|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@H in N/S|pg||
nt|ady: swingy srt|pg||
nt|jbgood: same opening in the OR - but W preferred 5@d|pg||
nt|ady: set|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thanks to BBO and EBL for organising.  Thanks to operator.  Thanks to David and Jon|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: Yes, playing the K works if AQ is not on same hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jr7: 4@S in Ø/V only 2 down|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT  even on a heart lead    but unlikely to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:    think tahts what he was hoping for|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: actually cost more than 20%|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  doomed on early heart play|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: They've bought the hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: cannot fault e/w for not playing 3NT|pg||

pc|c8|nt|jr7: 1@C is strog, 2@C = diamond|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: now north needs to hold 10xx of hearts or another disaster|pg||
nt|kirp:  this looks straightforward|pg||
nt|ady: thx all    interesting set|pg||
