nt|jeanhari: but the bidding will help declarer|pg||
nt|jbgood: another high spade now and it looks like E will have to finesse the @h 9 to make...|pg||
nt|jeanhari: alternatively could try two round of hearts and then AQ of diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - that is a nice plan|pg||
nt|jeanhari: diamond led from south closed room so could be a swing here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: But if he is allowed to win the @d Q - can he get 3 @c tricks for the contract?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed, cant play a club from hand as souths trump will promote|pg||
nt|khaled_m: will need finesee of H(|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so problably finesse in hearts will be the best line|pg||
nt|jbgood: so i think he has to ruff high, then heart to the nine, clubfinesse, heart to king and another club finesse. if S ruffes, he is endplayed and has to lead a di|pg||
nt|khaled_m: ruff high finesse @H9 finesse club then back with a @H for another club finesse then draw trumps and endplay south|pg||

nt|jeanhari: ruff one in dummy|pg||

nt|glen: only 6 stoppers since suit splits|pg||

nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ for BBO TV since BBO mobile is not working|pg||
nt|panja: if it is 5-5 per system, E should perhaps have tried to play in 5m|pg||

nt|jfaria:  first board... W stood quiet|pg||
nt|jcomyn: do u bid 4nt w?|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 5 nj 6 tricks probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: normal contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: i feel 4th from longest and strongest works best except from an ace|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@C will find hearts, but at the cost of being too high.  Meck likeds the double fit potential|pg||
nt|roswolf: feisty bidding|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: a very sharp double|pg||

nt|roswolf: always lead a major against this bidding :) mind you i would have led a spade:(|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he may wish he had a spade higher than the eight|pg||
nt|jfaria:  chances are to play for A@c onside ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and i strongly dislike leading from a doubleton if pd didnt bid the suit|pg||

nt|hedyg: hi Bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: north thinks safety first|pg||
nt|roswolf: poor raise imo|pg||
nt|roswolf: even with a 20 hcp hand the bidding suggests a lack of tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: but the cards are kind|pg||

nt|leao:  well defended|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|MolvaM: so the target at the end of today is to stay at the top 27 in group A,  and top 5 in group B|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|granguru:  nice deception|pg||
nt|dburn: then, he could have reached a position where he threw a diamond on the king of spades, and another on the eight|pg||
nt|dburn: and another on the ruff and discard that West would have had to give him|pg||
nt|roswolf: poof declarer will end up on the embankment - draw trumps and take the club finesse -real simple|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: i will get the CCs|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks -1 for a 5 imp pickup for kamras|pg||

mb|p|nt|jeanhari: ew in 3NT doubled closed room|pg||
nt|jeanhari: down a lot... so only 4@S making will save imps or win some|pg||
nt|jbgood: dbl with the S hand made him have to bid spades at an uncomfortable level|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but 4@S has chances, obvious heart lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead should set it - or club ace and spade shift|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 7spades tricks and each in the other suits|pg||
nt|khaled_m: After @HA a trump switch |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|jbgood: a flying start for the hwite oranjes|pg||

nt|hedyg: and EW landed in 5@d|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 27+5 = 32 teams will qualify for the knockouts. members of the eliminated teams can enjoy the open pairs event starting tomorrow|pg||
nt|dburn: but this match will be fast - both teams are sure to qualify, there is no carry-over, so they will save their energies for the knock-out stages|pg||

nt|roswolf: is that supposed to be a rubbish multi?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= multi, 2M= 10-13|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl =diamonds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so this is max 9 hcps|pg||
nt|dburn: well, rubbish is as rubbish goes - that's pretty sound, not vulnerable in first seat|pg||
nt|hedyg: i never consider a 6-4 hand as rubbish anyhow|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok bid your suit is the consensus for rdbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass would show @ds, not XX|pg||
nt|dburn: but I would be surprised to find that redouble showed diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: some play that redoubled means "I don't want to compete" - they would bid 2@s to mean "I want to compete in hearts, but not spades"|pg||
nt|roswolf: americans have a marked weakness against the multi -i t is extremely discouraged in the state|pg||
nt|3for3: that is how we play the redouble.  not sure it is best. since they are often in trouble when they enter with balanced garbage|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is no carryover to the round of 32|pg||
nt|roswolf: you would hope meckwell at least have sensible methods|pg||
nt|3for3: they do play sensible methods.  but doubling 2@D is not free, especially when the partner of the multi has some diamond length|pg||
nt|hedyg: to pass with @ds is normal i believe as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 6+ @ds|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would ignore the rdbl and bid 3@C SHOWING VALUES + clubs(going via leb would be weaker)|pg||
nt|3for3: meck usually isnt this slow|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm is south choosing between 3@C OR 4@c?|pg||
nt|dburn: he may be asking questions of West, of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK seriously declarer failed to heed the significance of the diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|woozle: 6NT has chances with a spade lead - four spades, three hearts, three diamonds, one club and a squeeze on south|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but ns might get busy in h|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s was intermediate?|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs tell me XX used to be bid your major  for EW|pg||
nt|3for3: it might be west who is thinking, but i doubt it.|pg||
nt|3for3: usually these auctions are fairly automatic for the multi side.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i had assumed that rodwell's dbl showed 12-15 bal or very strong -does anyone know for sure?|pg||
nt|dburn: doesn't look as though redouble was diamonds, at any rate - West would have bid if it did|pg||
nt|3for3: i would bet with you |pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Mahaffey probably thinks he conceeded a swing in previous board..|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as long as s passes|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2H was 5H + 5other|pg||
nt|roswolf: which basically would be totally ludicrous unless it was a singleton|pg||
mb|d|nt|ntmon: but higher suit probably wins|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3@c was obviously value-showing, given North's 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Fiona Brown is very cautious with her barren 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive reopening by north|pg||
nt|panja: that 1Nt is a risk VUL|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 10-13 I am told ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: some may have doubled as east-t/o of course|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or 11-13 I am also told  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@C here on ice|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no CC for NS, soemthing between SEF and 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6nt from east cold as well|pg||
nt|panja: 5 other including @S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: a lebensohl misunderstood ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not yet|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead 4th from longest!|pg||
nt|dburn: and I suppose he might make it, if East doesn't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|jfaria:  after N said he has got the blacks there is no great deal about bidding @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dutch will get on the board here|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like it|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least it is nv|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|3for3: 3nt is reasonable spot. the diamond stopper looks weak, but as long as the clubs run, you just need AK@D in one hand or no @D lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|3for3: they got the latter...|pg||
nt|bobholl: small or @SQ ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: Q would also be my choice|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ntmon: .. now :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wikner/Kamras: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJK1.pdf|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: this may not play too well|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes, any other.  (But only in some events)|pg||
nt|panja: well, in that case, dbl must have been negative...and W should have taken out...or was the double penalty?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|woozle: four rounds of spades now will put South through the wringer|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi knows his side has a fit - if opps have a 9-card fit you are guaranteed an 8-card fit at least - but that doesn't mean you will find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might bid 4@S with the W hand once he knows about 4 card support since he has no valid defense vs 4@H except the trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can be defeated|pg||
nt|roswolf: the swedes on the first bd bid to 5@D for a game swing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3 bids on a 9 count now what|pg||
nt|panja: on B16, here, South is worried about @D control..|pg||
nt|panja: N should simply have bid 3Nt..but now, South is in a bind|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|blum1956: A player of the team which is in best 8 will hardly lead a spade against 6NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the bidding could well go 1@s-2@s-4@S at other tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have seen it said that at expert level you should never lead pard's major but lead your own suit and this hand is a good example of why|pg||
nt|panja: Lev trying to put pressure|pg||
nt|panja: the youngsters might just redbl...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called by Upmark|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he called TD cause 3NT was bid after a longgggggg huddle by S|pg||
nt|3for3: does the slow bid demonstrably suggest 3nt by Rodwell?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the TD will decide that|pg||
nt|roswolf: in my view yes 3nt is much safer when pard huddles|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time i had received some messages from kibs about the 3NT bid after a long huddle|pg||
nt|3for3: it may be safer.  but it needs to be DEMONSTRABLY suggested...the law's words, not mine|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it again looks that americans cant deal with the multi:)|pg||
nt|dburn: no more than an in-tempo 3@c bid would, I imagine - but we are not the Director, of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer thinks oh dear|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcomyn: well who does win now|pg||
nt|athene: west's defensive plan is very easy|pg||
nt|athene: just play spades and spades and spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: and get your three trump tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ilan Herbst went 2 off in OR|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would be better-off to double 3@S rather than bid 4@H, if he feels he has to do something|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think only -1 is likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: competenty done|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 13 tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lev seems to expect more from 1@D than East will deliver|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@H not very attractive for South (unless North had doubleton diamond)|pg||
nt|panja: it will be difficult to avoid 3 trump losers here...4@H doesn't look like a make|pg||
nt|rmb1: If anything, 4@S looks easier|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|athene: 4@H should be a five-card suit in my opinion|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panja: NS seem to have similar cards in @H and @S...but @S are 33 in EW hands..so 4@S might have a modicum of a chance|pg||
nt|panja: @CK, @H ruff, a trump...what is the fourth possibility for the defenders?|pg||
nt|rmb1: @HA :)|pg||
nt|panja: oh well......if Declarer tries to prevent @C ruff, he can't ruff anything himself...|pg||
nt|panja: but he could get 3 Clubs, 3 Spades, 2 Diamonds, 2 Hearts for 10|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could not do that after his pd doubled 3@S, Bill|pg||
nt|jcomyn: CQ and H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: -4 800 is a big price to pay for a bidding mixup|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ntmon: it's probable that EW will come to 4@S on many tables either on its own or pushed, but not doubled |pg||
nt|athene: no i mean in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that would be for minors, denying 4@Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is rare that pd, when he doubles 1@s, does not have 4 cards in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: not so rare these days for the top players|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all assume pd has 4 OM when he doubles a M opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is true enough|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think E could antecipate some kind of misfit...|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why does w keep bidding when he knows big hand on nhis left|pg||
pc|s6|nt|woozle: probably not, but leading from a nothing suit isn't completely safe either - can easily pick up (say) partner's queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody is very worried about the overtrick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: levazza mean business by the looks of things|pg||
nt|jfaria:  9 tricks is quite a bit in this layout|pg||
nt|panja: I thought @CK was not a good choice....for West|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: ace and another trump lookes obvious as he wasnt in 4|pg||
nt|glen: should declarer have played @S ace then @s|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d3|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think doubling just says you don't have the offensive potential in hearts to commit to bidding 4 over 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not good for south|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment bill|pg||
nt|athene: so you  can still have auctions like 1@S X 3@S X pass 4minor pass 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: saying ok, we might want to play here, but we don't have to|pg||

pc|hT|nt|MolvaM: greed?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an error by south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|MolvaM: actually he should want the @sK to be offside|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the first bd south led @sA AGAINST 4@h for -1|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c5|nt|panja: it might still make....unless @HQ entry is knocked out.So W must win @S, and switch to @HJ perhaps..let us see|pg||

pc|h4|nt|rmb1: Too many red suit losers|pg||
nt|panja: but for North's refusal to bid 2Nt..this deal would have been over long ago|pg||
nt|rmb1: Board 15 was flat in 4@SX+1 on the same auction|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: playing for @CJx onside|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h6|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: and even trump break|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rmb1: Apparently, West needed to play a @D at trick 2 to threaten a diamond overruff and North needed to play a small @H at trick 3 to establish 2 @H tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|cJ|pc|dQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would lead a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: the @SQ is looking for a brillancy prize|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but it depends on what double by eric showed - if a weak nt then it may well be assuming a club fit - but we must remember that defence could have defeated it|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: making now|pg||

nt|james_h: my time and if I can earlier|pg||

nt|roswolf: what 3@H would mean is a mystery:)|pg||
nt|athene: ok so with a 3nt bid and only four hearts, south would have done something else|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo responds 2@C on strong balanced hands with a 4-card major|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is to conceal the major if you don't have a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|athene: so if you respond showing a major then bid 3nt you promise 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: another kibber suggests they may use 3@S rebid by south as puppet to 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though NS are doing the same sort of thing|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd for -1?|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@d= 4+|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult salm to reach 6@D seems clearly superior|pg||

nt|rmb1: Losing @D finesse in 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: At the other table, North switched to a diamond at trick two, but chose the lowest...South, duly misled, led one back|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S will make if the defence foolishly try to cash @HAK, but not if they switch to a club to take out the entry to the diamonds, of course|pg||
nt|glen: thanks Hedy, typical swedish cc, very little blank space left|pg||
nt|dburn: Kokish hasn't yet managed to persuade Rodwell to overcall 1@s instead of doubling|pg||

nt|roswolf: slam is on in many denominations and level is difficult to judge too|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2 nt must be several layouts, otherwise I doubt W would enter tehe auction|pg||

nt|hedyg: XX doesnt even start to show this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: it really makes no difference to their qualifications|pg||
nt|panja: but with @DQ off, it won't make...|pg||
nt|roswolf: once when behind in a match i passed a strong club with a hand like south's and earnt myself a big swing - 1@c was the only making contract!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i was a junior at the time of course!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, now 4@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree hedy|pg||
nt|3for3: kokish basically believes there is no hand too strong to overcall.  Rodwell doesn't see it that way here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|MolvaM: even if misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|hedyg: anything is fine as long as they avoid 5@ds|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i think duboin was taking the time to light the proverbial cigarette|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: much of a muchness|pg||

pc|d7|nt|roswolf: the grand is missed i fear|pg||
nt|hedyg: Thomas thinks XX shows 3 @ss only|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 4 card fit and singleton @c he had other bids available|pg||
nt|roswolf: meckwell will probably have a similar challenge in the other room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|blum1956: clear pass for North on 2@s from my point of view, but Pszczola is a world champion which I am not|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could get 6 proverbial IMPs fine for that  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange not to correct to @s|pg||
nt|panja: the bidding doesn't really address this slam exploration...if W had @DQ instead of the @SQ, for example, it would have been a cold 6@C|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be true now too|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|leao:  if he use the @s 10 as an entry heÂ´ll be able to make one red siut finesse|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Question is  if 2nt GF W knows NS will win the auction , so no point in telling where the gold is..|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: seems to gain a few imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: not that junior but only making contract :)|pg||
nt|leao:  looks like thatÂ´s the plan|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: they did well to stop below game, but even this is probably not going to make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: seems Madala decided they would take no @H tricks if EW played|pg||
nt|glen: and the cash out stops at 4 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: better cash the K@H now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder if n passes what happens|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ntmon: reaching 4@H X would not be problem on tables, where W passes and E opens with @S preeemt|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that may mean an imp to the israelis|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: they took all their tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: always depressing for a defender when declarer wins your opening lead and swiftly returns the suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|3for3: especially at NT!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|woozle: Fiona did well on lead with a trump...a heart (or club) lead would have cost a trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is like an insult|pg||
pc|s2|nt|blum1956: as opposite to 2@s which is makeable|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|roswolf: nothing is much better here|pg||
nt|3for3: I like a low club better than the king|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm perhaps not|pg||
nt|leao:  lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: and will make so 1@C not only contract to make :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: ah le correction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|3for3: both of these teams will surely qualify for the KO's.  Kamras was leading the field entering this match|pg||

nt|ntmon: the wrong result for Monacco atributed to their EW pair in OR|pg||
nt|athene: better lead a diamond against 6@H here|pg||
nt|granguru:  1Nt or 2@D NS|pg||
nt|rmb1: I only have a one-page system summary, so I don't know what 3@S meant, and whether 3NT was forced rebid|pg||
nt|bobholl: vwd|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes for once not a lot of scope for action|pg||
nt|leao:  hard for W to duck that @s queen|pg||
mb|1D|an| |nt|mcarroll: Lots of work|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lots of work needed|pg||
nt|ntmon: leader changes after each board |pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be too hard though|pg||
nt|roswolf: another distributional fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: another pretty hand but only enough for game|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes sheer pertinacity as terence reese once remarked|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|woozle: only two certain losers, but I'm not sure how many winners|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the @D lead signposted|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is GF raise with singleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D shows 1 singleton(unspecified) + gf i am told|pg||
nt|athene: some specs might be wondering why east didn't just double|pg||
nt|roswolf: another crazy poor suit overcall imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: there are two possible explanations|pg||
nt|panja: the problem is with the 2Nt bid....whatever 3@S meant, W could hardly have crossed 3Nt...|pg||
nt|leao:  so they bid game on board 3 in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|jcomyn: finding h here will be tricky|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and game on|pg||
nt|athene: firstly they might play x as t/o of hearts (unlikely)|pg||
nt|glen: the modern style: bid five card majors, count points later|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= semi-forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT general gametrial..|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@d has some sort of play - not sure how good a contract it is|pg||
nt|rmb1: On 17, EW found a minor-suit fit 3@D-1 for 3IMP|pg||
nt|leao:  only excuse is he was 3rd in hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: secondly he just wants to emphasize he has real playing strength in diamonds so there might be a sac|pg||
nt|glen: the semi-forcing NT allows for opener, once having counted points, to pass to avoid trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: the term semi-forcing will always be a puzzle to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy +90|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus it is NOT forcing?|pg||
nt|hedyg: or just 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have noticed that the dutch are not conservative bidders|pg||
nt|leao:  they are high enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: whereas a lead-directing double could be as little as @DKQ10x or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: trumps 3-2 plus some work, I guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ntmon: much depends on methods now|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice no XX from Gino to show Kx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean: it is either forcing or it isnt?|pg||
nt|granguru:  correct|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1NT conventionally asks for point count? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: well your supposed to bid again if you have a decent hand very like drury without the guaranteed trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: , see above |pg||
nt|glen: semi-forcing is a terrible term, but was meant to distinguish between 1NT not-forcing limited to about 10 pts, and the modern style where it can have game invite values|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to pass surely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  doubt trading a plus for a a minus|pg||
nt|leao:  this shud make with the @s !!!!! finesse|pg||
nt|leao:  no need to finesse now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blum1956: not enough entries to make the @d s work and too bad @h distribution to crossruff effectively|pg||
nt|woozle: On the last board, Harding in the other room tried 3NT with the matching 4333s - down one also, but had chances for 10 in|pg||
nt|roswolf: brakes need to be applied now|pg||
nt|roswolf: simple auction|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: it is a terrible term indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but rarely does in my experience|pg||
nt|granguru:  for me semif means "you may pass if you have a sub min hand  or a min with a bal distr"|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|3for3: i'd say more than some :)|pg||
nt|3for3: but the black JT's are very useful|pg||
nt|hedyg: iv) For the KO stage, teams not in the first eight rankings in the Swiss A are re-ranked from 9-32 according to seeding based on WBF/EBL masterpoints. The teams ranked 1-8 in the ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Swiss A, in order, each pick a team from the rest of the teams seeded 9 to 32. After these first eight choices the right to select the opponent passes to the highest remaining ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: seeded team and so on until the bracket is completed. For the purposes of composing brackets the number in the bracket is |pg||
nt|hedyg: determined by the order of the selection|pg||
nt|dburn: if North leads a heart, you have to commit yourself at once - if he doesn't, you have some breathing room|pg||
nt|bobholl: when they start with 4@H and 4@C that won't make|pg||
nt|leao:  well, if theyÂ´re good enuf to bid, theyÂ´re good enuf to lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: OTT|pg||
nt|athene: i guess one other advantage for 4@D over double is it takes some room away from opps|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: 6@d by East may be better than 6@d by West for that reason, but there's not a lot the Swedes can do about that now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: which red suit to try is the question|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ntmon: very lucky for NS|pg||
pc|d4|nt|woozle: A bit sad here that the third diamond will be ruffed with the short defensive trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: if Rodwell does lead a heart, he should choose the eight and not the jack|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: since he probably would not lead the jack from KJ|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, declarer may need to pick a black suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: easier for us, as usual|pg||
nt|3for3: those black suits look very similar..|pg||
nt|panja: this could still go down...|pg||
nt|bobholl: but a @H lead is only DD|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of imps changing hands here|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: ok, it looks here as though madala has shown a diamond control|pg||
nt|panja: after @DA..EW cash Clubs and exit with @S...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: i think n/s were reckless here although who was to blame we may never know|pg||
pc|dT|nt|leao:  yes, no flat board yet|pg||
nt|leao:  good spectator sport|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jfaria:  But S really has got hte better hand... everybody talking...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: sure is i would find KJ10 on my left|pg||
nt|panja: and then on small @H by South, E wins @HQ and plays small...S might misguess|pg||
nt|rmb1: May get home with 2 @S, 4 @D, 1 @C|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: as 1 spec says, declarer can test BOTH black suits|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|hedyg: now pull 2 trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: he can play for a doubleton queen in either black suit, yes|pg||
nt|panja: not the second @S really..|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: S will get a @H instead|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcomyn: interesting b idding in open room to 4h|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|panja: but the defence was very very soft..|pg||
nt|leao:  and 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|3for3: now he has to worry about 4-1 diamonds, not sure he can do a thing about that though.|pg||
nt|panja: not cashing @C was not a great option really|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ntmon: OR bidding unclear to me - unless 1@D shows @H|pg||

mb|2S|an| |nt|glen: 2@C is the science|pg||
nt|panja: and play carefully..on @D lead, for example..you have to go up with @DA, remove trumps and hope @C suit gives you a trick|pg||
nt|leao:  heÂ´ll invite 3NT, and it shudnt be accepted|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt all pass i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: srtange move by east with a flat 8 count|pg||
nt|leao:  and 2 jacks|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: 6@H a good save here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: 2@C is a reverse inverted minor - it shows a raise to the two-level|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@c rather than 1@d was an interesting choice|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 4 Fantunes in 7@s|pg||
nt|dburn: now, if West can bid 4@h as a sort of "last train" or "Bluhmer"...|pg||
nt|roswolf: the red bars goad the players again|pg||
nt|bobholl: if opponents points all in one hand you need less to make/invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: natural or 16/17+ many hand types|pg||
nt|leao:  id pass this (and perhaps apologize later)|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Pepsi bids only 2NT...he apparently has lower standards for vulnerable 2H bids than I do|pg||
nt|woozle: Seamon-Molson raises to say "yes, I did overcall vulnerable"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and the @S Ten is a vital asset|pg||
nt|woozle: I suppose she would never have raised without it|pg||
nt|dburn: ...which apparently he can...|pg||
nt|panja: and now, on @C lead by E.....this would go down|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@S splinter|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@D cue |pg||
nt|panja: right, and 4@D cue...so @C lead is automatic...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now thats aggressive but i suppose the 5-card suit is useful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice contract|pg||
nt|dburn: ...then East-West have a chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows his hcps, though not heavy , are good|pg||
nt|3for3: not sure what rodwell's double of 4@H was, but it will make it easier, as now east can show heart control.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Upmarks XX= 1st rd control|pg||
nt|jfaria:  played by the "wrong" side, S on lead could try a @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@h probably shows any 4 card without strength being a factor|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would pass and NOT apologise|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ntmon: actually E hand is rather strong in 15-17 range|pg||
nt|ntmon: roles home now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rolls even|pg||
nt|ntmon: rolls* :)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S was natural, usually 2@Ss, less than 8|pg||
nt|roswolf: for once i understand their bidding:)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think W will try the @h and will delay @d till the end|pg||
nt|leao:  it wud look better with the @h 10|pg||
nt|roswolf: it has been led the 8 will do!|pg||
nt|leao:  but the 8 is a nice card to have for West|pg||
pc|h3|nt|glen: 3@H was the big hand, natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c either nat or any strong hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: according to the CC|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: then 3@H= strong hand with @s+@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: impressive bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: no cover :(|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: good bid, that|pg||
nt|3for3: well done ew|pg||
nt|dburn: still, even if West had only bid five, East might have bid six|pg||
nt|andyv:  may lead @ss twice to hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now @s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: exactly|pg||
nt|andyv:  even dbl dummy can't see a way to strip the hand and throw S in to break the @d suit|pg||
nt|leao:  not now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: i didnt expect this contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: should go -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you bid 1NT as W over 1@D?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: wierd e/e are still on tilt|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: no i wouldnt|pg||

nt|leao:  cud be|pg||
nt|roswolf: or even e/w|pg||
nt|leao:  :)|pg||
nt|leao:  if N had 109 in @h he can block the suit at some stage|pg||
nt|leao:  "he" meanind declarer|pg||
nt|leao:  meanind=meaning|pg||
nt|leao:  @d and @h back?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: h lkead d switch and another h but who would find that|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a natural raise you mean bill:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: "only" -5?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jfaria:  that doesnt solve the problem, but maybe  a favourable ending can be reached better that 50% chance after @h fails|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy can' take the @h hook|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's DD analysis and they do it :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: only four, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh only 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: cheap!|pg||
nt|3for3: 8 easy aces|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S must not try a @d now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club exit|pg||
nt|andyv:  he has 2 easy exits so no need to rush @d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: it's good to see people raising clubs|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't happen often :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes of course they play transfers over 1@C -doh:(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh no|pg||
nt|andyv:  but what do I know|pg||
nt|jfaria:  MUST NOT :(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why do that with 2 easy options|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now there is a psic warfare|pg||
nt|andyv:  now West has to think since S wasn't being forced to lead @d that he may be underleading his Ace. |pg||
nt|jfaria:  Should accept the gift and let run to J?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think it's a gift|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: and bocchi-Madala found that defence in open room|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but could s be underleading the ace - unlikely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  as the cards lie it is|pg||
pc|h9|nt|woozle: Fiona decided that spades aren't promising on lead, so tries a surprise attack in clubs. Pepsi is surprised, but not so surprised that he will forget to take his now ten top tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ntmon: well deserved|pg||

nt|blum1956: If North opens a strong 1NT, what will West bid&|pg||
nt|blum1956: ?|pg||
nt|woozle: North much too strong for a strong notrump...although at favourable I might open 2NT|pg||
nt|woozle: A strong notrump is the second best preempt in bridge, after 2NT|pg||
nt|woozle: Is Pepsi deep in the tank, or is this a coffee break?|pg||
nt|blum1956: This time 1@c is the worst option for North - East may even preempt in @s s wich solves the problem for EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but nobody bid h - or s I suppose, so|pg||
nt|ntmon: Lavazza builds a sound, deserved lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: better take the shortcut :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
nt|hedyg: just wanted to see if we were awake?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a simple pass would have earnt a nice 5 imp swing|pg||
nt|bobholl: first push :)|pg||
nt|leao:  rite|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda5.html  running now|pg||
nt|3for3: certainly interesting hands..|pg||
nt|rmb1: Netherland Juniour tried 6@C -1 on  19, another 11IMP to Mahaffey.|pg||
nt|panja: B21, 3N does not make for NS..but they have 27 HCP..so they will try to bid some game...|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|athene: 4@D would be a splinter we assume|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not want to do that with a singleton ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will brush the intervention aside|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be carnage|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mahaffey has dropped to 6th|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d one major|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D the other?|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this might end up in carnage|pg||
nt|leao:  another one... agree|pg||
nt|leao:  this has to be @h, no?|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess multi|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|athene: 3@D will be a spade raise anyway; presumably 3@C would be hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: unusual vs unusual|pg||
nt|3for3: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: might try 3nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, very tempting|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is on some sort of trip if he overcalls 1nt on that rubbish|pg||
nt|leao:  so they mite end up in @s.... less dreadful|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d showing invite + in @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sementa's pass says what?  I have diamonds? |pg||
nt|roswolf: they will play in 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: the auction in the other room was ultimately a phantom|pg||
nt|dburn: Cullin lurking|pg||
nt|andyv:  but dblton in @s may slow him down|pg||
nt|panja: EW, of course, might create obstacles in their path and save them|pg||
nt|leao:  hu-oh|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: and can add toit here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c would be invite + in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has sufficient defence|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just that he has nothing to say|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting problem for W|pg||
nt|leao:  3NT will NOT be a good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Fiona, bids the routine (at this vul) 2S|pg||
nt|roswolf: to the limit for west|pg||
nt|andyv:  most prudent is 4@c|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he has got the "expected"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: well predicted!|pg||
nt|roswolf: west must make his own arrangements|pg||
nt|andyv:  enterprising is 4@h|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@c looks ok to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: McGann takes the quick path to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: good judgment|pg||
nt|athene: does bocchi have to find the diamond lead for 500 here?|pg||
nt|dburn: trying to look like a man saving in 4@s|pg||
nt|panja: you mean board 18...6@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: north ignores the diversion|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: maybe this is a hand t show invite + in @H and when d bids @H bid @s to show both majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: the noose tightens|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he has no 4 cards in any other suit than @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: some superbergen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: and disappears up his own exhaust|pg||
nt|leao:  maybe, even with a @h lead...|pg||
nt|leao:  it will make now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: hmmm ok this looks as though bocchi made a forcing pass and now a slam try in spades which is surely a bit optimistic with his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south tempted to bid on!?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: duboins hand looked so good after rho opened 1@d. now it looks not so attractive|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy vey!|pg||
nt|roswolf: high noon shoot out|pg||
nt|glen: sementa rips up cards and leaves table|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a void usually means action|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose is not clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: why XX?|pg||
nt|glen: actual it is xxxx since previous xx|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely if Sementa had a better suit he would have bid it?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: now dbl?|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth has seen his sort before, though|pg||
nt|3for3: well, his hand suggests bidding too |pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= 14-16|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is an upgrade|pg||
nt|roswolf: or 13 actually:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual in your singleton|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: jaki wynik , wyniki w necie nie dzialaja |pg||
nt|andyv:  with 5 losers, it's too much to ask for a passed hand to cover 3 of them|pg||
nt|panja: 1@S seems like denying a 4 M...I am not sure it shows @D Suit ...|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S part of transfer-response structure to 1@C -  denies either major|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: good judgment again|pg||
nt|hedyg: trying to put N under pressure?|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: oops|pg||
nt|jfaria:  looks like we r watching a "all jr" TM :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  optimism galore|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting way of saying "oops", Tad:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hey leave the irish to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes even i would make this|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: will n/s run out of red cards|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: but very difficult|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW in OR might know that they're behind, so try to push|pg||
nt|panja: only 8 tricks for NS..bu cashing Diamonds might lead to some useful situation|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: passssssssssssssss|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely no need to correct to 2@H!|pg||
nt|roswolf: might give preference|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well 2 imps to the swedes|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot be a forcing pass opposite what might be just invite|pg||
nt|glen: i still think ripping up cards will result in lowest possible minus score|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 8 card fit is better than nothing|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh no !|pg||
nt|hedyg: might try 3NT after X of 3@D?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|MolvaM: ahh it goes on|pg||
nt|roswolf: frying pan into fire|pg||
nt|panja: unlikey here though, EW don't seem to have any interesting option for discarding differently..|pg||
nt|panja: W will sluff @H, E will sluff @H|pg||
nt|rmb1: Might try a @H now|pg||
nt|panja: try and slip @H trick through East?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: well it can be if you agree it is|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: what?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 card fit now|pg||
nt|hedyg: are we watching the right board?|pg||
nt|glen: now there are fires, and there is this|pg||
nt|roswolf: this would be funny a5-0 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: would be?|pg||
nt|roswolf: you shouldnt laugh at a funeral|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok folks! see? it can happen to anybody!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if duboin had not rdbl'd it would have benn just ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: next time i play in my cuebid i must try to remember this moment|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italian will be x -rated in the post mortem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like hand from the menagerie where both sides can play 2@dX|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: low trump to start|pg||
nt|granguru:  diagnostic?|pg||
nt|glen: the best thing for NS to do after the hand is leave table, then come back when decibel level is below 120|pg||
nt|hedyg: call an ambulance|pg||
nt|granguru:  --4?|pg||
nt|roswolf: gib says -7 dd|pg||
nt|granguru:  ducking is best here|pg||
nt|hedyg: desperately looking for an entry to his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if slam is on for n/s i still tale the penalty 1700|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: take|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: it is only when Madala doubles that he is better than invite|pg||
nt|3for3: a little chancy for cullin to double.  is meck is 0-2 in the blacks, might be cold, or his side could be making.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: just dont play @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@H was discouraging|pg||
nt|hedyg: in this situation it just denies the ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: seemed easier to disc 10@D|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: if the 3@D bid had been gf, then it would have been a forcing pass|pg||
nt|athene: it's reasonable enough to play pass forcing if you showed at least game invite values and opps go to 5-level; 99% of the time they are advance saccing|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: too bad it isnt on?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: joao it is go leor|pg||
nt|roswolf: in fact iwould claim 10 west is endplayed in hearts|pg||
nt|leao:  but he wud have to extract the @d first|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: the vampires gather for their feast|pg||
nt|jfaria:  singleton lead with singleton trump :) but avoiding the looser @d lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: see you even get language lessons on this show|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|glen: (promo for HBO true blood new season)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|woozle: Squeeze is broken up if North wins the second spade and leads a red suit - can't get off dummy without losing a menace|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|bobholl: will still happen :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|leao:  yes|pg||

nt|jeanhari: I think he did|pg||
nt|khaled_m: yeah we were talking of 9 trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps operator will check that|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|vugraphpl5: sorry|pg||
nt|jbgood: he had the squeeze for 10 if what we saw really took place|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|khaled_m: with 5 diamonds should not have problem bidding|pg||
nt|khaled_m: forget about 11 count|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Verhees in the closed room got a heart lead and stripped west to get his overtrick too|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if the Dutchmen play transfers after 1 @c (anybody has a name? transclub? Clansfer?)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: have to go for a moment, be back in twenty minutes|pg||

nt|3for3: as long as rodwell didnt play @D all ok.  He had no reason to against 5@S undoubled.  If Meck had doubled, might have been looking for extra 200 point undertricks.  here the goal ...|pg||
nt|3for3: was a modest +50|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hard to play at Meckwell speed, they are at least 2 boards ahead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cards very nicely placed here but still only 3nt bid|pg||
nt|panja: 6@H on one of two finesses...good 6@H really for EW|pg||
nt|bobholl: they smoke tadeusz ?|pg||
nt|leao:  2@c EW or 3@d NS... any other possibilities?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@D in other room migth go down :)|pg||
nt|leao:  here it is again :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah we now have 8|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|jcomyn: yes normal contract |pg||
nt|athene: but we just don't know the NS agreements here (or i don't anyway) :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  5-5 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: lots of hcp but not much chance of a slam|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: if west just holds up his @SA isn't he beating 5@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is, needs to hold up twice|pg||
nt|athene: he ducks twice - now if bocchi plays another trump he takes the ace and plays a fourth and the club ruff goes|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called , Ginossar think 5s was -1 |pg||
nt|athene: if bocchi ruffs a club himself, then west can simply force the south hand in clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: Tadeusz, did Gino duck the A@S?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe bocchi claimed 11 or something and west agreed without really thinking it through|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely though|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but fatigue does play its part|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that unlikely, only 4-0 @ss could beat him|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might well have played a @s from hand and claimed|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: Well i haven't seen , Bocchi has just claimed|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so we will wait, once declarer claims all play stops and you call the TD if you dont agree|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: We are waiting for decision |pg||
nt|roswolf: one fir the bulletin i think as do a few others!:)|pg||
nt|3for3: Is Upmark from the Steve Robinson school...All 5 card majors?  Otherwise, I prefer 1@D with this shape|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: me 2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2nt-3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a horrible 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: might try 3nt here a behind bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be from the same family|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may not be so easy to stay low enough - that 1@s might turn out to waste space rather than save it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 1@D for me too|pg||
nt|3for3: it often does|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it seems that West can use relays of some kind, rather than have the auction start 1@s-2@h-3@d|pg||
pc|dT|nt|MolvaM: living thru this at the table is bad, but worse will come during scoring when you say minus 1400 |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt much superior|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c gf relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: but no difficulty bidding game|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you are playing 11-13 it is not :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: 2NT= 8-10 ZZ with a singleton|pg||
nt|3for3: how do you find 6@D opposite Q@S, A@H, a @D honor and A@C?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they wont gey overboard either|pg||
nt|hedyg: ZZ points..|pg||
nt|3for3: or even less with better diamond fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: A=3, K=2 and Q=1|pg||
nt|panja: against, after the 'offside' 2Nt bid..it might be difficult to bid it with conviction....but likely, W will push it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: McGann has been there before - the big preempt putting pressure on NS in exchange for losing an occasional miracle slam|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s on the previous bd are playing in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: IN THE OTHER ROOM|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @h lead, N can get 3 @h tricks|pg||
nt|panja: that is, push it upwards|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is 2NT OK here ?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lots of controls in n hand why not 2nt|pg||
nt|dburn: but an initial 1@d would not have shown diamonds, and if East can show what he has by responding to relays, 1@s may lead to an easier auction all round|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c relay|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|woozle: Pepsi chooses to go quietly with his 17-count, fearing that a double will be pulled too often|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice judgment here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well it must be makable since NS took 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is dangerous|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it looks dangerous, but they probably have it under control|pg||
nt|3for3: this is one of the things that makes bridge hard to 'sell' to the general public.|pg||
nt|panja: ok to upgrade a point...even if your range is 20-21|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok maximum then|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: e/w will need a lot of the captain's coffee at the end of this match she wont be very sympathetic|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think W may be squeezed on the reds|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: "please continue to play, i will give you my decision"|pg||
nt|3for3: Even expert commentators have no clue what is happening|pg||
nt|panja: but I don't quite like the 2Nt opening itself.........it is an 'offside' opening, to borrow a term from football, too far too soon, a self-preemptive...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|woozle: If the match were closer, he probably would have acted|pg||
nt|blum1956: This is a partscore board besides McGann has another opinion))|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS play negative frre bids (NFB) after intervention, so S has extras and N accepts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree but prefer playing from n|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@C showing short?|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about @H?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: i am sure there is no bid to show both singletons|pg||
nt|dburn: I expect that by now West knows what East has|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@C was probably 5161 with a stiff DUECE of hearts :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: If 4@D is purely choise of games then East must bid 4@H,  If 4@D has slam try overtones surely East must bid on with a fit for both suits|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|granguru:  Duboin should have passed 1@H doubled but I give sementa the greatest part of guilt.for not passing 2@C.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Swedish experts think he showed exact pattern, thus wasted hcps in W hand|pg||
nt|dburn: people don't spend months and years devising these methods just to make life difficult for the commentators|pg||
nt|dburn: they do it because it helps them reach more right contracts than wrong ones|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jfaria:  but that would require a perfect dd play by N I think|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: h lead from w would n ot be nice|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lot of messages from specs about the last board|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree with that 1@HX probably not too bad|pg||
nt|granguru:  although 2@C is probably -4 |pg||
nt|glen: would make a fun "you be the judge" in the "the bridge world"|pg||
nt|leao:  oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: suckered into it|pg||
nt|leao:  his main trick source has just sprung a leak|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ntmon: sure, @H better for defence but again .. not easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is quite clear: if the A@S is ducked twice he cannot make 5@ss|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru:  it will surely appear in some more years|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know the ages of the dutch juniors|pg||
nt|bobholl: only @H now will result in loss for netherlands white|pg||
nt|leao:  does pard know about the @d?|pg||
nt|bobholl: can he read the @H 8 i doubt it and he doesn't know the @D situation|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: d and small c and pray|pg||
nt|ntmon: actually case is good after lead from @SA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: going to the wire|pg||
nt|granguru:  I will send the hand ..@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but might be censored as not beinf suitable for a family audience|pg||
nt|granguru:  :)|pg||
nt|glen: nowadays, likely up on bridgewinners and/or bridgetopics in 1 day|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: cant be thinking anything but a s|pg||
nt|leao:  now unblock...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|leao:  or not :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: home now i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bet the score stands though - if the claim was accepted even though in error - thats it unless it was impossible to win the number of tricks claimed|pg||
nt|roswolf: which it clearly wasnt|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not so sure - declarer is meant to give a line of play|pg||
nt|granguru:  :$|pg||
nt|3for3: Mind you, I am not against science.  It just lessens the ability for the spectators to watch and enjoy|pg||
nt|hedyg: you mean they dont hate us???|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panja: yes....but at this juncture...I guess EW are content with playing middle of the road game|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcomyn: tx all|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|leao:  @c and @h back|pg||
nt|leao:  and -2|pg||
nt|roswolf: they are making heavy weather of this defence|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|MolvaM: 5@d went down|pg||
nt|glen: on some layouts where opener has both minor aces and the @Hs split 4-2 or 3-3, 3NT will have play on this board|pg||

nt|bobholl: all is well that ends well but i was getting nervous :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd 10 now please|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have 1@HX at -2 and -3 and 2@c X is -3|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: thus it was a close call to pass 2@H, but that got +110|pg||
nt|hedyg: John surely 1@D X already meant that?|pg||
nt|panja: E hand was 20 points on this scale|pg||
nt|roswolf: 8 not played!?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: solid 2nt for m,e|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= 16+|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Lev and Pepsi reached the right contract with only one artificial bid, but the number of ways to skin a cat remains greater than one|pg||
nt|3for3: dbl=points, 5-8 or so.  not 'negative'|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: some will preemt with N hand|pg||
nt|athene: interesting - no Ghestem for this NS pair|pg||
nt|athene: but most italian pairs do play some sort of ghestem|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the E hand you bid X and pray pd doesnt bid 3@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well most of the time..could have been  a GOSH or a 2-suited hand also|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@S splinter|pg||
nt|panja: rather light double by West, helps them find a very good sac|pg||
nt|leao:  they didnt like board 8, i guess|pg||
mb|2D|nt|woozle: Now a notrump partscore, probably with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 4@H more normal although may double|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Probably best described as a Joey Silver hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: another "void hand"|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2@s was probably nonforcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s obviously nf|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: sry Murat|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kamras really doesnt want to play in @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  more tempted to open N hand 1@c|pg||
mb|2S|nt|blum1956: the @h position is of that special sort so nothing may disturb this contract|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S possible with such a good suit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: action again|pg||
nt|3for3: Rodwell's 4@S a coincidence.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and chosen|pg||
nt|hedyg: they do play Ghestem on their CC|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes partner has good diamonds and weak hearts and you can make 4@S but not 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: just maybe not with @cs|pg||
nt|athene: throwing hearts on diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  the spot cards are awful|pg||
nt|rmb1: Another double-digit swing to Mahaffey on 20, no club lead against 4@H +1 on a less revealing auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what now - dicey|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this wont go for 1400 but in context a similar result|pg||
nt|granguru:  well -16 is not the worst we have seen|pg||
nt|hedyg: any reason his pd could not have 7 good @hs and void in @s?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4 baldy aces not your best holding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and note no other card higher than 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does have the good 7 card suit part|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4h was a bit exaggerated for my taste|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@h would be ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems to be -3|pg||

nt|roswolf: 800 is not a scratch|pg||

nt|roswolf: this brings bridge into disrepute|pg||
nt|roswolf: a constructive auction to a 4-2 fit - save me please|pg||
nt|leao:  the @c community shud file a complaint|pg||
pc|h2|nt|woozle: 4S is cold|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s could be made|pg||
nt|woozle: with CA onside, diamond position, spade position and no diamond ruff coming|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@C may not be wise - who has the @S suit? probably partner, and is weak ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big finish for someone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it isnt lavazza|pg||
nt|ntmon: .. but this is not the case|pg||
nt|3for3: meck bought a nice hand from rodwell, who could have had nada.  K@D and stiff heart very useful|pg||
nt|roswolf: well imo east should rebid 1nt - to avoid this torture|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: Yes but has to get @Ds right|pg||
nt|hedyg: can not be more than invite by passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||

nt|jcomyn: frying pan into the toaster|pg||
nt|athene: nope, he tries 3 anyway|pg||

nt|hedyg: but that wont happen|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: east will accept!?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|woozle: McGann tries 4H, down one or two on a spade guess with the club hook failing|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 2@s should be enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: everything is friendly|pg||
nt|granguru:  Italoswiss is a kib with very good memory|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now!|pg||
nt|hedyg: help the defense ofc|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|woozle: down one...Fiona surely won't try the SK now|pg||
nt|blum1956: -50 against -140 or -170 is a useful 3 imps|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ntmon: X should secure @C lead against 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 card out of 3 is on side|pg||
nt|rmb1: This club stop is not going to stand close inspection|pg||
nt|panja: luckily for NS..@HA is with E, and @DK, with West...|pg||
nt|panja: so there are 8 tricks..|pg||
nt|bobholl: jansma - paulissen bid 1@D 1@S 1NT much better but surely not best|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6 + more imps dribble away|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: craziest contract of the week|pg||
nt|roswolf: north needs to avoid being endplayed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think he can get endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: endplay is unlikely because after ruffing a club and drawing trumps, west has no trumps left so a fourth club is fine|pg||
nt|3for3: i believe the higher you are, you get bonus in KO's, re selection of opponents.  Hedy posted the rule earlier|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10:00 AM CET|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is for teams 1-8, the rest are seeding as per EBL or WBF seeding points|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|roswolf: well strong club systems have their downsides too|pg||
nt|leao:  why not pass 2@c? play in the 4-4 fit instead of in the (putative) 5-2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: even A@H and @H is fine|pg||
pc|s6|nt|woozle: I fear at this point that 3 isn't enough|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||

pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: hope no children are watching|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|woozle: South could try for down two by ducking the first club|pg||
nt|athene: maybe @S6-@S4 is a subtle signal asking for a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: but bocchi can see it doesn't really matter i think|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|panja: if W discards a @S..E will have to go up with @HA next trick..I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w should take a refresher course on their system or else change it!:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||

nt|leao:  on the other table the @c view was taken, but declarer run into a @c ruff |pg||
