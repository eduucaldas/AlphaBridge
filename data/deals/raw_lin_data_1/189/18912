mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|davpro: Who is Brogeland playing with?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davpro: Ah- there the name came|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  You have seen too manu bad overcalls, when you sell out with the North hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  south hand is known as Bridge World Death Hand (BWDH)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  invitational values with 3-card support for partner|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a nice hand with spade values and N has an easy raise to game with 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has built a trap - will remove to 5 @H, only losing 100 I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is there a reward for "slowest bid hand of the tournament" - without special reason...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello all|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Gerben42:  with Qxxxx x Axxx xxx North would pass and 4@S would be cold|pg||

nt|jbgood: going through the motions|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup: looks dangerous -all tricks possible|pg||

pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  13 tricks - over|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  or 12|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: One of the answers is to use an artificial tool to separate hands with 3 card spades and those with 0-2|pg||

nt|roswolf: 10 or 11 tricks operator?|pg||
nt|davpro: there was actually 12 to take (double dummie)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|davpro: 10 point all around. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Peter and Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bridge_one: with 6/5 and only 1 defencive trick normally better to play in attack|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|runnerup: perhaps east should take it away -he has got support in hearts so ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: Angelini seems to be in the A Swiss almost no matter what happens in this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: y and Mossop will need a good result to joij them|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|davpro: *join|pg||
nt|jbgood: 24 vps to Mossop |pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 from each group to A - the others to B|pg||
nt|pelu: hard decision by S - 4@H is down 1 and 5@c also down 1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c looks good|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 5@c making - only defense is @H lead and the @S - kill the entry for the 4. @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  About 12 tricks again - but lucky and only in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jxxx in @D are very much - the double by Versace means balanced hand value in @S - Zaleski can reopen|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: kibs rush in to tell me that if defence plays spades 5c cant make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbgood: then 27 from A and 5 from B go on to the KO stage|pg||
nt|davpro: They found a 6-1 fit instead of the 6-0 fit. On level higher though|pg||
nt|pelu: has to take 3x@C befor @D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eamongall: the non-vul Townsend might venture an insurance 4@Hs |pg||
nt|jbgood: but I think a black suit or even NT play better than @ds|pg||
nt|davpro: y|pg||
pc|h9|nt|MolvaM: we see all 4 hands but sometimes at the table it is not obvious to shift to spades|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2@C forcing one round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best lead: @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - NORTH is declarer... - wake up|pg||
nt|pelu: yes defense has to kill @SA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: south wont get in much to lead trumps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would also make on the @S-lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead small @S possible but @H equivalent - many use to overcall 1@S in West to give the lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with weak 5332 i agree to pass like Versace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But an overcall would put the contract in South, so...|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing really helps,but contracts should have been by south this time -by n= -if spade lead,but now 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the option between @H and @S lead is a typical problem in bridge|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eamongall: Now defence need to get active |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: and wont necessarily lead one anyway:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - wrong table:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe 2 |pg||
pc|sK|nt|eamongall: still time |pg||
nt|bagman: N has to duck the @HK if W plays a low heart|pg||
nt|bagman: Both N and S know that there are no spade tricks to make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even in the case of a spade shift, stuurman has to be very careful to keep all his diamonds and let his spade honor go|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: i prefere to lead in the suit more solid, but without a solid suit i prefere the lead from small cards - but is is only a opinion|pg||
nt|jbgood: NT is more flexible than 3@d|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bagman: They also see the clubs so they can make extra tricks only from trumps|pg||
mc|9|nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|Gerben42:  with a bit more fortune it would have been a claimer|pg||

nt|Walddk2: How much does that spiral cost?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: 10 imps, a steep price :)|pg||
nt|athene: one general point i think worth a mention - when you play very artificial methods, and you have a long auction looking for slam, there is a strong tendency to push for slam at the ...|pg||
nt|athene: end even if you know it's only (say) 50%|pg||
nt|athene: because you sort of feel "well, we did all this, it seems a pity just to stop in game"|pg||
nt|athene: i know that might seem a bit silly but i think it's a factor|pg||
nt|athene: one spec points out that 6@S is the slam to be in (without @D lead)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H  2NT (GF with support)  ;  3@C (singleton)  3@S  ;  4@H  pass  is an auction I can recommend|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  4NT perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: but E has a hand where she can prevent NS from changing that information. After 1@C, E can bid 4@H and then?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. tough if 1@C can be short (3 or even 2 cards)|pg||
nt|bagman: if 4NT shows primary diamonds and secondary clubs then it's the bid|pg||

nt|ritong: before raising to 4@s, helness indicates he has a balanced hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Not so bad facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|ritong: i am not scandalized with 2@h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jtr: Would be dreeadful if partner had not passed|pg||
nt|jtr: dreadful|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not until you concede 800 against nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: LHO is unpassed|pg||
mb|d|an|.|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jtr: If the worst thing my partner ever did was bid 2@h i would be in heaven:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: No thinking of bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|jtr: Now|pg||
nt|jtr: Which might get out for 500|pg||
nt|jtr: Although Roland's 800 might come into play again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Richly deserved|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: 5@H is such a poor bid long term, needing 4@S to make, enough to prevent -800|pg||

nt|hawe45:  West must play this 3 NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: more distributional hands|pg||

nt|pelu: 5@H could cost 500|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@h could just escape for down 3 I guess|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|bagman: W has so much extras that he can afford to bid the game in NT instead of looking for the spades|pg||

nt|MolvaM: good lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bagman: E bid 3NT to show the spade stopper in case W was interested in that; If W had a huge @H raise, he would not pass 3NT|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed a M?|pg||
nt|davpro: 2@d balanced hand , 3@c a major, 4@d ask major  (according to a kib)|pg||
nt|jbgood: probably|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
