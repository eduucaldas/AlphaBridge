mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Gerben42:  welcome back in Poznan|pg||
nt|davpro: Morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hawe45:  A splinter in North would do fine - in later defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|davpro: Thx operator. It looked like an forcing pass-opening :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|davpro: Who is Brogeland playing with?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|davpro: Ah- there the name came|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hawe45:  You have seen too manu bad overcalls, when you sell out with the North hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  south hand is known as Bridge World Death Hand (BWDH)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  invitational values with 3-card support for partner|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a nice hand with spade values and N has an easy raise to game with 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has built a trap - will remove to 5 @H, only losing 100 I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is there a reward for "slowest bid hand of the tournament" - without special reason...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello all|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Gerben42:  with Qxxxx x Axxx xxx North would pass and 4@S would be cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  but there is normally no perfect answer|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 10 tricks are on ice here|pg||
nt|roswolf: players names will be up in a mo|pg||
nt|jbgood: going through the motions|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|runnerup: looks dangerous -all tricks possible|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed 4@s and E might have shown 4@h. I don't know their system :(|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jbgood: puppet i think - then 3@d shows 1 or 2 4 card majors, and deny 5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  13 tricks - over|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  or 12|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: One of the answers is to use an artificial tool to separate hands with 3 card spades and those with 0-2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 6 is down with @H lead|pg||
nt|davpro: y- that was my guess too|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|h5|pc|h9|mc|9|nt|davpro: Declarer can count to 9. Lets see if he tries for more|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|hedyg: k|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hedy, I do not think declarer took the @h finesse|pg||
nt|ballebodk: when you have the W hand and hear p to open 1 sp you dont like him much but when he rebid 2 sp you look around the room for a new pard :) - but its a good pas from W, before you ...|pg||

nt|ballebodk: i'm pretty sure when you look at the scoresheets afterwods you will find several that have ended in big trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: but not with new partners!|pg||

nt|roswolf: 10 or 11 tricks operator?|pg||
nt|davpro: there was actually 12 to take (double dummie)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|davpro: 10 point all around. |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with 6/5 and only 1 defencive trick normally better to play in attack|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|runnerup: perhaps east should take it away -he has got support in hearts so ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: Angelini seems to be in the A Swiss almost no matter what happens in this match|pg||
mb|2S|nt|davpro: y and Mossop will need a good result to joij them|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|davpro: *join|pg||
nt|jbgood: 24 vps to Mossop |pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 from each group to A - the others to B|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  About 12 tricks again - but lucky and only in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jxxx in @D are very much - the double by Versace means balanced hand value in @S - Zaleski can reopen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: then 27 from A and 5 from B go on to the KO stage|pg||
nt|davpro: They found a 6-1 fit instead of the 6-0 fit. On level higher though|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eamongall: the non-vul Townsend might venture an insurance 4@Hs |pg||
nt|jbgood: but I think a black suit or even NT play better than @ds|pg||
nt|davpro: y|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: so 2@C forcing one round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best lead: @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - NORTH is declarer... - wake up|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: south wont get in much to lead trumps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would also make on the @S-lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead small @S possible but @H equivalent - many use to overcall 1@S in West to give the lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with weak 5332 i agree to pass like Versace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But an overcall would put the contract in South, so...|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing really helps,but contracts should have been by south this time -by n= -if spade lead,but now 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the option between @H and @S lead is a typical problem in bridge|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eamongall: Now defence need to get active |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: and wont necessarily lead one anyway:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - wrong table:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe 2 |pg||
pc|d7|nt|eamongall: still time |pg||
nt|bagman: N has to duck the @HK if W plays a low heart|pg||
nt|bagman: Both N and S know that there are no spade tricks to make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: i prefere to lead in the suit more solid, but without a solid suit i prefere the lead from small cards - but is is only a opinion|pg||
nt|jbgood: NT is more flexible than 3@d|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bagman: They also see the clubs so they can make extra tricks only from trumps|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|s3|nt|jbgood: an imaginative E might bid 3@c then:)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|eamongall: At another table McGann Brown have reached the happy position of having 3 vulnerable doubled undertricks available against 4@S ...they still have to collect them |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|Gerben42:  going plus got to be worth something|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so far +100 is almost worth everything|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if Madala is N then S is Rimstedt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  operator please correct S name?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bridge_one: i think finesse in @C give more % at declarer|pg||

mb|2C|an|.|nt|ballebodk: if fantoni have taken h9 and played d J the contract would have been one down. i think nunes is a litte &%Â¤% right now as he found the right defense but pard ..... |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes Fantoni didnt see it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|hedyg: on the other hand, Nunes could have saved the situation by playing a 2nd @H, not a @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think it would have been still -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|hedyg: so it took the 2 of them ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ballebodk: are you sure - if garvey trumfs and play club right away i think he is home again |pg||
nt|hedyg: of course i am not sure :)|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|ballebodk: should bee a borring 3 NT from our point, as when d is 3-3 there are at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  with very friendly @d, Fantoni has 9 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orr7t1-1.htm|pg||
nt|eamongall: don't think there was any killing defence this time |pg||
nt|hedyg: Mossop in 2NT only|pg||
nt|hedyg: making 4|pg||
nt|ballebodk: nope but his comunicationslines is bad so i think he has to decide very what do play on - could he win with d 4-2 if sp A is in place ? wtith 1 s, 3h, 3, 2c |pg||

nt|eamongall: hi eamon. if east switches to @ds a mere mortal would begin to sweat.... to quote bernix |pg||
nt|hedyg: wait for opps to give you rest|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni is not a mere mortal :p|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eamongall: garvey got some tough @C discarding to do here to save overs|pg||
nt|ballebodk: its at little odd that the stopped in 2NT with 16hp+10hp - these guys normally bid 3 NT on 23-24 ballanced !|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: EW are currently 4th fighting for a medal|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|runnerup: normal 4 @h = with no other ideas -from anyone -looks like it ,but..|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bagman: Rimsted clearly gambling with her heart suit|pg||
nt|davpro: yes. 9 easy tricks, but not the best communications...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 nt - 2 @h - 2 NT - 3 NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  some would call it practical :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all colors taked by weak players :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North bid both, @D and @H|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: N should know that the @c king counts for full - and bid 3 imo|pg||
pc|s6|nt|davpro: They stopped low, but if @ds are not 3-3 a higher contract would be a struggle|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Gerben42:  with a bit more fortune it would have been a claimer|pg||
nt|bagman: In pairs it might not be that practical as the bonus for the game is not that big as in teams|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: duck this @D could be a idea|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gives the same result, if South plays safe|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  if it starts 1@C 4@H, what does S bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4NT perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: but E has a hand where she can prevent NS from changing that information. After 1@C, E can bid 4@H and then?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. tough if 1@C can be short (3 or even 2 cards)|pg||
nt|bagman: if 4NT shows primary diamonds and secondary clubs then it's the bid|pg||
