mb|1D|an| |nt|ralfwil: Interesting match to watch!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And 2M is a constructive weak 2, 2@D garbage|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: and for the 98763 time in his life, Meckstroth opens 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Upside-down count and attitude|pg||

nt|glen: E has two choices: X, or 3@H|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: expect 2NT to be @D transfer, and 3@C = likes @Ds|pg||
nt|glen: and now W has to decide is it a good day for not vulnerable games|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: so 3@H = singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: diff when u have 2 singletons :)|pg||
nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
nt|rado: @D lead and @S underlead Ak will beat it but unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  just in time for an exciting board :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, 5@S will make|pg||
nt|jfaria:  who could bid it?|pg||
nt|glen: W may think his 4@Ss means that E has a singleton or void|pg||
mb|3D|an|.|nt|galadriel: Do you think North should bid one more? Or is he worried to push them into makingslam?|pg||
nt|thenapster: hi all:)|pg||

nt|tsadek: I like Verhees bid of 3@S in closed room , Force his pd to bid 4@C with K@C|pg||
nt|pelu: not easy when two players from so dif nations and diff style play together|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jfaria:  my connection is so slow that i fear commenting one game after the one is played :(|pg||

nt|psyck: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: again some action with all hands non-balanced|pg||

mb|d|an|.|nt|thenapster: the danish pair is playing 4h in borad number 1...probably 5 imps for the amercians as a start|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jfaria:  @d keep being a safe rescue for nt oppeners .)|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: Hi all|pg||
nt|galadriel: They will get to 3NT here|pg||
nt|galadriel: which is a tricky contract|pg||
nt|galadriel: plenty of HCP but no real source of tricks|pg||
nt|jfaria:  y, trick power in every suit|pg||
nt|jfaria:  probably will get a favourable lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rado: hi|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|glen: some partnerships have given up game invites on the N type hands, just blast 4@S and hope the unknown nature of the hand can help|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h had play, but mostly double dummy, so as you say, likely -1|pg||
nt|thenapster: not a good descion to bid 4cl..that will go -3 instead of 3sp down|pg||
nt|glen: it don't like 4@C on the 3-2-2-6|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|glen: here the 3@h and then 4@S indicates a stonger idea|pg||
nt|jfaria:  big swing first board|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brotherp: hi all|pg||
nt|brotherp: lets see if Denmark can come back|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|glen: but hard for N to find the perfect cards in the S hand for slam|pg||
pc|s4|nt|glen: good duck at trick 1|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|glen: greco-hampson (in another match) reached 3@S|pg||
nt|galadriel: They got X'd in 5@S in other room for 850|pg||
nt|jfaria:  double game swing outch!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Interestingly, it was South who competed to 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Both pairs play Precision. I think I can find EW's CC, one moment|pg||
pc|sK|nt|glen: now what does S do?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|glen: and their opps did likewise|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brotherp: hi joao|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|thenapster: so 5-0 for Maheffey after the first board of the segment|pg||
nt|psyck: The @h's not dgood enuf, so while the 1st endplay worked, 2nd will not help |pg||
nt|psyck: so likely -2 now|pg||
nt|thenapster: yes|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the last hand,a pretty hand 2 defeat 5hrts,wud require gud defence|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/norway/groetheim-tundal.pdf|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h8|nt|brotherp: we can all see that it's easy now: just play north for the @s-king|pg||

nt|brotherp: yup|pg||
nt|jfaria:  lets see|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|brotherp: and he even might look at the @s 2 as a funny discard|pg||

nt|brotherp: askgaard guessing for @c J9 or @S q now|pg||
nt|dburn: weird sort of position, this|pg||
nt|jfaria:  if N plays a @s Pepesi must put the king|pg||
nt|dburn: even @cJ9 won't help him|pg||
nt|brotherp: and he can see @H 8 discard was more or less forced and not lavinthalish|pg||

nt|jfaria:  so u must play him for holding the K|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|nt|brotherp: y.. but then if he doesnt play a spade it does suggest the king|pg||
nt|brotherp: windows behind windows|pg||
nt|jfaria:  my point :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  lol|pg||
nt|dburn: how will declarer make the contract, if South has the king of spades?|pg||
nt|brotherp: really nice poker hand -- the 'same-ness' between poker and bridge cant be stressed enough|pg||
nt|brotherp: cross with the club and play the heart|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - but if that would work. North would have played a spade, not a club|pg||
nt|brotherp: we discussed that.. but north might be holding uncomfortable holdings like Jxxxx|pg||
nt|brotherp: so he wouldnt 'always' play a spade without the king|pg||
nt|brotherp: they might all feel like this will be the match-clincher|pg||

nt|brotherp: mmm|pg||
nt|brotherp: now S!A seems obvious|pg||
nt|brotherp: @sa|pg||
nt|dburn: not much more obvious than it seemed before - why should South not have started with three spades and three clubs?|pg||
nt|brotherp: catering for the squeeze i mean (if south holds this distribution with @sK)|pg||
nt|brotherp: pepsi might be playing north for the club length however and still go for the throw-in squeeze|pg||
nt|brotherp: if south has 3-3 blacks he can play SA and duck a spade (they only have 1@H to cash)|pg||
