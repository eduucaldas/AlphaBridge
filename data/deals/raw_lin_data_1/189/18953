nt|glen: and now W has to decide is it a good day for not vulnerable games|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: so 3@H = singleton|pg||

nt|jfaria:  who could bid it?|pg||
nt|glen: W may think his 4@Ss means that E has a singleton or void|pg||
pc|sA|nt|galadriel: Do you think North should bid one more? Or is he worried to push them into makingslam?|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|sharkey: Some may overcall 1@S Vul - not Meckstroth...|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: This will cost half a flat in Mayfair, London, if they double|pg||

nt|bigtrain: the spots are definitely threatening|pg||
nt|pelu: no he will go out with a @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's easy for Bjarnarson to win the first club after Askgaard has shown at least 3 in the auction|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c5|pc|d5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|pc|d6|nt|pelu: small @h or @D will work|pg||

nt|sharkey: Running scores from all Open Team matches : http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or16runda1.html|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: they should|pg||
nt|dburn: any red card, I think|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|jfaria:  obviously N was afraid of doing something weird|pg||
nt|galadriel: These high level decisions are so difficult|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|an|.|nt|glen: we the mention of meckwell we are now down to 2 specs|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rado: again some action with all hands non-balanced|pg||
nt|rado: N may bid @C 1st hoping to introduce @S later by DBL , or direct start with DBL|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
mb|3H|nt|thenapster: the danish pair is playing 4h in borad number 1...probably 5 imps for the amercians as a start|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|alok_daga: Hi all|pg||
nt|galadriel: They will get to 3NT here|pg||
nt|galadriel: which is a tricky contract|pg||
nt|galadriel: plenty of HCP but no real source of tricks|pg||
nt|jfaria:  y, trick power in every suit|pg||
nt|jfaria:  probably will get a favourable lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|rado: hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: some partnerships have given up game invites on the N type hands, just blast 4@S and hope the unknown nature of the hand can help|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h had play, but mostly double dummy, so as you say, likely -1|pg||
nt|thenapster: not a good descion to bid 4cl..that will go -3 instead of 3sp down|pg||
nt|glen: it don't like 4@C on the 3-2-2-6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|glen: here the 3@h and then 4@S indicates a stonger idea|pg||
nt|jfaria:  big swing first board|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|glen: but hard for N to find the perfect cards in the S hand for slam|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|glen: good duck at trick 1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|glen: greco-hampson (in another match) reached 3@S|pg||
nt|galadriel: They got X'd in 5@S in other room for 850|pg||
nt|jfaria:  double game swing outch!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Interestingly, it was South who competed to 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Both pairs play Precision. I think I can find EW's CC, one moment|pg||
pc|d2|nt|glen: now what does S do?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|glen: and their opps did likewise|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|thenapster: so 5-0 for Maheffey after the first board of the segment|pg||
nt|psyck: The @h's not dgood enuf, so while the 1st endplay worked, 2nd will not help |pg||
nt|psyck: so likely -2 now|pg||
nt|thenapster: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|alok_daga: the last hand,a pretty hand 2 defeat 5hrts,wud require gud defence|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/norway/groetheim-tundal.pdf|pg||

mb|2H|an|.|mb|p|nt|alok_daga: Qx,Qx,hardly an opening hand,M also 2 2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Michal, you sure?|pg||
mb|2S|an|.|mb|p|nt|pelu: here NL had 5Â½ bidding-round to find 4@S with 6@s almost cold|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Only 1 IMP in it, but that could be important with the scoreline this close|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Corrected now|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: sry bad claim|pg||
nt|Walddk5: np|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: in the other room EW made six bids without @S, but then accidently bid the suit to play there|pg||
nt|rado: we've seen many wild openings those days:)|pg||
nt|psyck: well, if they just play trump, that may also work|pg||
nt|glen: sadly all bbo tables do not fit nicely into my iphone :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|glen: the 4@S bid here will be enough to get to slam now|pg||
nt|glen: even though EW are just temporary italians, they will use roman keycard blackwood|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure ita not easy to find out that the hands fit so well|pg||
nt|glen: Q. what is 2NT, A. unknown to us, but likely forcing game try, that in this case is a slam try|pg||

nt|glen: EW is a sponsor-pro partnership, and they tend to try to keep things error free, let the meckwells win the imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|galadriel: This may not be everyone's opening|pg||

nt|jfaria:  well EW got kucky with a light opening first board|pg||
nt|galadriel: My view is that, if it is your partnership style to open these hands, that's fine, but the system must have good brakes|pg||

nt|dburn: mind you, his team-mates won't be very pleased with him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the tennis agony as well; not easy to be a Dane right now|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least West has to play it, which is no more than he deserves after that overcall|pg||
nt|pelu: EW never bid their 7 card fit in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: lead the wrong side. TD at the table|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, the people at the table may not have realised that West has to play it|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: K@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DK led out of turn|pg||
nt|dburn: and South has led @dK out of turn|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW need all the help they can get|pg||
nt|dburn: so one of East's options is to have West play it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Call the paramedics|pg||
nt|sharkey: For kibs - This auction is not in the text books |pg||
nt|bigtrain: how can yo9u lead out of turn behind screens?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have more Valiums for Danish kibitzers if they need one|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud only be shown after 10 pm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bjarnarson may just elect to let Askgaard plat this misery....|pg||
nt|dburn: it's not so bad - declarer has two diamond tricks on top, and they're going to have to give him something in the majors - perhaps two heart tricks, or one heart and one spade|pg||
nt|sharkey: *play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can non Danish also apply for Valium? I am asked. Why not, we have at least one pharmacist in the audience|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: if declarer bans Rodwell from leading a diamond, that ban remains in force while Rodwell remains on lead - he cannot, for example, cash a club and shift to a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: LEAD K@D |pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: W is on the Table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is funny. Denmark at some stage were redoubled in 2@H in both rooms :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but in fact West has chosen to let East play it, so South's lead of @dK is accepted|pg||
nt|sharkey: BBO doesnt accept lead out of turn so Simona is filling us in 1st trick|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|dburn: but BBO doesn't allow a lead out of turn, so the first trick will be played "backwards"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Conclusion: don't trust Danish 2@H bids|pg||
nt|sharkey: May have accepted David |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danish pastries, however ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: who's playing the hand Simona?|pg||

mb|p|nt|glen: interesting 2NT|pg||
mb|3C|an|.|nt|glen: a bid underpowered by high card points, but the playing value is certainly 2NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rado: E will try for Slam for sure|pg||
