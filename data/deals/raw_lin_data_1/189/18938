nt|rcerreto: hi everybody|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|stc: hi, Place 25(89VP) against place 29(86), a large win will probably qualify|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|3N|nt|bagman: I would guess that Kanin qualifies with a win and Consus needs something better to qualify|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbgood: 25 vs 29 - 27 teams from A go on to the KO stage|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: and 5 from B|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bagman: A spade lead would give the 10th trick here|pg||
nt|jbgood: and duly found|pg||
nt|rcerreto: only an unlikely @h lead would surely set|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: now home, down on a @H lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@s was a good save|pg||
nt|bagman: South holds a good looking hand for a nonvulnerable preempt and can go to 4NT and expect to make it|pg||

pc|c3|nt|rcerreto: only on a @d lead, I think|pg||
nt|rcerreto: or, A@s and then @d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bagman: The defense has to play on the assumption that the contract can be set and might give an overtrick|pg||

nt|kirp:  ok looks we r ready|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kirp:  hello |pg||
mb|4S|nt|Gerben42:  welcome back in Poznan|pg||
nt|davpro: Morning all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes   h   missing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult grand to bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems bochi plays in both rooms :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: Ola Joao, Hi all|pg||
nt|kirp:  interesting hand to start off with, NS in @Hs, EW in @Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup: here norht has 5-6 -majors and opened-now ew shoud find 5 @d that is the goal let see|pg||
nt|glen: the problem with 4@C is that 3NT is no longer possible|pg||
mb|5C|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|glen: the good news is that W can't show both majors as over 3@C|pg||
mb|5S|nt|hawe45:  A splinter in North would do fine - in later defense|pg||
nt|jfaria:  ola Danilo|pg||
nt|granguru:  brogeland for Angelini team and zapadinski for Mirage arrived|pg||
nt|glen: with the @D layout, 5@C loses a @S and two @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|davpro: Thx operator. It looked like an forcing pass-opening :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this is 200 -not enought but ..|pg||
mb|d|nt|davpro: Who is Brogeland playing with?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty operator|pg||
nt|kirp:  they need to take ruff quickly or 4@H makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  intersting hand to start off with|pg||
nt|granguru:  this is round 6/7 of swiss stage in poznan, Poland|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like down 1 or 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: Ah- there the name came|pg||
nt|runnerup: @s ruff needed|pg||
nt|granguru:  Looks like precision system in NS |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  You have seen too manu bad overcalls, when you sell out with the North hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: missing the @DQ they have to diagnose they have extra trump length to compensate|pg||
nt|kirp:  dangerous hand as 5@D makes EW|pg||
nt|glen: in 5@S there is a loser in each suit, and a @H ruff possible|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kirp:  looks like both pairs play some version of Precision @C|pg||
nt|glen: 5-over-5 bids have approximately a 90% chance of being wrong (you should have doubled instead)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jfaria:  routine 4@s 4 those 2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Gerben42:  south hand is known as Bridge World Death Hand (BWDH)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  invitational values with 3-card support for partner|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a nice hand with spade values and N has an easy raise to game with 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has built a trap - will remove to 5 @H, only losing 100 I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is there a reward for "slowest bid hand of the tournament" - without special reason...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello all|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Zaleski needs some results tocach up the playoffs |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with Qxxxx x Axxx xxx North would pass and 4@S would be cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt played the other way round - no spade lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|danilo1: 4@S will make (prob. +1) .. .in ev. 5@D, declarer needs to guess @H (must play 9 from hand) for -2 |pg||
nt|runnerup: very dangerous I wander if 3nt was to play or some minors|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42:  but there is normally no perfect answer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: 10 tricks are on ice here|pg||
nt|roswolf: players names will be up in a mo|pg||
nt|jbgood: going through the motions|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 controls and west will ask for the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks dangerous -all tricks possible|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed 4@s and E might have shown 4@h. I don't know their system :(|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@C could have been made NS|pg||
mc|9|nt|roswolf: didnt bother played his pard for 3+ diamonds or the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D may yhave promised 3+diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @S suit was hidden by N|pg||
pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: one @d too much|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: W likely to guess the trumps but there's still 4 top losers|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|jbgood: the Kanin himself found his @h suit suitable for a 3 bid|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bagman: NS could have made 4@C losing 2 hearts and a diamond|pg||
nt|stc: interesting lead sacrifying a potential trump trick|pg||

nt|roswolf: 10 or 11 tricks operator?|pg||
nt|davpro: there was actually 12 to take (double dummie)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: solid start for the dutch|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good start|pg||
nt|roswolf: a fortuitous start for angelini|pg||
nt|roswolf: hu bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi bill:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: more spice here|pg||
nt|kirp:  1st board is not a nice way to wake up in the match|pg||
nt|kirp:  slam in @Cs available here|pg||
nt|granguru:  6NT 6@s 6@c EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  6NT best contract|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@S worst one|pg||
mb|2S|nt|davpro: 10 point all around. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Peter and Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello|pg||
nt|athene: without the @DA Nunes would likely have led fourth best|pg||
nt|granguru:  do u enter S?|pg||
nt|glen: W might start with Multi if that's available, or a 2@S weak two, or pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with 6/5 and only 1 defencive trick normally better to play in attack|pg||
nt|danilo1: strang - when we look in names here|pg||
nt|granguru:  red vs green?|pg||
nt|glen: N has a flat hand, best to pass, and it make go all pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
mb|d|nt|runnerup: perhaps east should take it away -he has got support in hearts so ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: Angelini seems to be in the A Swiss almost no matter what happens in this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand for n/s to bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: these guys have good nerves,but average players can shake a bit after start like this|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@C relay FG I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: y and Mossop will need a good result to joij them|pg||
nt|roswolf: fulvio has seen his pard's bids before|pg||
nt|glen: *may go|pg||
nt|glen: S is in there with a X, not sure what the next bid would be if N bids 3@D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kirp:  conservative pass by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: *join|pg||
nt|jbgood: 24 vps to Mossop |pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 from each group to A - the others to B|pg||
nt|pelu: hard decision by S - 4@H is down 1 and 5@c also down 1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c looks good|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 5@c making - only defense is @H lead and the @S - kill the entry for the 4. @D|pg||
nt|jfaria:  5! still cheap if opps bid game|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT does well on a @S lead|pg||
nt|glen: not as good on a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  About 12 tricks again - but lucky and only in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jxxx in @D are very much - the double by Versace means balanced hand value in @S - Zaleski can reopen|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Zapadinski is playing at both tables. Could you please check, operator?|pg||
nt|kirp:  not sure it is a relay, artificial and GF yes, now natural|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@s suit 3@C suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  Angelini deciding to bid 4@C passint the 3N barrier|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: kibs rush in to tell me that if defence plays spades 5c cant make|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s finess off so no game on|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like game 1 down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbgood: then 27 from A and 5 from B go on to the KO stage|pg||
nt|davpro: They found a 6-1 fit instead of the 6-0 fit. On level higher though|pg||
nt|pelu: has to take 3x@C befor @D|pg||
nt|kirp:  no blackwood here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eamongall: the non-vul Townsend might venture an insurance 4@Hs |pg||
nt|jbgood: but I think a black suit or even NT play better than @ds|pg||
nt|davpro: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: some sort of short suit trial bid?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|MolvaM: we see all 4 hands but sometimes at the table it is not obvious to shift to spades|pg||
nt|danilo1: 5@C is on ... and good to avoid 4@H, that is tempting in 4-3 fit (single @S on 3-card side)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2@C forcing one round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best lead: @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - NORTH is declarer... - wake up|pg||
nt|pelu: yes defense has to kill @SA|pg||
nt|glen: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda7.html|pg||
nt|glen: top 27 teams in Swiss A, and top 5 in Swiss B play tomorrow|pg||
nt|glen: here we have  25 against  29 in a likely elimination match|pg||
nt|glen: W is thinking, why did my partner play the beer card (@D7)?|pg||
nt|glen: is it because of the beer garden just outside|pg||
nt|glen: it couldn't be fourth best, could it?|pg||
nt|glen: E is thinking, I led fourth best, what's the problem|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: south wont get in much to lead trumps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would also make on the @S-lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead small @S possible but @H equivalent - many use to overcall 1@S in West to give the lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with weak 5332 i agree to pass like Versace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But an overcall would put the contract in South, so...|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing really helps,but contracts should have been by south this time -by n= -if spade lead,but now 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the option between @H and @S lead is a typical problem in bridge|pg||
nt|kirp:  surprise pass by both!|pg||
nt|granguru:  Angelini learns lessons..not passed this time..(as he did once with 10HCP)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eamongall: Now defence need to get active |pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4s has good chances|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
nt|granguru:  Angelini probably showed no first red control a singleton @c support and good @s not more than 5|pg||
nt|kirp:  hard to get to NT played by E, never sure of 7th @C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: with trump Kx inside and clubs 3-3 and the @dK safe|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: and wont necessarily lead one anyway:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - wrong table:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe 2 |pg||
pc|h4|nt|eamongall: still time |pg||
nt|bagman: N has to duck the @HK if W plays a low heart|pg||
nt|bagman: Both N and S know that there are no spade tricks to make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even in the case of a spade shift, stuurman has to be very careful to keep all his diamonds and let his spade honor go|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bridge_one: i prefere to lead in the suit more solid, but without a solid suit i prefere the lead from small cards - but is is only a opinion|pg||
nt|jbgood: NT is more flexible than 3@d|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|bagman: They also see the clubs so they can make extra tricks only from trumps|pg||
nt|glen: spec tells me they may play 3/5 leads|pg||
pc|d6|nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||
nt|kirp:  win 1 imp|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kirp:  ty, thought N would bit it|pg||
nt|granguru:  if 5@H over 5@C there was a chance...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: a stronger defence was diamond lead, heart back, then another diamond|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c3|nt|runnerup: ok inspite off 9 points north desided to pass 3 -right this time -perhaps 3 small trumps and too balanced nd not vulnerable  make that|pg||
nt|kirp:  stopped in 3@S in OR, |pg||
nt|runnerup: no he raised --ok|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jbgood: an imaginative E might bid 3@c then:)|pg||
nt|glen: in which case dropping the beer card on the table was wrong|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|kirp:  N's QJ of @Cs were too good to stop in 3|pg||
nt|runnerup: so -5|pg||
nt|kirp:  in OR, W overcalled, hence any finesse rated to lose|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eamongall: At another table McGann Brown have reached the happy position of having 3 vulnerable doubled undertricks available against 4@S ...they still have to collect them |pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: hi john|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi john|pg||
nt|danilo1: good play .. 2 Dummy entries for (if needed) repeated @H finess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Gerben42:  going plus got to be worth something|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so far +100 is almost worth everything|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if Madala is N then S is Rimstedt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  operator please correct S name?|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: the -50 EW paid is 50 better than the par (4@DX -100); might earn a couple of IMPs|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|bagman: Cannot X and do not like passing |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|rcerreto: yes, me too|pg||

nt|granguru:  1 imp for the overtrick|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@S EW depending on the @DK winning or not.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|kirp:  the polish Club|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2D|nt|jbgood: looks like a peaceful 3 NT by N|pg||
nt|jbgood: or S for that matter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tokay-baldursson at the open room is a very new partnership which might explain why they couldnt find the grand|pg||

mb|p|nt|kirp:  rescue redbld|pg||
nt|granguru:  may have specific types of hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: looks like routine 4@H|pg||

nt|granguru:  2@D = @d+@H|pg||

nt|granguru:  accepting 1NT xx eventually|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: Rimsted clearly gambling with her heart suit|pg||

nt|jfaria:  another routine game|pg||
nt|kirp:  a @H lead is not good for defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  N has 3 trix in the suit|pg||
nt|kirp:  as now S can pass|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|MolvaM: misfit hand but contract seems makable|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible here perhaps|pg||
nt|jfaria:  at least for us looking at 4 hands|pg||
nt|kirp:  this will challenge N in the play|pg||
nt|granguru:  took his time |pg||
nt|jbgood: but again - this prdship is not of very firm construction - so ....|pg||
nt|granguru:  he "knew" S was going to say 2@d|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|athene: 6@S would not be great here even with the @D9|pg||
nt|kirp:  @Ds are sitting wrong or maybe right given lack of entries to N|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|athene: the point being, on a club lead, you have to draw trumps and then cash four hearts to discard a club from the north hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: they might go down here|pg||
nt|glen: declarer knows where the @S ace, but where is the @S jack|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: the first non-alert after 3 rounds of bidding :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: N should know that the @c king counts for full - and bid 3 imo|pg||
nt|kirp:  S is happy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|davpro: They stopped low, but if @ds are not 3-3 a higher contract would be a struggle|pg||
nt|kirp:  now N has a problem|pg||
nt|granguru:  a terrible contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: W will not be|pg||
nt|kirp:  100 a trick|pg||
nt|kirp:  i make down 3|pg||
nt|granguru:  1@s 2@h 2@D 1@c|pg||
nt|granguru:  but may be only -2|pg||
nt|jbgood: E should ask himself why E didnt jump in hearts (or bid them directly) - because he had 2 suits:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  not easy lead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|danilo1: @CQ lead may create some playing options ... cashing 2 @H immediatelly may be loosing option|pg||
nt|granguru:  if @c help to discard|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru:  now -2 as said|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: although the bidding thus far is cloaked in mystery they seem to be powering into it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42:  with a bit more fortune it would have been a claimer|pg||
nt|bagman: In pairs it might not be that practical as the bonus for the game is not that big as in teams|pg||
nt|granguru:  no no|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  S ruffs @cq but loses a natural trump trick |pg||
nt|granguru:  no fast entry in S hand to cross @D|pg||
nt|glen: odds are still the 1NT bidder has it, so he picks up the trump suit|pg||
nt|glen: E can win this or the next to switch to @Ds for his ruff|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duck this @D could be a idea|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gives the same result, if South plays safe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but give at south the chance to fault|pg||
nt|danilo1: well done|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: 4@S MIGHT BE FINIS|pg||
nt|roswolf: and it is not sure what happened there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at the other table, tokay asked for keycards and then asked for the trump queen apparently. why??|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Absolutely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on the previous board|pg||
nt|athene: actually i guess it would be ok (provided the hearts come in)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jbgood: 27 teams from A and 5 from B go to the KO stage - with no carry over|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye is used to playing tough contracts - but most often there is a glimmer of hope to win:) not so here|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|pelu: the @D-lead gave S a fine tempo|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kirp:  that looks like 6 trix for declarer|pg||
nt|granguru:  19 teams are playing for Poland|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west was somewhat stuck for a good lead|pg||
nt|pelu: 110 = 9 IMP for Monaco|pg||
nt|runnerup: trying to help parner well done -now surely down|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jfaria:  claim is near|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: strange - these guys tend to bid 3 NT on most game hands|pg||
nt|bagman: If 2@D was FG, N might have tried 2NT on 2@S to see the reaction|pg||
nt|jbgood: i thin N should bid 2 NT over 2@s - and not 3@s|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry Pekka |pg||
pc|hT|nt|rcerreto: I think that S, with 3-5-1-4 would have bid 2@s over 1@s with a minimum hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|stc: W must open @c now|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 2@s is therefore likely a doubleton|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|rcerreto: then, yes 2NT would be more appealing than 3@s|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|stc: if not dec may come home loosing only A@h and 2@s|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: Declarer hoping that the ruff was with a trump trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps not|pg||
nt|jbgood: Kanin won the first 3 boards - all may be lost on this one|pg||
nt|stc: but E must play a trumpo after the next @h ruff|pg||
nt|stc: of course dec may draw trump now and go down$|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|cJ|nt|stc: good move|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|stc: now TRUMP !|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer still needs a parking place for two diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|stc: right, and ruffind with  the Q@s gives defense the setting trick|pg||

nt|davpro: So, with less and 3-4-1-5 distibution he would always pass?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zmud has 5-5 reds again|pg||
nt|MolvaM: anyway...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: another lively hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: another freakish deal|pg||
nt|athene: west isn't quite worth 2@H i think in their style|pg||
nt|kirp:  that was down 1, wasnt it|pg||
nt|kirp:  it went down 2, so S led a @D back and squeezed pard|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@h is max|pg||
nt|jfaria:  slam zone|pg||
nt|kirp:  VG, need to fix score on 23|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes -i think so too --this 3nt must be played by east or 5 loosers can come up|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  7@S in the OR|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bridge_one: same defence in other room |pg||
nt|athene: their 2-level openers are 10-13 and only really, really huge 9-counts qualify|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed not now here come the fireworks|pg||
nt|athene: in third seat, of course, things are relaxed a bit... :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Is E's dble penalties?|pg||
nt|kirp:  7@S or 6@Ds|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: north will lebensohl his way to 3@H i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: can west rdbl for blood here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H is limited at 9 hcp 3 cards raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3rd slam hand in a row?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  better in @d|pg||
nt|danilo1: if ev. 6@S ... @C lead or @H and @C switch may be vital|pg||
nt|danilo1: *is vital for defense|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... rite contract (unbeatable) is not 6@S ... but 6@D ... guess difficult to come there |pg||
nt|runnerup: so double for takeout -problems in bidding by west perhaps|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure well bid to get to the grand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|runnerup: you have to guess well to make 4 @h -but that is bedt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A poor 4 @H - but you might be forced to "guess" right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East is evaluating what bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: this @d lead asked may help to get rid off spade looser|pg||
nt|jbgood: choice between dbl and 1 NT...|pg||
nt|jbgood: pass never an option for Boye on a near opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: lebensohl is heading n/s into danger here|pg||
nt|athene: well, whether he can or not, he didn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will leap high|pg||
nt|MolvaM: leader board and running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: but is it high enough|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you redouble in these auctions you help opps because they now have more room to scramble for the best fit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: but defense may start with 3 spades and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where south needs discipline|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW play a strong @C, so this shows points|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: not any more|pg||
nt|davpro: 8 quick tricks for defense here on a spade lead. 7 for declarer on that lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 7 th in the bag|pg||
nt|athene: also you warn them with borderline hands to stay low|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S WHATEVER IT MEANS SEEM OVER THE TOP - WEST SHAPENS HIS AXE|pg||
nt|athene: so here for example if west had redoubled, south might well have decided his partner didn't have what was needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: sharpens|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@c must be @d |pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: lets see if they can locate the missing @d control|pg||
nt|roswolf: they should do|pg||
nt|roswolf: the flexible double|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch is comming|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer needs to ruff the heart losers and discard a club on a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  UNDO|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade honors not so attractive for madala|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well be passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has nothing to cue and has soft club values|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kirp:  I think pass followed ny pass or 3N would have been better bid by E|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: they dont have a lot of hcp to spare|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR NS in 6@H - looks like S gave a false cue bid in @D - but it was an artifical bidding over 6 round|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow thats enterprising|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the italians are merciful|pg||
nt|kirp:  not well bid here|pg||
nt|kirp:  thought this was a strong club auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: most pairs have bid to 7 - but a few rested in six, and even fewer in game|pg||
nt|glen: this lead will not trouble declarer too much|pg||
pc|c8|nt|MolvaM: in another table north could go with J2N and that might be a problem|pg||
nt|danilo1: exactelly ... if Alfredo decides to try more than 4@S ... he will not bid Diamonds :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I believe 4@C was just cue|pg||
nt|jfaria:  456 kibs tell me 4@c is just a cue |pg||
nt|jfaria:  being a cue, no way to reach @d :(|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Not likely as we only have 285 here|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told they are in slam in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he still likes his hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  just a figure of speach :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: NS have done very well to enter bidding ... if South pass, EW would have time to find @D |pg||
pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: well even if diamonds are not led. no way to get rid of the 2 losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: and that is enough for norberto:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does 4s have any specific meaning?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just an old fashioned cue?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|runnerup: no fight now just posible over tricks |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i want to bid on and i have a spade control|pg||
nt|roswolf: the latter|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems an easy-ish make|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bagman: The @DA must be with E: if W has it, then E has the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But how can you play bridge - NOT leading partners suit with Ace-x???|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You MUST have seen too many bad overcalls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: try both finesses and hope that the @d10 takes care of itself|pg||
nt|roswolf: the pass of 4@S said dont lead one i am told:) so he follows his own suggestion:)|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Glen Ashton|pg||
nt|glen: hi|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hard to tell probably Lauria would treat is hand as single suited..|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|pelu: very controles bidding here|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe enough here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's concern on a diamond shift is whether to finesse the @C9|pg||
nt|roswolf: now off|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: but i don't think he will|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Happy Christmas now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: push hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks srange but no spade losers went away |pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps has been a better idea to pass and wait for partners d --but ofcause partner can pass too -but if y double partner never bids nt -because you have all spades|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|glen: now careful not to use the @S Queen too early|pg||
nt|glen: 3@S + 2@H + 2@C + 2@D = making|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: as suggested Angeline bid and made 3 NT on the previous one|pg||
pc|c6|nt|MolvaM: I wont lead one :)|pg||
nt|athene: he might be considering whether to try to make the contract by playing east for the @HK|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but east's double is a warning|pg||
nt|danilo1: as I said before ... on Bd 12 - 4@H in 4-3 fit has been very tempting ... happened in OR - and 12 IMP for Allfrey|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Glen|pg||
nt|glen: hi Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade best for defense now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|jbgood: strange that N didnt try a big spade first...|pg||
nt|roswolf: draw trumps and take the diamonf hook|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can pull trumps and discard diamonds on clubs to ruff out the king|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which also works|pg||

nt|bagman: NS can make a minor suit slam|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe EW have some Namyats type of device over 1m openings|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3N-2 was only worth 20%|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  last round not finished yet?|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can show real clubs, S hand becomes very valuable with the source of tricks, heart control and trump support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if it starts 1@C 4@H, what does S bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4NT perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: but E has a hand where she can prevent NS from changing that information. After 1@C, E can bid 4@H and then?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. tough if 1@C can be short (3 or even 2 cards)|pg||
nt|bagman: if 4NT shows primary diamonds and secondary clubs then it's the bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the problem with such a bid is - what will pd think it is|pg||
nt|bagman: I wouldn't be surprised if there are some other agreements for the meaning of 4NT|pg||
nt|bagman: or no agreements :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is an area where regular partnerships are ahead of the game|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@HX is 500; it's better than the vulnerable game for EW so they might take the sac|pg||
nt|runnerup: 11 in both tables and we though how to make 10|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me slam makable if no @d lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well if you can duck a diamond and then squeeze somebody afterwards :) maybe|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not sure if this play was superior|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: for running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: south could make 6 of a red suit here if only he could get to dummy twice (lead the @H7 picks the suit up)|pg||
nt|roswolf: there will be some fun and games here|pg||
nt|athene: sorry - of course he can do it|pg||
nt|athene: lead to @SA, and lead the small heart|pg||
nt|athene: then later get to dummy with a heart and lead a diamond to the queen|pg||
nt|athene: easy!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm perhaps not at the table -in the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: only needs east to have @HHx and @DKx|pg||
nt|roswolf: game not reached at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: hampson-greco playing precision so 1@D is nebulous|pg||
nt|athene: south can be very aggressive if he knows his partner actually has some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but not when it might just be two small|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed these kind of hands are horrible for strong club systems|pg||
nt|roswolf: or less bill|pg||
nt|athene: well it's at least a doubleton for them i think; they use 2@D for the short diamond hands|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: Nunes call director|pg||
nt|roswolf: short of bds!?or something wrong with the last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: becouse 2nt invit or forsing |pg||
nt|athene: hmmm - they are not happy about something from the previous board, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: ah - you mean nunes was told that 2NT was showing a good hand and that is why he didn't double?|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is anothe swing possibility|pg||
nt|danilo1: meant 6@D (@S)|pg||
nt|kirp:  score is really 25-10|pg||
nt|granguru:  a very expensive hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  which will most probably decide the winner of the match |pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  something to be said for 5@H overcall too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in 4@H in other match one made one down|pg||

nt|runnerup: ns has a good score open room ew has some 2h to make|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|MolvaM: if trumps were 3-1 he would have to fall back on the @d hook|pg||
nt|granguru:  1 NT 13-15|pg||
nt|glen: that was 10 imps, bring this "elimination" match to a near tie|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: against a strong 1@C 5@H would be fine|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt also,but ew can bid more|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|roswolf: 4@S here is the likely spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart partial would be sensible|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 5@D can be beated with @S lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: no just loose that|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|runnerup: small from table |pg||
nt|jbgood: some lucky day you make 6 @s on this lot - but not today|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt now? :) - he does have seven stoppers in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: the diamond suit now consigned to the dustbin|pg||
nt|athene: i bet a lot of partnerships don't know what a jump in 4th suit means|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. 3@D here - is that natural forcing, natural non-forcing, or what?|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is wrong with a natural 1@D RESPONSE?|pg||
nt|glen: peaceful 4@h here|pg||
nt|danilo1: NS need to stop on time (5@H still on time) ... ev. 4@S or 5@D by EW will be too expensive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3@d ends any slam mess in N/S intentions|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  should make this for push|pg||
nt|runnerup: true ew can not tough clubs so looser gous so @s later|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: south is sensible|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west also :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would have been interesting to watch 3@dX|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever bids a strong 7-card minor if they have a major of any description|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: after pass at 5@C @S lead became possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lightner...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S ruff, K @C - declarer lose the ruff, one @C and A@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup he had the colors to help him|pg||
nt|athene: i think officially in SAYC a jump in 4th suit is defined as natural and invitational|pg||
nt|glen: ok, a quiet 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: ok wrong hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No right hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many pair use pass at 5@C like OK to lead @C, instead DBL means to lead in another suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i don't know the gadget played by E/W|pg||
nt|jbgood: investigating for a club contract (slam?) and got no reaction of a positive kind |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: so it was all academical|pg||
nt|glen: 1@H likely a transfer to @S, 1NT may have denied 3+@Ss|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you are going to play transfer advances, i think you have to open west hand with 1@D (polish+walsh style)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: Malinowski has very little defense and can hope that they go down only 3|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of those dark corners that no-one knows about|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1-5-7-0 will not be an obvious shape to the defenders|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is close however since singleton spade is an honour|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: @SK to the ace, diamond finesse i guess|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess will not miss the jead after bidding :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  this should make 5, for no swing|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bridge_one: now np|pg||
nt|MolvaM: trump lead effective stop a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni might stick the @DK in|pg||
nt|roswolf: but north made a normal if aggressive raise to the vul game|pg||
nt|danilo1: *lead|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs - if u know EW-bidding then help us :)|pg||
nt|glen: the Qx of @C here is a help to 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the spade lead from north is strange however|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: Good time to take the save; in pairs taking an 800 save against a making slam is not a way to win; normally you should take your chances and try to beat the slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: @d cue was what S did NOT want to get|pg||
nt|granguru:  last hand N knowing p had 4@s cards misvalued his hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|davpro: But from Ns view; doesn't it seem as if S hasn't got a @h cue?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: now declarer is worried the @DQ might get ruffed, so he would like to lead a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: but entries are a bit on the short side|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: N looks to take no notice...|pg||
nt|jbgood: S bid well - N somewhat undiciplined - slam is more like a Roland one (which in the old days would be called a Norwegian slam)|pg||
nt|kirp:  q@C next?|pg||
nt|kirp:  knows S has another @S, so needs to take out entry|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|davpro: This could take a while, but will end with 1 down...|pg||
nt|jbgood: If N has the @c Q in stead of the @d Q his hand would be better though|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bagman: (unless the slam is such that everybody bids and makes it)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: when you have a hand like south's, your worst nightmare is getting forced, losing trump control|pg||
nt|glen: spec notes this board played in 6@D by Lavazza, and is also 6@D by Kamras|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|MolvaM: 2 slams equalized the score|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|glen: Kamras made 6@D, thanks to Qx of @Cs, how about Lavazza?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|jbgood: another swing for Angelini i reckon|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: W might pass and take the money|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbgood: may go all pass - not often spades behave after the preempt|pg||
nt|stc: not much money to take|pg||
nt|bagman: Sometimes partner is 5-1-3-4 and spades break badly|pg||
nt|rcerreto: should he?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: +300 wouldn't be a large reward|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|stc: for me pass is not an option|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: W should bid if he would be sure to bid to the best contract; if he cannot be sure, he might be changing decent plus to minus|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rcerreto: point is: what is "decent"?|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm not recommending pass; I'm just suggesting it as an option|pg||
nt|rcerreto: let S have 8@h as he could have|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|bagman: 300 would be decent against -100|pg||

mb|1S|nt|MolvaM: 2d alerted?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yeah @D:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok means no 4 card spades|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: 3@H for N/S and 3@S for E/W here|pg||
nt|runnerup: may end for double partscore swing|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks kibs|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they use 1NT to show 4 spades +a longer minor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Im told zmud-bal play the raptor convention |pg||
nt|roswolf: west has an automatic 4@S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe invented by a mr raptor? :)|pg||
nt|pelu: par-contract is 6@d - 5@s and 5@d making|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west thinks abt how many spades to bid?|pg||
nt|pelu: red against green 4@S is fine|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s comphrensively outbid the americans on the last one|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes better actually -was down anyway |pg||
nt|kirp:  this is all str @C, negative 1@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H open probably 10/12 constructive (and 2@D multi)|pg||
nt|davpro: When preempting with 3 in a minor you normally do not have a 4 card major. Nothing said about 5 card suits :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: even on 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hehe|pg||
nt|roswolf: DBL presumably just shows cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gy Szalay|pg||
nt|szalay:  hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: and here a thin 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@D can be alternate suits that is @D+@S|pg||
nt|granguru:  more @d |pg||
nt|granguru:  S knows finesse is not working. can establish @C but no fast entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  to throw @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: well now judgment comes into it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 level belongs to the opps :)|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to decide on 5-level|pg||
nt|roswolf: south tempted to bid 6?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zmud cant be sure of void spades so will probably pass|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C natural (ish), strong (ish) and forcing|pg||
nt|szalay:  N-S are a rare pair from Hungary: they r not from Budapest|pg||
nt|szalay:  from our Sun City, Szeged, and could improve a lot thx to BBO|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Are you saying people don't play bridge outside Budapest?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: for sure W cant bid 5@s - but I have been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@S looks like a strange bid?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bagman: Having showed 44 majors and getting no reaction from partner, W could show his 3 card support expecting to be in a decent trump suit|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s will prevail |pg||
nt|runnerup: strange bidding to worse game but mames now|pg||
nt|kirp:  strangely enuff, its cold|pg||
nt|kirp:  now with the lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  play 3 trumps, then finesse in @Cs for @D pitch|pg||
nt|kirp:  good bid by E!!!|pg||
nt|kirp:  S is wondering how to keep down undertrix|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: If anybody is following a pair you can find their probable table from the following |pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye may lead a club now and get a plus score ag 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it was the @C position which influenced him more|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much to the play the club ace is right or it isnt:)|pg||
nt|athene: if west invites, east might bid it on the strength of the good club suit, even though he is minimum in terms of hcp|pg||
nt|szalay:  not really, they r from Szeged and few pairs from Pecs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: S wants to compete but the majors are behind her so she gives up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@C help ,,, opps |pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay:  Hungary is more or less Budapest orientated, bridge is even centralized|pg||
nt|athene: difficult lead problem for south|pg||
nt|glen: should be three aces and a trump|pg||
nt|runnerup: in other table declarer took advantise off that same lead to put @d looser away ,but lost control because 4-1 and K -offside in @h contract|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S works well here on the 3-3 @S breat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rather tame bidding|pg||
nt|glen: break|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: OK|pg||
nt|roswolf: the clubs can of course be set up here for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H - 4@D - 4@S - 5@D and 51S by Helgemo!|pg||
nt|pelu: 15 INP to Monaco |pg||
nt|MolvaM: no so easy if east ducks|pg||
nt|athene: north could have made life easier, perhaps, by doubling 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: but he finds the heart anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: some play a double of these transfer responses as some sort of takeout double anyway|pg||
nt|athene: for example after nebulous 1@C - 1@H [spades], X = diamonds and hearts, and 1@S = clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|athene: but without special agreements of that sort i would have thought double would just be hearts and 1@S would be takeout, the same as after a transfer over 1nt|pg||
nt|szalay:  Mr. Zsak is teacher of Szeged bridge, he was teacher of Mr. Cseho of other table when he attended Faculty of Medicine there. as u know: he is my psychiatrist:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  unless E thinks playing for a simple @H finesse is better option!|pg||
nt|granguru:  a deceptive move|pg||
nt|glen: now Benito might or might not lead his singleton @D here|pg||
nt|glen: @D lead, A, @D ruff, @H to the Q, and rats, that's ruffed!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: his rule is a bit too rigid to be the absolute truth|pg||
nt|glen: we were out in the beer garden when the TD came by to get us all back in this match|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru:  but defense is obvious|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: even 6@h a good save over 4@s:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: spade ace and a club takes it 1 down|pg||
nt|davpro: Defense better take their tricks at once...|pg||
nt|danilo1: 140 I believe|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jbgood: north really bid his hand to the limit:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27 teams from group-A will qualify for the knockouts. and 5 teams from group-B|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might try ducking in dummy and dropping the @H10 to induce north to lay down the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: but that would only work if south would lead the @H9 from @H9xx|pg||
nt|szalay:  as u know: we, Hungarians try to avoid D lead vs NT|pg||
nt|athene: D = doubleton or diamond?|pg||
nt|szalay:  diamond|pg||
pc|d3|nt|MolvaM: 15 how? 5s cant be made I think|pg||
nt|jfaria:  peacefull partscore|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eamongall: We are covering tables 8-15 as shown  on the results web page ... so the bottom 8 lines are tables H G F E A B C D in that order |pg||
nt|jbgood: @s 6 for a club now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jbgood: Boye should be able to read that|pg||
nt|roswolf: and probably on this layout so can 6@D|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't untangle his black suits here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|szalay:  Diamonds for girls, u know|pg||

pc|h8|nt|eamongall: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
pc|s9|nt|davpro: E could hold 764 from W view|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|runnerup: some creek gift so to say|pg||
nt|glen: did declarer really skate to dummy to play another @H?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kirp:  8 trix|pg||
nt|granguru:  1 TRICK...SUCCESS|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eamongall: this is table 13 of 15 in play tables and 3rd line from bottom of scoresheet |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: but difficult to think that prd has 5 spades (and a @c void...)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: if he unblocks the @SAK he can't get to his clubs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: sorry 5@S down 1 - so only 7 IMP|pg||
nt|szalay:  time for hoping up|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can all see @DK, heart gets the job done|pg||
nt|athene: but not so easy for south|pg||
nt|szalay:  I dont see any layout when small is the correct card|pg||
nt|athene: his partner might have singleton @DQ for example|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed not|pg||
nt|szalay:  he knows pd's cards|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bagman: Now E can ruff the diamond and try the heart to the K|pg||
nt|eamongall: Most pairs move to the table of the pair below them next ... ie 12 goes where 11 used to be |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: no - then the 7 for his known strenth|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|glen: interesting line, requires N to have two or less @Hs, and @D ace|pg||
nt|glen: if will cash @S ace here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but what does it gain against|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: well THE RESULT IN THE OTHER ROOM SPEAKS FOT ITSELF|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: amazingly 5s was made. cant see how|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the 2NT bid denied four diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: nobody would give style points for this defense|pg||
pc|hT|nt|szalay:  and dummy play is a hint as well|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bagman: The heart attempt is likely to fail as N has shown @DA and @CK already|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|szalay:  nice defence, anyway|pg||
pc|d7|nt|glen: it gains against boredom|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bagman: but there was nothing better to try|pg||
nt|athene: if so, that is another example of how much easier you make life for the defence when you tell them exactly what declarer has|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
nt|glen: now bonus trump trick possible|pg||
pc|h6|nt|davpro: From declarer view E has got 2+@c, so @c to T is the only thing that might work|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bagman: NS currently the 7th; EW about that much from the bottom|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: J @H A K and @C would discard a @D over the good @C in the dummy|pg||

nt|runnerup: ok this if any must be 3nt all around ,but I have learned not to say it aloud,because something not so normal seems to happen somewhere in all boards |pg||
mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: 4@S correct bid !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well that was a bit of a careless defence I thk|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the spade overcall|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well the alternative is also not attractive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@d says nothing about @h i presume, just shows fit/short|pg||
nt|glen: N's pass would be forcing for most, after the 4@D shortness bid|pg||
nt|glen: now S has to decide if his hand is gold, or straw|pg||
nt|glen: W cuebids and now that lets N show @H support|pg||
nt|glen: if W had bid 4@S, N would have a choice of bidding or passing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 5@s made on the unfortunate lead of the @c ace next door|pg||
nt|jbgood: doubled to boot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: transfer to spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H|pg||
nt|szalay:  I doubt anyone could miss a game here|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@S denies 4 @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: north has not found hearts obfiously -so svedish increasing lead perhaps|pg||
nt|jfaria:  depending on agreement|pg||
nt|danilo1: Gold may see @C shortness ... and bid 5@S ... however, not easy choice ...|pg||
nt|kirp:  my explanations are all hypothetical here, have no idea what Poles are actually playing|pg||
nt|glen: wow, S lets 4@S by with a 6-5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bagman: E doesn't want to lead from her collection|pg||
nt|bagman: Every card might be right or wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: but lavazza may suffer in the end|pg||
nt|szalay:  and I wd like to be in 4S, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: most bid more than 1@S with four-card support but i am sure they will unravel it all|pg||
nt|roswolf: OH I COULD VERY EASILY:) |pg||
nt|szalay:  this game about vulnerable bonuses, more or less|pg||
nt|roswolf: might not be good play but.....|pg||
nt|danilo1: correct action - hand looks like double fits|pg||
nt|kirp:  I guess 2@Cs EW can be held to 4 trix|pg||
nt|jbgood: nunes might have won it - but forgot to pull trumps, and opps got a @d ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends how you interpret the double, does it invite a sac, i think so|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: well a simple 4@S on this one|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but congrats geoffrey for yr prediction powers|pg||
nt|jfaria:  that is a nice discussion about ownership of the hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|szalay:  bridge wd be a very boring game if we could bid seen by both hands|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|MolvaM: u sensed that defence coming and predicted 5s making  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is cheeky|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wasnt a very scientific sequence|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but effective apparently|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like he will establish the 5th heart|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes methinks he is very lucky|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is the legitimate downer lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  problem is what to do with @D if you take 3 round of trumps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: easy game here - time to go for coffee :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but go fast :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: here is the running scores and current ranking http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|kirp:  ruff a spade and 3 rounds of trumps and hope something good happens |pg||
pc|d7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kirp:  oops|pg||
nt|glen: 2@Cs and a @D only, and this makes|pg||
pc|s8|nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||
nt|roswolf: you need to qualify for SWISS A then:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|szalay:  I predict 3 imps for Angelini|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|danilo1: Bd 14 - peacefull 4@S in OR too ... so no swing|pg||
nt|glen: versace not cooperating|pg||
nt|glen: he will only win third @S play|pg||
pc|s7|nt|MolvaM: goes for the crossruff|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  Trump-lead, North then ducked the @D...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kirp:  not sure why that @S play|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: i oncerad a statistic -if after a normal opening bid you bid game whenever you are vul you gain on average 8+ imps unless your opps double 66% of the time!: i doubted those stats ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: at the time but i am getting more convinced the more i play/watch the game|pg||
nt|roswolf: once read|pg||
nt|granguru:  for that you must end in summy and play @D to the Q ..if E takes you repeat the process|pg||
nt|jbgood: no need - Boye never got his @d ruff - I really wonder why|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ohh|pg||
nt|szalay:  if u watch (and especially play) more, u know more:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  declarer may only take 9 trix here.|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems to have +1 in any case anyway |pg||
nt|kirp:  he does but does not know @Ds dont run|pg||
nt|kirp:  may not take @C finesse as not necessary!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|danilo1: danger is too loose trump control ... or to loose @C trick ... probably -1 as will try 3 @H in West|pg||
nt|kirp:  its easy here but ruffing the spade before last trump puts you in dummy for a @D lead|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
mc|10|nt|granguru:  12 imps for Mirage|pg||
nt|kirp:  a true mirage|pg||
nt|granguru:  now up 22-18|pg||
nt|kirp:  for E|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bagman: Standard Polish doctrine to open the 5 card major with the 6-5|pg||
nt|stc: as long as the partnedr plays the same :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Zaremba in a nasty situation; may go for Hamman rule|pg||
nt|bagman: which is bid 3NT if it's an option|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: 16. S claimed -2|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|jbgood: lots of people play a minor opening denying a 5 bagger in a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: sry, did not notice he had spade support|pg||
nt|rcerreto: maybe he forgot to be in 5|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: unless very good|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|rcerreto: at th end of the match, result of board 16 could change|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bagman: Declarer in danger of going down if N has Tx of spades and doubleton diamond unless draws trumps|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphpld: fast claim:)|pg||
nt|bagman: with trumps 3-2, no problem in the play|pg||
pg||

mb|2S!|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bagman: He might go down with trumps 3-2 if he tried to guard against 4-1 in North|pg||
nt|bagman: so I think he played it right|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rcerreto: that's the point, you can't win both situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: another fast claim|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|rcerreto: an overruff by 10x looks more likely that @s 4-1 in N|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: 500 registered in the current scores on   16 - so we take it that that was the result - as we thought|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ok, thanks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bagman: And he might survive 4-1 with AK of spades and later being able to play a spade up if N had only 4 clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: so 4 imps on   16 - and not 8|pg||

nt|rcerreto: another no-brainer coming?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|bagman: NS likely to find the spade game and lose 3 tricks|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bagman: I don't think that the willingness to play 3NT applies to this hand|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: they found the spade fit:)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: usually better to play from the strong hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rcerreto: this time makes no difference|pg||
nt|jbgood: puppet stayman would lead to the contract being strong hand sided|pg||
nt|stc: Kanin on the way to the needed win|pg||
nt|rcerreto: maybe but we'll never know :)|pg||
nt|bagman: rehi|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: is problem with internet...|pg||
nt|bagman: Are they still playing this?|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if they will be among the 27 with a draw|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: but a 14 imps victory would surely see them safe into the KO stage|pg||
