pc|cK|nt|hedyg: and i strongly dislike leading from a doubleton if pd didnt bid the suit|pg||

nt|granguru:  nice deception|pg||
nt|dburn: then, he could have reached a position where he threw a diamond on the king of spades, and another on the eight|pg||
nt|dburn: and another on the ruff and discard that West would have had to give him|pg||

pc|s7|nt|pelu: but down 1 on @D-ruff|pg||

nt|athene: south obviously felt that he had shown his hand already with 3@C|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Sure, the ruff is unavoidable|pg||
nt|athene: at MP you would be much less happy about passing 3@S because one or even two down is no use if you can make a partscore your way|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 27+5 = 32 teams will qualify for the knockouts. members of the eliminated teams can enjoy the open pairs event starting tomorrow|pg||

nt|roswolf: is that supposed to be a rubbish multi?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= multi, 2M= 10-13|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl =diamonds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so this is max 9 hcps|pg||
nt|dburn: well, rubbish is as rubbish goes - that's pretty sound, not vulnerable in first seat|pg||
nt|hedyg: i never consider a 6-4 hand as rubbish anyhow|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok bid your suit is the consensus for rdbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass would show @ds, not XX|pg||
nt|dburn: but I would be surprised to find that redouble showed diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: some play that redoubled means "I don't want to compete" - they would bid 2@s to mean "I want to compete in hearts, but not spades"|pg||
nt|roswolf: americans have a marked weakness against the multi -i t is extremely discouraged in the state|pg||
nt|3for3: that is how we play the redouble.  not sure it is best. since they are often in trouble when they enter with balanced garbage|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is no carryover to the round of 32|pg||
nt|roswolf: you would hope meckwell at least have sensible methods|pg||
nt|3for3: they do play sensible methods.  but doubling 2@D is not free, especially when the partner of the multi has some diamond length|pg||
nt|hedyg: to pass with @ds is normal i believe as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 6+ @ds|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would ignore the rdbl and bid 3@C SHOWING VALUES + clubs(going via leb would be weaker)|pg||
nt|3for3: meck usually isnt this slow|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm is south choosing between 3@C OR 4@c?|pg||
nt|dburn: he may be asking questions of West, of course|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|woozle: 6NT has chances with a spade lead - four spades, three hearts, three diamonds, one club and a squeeze on south|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but ns might get busy in h|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s was intermediate?|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs tell me XX used to be bid your major  for EW|pg||
nt|3for3: it might be west who is thinking, but i doubt it.|pg||
nt|3for3: usually these auctions are fairly automatic for the multi side.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i had assumed that rodwell's dbl showed 12-15 bal or very strong -does anyone know for sure?|pg||
nt|dburn: doesn't look as though redouble was diamonds, at any rate - West would have bid if it did|pg||
nt|3for3: i would bet with you |pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ntmon: but higher suit probably wins|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3@c was obviously value-showing, given North's 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Fiona Brown is very cautious with her barren 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive reopening by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 10-13 I am told ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: some may have doubled as east-t/o of course|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or 11-13 I am also told  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@C here on ice|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no CC for NS, soemthing between SEF and 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6nt from east cold as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not yet|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead 4th from longest!|pg||
nt|dburn: and I suppose he might make it, if East doesn't lead a diamond|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|3for3: 3nt is reasonable spot. the diamond stopper looks weak, but as long as the clubs run, you just need AK@D in one hand or no @D lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|3for3: they got the latter...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ntmon: .. now :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wikner/Kamras: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJK1.pdf|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: this may not play too well|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|woozle: four rounds of spades now will put South through the wringer|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi knows his side has a fit - if opps have a 9-card fit you are guaranteed an 8-card fit at least - but that doesn't mean you will find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might bid 4@S with the W hand once he knows about 4 card support since he has no valid defense vs 4@H except the trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can be defeated|pg||
nt|roswolf: the swedes on the first bd bid to 5@D for a game swing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|blum1956: A player of the team which is in best 8 will hardly lead a spade against 6NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the bidding could well go 1@s-2@s-4@S at other tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have seen it said that at expert level you should never lead pard's major but lead your own suit and this hand is a good example of why|pg||
mc|9|nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called by Upmark|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he called TD cause 3NT was bid after a longgggggg huddle by S|pg||
nt|3for3: does the slow bid demonstrably suggest 3nt by Rodwell?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the TD will decide that|pg||
nt|roswolf: in my view yes 3nt is much safer when pard huddles|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time i had received some messages from kibs about the 3NT bid after a long huddle|pg||
nt|3for3: it may be safer.  but it needs to be DEMONSTRABLY suggested...the law's words, not mine|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it again looks that americans cant deal with the multi:)|pg||
nt|dburn: no more than an in-tempo 3@c bid would, I imagine - but we are not the Director, of course|pg||

nt|athene: many players seem to double rather than bidding 1nt quite often|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|athene: here east maybe thinks he has not enough playing strength - or maybe they play 1nt to show 5 diamonds and a 4 card major|pg||

nt|MolvaM: so that 4@s wont make|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|woozle: Brown has an exciting hand but best defense can beat 4S|pg||

nt|roswolf: another transfer|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: anothr transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: might inhibit the nat @H overcall by east |pg||
nt|3for3: 2@H reverse flannery|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: South's 2D looks competitively inadequate, not that it matters much here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tempting|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|blum1956: Probably it is a @h raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: may be showing 3@H support - the transfer shows 4+ in hearts|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: i would lead a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: the @SQ is looking for a brillancy prize|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: but it depends on what double by eric showed - if a weak nt then it may well be assuming a club fit - but we must remember that defence could have defeated it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H not alerted?|pg||
nt|wstuart: sleeping actually|pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: No doubt, and a toothpick is a weapon but it's not really adequate for a duel|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: but resisted|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told 1@c-1@d-1@h=3@h unball,1nt=2/3@hball|pg||
nt|roswolf: another vul game bash|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1st we bid it, then we try to make it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ntmon: S would need @D8 instead of @D7|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: to try and set up hearts looks natural not that it will work|pg||
nt|hedyg: not enough transportation|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also the 3rd @s in the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but if 3-3 then enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: if there is a way Pepsi will find it|pg||
nt|roswolf: dd it is doomed i am told - looks it to me in practice as well|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c4|nt|athene: this is a funny auction then - how did Bocchi know his partner had five hearts>|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcarroll: making now|pg||
nt|woozle: Brown had two options - lead the club early before the opponents know you have eight trumps, or run trumps and try to put on pressure|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|ntmon: or @D lead|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he didn't|pg||
mc|9|nt|blum1956: Maybe it were better to play the @cQ before trumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: so 11 for Mahaffey|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: 1nt definitely an option for south with the relatively weak hearts|pg||
nt|athene: now north can pass happily if it's forcing|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not at all clear|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: south might just have very good hearts and nothing else and be about to pass 2@C out|pg||

nt|roswolf: what 3@H would mean is a mystery:)|pg||
nt|athene: ok so with a 3nt bid and only four hearts, south would have done something else|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo responds 2@C on strong balanced hands with a 4-card major|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is to conceal the major if you don't have a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|athene: so if you respond showing a major then bid 3nt you promise 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: another kibber suggests they may use 3@S rebid by south as puppet to 3nt|pg||

nt|dburn: delay perhaps caused by return of Director to table|pg||
nt|3for3: south made an interesting pass of the double of 1@H in CR.  Terrible heart spots.  I'd have bid some number of NT myself|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: They will talk with TD after the match |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: we would be happy if a few voids would be there but ok :)|pg||
nt|glen: on bd 22, Tokay, S in other room, started trumps with ace for +140 and 5 imps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: 3C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S alerted but looks like sign-off|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 22 in 3@S DECLARER DID PLAY ACE AND ANOR TRUMP|pg||
nt|MolvaM: welldone tokay :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: great minds eh glen!?:)|pg||
nt|glen: hey, canadians own "eh"|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3nt seems routine by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: boy what happens now|pg||
nt|ntmon: when opps bid 2 suits and we look for 3NT, we bid the suit we have stopped |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 4+|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult salm to reach 6@D seems clearly superior|pg||
nt|athene: NS can bid lots of hearts but that will only encourage east to bid a slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok here is the CC for NS now: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJKeng.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be awkward for n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: which is the awkward part?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ntmon: but i agree .. NS on the way to problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart lead against nt is marked lucky east has 10xxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: getting to grand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: At the other table, North switched to a diamond at trick two, but chose the lowest...South, duly misled, led one back|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S will make if the defence foolishly try to cash @HAK, but not if they switch to a club to take out the entry to the diamonds, of course|pg||
nt|glen: thanks Hedy, typical swedish cc, very little blank space left|pg||
nt|dburn: Kokish hasn't yet managed to persuade Rodwell to overcall 1@s instead of doubling|pg||
mb|2S|nt|MolvaM: heart lead and low spade switch?|pg||
nt|granguru:  and west @HJx|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: like well into the soup|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I'm still bidding 3c on the s hand before you have your blood spilled|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh then @sA disappears|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is on in many denominations and level is difficult to judge too|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ntmon: the only problem with 3@C is that should not be enough |pg||
nt|ntmon: at least they're on the same wavelenght|pg||
nt|roswolf: advance sac taken|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX doesnt even start to show this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: it really makes no difference to their qualifications|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, now 4@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree hedy|pg||
nt|3for3: kokish basically believes there is no hand too strong to overcall.  Rodwell doesn't see it that way here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|MolvaM: even if misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|hedyg: anything is fine as long as they avoid 5@ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup i think duboin was taking the time to light the proverbial cigarette|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: much of a muchness|pg||
nt|glen: i thought they played for lavazza and coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the grand is missed i fear|pg||
nt|hedyg: Thomas thinks XX shows 3 @ss only|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 4 card fit and singleton @c he had other bids available|pg||
nt|roswolf: meckwell will probably have a similar challenge in the other room|pg||
pc|cK|nt|blum1956: clear pass for North on 2@s from my point of view, but Pszczola is a world champion which I am not|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could get 6 proverbial IMPs fine for that  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange not to correct to @s|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: seems to gain a few imps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: they did well to stop below game, but even this is probably not going to make|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: seems Madala decided they would take no @H tricks if EW played|pg||
nt|glen: and the cash out stops at 4 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: better cash the K@H now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|ntmon: reaching 4@H X would not be problem on tables, where W passes and E opens with @S preeemt|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that may mean an imp to the israelis|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: they took all their tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: always depressing for a defender when declarer wins your opening lead and swiftly returns the suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|3for3: especially at NT!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|woozle: Fiona did well on lead with a trump...a heart (or club) lead would have cost a trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is like an insult|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|blum1956: as opposite to 2@s which is makeable|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: nothing is much better here|pg||
nt|3for3: I like a low club better than the king|pg||
nt|dburn: happens to me all the time - my partner's card at trick one is suit preference, to tell me what I should have led|pg||

nt|ntmon: the wrong result for Monacco atributed to their EW pair in OR|pg||
nt|athene: better lead a diamond against 6@H here|pg||
nt|granguru:  1Nt or 2@D NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes for once not a lot of scope for action|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcarroll: Lots of work|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lots of work needed|pg||
nt|ntmon: leader changes after each board |pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be too hard though|pg||
nt|roswolf: another distributional fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: another pretty hand but only enough for game|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|woozle: only two certain losers, but I'm not sure how many winners|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the @D lead signposted|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is GF raise with singleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D shows 1 singleton(unspecified) + gf i am told|pg||
nt|athene: some specs might be wondering why east didn't just double|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: there are two possible explanations|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|jcomyn: finding h here will be tricky|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and game on|pg||
nt|athene: firstly they might play x as t/o of hearts (unlikely)|pg||
nt|glen: the modern style: bid five card majors, count points later|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= semi-forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT general gametrial..|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@d has some sort of play - not sure how good a contract it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: secondly he just wants to emphasize he has real playing strength in diamonds so there might be a sac|pg||
nt|glen: the semi-forcing NT allows for opener, once having counted points, to pass to avoid trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: the term semi-forcing will always be a puzzle to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy +90|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus it is NOT forcing?|pg||
nt|hedyg: or just 4@H|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|athene: whereas a lead-directing double could be as little as @DKQ10x or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: trumps 3-2 plus some work, I guess|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ntmon: much depends on methods now|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice no XX from Gino to show Kx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean: it is either forcing or it isnt?|pg||
nt|granguru:  correct|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1NT conventionally asks for point count? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: well your supposed to bid again if you have a decent hand very like drury without the guaranteed trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: , see above |pg||
nt|glen: semi-forcing is a terrible term, but was meant to distinguish between 1NT not-forcing limited to about 10 pts, and the modern style where it can have game invite values|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: not enough entries to make the @d s work and too bad @h distribution to crossruff effectively|pg||
nt|woozle: On the last board, Harding in the other room tried 3NT with the matching 4333s - down one also, but had chances for 10 in|pg||
nt|roswolf: brakes need to be applied now|pg||
nt|roswolf: simple auction|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: it is a terrible term indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but rarely does in my experience|pg||
nt|granguru:  for me semif means "you may pass if you have a sub min hand  or a min with a bal distr"|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: i'd say more than some :)|pg||
nt|3for3: but the black JT's are very useful|pg||
nt|hedyg: iv) For the KO stage, teams not in the first eight rankings in the Swiss A are re-ranked from 9-32 according to seeding based on WBF/EBL masterpoints. The teams ranked 1-8 in the ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Swiss A, in order, each pick a team from the rest of the teams seeded 9 to 32. After these first eight choices the right to select the opponent passes to the highest remaining ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: seeded team and so on until the bracket is completed. For the purposes of composing brackets the number in the bracket is |pg||
nt|hedyg: determined by the order of the selection|pg||
nt|dburn: if North leads a heart, you have to commit yourself at once - if he doesn't, you have some breathing room|pg||
mb|4N|nt|roswolf: OTT|pg||
nt|athene: i guess one other advantage for 4@D over double is it takes some room away from opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 6@d by East may be better than 6@d by West for that reason, but there's not a lot the Swedes can do about that now|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: which red suit to try is the question|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: very lucky for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: A bit sad here that the third diamond will be ruffed with the short defensive trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: if Rodwell does lead a heart, he should choose the eight and not the jack|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: since he probably would not lead the jack from KJ|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, declarer may need to pick a black suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: easier for us, as usual|pg||
nt|3for3: those black suits look very similar..|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|athene: ok, it looks here as though madala has shown a diamond control|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think n/s were reckless here although who was to blame we may never know|pg||

pc|d2|pg||

nt|athene: lev has a tricky decision after the double|pg||

nt|cenglund:  The pre-emption of the opposition makes it hard to find|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|nt|cenglund:  N-S is giving a lot leeway for further exploration of the slam|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H just says "well i want to play in game somewhere, not sure where" so you have to have fitting honours for all suits outside hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but not enough length in any one suit to commit to that suit|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I still doubt that they land in 6D|pg||
nt|athene: now east might be thinking very mildly about 6@D but that is a lot to ask facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like the X from N - justr give extra space to EW|pg||
nt|athene: still, if he could ever get there, this bidding might help him|pg||
nt|cenglund:  6H is a good save|pg||
nt|athene: he knows west won't have three spades, probably, so there is no loser there even if they are missing the queen|pg||
nt|athene: and west won't have a heart honour|pg||
nt|athene: so they are playing with a 30 point deck|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D would be aggressive but not ridiculous|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: oh well, it was not to be :(|pg||

nt|dburn: now, if West can bid 4@h as a sort of "last train" or "Bluhmer"...|pg||
mb|d|nt|glen: natural or 16/17+ many hand types|pg||
mb|r|nt|woozle: Pepsi bids only 2NT...he apparently has lower standards for vulnerable 2H bids than I do|pg||
nt|woozle: Seamon-Molson raises to say "yes, I did overcall vulnerable"|pg||

nt|dburn: ...which apparently he can...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: nice contract|pg||
nt|dburn: ...then East-West have a chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows his hcps, though not heavy , are good|pg||
nt|3for3: not sure what rodwell's double of 4@H was, but it will make it easier, as now east can show heart control.|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@c either nat or any strong hand|pg||

nt|blum1956: If North opens a strong 1NT, what will West bid&|pg||
nt|blum1956: ?|pg||
nt|woozle: North much too strong for a strong notrump...although at favourable I might open 2NT|pg||
nt|woozle: A strong notrump is the second best preempt in bridge, after 2NT|pg||
nt|woozle: Is Pepsi deep in the tank, or is this a coffee break?|pg||
nt|blum1956: This time 1@c is the worst option for North - East may even preempt in @s s wich solves the problem for EW|pg||

nt|dburn: 2@d one major|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D the other?|pg||
mb|4D|an| |nt|athene: 3@D will be a spade raise anyway; presumably 3@C would be hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d showing invite + in @s|pg||

mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: and can add toit here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c would be invite + in @h|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe this is a hand t show invite + in @H and when d bids @H bid @s to show both majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: the noose tightens|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he has no 4 cards in any other suit than @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: some superbergen|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm ok this looks as though bocchi made a forcing pass and now a slam try in spades which is surely a bit optimistic with his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south tempted to bid on!?|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: passssssssssssssss|pg||

nt|roswolf: might give preference|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well 2 imps to the swedes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: cannot be a forcing pass opposite what might be just invite|pg||
nt|glen: i still think ripping up cards will result in lowest possible minus score|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 8 card fit is better than nothing|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh no !|pg||

nt|MolvaM: if duboin had not rdbl'd it would have benn just ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: next time i play in my cuebid i must try to remember this moment|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italian will be x -rated in the post mortem|pg||

pc|c4|nt|roswolf: low trump to start|pg||
nt|granguru:  diagnostic?|pg||

nt|roswolf: gib says -7 dd|pg||

nt|roswolf: take|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is only when Madala doubles that he is better than invite|pg||
nt|3for3: a little chancy for cullin to double.  is meck is 0-2 in the blacks, might be cold, or his side could be making.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: just dont play @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@H was discouraging|pg||
nt|hedyg: in this situation it just denies the ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: seemed easier to disc 10@D|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sT|nt|hedyg: if the 3@D bid had been gf, then it would have been a forcing pass|pg||
nt|athene: it's reasonable enough to play pass forcing if you showed at least game invite values and opps go to 5-level; 99% of the time they are advance saccing|pg||

nt|3for3: as long as rodwell didnt play @D all ok.  He had no reason to against 5@S undoubled.  If Meck had doubled, might have been looking for extra 200 point undertricks.  here the goal ...|pg||
nt|3for3: was a modest +50|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: yes normal contract |pg||
nt|athene: but we just don't know the NS agreements here (or i don't anyway) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: lots of hcp but not much chance of a slam|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: if west just holds up his @SA isn't he beating 5@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is, needs to hold up twice|pg||
nt|athene: he ducks twice - now if bocchi plays another trump he takes the ace and plays a fourth and the club ruff goes|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called , Ginossar think 5s was -1 |pg||
nt|athene: if bocchi ruffs a club himself, then west can simply force the south hand in clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: Tadeusz, did Gino duck the A@S?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe bocchi claimed 11 or something and west agreed without really thinking it through|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely though|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but fatigue does play its part|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that unlikely, only 4-0 @ss could beat him|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might well have played a @s from hand and claimed|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: Well i haven't seen , Bocchi has just claimed|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so we will wait, once declarer claims all play stops and you call the TD if you dont agree|pg||

nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: me 2|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|jcomyn: might try 3nt here a behind bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be from the same family|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may not be so easy to stay low enough - that 1@s might turn out to waste space rather than save it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 1@D for me too|pg||
nt|3for3: it often does|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it seems that West can use relays of some kind, rather than have the auction start 1@s-2@h-3@d|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|MolvaM: living thru this at the table is bad, but worse will come during scoring when you say minus 1400 |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt much superior|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c gf relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: but no difficulty bidding game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT= 8-10 ZZ with a singleton|pg||
nt|3for3: how do you find 6@D opposite Q@S, A@H, a @D honor and A@C?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they wont gey overboard either|pg||
nt|hedyg: ZZ points..|pg||
nt|3for3: or even less with better diamond fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: A=3, K=2 and Q=1|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|woozle: McGann has been there before - the big preempt putting pressure on NS in exchange for losing an occasional miracle slam|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s on the previous bd are playing in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: IN THE OTHER ROOM|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: lots of controls in n hand why not 2nt|pg||
nt|dburn: but an initial 1@d would not have shown diamonds, and if East can show what he has by responding to relays, 1@s may lead to an easier auction all round|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c relay|pg||
mb|4C|an| |mb|p|nt|woozle: Pepsi chooses to go quietly with his 17-count, fearing that a double will be pulled too often|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice judgment here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well it must be makable since NS took 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is dangerous|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it looks dangerous, but they probably have it under control|pg||
nt|3for3: this is one of the things that makes bridge hard to 'sell' to the general public.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: e/w will need a lot of the captain's coffee at the end of this match she wont be very sympathetic|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: "please continue to play, i will give you my decision"|pg||

nt|blum1956: This is a partscore board besides McGann has another opinion))|pg||

nt|hedyg: 4@C showing short?|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about @H?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: i am sure there is no bid to show both singletons|pg||

nt|3for3: 4@C was probably 5161 with a stiff DUECE of hearts :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|granguru:  Duboin should have passed 1@H doubled but I give sementa the greatest part of guilt.for not passing 2@C.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Swedish experts think he showed exact pattern, thus wasted hcps in W hand|pg||
nt|dburn: people don't spend months and years devising these methods just to make life difficult for the commentators|pg||
nt|dburn: they do it because it helps them reach more right contracts than wrong ones|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: h lead from w would n ot be nice|pg||

nt|jcomyn: isnt that amazing|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||

nt|hedyg: thank you too Geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|ritong: he did not pull the third trump, seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: what did he do with the 2@ds in his hand?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ritong: ruffed both|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: we will be back at 14 30 CET, in 1 hour and 38 minutes|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry thx to John as well|pg||
nt|granguru:  fortunatelly IMPs table doesnt punish you very hard after you already gave away a lot of IMPs in one hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcomyn: 20 impps in last 2 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 1hr 35 mins approx|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 40 mins time approx|pg||
mb|d|nt|glen: some styles like a 3rd seat 1@H here|pg||
nt|ritong: i suspect our operator anticipated a little:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah ok, didnt pull 3rd|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: new leader - i didn't tell that during last few boards|pg||
nt|hedyg: not when KJ are behind :p|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcarroll: yet another Major partscore hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hedyg: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: west might try an aggressive 3@S now, thinking his @DKJx mesh nicely with his partner's diamond suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt by east|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in fact, of course, they mesh nicely with *north's* diamond suit|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 2@C then 2@S i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: the pitiful crutch of 4SF |pg||
nt|athene: show an invitational hand but stop at the 2 level|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and not 5 minutes after conceding 1400|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 37 minutes|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think not|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s will press on to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: an easy contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: last board of this match now and of the Swiss teams|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to our outstanding operator in Poznan, Tadeusz ! to my excellent fellow commentators Geoffrey, Danny and David for donating their time and expertise to guide us through ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: these boards.our appreciation to the EBL and the PBF for bringing this event to BBO, especially Slawek Latala  who was intrumental in organizing these broadcasts on behalf of BBO|pg||
pc|hK|nt|woozle: 4S is cold|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s could be made|pg||
nt|woozle: with CA onside, diamond position, spade position and no diamond ruff coming|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@C may not be wise - who has the @S suit? probably partner, and is weak ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big finish for someone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it isnt lavazza|pg||
nt|ntmon: .. but this is not the case|pg||
nt|3for3: meck bought a nice hand from rodwell, who could have had nada.  K@D and stiff heart very useful|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: Yes but has to get @Ds right|pg||
nt|hedyg: can not be more than invite by passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - this match (though entertaining) doesn't matter - but there are some fierce qualification battles going on in both A and B flights|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow morning with the Knockouts|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: frying pan into the toaster|pg||
nt|athene: nope, he tries 3 anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@C and @c switch might help|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that wont happen|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will accept!?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|woozle: McGann tries 4H, down one or two on a spade guess with the club hook failing|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 2@s should be enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: everything is friendly|pg||
nt|granguru:  Italoswiss is a kib with very good memory|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now!|pg||
nt|hedyg: help the defense ofc|pg||
pc|s3|nt|woozle: down one...Fiona surely won't try the SK now|pg||
nt|blum1956: -50 against -140 or -170 is a useful 3 imps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ntmon: X should secure @C lead against 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 card out of 3 is on side|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: craziest contract of the week|pg||
nt|roswolf: north needs to avoid being endplayed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think he can get endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: endplay is unlikely because after ruffing a club and drawing trumps, west has no trumps left so a fourth club is fine|pg||
nt|3for3: i believe the higher you are, you get bonus in KO's, re selection of opponents.  Hedy posted the rule earlier|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10:00 AM CET|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is for teams 1-8, the rest are seeding as per EBL or WBF seeding points|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: even A@H and @H is fine|pg||
pc|s9|nt|woozle: I fear at this point that 3 isn't enough|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|ntmon: prediction? abstain..|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed as it happens but still care needs to be taken|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope no children are watching|pg||
nt|granguru:  some time ago I said whenever one player of each team tries to play the same suit, one of them is out of his mind. I was referring myself to the play of the cards thou|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|woozle: South could try for down two by ducking the first club|pg||
nt|athene: maybe @S6-@S4 is a subtle signal asking for a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: but bocchi can see it doesn't really matter i think|pg||
