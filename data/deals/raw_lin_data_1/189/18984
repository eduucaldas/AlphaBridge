nt|alok_daga: Hi,RV,Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: A routine 4@h hand for EW to start|pg||
nt|rv: straightforward 4@h to begin with to calm the nerves|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/germany/piekarek-smirnov.pdf|pg||
nt|rv: Mahaffey have 3 pairs, each pair can play twice if it is on rotation though I suspect Meckwell will play all 3 segments|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: here we go...|pg||
nt|petergill: EW should avoid 3NT|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rv: what is 2n opening by Mahaffey?|pg||
nt|rv: looks like it is not 20-21|pg||
nt|Walddk2: stoppers in all suits he requires|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|rv: E-W pair in OR have overreached to 5@h, chance for Mahaffey to strike early blow here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: on 1m-1M, many play (3M-1) as strong (18+) @h raise leaving 1m-1M-4M to be distributional raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: this flexibility is available on all combination of 1m-1M except for 1@d-1@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems strange that Michel made a move over 4@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Son is captain and signed off in 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Jim Mahaffey usually plays 2@D Multi, 2@H = 5@H and 5 other, 2@S = 5 @s and 5minor, so perhaps 2NT opening would have shown both minors. |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: NS carding    upside-down count & attitude   spot card leads are 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|rv: Roland, son is captain of the partnership on the deal and not in the match right?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: right|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: I was referring to that particular deal|pg||

nt|galadriel: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s likely a weaker raise with 2@h a good raise|pg||
nt|glen: E has two choices: X, or 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: with @sAx, @dK, @c doubleton, a sensible 2@s even with doubleton i suppose|pg||

nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Michal, Jon, Peter, Bill and Walter|pg||

mb|3D|nt|tsadek: west need fit +K@C then he ask for aces|pg||
nt|pelu: here I prefer "Nt as transfer to @D (and 2@S for @C)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  weak nt and a rubish stayman by n|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: expect 2NT to be @D transfer, and 3@C = likes @Ds|pg||
nt|glen: and now W has to decide is it a good day for not vulnerable games|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: so 3@H = singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: diff when u have 2 singletons :)|pg||
nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
nt|rado: @D lead and @S underlead Ak will beat it but unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  just in time for an exciting board :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, 5@S will make|pg||
nt|jfaria:  who could bid it?|pg||
nt|glen: W may think his 4@Ss means that E has a singleton or void|pg||
mb|3N|nt|galadriel: Do you think North should bid one more? Or is he worried to push them into makingslam?|pg||
nt|thenapster: hi all:)|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but as u said, since NV, he passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/osw2t1-1.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Lotan|pg||
nt|thenapster: we are going to see very agressive style by the Danish pair|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: NL in 7@d in CR|pg||
nt|pelu: standard bidding : 3@D tranfer, 3NT pass/correct, and 4@C = cue with good @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: now it's ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|vugraphpl8: LEV: sory partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: From is point of view, 6 of minor could be on|pg||
nt|glen: hi Krishna, Lotan|pg||
nt|psyck: will be tough to match the aggresion of Meckwell sitting same seats other table :)|pg||
nt|thenapster: :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|galadriel: his|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think the light opening by W succeeded|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: what was that about fines for slow play, how about fines for slow bidding?|pg||
nt|tsadek: I like Verhees bid of 3@S in closed room , Force his pd to bid 4@C with K@C|pg||
nt|pelu: not easy when two players from so dif nations and diff style play together|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  my connection is so slow that i fear commenting one game after the one is played :(|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|rv: in my view, West's hand is worth transfer to @h at 2 level and raise to 3 level as Invite|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|rv: 4 level transfer is bit aggressive though it may not cost since N-S can make partial at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@D transfer to 4@h. |pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: not sure if Cohler's pass something specific|pg||
nt|petergill: East passed 4@D as he did not want to be declarer on a @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS just says   you can declare if positional @D value|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mahaffey could have forced the transfer via RDBL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And redouble is a retransfer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: snap|pg||
nt|petergill: If N now bids 4@S, S will give preference, with the Dbl of 4@d probably showing @D|pg||
nt|rv: Piekarek's double of 4@d may just show @ds for starters, some play such doubles as t/o of @h suit,  but may not be able at high level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gitelman-Moss had a disaster on an auction like this not so long ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When one of them redoubled and the other one thought it was to play|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: At the other table, N was allowed to bid his hand at a lower level, not made to guess like this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would 4@H from Piek show @S + minor?   if so, was that a better route than starting with DBL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D dbl  redouble   it was|pg||
nt|rv: it is important for partnerships to sort it out whether double of 4@d is just @ds or t/o of @h, meaning of subsequent double depends on earlier intrepretation|pg||
nt|petergill: Difficult guess for S now - to bid or pass |pg||
nt|petergill: Jim Mahaffey's direct approach could be on 7 hearts and no HCP - the direct jump makes NS guess |pg||
nt|rv: Smirnov may take push to 5 level with 4n which could show primary @cs with @d tolerance|pg||
nt|petergill: As Jim's teammates Meckwell might say, the aim of the bidding is to give the opponents more guesses than your side |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and prefer giving opp the LAST guess|pg||
nt|petergill: The play of 5@c or 5@D could be very interesting indeed|pg||
nt|rv: my preference is to play double of 4@d as showing @d and subsequent double as t/o of @h|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|rv: at lower levels say (1M)-(3m) showing variety of raises, I prefer to play double as t/o of M|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Only one top loser in 5m, but defence can tap NS by leading @H, making play tricky|pg||
nt|rv: Smirnov has chosen the option suggested showing primary @cs with @d tolerance|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 5m will be allowed to play undoubled and might make, but the play could take longer than the bidding|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: which minor strain plays better double dummy?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: depends which tap the defense starts, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|petergill: Piekarek is ranked 16th best player in the world, his playing record is at http://www.wbfmasterpoints.com/playerdetail.asp?Code=5722|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: normally better to play in strain of weaker hand (5@c here) which may not have entry otherwise|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect 5@c plays better here|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D happens to be easier to play than 5@C - Piekarek probably worked that out in the bidding, that @H's being ruffed by clubs makes 5@c awkward to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right   Piek was always going to declare after 4N|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, Piekarek is  17. His partner Smirnov is ranked 27 in the world - his record is at http://www.wbfmasterpoints.com/playerdetail.asp?Code=8651|pg||
nt|rv: 5@d could play better as suggested by many specs since 5@c could be very difficult to handle on @h lead|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: Lots to think about, including that East's Pass of 4@d might suggest no high @D's|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: though with @DQxx or Qx, East might still Pass 4@DX round to partner|pg||
nt|rv: Cohler's best defense is possibly to duck this and next round of @cs as well|pg||
nt|petergill: Set up the side suit first = usually best strategy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rv: now making |pg||
nt|petergill: East might be thinking that N might be 4054 on the bidding - no, then N would bid 5@C over 4NT, so N must be 5053 or 4063|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: Cohler should have done ducked @cQ, can't hurt|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|petergill: Spade overruff looming ...|pg||
nt|rv: Piekarek might still get it wrong unless he runs @DJ now|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||

nt|galadriel: These high level decisions are so difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: couldnt agree more, Peter|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|glen: we the mention of meckwell we are now down to 2 specs|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rado: again some action with all hands non-balanced|pg||
nt|rado: N may bid @C 1st hoping to introduce @S later by DBL , or direct start with DBL|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: I am told that some play that 3@H = 3+ @hs and 3Nt a mild slam-invite|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: all bbo tables - http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/index.php?r=348267|pg||
mb|3D|nt|thenapster: the danish pair is playing 4h in borad number 1...probably 5 imps for the amercians as a start|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jfaria:  @d keep being a safe rescue for nt oppeners .)|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: Hi all|pg||
nt|galadriel: They will get to 3NT here|pg||
nt|galadriel: which is a tricky contract|pg||
nt|galadriel: plenty of HCP but no real source of tricks|pg||
nt|jfaria:  y, trick power in every suit|pg||
nt|jfaria:  probably will get a favourable lead|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|rado: hi|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: but with 6HCOP East could never invite for slam - so prob a misunderstanding - we will prov know later|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|glen: some partnerships have given up game invites on the N type hands, just blast 4@S and hope the unknown nature of the hand can help|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h had play, but mostly double dummy, so as you say, likely -1|pg||
nt|thenapster: not a good descion to bid 4cl..that will go -3 instead of 3sp down|pg||
nt|glen: it don't like 4@C on the 3-2-2-6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|glen: here the 3@h and then 4@S indicates a stonger idea|pg||
nt|jfaria:  big swing first board|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brotherp: hi all|pg||
nt|brotherp: lets see if Denmark can come back|pg||
pc|d6|nt|glen: but hard for N to find the perfect cards in the S hand for slam|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|glen: good duck at trick 1|pg||
nt|pelu: pl Kibs - can u tell: was 3Nt slaminvite or just Pass/correct?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: what the heck is a zt penalty?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|glen: greco-hampson (in another match) reached 3@S|pg||
nt|galadriel: They got X'd in 5@S in other room for 850|pg||
nt|jfaria:  double game swing outch!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Interestingly, it was South who competed to 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Both pairs play Precision. I think I can find EW's CC, one moment|pg||
nt|bigtrain: sorry|pg||
nt|bigtrain: privaye|pg||
nt|bigtrain: private|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|glen: now what does S do?|pg||
nt|jbgood: no need to say this will not make - but all of a sudden you see defenders going astray - not here though|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|glen: and their opps did likewise|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brotherp: hi joao|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|thenapster: so 5-0 for Maheffey after the first board of the segment|pg||
nt|psyck: The @h's not dgood enuf, so while the 1st endplay worked, 2nd will not help |pg||
nt|psyck: so likely -2 now|pg||
nt|thenapster: yes|pg||
mc|9|nt|alok_daga: the last hand,a pretty hand 2 defeat 5hrts,wud require gud defence|pg||

nt|petergill: N had complete count - perhaps not overruffing in @d might make life harder for N|pg||
nt|rv: Cohler could have ducked 2 round of @cs or taken second round of @cs and given ruff to beat contract|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: E had 5 @S, 3 @C (when @C10 held) and 3 @H ---> @d 2-2, assuming @H 6-3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-18 HCP, 5+@H   [maybe stronger if good 2-suiter]|pg||
nt|rv: really shapely hand, N-S make slam in @cs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rv: as cards are, even 13 tricks available in @c strain|pg||
nt|petergill: If Cohler plays @HQ, not @H6 on 2nd @H, N does not have 100% count of the EW hands|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=@C|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now what?|pg||
nt|petergill: Adverse vulnerability rules out 3@S, and would rule out 2@S for some conservative bidders|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the science of bidding 8410   i'm not sure that chapter has been written yet|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rv: I am not sure if North is forced to bid again on South's 3@c, if not South should have made a stronger bid by crossing 3@c|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@S cue now might encourage N to risk 6@C, but|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: transfer advance is usually played as Inv+ in which case opener cannot just bid responder's suit with extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: S has not yet shown extras, and @DQ (if missing) is likely to be offside on EW's bidding, so perhaps only 5@c|pg||
nt|petergill: especially as S has to cue 4@H in case N has: void, xx, AK, KQJ98xxxx or the like|pg||
nt|rv: in my view South should have bid 4@s instead of 4@h to show strong slam interest|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H cue = 1st or 2nd round @H control, denies 1/2 round @D control|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: or would 4@D set that as trump?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@s cue, 1 or 2 round control |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: You cue in sequence - if S bypassed 4@H, his @H would be queen high, a lie |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think 5@D was a cue of @DQ, but am not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: S had a terrific hand for his bidding, so he was happy to bypass 5@C|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: all is well that ends well, N-S have reached optimum contract single dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is very impressive result|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 4@S was RKCB for clubs and 5@D was 2 with no queen|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

nt|psyck: well, if they just play trump, that may also work|pg||
nt|glen: sadly all bbo tables do not fit nicely into my iphone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: the 4@S bid here will be enough to get to slam now|pg||

nt|glen: Q. what is 2NT, A. unknown to us, but likely forcing game try, that in this case is a slam try|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: how can u ask with void in H?|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: rules aren't nearly that simple RV|pg||
nt|petergill: Another challenging bidding hand for NS - Meckwell passed with flying colours - our table might take a bit longer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=weak 2@H or 2@S opener|pg||
nt|rv: more popular is kickback convention where suit above fit suit is RKC (4@D-->RKC for @c, 4@h-->RKC for @d, 4@s--->RKC for @h)|pg||

nt|petergill: An interview with Alex Smirnov is at http://www.abf.com.au/events/not/2011/bulletins/12Sun30.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy says NS use it as either/or   so Smirnov either long @H or takeout of @H |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rv: some play double of 2@h as showing t/o of @h or very strong to do anything else|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: 3@d by Piekarek could show Inv values if he could have competed via 2n (lebensohl)|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of N-S treatment on this auction, maybe Smirnov could have tried 5@h instead of 4@h|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: if partner's 3@d show values with not much wastage in @s, Smirnov could have risked 5@h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: It looks like 6@H depends on a club guess if no club lead, but you can try to set up diamonds first, and you will succeed|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth's card play technique in 6@h was flawless (of course) - @S lead, @DK at Trick 2, and if need be, he could ruff the spade winner to set up the 5th @D |pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pelu: if max 18 the very optimist 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: declarer will punch out the @S ace|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think they r very closee to bidding this one|pg||
nt|brotherp: 2@S might be clubs; and 2NT might be pre-accept with an honor....but then again not knowing their agreements that's just a wild guess|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@s = @c and now S is describing his shape i'm told|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is natural invite|pg||
nt|pelu: ok that make sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i believe Meckwell play 2nt response to 1nt opener as asking for a 5-card major, but maybe 1nt on this sequence denies a 5-card major|pg||
nt|bigtrain: excuse me///  noticed 4th seat|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 18-19|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no it doesn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: seems impossible for south to bid 6 ..not holding any ace|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jfaria:  a mild slam try by S but that's it|pg||
nt|jfaria:  killing lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: the slam in 24 (6@h) bid by 11 out of 26|pg||

nt|galadriel: So, Tundal will get his ruff and must score a @D trick to st it|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|galadriel: set|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell's NT ranges are 14-16 1/2/3NV & 15-17 3V/4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|galadriel: 8 boards to play, and nothing in it - very exciting!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: or 2 :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thus since this is fourth seat 1@C-1@D//1NT = 18-19|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: declarer only has 8 obvious tricks but east can be thrown in to lead a diamond, i guess|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Reqd passive defence|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H and @S = endplay on E|pg||
nt|pelu: still endplay for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: when the @SK gets ducked you tend to assume east is more likely to have the ace|pg||
nt|fokal: with the fast duck, declarer might think as of @s is onside. |pg||
nt|jbgood: Piekarek - Smirnov still bidding  3 next door|pg||
nt|fokal: yes. But the position is not clear|pg||
nt|fokal: cashing could easily go wrong|pg||
nt|athene: east can see that if he wins the @SA he will probably get thrown in with a spade later|pg||
nt|pelu: Ns in 6@c B3|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 6@c reached in OR|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|athene: so he ducks to try to just deceive declarer|pg||

nt|Walddk2: or was that another 6, venky?|pg||
nt|rv: yes Roland|pg||
nt|petergill: The big difference was that East did not exit in @H, so playing for 3-3 @S was his best chance|pg||
nt|rv: super start for all specs|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: a different multi-purpose 1@C opener this time|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|petergill: To play for spades 4-2 and @H 4 (incl Q) in W and 3 in E - well, he did not do that - you would need the hand records to play like that on the defence he got, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=michaels [@H & @S]|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: 2@D both majors, Michaels|pg||
nt|rv: not my choice of Michaels with Mahffey's hand at these colors|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Sehwag contemplating where the next six will come from, but I think he is going to defend this ball|pg||
nt|petergill: Jim Mahaffey loves to bid, likes to put pressure on the opponents|pg||
nt|rv: definitely prefer 5-5 and better quality of suits (intermediates)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's become more and more common   strangely giving back some status to @C suit   where 2@C overcall of "could be short"  is Natural|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump leads skewer 3@SX|pg||
nt|rv: yes another double, pass and lead a @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Smirnov's pass confirms a weak NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Does Piekarek know that Mahaffey likes to bid, likes to take risks, even when vulnerable? If so, can he dbl and can S pass the dbl?|pg||
nt|rv: could turn out ugly even 1100|pg||
nt|petergill: I think N will simply bid 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Italian Blue Team  made RV's suggestion a mantra    "double and lead trump"|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: NS play in US Nationals a lot as a hired pro pair - but I don't know how much experience they have playing against Mahaffey.|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal to bid 3NT. |pg||
nt|rv: for academic interest, here slow double by Piekarek doesn't impose any ethical issues on Smirnov to pass or bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with 1435 Smirnov could have doubled, so he is a favourite to have a doubleton spade|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: And pass therefore looks attractive|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Gary Cohler doesn't play all that much with Mahaffey (Mike Passell does), so East's 3@s bid was perhaps not with full knowledge of his partner's aggressive style|pg||
nt|rv: yes Germans missed an opportunity here and Jim Mahaffey will continue to bid like this, if they had doubled and he had gone for 1100 may not employ Michaels with 5-4 distribution ...|pg||
nt|rv: again|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: well played|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||

nt|jfaria:  So the Danes bid game on board 18, not a good game but one that makes :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: opportunities yet again|pg||
nt|athene: when you lead the @SK you are pretty much sure to have KQ or so|pg||
nt|athene: so a defender over you with the ace can duck and he knows it probably won't cost|pg||
mb|1N|nt|galadriel: precision style|pg||
nt|jfaria:  precision 2@c|pg||
nt|thenapster: flat 3nt here|pg||
nt|glen: meckwell could very well open this S hand 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but if the defender under you has the ace he might be a bit more worried|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|pelu: so 3 board and 32 IMP :)|pg||
nt|athene: if you had only KQx, say, then it might cost a trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: Thomas was looking for a @s weaker than the 2 but he only had the Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: it seems that NS use 1NT as a game force relay|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fokal: so he had to cash it :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|glen: they will ask 84 questions, then reach 3NT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: an interesting treatment indeed|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|galadriel: 3NT can't make on a @S lead|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s lead.. only count 8 tricks|pg||
nt|galadriel: But after 1NT- 3NT in other room, East led a natural @C|pg||
nt|jfaria:  my mac is rather slow today|pg||
nt|jfaria:  big swing|pg||
nt|thenapster: so south will show 11-14 with 5332 and north will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT is interesting, with 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: doesn't matter here, but we will wait & see if it makes a difference in the coming deals|pg||
nt|glen: specs voting for XX to play here|pg||
nt|psyck: he can simply play @h for 9th trick in 3N on this bidding rather than trying @d|pg||
nt|brotherp: reaching 6@H seems likely now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|galadriel: This auction gave West the chance to overcall @S|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah!|pg||
nt|glen: now E is feeling the heat|pg||
nt|psyck: E wondering what the 2@h x was all about|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: only 3 top-losers in 4@s but not 10 tricks|pg||
nt|glen: E hunting for a number here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  again the slow approach may help E to bid on|pg||
nt|brotherp: 6@H very interesting - after D!A lead u might play for the C!K to be offside - making for a very complicated hand|pg||
nt|brotherp: looks like a possible trump-squeeze ending|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brotherp: w ending with @s J9 , 1 trump and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|brotherp: e ending with 4 spades and bare c!A|pg||
nt|brotherp: and south being squeezed|pg||
nt|brotherp: lets see|pg||
nt|brotherp: btw sorry for the comments with the ! ---still not completely used to the interface|pg||
nt|jfaria:  that would be a line for  a jr on a jamed VG :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: east has a very big hand looking at the bidding|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|galadriel: now it's ok|pg||
nt|glen: he passes in reasonable tempo to keep his pd's options open|pg||
nt|psyck: S opens @h, they gf, pd surely can't be wanting to penalize 2@h...but E is the one with @h void :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|glen: gives up beer card early, never a good idea|pg||
nt|psyck: specs get their wish|pg||
nt|glen: in polish methods, to save beer card, the lead the @D 2|pg||
nt|glen: *they lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|glen: if N can open that hand type in 3rd seat, S should not bid bidding 3@H on a 3-3-3-4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|galadriel: I can understand West - he had a second 5 card major - may have been a surprise for declarer, who obviously had a @S stop|pg||
pc|hK|nt|glen: its hard to see W taking 6@H tricks here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Lev told his story|pg||
nt|brotherp: still lev might go for beauty and play the trump-squeeze way|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|rado: good stop by EW, 5@C needs @D finesse|pg||
nt|alok_daga: prediction.this brd will cost IMPS|pg||
nt|rado: yes N might open 4@S 3rd pos:)|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Y,7 411 MAY TEMPT HIM!|pg||
nt|thenapster: big score here|pg||
nt|brotherp: certainly after @dK lead|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||

nt|fokal: @s now to limit declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brotherp: need a c-switch now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c9|nt|glen: the @D 2 in some partnerships would indicate some values in @Ds, not the switch from 7642|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|galadriel: perhaps it ws|pg||
nt|galadriel: was|pg||
nt|jfaria:  easier 4 us anyway|pg||
nt|fokal: now S can do a safety play in @d (@d the the 8)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|glen: i have no idea why the @D switch was tempting|pg||
pc|c2|nt|galadriel: At least it keeps the match close|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|glen: declarer can arrange a later trump endplay|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: not the best defense - better @h 10 - 3x@h and a lot of @s-tricks for EW|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|s7|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: starts with another multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|petergill: The vital factor in my opinion was how wild are EW as bidders. This is the key issue - NS's prior knowledge of EW's bidding inclinations|pg||

mb|3H!|an|cue-bid|nt|rv: Al, does Baltic @C played by N-S here have some similarity to Polish @c?|pg||

nt|petergill: If Rodwell, with the nice side suit as a source of tricks, cues 4@C (agreeing @S) over 3NT, then slam would be reached|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: it derived from Polish  --  one of biggest differences is Baltic 1@C covers the Polish[Precision] 2@C hand with long @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 6@S is a good contract. If trumps break 4-1, it might still make if @D is not led|pg||

nt|brotherp: smooting lead for declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brotherp: kind of hands and leads u want being ahead|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hugly cards in Lev's hand, but good position of K @S still a hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: maybe our kibs from Netherlands will help?|pg||
nt|psyck: OK, now I understand what Lotan meant when he said we can expect some aggresion by NS|pg||
nt|brotherp: not finessing risky with @d 6-2|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think E is in control|pg||
nt|brotherp: wonder if he can read @d 4-lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: trick slams are the toughest to bid|pg||
nt|fokal: oups|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jfaria:  at this time i guess E already knows about W @h |pg||
nt|galadriel: strong @C auctions are very useful in these hands as they allow lots of room for exploration|pg||
nt|jfaria:  indeed|pg||
nt|athene: maybe if Rodwell had bid 4@C or 4@H over 3NT (good hand for spades) they might get there|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he's not good enough for 4@C but he could make the bid if he had a better hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: everything friendly here, so will make them all|pg||
nt|fokal: does 3 @s shows support ?|pg||
nt|athene: if he would super-accept 3@H with most 4-card support then i think he is really max for spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: or "may" perhaps more correct|pg||
nt|fokal: and 2NT is 20-21 ?|pg||
nt|athene: if you just count points he only nas 19 but really that is not your average 19 count|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 19-20|pg||
nt|fokal: ok|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs suggest 4@c over 3 NT... N's hand very suitbale|pg||
nt|fokal: in that case he is maximum indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: only 4@H in OR so 13 more|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|jfaria:  with no oposition i guess they will reach 6|pg||
nt|galadriel: the @H10 is a big card :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jfaria:  better in @h, any imp may become precious|pg||
pc|cT|nt|galadriel: Indeed|pg||
nt|athene: ona  4-1 spade break you might still survive in slam even on a diamond lead - need @CK onside and the four trumps to have 3 hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: 45 IMP after 4 boards - that only prove, that also top-players make mistakes - and it has been some difficult board|pg||
nt|athene: then you can get both of south's diamonds away in time|pg||
nt|athene: the key to slam being so good is having two long suits to run, and a 4@C cue would not show that, but if he could bid 4@H showing a trick source and a big hand for spades...that ...|pg||
nt|athene: might do the job|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|glen: 3NT in the other room is one of those few 3NT contracts where there are 8 tricks, but almost no hope of 9|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|glen: i can safely say that since walddk95 is not watching this table|pg||

nt|psyck: Watching or not, the F******* word is still banned in the commentators enchiridion.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 11-13 BAL|pg||

mb|2N|nt|pelu: 2@H overcall (alomst) OK - but why did East bid on in CR? - and here??|pg||

nt|pelu: ok 8 toptricks - better played by S (@hJ in dummy) - if u need u can finess in @c|pg||
nt|jbgood: not that it would have mattered much|pg||

nt|fokal: N has to play @cs till he still have the @d stopper|pg||
nt|athene: it might look obvious to us to set up the clubs with a diamond entry|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but he has to play a small @C now|pg||
nt|athene: but rodwell may be worried that declarer has @CJ9xxx|pg||
nt|fokal: and I'd say that for his point of view, it's quite clear|pg||
nt|bigtrain: to keep an entry|pg||
nt|fokal: I'm guessing he is hesitating betwenn K of @c and small @c|pg||

nt|fokal: though I don't know meckwell way of signaling|pg||

nt|fokal: it usually is from 10x actually|pg||
nt|pelu: then better lead @CK (for count)|pg||
nt|fokal: hum|pg||

nt|psyck: well, the 3rd seat opening may have kept them out of slam, not sure if they'd get higher uncontested though|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jfaria:  nothing special on this one, G/T runnig out of hope|pg||
nt|glen: anybody for 6@H?|pg||
nt|psyck: W may have needed to open for EW to bid slam|pg||
nt|glen: some specs vote for 7@H on the layout|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @s would have been easy - 3 a bit more challenging, but ...|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|athene: surely that was ace and another trump|pg||

nt|rv: I very much doubt and not even sure if it is odds on for a grand slam|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: xxx in hearts for example|pg||
nt|petergill: Venky has a point. A 5-2 spade break makes 7@C hard to play.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is more frequent than having four cards|pg||
nt|rv: on a normal @c lead, possibly need @cs 2-2 and @s breaking|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H 4th suit forcing, to make 3@C forcing|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think Kelsey would have called this 'daisy-picking'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Get to the point and jump to 4@C|pg||
nt|petergill: South's Dbl, West not bidding NT and West not Rdbling 2@HX might encourage East to think West does not have many wasted points in @H|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|petergill: East now expects a mild @H holding wasted opposite him|pg||
nt|petergill: If 3@d was a cue, West is running out of bids he can make - other than 5@C which bypases RKCB|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: With that East hand 4@C is better because he does not need much info before he can blackwood|pg||
nt|rv: will West bid 4@s here or sign-off in 5@c?|pg||
nt|petergill: so they will stop in 6@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- Cohler may actually envision better fitting hand than T Bessis expected after dad's 3@H rebid|pg||
nt|rv: Cohler will do well to even bid 6@c|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: bridge is cruel game, E-W have bid better than their counterparts in CR and still lose 11 IMPs:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: As I said before, 7@C is not cold by any means, but it is relatively easy to make on this layout, provided that declarer does not play for @SKQ with South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: trying to ruff them out|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: Roland was right - a direct 4@C over 2@HX, as at the other table, would have worked wonders - not that 7@C is that great a grand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is moot in 6|pg||
nt|fokal: 7 @c is a lot easier to play than 6 @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not, Oliv. There is that @SKQ trap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i read stories about a top player/character from the 30s who would berate his teammates when they bid a Grand  EVEN IF IT MADE|pg||
nt|ahollan1: name that that person  for 10 points|pg||
nt|rv: Al, I am not his descendent:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I notice that the lead in the other room was @CJ, which rates to be a singleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as one would often lead small from Jx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best guesses only going back to the 40s       it was P. Hal Sims|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thomas must just have played for both black suits to break|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: And succeeding!|pg||
nt|galadriel: 10 back|pg||

nt|galadriel: For running scores http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
mb|p|mb|7C|nt|glen: N nicely goes with a safe lead|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, major suit lead would have saved time for us though|pg||
nt|psyck: They stayed out of slam last deal other room too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: so it still remains a relatively low scoring affair with no double digit swings|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3nt in open this may get too close|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: rodwell also opening 1@S to keep it young|pg||
nt|athene: 7@C is a big bid with no trick source|pg||
nt|jbgood: a tall order|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs trumps 2-2 if trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes even a nine-card trump fit isn't enough, if that is all you have|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jbgood: and everything falls into place|pg||
nt|athene: lots of specs are saying he does have some spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but he knows his partner has a spade void|pg||
nt|fokal: he can win by ruffing 3 @s|pg||
nt|athene: so it will take a fair bit of work to get the spades set up|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but needs trump do to the fact he has only 1 entry|pg||
nt|athene: 4-3 spades and 2-2 trumps means everything is happy of course|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not exactly a laydown grand|pg||
nt|fokal: but it seems he need @cs 2-2|pg||
nt|pelu: some strange results on result page: Board 2 (open) 5@D - 1 on BBO scored as +600, Board 6 bridgemate: only 2Nt +1 not 3Nt making (here i this room)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: could play for both @S onside if he doesn't think trump splits|pg||
nt|athene: there are various options in spades like @SHx with north (ruff one then ruffing finesse)|pg||
nt|athene: or just the double ruffing finesse against south, yes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm offerring an alternative line|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yesterday, Zia ventured 'Zia's Rule': "Don't lead a trump against a grand slam", he said|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it diesn't work buthe may choose it since the other option is trump 22 and @S 43|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|athene: :) well the rule "ALWAYS lead a trump against a grand slam" is definitely a bad one|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or KQx in @S|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe zia has gone too far the other way|pg||
nt|pelu: the rule is: dont lead trump if pd has QJ :)|pg||
