mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 1N is not an ideal bid with the E hand facing an unpassed partner, as it is so strong for suit play and has no urrgent desire to be declarer if played at NT. however, the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: alternative of 1D is not the key to the city either as a 2N rebid is less than ideal also|pg||

nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|kirp:  hello |pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42:  welcome back in Poznan|pg||
nt|davpro: Morning all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes   h   missing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult grand to bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems bochi plays in both rooms :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: Ola Joao, Hi all|pg||
nt|kirp:  interesting hand to start off with, NS in @Hs, EW in @Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup: here norht has 5-6 -majors and opened-now ew shoud find 5 @d that is the goal let see|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  A splinter in North would do fine - in later defense|pg||
nt|jfaria:  ola Danilo|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|davpro: Thx operator. It looked like an forcing pass-opening :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|runnerup: this is 200 -not enought but ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: Who is Brogeland playing with?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty operator|pg||
nt|kirp:  they need to take ruff quickly or 4@H makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davpro: Ah- there the name came|pg||
nt|runnerup: @s ruff needed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  You have seen too manu bad overcalls, when you sell out with the North hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: missing the @DQ they have to diagnose they have extra trump length to compensate|pg||
nt|kirp:  dangerous hand as 5@D makes EW|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|jfaria:  routine 4@s 4 those 2|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  south hand is known as Bridge World Death Hand (BWDH)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  invitational values with 3-card support for partner|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a nice hand with spade values and N has an easy raise to game with 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has built a trap - will remove to 5 @H, only losing 100 I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is there a reward for "slowest bid hand of the tournament" - without special reason...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello all|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Zaleski needs some results tocach up the playoffs |pg||
pc|dK|nt|Gerben42:  with Qxxxx x Axxx xxx North would pass and 4@S would be cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt played the other way round - no spade lead|pg||
pc|d9|nt|danilo1: 4@S will make (prob. +1) .. .in ev. 5@D, declarer needs to guess @H (must play 9 from hand) for -2 |pg||
nt|runnerup: very dangerous I wander if 3nt was to play or some minors|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Gerben42:  but there is normally no perfect answer|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 tricks are on ice here|pg||
nt|roswolf: players names will be up in a mo|pg||
nt|jbgood: going through the motions|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 controls and west will ask for the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
pc|c6|nt|runnerup: looks dangerous -all tricks possible|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed 4@s and E might have shown 4@h. I don't know their system :(|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: didnt bother played his pard for 3+ diamonds or the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D may yhave promised 3+diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @S suit was hidden by N|pg||
pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: who can hold Qxx diamonds? thats the question|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|roswolf: only problem is the potential 3-0 trump break|pg||
nt|roswolf: doesnt matter here:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does the lead tell any story|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jbgood: puppet i think - then 3@d shows 1 or 2 4 card majors, and deny 5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  13 tricks - over|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  or 12|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: One of the answers is to use an artificial tool to separate hands with 3 card spades and those with 0-2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 6 is down with @H lead|pg||
nt|davpro: y- that was my guess too|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: then responder bids the suit he doesnt have |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|runnerup: y a big swing for Joker to start|pg||

nt|vugraphpld: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|rcerreto:  I'd rather X|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  but would live with 2@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you could sell me either but my instinct prefers 2S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: possibly in-stink though|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2S leaves one well-placed if pd makes a GT|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X leaves us well placed if pd has hearts|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  the risk is partner could pass when you have game, but it's not that likely|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  4@s isn't too bad but here it'd fail|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: i think neg X would probably lead to same contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rcerreto:  you need a @s finesse and then some to make 4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  not odds-on when not vuln.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 4S is very odds-against|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: they can and should force you to a heart guess early, and it is better than 3-3 clubs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rcerreto:  surely not when white|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

nt|roswolf: 10 or 11 tricks operator?|pg||
nt|davpro: there was actually 12 to take (double dummie)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: solid start for the dutch|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good start|pg||
nt|roswolf: a fortuitous start for angelini|pg||
nt|roswolf: hu bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi bill:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: more spice here|pg||
nt|kirp:  1st board is not a nice way to wake up in the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: 10 point all around. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Peter and Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello|pg||
nt|athene: without the @DA Nunes would likely have led fourth best|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: with 6/5 and only 1 defencive trick normally better to play in attack|pg||
nt|danilo1: strang - when we look in names here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|runnerup: perhaps east should take it away -he has got support in hearts so ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: Angelini seems to be in the A Swiss almost no matter what happens in this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand for n/s to bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: these guys have good nerves,but average players can shake a bit after start like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: y and Mossop will need a good result to joij them|pg||
nt|roswolf: fulvio has seen his pard's bids before|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kirp:  conservative pass by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: *join|pg||
nt|jbgood: 24 vps to Mossop |pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 from each group to A - the others to B|pg||
nt|pelu: hard decision by S - 4@H is down 1 and 5@c also down 1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c looks good|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 5@c making - only defense is @H lead and the @S - kill the entry for the 4. @D|pg||
nt|jfaria:  5! still cheap if opps bid game|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45:  About 12 tricks again - but lucky and only in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jxxx in @D are very much - the double by Versace means balanced hand value in @S - Zaleski can reopen|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: kibs rush in to tell me that if defence plays spades 5c cant make|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s finess off so no game on|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like game 1 down|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: then 27 from A and 5 from B go on to the KO stage|pg||
nt|davpro: They found a 6-1 fit instead of the 6-0 fit. On level higher though|pg||
nt|pelu: has to take 3x@C befor @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: the non-vul Townsend might venture an insurance 4@Hs |pg||
nt|jbgood: but I think a black suit or even NT play better than @ds|pg||
nt|davpro: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: some sort of short suit trial bid?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|MolvaM: we see all 4 hands but sometimes at the table it is not obvious to shift to spades|pg||
nt|danilo1: 5@C is on ... and good to avoid 4@H, that is tempting in 4-3 fit (single @S on 3-card side)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 2@C forcing one round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best lead: @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - NORTH is declarer... - wake up|pg||
nt|pelu: yes defense has to kill @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south wont get in much to lead trumps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would also make on the @S-lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead small @S possible but @H equivalent - many use to overcall 1@S in West to give the lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with weak 5332 i agree to pass like Versace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But an overcall would put the contract in South, so...|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing really helps,but contracts should have been by south this time -by n= -if spade lead,but now 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the option between @H and @S lead is a typical problem in bridge|pg||
nt|kirp:  surprise pass by both!|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Now defence need to get active |pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4s has good chances|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: with trump Kx inside and clubs 3-3 and the @dK safe|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|roswolf: and wont necessarily lead one anyway:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - wrong table:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe 2 |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eamongall: still time |pg||
nt|bagman: N has to duck the @HK if W plays a low heart|pg||
nt|bagman: Both N and S know that there are no spade tricks to make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even in the case of a spade shift, stuurman has to be very careful to keep all his diamonds and let his spade honor go|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: i prefere to lead in the suit more solid, but without a solid suit i prefere the lead from small cards - but is is only a opinion|pg||
nt|jbgood: NT is more flexible than 3@d|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bagman: They also see the clubs so they can make extra tricks only from trumps|pg||
pc|dT|nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kirp:  ty, thought N would bit it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: a stronger defence was diamond lead, heart back, then another diamond|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok inspite off 9 points north desided to pass 3 -right this time -perhaps 3 small trumps and too balanced nd not vulnerable  make that|pg||
nt|kirp:  stopped in 3@S in OR, |pg||
nt|runnerup: no he raised --ok|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|jbgood: an imaginative E might bid 3@c then:)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kirp:  N's QJ of @Cs were too good to stop in 3|pg||
nt|runnerup: so -5|pg||
nt|kirp:  in OR, W overcalled, hence any finesse rated to lose|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|eamongall: At another table McGann Brown have reached the happy position of having 3 vulnerable doubled undertricks available against 4@S ...they still have to collect them |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi john|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi john|pg||
nt|danilo1: good play .. 2 Dummy entries for (if needed) repeated @H finess|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Gerben42:  going plus got to be worth something|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so far +100 is almost worth everything|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if Madala is N then S is Rimstedt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  operator please correct S name?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think finesse in @C give more % at declarer|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dutch duly gained 11 imps by bidding the grand|pg||
nt|kirp:  so chalk this pickup due to sound overcalls|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: E has ugly hand to lead from|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|rcerreto:  he chose to lead from longest and strongest|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club is only safe lead, but both N and S could easily have clubs|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  1@h from N notwithstanding|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  it could have worked but not this time|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|h4|pg||

nt|MolvaM: here is the link to running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: interesting 3NT call by north in the other room|pg||
nt|runnerup: look 1nt / ns|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|bagman: EW are currently 4th fighting for a medal|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  the polish Club|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks like a peaceful 3 NT by N|pg||
nt|jbgood: or S for that matter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tokay-baldursson at the open room is a very new partnership which might explain why they couldnt find the grand|pg||
nt|athene: certainly a bit of a gamble but it paid off very nicely this time|pg||
nt|runnerup: east is not tesyed because north stoles hearts|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|danilo1: looks like routine 4@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|runnerup: normal 4 @h = with no other ideas -from anyone -looks like it ,but..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: Rimsted clearly gambling with her heart suit|pg||
nt|davpro: yes. 9 easy tricks, but not the best communications...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 nt - 2 @h - 2 NT - 3 NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  some would call it practical :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all colors taked by weak players :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North bid both, @D and @H|pg||
nt|jfaria:  another routine game|pg||
nt|kirp:  a @H lead is not good for defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  N has 3 trix in the suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|MolvaM: misfit hand but contract seems makable|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible here perhaps|pg||
nt|jfaria:  at least for us looking at 4 hands|pg||
nt|kirp:  this will challenge N in the play|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|athene: 6@S would not be great here even with the @D9|pg||
nt|kirp:  @Ds are sitting wrong or maybe right given lack of entries to N|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|athene: the point being, on a club lead, you have to draw trumps and then cash four hearts to discard a club from the north hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: they might go down here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: the first non-alert after 3 rounds of bidding :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: N should know that the @c king counts for full - and bid 3 imo|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|davpro: They stopped low, but if @ds are not 3-3 a higher contract would be a struggle|pg||
nt|kirp:  now N has a problem|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|danilo1: @CQ lead may create some playing options ... cashing 2 @H immediatelly may be loosing option|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: although the bidding thus far is cloaked in mystery they seem to be powering into it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42:  with a bit more fortune it would have been a claimer|pg||
nt|bagman: In pairs it might not be that practical as the bonus for the game is not that big as in teams|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duck this @D could be a idea|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gives the same result, if South plays safe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but give at south the chance to fault|pg||
nt|danilo1: well done|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: 4@S MIGHT BE FINIS|pg||
nt|roswolf: and it is not sure what happened there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at the other table, tokay asked for keycards and then asked for the trump queen apparently. why??|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  Absolutely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on the previous board|pg||
nt|athene: actually i guess it would be ok (provided the hearts come in)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: the @D-lead gave S a fine tempo|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kirp:  that looks like 6 trix for declarer|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west was somewhat stuck for a good lead|pg||
nt|pelu: 110 = 9 IMP for Monaco|pg||
nt|runnerup: trying to help parner well done -now surely down|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h4|pc|d8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|jbgood: the point is that you create swings when you dont bid games on 26 combined |pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|davpro: To be fair against N. 2N from S was perhaps a bit low (aswell)|pg||

nt|davpro: So, with less and 3-4-1-5 distibution he would always pass?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zmud has 5-5 reds again|pg||
nt|MolvaM: anyway...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: another lively hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: another freakish deal|pg||
nt|athene: west isn't quite worth 2@H i think in their style|pg||
nt|kirp:  that was down 1, wasnt it|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@h is max|pg||
nt|jfaria:  slam zone|pg||
nt|kirp:  VG, need to fix score on 23|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes -i think so too --this 3nt must be played by east or 5 loosers can come up|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|bridge_one: same defence in other room |pg||
nt|athene: their 2-level openers are 10-13 and only really, really huge 9-counts qualify|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed not now here come the fireworks|pg||
nt|athene: in third seat, of course, things are relaxed a bit... :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Is E's dble penalties?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north will lebensohl his way to 3@H i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: can west rdbl for blood here?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bridge_one: 2@H is limited at 9 hcp 3 cards raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3rd slam hand in a row?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  better in @d|pg||
nt|danilo1: if ev. 6@S ... @C lead or @H and @C switch may be vital|pg||
nt|danilo1: *is vital for defense|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... rite contract (unbeatable) is not 6@S ... but 6@D ... guess difficult to come there |pg||
nt|runnerup: so double for takeout -problems in bidding by west perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: you have to guess well to make 4 @h -but that is bedt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A poor 4 @H - but you might be forced to "guess" right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East is evaluating what bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: this @d lead asked may help to get rid off spade looser|pg||
nt|jbgood: choice between dbl and 1 NT...|pg||
nt|jbgood: pass never an option for Boye on a near opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: lebensohl is heading n/s into danger here|pg||
nt|athene: well, whether he can or not, he didn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will leap high|pg||
nt|MolvaM: leader board and running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: but is it high enough|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you redouble in these auctions you help opps because they now have more room to scramble for the best fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: but defense may start with 3 spades and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where south needs discipline|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW play a strong @C, so this shows points|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: not any more|pg||
nt|davpro: 8 quick tricks for defense here on a spade lead. 7 for declarer on that lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 7 th in the bag|pg||
nt|athene: also you warn them with borderline hands to stay low|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S WHATEVER IT MEANS SEEM OVER THE TOP - WEST SHAPENS HIS AXE|pg||
nt|athene: so here for example if west had redoubled, south might well have decided his partner didn't have what was needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: sharpens|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@c must be @d |pg||
pc|s8|nt|MolvaM: lets see if they can locate the missing @d control|pg||
nt|roswolf: they should do|pg||
nt|roswolf: the flexible double|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch is comming|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bagman: Declarer needs to ruff the heart losers and discard a club on a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  UNDO|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade honors not so attractive for madala|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well be passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has nothing to cue and has soft club values|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kirp:  I think pass followed ny pass or 3N would have been better bid by E|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: they dont have a lot of hcp to spare|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR NS in 6@H - looks like S gave a false cue bid in @D - but it was an artifical bidding over 6 round|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow thats enterprising|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the italians are merciful|pg||
pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: in another table north could go with J2N and that might be a problem|pg||
nt|danilo1: exactelly ... if Alfredo decides to try more than 4@S ... he will not bid Diamonds :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I believe 4@C was just cue|pg||
nt|jfaria:  456 kibs tell me 4@c is just a cue |pg||
nt|jfaria:  being a cue, no way to reach @d :(|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Not likely as we only have 285 here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: i am told they are in slam in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he still likes his hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  just a figure of speach :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: NS have done very well to enter bidding ... if South pass, EW would have time to find @D |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well even if diamonds are not led. no way to get rid of the 2 losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: and that is enough for norberto:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does 4s have any specific meaning?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just an old fashioned cue?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|runnerup: no fight now just posible over tricks |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i want to bid on and i have a spade control|pg||
nt|roswolf: the latter|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems an easy-ish make|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bagman: The @DA must be with E: if W has it, then E has the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But how can you play bridge - NOT leading partners suit with Ace-x???|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You MUST have seen too many bad overcalls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: try both finesses and hope that the @d10 takes care of itself|pg||
nt|roswolf: the pass of 4@S said dont lead one i am told:) so he follows his own suggestion:)|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Glen Ashton|pg||
nt|glen: hi|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hard to tell probably Lauria would treat is hand as single suited..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: very controles bidding here|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe enough here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's concern on a diamond shift is whether to finesse the @C9|pg||
nt|roswolf: now off|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think he will|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  Happy Christmas now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: push hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks srange but no spade losers went away |pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps has been a better idea to pass and wait for partners d --but ofcause partner can pass too -but if y double partner never bids nt -because you have all spades|pg||

nt|bagman: NS can make a minor suit slam|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe EW have some Namyats type of device over 1m openings|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3N-2 was only worth 20%|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  last round not finished yet?|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can show real clubs, S hand becomes very valuable with the source of tricks, heart control and trump support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if it starts 1@C 4@H, what does S bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4NT perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: but E has a hand where she can prevent NS from changing that information. After 1@C, E can bid 4@H and then?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. tough if 1@C can be short (3 or even 2 cards)|pg||
nt|bagman: if 4NT shows primary diamonds and secondary clubs then it's the bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the problem with such a bid is - what will pd think it is|pg||
nt|bagman: I wouldn't be surprised if there are some other agreements for the meaning of 4NT|pg||
nt|bagman: or no agreements :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is an area where regular partnerships are ahead of the game|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@HX is 500; it's better than the vulnerable game for EW so they might take the sac|pg||
nt|runnerup: 11 in both tables and we though how to make 10|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me slam makable if no @d lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well if you can duck a diamond and then squeeze somebody afterwards :) maybe|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not sure if this play was superior|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: for running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: south could make 6 of a red suit here if only he could get to dummy twice (lead the @H7 picks the suit up)|pg||
nt|roswolf: there will be some fun and games here|pg||
nt|athene: sorry - of course he can do it|pg||
nt|athene: lead to @SA, and lead the small heart|pg||
nt|athene: then later get to dummy with a heart and lead a diamond to the queen|pg||
nt|athene: easy!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm perhaps not at the table -in the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: only needs east to have @HHx and @DKx|pg||
nt|roswolf: game not reached at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: hampson-greco playing precision so 1@D is nebulous|pg||
nt|athene: south can be very aggressive if he knows his partner actually has some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but not when it might just be two small|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed these kind of hands are horrible for strong club systems|pg||
nt|roswolf: or less bill|pg||
nt|athene: well it's at least a doubleton for them i think; they use 2@D for the short diamond hands|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: Nunes call director|pg||
nt|roswolf: short of bds!?or something wrong with the last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: becouse 2nt invit or forsing |pg||
nt|athene: hmmm - they are not happy about something from the previous board, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: ah - you mean nunes was told that 2NT was showing a good hand and that is why he didn't double?|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is anothe swing possibility|pg||
nt|danilo1: meant 6@D (@S)|pg||
nt|kirp:  score is really 25-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  something to be said for 5@H overcall too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in 4@H in other match one made one down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  5 @D N/S should end the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: wont make much difference anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns has a good score open room ew has some 2h to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: if trumps were 3-1 he would have to fall back on the @d hook|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bagman: against a strong 1@C 5@H would be fine|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt also,but ew can bid more|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S here is the likely spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart partial would be sensible|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 5@D can be beated with @S lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: no just loose that|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: small from table |pg||
nt|jbgood: some lucky day you make 6 @s on this lot - but not today|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt now? :) - he does have seven stoppers in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: the diamond suit now consigned to the dustbin|pg||
nt|athene: i bet a lot of partnerships don't know what a jump in 4th suit means|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. 3@D here - is that natural forcing, natural non-forcing, or what?|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is wrong with a natural 1@D RESPONSE?|pg||
nt|glen: peaceful 4@h here|pg||
nt|danilo1: NS need to stop on time (5@H still on time) ... ev. 4@S or 5@D by EW will be too expensive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3@d ends any slam mess in N/S intentions|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kirp:  should make this for push|pg||
nt|runnerup: true ew can not tough clubs so looser gous so @s later|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: south is sensible|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west also :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would have been interesting to watch 3@dX|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever bids a strong 7-card minor if they have a major of any description|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: after pass at 5@C @S lead became possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lightner...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S ruff, K @C - declarer lose the ruff, one @C and A@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup he had the colors to help him|pg||
nt|athene: i think officially in SAYC a jump in 4th suit is defined as natural and invitational|pg||
nt|glen: ok, a quiet 5@H|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok wrong hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No right hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many pair use pass at 5@C like OK to lead @C, instead DBL means to lead in another suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i don't know the gadget played by E/W|pg||
nt|jbgood: investigating for a club contract (slam?) and got no reaction of a positive kind |pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup: so it was all academical|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bagman: Malinowski has very little defense and can hope that they go down only 3|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of those dark corners that no-one knows about|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1-5-7-0 will not be an obvious shape to the defenders|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: @SK to the ace, diamond finesse i guess|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess will not miss the jead after bidding :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now np|pg||
nt|MolvaM: trump lead effective stop a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni might stick the @DK in|pg||
nt|roswolf: but north made a normal if aggressive raise to the vul game|pg||
nt|danilo1: *lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: kibs - if u know EW-bidding then help us :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bagman: Good time to take the save; in pairs taking an 800 save against a making slam is not a way to win; normally you should take your chances and try to beat the slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: @d cue was what S did NOT want to get|pg||
pc|h2|nt|davpro: But from Ns view; doesn't it seem as if S hasn't got a @h cue?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|athene: now declarer is worried the @DQ might get ruffed, so he would like to lead a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: but entries are a bit on the short side|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jbgood: N looks to take no notice...|pg||
nt|jbgood: S bid well - N somewhat undiciplined - slam is more like a Roland one (which in the old days would be called a Norwegian slam)|pg||
nt|kirp:  q@C next?|pg||
nt|kirp:  knows S has another @S, so needs to take out entry|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|davpro: This could take a while, but will end with 1 down...|pg||
nt|jbgood: If N has the @c Q in stead of the @d Q his hand would be better though|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: (unless the slam is such that everybody bids and makes it)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: when you have a hand like south's, your worst nightmare is getting forced, losing trump control|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

nt|szalay:  N-S are a rare pair from Hungary: they r not from Budapest|pg||

nt|kirp:  strangely enuff, its cold|pg||
nt|kirp:  now with the lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  play 3 trumps, then finesse in @Cs for @D pitch|pg||
nt|kirp:  good bid by E!!!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eamongall: If anybody is following a pair you can find their probable table from the following |pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye may lead a club now and get a plus score ag 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it was the @C position which influenced him more|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much to the play the club ace is right or it isnt:)|pg||
nt|athene: if west invites, east might bid it on the strength of the good club suit, even though he is minimum in terms of hcp|pg||
nt|szalay:  not really, they r from Szeged and few pairs from Pecs|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bagman: S wants to compete but the majors are behind her so she gives up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@C help ,,, opps |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|szalay:  Hungary is more or less Budapest orientated, bridge is even centralized|pg||
nt|athene: difficult lead problem for south|pg||
nt|glen: should be three aces and a trump|pg||
nt|runnerup: in other table declarer took advantise off that same lead to put @d looser away ,but lost control because 4-1 and K -offside in @h contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: OK|pg||
nt|roswolf: the clubs can of course be set up here for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H - 4@D - 4@S - 5@D and 51S by Helgemo!|pg||
nt|pelu: 15 INP to Monaco |pg||
nt|MolvaM: no so easy if east ducks|pg||
nt|athene: north could have made life easier, perhaps, by doubling 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: but he finds the heart anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: some play a double of these transfer responses as some sort of takeout double anyway|pg||
nt|athene: for example after nebulous 1@C - 1@H [spades], X = diamonds and hearts, and 1@S = clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|athene: but without special agreements of that sort i would have thought double would just be hearts and 1@S would be takeout, the same as after a transfer over 1nt|pg||
nt|szalay:  Mr. Zsak is teacher of Szeged bridge, he was teacher of Mr. Cseho of other table when he attended Faculty of Medicine there. as u know: he is my psychiatrist:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  unless E thinks playing for a simple @H finesse is better option!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|jbgood: even 6@h a good save over 4@s:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: spade ace and a club takes it 1 down|pg||
nt|davpro: Defense better take their tricks at once...|pg||
nt|danilo1: 140 I believe|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jbgood: north really bid his hand to the limit:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27 teams from group-A will qualify for the knockouts. and 5 teams from group-B|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might try ducking in dummy and dropping the @H10 to induce north to lay down the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: but that would only work if south would lead the @H9 from @H9xx|pg||
nt|szalay:  as u know: we, Hungarians try to avoid D lead vs NT|pg||
nt|athene: D = doubleton or diamond?|pg||
nt|szalay:  diamond|pg||
pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: 15 how? 5s cant be made I think|pg||
nt|jfaria:  peacefull partscore|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eamongall: We are covering tables 8-15 as shown  on the results web page ... so the bottom 8 lines are tables H G F E A B C D in that order |pg||
nt|jbgood: @s 6 for a club now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jbgood: Boye should be able to read that|pg||
nt|roswolf: and probably on this layout so can 6@D|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't untangle his black suits here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|szalay:  Diamonds for girls, u know|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eamongall: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
pc|d2|nt|davpro: E could hold 764 from W view|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|runnerup: some creek gift so to say|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|eamongall: this is table 13 of 15 in play tables and 3rd line from bottom of scoresheet |pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: but difficult to think that prd has 5 spades (and a @c void...)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: if he unblocks the @SAK he can't get to his clubs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: sorry 5@S down 1 - so only 7 IMP|pg||
nt|szalay:  time for hoping up|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can all see @DK, heart gets the job done|pg||
nt|athene: but not so easy for south|pg||
nt|szalay:  I dont see any layout when small is the correct card|pg||
nt|athene: his partner might have singleton @DQ for example|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed not|pg||
nt|szalay:  he knows pd's cards|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bagman: Now E can ruff the diamond and try the heart to the K|pg||
nt|eamongall: Most pairs move to the table of the pair below them next ... ie 12 goes where 11 used to be |pg||
pc|d7|nt|jbgood: no - then the 7 for his known strenth|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|roswolf: well THE RESULT IN THE OTHER ROOM SPEAKS FOT ITSELF|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: amazingly 5s was made. cant see how|pg||

mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: 5@H 2 down|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: hmm mysterious|pg||
nt|pelu: @H AK |pg||
nt|MolvaM: ahh defence played @hAK|pg||
nt|szalay:  funny, that I read interviews about Fantunes-Angelini affair this morning|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now a choice between to major games|pg||
nt|glen: but W is not selling out cheaply here|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|jfaria:  sure not|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@H a transfer|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@D is unbalanced hand, so I guess N does not want to go 4 penalties|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|roswolf: not a good result for hungary in the other room|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok this if any must be 3nt all around ,but I have learned not to say it aloud,because something not so normal seems to happen somewhere in all boards |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@S correct bid !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well that was a bit of a careless defence I thk|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the spade overcall|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well the alternative is also not attractive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@d says nothing about @h i presume, just shows fit/short|pg||
nt|glen: N's pass would be forcing for most, after the 4@D shortness bid|pg||
nt|glen: now S has to decide if his hand is gold, or straw|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jbgood: 5@s made on the unfortunate lead of the @c ace next door|pg||
nt|jbgood: doubled to boot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: transfer to spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H|pg||
nt|szalay:  I doubt anyone could miss a game here|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@S denies 4 @Ss|pg||
mb|2H|nt|runnerup: north has not found hearts obfiously -so svedish increasing lead perhaps|pg||
nt|jfaria:  depending on agreement|pg||
nt|danilo1: Gold may see @C shortness ... and bid 5@S ... however, not easy choice ...|pg||
nt|kirp:  my explanations are all hypothetical here, have no idea what Poles are actually playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: E doesn't want to lead from her collection|pg||
nt|bagman: Every card might be right or wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: but lavazza may suffer in the end|pg||
nt|szalay:  and I wd like to be in 4S, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: most bid more than 1@S with four-card support but i am sure they will unravel it all|pg||
nt|roswolf: OH I COULD VERY EASILY:) |pg||
nt|szalay:  this game about vulnerable bonuses, more or less|pg||
nt|roswolf: might not be good play but.....|pg||
nt|danilo1: correct action - hand looks like double fits|pg||
nt|kirp:  I guess 2@Cs EW can be held to 4 trix|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: well a simple 4@S on this one|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but congrats geoffrey for yr prediction powers|pg||
nt|jfaria:  that is a nice discussion about ownership of the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay:  bridge wd be a very boring game if we could bid seen by both hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: u sensed that defence coming and predicted 5s making  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is cheeky|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wasnt a very scientific sequence|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but effective apparently|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like he will establish the 5th heart|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes methinks he is very lucky|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: easy game here - time to go for coffee :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but go fast :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: here is the running scores and current ranking http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||
nt|roswolf: you need to qualify for SWISS A then:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|szalay:  I predict 3 imps for Angelini|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|danilo1: Bd 14 - peacefull 4@S in OR too ... so no swing|pg||
nt|glen: versace not cooperating|pg||
nt|glen: he will only win third @S play|pg||
pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: goes for the crossruff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  Trump-lead, North then ducked the @D...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: i oncerad a statistic -if after a normal opening bid you bid game whenever you are vul you gain on average 8+ imps unless your opps double 66% of the time!: i doubted those stats ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: at the time but i am getting more convinced the more i play/watch the game|pg||
nt|roswolf: once read|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|MolvaM: ohh|pg||
nt|szalay:  if u watch (and especially play) more, u know more:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  declarer may only take 9 trix here.|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems to have +1 in any case anyway |pg||
nt|kirp:  he does but does not know @Ds dont run|pg||
nt|kirp:  may not take @C finesse as not necessary!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|danilo1: danger is too loose trump control ... or to loose @C trick ... probably -1 as will try 3 @H in West|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: lost his way|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not the best line- if you overcall on that garbage you need to play it well|pg||
nt|kirp:  ok making 4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: on a club lead north could rise ace and play another :) now declarer might finesse as his only chance to make|pg||
nt|athene: thinking north might have @CAQx and be trying to scare him out of a winning play|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bagman: Declarer was sure about 7 tricks and had a shot for 9 (diamonds 3-3); he did not want to try anything in hearts because he might have lost 4 spade tricks|pg||
nt|athene: that would be the two down|pg||
nt|szalay:  re|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|athene: welcome back :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bagman: 1NT or 2@D were both possible, I think|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  I guess they play 1NT semi-positive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  they didn't stop|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda5.html|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bagman: sure 1NT is semi-positive but an optimistic vulnerable S has such|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  defense needs to be on its toe|pg||
nt|bagman: I have been in worse games and even made some of them|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs luck in diamonds and hearts 4-2 or 3-3|pg||
nt|bagman: and the @CA right|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  luck in @d he has, not in @c though|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamonds as they are, W needs to attack clubs in time|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|bagman: otherwise S can make 4 hearts 2 spades and 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @d luck is over|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he was playing for both aces onside and @h not 5-1|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer planned to steal a diamond and then get one extra in the endgame with his spades and @CK after 4 more rounds of hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|c3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bagman: If the hearts were 4-2, the end position would be x - xxx Kx vs. A98 - JTx xx. A diamond is played and (hopefully) W is in; when W returs a top spade, S wins and plays back a spade ...|pg||
nt|bagman: and waits for a black trick|pg||
nt|bagman: A good plan but hearts are 5-1 and the @CA is offside|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|c4|nt|bagman: I'm not sure for what kind of a miracle S is playing now or has he given up|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes another hidden advantage of bidding vul games:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|MolvaM: yes. but could be more difficult to stay in the top 27 there|pg||

nt|runnerup: loosing 3nt or 4h no game onsome chanche in |pg||
mb|5C|nt|szalay:  may be I am alone, but dont feel any positive to overcall with hand, especially with passed pd|pg||
nt|runnerup: getting ew sacrifise for nothing|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not sure I understand this action by E|pg||
mb|d|nt|eamongall: a decent score for NS for 1NT up 2 on board 7 |pg||
nt|bagman: The spade lead was unlucky for NS|pg||
nt|athene: south might try 3@D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: well there is a generous lead from McGann he won;t be happy |pg||
nt|hawe45:  A fast - flat - board|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i bet 10 tricks here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would overcall for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: after 3@D i think north has an automatic 3nt|pg||
nt|runnerup: very speculiar bidding -really like this..|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|szalay:  I think 1N is a tipical underbid by underdogs vs, world classes|pg||
nt|szalay:  at least 2N is sufficient|pg||
nt|athene: well, the problem is you know you don't want to play in 2nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has seen his pard's overcalls before|pg||
pc|hT|nt|danilo1: misfit hand ... so 3NT |pg||
nt|jfaria:  3nt, what eles?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: you want to play in 1nt or 3nt or a diamond partscore|pg||
nt|jfaria:  on the other hand 5@h had a chance|pg||
nt|danilo1: good conclusion by West that declarer has probably only 4-card @S (otherwise could bid 3@D) ... |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|barbyh: could have heldthem to 1 less|pg||
nt|bagman: There is a theory, which states that against blind 3NT one should lead from the worse 4-carder from a 4432|pg||
nt|barbyh: against matchpoints or imps?|pg||
nt|bagman: both|pg||
nt|bagman: I don't subscribe to that theory but I was told that it was backed up by a huge simulation|pg||
nt|eamongall: The good news for McGann on the last board is some 3NT+2 company is appearing ...|pg||
nt|bagman: who knows; at least it makes leading easy|pg||
nt|barbyh: true, |pg||
nt|barbyh: well in this case lead from a club and you holdthemto 4|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond lead (suggested by the theory) holds the contract to 4, too|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after tomorrow evening the knockouts will start with 32 teams|pg||
nt|runnerup: can he escapepe for 1 down?|pg||
nt|kirp:  even on a good day i see 2 down|pg||
nt|kirp:  and given his bidding, i would gues 3 or more down|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|glen: this @S lead reduces communication to S hand to nothing|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jfaria:  played by N :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: some chance to increase spades |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|danilo1: ... unfortunately for him ...9 and 7 behind 1086|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Forrester may not see 9 tricks, but L/V have more dificulties in finding 5..|pg||
nt|danilo1: since @DK good, and @C10 coming will probably make ... sooner or later, opps must give him a trick|pg||
nt|kirp:  s thinks he can N a @S ruff, but makes no sense given the 5@C bid !|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|szalay:  2D is an option as well, but u have stopper and kinda D suit, when u dont need length help|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|davpro: the @d losers vanished|pg||
nt|jbgood: not easy to find the @d lead|pg||
nt|davpro: nope|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: south just has a harder problem over 1@S than if east passed|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I mean Gold thx|pg||
nt|kirp:  a @h now and its 3 or more down|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|nt|glen: will W exit with a @C?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|glen: (no)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: another poor contract but more reasonable to bid|pg||
nt|athene: that's one reason for overcalling|pg||
nt|szalay:  if he has sthg extras, lets play 3N. 2D and 3D isnt bad, but very likely he will decline without AofD|pg||
pc|dA|nt|danilo1: exiting with @C would not help ... since declarer may play @HA and @HQ .. therefore Alfredo (hoping in @HK at pd) tried to search 2 @S tricks |pg||
pc|d4|nt|danilo1: not taking 10 looks like error |pg||

nt|hawe45:  West must play this 3 NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: more distributional hands|pg||
nt|athene: well 2@D-3@D does show a decent hand so if he has some extra hcp he will bid it anyway|pg||
nt|szalay:  suddent death is coming|pg||
mb|1H|nt|runnerup: 3nt in wrong hand so chance for Zaleski|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South led a small @C, but East had to go wrong|pg||
nt|kirp:  lots of potential here, but actually a part score|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we just love deals with a void rite? :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm 3nt is unlucky to fail here|pg||
nt|szalay:  but it rather looks hungarian death:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1@D 3@D easy ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt opening not everyones choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: modern bidding: three value showing bids to you, and you have 10 high card points|pg||
nt|runnerup: north didnt want open 4 @h because he was too good,but he has his 7 tricks and that is it |pg||
nt|kirp:  N has too many @Ds, knows S also has them or a bad hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 2nt is?|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  how many @h will L/V play?|pg||
nt|glen: established partnerships often use transfers over the negative double|pg||
nt|runnerup: they had 800 ta take other table but wanted to 200 away|pg||
nt|kirp:  Note that 3N by E is cold|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|runnerup: winnig some ipms strange way|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To miss this 5 @D - played by West - will bring Zaleski  8 IMP|pg||

nt|roswolf: this looks boring with no heart barrage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade fit and?|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@H could cost 500|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@h could just escape for down 3 I guess|pg||
nt|kirp:  and by W goes down 3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|bagman: W has so much extras that he can afford to bid the game in NT instead of looking for the spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 teams go to the A Swiss - and the others to B|pg||
pc|d4|nt|davpro: 9 tricks in NT here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|szalay:  what wd u say as west? i feel it normal 1n|pg||
pc|s9|nt|szalay:  good lead:)|pg||
nt|athene: this match does illustrate the "game every hand" philosophy - most deals at least one pair is in game, and when one side bid game and the other didn't, the aggressive action ...|pg||
nt|athene: usually gained|pg||
nt|roswolf: @CQ followed by a diamond switch is possible|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bridge_one: 4@D great choice by Versace|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S seemed to be too optimistic with no fit for pard's suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: ot @CJ:)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  $1h is a real chalenge :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: 31 imps so far for people in game when other room played partscore|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw support X instead of 2C is queationable with so nice C suit|pg||
nt|athene: many play support double is obligatory|pg||
nt|roswolf: I CERTAINLY DO|pg||
nt|athene: even with xxx and AKQJ10xx :)|pg||
nt|szalay:  we opened cause we have so nice C suit|pg||
nt|szalay:  I said only: questionable, may be I wd XX myself|pg||
nt|athene: nunes knows if he wins this he doesn't have much chance|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@h I mean|pg||
nt|danilo1: why 2NT alerted ... it just shows what he has :) ... 3-card @C support, some Hcp, BAL hand - and @S stop|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps even he didnt expect mojor Q eens to table |pg||
nt|roswolf: really|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt not makeable i think so -entryes dead|pg||
nt|kirp:  score is 36-22 for NS, this a good pickup for EW and match is not over|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: but ducking could lead to even more down of course|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: really!?|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw its the correct line if @Cs are 5-3|pg||
nt|athene: he has 8 tricks so he wants north to cash out his clubs - hoping he just loses four tricks and then has a spade-diamond squeeze|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: i guess they play 2@c as game force - but not sure. if so, E may have regretted his pass, 3 nt always on|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4s showed fit+limit hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks -1|pg||
nt|glen: if you just alert only natural, you cut down on the number of alerts|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Lauria must decide between @d and @s |pg||
nt|glen: @d ace now, and with nothing better to do, then the @C J?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Versace I mean |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|szalay:  and try for D-S squeeze|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: maybe -2|pg||
nt|roswolf: obviously west thought 1@C was short ish|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: Even with the bad club break, declarer has 11 tricks losing only the two aces and scoring well in the pairs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kirp:  sorry 36-23|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bagman: sry, the spades break also badly.... |pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: perhaps E just took a shot with his meager values|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bagman: so declarer has only the same 10 tricks as those who play in spades|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|!s|mb|d|nt|rcerreto:  double?|pg||
nt|bagman: with hearts nicely and both pointed suits breaking 10 tricks come quite easily|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|bagman: oops|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  there could be another game available|pg||
nt|bagman: this is probably the highest scoring game |pg||
nt|bagman: I don't know if XX is related to hearts or spades|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  good point|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  could show a max with 3@s|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  but then S wouldn't think|pg||
nt|bagman: but.... If it showed spades, would S still be thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: next round about 16:15|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: I see, that S has problem...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|bagman: S had a very marginal hand for the pass|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he won't figure out the @h layout, I bet|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h2|nt|bagman: doubleton heart and singleton probably makes pass the winning action in the long run|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|bagman: E did not try to give a diamond ruff; S has some hopes that he can run some diamonds thru W|pg||
nt|bagman: He probably cannot guess that the hearts are 4-2 only|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are a favorite to be 4-2 as W did not open 1H in third chair NV|pg||
nt|bagman: Could be QTxxx and E having AQ of clubs and the @HA singleton...|pg||
nt|bagman: who knows?|pg||
nt|bagman: the X is marginal whatever the layout|pg||
nt|bagman: Good news for Greco is that he's likely to make this whatever he guesses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unlikely W would double with QTxxx and only one entry|pg||
nt|bagman: I have no idea what he would do with that; after all he X'd with AQxx and a side A|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i agree, the double is a risky flyer no matter what, and a strange bid for a pair having a good set|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he cashes the @DT |pg||
nt|bagman: then he starts to think how many spades he should cash |pg||
nt|bagman: He wants to shorten the trumps and cash some side suit tricks to score a trumps; or he has guessed the heart position and plays back a heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer still has control of all the suits and has linited hand entries, so cant he afford a second trump here?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he must guess jack or smaller|pg||
nt|bagman: S can afford a 2nd trump only if they are 4-2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why not if they are 5-1?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|s3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bagman: Then he might go down...|pg||
mc|9|nt|marlowepi: wd by NS, to make EW pay for their surprising indiscretion|pg||
nt|bagman: 840 on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|bagman: this was the last hand of this set; thx all and bye|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it's very deflating to the pair and to the team when you were about to have a nice win and give most of it back on the last hand on this sort of undisciplined call|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you dont even know that you want a heart lead |pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: now 28 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: EW can make here 10 tricks in NT on a club lead 11 tricks otherwise|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 more matches will be played tomorrow and then 27 teams from group A, and 5 teams from group B will proceed to the knockouts|pg||
nt|athene: Fantunes are sort of forced to play weak notrump as a consequence of the rest of their system|pg||
pc|hA|nt|szalay:  if u know your pd is so weak for weak NT u wd pass|pg||
nt|szalay:  some players have this "magic talent", others not|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they reach 4@S now north will have all the info he needs to axe|pg||

pc|h4|nt|davpro: What have I missed in the bidding?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tomorrow we start at 10.00 hrs CET|pg||
nt|roswolf: these 2 teams will surely be in contention|pg||
pc|h8|nt|szalay:  this partnership has this "talent"|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has heard the warning bell|pg||
nt|athene: east simply discounted his @CQ on the bidding, so he is left with a nine-count|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that was fine judgment|pg||
nt|szalay:  as I watched many times: they r frequently agressive when pd has good hand, and passive when has bad one...we call it: "magican"|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: only 8 trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bagman: E bid 3NT to show the spade stopper in case W was interested in that; If W had a huge @H raise, he would not pass 3NT|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed a M?|pg||
nt|davpro: 2@d balanced hand , 3@c a major, 4@d ask major  (according to a kib)|pg||
nt|jbgood: probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little optimistic but a fair shot|pg||
nt|glen: 3@S asks are you italian, 4@S=yes|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|glen: this allows non-italians to play the partscore|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: @S-lead would have given the 9. trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: normal lead actually but sometimes people dont like to lead from 5 small minors and choose a major|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|nt|jbgood: the curse of underleading aces|pg||
nt|davpro: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still down|pg||
nt|glen: unfriendly @Ds here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|pelu: but the good old rule 4. best in yout longest suit :) - and here East has indicatet 4 card @s|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|MolvaM: specs tell me board 17 was doubled in other room|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to run the diamonds hoping for too many heart discards|pg||
pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: if thats the case 5 imps more could go to monaco-Z |pg||
nt|roswolf: restart in 15-20mins|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|MolvaM: well we shall see|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the juniors have been brushed aside|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes so close match 36-39 probably -alot off interesting boards tx all bye|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|danilo1: obvious @S |pg||
pc|c3|nt|davpro: Does S know who has got the @d 4?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade switch was needed|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start in 22mins approx from now|pg||
nt|pelu: no X when I see the bidding in OR (direct on the tabler)|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the ace and diamond up looks plausible|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: for results http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: the idea is you just want to make sure of two heart tricks and if the finesses loses you might not even get two|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw first 27 from swiss A, first 5 from swiss B go to KO|pg||
nt|athene: but losing finesse doesn't matter here anyway with the nice breaks in the red suits|pg||
nt|szalay:  and first 8 has the right to choose opps from 9-32|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bagman: There's no legitimate squeeze but it costs nothing to try|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now the defensive spade trick vanishes|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes which was why it was a fair shot|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|davpro: I need some sleep. Thx all kibs for pointing out my stupidity|pg||
nt|dburn: I doubt he cares all that much about the four, given what happened to the ace|pg||
nt|szalay:  the ranking order 9-32 is decided by NOT the result, but WBF/EBL masterpoints|pg||
nt|jfaria:  kind of 2 out of 3 ok, not a bad game vuln|pg||
