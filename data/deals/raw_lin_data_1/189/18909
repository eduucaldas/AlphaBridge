nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: We're off with a fun hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|oosmanb: This 3@C might imply fit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|oosmanb: maybe not fit, as Bryant wouldve bid 4@S not dbl|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Mile|pg||
nt|mcsd: doubleing Pepsi in 4@H is not a good idea|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Mike*|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Dbling Pepsi in ANYTHING is not a good idea|pg||
nt|jr7: No names - but now are we playing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  4@h seems resonable|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oosmanb: Get those @D ruffs going fast!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yes unless we NS get those ruffs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and even then would probably lose imps to vul 4@S |pg||
nt|mcsd: a@d would be a great lead, or switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  playing in nt will meet an unfavorable @h break |pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|jcomyn: nor aqny comment needed either. these mundane 3nt should be abolished|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|jfaria:  2@c must be some kinf|pg||
nt|jfaria:  kind of good hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oh dear|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if you think about it - why bother when 30 tablesd will play in 3nt|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jfaria:  now lets se the lead...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Play in @H all that matters now|pg||
nt|mamos: NS are pair based in England Rob Helle Dutch  lives and works a lot of the time now in Poland  -- a great funloving guy with wit and charm  |pg||
nt|jr7: first he play @C|pg||
pc|c8|nt|oosmanb: Oh wow I was wrong. 4@H +1 in other room!!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jfaria:  yestarday a leaing british master was telling that unsoported leading honours are underrated|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|jfaria:  he defended a honour lead from this holdong|pg||
nt|jfaria:  based on computer simulation|pg||
nt|jfaria:  looks like he was right this time|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Moment of truth|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Will go up I think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but Dbl ..|pg||
nt|mcsd: may be tat dbl is good idea after all :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I really dont know what the right play is, so I'll back whatever Pepsi decides|pg||
nt|mcsd: now lets anylise, S is known to hold 5+@S 2+@C probably more|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Seems like North has 7@C 3@S but 1@D 2@H or 2@D 1@H?|pg||
nt|mcsd: hard to imagine that he would double without a@D , dso that goes for 10-11 known cards|pg||
nt|oosmanb: technically could be 6@C 3@S 2-2 3-1 1-3 as well?|pg||
nt|mcsd: so etleast 2@H going up with K is more then 80%|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|oosmanb: in the other room Rodwell never introduced @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well I suppose an imp is an imp|pg||
mb|1S|nt|oosmanb: so Meck didnt bid past 3@S, didnt dbl 4@H, and they didnt set 4@H either|pg||

pc|d3|nt|oosmanb: The deal numbers are loaded wrong I think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 11-20 that's why|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone like this contract - i dont|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oosmanb: Decent contract, should be able to handle bad trump break|pg||
nt|vugraphpl1: I must give 2 pass. W is dealer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Sorry folks|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of relays|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm getting a lot of help from kibs, appreciate it. 2@H relay|pg||

pc|dK|nt|jfaria:  we lost the more interesting chalenge in 4@s..|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm being helped by Ant Edwards, perhaps 2@S is high shortage, and 3@D 2-3-5-3 exactly|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: they have im sure|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: terence reese once said 4 to the 9 is NOT a suit - and i agree|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: i know that the first relay asks shape  I only know this syastem from being at the other side of the table :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|fann4: It seems that North's sequence may have shown extra values here.|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 2@h looks fine, S placed the contract|pg||
nt|april7: 2@H is ofcourse a better bid|pg||
nt|galadriel: and Popova/Batov are NS|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fann4: At least 9 tricks coming up|pg||
nt|galadriel: For anyone unfamiliar with BBO vugraph, if you click on MOVIE at bootom of screen, you can see all results from this match, click closed room for other table|pg||
nt|april7: after E will continue @C, S has to rely on @D to behave@S will cash ace of @C and pray!@so K of @C, AQ of @D,A of @C and over to the @D suit|pg||
nt|april7: S*|pg||
nt|rcerreto: you actually lack transportation but, in the end, E will be forced to lead either @s toward the K or @c to the A|pg||
nt|galadriel: Popova really needing a good win to have any chance of qualifying for swiss A|pg||
nt|rcerreto: you can cash @cA when in hand with AQ of @d hoping in @ds 3-3|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer is planning to play low probably, but will be expecting a @C return, and then has to decide.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Lavazza sitting very comfortably on top of the group|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||

nt|oosb: double dummy 3NT is best|pg||
nt|jfaria:  almost sure|pg||
nt|mamos: I hate 3nT on this  those two Queensmight be significant |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mcsd: 1nt-3nt (stayman possivble), bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: could bid 3@S as forcing heart raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: s propb ably asking him self why did i assk 2@C in the first place|pg||
nt|mamos: and 3NT right-sided now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Meck did well to lead @C honour by the way|pg||
nt|mamos: Why 3NT ?  you have the values for 1@d|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jfaria:  10 tricks in Nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: and north continues 3nt to show 4333, south passes|pg||
nt|mcsd: that is why he should bidd 3nt imidiately|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  same in @s it seems|pg||
nt|mcsd: defenders now have some informatio|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: what is wrong with this auction|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcsd: 4333?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what 2d is|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the info is not likely to help them|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcsd: o boith sides|pg||
nt|mcsd: late Reese, was against it so om from that school. |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|oosb: yeah 2 @S tricks and 1@C for defence|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jr7: next play :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: all very clever - as usual|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|oosmanb: overtricks now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats why such a good idea to pre-empth only when u have nothing outside|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jr7: 2@D is "reverse" in DK - color + ekstra HP|pg||

nt|galadriel: Yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|galadriel: How many @Hs by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: everything wrong here for EW and will go down  most probably in 4@H|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rcerreto: not too many|pg||
nt|galadriel: I expect they will bid game|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fann4: Many players make a move on the W hand these days.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|galadriel: but it will be unsuccessful|pg||
nt|april7: and should!!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fann4: 4@H, as it happens, has no play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto: after a likely @c lead, 4 tricks are there for the defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|april7: why not 5??|pg||
nt|rcerreto: maybe|pg||
nt|april7: @S back!!|pg||
nt|galadriel: So, no joy for Popova, they must try again in Swiss B to fight for one of the top 5 places there|pg||
nt|april7: but might try small @D, then only 4 tricks for the defence|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rcerreto: well played|pg||
nt|galadriel: Lavazza march into swiss A |pg||
nt|galadriel: probably winning the group, and therefore getting a 3vp carryover|pg||

nt|fabsayc: defense with knowledge of 4333 should continue club when diamond ducked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but they did not :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ALOT of tables opened 3NT as East|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wouldn't matter would it?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in fact he should have returned spade trick 2, then declarer has no chance|pg||
nt|mamos: Oosman makes an interesting point    -- but against gambling 3NT defence needs to win tricks quickly   or contract will make  almost certainly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not to mention right-siding it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: 9+9 = game??|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Infact 17 tables had Q@C led against 3NT from East (so far)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jfaria:  must be @h|pg||
nt|mcsd: so the 4@H goes down 2, nowhere to discard anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  now a cue from W asking 4 a @h stopper|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and 13 led 4th highest @C !|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well that i will never lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Which also means that 30 tables opened 3NT as EAST!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mcsd: e-w may get too high on this hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: sorry -1, i counted @H for 2 loosers|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcomyn: more like a poker classic|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcsd: there is a possibility of makinh 6@D|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: wonder what happens if he does not have h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: easdt|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: On a low club, anyone make?  Could declarer reason: "they always lead aces against gambling 3NT, so he doesn't have @CA, so I play low from dummy"?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: most interesting though, is that 3-4 declarers played 10@c on small @C lead!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: that's some read.!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jfaria:  strange, was expecting last round to be reversed|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jfaria:  meaning 3@s from W and 3nt by E|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|jfaria:  but maybe 3@s would accept @h ...|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|bigtrain: 10 is clear imo....  generally speaking an ace is lead if held vs gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah, answers my question - but it has a lot of logic in a top-class field|pg||
