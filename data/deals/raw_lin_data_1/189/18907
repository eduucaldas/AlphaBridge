nt|stc: Flat 3NT because of friendly @ds|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 15 imps is huge in 10 board matches|pg||
nt|hedyg: you can practically say the match is over except for a miracle|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: while the opps twiddle their thumbs?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|stc: even 4@h would make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: mini NT is at least credible and Syayman looks OK so on track now|pg||
nt|runnerup: destany was 4 down some misfif and 10+10  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT from North will confirm all is well|pg||
mb|3D|an| |mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 3NT from South if 3D suggested diamonds + 4 spades|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: well, its a difficult life being a positivist :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well north did bid 3@C over 2@H led to 5@CX=|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 3nt +1 is my guess|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some communication problems- expect a club lead|pg||
nt|stc: good defense may keep dec in 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|stc: just because the communication problems dec has no choice but @ds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we can see 3-3 diamonds - declarer cant and will be a little nervous about cashing club ace|pg||
nt|stc: no need to cash the A@c, play all @d then AK@h and @H|pg||
nt|runnerup: i think also that 3 @d doent promice spades,just diamonds and forcing,because yu cant force otherways with only 5 cards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok as cards lie - everthing is ok- but if hearts 4-2 then danger of losing 2 hearts and 3 spades- |pg||
nt|odysseus69: however I agree that he shouldnt cash club ace|pg||
nt|stc: there is no danger to loose 2@h and 3@h because defenders has no communications|pg||
nt|runnerup: 26 was not enought to bid game in other table -so leaders will win this board -bacauce 9 at least here|pg||
nt|stc: 2@h and 3@s I mean|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right -no danger when diamonds 3-3 |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|stc: and with @d 4-2 he needs 3@h tricks and K@s on side|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|roswolf: team bessis have 9 more boards to score more is more likely:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he played a bit too quickly|pg||
nt|stc: wrong, only K@s on side|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|MolvaM: diamonds are usually 4-3 but today they are 5-2|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes but he must have though E has A@D not A@S!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: since S did not try a @d finesse nor to ruff out K@D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but whouldnt declarer have started the diamonds right away?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so why did he play small to the J?|pg||

nt|hedyg: it was only obvious to us who saw all cards i think|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right hedy :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@c trial?|pg||

nt|roswolf: needs a 2 suited overcall|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt and 5@d are ok|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chilloncan: very aggressive reopening double there, at all green and facing a PH. risk-reward ratio not obviously in favor of action|pg||
nt|roswolf: a firm 3@D followed by a firmer 3nt!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: even if for t/o dont like dbl|pg||

mb|3S|nt|roswolf: n/s will miss 3nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe olech should have bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: Piek wont let them play anyhow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so difficult for south to bid it from his side|pg||
nt|granguru:  Bubbo de Boer, westra, Leufkens, Peter jansen, Westerdorf, Muller, Jaap trounborst were the boys|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: may try 3@S -YUK!?|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Smirnov will..........pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL PROBABLY BUT EAST MAY THEN TRY A T/O DBL!?:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: imo when opps want to play in your 6 card suit you should let them :p|pg||
nt|roswolf: south knows he is being mugged but ...........|pg||
nt|hedyg: that independant caps key again Geoff?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both N/S players created problems and now its a guess if they can reach a makable game|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it has a life of its own:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or the devil made you do it? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south hopefully will bid soon|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a fraction better than spade finesse|pg||
nt|stc: slam needs K@s + @s 2-2 or some sort of friendly @c, about 40% I guess|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: hands must be bid on the same day that they were dealt :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@D is not a bad spot looking at the n/s cards alone|pg||
nt|hedyg: depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont play lower level lightners, only vs slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room 3NTreached with simple elegance|pg||
mb|4D|an| |mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: disaster looms|pg||
nt|hedyg: the timid double by E in OR did not help the defense|pg||
