mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|bridge_one: the base is 5 majors @d4th|pg||
nt|royhughes: That's great -- I'll let you handle their bids|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|royhughes: South's hand type is always a problem -- do you trap or show your values?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C can't be balanced 18/19 - this is a advantage overall when opps overcall|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1N is natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: 3@C good suit - not strong hand, otherwise DBL |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: this is the advantage to play 2@C or 2@D balanced 18/19|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: south wanted to bid @h noe ew in 2!-looks like 3nt must be bidden now|pg||
nt|rodal f: What elso now?|pg||
nt|danilo1: with @CK good played ... surprise @S lead may beat .. but guess @H lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi for u to Markku:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: if @S lead .. declarer must leav twice .. than switch to @H |pg||
nt|runnerup: so this can be beaten,but probably makes|pg||
nt|danilo1: Sementa knows South has trap pass over 1@H ... so may well chosse @S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  Results for the first match in the round-robin can be seen at http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||

nt|peachy: 10 boards per match|pg||

nt|bernix: good morning and welcome everybody to round 3 of semifinal A of the European Open|pg||
pc|d6|nt|granguru:  finally we got to a std 3NT|pg||
nt|pelu: all card well placed = 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ntmon: hi|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|danilo1: really 8?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: also 3Nt in OR|pg||
nt|danilo1: really?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|granguru:  funnily if  opens the hand (1N) there is a good chance to arrive at 6@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  could be worth a couple of imps if it is played by West in the other room|pg||
nt|chmitty: I must say that I never met the pair sitting EW ... not been introduced to Mister West nor Mister East|pg||
nt|ntmon: improved|pg||
nt|dburn: well, South decided to play for 4-4 spades, so the defence won't be tested any more|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sK|nt|psyck: Hi John & Vladimir|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d7|nt|runnerup: no test at all -so 5 @d only game if all awake but this was too easy beaten|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: This will slide a couple off, but small gain for EW anyway, undoubled|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bernix: so first blood to monaco|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|nt|dburn: if he had ducked a couple of spades, though, that might have been a test|pg||

mc|8|nt|granguru:  but that's fiction bridge :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: defense would never be tested ... Giorgio sees @DA in his hand ... so he knows no prosperity i third @S ... besides, with @HJK third trick, he sees 5 def. tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes, Jeff must know anything about E/W system :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Then with Giorgio for the Italian ones, I won't have to do anything|pg||
nt|fann4: yes, basically 2/1 with a semi forcing 1NT, 15-17|pg||
nt|fann4: You can sit back and relax Roy:)|pg||

nt|granguru:  another potential slam here|pg||
nt|granguru:  a better one thou|pg||
nt|pelu: only need to play @s-siut with no loser|pg||
nt|granguru:  still it  needs @s 2-2 or stiff honor in E and a good guess|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi all|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, it would not have been a very difficult test, it's true|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The Aussie bidded best here by NS as well as W pressed at 2@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ntmon: straghtforward game on  21 |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|pelu: Hi all - as every time there are problems before the first match - players has to find the right table and so on|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3NT or 5@c both cold here|pg||
nt|chmitty: not an easy bid for North|pg||
nt|chmitty: Can our operator disclose the names of the players sitting EW ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: oh yes :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: ty|pg||
nt|peachy: He might go for the practical 3NT if this were MPs, not so sure IMPs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5c for ns if they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: not with odds - but better that a "Roland-slam"|pg||
nt|bernix: part score battle again. can NS buy it in 3@h ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all, gutten morgen Bernard|pg||
nt|bernix: hi danilo|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  Pleased to see that South has a name, but I think I'll stick with 'South'|pg||
nt|granguru:  exchange black QÂ´s and it would have been a rock iron contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: we begin with a possible slam|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: Rodwell did open the N hand with 1NT???|pg||
nt|chmitty: Difficult for South to imagine he has so many defensive tricks !|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will North x now ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hope for him there was not too much of an hesitation behind the screen|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S might have doubled. Vul versus notvul, N had great expectations of making, the colors tell he was not preempting|pg||
nt|chmitty: I agree 100% Raija|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi John|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 clubs best here 6nt /e also|pg||
mb|4C|nt|granguru:  I would have done it if @CK|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think many in the field will bid this one|pg||
nt|chmitty: he must protect the score of his pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|granguru:  NICE TO see u again Raija |pg||
nt|granguru:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Convention cards are not available so unfprtunately we cannot explain bidding|pg||
nt|granguru:  at NT or any Moysean|pg||
nt|chmitty: Next door bidding started 2@s (E) 4@s ... NOrth thinking|pg||
nt|danilo1: nice 6@C ... if by mistake in 6@S - or even 6NT (E) ... all will make|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|pelu: and I would open 1@D 100% (=4+@d)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North has distribution and they have a lot of controls|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@C cue X @Cs|pg||
nt|granguru:  N could have xx to show second round ctrl|pg||
nt|pelu: when N open 1Nt then Meckstroth has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|pelu: RD = 1. round control|pg||
nt|granguru:  but then it is more complicate to show @d ctrls|pg||
nt|granguru:  RD is second if 4@C was first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmmm and a 6-3 c fit not too imp;ressive|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c instead of 2nd x would have worked better|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pelu: @H-lead - 2x@s and @C finess|pg||
nt|psyck: same bidding in other room though|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok that makes life easyer for dsecl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: although 4-2 foirtunate lie in h|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's standard in Poland overcalls are limited, so strong 1-suited hand should X first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course but no 2nd x for me|pg||
nt|ntmon: but after preemptive raise, problems arise|pg||
nt|psyck: if 1345, i'd have Xed 2nd time too, thought 4@c was clearer this hand|pg||
mb|5C|an| |nt|granguru:  If I would be forced to guess  1@C strong 1@S=4 ctrls 2N nat 19-21 3@D @C ctrl no @D ctrl|pg||
nt|bernix: phantom sac|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 4 obvious tricks for defence|pg||
mb|6C|nt|paulg:  It is much easier for us, but can South have less than this to make a slam try with no heart control?|pg||
nt|danilo1: ideal def. is - first @H for A, than @DK and third @D ... guess not easy for Adam now ... since North cann well be single @D |pg||
nt|bernix: but it doesn't matter if he cashes a 2nd @d before switching to hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: i'm inclined to 4@C too but no strong opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: lots of work in 6NT, not impossible I think, but rather aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  a passive lead is a must here|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm thinking E will lead club, that would be my choice|pg||
nt|granguru:  it seems 3@d was nat as N went on to 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: but I am not in Hurd's class of player so we'll see|pg||
nt|granguru:  most passive is @D|pg||
nt|granguru:  the @D10 is a critical card (not here thou) so W has 4 critical suits|pg||
nt|psyck: sry folks, have to switch to another room, c ya|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 6NT by East would not be a mistake - that contract is 100%, while the defenders might meanly ruff something against 6@c|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6NT is surely best .. by mistake I meant 6@S :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 2.best contract reached|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ntmon: see u later :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: slan|pg||
pc|dK|nt|granguru:  N S expects that @S dont behave...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: do u know players where cuebid are 1. control - to day 1. or 2.? back in the 50'es in US they only cuebid Aces - and lost to Italy every time :)|pg||
nt|peachy: that would have been my last choice of leads, Jxx nearly never right|pg||
nt|granguru:  I am wrong E leads|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|granguru:  E has a clear @d lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: Versace will not escape 800 |pg||
nt|danilo1: difficult (almost impossible for Giorgio to correct to 6NT ... he does not see 7-cards @C in West ... and after @D cue (probably single) - cannot risk|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|fann4: I agree with East's pass here - vul opposite a passed partner.|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: 2@c was an interesting call -- I would have expect3ed 1@h|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||

nt|Walddk3: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer can ruff twice in dummy.|pg||

pc|cT|nt|bridge_one: and @C|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would play the same, but i amn't sure it is the best line|pg||
nt|fann4: I think it is|pg||
nt|royhughes: It looks like he plans a sort of crossruff|pg||
nt|royhughes: He is short one entry to simply establish the long heart|pg||
nt|fann4: Lose 2@D, cash @SAK and crossruff|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now @C by North|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, that sounds good|pg||
nt|royhughes: I mean Jeff's line|pg||
nt|heads: -|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||

nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it is a good idea that the very first control is A (or KQ)|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|granguru:  not vul sorry only 22!|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, by the end of tha match, maybe I learn some French by osmosis :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and me some English|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the usual 4-1 break|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - you'd need a relay method to reach 6NT by East with certainty|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at least the sa is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: 2@d both majors ?|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4 IMP for Krajewski - 5@D on  1 doubled|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chmitty: seems so|pg||
nt|peachy: Long time ago, we used to call those bids Polish two suiters, nowadays there are several variations and names for them|pg||
nt|peachy: Hungarian kib tells it is 5@h-4@s, or 4414 or 4405, 11-15HCP|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru:  would like to hear your arguments...I am open minded :)|pg||
nt|bernix: this looks like a run-of-the-mill 4@s to me|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chmitty: So Lauria will probably reject the option of double ... which could be effective in front of a @s lenght|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru:  kibz might enjoy an expert view on the matter|pg||
nt|paulg:  I don't think cue bidding first and second round controls equally makes a huge difference to bidding slams, a lot of it still comes down to judgement|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think the italians beat the americans so often because they had practised partnerships and better bidding methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  being an  expensive deparment players try to reduce judgement and increase accuracy|pg||
nt|granguru:  good advice...on all contracts under 6NT|pg||
nt|peachy: There are no convention cards available for us (or anyone) so appreciate kib help in interpreting bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought they play transfers over 1c|pg||
nt|dburn: may not be so easy to stop these in a partscore, after all|pg||
nt|danilo1: if to play 4@S ... West should declare|pg||
nt|dburn: but they managed it - this is a partscore|pg||
nt|runnerup: true you cant guess in teams -solid 6 @c ok -here only 3 spades  makes  |pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe Duboin didn't actually pass|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bernix: 3@c sounds like maximum with 5-card suit doesnt it|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk NS play 1NT 15-17 (or at least did before) ... 1@C is choice I believe (agree, 6 controls, no soft values, hand better for suit contracts)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@S by West may make ... no chance if by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  agree paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand has another debatable point .. how do you break transfers?|pg||
nt|pelu: too difficult to start a cue bid if only A, a cue is an invitation for slam and often u will miss that - and bidding economy also tell u to start with the lovers cue bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: Since there were so many small boards in the first half, I was hoping that all the spectacular stuff had been saved for the second half. False hopes...|pg||
nt|granguru:  from 6NT on the strategy changes|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1NT will be played on most tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 toptricks for defense, but not easy to take them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i dislike showing a weak doubleton and telling them what to lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  at top level players almost always lead the right card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  so it is better to bid accurately|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
nt|dburn: Sementa might only raise to three, but he's more likely to bid four|pg||
nt|dburn: and he did, before I could finish typing that he would|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brolucius: East has found a strong lead.|pg||
nt|dburn: still, with this lead...|pg||
nt|danilo1: Well, now we have 4@S by West :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: now 7 tricks for Tokay|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3@C dont show about @Cs but only maxz and 3 card support|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i approve of breaking the transfer with only 3-card support, when you are so suitable|pg||
nt|granguru:  once hamman erred a gran slam lead...20 years the hand was appearing in the news|pg||
nt|peachy: running scores Round 3 (this round) http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda3.html|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru:  And he used Judgement..with 2 aces he led the shortest one..(wrong)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ntmon: i think they play crystallic clear Polish club, book version (2005 edition)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be as JASSEMS polish is transfer inh his book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well. Helped a bit, but agree u|pg||
nt|runnerup: so vulnerable try -no trial just bid it -if not made -perhaps even anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: ...Duboin still can't make it, I don't think, but if North puts up the ace...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chmitty: Great decision by Lauria : 5@c would be at least 2 off when 4@h is down|pg||
nt|peachy: I did find a fairly recent card for EW http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|cK|nt|MolvaM: running a long suit usually creates problems for the defence|pg||
nt|peachy: NS basic system is Strong Club|pg||

nt|dburn: he can't put the seven on this, because South might have @c98 doubleton, but he may still be OK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Now a club ruff will beat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with best defence. a @c switch now|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @h9 ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  looks to ask for @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Failing that, a trump misguess by declarer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in that case possibilities to -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  E isn't willing to ask for a @c switch, not knowing what partner has in @c I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was declarer, after a transfer response to 1@C, at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if there is any possibility to defeat, it must be a @c ruff by E. Declarer can have @sKQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW missed the defense against 4@S - played by S: @H to K, @D to A Now @CK to A, @S to 8 and Q, @CJ to Q - but not @C again|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: now 9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: well played by W - he set up a trap - and N fall in|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and looking happily for the 10th|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@S is not good contract ... correct pass by Balicki ... |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ntmon: transfers don't fit much into the system, 1@D needs to be negative|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|danilo1: makin if he starts with @H first ... not impossible after @C lead |pg||
nt|dburn: he can play hearts now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|granguru:  looks that there is no way to win...no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  @DK ?|pg||
nt|peachy: There are 15 groups of 8 teams each, the top three (I think) will advance to the Swiss, from where top teams advance to KO etc|pg||
nt|peachy: This isnt quite making, I think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru:  what about small @d ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ntmon: anyway, 4@H good contract, will make|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: from each group|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: So the chance is missed.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: Ralf's analysis is good. It does seem that a club switch was indicated.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|danilo1: now not anymore ... now need @H 3-3 ... |pg||
pc|c4|nt|granguru:  at 6NT the reason is not to give the 12th trick ...normally declarer coudnt find a suit to play...so usually no long suit..if 12 tricks there, there is nothing to lose...but if just 11 you must be carefull not to give 1 trick on the lead.|pg||
nt|dburn: he's still all right|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  ans @s finesse--not @C|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|c8|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|royhughes: Here's a little bidding challenge for NS|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl = other suit (nothing about points)|pg||
mb|r|mb|2C|nt|heads: Dbl will help N-S|pg||
nt|royhughes: Let's see if Apteker's takeout double makes bidding a grand a little harder|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdl good hand (otherwise 2@d or other)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Dbl at 2@C 1leas or 4+ @C|pg||
nt|royhughes: If EW had not bid, I think the NS pair would have an easy auction to 7|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East not a good idea - N/S can use the time to know A in North|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Rdl = A @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or void|pg||
nt|royhughes: Usually the methods are a little less clear when the opponents are in the bidding|pg||
nt|heads: right!|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@d giving the support in @d|pg||
mb|4N|nt|royhughes: Supporting diamonds is important -- just what Bocchi needs to hear|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: this auction is STANDARD in Italy pair that play at high level|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|nt|fann4: Looks like they will reach 7 now|pg||
nt|fann4: 7@S I mean|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4N ia man't sure - can be rkbw in @S (4@S would be kcbw in @C)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Giorgio, are these general methods published anywhere?|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|fann4: Oh wait, maybe 4N is something else here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@h seam 2 key no Q - so probably 4n key in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5N ask about a plus value|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: (@D :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@D bid his Q|pg||
nt|fann4: Well, if the @DQ hasn't been show yet, then it's a big card.|pg||
nt|fann4: Giorgio, what was 4N?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7 @s now is correct|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4N i think fix @S and ask key cards|pg||
nt|royhughes: If 6@d shows extra diamond strength, the queen, then Bocchi knows he can probably pitch the heart loser|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm betting 7@S ( though I've lost hundreds of cokes this way)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S (instead) would fix @C asking key in @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5N ask about a value out bid cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course 4@s kcbw for @D (not @C :)|pg||
nt|fann4: 7@S in the CR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Bocchi is thinking about @S 4/1 - but i think he must call 7|pg||
nt|royhughes: For some players, 6@d might have been a suggested possible contract|pg||
nt|fann4: He can't worry about @S 4-1. |pg||
mb|6S|nt|bridge_one: Hhoiwever i amn't sure about 4@S (instead 4N) - many use 4@C to fix the minor asking cue and 4@d like kcbw in the minor (that i think is a good gadget)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Declarer might handle a 4-1 trump break by ruffing a club in the dummy -- there might be some problems with entries|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@S a surprise|pg||
nt|fann4: 13 imps to APT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7@S is a risk that must take|pg||
nt|royhughes: There are just so many more difficulties when the opponents bid|pg||
nt|royhughes: With no opposing bidding, I am sure North could have shown his hand type and had an easy time getting to 7|pg||
nt|royhughes: There was no opposing bidding in the other room|pg||

nt|granguru:  garozzo had another saying..when you have a singleton, lead it...|pg||
nt|granguru:  obviously at suit contracts|pg||
nt|peachy: It is one of his famous "Rules"|pg||
nt|granguru:  in general, it made life easier for the defense...if you didnt lead a singleton..you didnt have it...|pg||
nt|peachy: Another one of Garozzo's: "Must have a very good reason for not leading trump"|pg||
nt|danilo1: he knows that pd must have very good @S + need @HK + more than just A in @D ... if all this, Adam would not bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|danilo1: but if he played @H before cashing second trump ... than meight do|pg||
nt|runnerup: 7 @s  here|pg||
nt|runnerup: bidding test|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: ah a slam and a minor one at that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  openings are getting lighter and lighter, these days|pg||
nt|paulg:  his line did have a lot of play|pg||
mb|1S|nt|granguru:  well if @H behave he could have made it..but that would have mean @S were also 1-1 and the line should have been different|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but a good sacrifice too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: At Last tempo would have been better by @H ruffs. Hard to se for them|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@H? .. guess best bid|pg||
nt|dburn: key is South's diamond holding, but if South can get a diamond bid in before North bids Blackwood|pg||
nt|dburn: then North may be able to find what he needs to know|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not like Splinter with A .. as well as do not like 4@S with this distribution|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite an interesting one|pg||
nt|dburn: so 4@c-4@d-4NT-5@h-6@d (asking for third round control)|pg||
nt|danilo1: besides on 2@H may hear @D support and than key card (for @D!!!) |pg||
nt|dburn: despite that being a splinter with the stiff ace, it seems the best way for North to find out what he needs to find out|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see 4@C?|pg||
nt|dburn: he can't really bid 2@h - he would have the Devil's own job getting back to spades if South were to raise hearts|pg||
nt|danilo1: i would bid 2@H - cannot cost since I can allways corect @H contract to @S|pg||
nt|runnerup: dont see many choises|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pelu: top-players dont like the @d-suit :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@d must be relay for clarification, and 3@c shows no major probably|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will south bid 3NT with 3 small spades ?|pg||
nt|dburn: how is partner to know, after 1@d-1@s-2@h-3@h-3@s that you have four spades and two hearts, rather than five diamonds, four hearts and a spade cue bid?|pg||
nt|runnerup: and here it came|pg||
nt|danilo1: if pd has 3-card @D ... @DQ may bi vital card ... and therefore, I would like to hear @D fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2C prob Precision style, 5-6 clubs with possible 4-card major|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rcerreto:  tough lead|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  nothing appeals, @d looks normal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I know about 3700 people who would bid 2nt with east hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  as I said at the beginning ..probably @S finesse instead of a @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is 2s not forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed you would - but you cannot cope with a simple raise in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Mahaffey won the first match 17-13 against a team from Romania (with Bocchi-Maddala!?), Aspe lost 10-20 to a strong team from England|pg||
nt|granguru:  panski plays 4@H here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rcerreto:  leading the longest suit is always an option|pg||

nt|runnerup: who is the boss now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: good contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c more precise : no major and only one stopper ... South assumes the stopper is @s :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@H is I guess 3NT try ... Cezary knows how valid is @CQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: We have 4 diferent options by us 4 commentators. WHAT IS THE BEST BID AT E IN THE LONG TERM?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr.N|pg||
mb|5H|nt|paulg:  Bocchi-Madala are playing for Lavazza in another group, whatever the results page says|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: there is a little misunderstanding after explanation|pg||
nt|ntmon: protective X from W - can be really costly now|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi George|pg||
nt|danilo1: wha not ... than pd has 5-card @S ... so @DQ no more vital ... @HK instead ... again Key-card ... and final contract ... in @S|pg||
nt|runnerup: south took blacwood-so perhaps norht take 7|pg||
nt|danilo1: problem here is that they both need to chk what pd has in @D ... and they did not do it|pg||
nt|dburn: North can presumably show @dK and @sQ now|pg||
nt|runnerup: he should tell his card and all he still needs is Q @d |pg||
nt|dburn: but South can't count 13 tricks after that|pg||

nt|daman: Hi Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a 6-card suit @hK and a stiff @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade game needs to be bid.|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: I don't know that 1@H was right when East had indicated the majors.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe it was also meant to show real @c|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me a strong 3@s rise and an invite to 4@s|pg||

pc|c2|nt|granguru:  under this premise I agree fully..the same philosophy of the 6NT lead..dont give tricks away to declarer on the initial lead.|pg||
nt|granguru:  when you have points in all side suits normally declarer has a solid trump suit...|pg||
nt|ntmon: worked!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||

nt|peachy: Operator, 2C should have been down two, maybe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: surprising, that - their auction seemed well on track until the final bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D made against the 300 here, so a big swing to Badger.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was wondering if South would overcall 1@s, easier to overcall 1NT perhaps|pg||

nt|peachy: 1NT 12-16 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North was in 3NT at the other table, doubled and ran to 4@D.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be hearts and a minor, so North asks|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1NTx was sort of +380 but Soith escapes|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok: 2@d showed a 11-13 hand with 3@h. sry for this mess, but its really difficult to guess the meaning of ART bids. And its boring to be silent... :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not much point reaching New York - they need to stay in Poznan for a few more days|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: not the best lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3d could be makable but tokay wasnt sure about 5 cards @d|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS guessing can win 3@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1D! negative, 0-6(7) |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  do EW play transfer?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Transfers opposite 1@C are popular.|pg||
nt|granguru:  we will see a good fight here|pg||
nt|granguru:  as 2@S is a difficult contract to win|pg||
nt|ntmon: or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: With four aces missing, it seems that the three-level may be high enough.|pg||
nt|pelu: that the problem with 1@D opening - partner dont know if u have 2 or 5 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 4@s - but US never found the @s-fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  mmm|pg||
nt|granguru:  Does S have nothing clear  to lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: and Lauria does not give up|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok this looks obvious here :) |pg||
nt|riccho:  15 vs. 8 HCP --> both players are a bit exaggerating their hands|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: Not knowing their system, North's Pass might have included better hands, and wek hands run immediately via Rdbl, that is one way of playing|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure how obvious is 3NT by East ... he is min, and 2 open suits ... OK, has 3 tens and 5-card @C ... still|pg||
nt|riccho:  now decl has 9 tricks in his bag. I c no other option than to play for @c to be 3-3 (or Hx somewhere). |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong lead .... and big diff. |pg||
nt|dburn: one more round of the Swiss, and both teams occupying places in the low teens with 27 qualifiers|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: Obviously East had read West for a much better hand than he holds.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: and I can´t see why...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|riccho:  E needs 33 in @c without alternative, because due to communication problems he has to duck @c immediately |pg||
nt|ntmon: looks like 1@D showing @h, 1@S nat forcing, 2@C weak preference, 2@H good hand|pg||
nt|daman: makes sense to me|pg||
nt|dburn: so both of them are well enough placed not to think about heading to New York (or Australia) just yet|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ntmon: i like transfer responses to 1@C - room for many gadgets|pg||
nt|daman: yes |pg||
nt|daman: I don't think 1@D was a transfer   I think just a negative over the big club|pg||
nt|daman: <7|pg||
nt|runnerup: club ruff -diamond ruff and club ruft with j@h gives chances to defence|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: Such a shame to lose IMPs unnecessarily when there are so many other ways of losing IMPs.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  could W consider his hand balanced?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then open 1NT (or rebidding, if 1NT is weak)?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was presumably non-forcing, so it is hard to see how East had enough to look for an 11-trick game.|pg||
nt|granguru:  well he treated the  hand as a croos ruffing type|pg||
nt|granguru:  and protected potential @d tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Protected diamond tricks I think|pg||
nt|ntmon: then 2@C doesn't make much sense |pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: If 1@s is´nt spades, 1nt from W looks normal for me |pg||
nt|murat: 9 tricks i guess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another claim i daresay|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|danilo1: ideal def. is I guess -3 ... now  making .. @SAK and small @C|pg||
pc|d6|nt|granguru:  now he is not so sure anymore....|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep ... may be here they are in some "hole" of their system|pg||
pc|dT|nt|peachy: Although, 2D foes not necessarily promise 4+ diamonds|pg||
nt|daman: it does seem starange|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s seems to have shown hearts - some Italian pairs swap 1@h and 1@s around after this start to the bidding|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|peachy: In my opinion, the range 12-16 is susceptible to trouble at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: kib says my suggeswted method is common in Hungary, but we still dont know if NS play that way|pg||
nt|riccho:  with 23 HCP and no fit you have to be lucky to succeed in 3NT... |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong = unlucky (lead) |pg||
nt|daman: strange*|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|granguru:  as we see, he changed his mind but fortunatelly N had a @S left|pg||
nt|peachy: if EW play 2/1 (which I do not know if they do)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|danilo1: waw :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  leading and slam bidding are the most expensive parts of team playing. This is another proof of that... |pg||
nt|danilo1: did he really believe that Cezary would play @C from Jxx?|pg||
nt|riccho:  declarer - much to his discomfort - found another way of handling the @c suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry gotg held up|pg||
nt|daman: Hi John|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|ntmon: hi John|pg||
nt|dburn: other pairs use double to promise hearts, and 1@h to show spades|pg||
nt|dburn: some antedliuvian folk persist in bidding the suits they have, but they're all in Swiss B by now|pg||
nt|danilo1: what would happe if North did not ruff, @DK, but discrad @S instead?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: I was asked twice the question "what are these people doing here" :)  probably looking at the strane flag combinations|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this is the European Opan Championship|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Open|pg||
nt|granguru:  excelent defense after all|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|danilo1: Adam will resolve problem ... if declar would have @HK, he will not be in hurry with @S unblock|pg||
nt|riccho:  decl may have trusted the length signal from S (it it was one...). DoesnÂ´t he know Balicki - Zmudzinski then? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: hiya |pg||

pc|h2|nt|granguru:  panski wished he would have been in dummy now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|chmitty: As usual, Lauria "manipulates" his cards for his best benefit and will claim 8 tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure - may gain a trick, but this looks one down at any rate|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is good as well|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|brolucius: Going two down may make it seem a bit less of a disappointment.|pg||

nt|runnerup: you need take @d ruff here|pg||
nt|dburn: but it may not be so easy for West to lead a diamond - still, he has so little that he may see a ruff as the best chance to beat the hand|pg||

nt|chmitty: let's see if declarer finds the way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: a @c at trick 2 would reveal most of the layout|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: Plenty to think about before playing trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  oops|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Both losing semifinalists are awarded bronze medals. There is no playoff for third place (a good decision in my view)|pg||
nt|brolucius: East hoping for a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, 3rd-4th place finals are dull|pg||
nt|brolucius: But neither team has a bronze medal in their sights at this moment.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  winning A and playing a @h back would have forced S to play trumps but...|pg||
nt|danilo1: to lead for ruff is good when one has blank hand|pg||
nt|dburn: and if North-South keep bidding black suits, a diamond will look more and more clear|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|murat: for a save or for some money|pg||
nt|jcomyn: missin just the KQ10876 of trumps|pg||
nt|daman: over 2@S   North could have bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ntmon: if N was afraid 1@H being passed out, should have bid 2@H|pg||
nt|daman: or    South could simply have bid 2@D over 1@S|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would bring 2@S if S has them for sure|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ntmon: i would feel elevated with S hand as such and did some cunning bidding, at least 4@D splinter |pg||

nt|pelu: that a DD analyse|pg||
nt|danilo1: still ... -2 |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|riccho:  Helgemo helness agreed with the bidding in bd 6 (but not in the play: +14 imps for monaco z)|pg||
nt|dburn: and besides, why should he play the ten and set up South's eight when, left to his own devices, South will play West for the ten anyway?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: if u X for 1 down odds are against u: 3 / 5 IMP|pg||
nt|murat: right|pg||
nt|pelu: vuln and 2 / 5 non vuln|pg||
nt|MolvaM: baldursson has too many high cards and has to defend carefully to avoid being thrown in|pg||
nt|murat: he should win with the king now|pg||
nt|chmitty: I think he is wrong : Versace would not easily raise to 2@h with xxx cards|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Can you stand another nail-biter, David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I have taken my pills.|pg||
nt|pelu: sorru on East|pg||
nt|granguru:  panski is trying to cash all defensive tricks bfore it is too late|pg||
nt|chmitty: a nice "challenge the champs" deal here|pg||
nt|chmitty: 7@h = 20/20|pg||
nt|runnerup: an other 6 for Apteker last board ns in 3 @c not doubled but down 3|pg||
mb|1D|nt|peachy: Kamil's team is listed as transnational, not USA, in the event|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  S multi 2@D|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for Meckwell in the other room (probably not the last time we'll say that in this championship)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  I've noticed many pairs treat the Multi 2@d as weak with spades when it comes to their 2nd seat defence|pg||
nt|pelu: and 5@H close to make on a small @S-lead |pg||
nt|paulg:  it's rare to see that in the UK, but would work here|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@h from North?|pg||
nt|ntmon: krajewski in the meantime gains with a series of mid-sized profits|pg||
nt|daman: must be a canape opening|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk3: No credit for my hy-phen?|pg||
nt|pelu: for D = balanced 12-15 or any 16+|pg||
nt|pelu: for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  Amoil played for SA in the world teams in bermuda 2000 |pg||
nt|peachy: really light third-seater here|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: i thought that he is from Usa becouse he doesn't exist in EBL base|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  that is the norm in the UK too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|ntmon: strong @C variety, finally|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@d will be 'bid your major' (4@c would have been transfer to your major)|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes many play 2@D x= short in @S |pg||
nt|daman: this auction should show longer @Ss than @Ds|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: wd by West|pg||
nt|granguru:  and 2@d - 2@h 5+ @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is similar to the situation in the Open Room, where West doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: forcing pass in N?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And done we are|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Be careful because jtr is watching.|pg||
nt|granguru:  now a correct flag in W ...thanks Michal|pg||
nt|peachy: and another 16+ 1C here, maybe they have additional agreements on what constitutes a 1C opening that we do not know about |pg||
nt|ntmon: XX = transfer to @H ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: ??? dbl from me as E|pg||
nt|paulg:  surely not a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmmm 24 hcp and want to defend 1s - verybrave|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but East help him, in on @CK he played @D - ruff, @C to A @S to 10 and duck - and now endplayed - East sh play @C back and no endplay|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rcerreto:  a cheap save on 4@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S has escaped a double, but the cards lie well for declarer so the lack of a double will not cost E/W much.|pg||
nt|granguru:  In the meanwhile NS surpassed the safet level of 5@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  is 6@C makeable?|pg||
nt|granguru:  after A GAROZZO's lead|pg||
nt|peachy: on the surface, looks like just lose a spade, whether the tricks are there is another matter|pg||
nt|peachy: Kib who knows NS style says they love to surprise opps with frequent tactical bids|pg||
nt|riccho:  1 trick in every suit for ew = just make|pg||
nt|dburn: nervous for South - the kind of hand where if you overcall and get doubled, you know you are going down a lot against nothing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|danilo1: despite 3NT looks makable for NS ... good defense should beat it ... so good stop|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/CGlossary/canape.html|pg||

nt|runnerup: @d in time means now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: but still a dbl....|pg||
nt|granguru:  2 discards on reds|pg||
nt|chmitty: as long as they do not surprise themselves that's fine :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: why not - u have bid game Red against green |pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: its for me a good standard rule|pg||
nt|chmitty: Full brakes on, from North's standpoint|pg||
nt|chmitty: South has a lot ... can he give up ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 6 controls opposite strong club, he just cant pass|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: choice of plays - hate thast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably play on d and postpone finesses|pg||
nt|ntmon: on  17, meckwell started as reccomended: 1@S-2N-4@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps @H finesse, if ducked revert to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: little point in ducking|pg||
nt|ntmon: not an easy hand due to communication problems|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so many choices|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Had the cards lain differently, not doubling might have waved goodbye to 500 or so.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may have feared a third-hand opener, but her side was vulnerable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not know that partner holds 10 points, so he cannot double 4@S even with an extra value or so. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but shouldn´t E?|pg||
nt|pelu: now N can make 1NT - topplay @Hs and only 6 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  3 discards on reds sorry|pg||
nt|granguru:  one @S given up|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk3: The contract is doubled at both tables in the other match|pg||
nt|granguru:  so just one ruff needed|pg||
nt|peachy: It is also possible that 4S was RKC|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: vugraph schedule for future matches    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: Quite right.|pg||
nt|chmitty: May be 4@s was kind of blackwood|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|peachy: it does make|pg||
nt|granguru:  not even garozzo beats 6@c here|pg||
nt|petergill: NS needs to get their @d trick before the @h are set up|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he can't pass - and even when del Monte can pass, he often doesn't|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: WD White House team|pg||
nt|peachy: It would be nice if in a competition of this level, there were convention cards available|pg||
nt|chmitty: true :(|pg||
nt|chmitty: True also that there are many pairs in competition : huge job|pg||
nt|peachy: It makes kibitzing so much nicer, to know what the auction means|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chmitty: a suggestion could be that the players had to fill themselves an "electronic convention card" before the championship|pg||
nt|ntmon: right, John :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: its a headache hand |pg||
nt|ntmon: agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: d suit may die now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chmitty: that will come soon, I'm sure|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|murat: he should played the Ace @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: N with shut down with XX showing @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: and just did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont think he found the best line entries are very short for finessing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant even get a s if d is returned|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  it is a good standard rule for me too, but not when one hand has pre-empted|pg||
nt|petergill: Good @S play - now S has to decide - @HQ or @DK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: Now East may grab @CA.|pg||
nt|dburn: chances are that since East didn't double here South might get the clubs wrong|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|runnerup: south missed another chance|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|murat: now he's in trouble|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: for me "multi" is nor real preemt - just a semicontructiv opening bid|pg||
nt|dburn: unusual, that - South's concentration may have slipped for a moment|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: wrong @hA ok if 3-3 and @H 10 nevber correct|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||

nt|dburn: risk? what risk?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to risk a double in the first place.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: An excellent 6@D now|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer could have the singleton king of clubs only if she had about ten cards rather than thirteen|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  can declarer have one more @d one less @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on NS - a nice contract|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  N was declarer, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In theory, there is a club ruff, but fortunately for declarer, the defender with the singleton club also has @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting bidding test. If they bid it, I will applaud.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C is more tricky and that might be reached.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They may arrive in 6@C, though|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With problems on a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can they make 1C after a @c lead? I doubt|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the sort of board we were hoping for. No-one wants these matches to be decided on small margins after some drab boards.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @s lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c after a @s lead....|pg||
nt|peachy: In "real" championships, I think that is how it is done, these championships are open to anybody who wants enter from anywhere in the world, no qualification required|pg||
nt|danilo1: running scores now on: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|riccho:  a matter of style and system if u open the N hand with 1@c 2@c or 3@c|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: If one side wins after doing better on the big boards, then good luck to them - (even if they are not from England)|pg||
nt|murat: that was unexpected|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the contract went both ways during play and finally declarer came out as the winner|pg||
nt|paulg:  Seeing your partner pass when you have a balanced zero count is never good|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table on Bd 7: East bid 2@S after 1@H P 2@C, so W led @S to 4@H|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|pelu: 34 HCP - I exp slam with most tables|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s now from South?|pg||
nt|peachy: And teams can have members from any country = all transnational|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C precision style ... part of Polish @C system|pg||
nt|dburn: then, this match may be close to a tie after 7 and 8 are scored|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  so a precision like 2@c opening here |pg||
mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays @d before havinc cleaned trumps, another @s will set up a trumph trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Imagine winning the board with 3NT.|pg||

nt|brolucius: not beat 6@C, I mean|pg||
nt|dburn: a result with which both teams will be quite happy - it won't hurt either's chances for qualification|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: true!|pg||

nt|chmitty: Lauria could hold : Kx KQ10xxx x Kxxx whixh would produce an excellent slam|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: Declarer does not know how hearts sit so he might duck one, but as it is, does not matter|pg||
nt|riccho:  or?|pg||
nt|riccho:  it helps: decl can develop 3 tricks in @s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: bidding on bd 18 has taken off to 4nt already|pg||
nt|petergill: If NS can lock declarer out of dummy, 3@H will fail|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: would u X in West or bid 2Nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would have started with 2@d (inverted) personally, even if showing your 4-card major first seems to be growing in popularity|pg||
nt|daman: it isn't so much what they can make    can they reasonably bid over the 4@H opening?|pg||

nt|chmitty: Lauria considering his options in case @h are 4-1|pg||
nt|peachy: there are 15 groups of 8 teams each|pg||
nt|chmitty: only danger to consider|pg||
nt|chmitty: ha can : a) play Ace @h and @h or b) play small @h to retain an extra entry in dummy or c) unblock @s ace and run Q @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no of course not unless someone doubles|pg||
nt|runnerup: go down |pg||
nt|dburn: they can do that all right - but a shift to @c9 might have been a trick more effective|pg||

nt|danilo1: lol :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: srry, private|pg||
nt|runnerup: south sees dummy -so i cant understand any but @s |pg||
nt|petergill: I think 27 teams qualify from Swiss A (i.e. this Section) and 5 from Swiss B, into the 28 board Knockout matches.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if @S and @S now ... Thk Giorgio will play on @HK doubleton|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: but then u would mis a 4-4 fit in @H - pd could be 4-4-3-2|pg||

nt|daman: correct|pg||
pc|s4|nt|murat: dbl i guess|pg||
nt|pelu: for 100% 2NT|pg||

nt|danilo1: @C continuation would beat|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: @cQ and @S back and Tokay will regret that he used his only entry to dummy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kibs are shocked... to play clubs from hand is purely double dummy. he cant do that|pg||
nt|pelu: but against storng defense his plan sh fail|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he can hope that @cA is with north but very hard to play for both honors to be there|pg||
nt|pelu: if S has showed distrbution in the black suits - and easy defense for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well some days even 2 club tricks could be enough|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could catch the @dQ|pg||
nt|murat: he's hopeless now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so to play for @cQx inside is not a terrible play|pg||

pc|s8|nt|fann4: Yes:)|pg||
nt|heads: and a @C back -1|pg||
nt|fann4: Hang on - this is a killer lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C would beat|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fann4: Potentially, but N has to switch a @C.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but impossible to make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the swtich @C is possible|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and i think Bocchi will make|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, Allerton-Leslie will think that they may have had a very big board.|pg||
nt|pelu: same did N :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would be bidding hearts on the next round|pg||
nt|granguru:  I think it is the correct way |pg||
nt|pelu: yes and that would show @H-stopper and bad @ss|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem - at boprt tables was Ss bold @s-bid|pg||
nt|chmitty: last board for today|pg||
nt|daman: last board of this set now|pg||
nt|ntmon: hard to predict if -200 is a loss or a profit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|riccho:  he might have tried to endplay N with @sA and another|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a push|pg||
nt|daman: or 3 IMPs to NS|pg||
nt|ntmon: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A question of RKCB when the spade fit comes to light.|pg||
nt|ntmon: jassem lucky on  17 where 5@S went down, so gain for udertricks at both rooms|pg||
nt|jcomyn: push i say|pg||
mb|1D|nt|MolvaM: for kibs who ask|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the other table scores are unreachable|pg||
nt|murat: Lavazza should get the comfortable lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but lavaza leads by a comfortable margin of approx 30 imps|pg||
nt|daman: I have to leave now   see you for the next session    and    thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Thank you kibitzers, ope you enjoyed.  And thank you for your active participation with comments and questions, we are all here ONLy for you.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: 4@c from me as W|pg||
nt|Walddk3: So Zimmermann by 6 in a minute|pg||
nt|pelu: sory a solid win for Lawazza - my calculations (:)) 37-1|pg||
nt|chmitty: ty Raija :)@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Multon won the diamond at trick 2 and paused for a while before he played another spade|pg||
nt|runnerup: close match again -partscore swing last board |pg||
nt|petergill: These two teams running 11th and 14th right now: ref http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: E/W fighting bravely, but hard to imagine that it will be successfully.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that looked like broadcasting a football match on radio :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D must have promised @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a very normal way to bid on Ns hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  I played Mahaffey on vugraph in last year's Rosenblum ... luckily Meckwell were in Nickell's team on that occasion|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: All good pairs will know what to do after intervention over 4NT (in theory....)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Vriend team on their way to the final; 32-9 after a slam swing on board 23, like here|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand now, thanks to our operator Michal for a great job! Also thanks to EBL for getting these great matches shown on BBO.|pg||
nt|peachy: Also thanks to our opearor for a great job!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: it was a reasonnable 6@c slam here but that will be for another day :) SO enjoy your evening (day) and see you tomorrow|pg||
mb|3D|nt|murat: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract in OR|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and will gain on 18 as well - odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the open event at this stage consists of short matches of 10 boards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so this is the last hand of the segment|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzers, you are the life of this party, appreciate all your comments and questions!|pg||
nt|dburn: not much in this, I guess - a club lead might beat 3NT, but I can't see why South would lead a club|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulg:  I think 1NT as semi-forcing is quite popular, where North might pass 1NT?|pg||
nt|riccho:  some work here for decl to deny 6 defensive tricks here|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice lead by Martens|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hate that bidding - cant find a 4-4 s fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: would be a nice lead against 4@S if reached|pg||
nt|ntmon: another odd gain on  20 - on missinng the right contract?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the world-wide disease - find some level of nt as soon as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: The official site has a score of 30-27 in this match. Not easy to know what to believe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cronier may fear a diamond ruff in 6@S, because he has offered the lower-scoring slam with excellent spade support.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to our commentators peter lund, and murat anter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and our operator michal |pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: and our kibitzers|pg||

nt|dburn: careful play by Bach - Duboin was going to put in the @d8, so it was as well that North didn't let him|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|riccho:  typical safety play situation here in @s to lose only one trump trick|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|runnerup: tx all again -good match a lot off nice boards to discuss|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: there are stars from each country|pg||
nt|MolvaM: including all europeans|pg||

nt|MolvaM: but better check later with the website|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.poznan2011.pl/results|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for instance here, 2@C generally shows 4+ for meck and 3+ for roddy :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulg:  interesting difference in styles|pg||
nt|paulg:  I thought these top pairs/teams were supposed to simulate these situations and get a consensus|pg||
nt|pelu: how do they explai that on CC?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|danilo1: tk -1 ... opening @H trick to def |pg||
nt|riccho:  but there are as usual other considerations to make as well|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bigtrain: its a matter of style|pg||
nt|danilo1: now cash 2@C |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|paulg:  well, kokish at least|pg||
