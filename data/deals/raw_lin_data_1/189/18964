nt|kiwibridge: it needed p-p-x to trouble him which seldom happens|pg||
nt|benjy:  in the CR I would have opened 1NT as north, opening 1@S creates a big rebid problem, if east had led a trump (which is normal) then that would have had little chance|pg||

nt|mamos: the defence is helpless  because although declarer cannot force an entry to dummy the defence must provide one|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bagman: the -50 EW paid is 50 better than the par (4@DX -100); might earn a couple of IMPs|pg||
nt|jbgood: you can follow the intense fight for a place in the Round of 32 here: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda7.html|pg||
nt|stc: everybody 1NT with E's hand ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bagman: Cannot X and do not like passing |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: Dangerous, sure, but the Opps steal you blind if you pass with that|pg||
nt|jbgood: i would rather double - too little intermediates|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: most European pairs would act with West either Multi or Weak Two|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: so a forcing NT from South  and a rather uncomfortable 3-3 partscore :(|pg||
pc|c3|nt|stc: looks like -2 or -3|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|stc: I am also for X, AJxx and Axx in majors look OK|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bagman: We might discuss about the relative merits of X and 1NT for quite long. In my opinion both have flaws and it's just the matter of taste and style|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes, me too|pg||
nt|jbgood: Consus went down at both tables on the prev one - so another 4 imps for kaninen|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|benjy:  In fact you always need the @H hook so grand is not a good proposition|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but 12 cold in NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|benjy:  True|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy:  Interesting that west chose to rebid 2NT over 2@C than raise @C directly|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|benjy:  perhaps that would deny a balanced hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: keycard from E would have got 3 then he can ask for Q|pg||
mb|5N|nt|benjy:  Or perhaps 2@C is artificial, since he bid it on a 2 card suit, but perhaps they don't have an artificial @D raise|pg||

nt|benjy:  Just because 13 tricks are available via a finesse (in 7@D) doesn't mean that you want to be in it, although Roland might disagree! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: schedule in your zone :) http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|benjy:  You can make 13 in NT too but that requires the @Cs to play for 4 tricks as well as the @H hok|pg||
nt|benjy:  hook|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: Bompis is still thinking :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all will settle for 6 it's a question of suit or NT|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjy:  If west held the same hand with the @CJ then grand would be good right?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kiwibridge: oooj gone all the way and can't help but make|pg||
nt|benjy:  but perhaps he would bid grand anyway, i don't think Bompis has shown 5@D on this auction and perhaps that's why he jumped to grand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: the live scores are great thanks Maria|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: np :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|benjy:  I don't agree with 7@D but it does have the merit of making, i think for this to be cold Bompis needed his pd to hold Ax Axx KQxx KQJx|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||

mb|p|nt|benjy:  could it be void showing? that is a relatively common treatment too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much of an opening though not for me|pg||
nt|benjy:  if it is void showing then south has a big hand now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be 1st round|pg||
nt|benjy:  Minimum i agree, but i would open it with such good suits|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: grand reached via the slow route|pg||
nt|benjy:  Grand bid and made in the CR|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I dream of such hands as N, esp when pard opens|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjy:  ok no problems now, Fallenius recognised that he had almost 100% working cards (in this case honours outside of @Cs) so he co-operated|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: the same in CR :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|benjy:  I'm not convinced by the CR auction i think north just potted it in the end|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: very true anyone ever see 20+20|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|panja: I am not sure 1@S was a good beginning|pg||
nt|panja: now..N will need to set up @H and force...and that is not easy after a 1 level response|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and s has no aces so will be reluctant to force anything|pg||

nt|mamos: in a club or local event you might just bid 7@h after 1@h and shrug your shoulders while facing dummy|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: probably best approach|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|panja: I guess she will take the plunge anyway|pg||
