nt|jbgood: right guess to make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: i cannot find a CC for EW sry :(|pg||
nt|jbgood: we appreciate your efforts, Hedy:)|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|grebrof: give away the trump|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@C in Open so probably a flat start|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: ruff and discard never obvious|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|grebrof: nothing wrong about this line|pg||
nt|mamos: It is a tough day   lots of boards - slow tempo  - moving around - distractions - some pairs not in contention - others desperately fighting   - it's not surprising that it is ...|pg||
nt|mamos: varied|pg||
nt|jcomyn: say those two names together quickly you get tongue tied|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||

nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oqfrunda1.html|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|mamos: EW have no need to regret giving in to Diamonds  they could make nothing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sunsamvar: hi Hans|pg||
nt|mamos: Ns will bid 3NT   in any language|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed but they didnt look as if they would find a major fit|pg||
nt|yke:  W should have played low and East should have throw the K under spade Ace, not that easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee here we go again with ultra-light opening|pg||
nt|yke:  but it's only for an overtrick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how many clubs|pg||
nt|yke:  nice hand :) |pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD 4@H easy but SD impossible to make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And on a @D-lead - overtricks?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: i like that|pg||
nt|yke:  I don't like 3NT, with a void|pg||
nt|jcomyn: banking on a d leade|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hawe45:  Rather easy boards to start with here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi/morning(sunshine up here North|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: pls who is Thomas operator?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: N is Thomas|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|grebrof: 3@s is not an underbid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially vul very aggressive stuff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NOOOOO|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: Double -dummy 3NT ... but guess would not find @DK|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sunsamvar: will they get to 6 here ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If so - 6 @H D is free for 1100|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 the 1400 and 1 IMP|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult to find out, how bad slam is|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D= 11-18 nat or 11-15 4 4 4 1, 1 4 4 4  or 11-21 2suiter with @d|pg||
nt|jbgood: the closest we get to a system "bank" is that of Ecats I think, but on occasions like this we surely miss a place to find whatever CC we want - to which all pairs playing ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: internationally should contribute|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: defence to 4@h not trivial|pg||
mb|2S|nt|grebrof: playing 4@s wouldnt be either|pg||
nt|grebrof: missing the AK of trumps, not always fun|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well ca ruff and h ak|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: see the one earlier missing ak of trumps slam|pg||
nt|mamos: S probably has to rise with @hA  and play Club|pg||
nt|grebrof: I actually played 6@hs with single A vs my Ps single K|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes that would be great!|pg||
nt|jbgood: a challenge for the WBF|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: gm Hans|pg||
nt|hedyg: though i am sure if i spoke Dutch somewhere on the NBF site...|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eamongall: good afternoon |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: cue bidding no doubt|pg||
nt|grebrof: you know - the multi|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Team NONACO might be M-onaco|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: hello|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yke:  what about double with the East hand? I think one of them will run|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yes the Slam missing AK of trumps was the result of RKCB and a 5@s response which pinpointed two missing KC when the agreed suit was @h|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: It is, sry for that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Z = Zimmermann...|pg||
nt|danilo1: mini NT ... North is still not giving up slam ...  ... need not to go over 4NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: can give ruff?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: J10xx wouldnt happen to me|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: uses will bid this in two bids but maybe we are oldfashioned. They take 9 bids to get to the most unobvious contract u ever saw|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT was 11-14|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks as if the 19 ciount aint finished yet|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in open also 5@CX-3 I presume|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is going to be expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Piekarek forgot system|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: oh i hear in open 5@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eamongall: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html    open teams running scores seem up |pg||
nt|yke:  but maybe to 5@C :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|grebrof: very nice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a real quare one - p opens 2d multi and you have void h and 7 spades - what was my partners suit|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep. One of my many most embarassing moments|pg||
nt|eamongall: good evening kacper |pg||
nt|danilo1: well ... if South decides to open .. in nat. system, may not be so easy for North to stop ... here ... mini NT and relays should have advantage ... seems North not using them|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: now 10 bids which comes from opening weak|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so french a lot of imps to start with|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some 12 imps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 13 can|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|grebrof: my P had 6 @hs and 3 @s after my multi and jumped to 4@s - what was my suit?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big question around - who was the idiot who played in 2s+5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thast makes things easy |pg||
nt|hedyg: oh!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|danilo1: in Open room .. 3NT made bd one ... after East's Dble ... and @H cashed ... West already exposed 5Hcp ... so @DK found|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: y a good player does not make more than 8 tricks in @H (a bad player at least 9 or 10):)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: should bid 2nt no 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he not show 11-15 5+@Ds?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: 2nt is with 3s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  Small @D = no isk|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice @C duck|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  risk|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: Hi - Helgeness were in 5@c doubled|pg||
nt|hedyg: because 1@H/@S over 1@d can be 3+|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sunsamvar: wd have given problems if @S was 4-1|pg||
nt|fokal: seems it was better to play a @c after the first @d|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: bonjour Oliv :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mamos: eleven tricks |pg||
pc|s5|nt|fokal: only because AK of @s and KQ of are onside|pg||
nt|fokal: bonjour|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes very lucky|pg||
nt|fokal: of @h|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|nt|fokal: here it won't work|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|danilo1: probably 11 tricks .... @S 3-3|pg||
nt|fokal: S will eventualkly get squeezed on AK of @s|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: now @s and it works?|pg||

nt|grebrof: that we all agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to be spades|pg||
nt|jcomyn: never was justice in this game|pg||
nt|grebrof: NS at 18th - EW 21|pg||
nt|grebrof: these are just below 50%|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would you believe i wasnt the only idiot at the tabler. The clown on my right had 8 hearts - and PASSED 2d. I had an excuse|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: We are waiting for NS|pg||
nt|grebrof: standings: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
nt|grebrof: thank you for info, Kacper |pg||
nt|grebrof: I also passed with 8 @hs once - I had Q8765432 and single @c A - multi before me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well i suppose you had a good reason nto to reveal to lho which suit his partner has|pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe - I passed the whole board and scored 65% or so|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu Rex:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another expensive ready|pg||
nt|fokal: then S was doomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: bad splits all round|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|eamongall: bessis got 16 in round 1 and Nyshchyi got 10 |pg||
nt|yke:  hi jon|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls see OPEN b2 i do not get 5@H bid N    do you??|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Never - bot thatÂ´s too late, NL|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Nwever ever|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And here: NEVER a Multi - bad suit, can play in minors|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Never|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eamongall: strong NT and transfer and probably play 2@S ... or as it is 1NT |pg||
nt|jcomyn: another light opening wont work|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Probably in board 2, 6 @C is the best slam|pg||
nt|eamongall: personally I would attempt to play 2@S but I am not in Poznan |pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: i cannot see any way to make 4@h on this board even if the defence fail to get a Spade ruff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i am not bidding 2c on that hand to let opps have a cheap bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lucky West - North could (should) have waitet one round|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: an interesting - and unusual outcome of the Multi, opps play in opener's suit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But anyway - this board will be played in @S at most tables, but...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: without 2@D endresult could well be 4@H down|pg||
mb|3N|nt|grebrof: 3nt doesnt make either|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: they sit on wrong line - NS should be EW |pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: it does not matter TD said|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok, EW at 18th and NS 21|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 4@H X -2 will be on scoreboard I quess|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: WHY CANT YOU LEAD MY SUIT howls e|pg||
nt|jbgood: brekka is an imaginative player - but will have problems here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45:  North could even have hands, where 4 @S had a play - and where 1 NT was a bad spot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S in 3NT in OR|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: not sure why w bids with such defence against hearts|pg||
pc|dA|nt|grebrof: I would lead @ds|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s,s,s ruff goodnight|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh yes of course u dont have any|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt not much chance either|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mamos: youve been peeking John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and with a 5-3 fit ns maye have problems|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hawe45:  Strange - it seems, that 2 @S costs 100 - in both camps|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: very true|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but i have been getting the defence right all day. Such an easy game when u can see the 4 hands|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|danilo1: this should go down ... unfortunate lead ...|pg||

nt|danilo1: good recovery .. so -2|pg||

pc|c8|pc|h4|pc|s7|pc|dT|pg||

nt|vugraphpl9: short break|pg||
nt|danilo1: as expected .. Bd2, difficult to stop Norrt in Nat system .. .(6NT -1) |pg||
nt|mamos: pause?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well if you open with rubbish you cant complain|pg||
nt|jbgood: Kaninen (in 5th) up against the group leader|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks flat...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: ok, ty Kacper|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr: both 6@D +1?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not sdure i see the point of 3h|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jbgood: sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But if you bid on to 7 @D, you canÂ´t lose it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, Grand against the odds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 NT should be the contract, I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Now there is a slim 1@S but the preemptive value ovr 1@C might make it worth it ...and being a passed hand |pg||
nt|eamongall: the combined 13 count is bullying the 27 count for now |pg||
nt|eamongall: but 4@Hs is a comfortable outcome for NS |pg||
nt|yke:  in the south hand ofcourse|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way to get to @c fit i guess|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos:  It is easy for us oldies to look at the South hand and sneer at opening such a barren 11 count and attribute this to the failure of the Slam but all the modern experts play like ...|pg||
nt|mamos: this so must succeed |pg||
nt|mcarroll: But makes|pg||

nt|jcomyn: n does not meet the 20-standard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 10 even|pg||
nt|eamongall: a @D will need to appear 1st or 2nd trick to hold to 10 tricks |pg||

nt|vugraphpl9: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oqfrunda1.html|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|grebrof: Einarsson - Efraimsson leading still - now at 58% Ovidio at 2nd with 55% (roughly)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like reopening Dbles 10/11+ last position over 1NT (especially strong NT) ... they may gain a lot ... and loose a little (in teams, ev. -180 is not that tragedy)|pg||
nt|jbgood: scienfitic approaches not the strongest point in this partnership|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will he duck the d or play for a being right|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Or without @C-switch, when you get the @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S Ace...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: amazing how it begins to tighten up to this extent|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty Kacper and all specs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: 4@s may look better - but 3 NT also makes|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok can we change to 4@s now?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: more imps to Bessis|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C back would be a test...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3 most likely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: play simple @SJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some specs think 2@S made   it can but unlikely imo|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3 or 5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: QAxK :(|pg||
nt|danilo1: can we call @D6 Lavinthal?|pg||
nt|hedyg: will van Prooijen play the Q@S now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no :(|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sunsamvar: and NS making 3 @H|pg||
nt|jbgood: a hasty king kong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: Monaco running away from Rosenthal - the other 2 matches dead even http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oqfrunda1.html|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos: NS need to be careful here or a really hopeless contract will make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  6 so-calle top-losers makes it difficult to make. @C now, at least 500 is likely|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky cards for Piekarek|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  Correct now: @C Queen|pg||

pc|s8|nt|jaapfr: i vote for 22-9:)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But I would NOT put my money on at bet, deciding whether the @D-shift should really be better than a @C...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|mamos: scoring appears to have stalled a little|pg||
nt|jbgood: but would have gone down even if ducked - unless E cashes the ace|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|jbgood: or could he eliminate side suits?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i think it can be made|pg||

pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: @CJ??|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: yes|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jaapfr: @CJ was an illusion card|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ItÂ´s narrow - but the right minor-shift at trick 2 must be THE minor, where East is supposed to be shortest = less risk of discards|pg||

nt|jcomyn: 1D? am i seeing things|pg||
nt|danilo1: very nice 6@C ... but will north ever bid @C?|pg||
nt|mamos: 8+ I guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: i.e. 4+ cards, can have longer suit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45:  In practice, 5 @H D costs only 100|pg||
nt|mamos: NS have 6@c  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes you want p to lead DK against s|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, third hand (not that I like it)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i hate it|pg||
nt|danilo1: more interesting I guess is to discuss North first bid ... I agree that he is vounerable an in unpleasant second position ... still guess, I would not pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a slam at last|pg||
mb|3S|nt|grebrof: ok, weaknt|pg||
nt|mamos: what should N do now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c looks like relay|pg||
nt|jbgood: first half he opened 1 @s with 4@s and 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Best lead if doubled: @S KING!|pg||
nt|eamongall: well I think it will be bought in 5@HX|pg||
nt|danilo1: only 4@C? ... pd may pass that|pg||
nt|mamos: Seems hard for S to have any idea what N has|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he did bid 4|pg||
nt|danilo1: he is lucky pd 18 ... + 5@H ... so no pass probably|pg||
nt|danilo1: I would bid 4@D - and over expected 4@H, 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone open the n hand|pg||
nt|danilo1: me|pg||
nt|danilo1: and 1@C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not rigt - with A-Q-x byt South, itÂ´s a well-known trap!|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I ask for majors even with that - maybe the other hand can ruff when we have @s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  right|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eamongall: there goes the weak 2 bidding again|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4NT is I guess to play |pg||
nt|mamos: I think so if you dont bidding may be even higher before your next turn|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... mean what South meant|pg||
nt|jbgood: a grand even|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: 15 + 14|pg||
nt|danilo1: South knows pd has @S (EW did not bid them)|pg||
mb|d|nt|eamongall: I guess it would be unusual for a 2@S 4@S auction to tackle 5@Hs for penos unless the 4@S chap is strong balanced |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yea but he wont like that xx in d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But here for sure = 6 NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|mamos: oooohh are they on the same page??|pg||
nt|danilo1: opps .. South may now read @C as cue!!!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last hand S could not have @CAQ with the 15-17 nt East Hans|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eamongall: NS hands show the power of a couple of singletons ... especially the xxx opposite x in @Hs |pg||
nt|jbgood: and he will not know that prd has a @d ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: 6h|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that dtage knowing who had @SKQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 7 needs 3-3 inboth minors or 3-3 @Cs and he @D J to fall in 2 - not good odds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What did I start with? 7 NT - but that was a joke... Easy to play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 33-9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is - I hate to admit it - winning line. Bad defense = 3 IMPÂ´s, bad bidding now = 11 IMPÂ´s|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 2@S|pg||
nt|fokal: in 2 @s they lose at least 1 @s 2 @c 2 @d and 1 (or 2) @h|pg||
nt|fokal: so it should be a push|pg||
nt|fokal: If N had redoubled , S might have X 2 @s with 3 Aces and 3 trumps|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|mamos: quick hand?|pg||
nt|grebrof: not so quick in the start|pg||
nt|mamos: will be good for EW because inevitably some pairs will not find NT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yke:  I don;t like the 3NT call|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i think 3nt is a dreadful bid|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably -1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yke:  agree|pg||
nt|snorre: practical bid: 13-15, no major|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sunsamvar: Great work by our operator Kacper from the venue|pg||

pc|h7|pc|d2|nt|grebrof: good auction too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: Great working with u Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very logical - and good - from East, The @H Queen proves, that Wests @H need no help|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South should have covered the @S Queen - West i the dangerous hand|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: XX|pg||
nt|fokal: But I would agree with tom's decision; no aces , no quick tricks, and not so many points after all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|grebrof: discarding IS funny|pg||
nt|fokal: the 4 of @h should deny the K|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hear next board Dutch in 7@H|pg||
nt|fokal: so therefore probably shows the @c king|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@H made|pg||
nt|fokal: oh, can't wait for that one :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is 2@S-1 so tell them operator pls NEXT board:)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: sometimes I really want :)|pg||
nt|fokal: let's try to figure S trouble|pg||
nt|jaapfr: players can not know but we and all specs can see |pg||
nt|fokal: playing @c is bad if declarer has the king|pg||
nt|fokal: playing @h shouldn't be bad anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Jeff|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: sry, priv|pg||
nt|fokal: so even if his partner's cards seem to show the @c king, there is no emergency|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  At the other table West led he @H 10, so East cintinued @H...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphpl9: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess S understands she has to hold @hs at least now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|danilo1: in OR ... North never mentined @C bd. 26 ... so it has been  al ittle difficult for South to find 6@C|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and finally Tx to the organisers, BBO and Roland for bringing this vugraph to us|pg||
