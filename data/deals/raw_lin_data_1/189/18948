nt|vugraphpl2: such a interesting board at the beginning :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, did you arrange that, Maria?|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|kiwi_joker: Thomas Bessis is one of the world's finest young players, without doubt, so hopefully this set will be full of interest.|pg||
nt|athene: well, 5@H is down in theory (diamond lead to ace, spade underlead to queen, diamond ruff) but in practice i guess it would be making|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: yes, of course :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|stoffers:  5@h makes yes, its a matter of finding the @c play here to get out for-100|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it's obvious to bid 5@H with the west hand so this might well be a big pick-up for Apteker|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||

nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|alok_daga: playing IMPS wud prefer 2 bid 7dmnds|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1nt (tr 2 dmnds),acceptance,RKC,5NT 7|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all wellcome to the first KO-match|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 4@H looks ok for e/w   but can beaten if defence finds 2 diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D  makes if getting heart right|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 4@s or 5@c playable|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  do well in spades in spite of 4-1 split|pg||
nt|ady: sorry of course 3 losers in diamonds for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If 2 @D is a weak-2 - itÂ´s awful|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 5@H here would be a great sucess for E-W unless  N-s finds an impossible @D ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: E: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=7668|pg||
nt|pelu: to make 4@S decl has to duck @s 2x, but as u see 5@H close to make - only defense: @DA and small @S to Q - almost impossible to find|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: W: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3480|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Raju wellcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: GM peter Thx and welcome all the specs|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|alok_daga: 3spades=shortage,I assume|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@D seems to have stolen the hand|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I would not open 2H with 4 cards in the other major in 2nd hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And so much values in minors|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 4cl by East,now all Forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: the X is the clue to S to find the winning plan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: good board for australia if they make this it will be ahugh bonus not very tuff|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @C ace is off hence let it be doubleon then|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sorry very sorry|pg||
nt|suketbombi: South Africa was dreaming:):)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: 420 is par, use entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to finess in @s immediately|pg||
nt|ady: not the way to beat 4@H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jr7: Hi all - no names, but we are playing|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the trump lead doesnt hurt declarer much|pg||
nt|alok_daga: hope bidding 6 does not go unpunished as a flat brd|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Fantoni,Nunes miss this cold grand?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: are these the right teams/names?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ace of @H and a @h will be a deception for North|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rmb1: North needed to make more of his club suit in the auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|davpro: Well done|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|alok_daga: this 7 ,playing teams by any standard shud br a push.F&N will be v upset I am sure|pg||
nt|davpro: true|pg||
nt|suketbombi: too fast|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S x in OR hare S only open 1@S and EW could easy fins the @H-fit and bid on to 5@h|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: there is more though, some chance of a squeeze for 5|pg||

nt|athene: which suggests people should open 4 of a major more often|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Everything natural for EW, Steve?|pg||
nt|stoffers:  This may be interresting. Double now and 3@c later?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|stoffers:  Seems like it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: y|pg||
nt|stoffers:  Not after 2@c behind tough :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW play natural after 1@D, but when they open 1@C, they play transfer responses|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: the 2@C bid may slow down Thomas' enthusiasm for his hand here  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: when I was arriving today to the international fair (here the european bridge championship is played) it was very sunny and heat :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kiwi_joker: Can N-S find their spade contract?|pg||

nt|athene: the problem now is that south might not be 100% sure his partner has spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: "double - then - 3@C" might just be a way of showing a monster club overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so there isn't the same distributional promise|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: after all that potential, ends in a quiet little 3@C|pg||
nt|stoffers:  Small diamond best now|pg||
nt|stoffers:  And bach should follow and old rule: When having trumplength lead your long suit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: well, the defence still have time to get a force going|pg||
nt|athene: since east has both black kings for entries|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: not sure why the heart ..making pd ruff .... delmonte knew he was eventually coming to a heart trick, with that entryless dummy|pg||
nt|athene: well, the fourth round of spades might be an entry for a heart up|pg||
nt|athene: but only if declarer can draw trumps and stuff|pg||

nt|hawe45:  How to bid 3 NT - I see no way to that contract|pg||
nt|cenglund:  There is a risk to end up in 4 hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They probably open 1H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It would have more idea to open THIS West-hand with 2 @D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  It was a disaster for the South Africans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but I wouldÂ´nt do it|pg||
nt|pelu: I 100% agree with Apteker to open 4@s|pg||
nt|suketbombi: would have played @S T to queen in an unlikely event @S 9 drops singleton and @DK is doubleton then think about @CS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Patrick|pg||
nt|patricck: Hi everyone :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|pelu: another wild board|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: 4@H  down 2 in open room   11 imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hans , Christer , Specs good afternoon to all |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but - at least in teams - declarer should have played @sA and @s10 before the last trumph. a good player can duck @sJ|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cenglund:  Meck opened 1D with the puny collection of high cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The problem is: You take these two first West-hands and compare. There is TOO much fifference - so partner never will know, what you have, when you open 2 @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@D opener , with diferent type of hands|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1sp 1nt 2hrts,2spades then?|pg||
nt|patricck: A nice start for the Apteker team as EW pushed the Open room pair one level higher|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: double by north|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kirp:  As predicted!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Hi all|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S play either straight forward 2/1 or transfer after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: N opened 3 @c and E made a nonleaping Michaels 4@d, so 4@h was wrongsided and got a @d lead|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT by South is not bad with spade lead from King|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes @H + @D behave well|pg||
nt|rmb1: Meanwhile South could X or bid NT now|pg||
nt|ady: not wild about 2@S from east|pg||
nt|jbgood: 500 in 2@s x - but that will not happen|pg||
nt|mamos: don't know geoffrey|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only + = both hands had the 10 of @S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 11 fast reicks for N-S  in minor |pg||
nt|cenglund:  True, but I am sure they would have opened 1H, but Meck did not allow that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that a @S-shift will kill 5 @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so fast... - these 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the 11 trick of @D can be a problem in this hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|kirp:  S takes ull by the horns|pg||
nt|kirp:  bull not ull|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Nice bid by South!|pg||
nt|pelu: when the X show the black suits what is 2@C then?|pg||
nt|patricck: East has taken away North's main suit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: ah they change|pg||
nt|suketbombi: wnats to get his @S in to picture early and bid @Cs to hilt but his party is spoiled by the 2@C bid East|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and now 3 NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi mike|pg||
nt|mamos: Mahaffey EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least this will be fast:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead is obligatory, otherwise 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C just tell: be carefull N - bad distribution - |pg||
nt|pelu: N dont belive :)|pg||
nt|patricck: Now there is partnership confidence, having no doubts about partner misinterpreting the bid|pg||
nt|pelu: will S bid 3@S or give up?|pg||
nt|patricck: South is sitting there waiting for a power cut I think.....bet he doesn't feel happy about the auction|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: you might have seen me playing with Olsen on BBO, his nick is James950|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's actually a regular on BBO |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nowhere else to go?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5@c also good|pg||
nt|pelu: would u in S place :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: now N sh accept - his partner passed over 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is club ace realistic lead|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S North?|pg||
nt|patricck: best defence is to lead @D, A@H and another might lead to a lucky 10 tricks when the K@S falls after East has ruffed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @DS is the best Start for defence |pg||
nt|pelu: samme bidding to 3@C in OR, but here S passed|pg||
nt|pelu: Piekarek like to X|pg||
nt|patricck: no reason to double here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No @S-lead also OK naturally|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jameslee 2: K@S lead |pg||
pc|s3|nt|rmb1: 4@H will be more interesting|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 4@h:) at least on a spade lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice lead :) |pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: or duck of heart lead now|pg||
nt|pelu: best attack - now prob down more that 1|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a clear duck! If declarer has @hAjxxx why not finess?|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the OR made a helptry thru a 3dmnds,here more logical,end result,same.Diff 2 bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: i think it is, this play only makes sense if south has heart ace|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jameslee 2: bad luck to see 11 and not make them |pg||
pc|h2|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|patricck: best not to cover|pg||
nt|suketbombi: normaly u lead doubleton to get ruff here it is to shorten the big hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: perhaps N might have tried 3@s over 3 @h?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: yes jack was a mistake|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad luck for declarer|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: thats it |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he is the one that can see them not the others |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now -2 for 3 IMPÂ´s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - if he tries to make it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  This would be wrong with 3 @C together with 4 @D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade 10 prevent declarer from squeezing East|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other room 5@C -1|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 x 16 in the finals on Wednesday|pg||
nt|patricck: pitch a @C from dummy might be best|pg||
nt|patricck: 28 board matches are of course cutthroat, the best team often wins but the match is short enough to give the underdog a fighting chance|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he is likely to ruff  and play the @CT|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff, take @SA and play @C and West is ensplayed|pg||
nt|pelu: bridge is so easy when u see all 52 cards :)|pg||
nt|patricck: We've been seeing the same cards for quite a while now.........   hopefully we will see some action soon|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: what are the best chances? enter dummy on @sA and play a small @h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: small heart from hand trick 2 looks fine|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cenglund:  Mahaffey may discard a spade and then declarer will prevail|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|alok_daga: clubs,33,hrts 33,Spade K inside ,nv brd not wrth the risk|pg||
pc|h6|nt|suketbombi: sure but he knows 2/1/5/5 with east|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|nt|cenglund:  Now it's -1|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: upps |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rmb1: @C finesse and @H finesse|pg||
nt|ady: re hi all   got disconnected|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not missed much - declarer edging his way towards his contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West has a weak-2 - and East will keep the @HÂ´s|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: see they chose the 4-3 heart fit     looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|rmb1: More effective auction in OR|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up the hearts   but clubs blocked  so will hav e to lose 1 more|pg||
nt|jbgood: 11 for at push|pg||
nt|patricck: A@S and Q@S is good enough to make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jameslee 2: 5@C =|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|pelu: now its East who is endplayed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes |pg||
nt|patricck: well, a small diamond lead declarer needs to finesse the 9, tricky|pg||
pc|d3|nt|suketbombi: he has all the count tho|pg||
nt|pelu: no he know after the bidding that East has all @Ds|pg||
nt|patricck: not so tricky on the bidding|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|kiwi_joker: It's "have suitcase, will travel" for the bridge pro's these days. 24 hours before the Open teams started here in Poznan, Delmonte and Bach were playing at the Asia Pacific ...|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: another interesting board :)|pg||
nt|athene: when you double 2 of a major with Axxx trumps and very small spot cards, it's nice to have a shortage so you can get some ruffs|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: given what a disaster it is to concede 2major doubled, i am surprised how often it happens at high levels of competition|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: certainly there are some top players who are *extremely* wary about these doubles|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Running scores not running yet, hopefully soon|pg||
nt|athene: for example in the vanderbilt a while back i saw helgemo pulling a t/o double of 2@H with five hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the italians similarly|pg||

nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he can get it right on the following logic:|pg||
nt|athene: south passed over 1@S with 5 diamonds and 4 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so he has to have a really grotty hand|pg||
nt|athene: or you would think he would have just made his rebid|pg||

nt|stoffers:  p u h says the french |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: :)|pg||
nt|stoffers:  damn, im so slow :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: was looking a lot like +670 for EW for a while there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, they did not get the H ruff yet|pg||
mc|7|nt|Walddk2: They did|pg||
nt|athene: also, would north really double 1nt and 2@S with only @DAK @SQxxx|pg||

nt|roswolf: meckwell in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bridge is an easy game - defense not!|pg||
nt|cenglund:  He will establish a spade trick now|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big swing 12 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: miss fit for N-S reds againts -blacks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: part score lets see where|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cenglund:  You could not imagine that he scored a trick in a side suit missing KQJ10|pg||
nt|pelu: a very nice board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  Precision @C by W|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S can make 3@h and E/W can make 3@d, but need accurate play to make 3@H I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed mike -straightforward bd|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fann4: The OR (Open Room) in 4@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kirp:  3@H looks ambitious on 43|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@d was suction|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @H or @s and @c|pg||
nt|rmb1: According to their card, South could open 1NT,  not sure why he didn't|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|oosmanb: 3@D probably for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@h might be tricky|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 17 facing 14,a slam for the taking as cards fit.Doubt whether it will be bid|pg||
nt|fann4: E made a try and then stopped (he was facing a weak NT opening)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this 2@D is a new species, at least for me|pg||
nt|kirp:  curious to see how high EW get now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nobody will agree - but life is fantastic. if you open he North hand with 1 @C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fann4: Similar situation now - not easy for E to drive to slam, though he has 7 controls, a doubleton and some good @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 2@s on the way to 3@d?|pg||
nt|ady: bad diamond split may beat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt!?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other table meck made the 2@H with the sing 8@C lead |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: but here bidding to finishe |pg||
nt|cenglund:  Multi is a dangerous gadget - for both sides|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S: I confirm my 5-card-suit...|pg||
nt|pelu: a veru poor opening, can NS stop in time?|pg||
nt|patricck: might be a thin opening, but it would have been a chunky pass :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: agree peter|pg||
nt|pelu: Qx 2x are not good vcalues|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kirp:  E showed 5-7 hcp, so no strain on raise to 3@D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this just needs @C Ace onside, (or Ax @S?)|pg||
nt|alok_daga: wud rank F&N as 1 of the best in business they not having a gud day in office|pg||
nt|pelu: and the opening suit not better|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rmb1: Loose one @D and ruff one, could be just one @D loser|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may lose to the king and ruff one - that would give 10|pg||
nt|ady: yes    will have to take care|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks certain|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume the 1@S bid denied 4@H|pg||
nt|fann4: Only 11 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the nt game playing IMPS is ridiculous|pg||
nt|patricck: sure, but the 10@D is a useful filler, I am not saying it is a clear opening, just that it is close to the borderline|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: sry Robin - not a deliberate copy:)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rmb1: Yes.  Not always true that 3 losers is 10 winners|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jameslee 2: now hw has confirm the 5@C also :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - at the 3-level...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos:  So Diamonds are 3-3 and soon declarer wil smile|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that the odds are on north only having 3|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: will find the A of @c and @s after 1@d, since 1@h was a freely bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: this looks very good for NS, all games down and lots of values|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks on any lead, so a nice stop|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer does have entry problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i fancy this making|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jameslee 2: not and easy spot to make 9 lets she what can happend |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|pelu: no problem in opening on 11, but u sh have a good suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oosmanb: actually maybe it also needs A@S onside or @D 2-2, so you can get to 2nd @c trick|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: looks to bwe going about it the right way|pg||
nt|mamos: or communication problems is a better way of expressing it|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9@C coming back |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: agree also the number of Cards in Major are relevant when u open light|pg||
nt|patricck: I would agree it would be a horrible opening if the @D were J7532, but with J10852 I would not condemn my partner if they chose to open|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jameslee 2: j@D can come from N |pg||
nt|pelu: 7 tricks: @DAK, @c to Q and @Dj|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mamos: yeah we know it's ok  he does not|pg||
nt|roswolf: now declarer just needs to cash tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: The home team's true name now is KONSTANTA. We had input the name SKWARK due to some minor discrepancies in the matchup. We apologize for any inconvenience.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: in Op S passed over 1@S, and now EW in 2@Sx|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|jameslee 2: can make 2@H/2@D/4@C not easy to make the 9th trick |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rmb1: Made it look easy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|mamos: hmm  it is difficult for declarer to be confident that he has the tricks he needs|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Meckwell had a disaster in the OR|pg||
nt|fann4: Alok, I think your criticism is a bit strong - East knows they have 29-31 points between, so how risky is 3NT? I'd say virtually not at all.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  Easy defense against 6 @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: can make 3NT as the cards lay|pg||
nt|oosmanb: no stopping now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if guessing right in @h's|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@H   but fortunate |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|rmb1: Can make 4@H if there is only 1 @H loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hardly recommended but brown would have done well to balance with double|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: will hav e to drop honor doubleton heart in north hand   and bring in 5 club tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: X from East?  4@C seems too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: @S partial|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean: 6 @S|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the fact that the spade suit does not cum into the frame,I found objectionable|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  14-16 hcp, 3@C is simple Stayman|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Yes, because there is not way of pitching the losing diamonds|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@C = singleton @C not in the goos spot for N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @H...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Meck hates to bid bad slams, but he did not follow his principle on this one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very dificult not to bid 6@H here |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cue-bids might be invented these days|pg||
nt|cenglund:  RKCB is not the answer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but on info controls could be a good stop from N-S lets see |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South has bad values in the side-suits|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he could bid it directly or not |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: long think |pg||
nt|cenglund:  I suppose 3C shows minimum|pg||
nt|fann4: Slam is on here for NS, but the @SKQx opposite shortage looks wasted to South.|pg||
nt|fann4: This can go for 800 in 4@Sx|pg||
nt|fann4: Note E did not enter the auction in the OR|pg||
nt|alok_daga: but AQ10xx,shud appeal when partner splinters|pg||
nt|fann4: NS are clearly in a forcing situation, so S may pass.|pg||
nt|fann4: In which case N will likely press on.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Pass?his strength yet undisclosed|pg||
nt|fann4: S hates @SKQx for offense, but dbl may be a little premature|pg||
nt|fann4: Alok, 3@S is a splinter, forcing to game.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1hrt may be 6,he has 14|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Hi|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi and welcome Pekka|pg||
nt|patricck: should be a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Dbl =?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: flat board here 1@H & 2@CS to loose|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This was the solution - now 4 @H and thatÂ´s it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Now he cant cue bid 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If he does, he might make the slam...!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: let,s see if S can help N to bid the good contract |pg||
nt|pelu: the runnings scores are yet not running, but I am sure that the polish IT-staff is working hard|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|jbgood: stole it|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club switch now|pg||
nt|mamos: South squeezed out of auction|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Provided that 4C was not a query of some kind|pg||
nt|bagman: If memory servers; greco hampson play meckwell type precision where North was limited|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. Either a @d lead or continue with @s|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @c lead ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not easy to pick that contract|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N is fairly lucky to make, 3@C could be 5 CMS looking at 3@S bid to show 4@Hs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can he play on @C instead of @H ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  W showed @S if any 4 crd major, so @S lead is not best usually|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cenglund:  They are heading for same destination|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there they go to 6@H|pg||
nt|pelu: there could come 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kirp:  may play on @Hs |pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hate to - but have to! - syt it: POOR BIDDING AT BOTH TABLES|pg||
nt|hawe45:  say it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I don't think that this slam is unavoidable|pg||
nt|pelu: no more|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: i want to bid|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: this is what happened!|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kirp:  small @H best now, but @D finesse works|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: considering his middelcards in @c, playing one round on @h's was more attempting, needed to try @c's if first @h failed?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Team Angelini picked up more imps in board 2 when the other room bid 3NT instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|kirp:  ad hope NY couldn't take 3@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: a fair punt, but didnt work out|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes, I guess J@H onside is higher %age than @C 3-3? |pg||
nt|kirp:  3@S lead certainly gave defense little chance to figure out what to do|pg||
nt|kirp:  if @H J is onside, then has time to test @Cs and if not 33, then @Ds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D finesse|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt he need @d finesse in any case? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  They are "buried" in their conventions!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|fann4: Yes, I think they play a lot of Meckwell stuff.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Both N-S pairs thought that it's a big minus|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|jbgood: needed to safety play diamonds to win|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: likely not much difference here since NS on for 4@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  still only 8 trix with J@H onside|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to get 3@d tricks, so @d finesse is very much needed|pg||
nt|kirp:  S should have continued @Hs ,then needed @D finesse|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jameslee 2: we,ll after all (no score)  we shall keep 12-12|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: now has to drop doubleton A@S eith east    play towards K@S    then drop ace 2nd round|pg||
nt|jbgood: still 1 down may be cheap|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kirp:  another pickup for EW, as they played 1N in OR|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: information www.poznan2011.pl |pg||

nt|hawe45:  11 tricks possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4nt?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam 6@d or 6@c|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so 1@h from South now, showing 4+@s|pg||
nt|patricck: NS make 10 tricks in @H and EW can make 9 tricks as a sacrifice in @D |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Convention card I have says 2H natural|pg||
nt|jbgood: a direct 3 NT or via 3@h?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not bridge:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont like double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@s from north show 3-5 @s's they open 1@c with weak hands with 5-5 in @c and @s|pg||
nt|patricck: or 8 tricks sacrificing in spades, same score|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: transfers first|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kirp:  2@S can buy the hand now|pg||

pc|c3|nt|fann4: 1 off on the bad trump break.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: where does the 8th trick cum from?5hrts+2 dmnds|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to play the @DJ from dummy after winning @HK hoping to be able to get a spade or a diamond later|pg||
nt|fann4: There is no 8th trick - he will lose 3@C tricks.|pg||
nt|fann4: Now that he is going to be deprived of a @C ruff he should probably win in hand and play a @S up to the K|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W is very happy now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@s confirm the 5th @s|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jameslee 2: diferent bid other table 3@S here 2nt to end in 3nt |pg||

nt|suketbombi: chaance to make now|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, a @C ruff was possible|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jameslee 2: x@H lead could come from S |pg||
nt|alok_daga: played xledummy it will make|pg||
nt|fann4: You are wrong. It cannot make.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he can finese the @Ds and make|pg||
nt|pelu: same start in Or also here East ducked @h10 - and then @H to A and @D finess|pg||
pc|h9|nt|patricck: In the other room East ducked a trump to get a signal, but when West showed out on the 2nd heart declarer finessed the diamond|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jameslee 2: not much comunication for the 2 @S finesse required |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C play could duck by S |pg||
nt|bagman: East needs to play a spade in some point to prevent @S-@D strip squeeze; if the defense cashes their 4 tricks and fail to play a spade, W is strip squeezed|pg||
nt|fann4: And easy to see - losing 1 trump, 1@S, 3@C and @DK|pg||

nt|athene: i am trying to think of a layout where it would be necessary for south to attack diamonds now - probably there isn't one|pg||
nt|athene: for example suppose declarer had @DAxx and @SKQJx|pg||
nt|athene: and he was threatening to get diamonds away on spades|pg||
nt|athene: then he would have only two clubs so he could throw a diamond from hand on the @CK anyway|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: that was assuming the club lengths are still ambiguous even after the lead|pg||

nt|athene: this is interesting - is this going to be a sort of vice squeeze on south now?|pg||
nt|athene: no, it doesn't work|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: 5 boards to go... 8 IMP different...|pg||
nt|athene: because if you cash the @H5 and @CK you give north a club winner to take after his @DA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s4|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 10 |pg||
nt|bagman: West should have discard the @SA because the !Q was not covered so E had the @SJ left|pg||
nt|bagman: @SQ|pg||
nt|alok_daga: a likely push,|pg||
nt|patricck: It couldn't be @D, you can see those in dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: 12 IMP after mistake in defense and then in play|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Suppose West opens 1 @H - would 5 @D be the bid?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The level of bridge seen so far has been rather poor and not what we had expected|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: has 4@H could wait |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so 3 teams go to the A Swiss and the others to B. Then 27 from A and 5 from B go to the KO rounds|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: no carry overs|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H  about the limit for n/s|pg||
nt|rmb1: Might try 4@S would make if @SKx onside|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oosmanb: Fun hand now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At the other table only 3 @D - too friendly|pg||
nt|fann4: They could miss it now|pg||
nt|fann4: But vul N must be tempted to do something.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kirp:  3@H by NS should be the limit, not successfully either|pg||

nt|alok_daga: now the excitement starts with a unnatural 2hrts|pg||
nt|fann4: Shows you!|pg||
nt|fann4: 2@H wasn't unnatural - it was a weak 2.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Well North's initial pass|pg||
nt|oosmanb: has put an upper limit I think|pg||
nt|kirp:  gives W a problem, tho' strong@C system helps|pg||
nt|kirp:  W knows NS have 8+@Hs ,|pg||
nt|fann4: Maybe not everyone's choice, with A109xxx.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the @H duck was strang apparently happened on other tables too|pg||
nt|pelu: but again easy for us|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: yes    the hand belongs to e/w    but 9 tricks the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 8@hs I would say, x from east should show 4@h?|pg||
nt|kirp:  2N is some form of Lebensohl, compete in a minor|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yes seems like it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kirp:  but not as clear in this sequence|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult call here|pg||
nt|mamos: East's hand seems enormous for this treatment but what do I know|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: lead critical|pg||
nt|ady: n/s well overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: no diamond lead makes south huge favorite to hold spade queen|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@S on the K@C placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  good stop|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: indeed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a passive defence here is in order  @D being frozen suit|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 4 losers|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rmb1: Its only -1 |pg||
nt|roswolf: and a club switch to follow|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: spec gives me a 6@D cool contract comment |pg||
nt|bagman: In the 2nd position the preempt should be quite pure as there's sort of 50-50 chance that the good cards are held by the partner|pg||
pc|s3|nt|suketbombi: yes unless defence opens up @DS|pg||
nt|pelu: down 1 as long as NS dont play @D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: 200 to Netherlands    could only make 140     east with defensive values  might have doubled 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And with 400 in 5 @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - East ducks the first @C for sure|pg||
nt|fann4: So 10 imps probably to DEN|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true only 1 discard for the 4th @H not enough for 12 @D|pg||
nt|fann4: Who will have built up a good lead.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Marty Bergen says AQJ10xx&Jxxx of the OM 2 start a weak 2 here the suit also bad |pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos: maybe a little lucky that there was a Spade to cash|pg||
nt|roswolf: these top players dont go wrong in the play of these hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: a great result for mahaffey|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: -1 now. 2@d 2@h and one trumph|pg||
nt|ady: may only be down 1    need to take club ruff|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A heart continuation would been fatal|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|cenglund:  3 IMPs to Apteker|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  two rds of @C now and @H A and back:)|pg||

nt|mamos: wild hand |pg||
nt|mamos: s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another IMP possible here for Apteker|pg||
nt|fann4: These days most experts prefer to open a weak 2 with a side 4 card major, if it's not too good a suit.|pg||
nt|pelu: what a gift|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes true + this defence if both wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: so 76% :) I will only give 1% for misdefense|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Again EW might try 4@S|pg||
nt|fann4: But I far preferred the pass made at the other table.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Any endplays possible for 10th trick in 4@H? |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: I doubt it, so NS would do well to stop below game|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C was 16+ artificial|pg||
nt|fann4: Wow - a disaster for EW in the CR, ending up in 4@H in a 5-1 fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 61% for NS on board 6, nobody made 3@C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but with a 10 card fit, vulnerable, can Fjaelberg put the brakes on |pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H can make if W does not switch to @S when in with the A@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oosmanb: How? even if @C are stripped East has 4th @d to exit?|pg||
nt|kirp:  8@S|pg||
nt|patricck: more than 1% chance for a misdefence because it could be the opening lead that gives it away. After that has been survived very unlikely the defence will slip,|pg||
pc|h3|nt|oosmanb: Ah right, |pg||
nt|jbgood: guess X shows 4-5+ spades?|pg||
nt|ady: down 1  would sedem unless a slip|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1C-P-1H = S so I guess this X is a transfer to S as well|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 4@h now|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A less interesting board |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Overtrick is easy: 2 x @H - and a SMALL @D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|oosmanb: Well spotted Martin|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: might get to 4 now|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Fantoni,Nunes reach a 4hrts on a 5 1 suit,miss their 5 3 fit,a off day for them|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: S could never hope to buy the contract in @hs - so perhaps xx in stead of 2 @h to indicate a high @h honor might have worked better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  That's what happened in the OR|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oosmanb: So yes important for West to break up endplay, and he will too, has 1@S bid to help him|pg||
nt|kirp:  I said 'can make', timing and defense needed to help|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bagman: E knows that W has short hearts and might even hope a heart lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|alok_daga: Assume pp 1sp p 2nt=4trumps+a stiff.AKx treated as a 4card in the OR|pg||
nt|fann4: In my book, the W hand is just a 2@S raise over 1@S|pg||
nt|bagman: Here declarer can cash the @HA and cross ruff 8 additional trump tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fann4: Can one make 10 tricks on the layout?|pg||
nt|bagman: GIB can but E's going to cash his easy 9 :)|pg||

nt|fann4: No, I think it's more than 19|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes checking now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbgood: but self inflicted and well deserved|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: S probably showed AK bare by leading the @HK; on the @HK, N should signal as to normal Kx lead; when the @HA reveals the position, N should show suit preference how to get in|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT play wrong way up|pg||
nt|jbgood: a good example why 3NT should be played by W|pg||

nt|fann4: I'm not at all convinced about passing the S hand.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 2spades with hrt,5 3 enterprising|pg||
nt|bagman: If 3@H showed a minimum, E has nothing to add|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: yeah|pg||
nt|kirp:  even after a @H switch by S, one duck and S has no more entries|pg||
nt|oosmanb: too many stoppers in @s, no entry for @H, |pg||
nt|kirp:  however there are transport problems|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4 more IMPs to Angelini|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3rd seat 1@H seems like it might disrupt things a bit|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: was almost expecting Olsen to open 2@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I was half expecting a 1@H opening|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not sure if he and Jan open 2@H on 5 card suites|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|patricck: not a lucky contract, but I agree with Souths bidding|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jr7: I think they are trying to catch the play they are playing now!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I know many players, who would - as happened at the other table - have bid 2 @H over Wests 1 @S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jameslee 2: last board could be a big swing to make the match closer |pg||
nt|fann4: This can easily go 2  down.|pg||
nt|bagman: EW are vulnerable, but I think that this is punishing partner for balancing|pg||
nt|fann4: E did far too much here.|pg||
nt|fann4: And suddenly ANG could pick up 8 or so imps|pg||
nt|alok_daga: &not a bad balance at that.1sp pp 2hrts can be worse|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|fabsayc: malinowsku operating again with 3NT bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this time succesfully|pg||
nt|jbgood: an early unblock by N|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|kirp:  now  some problems for W|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: entry problem in East|pg||

nt|oosmanb: small @D or AK/?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: maybe some back for Aptekar|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kirp:  small @D towards J, now W has to hope Q@C dblton|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think there were problems with small @D to J too, then you dont have tempo for @C tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: as south will play another @S, before any @C played|pg||
nt|oosmanb: tricky hand to play|pg||
nt|bagman: N might cash out|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|nt|bagman: He knows that W must hold at least one spade|pg||
nt|fann4: There a number of ways to set this 2 tricks, but N has to be careful.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3nt on board 20 can be made to make it a big swing |pg||
nt|fann4: And this is not one of them.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h8|nt|suketbombi: @C shift wud have been killer declerar can still prevail on this lay out|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: 4@S also a make e/w|pg||
nt|bagman: Before setting it 2 tricks you have to set it 1 trick first|pg||
nt|fann4: Agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: And if you have the setting trick in hand in a nondoubled vulnerable game, you quite often should cash it|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer needs to take a ruffing finesse in @C to get 8 tricks|pg||
nt|alok_daga: cash hrt Ace play spade |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|patricck: the defnece needed to switch to @C because there is no entry to the @S either|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|alok_daga: Last brd of the set.Thnks 2 fellow commentators,specs&Monica for the gr8 vugraph|pg||

nt|alok_daga: GN all|pg||
nt|bagman: the trump lead was quite standard after the auction; with hearts 3-3 the spades go away for push|pg||

nt|athene: interesting play from Bach there|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: The knock-out stages are 28 boards|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he was worried north might win the @DQ and set up hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then he (declarer) would only have eight tricks - 5 spades, 1 heart, 2 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence might win the @DA and cash enough hearts to beat the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: S asks W about the meaning of auction...|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: and he's still thinking :)|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't look very plausible though - just playing south for the @DQ looked a simpler way to make tricks|pg||
