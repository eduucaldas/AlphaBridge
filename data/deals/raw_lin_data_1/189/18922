nt|bernix: good morning and welcome everybody to round 3 of semifinal A of the European Open|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru:  finally we got to a std 3NT|pg||
nt|pelu: all card well placed = 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: also 3Nt in OR|pg||
pc|sA|nt|granguru:  funnily if  opens the hand (1N) there is a good chance to arrive at 6@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  could be worth a couple of imps if it is played by West in the other room|pg||
nt|chmitty: I must say that I never met the pair sitting EW ... not been introduced to Mister West nor Mister East|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|peachy: This will slide a couple off, but small gain for EW anyway, undoubled|pg||

nt|granguru:  another potential slam here|pg||
nt|granguru:  a better one thou|pg||
nt|pelu: only need to play @s-siut with no loser|pg||
nt|granguru:  still it  needs @s 2-2 or stiff honor in E and a good guess|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|pelu: Hi all - as every time there are problems before the first match - players has to find the right table and so on|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3NT or 5@c both cold here|pg||
nt|chmitty: not an easy bid for North|pg||
nt|chmitty: Can our operator disclose the names of the players sitting EW ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: oh yes :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: ty|pg||
nt|peachy: He might go for the practical 3NT if this were MPs, not so sure IMPs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: not with odds - but better that a "Roland-slam"|pg||
nt|bernix: part score battle again. can NS buy it in 3@h ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all, gutten morgen Bernard|pg||
nt|bernix: hi danilo|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Pleased to see that South has a name, but I think I'll stick with 'South'|pg||
nt|granguru:  exchange black QÂ´s and it would have been a rock iron contract|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: we begin with a possible slam|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: Rodwell did open the N hand with 1NT???|pg||
nt|chmitty: Difficult for South to imagine he has so many defensive tricks !|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will North x now ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hope for him there was not too much of an hesitation behind the screen|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S might have doubled. Vul versus notvul, N had great expectations of making, the colors tell he was not preempting|pg||
nt|chmitty: I agree 100% Raija|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: Hi John|pg||
mb|4S|nt|granguru:  I would have done it if @CK|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think many in the field will bid this one|pg||
nt|chmitty: he must protect the score of his pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  NICE TO see u again Raija |pg||
nt|granguru:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Convention cards are not available so unfprtunately we cannot explain bidding|pg||
nt|granguru:  at NT or any Moysean|pg||
nt|chmitty: Next door bidding started 2@s (E) 4@s ... NOrth thinking|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|pelu: and I would open 1@D 100% (=4+@d)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North has distribution and they have a lot of controls|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@C cue X @Cs|pg||
nt|granguru:  N could have xx to show second round ctrl|pg||
nt|pelu: when N open 1Nt then Meckstroth has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|pelu: RD = 1. round control|pg||
nt|granguru:  but then it is more complicate to show @d ctrls|pg||
nt|granguru:  RD is second if 4@C was first|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: @H-lead - 2x@s and @C finess|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: ok that makes life easyer for dsecl|pg||
pc|d7|nt|granguru:  If I would be forced to guess  1@C strong 1@S=4 ctrls 2N nat 19-21 3@D @C ctrl no @D ctrl|pg||
nt|bernix: phantom sac|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  It is much easier for us, but can South have less than this to make a slam try with no heart control?|pg||
nt|danilo1: ideal def. is - first @H for A, than @DK and third @D ... guess not easy for Adam now ... since North cann well be single @D |pg||
nt|bernix: but it doesn't matter if he cashes a 2nd @d before switching to hearts|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|peachy: lots of work in 6NT, not impossible I think, but rather aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  a passive lead is a must here|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm thinking E will lead club, that would be my choice|pg||
nt|granguru:  it seems 3@d was nat as N went on to 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: but I am not in Hurd's class of player so we'll see|pg||
nt|granguru:  most passive is @D|pg||
nt|granguru:  the @D10 is a critical card (not here thou) so W has 4 critical suits|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|granguru:  N S expects that @S dont behave...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: do u know players where cuebid are 1. control - to day 1. or 2.? back in the 50'es in US they only cuebid Aces - and lost to Italy every time :)|pg||
nt|peachy: that would have been my last choice of leads, Jxx nearly never right|pg||
nt|granguru:  I am wrong E leads|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru:  E has a clear @d lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: Versace will not escape 800 |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|danilo1: excellent defense ... now even -2 possible |pg||
nt|bernix: caiti must use his only entry to dummy to finesse in @cs rather than @ss|pg||
nt|danilo1: did not matter for -1, I agree Bernard|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Operator, West is  Caiti|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps there is something in the bidding that we are not privvy to, which induced the spade lead|pg||
nt|peachy: To watch multiple tables, http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php.  Open a new window for each additional table.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru:  :) true|pg||
nt|granguru:  second choice was @CJ|pg||
nt|granguru:  immo|pg||
pc|h5|nt|granguru:  MADE|pg||

nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it is a good idea that the very first control is A (or KQ)|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|granguru:  not vul sorry only 22!|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, by the end of tha match, maybe I learn some French by osmosis :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and me some English|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: 2@d both majors ?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chmitty: seems so|pg||
nt|peachy: Long time ago, we used to call those bids Polish two suiters, nowadays there are several variations and names for them|pg||
nt|peachy: Hungarian kib tells it is 5@h-4@s, or 4414 or 4405, 11-15HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  would like to hear your arguments...I am open minded :)|pg||
nt|bernix: this looks like a run-of-the-mill 4@s to me|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chmitty: So Lauria will probably reject the option of double ... which could be effective in front of a @s lenght|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  kibz might enjoy an expert view on the matter|pg||
nt|paulg:  I don't think cue bidding first and second round controls equally makes a huge difference to bidding slams, a lot of it still comes down to judgement|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  i think the italians beat the americans so often because they had practised partnerships and better bidding methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  being an  expensive deparment players try to reduce judgement and increase accuracy|pg||
nt|granguru:  good advice...on all contracts under 6NT|pg||
nt|peachy: There are no convention cards available for us (or anyone) so appreciate kib help in interpreting bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: 3@c sounds like maximum with 5-card suit doesnt it|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk NS play 1NT 15-17 (or at least did before) ... 1@C is choice I believe (agree, 6 controls, no soft values, hand better for suit contracts)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|granguru:  agree paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand has another debatable point .. how do you break transfers?|pg||
nt|pelu: too difficult to start a cue bid if only A, a cue is an invitation for slam and often u will miss that - and bidding economy also tell u to start with the lovers cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Since there were so many small boards in the first half, I was hoping that all the spectacular stuff had been saved for the second half. False hopes...|pg||
nt|granguru:  from 6NT on the strategy changes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 toptricks for defense, but not easy to take them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i dislike showing a weak doubleton and telling them what to lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  at top level players almost always lead the right card|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|granguru:  so it is better to bid accurately|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East has found a strong lead.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: now 7 tricks for Tokay|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3@C dont show about @Cs but only maxz and 3 card support|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i approve of breaking the transfer with only 3-card support, when you are so suitable|pg||
nt|granguru:  once hamman erred a gran slam lead...20 years the hand was appearing in the news|pg||
nt|peachy: running scores Round 3 (this round) http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda3.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  And he used Judgement..with 2 aces he led the shortest one..(wrong)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chmitty: Great decision by Lauria : 5@c would be at least 2 off when 4@h is down|pg||
nt|peachy: I did find a fairly recent card for EW http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: running a long suit usually creates problems for the defence|pg||
nt|peachy: NS basic system is Strong Club|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Now a club ruff will beat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with best defence. a @c switch now|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @h9 ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  looks to ask for @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Failing that, a trump misguess by declarer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in that case possibilities to -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  E isn't willing to ask for a @c switch, not knowing what partner has in @c I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was declarer, after a transfer response to 1@C, at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if there is any possibility to defeat, it must be a @c ruff by E. Declarer can have @sKQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW missed the defense against 4@S - played by S: @H to K, @D to A Now @CK to A, @S to 8 and Q, @CJ to Q - but not @C again|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: now 9|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|pelu: well played by W - he set up a trap - and N fall in|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and looking happily for the 10th|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@S is not good contract ... correct pass by Balicki ... |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|granguru:  looks that there is no way to win...no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  @DK ?|pg||
nt|peachy: There are 15 groups of 8 teams each, the top three (I think) will advance to the Swiss, from where top teams advance to KO etc|pg||
nt|peachy: This isnt quite making, I think|pg||
pc|s4|nt|granguru:  what about small @d ?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: from each group|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: So the chance is missed.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Ralf's analysis is good. It does seem that a club switch was indicated.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|granguru:  at 6NT the reason is not to give the 12th trick ...normally declarer coudnt find a suit to play...so usually no long suit..if 12 tricks there, there is nothing to lose...but if just 11 you must be carefull not to give 1 trick on the lead.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|granguru:  ans @s finesse--not @C|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c5|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe for other reasons than he thought of|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|pelu: strange defense to duck @dJ |pg||
nt|granguru:  made now|pg||
nt|paulg:  no, he's down now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bernix: endplay doesnt work because he lacks the @d8|pg||

nt|rcerreto: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|rcerreto: dangerous board|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N may pass|pg||
nt|rcerreto: might, will he?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: it takes guts to pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: please tell directors to stop tripping over the cables|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rcerreto: 3NT is way better than 4@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N also likely to fail|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto: but undoubled, likely|pg||
mb|d|nt|rcerreto: no|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: at single dummy it does not look clear to me that 3N is better|pg||
nt|rcerreto: asking for a @h lead, maybe|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but...|pg||
nt|rcerreto: it's better because @h are 5-0 :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think it asks for anything special|pg||
nt|marlowepi: both NS thought for a long time, so double has two ways to win|pg||
nt|rcerreto: switching the 8 and 9 of @s, on a @d lead defense would cash 7 tricks at once|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: exactly, that is why i said that 3N isnt better at single dummy|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: the double also helos the defense, because E knows 100% that W has heart king|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec suggested that N might hook W for club nine due to the double. unlikely because that very double marks him with the hearts|pg||
nt|cumino: There was also a problem to play @C after @S and @D in EAST|pg||
pg||
qx|c4|st||md|2S9HAQ92DKQCAKT653,S84HKJT76DAJ85C42,SQ653H8543DT94CQ9,SAKJT72HD7632CJ87|sv|b|nt|paulg:  it was very tricky and I'm not sure he ever saw a line to make it. As I was struggling seeing all the hands, I'm not surprised really.|pg||
nt|granguru:  garozzo had another saying..when you have a singleton, lead it...|pg||
nt|granguru:  obviously at suit contracts|pg||
nt|peachy: It is one of his famous "Rules"|pg||
nt|granguru:  in general, it made life easier for the defense...if you didnt lead a singleton..you didnt have it...|pg||
nt|peachy: Another one of Garozzo's: "Must have a very good reason for not leading trump"|pg||
nt|danilo1: he knows that pd must have very good @S + need @HK + more than just A in @D ... if all this, Adam would not bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rcerreto:  openings are getting lighter and lighter, these days|pg||
nt|paulg:  his line did have a lot of play|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru:  well if @H behave he could have made it..but that would have mean @S were also 1-1 and the line should have been different|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|pelu: top-players dont like the @d-suit :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@d must be relay for clarification, and 3@c shows no major probably|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will south bid 3NT with 3 small spades ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2C prob Precision style, 5-6 clubs with possible 4-card major|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rcerreto:  tough lead|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  nothing appeals, @d looks normal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I know about 3700 people who would bid 2nt with east hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  as I said at the beginning ..probably @S finesse instead of a @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Mahaffey won the first match 17-13 against a team from Romania (with Bocchi-Maddala!?), Aspe lost 10-20 to a strong team from England|pg||
nt|granguru:  panski plays 4@H here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rcerreto:  leading the longest suit is always an option|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: good contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c more precise : no major and only one stopper ... South assumes the stopper is @s :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@H is I guess 3NT try ... Cezary knows how valid is @CQ|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  Bocchi-Madala are playing for Lavazza in another group, whatever the results page says|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: there is a little misunderstanding after explanation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphplb: we have to wait for director decision in board 22|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  David, would you lead small or an honour?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|pelu: if 1Nt = 12-14 I know as mynu who would pass - 12-14 + 10 = 22-24 and no spec fit|pg||

nt|granguru:  madala's father was the greatest VUGRAPH comentator of all times...a full show|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... bidding also looks like Lebensohn too - so one or another ... now in 4@H|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|granguru:  bridge rama at the time|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  Ralf?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Polish Specs confirming Lebensohl|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|dburn: I guess I would lead low - some danger of a blockage if partner has @dJx, for example|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am in the middle of writing a book that involves computer analysis of opening leads. We have found that leading the top honour is generally right.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|granguru:  .|pg||
nt|granguru:  In board 22 the 3@D bid inhibited Hurd to lead the suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  now claiming, for sure|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|brolucius: More often than the old text-books suggest.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: an honour, if dummy has a middle @d|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  computer analysis could change several paradigms|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|MolvaM: 3nt could be reached on this board in the open room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure they'll fix the team lineups on the results pages quickly, they have been very efficient|pg||
nt|granguru:  as for garozzo's saying ..it must have been under specific circumstsnces...such as a 7-level suit contract, or 2. a cross-ruff hand type|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chmitty: hummm ... did not see the @d Jack fall on the ace ?|pg||

nt|rcerreto: ok, we are all guessing :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe spades and longer minor|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yeslek is getting more votes|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: possibly that hand or both majors|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 4M + longer minor|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|rcerreto: someone says 4@s and a longer side suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i see the longer minor and the vulnerability. still looking for the major:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rcerreto: operator, you sure?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: did S pass?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec says 2D = hearts or the hand we have been guessing|pg||
nt|vugraphplE: yes I'm sure|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rcerreto: ok, thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto: anyone bidding and the one with a 7-5 was not|pg||
nt|rcerreto: funny, isn't it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS have 6D double dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to reach 4H now, but 5D certainly possible|pg||
nt|rcerreto: looking at W's 3@h which is apparently pass-or-correct|pg||
nt|cumino: On the other room Board 4 4@H not doubled|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I'd guess 2@d showed one major and therefore a minor onside|pg||
nt|rcerreto: just guessing though|pg||
nt|rcerreto: thanks to all the specs who are trying to help|pg||
nt|rcerreto: we didn't get a consensus over 2@d though|pg||
nt|cumino: Lanzarotti knows Partner has @D and a M due to previous pass|pg||
nt|rcerreto: N is surely puzzled by S's bidding|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|rcerreto: I've been also told that, in Norway, 2@d is played as either @h or 4@s and a longer minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: E seems to have taken the 3H bid a bit too seriously|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: but the double will probably gain a heart trick|pg||
nt|rcerreto: we don't know what H-H explained at the table|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer now likely to play small to the jack, instead of the ten run |pg||
nt|rcerreto: then it's difficult to comment N-S bidding|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: that only makes a difference to the number of overtricks though|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|rcerreto: which got to a good contract anyway|pg||
nt|toral5: hello everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi there|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ok, on HH conv card 2@d is either long @h OR 4@s and a longer minor|pg||
nt|toral5: whr do we get the live scores?|pg||
nt|vugraphplE: live scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|rcerreto: N should know that E has @s and @c|pg||
nt|toral5: ok.|pg||
nt|rcerreto: likely 2@d |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am surprised E did not play D king|pg||
nt|rcerreto: true|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  true|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  well judged|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but he needed @dJ on dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  or 3. very low level, doubled contracts|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|chmitty: next anyhow|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: ok NS play transfer over 1@c|pg||
nt|peachy: This is what commentator slang calls "coffee hand". No problems, everyone go refill your drink of choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  that's why she bid 3 :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe 2@D?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: how many @s from W? I vote for 3@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  i expect double shows the majors|pg||
nt|pelu: nice play to get 7 tricks in 2@c|pg||
nt|peachy: There certainly are very good reasons not to lead trump, but if one cant find one, then...trump|pg||
nt|granguru:  aaah yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  a good partner has the J|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|rcerreto:  oops, sorry|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anyone with me?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  with 2@d?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Closer to 3@S than 1@S, perhaps.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  1@s looks a little timid to me|pg||
nt|pelu: strange take out X by Baldurson|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a 6-card suit @hK and a stiff @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade game needs to be bid.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  good sacrifice in 5@d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1@s probably shows 3 card spades?|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - prob support x in @H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: I don't know that 1@H was right when East had indicated the majors.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe it was also meant to show real @c|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  unsure though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me a strong 3@s rise and an invite to 4@s|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and baldurson dbl is kind of a support dbl?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok he was down 2 - but recived a gift|pg||
nt|danilo1: interested in choice what/how to bid by South (1@C Polish, most often 12-14 BAL) |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Allerton may have misread 3@H but East can correct.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, this is the sort of board we were looking for, after so much drab stuff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he has a pretty good hand, in context|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you agree with the strong rise David?|pg||
nt|peachy: Strong 1C, probable 0-7 or some such 1D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|granguru:  under this premise I agree fully..the same philosophy of the 6NT lead..dont give tricks away to declarer on the initial lead.|pg||
nt|granguru:  when you have points in all side suits normally declarer has a solid trump suit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the best with this bidding is that W has shown his @h honour|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe their standard for free bids is higher than yours and mine|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C may be @D transfer, or kind of asking - if so 2@D may just show min.|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Richard Bley|pg||
nt|riccho:  Good Morning everyone :) |pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi Richard|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pelu: Easr didnt read the X from West as @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: saved by S|pg||
nt|murat: good afternoon all :)|pg||
nt|pelu: wellcome now we hace 2 x Murat :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: Although we may quibble with the odd bid or two, it seems that the players have judged it very well around the table. |pg||
nt|rcerreto:  anyway, they succeeded in bidding the par|pg||
nt|brolucius: The term 'free bid' was responsible for a lot of awful bidding many decades ago.|pg||
nt|murat: guess one of the most common names of Turkey :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  in a difficult board|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, indeed|pg||
nt|granguru:  !<s now|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s|pg||
nt|granguru:   s must lose all his losers|pg||
nt|granguru:  no uppercut now if s plays @s correctly|pg||
nt|peachy: 1@s: 16-19HCP, 4+@s, nonforcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: In any case, 3@D looks nat and invit ... |pg||
nt|riccho:  Bidding is preyumably in polish club lines here; 2@c looks like a trf|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: as Peter in Denmark :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  done|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@c is asking about the @h suit IÂ´m told|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... we are guessing bids ... NS do not (they know :))|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rcerreto:  free-bid is something very different today|pg||
nt|riccho:  so they are playing the same answers after 1@s in rebid than after 1NT? looks sensible ...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|granguru:  -1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chmitty: will not escape 2off probably|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|brolucius: I am told that 4@S failed at one table of the other semi. Do four round of clubs and a ruff with the king, leave declarer with some sort of guess?|pg||
nt|granguru:  @C would have best|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d then was probably a obligatory bid with BAL 12-14 Hands (a spec agrees here...:))|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: Good play trick 1, lead smelled like singleton (maybe doubleton) so retaining finessing opetion to clubs toward hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|granguru:  now @C is amust|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|pelu: we dont have contact to the Open room, but Board 3 _ the 3NT with 5 toptricks out - gave 10 IMPs to Lavazza|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|peachy: EW are able to produce accurate defense for max tricks their side|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|chmitty: Versace knows that Lauria has a small @c to ruff : if not, he would have cashed the @c Ace :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2 off then is the score|pg||
mc|11|nt|brolucius: Hardly because South would not lead a 4th club if his trumps were non-existent.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  think so|pg||
nt|riccho:  1@s in polish club is a 12-14 BAL Hand most of the time, but it may be also a BIG hand with 5+@s (even if I dont know, if 1@c is strongest opening here)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|rcerreto: looking at the @c suit alone, you want to play AK in case there's a doubleton honour|pg||
nt|rcerreto: looking at the transportations, you might as well duck a @c at once|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart lead would hurt this|pg||

pc|cT|nt|rcerreto: this is what he did|pg||
nt|rcerreto: looks better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: little play to 3N on lead of heart so maybe a swing to EW here|pg||
nt|rcerreto: if you keep a @s honour to get to the @c after playing AK@c and @c|pg||
nt|rcerreto: a @h switch by the defense kills dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  felt unhappy afterward, I presume|pg||
nt|pelu: as expectet (not Murat) also 1 NT in OR in Board 4|pg||
nt|pelu: west lost count|pg||
nt|granguru:  a 21-19 count|pg||
nt|granguru:  very poor fits all over|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW has 3 5-2 ones|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS only @D 4-4|pg||
nt|danilo1: if he guess rite in @H may even make 6 (do not believe) .. if Info is correct (4@H Dbled in OR). will not be good for Monaco|pg||
mb|1N|nt|MolvaM: that usually means our vugraf operator will soon close this table and reopen it to establish the link to the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: what shld tokay do? dbl?|pg||
nt|chmitty: unless the ace of trumps fell on the floor :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Operator, 2C should have been down two, maybe|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D made against the 300 here, so a big swing to Badger.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was wondering if South would overcall 1@s, easier to overcall 1NT perhaps|pg||
nt|granguru:  probasbly e could have avoided the mistake overtaking @D and playing @c9|pg||
nt|paulg:  west cannot make a penalty double these days|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: again 1Nt with a 5 card @S - |pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: and now ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 1NT 12-16 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: North was in 3NT at the other table, doubled and ran to 4@D.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be hearts and a minor, so North asks|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1NTx was sort of +380 but Soith escapes|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok: 2@d showed a 11-13 hand with 3@h. sry for this mess, but its really difficult to guess the meaning of ART bids. And its boring to be silent... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: not the best lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3d could be makable but tokay wasnt sure about 5 cards @d|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS guessing can win 3@D|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  do EW play transfer?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Transfers opposite 1@C are popular.|pg||
nt|granguru:  we will see a good fight here|pg||
nt|granguru:  as 2@S is a difficult contract to win|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: With four aces missing, it seems that the three-level may be high enough.|pg||
nt|pelu: that the problem with 1@D opening - partner dont know if u have 2 or 5 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 4@s - but US never found the @s-fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  mmm|pg||
nt|granguru:  Does S have nothing clear  to lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: and Lauria does not give up|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok this looks obvious here :) |pg||
nt|riccho:  15 vs. 8 HCP --> both players are a bit exaggerating their hands|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: Not knowing their system, North's Pass might have included better hands, and wek hands run immediately via Rdbl, that is one way of playing|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure how obvious is 3NT by East ... he is min, and 2 open suits ... OK, has 3 tens and 5-card @C ... still|pg||
nt|riccho:  now decl has 9 tricks in his bag. I c no other option than to play for @c to be 3-3 (or Hx somewhere). |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong lead .... and big diff. |pg||
pc|s9|nt|brolucius: Obviously East had read West for a much better hand than he holds.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: and I can´t see why...|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|riccho:  E needs 33 in @c without alternative, because due to communication problems he has to duck @c immediately |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Such a shame to lose IMPs unnecessarily when there are so many other ways of losing IMPs.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  could W consider his hand balanced?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then open 1NT (or rebidding, if 1NT is weak)?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was presumably non-forcing, so it is hard to see how East had enough to look for an 11-trick game.|pg||
nt|granguru:  well he treated the  hand as a croos ruffing type|pg||
nt|granguru:  and protected potential @d tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Protected diamond tricks I think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: If 1@s is´nt spades, 1nt from W looks normal for me |pg||
nt|murat: 9 tricks i guess|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|danilo1: ideal def. is I guess -3 ... now  making .. @SAK and small @C|pg||
pc|c3|nt|granguru:  now he is not so sure anymore....|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep ... may be here they are in some "hole" of their system|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: Although, 2D foes not necessarily promise 4+ diamonds|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|peachy: In my opinion, the range 12-16 is susceptible to trouble at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: kib says my suggeswted method is common in Hungary, but we still dont know if NS play that way|pg||
nt|riccho:  with 23 HCP and no fit you have to be lucky to succeed in 3NT... |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong = unlucky (lead) |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|granguru:  as we see, he changed his mind but fortunatelly N had a @S left|pg||
nt|peachy: if EW play 2/1 (which I do not know if they do)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|danilo1: waw :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  leading and slam bidding are the most expensive parts of team playing. This is another proof of that... |pg||
nt|danilo1: did he really believe that Cezary would play @C from Jxx?|pg||
nt|riccho:  declarer - much to his discomfort - found another way of handling the @c suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|MolvaM: I was asked twice the question "what are these people doing here" :)  probably looking at the strane flag combinations|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this is the European Opan Championship|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Open|pg||
nt|granguru:  excelent defense after all|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|danilo1: Adam will resolve problem ... if declar would have @HK, he will not be in hurry with @S unblock|pg||
nt|riccho:  decl may have trusted the length signal from S (it it was one...). DoesnÂ´t he know Balicki - Zmudzinski then? |pg||
pc|s4|pc|d7|pc|s5|nt|pelu: very nice defense|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|nt|granguru:  declarer can lose 4 more tricks now|pg||
nt|granguru:  for down THREE|pg||
pc|d4|nt|granguru:  panski wished he would have been in dummy now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|chmitty: As usual, Lauria "manipulates" his cards for his best benefit and will claim 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|brolucius: Going two down may make it seem a bit less of a disappointment.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|granguru:  @Sq is a killer|pg||

nt|brolucius: FIFA do not follow that advice.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so there is no restriction in countries and anybody can play with anybody from any country|pg||
nt|MolvaM: totally open event|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and even though its a European event, its open to people from other continents|pg||
nt|riccho:  -400 instead of +600 ... urks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  S should have played a @H at trick 4 in tha last hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Nort upgraded this to Strong 16+ 1C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chmitty: we can imagine NS will reach 4@s|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, ideal (double Dummy def.) was @H lead for !Q, @D back, and @H ... since @D block later ... -3 .. but NS foudnd way for  -4 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I qm surprised at 1C|pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulg:  3@h is the probably the value bid for Mahaffey, but many just put 4@h on the table and make it the opponents' problem|pg||
nt|pelu: East for sure dont like his hand after 2@D overcall|pg||
nt|chmitty: Many will open 4@s in this position|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|paulg:  South will pass, probably needs a fourth spade to double|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some might play a weak-strong 2NT on the East cards, to differentiate between strong and distributional 3@D hands.|pg||
nt|pelu: what a lead - but he will have a new chance later|pg||
nt|riccho:  heh|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rcerreto:  no way to play trumps from N|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then it should make|pg||

mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  even misguessing @d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not me|pg||
nt|murat: i mean after 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|paulg:  standard Polish lead, second highest from three|pg||
nt|granguru:  @SQ9 big helpers|pg||
nt|chmitty: let's see if declarer finds the way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: a @c at trick 2 would reveal most of the layout|pg||
nt|chmitty: North can see that East does not hold AK or KDJ @c|pg||
nt|chmitty: and not QJ@h either|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Plenty to think about before playing trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  oops|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  they found the way|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Both losing semifinalists are awarded bronze medals. There is no playoff for third place (a good decision in my view)|pg||
nt|brolucius: East hoping for a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, 3rd-4th place finals are dull|pg||
nt|brolucius: But neither team has a bronze medal in their sights at this moment.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  winning A and playing a @h back would have forced S to play trumps but...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rcerreto:  this way has a chance to discard a @h on @s|pg||
nt|pelu: why sh he X?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rcerreto:  a very good chance now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|MolvaM: looks like 4 losers but declarer will still look for an endplay to get rid of the@s loser|pg||
nt|murat: for a save or for some money|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|riccho:  another time to misguess sth for E here. Difficult to be right here after u mangled a hand like the one before. will be interesting to c if E is still inspired enought|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|pelu: score now 13-1 for Lavazza|pg||
nt|chmitty: is this the actual play ????|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer does not know that DA drops doubleton, he took a chance that E lead from QJxxx|pg||
nt|danilo1: another case for invitational bid ... and pass ... especiall when playing vs. excellent defenders ... |pg||
nt|riccho:  he should do it right anyway: S didnt open but showed @hAK now|pg||
nt|danilo1: this will go down much easier (unf. also less :))|pg||
pc|hT|pc|sT|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||

nt|riccho:  yes u are right|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  probably with USA flag because Kamil's team is register as such|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was just made on the deal where E/W went two down in 4@C, so 8 IMPs to Zimmermann.|pg||
nt|pelu: that a DD analyse|pg||

nt|rcerreto: it would work but I'm not betting on a @c return|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W knows N does not have both top clubs, so the game is to take out dummy's entry|pg||
nt|cumino: I doubt he will play @H too much cards not entry. May be spade he will play|pg||
nt|rcerreto: any reason why partner can't have @sK?|pg||

nt|rcerreto: and I agree with you|pg||
nt|rcerreto: thinking about a @c finesse?|pg||

nt|rcerreto: ah yes, he could finesse in @c and *then* playing a @d|pg||
nt|rcerreto: after having removed E's @c|pg||
nt|rcerreto: E would then be forced to play @s to dummy|pg||
nt|rcerreto: any line seems to need a blockage in @h|pg||
nt|cumino: small club works Q doesn't|pg||

nt|pelu: sorru on East|pg||
nt|granguru:  panski is trying to cash all defensive tricks bfore it is too late|pg||
nt|chmitty: a nice "challenge the champs" deal here|pg||
nt|chmitty: 7@h = 20/20|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Kamil's team is listed as transnational, not USA, in the event|pg||
mb|1C|nt|granguru:  S multi 2@D|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for Meckwell in the other room (probably not the last time we'll say that in this championship)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  I've noticed many pairs treat the Multi 2@d as weak with spades when it comes to their 2nd seat defence|pg||
nt|pelu: and 5@H close to make on a small @S-lead |pg||
nt|paulg:  it's rare to see that in the UK, but would work here|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@h from North?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk3: No credit for my hy-phen?|pg||
nt|pelu: for D = balanced 12-15 or any 16+|pg||
nt|pelu: for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  Amoil played for SA in the world teams in bermuda 2000 |pg||
nt|peachy: really light third-seater here|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: i thought that he is from Usa becouse he doesn't exist in EBL base|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  that is the norm in the UK too|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@d will be 'bid your major' (4@c would have been transfer to your major)|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes many play 2@D x= short in @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by West|pg||
nt|granguru:  and 2@d - 2@h 5+ @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is similar to the situation in the Open Room, where West doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: forcing pass in N?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Be careful because jtr is watching.|pg||
nt|granguru:  now a correct flag in W ...thanks Michal|pg||
nt|peachy: and another 16+ 1C here, maybe they have additional agreements on what constitutes a 1C opening that we do not know about |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: ??? dbl from me as E|pg||
nt|paulg:  surely not a forcing pass situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but East help him, in on @CK he played @D - ruff, @C to A @S to 10 and duck - and now endplayed - East sh play @C back and no endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  a cheap save on 4@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S has escaped a double, but the cards lie well for declarer so the lack of a double will not cost E/W much.|pg||
nt|granguru:  In the meanwhile NS surpassed the safet level of 5@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  is 6@C makeable?|pg||
nt|granguru:  after A GAROZZO's lead|pg||
nt|peachy: on the surface, looks like just lose a spade, whether the tricks are there is another matter|pg||
nt|peachy: Kib who knows NS style says they love to surprise opps with frequent tactical bids|pg||
nt|riccho:  1 trick in every suit for ew = just make|pg||
pc|hT|nt|danilo1: despite 3NT looks makable for NS ... good defense should beat it ... so good stop|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: but still a dbl....|pg||
nt|granguru:  2 discards on reds|pg||
nt|chmitty: as long as they do not surprise themselves that's fine :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: why not - u have bid game Red against green |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: its for me a good standard rule|pg||
nt|chmitty: Full brakes on, from North's standpoint|pg||
nt|chmitty: South has a lot ... can he give up ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 6 controls opposite strong club, he just cant pass|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Had the cards lain differently, not doubling might have waved goodbye to 500 or so.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may have feared a third-hand opener, but her side was vulnerable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not know that partner holds 10 points, so he cannot double 4@S even with an extra value or so. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but shouldn´t E?|pg||
nt|pelu: now N can make 1NT - topplay @Hs and only 6 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  3 discards on reds sorry|pg||
nt|granguru:  one @S given up|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The contract is doubled at both tables in the other match|pg||
nt|granguru:  so just one ruff needed|pg||
nt|peachy: It is also possible that 4S was RKC|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|brolucius: Quite right.|pg||
nt|chmitty: May be 4@s was kind of blackwood|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: it does make|pg||
nt|granguru:  not even garozzo beats 6@c here|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|peachy: WD White House team|pg||
nt|peachy: It would be nice if in a competition of this level, there were convention cards available|pg||
nt|chmitty: true :(|pg||
nt|chmitty: True also that there are many pairs in competition : huge job|pg||
nt|peachy: It makes kibitzing so much nicer, to know what the auction means|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chmitty: a suggestion could be that the players had to fill themselves an "electronic convention card" before the championship|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chmitty: that will come soon, I'm sure|pg||
pc|c6|nt|murat: he should played the Ace @h|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  it is a good standard rule for me too, but not when one hand has pre-empted|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Now East may grab @CA.|pg||
nt|dburn: chances are that since East didn't double here South might get the clubs wrong|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|murat: now he's in trouble|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: for me "multi" is nor real preemt - just a semicontructiv opening bid|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong @hA ok if 3-3 and @H 10 nevber correct|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  should she risk -420 to get 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|dburn: risk? what risk?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to risk a double in the first place.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: An excellent 6@D now|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer could have the singleton king of clubs only if she had about ten cards rather than thirteen|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  can declarer have one more @d one less @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on NS - a nice contract|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  N was declarer, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In theory, there is a club ruff, but fortunately for declarer, the defender with the singleton club also has @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting bidding test. If they bid it, I will applaud.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C is more tricky and that might be reached.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They may arrive in 6@C, though|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With problems on a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can they make 1C after a @c lead? I doubt|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the sort of board we were hoping for. No-one wants these matches to be decided on small margins after some drab boards.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @s lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c after a @s lead....|pg||
nt|peachy: In "real" championships, I think that is how it is done, these championships are open to anybody who wants enter from anywhere in the world, no qualification required|pg||
nt|danilo1: running scores now on: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|riccho:  a matter of style and system if u open the N hand with 1@c 2@c or 3@c|pg||
nt|riccho:  or even pass |pg||
nt|riccho:  3@c wouldnÂ´t be my choice anyway|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If one side wins after doing better on the big boards, then good luck to them - (even if they are not from England)|pg||
nt|murat: that was unexpected|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the contract went both ways during play and finally declarer came out as the winner|pg||
nt|paulg:  Seeing your partner pass when you have a balanced zero count is never good|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|pelu: 34 HCP - I exp slam with most tables|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s now from South?|pg||
nt|peachy: And teams can have members from any country = all transnational|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C precision style ... part of Polish @C system|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  so a precision like 2@c opening here |pg||
mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays @d before havinc cleaned trumps, another @s will set up a trumph trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: D'Ovidio has started well by emphasizing the diamonds before supporting clubs.|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS has a score sheet we all like to bring to the comparison table...all NS scores|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk3: 6@C in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Waiting for the lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: but not so easy to bid the Grand|pg||

mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Ouch!|pg||
nt|murat: would you also prefer 2@s ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Imagine winning the board with 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade lead would not beat 3NT if clubs were 3-2.|pg||
nt|brolucius: not beat 6@C, I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: true!|pg||
nt|paulg:  tougher when you have not shown your 5-card support for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: roller-coaster :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|MolvaM: this is interesting|pg||
nt|murat: Tokay should work some |pg||

pc|c3|nt|granguru:  Even if that doesnt mean anything, usually it is a good sign...|pg||
nt|chmitty: Lauria could hold : Kx KQ10xxx x Kxxx whixh would produce an excellent slam|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: Declarer does not know how hearts sit so he might duck one, but as it is, does not matter|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: would u X in West or bid 2Nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would have started with 2@d (inverted) personally, even if showing your 4-card major first seems to be growing in popularity|pg||

nt|peachy: there are 15 groups of 8 teams each|pg||
nt|chmitty: only danger to consider|pg||
nt|chmitty: ha can : a) play Ace @h and @h or b) play small @h to retain an extra entry in dummy or c) unblock @s ace and run Q @h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: but then u would mis a 4-4 fit in @H - pd could be 4-4-3-2|pg||
nt|danilo1: since @D bad ... declare cannot come to 9 trick on time .. before Nort enters with @SK 8if Cezary just continues @C)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|murat: dbl i guess|pg||
nt|pelu: for 100% 2NT|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||

pc|h9|nt|chmitty: he has choosen option a) :)|pg||

pc|h7|nt|murat: i prefer 2NT with 15-17 |pg||
nt|murat: bad 18|pg||
nt|riccho:  now he has 9 tricks in his bag |pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: Doubledummy = seeing all four hands, ducking is wrong. Not seeing all four hands, it is a normal play|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|pelu: many play that 1@D - 2@D = no 4 card major|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, 20+ IMPs swing due to a 4-1 break. Well, that's part of the game. Hard to take, though.|pg||
nt|murat: he was afraid of Q@c |pg||
nt|danilo1: @C continuation would beat|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: @cQ and @S back and Tokay will regret that he used his only entry to dummy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kibs are shocked... to play clubs from hand is purely double dummy. he cant do that|pg||
nt|pelu: but against storng defense his plan sh fail|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he can hope that @cA is with north but very hard to play for both honors to be there|pg||
nt|pelu: if S has showed distrbution in the black suits - and easy defense for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well some days even 2 club tricks could be enough|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could catch the @dQ|pg||
nt|murat: he's hopeless now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so to play for @cQx inside is not a terrible play|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|murat: he's at home again :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but even with @CQ x in S u are down, @C to J and duck, @CK duck|pg||
nt|murat: cash the diamonds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: did he really play the king?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the ace?|pg||
nt|murat: A @s and a club|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the @dJ was wining the trick|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cT|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|riccho:  so the duck didnÂ´t help theoretically, but practically only|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|MolvaM: anyway he just makes it|pg||
nt|pelu: Lawazza only in 1Nt +1|pg||
pc|sT|nt|murat: defence will give him the third spade trick|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: kibs suggest playing a low diamond to dummy initially|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: yes a mistake not to take @CQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but in this hand that brings instant death|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry Ueland in 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: i made some mistake|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: sorry|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, Allerton-Leslie will think that they may have had a very big board.|pg||
nt|pelu: same did N :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would be bidding hearts on the next round|pg||
nt|granguru:  I think it is the correct way |pg||
nt|pelu: yes and that would show @H-stopper and bad @ss|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem - at boprt tables was Ss bold @s-bid|pg||
nt|chmitty: last board for today|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  he might have tried to endplay N with @sA and another|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A question of RKCB when the spade fit comes to light.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|MolvaM: for kibs who ask|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the other table scores are unreachable|pg||
nt|murat: Lavazza should get the comfortable lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but lavaza leads by a comfortable margin of approx 30 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Thank you kibitzers, ope you enjoyed.  And thank you for your active participation with comments and questions, we are all here ONLy for you.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: 4@c from me as W|pg||
nt|Walddk3: So Zimmermann by 6 in a minute|pg||
nt|pelu: sory a solid win for Lawazza - my calculations (:)) 37-1|pg||
nt|chmitty: ty Raija :)@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Multon won the diamond at trick 2 and paused for a while before he played another spade|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: E/W fighting bravely, but hard to imagine that it will be successfully.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that looked like broadcasting a football match on radio :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a very normal way to bid on Ns hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  I played Mahaffey on vugraph in last year's Rosenblum ... luckily Meckwell were in Nickell's team on that occasion|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: All good pairs will know what to do after intervention over 4NT (in theory....)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Vriend team on their way to the final; 32-9 after a slam swing on board 23, like here|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand now, thanks to our operator Michal for a great job! Also thanks to EBL for getting these great matches shown on BBO.|pg||
nt|peachy: Also thanks to our opearor for a great job!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: it was a reasonnable 6@c slam here but that will be for another day :) SO enjoy your evening (day) and see you tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the open event at this stage consists of short matches of 10 boards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so this is the last hand of the segment|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzers, you are the life of this party, appreciate all your comments and questions!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  I think 1NT as semi-forcing is quite popular, where North might pass 1NT?|pg||
nt|riccho:  some work here for decl to deny 6 defensive tricks here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk3: The official site has a score of 30-27 in this match. Not easy to know what to believe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cronier may fear a diamond ruff in 6@S, because he has offered the lower-scoring slam with excellent spade support.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to our commentators peter lund, and murat anter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and our operator michal |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: and our kibitzers|pg||
pc|sA|nt|murat: my pleasure. thx everyone|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Walddk3: I trust our operators until proven wrong|pg||
nt|peachy: And to Pierre Schmidt and all commentators for volunteering their time and expertise.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: meckwell play semi-forcing...  generally speaking meck passes all 5332s while eric bids on with 5332 maxs|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|riccho:  typical safety play situation here in @s to lose only one trump trick|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: there are stars from each country|pg||
nt|MolvaM: including all europeans|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and the world champions from usa meckstroth rodwell too|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so just stay with us|pg||
nt|MolvaM: unofficial score is 37-1 lavazza|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but better check later with the website|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.poznan2011.pl/results|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for instance here, 2@C generally shows 4+ for meck and 3+ for roddy :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  interesting difference in styles|pg||
nt|paulg:  I thought these top pairs/teams were supposed to simulate these situations and get a consensus|pg||
nt|pelu: how do they explai that on CC?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|danilo1: tk -1 ... opening @H trick to def |pg||
nt|riccho:  but there are as usual other considerations to make as well|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bigtrain: its a matter of style|pg||
nt|danilo1: now cash 2@C |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|paulg:  well, kokish at least|pg||
nt|bigtrain: note i said generally speaking|pg||
nt|pelu: but their opp sh have that information|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|peachy: bye now, come back for more in less than 30 minutes, Round 4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: general style = agreement = on CC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they treat the 1NT as semi-forcing and announce it that way...  what they do as individuals is just my observation|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|riccho:  defenders are stripping there hands here. An endplay may be possible now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|riccho:  best play from S|pg||
nt|danilo1: Patane team leads the field at the moment|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|riccho:  a @c would have stripped partner from his last exit card|pg||
mc|7|nt|danilo1: Thanks all, CU all at 11.45 CET|pg||
nt|riccho:  in Bd 9 helgemo decided to take the @c immediately... |pg||
nt|riccho:  thanks a lot for all |pg||
