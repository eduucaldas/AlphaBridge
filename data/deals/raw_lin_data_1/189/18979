nt|glen: S attacks the 6-5 suit|pg||
nt|glen: only 6 stoppers since suit splits|pg||
nt|granguru:  I feel Jxxx is the worst lead to make in a 3NT contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ for BBO TV since BBO mobile is not working|pg||
nt|panja: if it is 5-5 per system, E should perhaps have tried to play in 5m|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and doesn´t matter in which major and 6nt on N|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 6@h better than 6@s where a 4-1 split could set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shut down pls, IMP score incorrect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maria did|pg||
nt|rcerreto: being @s 3-2, it makes no difference|pg||

mb|3N|nt|rcerreto: is the score right, now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: that seems daft with 5h makeable|pg||
nt|jfaria:  first board... W stood quiet|pg||
nt|jcomyn: do u bid 4nt w?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT is the spot here|pg||
nt|rcerreto: is in the French style 3NT a "serious" slam try like in the US?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|blum1956: 5 nj 6 tricks probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: normal contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: i feel 4th from longest and strongest works best except from an ace|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@C will find hearts, but at the cost of being too high.  Meck likeds the double fit potential|pg||
nt|roswolf: feisty bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good morning from London|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a very sharp double|pg||
nt|hedyg: system summary for EW: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=763&pid=193|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and a good close match in prospect|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello all|pg||
nt|rcerreto: seemed like that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Oliv|pg||
nt|fokal: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  partner must have around 8 points so my first choice is @d10 then a small @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators are Mike, Murat and David|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But also 4 @H, naturally|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ntmon: Open teams, 3rd round of Swiss just started|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: always lead a major against this bidding :) mind you i would have led a spade:(|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he may wish he had a spade higher than the eight|pg||
nt|jfaria:  chances are to play for A@c onside ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and i strongly dislike leading from a doubleton if pd didnt bid the suit|pg||
nt|glen: small @C would produce -400|pg||
nt|blum1956: A simple board just for the start|pg||
nt|fokal: I'm moving between tables, (my other is also playing :) )|pg||
nt|rcerreto: a pair you know pretty well, I think :)|pg||
nt|fokal: mother|pg||
mb|4S|an| |nt|hedyg: BBO mobile is still not working so pls use: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: north thinks safety first|pg||
nt|roswolf: poor raise imo|pg||
nt|roswolf: even with a 20 hcp hand the bidding suggests a lack of tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: but the cards are kind|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 5 to 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't work indeed :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be now :)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: so we would have all let this through:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: results and running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|fokal: S doesn' know what's going on in @s, (in everywhere actually), so he is letting his partner take action|pg||
nt|fokal: oups|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: now that is a dumb lead @sA is stand out|pg||
nt|leao:  hello all from sÃ£o paulo, brazil|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi mike, david :)|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|fokal: 4 @s is a blackwood, I remember now|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|jcomyn: no problem with this but brave bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  My grandmother would have claimed|pg||
nt|rcerreto: then 5@c makes sense othewise it'd have been odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda7.html|pg||
nt|jfaria:  so probably -1|pg||
mb|6H|nt|roswolf: hmm strange start|pg||
nt|bobholl: but what else :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but a spade sinks this now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hey kit, what do you think about 1NT vs X with south?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both teams have changed one pair for the second half of the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: could also play for doubleton ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: hi David :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but not now - Meckstroth needed to start eliminating the hearts|pg||
nt|fokal: 5 @d asking for @h Q 5 @s = yes with K of @s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: declarer can play spades while club entry is there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet Mahaffey hasn't benched Meckstroth-Rodwell|pg||
nt|rcerreto: simple and effective|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|rcerreto: hi Peter|pg||
nt|fokal: that's why I realized :) At first I didn't understand 5 @c|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|bigtrain: personally i like 1NT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3ntx may well have made|pg||
nt|leao:  well defended|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: so the target at the end of today is to stay at the top 27 in group A,  and top 5 in group B|pg||
pc|h5|nt|granguru:  nice deception|pg||
nt|dburn: then, he could have reached a position where he threw a diamond on the king of spades, and another on the eight|pg||
nt|dburn: and another on the ruff and discard that West would have had to give him|pg||
nt|roswolf: poof declarer will end up on the embankment - draw trumps and take the club finesse -real simple|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will get the CCs|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks -1 for a 5 imp pickup for kamras|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Sweden/cullin-upmark.pdf|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW have made a few changes since Ostend i'll try to spot them before our commentary looks silly|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/osfrunda1.html|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that the Bessis team has a mixture of French and German players - Lisicki and Bartoli were playing at Wimbeldon earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: at the 1st table Mahaffey is leading with only 5IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: their difference decreased..|pg||
nt|glen: i suggest Mahaffey play Meckwell for the last set|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  the other table is now ahead timewise|pg||
nt|yuval10: still looks like -1 though|pg||
nt|glen: yes, he was hoping that W had only 5@Hs, and then N would have followed to the first @H|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|glen: this would then allow another @H and W would often play @H K to keep @C ruff|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 27+5 = 32 teams will qualify for the knockouts. members of the eliminated teams can enjoy the open pairs event starting tomorrow|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: is that supposed to be a rubbish multi?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= multi, 2M= 10-13|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl =diamonds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so this is max 9 hcps|pg||
nt|dburn: well, rubbish is as rubbish goes - that's pretty sound, not vulnerable in first seat|pg||
nt|hedyg: i never consider a 6-4 hand as rubbish anyhow|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok bid your suit is the consensus for rdbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass would show @ds, not XX|pg||
nt|dburn: but I would be surprised to find that redouble showed diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: some play that redoubled means "I don't want to compete" - they would bid 2@s to mean "I want to compete in hearts, but not spades"|pg||
nt|roswolf: americans have a marked weakness against the multi -i t is extremely discouraged in the state|pg||
nt|3for3: that is how we play the redouble.  not sure it is best. since they are often in trouble when they enter with balanced garbage|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is no carryover to the round of 32|pg||
nt|roswolf: you would hope meckwell at least have sensible methods|pg||
nt|3for3: they do play sensible methods.  but doubling 2@D is not free, especially when the partner of the multi has some diamond length|pg||
nt|hedyg: to pass with @ds is normal i believe as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 6+ @ds|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would ignore the rdbl and bid 3@C SHOWING VALUES + clubs(going via leb would be weaker)|pg||
nt|3for3: meck usually isnt this slow|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm is south choosing between 3@C OR 4@c?|pg||
nt|dburn: he may be asking questions of West, of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK seriously declarer failed to heed the significance of the diamond lead|pg||
nt|rcerreto: what now in S?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rcerreto: a forcing bid, in their agreements, I presume|pg||
nt|pelu: its green against red, but woulfd u all overcal 1<@s on Ns hand - no suit and no values|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: 6NT has chances with a spade lead - four spades, three hearts, three diamonds, one club and a squeeze on south|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but ns might get busy in h|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s was intermediate?|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs tell me XX used to be bid your major  for EW|pg||
nt|3for3: it might be west who is thinking, but i doubt it.|pg||
nt|3for3: usually these auctions are fairly automatic for the multi side.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i had assumed that rodwell's dbl showed 12-15 bal or very strong -does anyone know for sure?|pg||
nt|dburn: doesn't look as though redouble was diamonds, at any rate - West would have bid if it did|pg||
nt|3for3: i would bet with you |pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Mahaffey probably thinks he conceeded a swing in previous board..|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as long as s passes|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2H was 5H + 5other|pg||
nt|roswolf: which basically would be totally ludicrous unless it was a singleton|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck had a 2@H intermediate option also|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ntmon: but higher suit probably wins|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3@c was obviously value-showing, given North's 3NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If any bid - 2@s|pg||
nt|rcerreto: seriously, I can't imagine passing. As bed 1@s might be|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 2@s is equally flawed, bad suit and side values|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Fiona Brown is very cautious with her barren 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive reopening by north|pg||
nt|panja: that 1Nt is a risk VUL|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    9 tricks in diamonds for n/s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if South tries 2NT though.....|pg||
nt|ady: 3MT  poor   hearts well placed   but very poor contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even 3nt seems to be making|pg||
nt|MolvaM: everything is well placed|pg||
mb|5C|nt|MolvaM: 10-13 I am told ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: some may have doubled as east-t/o of course|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or 11-13 I am also told  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@C here on ice|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no CC for NS, soemthing between SEF and 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6nt from east cold as well|pg||
nt|panja: 5 other including @S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: a lebensohl misunderstood ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not yet|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead 4th from longest!|pg||
nt|dburn: and I suppose he might make it, if East doesn't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|jfaria:  after N said he has got the blacks there is no great deal about bidding @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dutch will get on the board here|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like it|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least it is nv|pg||
nt|ady: need great luck with all suits outside diamonds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for NS of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: somehow you feel that South wants to bid 2NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: 3nt is reasonable spot. the diamond stopper looks weak, but as long as the clubs run, you just need AK@D in one hand or no @D lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|3for3: they got the latter...|pg||
nt|bobholl: small or @SQ ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: Q would also be my choice|pg||
nt|kit: this makes like difficult for Mech|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: .. now :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wikner/Kamras: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJK1.pdf|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: this may not play too well|pg||
nt|kit: he must go up, but then no sure entry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree. but better than 1@s in my opinion|pg||
nt|rcerreto: when you have @s not vuln. and your opps have bid @h vuln. you can't help but bis something, I think|pg||
nt|rcerreto: bid|pg||
nt|rcerreto: the lead helps|pg||
nt|pelu: are we looking at a pair from france bidding that way?? I am shocked :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rmb1: Yes, any other.  (But only in some events)|pg||
nt|panja: well, in that case, dbl must have been negative...and W should have taken out...or was the double penalty?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|woozle: four rounds of spades now will put South through the wringer|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi knows his side has a fit - if opps have a 9-card fit you are guaranteed an 8-card fit at least - but that doesn't mean you will find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might bid 4@S with the W hand once he knows about 4 card support since he has no valid defense vs 4@H except the trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can be defeated|pg||
nt|roswolf: the swedes on the first bd bid to 5@D for a game swing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3 bids on a 9 count now what|pg||
nt|panja: on B16, here, South is worried about @D control..|pg||
nt|panja: N should simply have bid 3Nt..but now, South is in a bind|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rcerreto: anyway, be it 1@s or 2 but, IMHO, you've to bid. But I can understand someone can't stomach it! :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: A player of the team which is in best 8 will hardly lead a spade against 6NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the bidding could well go 1@s-2@s-4@S at other tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have seen it said that at expert level you should never lead pard's major but lead your own suit and this hand is a good example of why|pg||
nt|panja: Lev trying to put pressure|pg||
nt|panja: the youngsters might just redbl...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called by Upmark|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he called TD cause 3NT was bid after a longgggggg huddle by S|pg||
nt|3for3: does the slow bid demonstrably suggest 3nt by Rodwell?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the TD will decide that|pg||
nt|roswolf: in my view yes 3nt is much safer when pard huddles|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time i had received some messages from kibs about the 3NT bid after a long huddle|pg||
nt|3for3: it may be safer.  but it needs to be DEMONSTRABLY suggested...the law's words, not mine|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it again looks that americans cant deal with the multi:)|pg||
nt|dburn: no more than an in-tempo 3@c bid would, I imagine - but we are not the Director, of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer thinks oh dear|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well who does win now|pg||
nt|athene: west's defensive plan is very easy|pg||
nt|athene: just play spades and spades and spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: and get your three trump tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ilan Herbst went 2 off in OR|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would be better-off to double 3@S rather than bid 4@H, if he feels he has to do something|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think only -1 is likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: competenty done|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 13 tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lev seems to expect more from 1@D than East will deliver|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@H not very attractive for South (unless North had doubleton diamond)|pg||
nt|panja: it will be difficult to avoid 3 trump losers here...4@H doesn't look like a make|pg||
nt|rmb1: If anything, 4@S looks easier|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best lead difficult to find: @C KING!|pg||
nt|fokal: west should still play trump ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: he's feeling he should have to, by now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|blum1956: Not that difficult - clubs is the only unbid suit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But then you must check the bidding...|pg||
nt|blum1956: Anyway, all the aces being with the declarer's side nothing may disturb making the contract|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: 1N was x'd for -300 so perhaps not such a good idea on 1|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H should be a five-card suit in my opinion|pg||
nt|MolvaM: some like to rebid 3@d with north hand with 6 solid tricks|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but he's looking for an entry by pd to cross trumps through decl.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: NS seem to have similar cards in @H and @S...but @S are 33 in EW hands..so 4@S might have a modicum of a chance|pg||
nt|panja: @CK, @H ruff, a trump...what is the fourth possibility for the defenders?|pg||
nt|rmb1: @HA :)|pg||
nt|panja: oh well......if Declarer tries to prevent @C ruff, he can't ruff anything himself...|pg||
nt|panja: but he could get 3 Clubs, 3 Spades, 2 Diamonds, 2 Hearts for 10|pg||
nt|ritong: this room switching to french|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He must put his money on @C King in South - otherwise still down with a wrong @S-guess|pg||
nt|fokal: ok, french or english , I don't mind :)|pg||
nt|ritong: nous allons installer cette salle en français|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Do we swith to french just to make me happy - merci dÂ´avance...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Et maintenant, que vais je faire...|pg||
nt|ritong: ton bonheur est notre principale préoccupation, hans|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: he could not do that after his pd doubled 3@S, Bill|pg||
nt|jcomyn: CQ and H|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: -4 800 is a big price to pay for a bidding mixup|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's probable that EW will come to 4@S on many tables either on its own or pushed, but not doubled |pg||
nt|athene: no i mean in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that would be for minors, denying 4@Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is rare that pd, when he doubles 1@s, does not have 4 cards in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: not so rare these days for the top players|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all assume pd has 4 OM when he doubles a M opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is true enough|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think E could antecipate some kind of misfit...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: but why does w keep bidding when he knows big hand on nhis left|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in which case south could choose to bid the NT game|pg||
pc|s3|nt|woozle: probably not, but leading from a nothing suit isn't completely safe either - can easily pick up (say) partner's queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody is very worried about the overtrick|pg||
nt|fokal: ou est ce qu'on en est, je suis arivé au milieu de la donne donc je ne sais pas trop ce qu'il se passe|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: levazza mean business by the looks of things|pg||
nt|jfaria:  9 tricks is quite a bit in this layout|pg||
nt|panja: I thought @CK was not a good choice....for West|pg||
nt|pelu: Monaco in 3@H - 1@H - 2@S P P, D P 3@h|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: ace and another trump lookes obvious as he wasnt in 4|pg||
nt|glen: should declarer have played @S ace then @s|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think doubling just says you don't have the offensive potential in hearts to commit to bidding 4 over 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not good for south|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment bill|pg||
nt|athene: so you  can still have auctions like 1@S X 3@S X pass 4minor pass 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: saying ok, we might want to play here, but we don't have to|pg||
nt|roswolf: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: greed?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an error by south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|MolvaM: actually he should want the @sK to be offside|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the first bd south led @sA AGAINST 4@h for -1|pg||
nt|ritong: pendant ce temps, notre jeune amie nathalie frey va faire son contrat|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|panja: it might still make....unless @HQ entry is knocked out.So W must win @S, and switch to @HJ perhaps..let us see|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like two trumps for defence|pg||
nt|panja: no..@SJ and back next..that should be normal now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame anti-Bessis - et il va gagner. Meilleure entame:  Roi de @C - du Roi doubleton|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I didn't remember French players being so aggressive|pg||
nt|rcerreto: times are changing|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: he will get what he deserved|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|c9|nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|athene: nice line, trying to make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: madala is in the interesting contract of 2S next room|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rmb1: Too many red suit losers|pg||
nt|panja: but for North's refusal to bid 2Nt..this deal would have been over long ago|pg||
nt|rmb1: Board 15 was flat in 4@SX+1 on the same auction|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: playing for @CJx onside|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|cJ|nt|athene: and even trump break|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rmb1: Apparently, West needed to play a @D at trick 2 to threaten a diamond overruff and North needed to play a small @H at trick 3 to establish 2 @H tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: sur une main a passe général possible|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|dT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: good try|pg||

nt|glen: das auto game force?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-15 HCP   still many possible shapes|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|glen: 2@H must be game force and says "okay, i give up, please provide a hint on your hand type"|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: so after 16 boards difference is 18IMP, so everything can change :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H =  natural or NT values    |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or could be sort of natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: piek will clarify his @S holding|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: but our currently leader is still Bessis|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|glen: so both players have shown values, but not certain what their hand types are yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in the other match   meckwell in 6@D  their counterparts 6N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=@S stop|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you must be right - I would be expecting East to raise to 3@h |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N does NOT deny 4@H   [as we see :)]|pg||
nt|glen: and now E bids 2NT with a void, okay with a @S stopper too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the principle of showing the most economical feature first?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about Smirnov's options now  other than he could ask for 4@H  if he had a hand that was interested|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/osfrunda1.html|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: information www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could he ask for 4@s (not that he wants to)?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: not after 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: clarification   i don't think he can  after 2@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with no suit agreed, East may take this is quantitative|pg||
nt|glen: S has the copyright on that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|glen: it certainly looks a slam invite if W could force with a lower bid|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: Mr Piekarek is still thinking|pg||
nt|glen: one big advantage to screens is to not see partner's pain while you think about passing|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice bid|pg||
nt|glen: score now correct at: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/osfrunda1.html|pg||
nt|glen: not including this set|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @HQ working value after 2@H  good 6 card suit ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so both matches  one table 6N one table 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what would contract be at your local club game?|pg||
nt|glen: local club game: some grands, various slams, some games, a partscore, two doubled contracts|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: yes, but players at my table don't write results of boards :(|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: EW play for germany but both started elsewhere  [i hope i get this right]  Smirnov was from Russia   Piekarek came from Poland|pg||

nt|MolvaM: south is happy with 2 aces and 3 card support|pg||

nt|panja: do you like the 2@H bid?|pg||
nt|bobholl: j of @D now 6 only|pg||
nt|kit: 4 spades, 1 in each other suit?|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes ok count to 13 is sometimes difficult|pg||
nt|bigtrain: once the @HQ scored 7 seems likely|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if not careful 8 even|pg||
nt|ritong: french room , mike:)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|woozle: Count signals should sort out the club suit for the defense when North has the ace|pg||
nt|kit: better than other room though|pg||
nt|bobholl: much better :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i like X alot more than 2NT there|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: non-poles cant pronounce all the consonants in his name|pg||
nt|leao:  indeed he might|pg||
nt|leao:  but he also might fear @c ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: in 2 he won't go all out|pg||
nt|leao:  and heÂ´s in the wrong hand to takcle trumps|pg||
nt|MolvaM: lev's 3@c bid was the winner here|pg||

pc|d3|nt|roswolf: 3nt shows 5 hearts i am told :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: certain to get heart right|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well lev's @c9 converted the winner to a push I guess|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: 6Nt best contract - could make even if pd D not running - fx on 2-4-6-1 |pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: yes i know 1@D shows hearts but only 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|panja: why bid for 8 tricks when you can take 7 and get a plus score? |pg||
nt|leao:  nicely done|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd2 south in the other room tried 3@S-2- 14 IMPS TO THE DUTCH|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: cutting his losses -1|pg||
nt|rmb1: I prefer it to Pass|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: i know, but they told me that i should write german flag :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the EW system is called  Baltic Club  sort of a spinoff of Polish Club + some of their own|pg||

nt|roswolf: what 3@H would mean is a mystery:)|pg||
nt|athene: ok so with a 3nt bid and only four hearts, south would have done something else|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo responds 2@C on strong balanced hands with a 4-card major|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is to conceal the major if you don't have a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|athene: so if you respond showing a major then bid 3nt you promise 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: another kibber suggests they may use 3@S rebid by south as puppet to 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though NS are doing the same sort of thing|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd for -1?|pg||
nt|dburn: delay perhaps caused by return of Director to table|pg||
nt|3for3: south made an interesting pass of the double of 1@H in CR.  Terrible heart spots.  I'd have bid some number of NT myself|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: They will talk with TD after the match |pg||
nt|jcomyn: still a present of 6 imps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i guess i could be convinced either way|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Mais on est dÂ´accord avec une de chute?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: a technical finess- enter dummy on @hA and play a @d - if @d are A to 10xxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  a quiet @s game now|pg||
nt|bobholl: i almost never bid a 5 card suit against multi (2@H is info on @S)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|MolvaM: we would be happy if a few voids would be there but ok :)|pg||
nt|glen: on bd 22, Tokay, S in other room, started trumps with ace for +140 and 5 imps|pg||
nt|ritong: si|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S alerted but looks like sign-off|pg||

nt|MolvaM: welldone tokay :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: things don't go "the italian way " :)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|roswolf: great minds eh glen!?:)|pg||
nt|glen: hey, canadians own "eh"|pg||

nt|bobholl: other room reached 4@S getting a @H lead|pg||
nt|leao:  strong @c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: boy what happens now|pg||
nt|ntmon: when opps bid 2 suits and we look for 3NT, we bid the suit we have stopped |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 4+|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult salm to reach 6@D seems clearly superior|pg||
nt|athene: NS can bid lots of hearts but that will only encourage east to bid a slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok here is the CC for NS now: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJKeng.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be awkward for n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: which is the awkward part?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes all this early morning excitement is a bit much for an aul fella like me|pg||
nt|jfaria:  no reason to play anything else but 4@s|pg||
nt|panja: 6@C will be a good spot on B18|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes kind of|pg||
nt|ady: another part score hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ntmon: but i agree .. NS on the way to problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart lead against nt is marked lucky east has 10xxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: getting to grand?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Losing @D finesse in 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: At the other table, North switched to a diamond at trick two, but chose the lowest...South, duly misled, led one back|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S will make if the defence foolishly try to cash @HAK, but not if they switch to a club to take out the entry to the diamonds, of course|pg||
nt|glen: thanks Hedy, typical swedish cc, very little blank space left|pg||
nt|dburn: Kokish hasn't yet managed to persuade Rodwell to overcall 1@s instead of doubling|pg||
nt|leao:  ok, ty|pg||
nt|rcerreto: will NS stop below game?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|MolvaM: heart lead and low spade switch?|pg||
nt|granguru:  and west @HJx|pg||
nt|bobholl: and in NT is much more than in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: like well into the soup|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I'm still bidding 3c on the s hand before you have your blood spilled|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh then @sA disappears|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is on in many denominations and level is difficult to judge too|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2 nt must be several layouts, otherwise I doubt W would enter tehe auction|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mais Nord doit contrer 1 @D - et voila|pg||
nt|ritong: quelle bonne idée, hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: the only problem with 3@C is that should not be enough |pg||
nt|ntmon: at least they're on the same wavelenght|pg||
nt|roswolf: advance sac taken|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX doesnt even start to show this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: it really makes no difference to their qualifications|pg||
nt|panja: but with @DQ off, it won't make...|pg||
nt|roswolf: once when behind in a match i passed a strong club with a hand like south's and earnt myself a big swing - 1@c was the only making contract!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i was a junior at the time of course!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7@D is best with @H K rigth but you can't guess that|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, now 4@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree hedy|pg||
nt|3for3: kokish basically believes there is no hand too strong to overcall.  Rodwell doesn't see it that way here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|MolvaM: even if misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|hedyg: anything is fine as long as they avoid 5@ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7nt makes because @HK rigth and @C good for 4 tricks |pg||
nt|rcerreto: good judgement|pg||
nt|rcerreto: now you're left with right guessing in @d|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: yup i think duboin was taking the time to light the proverbial cigarette|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently in standard Polish leads J is led from J10 doubleton|pg||
nt|MolvaM: in a close match quiet part score boards gain more importance. the last board was quite heavy in that sense|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: much of a muchness|pg||
nt|glen: i thought they played for lavazza and coffee|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: the grand is missed i fear|pg||
nt|hedyg: Thomas thinks XX shows 3 @ss only|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 4 card fit and singleton @c he had other bids available|pg||
nt|roswolf: meckwell will probably have a similar challenge in the other room|pg||
pc|cK|nt|blum1956: clear pass for North on 2@s from my point of view, but Pszczola is a world champion which I am not|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could get 6 proverbial IMPs fine for that  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange not to correct to @s|pg||
nt|panja: the bidding doesn't really address this slam exploration...if W had @DQ instead of the @SQ, for example, it would have been a cold 6@C|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobholl: may be true now too|pg||
nt|MolvaM: meckstroth plays 3C open room which could well make|pg||
nt|ritong: mieux vaut ne pas se tromper d entame|pg||
nt|ritong: par sud, c est meilleur, pardon|pg||
nt|fokal: il aurait pu dire 3P plutot que 3K|pg||
nt|pelu: many play 3@H here as GF, 2@H as invit, and Jump 1. round 5-8 (WJS)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|leao:  if he use the @s 10 as an entry heÂ´ll be able to make one red siut finesse|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mais 620 su table|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rcerreto: hmm|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jfaria:  Question is  if 2nt GF W knows NS will win the auction , so no point in telling where the gold is..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if he makes, this will be a double partscore swing for mahaffey of I thk 6 imp|pg||
nt|fokal: il faut que le partenaire sache quoi nommer avec un 4-3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: seems to gain a few imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: not that junior but only making contract :)|pg||
nt|leao:  looks like thatÂ´s the plan|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: they did well to stop below game, but even this is probably not going to make|pg||
nt|ritong: c est vrai, oliv, mais ça aurait laissé une chance au flanc|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: seems Madala decided they would take no @H tricks if EW played|pg||
nt|glen: and the cash out stops at 4 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: better cash the K@H now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder if n passes what happens|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|leao:  red suit=round suit|pg||
nt|leao:  thats what i meant :)|pg||
nt|leao:  no return is safe now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ntmon: reaching 4@H X would not be problem on tables, where W passes and E opens with @S preeemt|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that may mean an imp to the israelis|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: they took all their tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: always depressing for a defender when declarer wins your opening lead and swiftly returns the suit|pg||
pc|hK|nt|3for3: especially at NT!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|woozle: Fiona did well on lead with a trump...a heart (or club) lead would have cost a trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is like an insult|pg||
nt|ady: trump leads should set 3@C|pg||
nt|fokal: (le partenaire peut etre 44 dans les majeures apres tout|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ce n est pas vrai - entame sous l As dans une main de 20-30 PDH - jamais vu!|pg||
nt|fokal: 3 @d etait sans doute un relais pour connaitre 3C ou 4P en face|pg||
nt|ritong: jean charles allavena a plutot bien analysé la sutuation  il a estimé qu il était cuit et que sa meilleure chance était de tenter un truc|pg||
nt|fokal: ou tout bonnement une enchere intelligente pour que ce soit le partenaire qui joue les Piques|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah oui - mais ici, dans la campagne, on entame atout de temps en temps|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blum1956: as opposite to 2@s which is makeable|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: nothing is much better here|pg||
nt|3for3: I like a low club better than the king|pg||

pc|d2|nt|roswolf: ah le correction|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|3for3: both of these teams will surely qualify for the KO's.  Kamras was leading the field entering this match|pg||

nt|bobholl: vwd|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 7@D is best by West because there are certain squeeze chances when they can't attack hearts, but it's not a grand slam you want to be in|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: yes for once not a lot of scope for action|pg||
nt|leao:  hard for W to duck that @s queen|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes sheer pertinacity as terence reese once remarked|pg||
nt|rcerreto: very dangerous board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nest slam - 7@s as @s are 2-2|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 6@s are easy but 7...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: next....|pg||
nt|rcerreto: if you play A@s when a honour falls in E...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: la main de nathalie vaut elle un cue bid? je dirais oui|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: only two certain losers, but I'm not sure how many winners|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the @D lead signposted|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is GF raise with singleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D shows 1 singleton(unspecified) + gf i am told|pg||
nt|athene: some specs might be wondering why east didn't just double|pg||
nt|roswolf: another crazy poor suit overcall imo|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 6NT is best if you only see ew (5@D 2@H 2@S 3@C)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: odds are to finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D? GF realy?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: this Frenchmen play a very peculiar natural, let me say!!! :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: also 7@c would have better chances than 7@s but... it fails|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: there are two possible explanations|pg||
nt|panja: the problem is with the 2Nt bid....whatever 3@S meant, W could hardly have crossed 3Nt...|pg||
nt|leao:  so they bid game on board 3 in the other room|pg||
nt|kit: 3@S gets them to poor game|pg||
nt|ady: 140 in fact last hand so 6 imp swing|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but I don't think thay can get to @c after this start|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: finding h here will be tricky|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and game on|pg||
nt|athene: firstly they might play x as t/o of hearts (unlikely)|pg||
nt|glen: the modern style: bid five card majors, count points later|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= semi-forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT general gametrial..|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@d has some sort of play - not sure how good a contract it is|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Est Ã¡ la main parfaite pour 4 @H directement|pg||
nt|ritong: elle estime meme qu un cue bid a saut s impose|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that 2@D is Thomas-style - preper the lead for 6@s|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: secondly he just wants to emphasize he has real playing strength in diamonds so there might be a sac|pg||
nt|glen: the semi-forcing NT allows for opener, once having counted points, to pass to avoid trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: the term semi-forcing will always be a puzzle to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy +90|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus it is NOT forcing?|pg||
nt|hedyg: or just 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have noticed that the dutch are not conservative bidders|pg||
nt|leao:  they are high enough|pg||
nt|ady: normal K@D lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: protection question for West - he goes quietly|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1nt shuts out everyone|pg||
nt|ady: or queen their lerad agreement|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and as usual, when you lead fro KQJxx, 10xxx goes down in dummy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bocchi plays 3@c open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: whereas a lead-directing double could be as little as @DKQ10x or so|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@C : strong splinter - agre @D :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: exclusion blackwood I think|pg||
nt|rcerreto: asking for aces excluding the @h A|pg||
nt|pelu: ok|pg||
mb|7D|nt|dburn: trumps 3-2 plus some work, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: much depends on methods now|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice no XX from Gino to show Kx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean: it is either forcing or it isnt?|pg||
nt|granguru:  correct|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1NT conventionally asks for point count? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: well your supposed to bid again if you have a decent hand very like drury without the guaranteed trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: , see above |pg||
nt|glen: semi-forcing is a terrible term, but was meant to distinguish between 1NT not-forcing limited to about 10 pts, and the modern style where it can have game invite values|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to pass surely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  doubt trading a plus for a a minus|pg||
nt|leao:  this shud make with the @s !!!!! finesse|pg||
nt|leao:  no need to finesse now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S in the context of a strong club system|pg||
nt|bobholl: which makes so not bad :)|pg||
nt|kit: I think need some singleton to bid 3@S|pg||
nt|rcerreto: N isn't going to pass this!!|pg||
mb|7S|nt|blum1956: not enough entries to make the @d s work and too bad @h distribution to crossruff effectively|pg||
nt|woozle: On the last board, Harding in the other room tried 3NT with the matching 4333s - down one also, but had chances for 10 in|pg||
nt|roswolf: brakes need to be applied now|pg||
nt|roswolf: simple auction|pg||
nt|fokal: 3 @d signifie j'ai l'enchère de 1@h passe 3 @h si c'est le partenaire qui a ouvert; c'est a dire soutien de 4 atouts constructif|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: it is a terrible term indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but rarely does in my experience|pg||
nt|granguru:  for me semif means "you may pass if you have a sub min hand  or a min with a bal distr"|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@S denies a short suit|pg||
nt|pelu: so the bluff 2@D force N to bid 7@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: i'd say more than some :)|pg||
nt|3for3: but the black JT's are very useful|pg||
nt|hedyg: iv) For the KO stage, teams not in the first eight rankings in the Swiss A are re-ranked from 9-32 according to seeding based on WBF/EBL masterpoints. The teams ranked 1-8 in the ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Swiss A, in order, each pick a team from the rest of the teams seeded 9 to 32. After these first eight choices the right to select the opponent passes to the highest remaining ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: seeded team and so on until the bracket is completed. For the purposes of composing brackets the number in the bracket is |pg||
nt|hedyg: determined by the order of the selection|pg||
nt|dburn: if North leads a heart, you have to commit yourself at once - if he doesn't, you have some breathing room|pg||
nt|bobholl: when they start with 4@H and 4@C that won't make|pg||
nt|leao:  well, if theyÂ´re good enuf to bid, theyÂ´re good enuf to lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: OTT|pg||
nt|athene: i guess one other advantage for 4@D over double is it takes some room away from opps|pg||
nt|rcerreto: well, this bid won't make the school books :)|pg||
nt|pelu: new french style?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: now... let's see the lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: 6@d by East may be better than 6@d by West for that reason, but there's not a lot the Swedes can do about that now|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 4 losers :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not quite fair - if he makes:)|pg||
nt|pelu: all exp @S will give S a problem|pg||
nt|rcerreto: the trump lead would have likely pinpointed the suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Makes? Hardlyt with 4 top losers|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: which red suit to try is the question|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ntmon: very lucky for NS|pg||
nt|fokal: une manche sur la pointe des pieds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|woozle: A bit sad here that the third diamond will be ruffed with the short defensive trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: if Rodwell does lead a heart, he should choose the eight and not the jack|pg||
nt|rcerreto: Charles chose wisely not to lead trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: since he probably would not lead the jack from KJ|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, declarer may need to pick a black suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: easier for us, as usual|pg||
nt|3for3: those black suits look very similar..|pg||
nt|panja: this could still go down...|pg||
nt|bobholl: but a @H lead is only DD|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of imps changing hands here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: 3 clubs should just make|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: ok, it looks here as though madala has shown a diamond control|pg||
nt|panja: after @DA..EW cash Clubs and exit with @S...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: i think n/s were reckless here although who was to blame we may never know|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with a short suit and good hand they bid 2NT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|leao:  yes, no flat board yet|pg||
nt|leao:  good spectator sport|pg||
nt|rcerreto: and now...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jfaria:  But S really has got hte better hand... everybody talking...|pg||
nt|fokal: swing possible (probable) pour monaco A|pg||
nt|fokal: 21 points dans la ligne, régulier en face de régulier|pg||
nt|fokal: mais les jeux collent bien|pg||
nt|rcerreto: percentage play|pg||

nt|jcomyn: probably and then 3d forcing with at least 5-5|pg||
nt|hedyg: a Zia cuebid of 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: is bocchi teaching madala some interesting italian phrases at high speed now? if so, chances are, it was south's fault|pg||
nt|roswolf: another routine game hand|pg||
nt|glen: may see some italian science here|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it has some second meaning here. idont have a great hand and 3cards to raise you|pg||
nt|hedyg: and new leader|pg||
nt|3for3: shall they try 6@D again?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@H - only have to avoid 6@H|pg||

nt|bobholl: bochi madala neatly in 3 @S |pg||
nt|Walddk2: and aceless|pg||
nt|fokal: hum|pg||
nt|rcerreto: this could move a lot of imps|pg||

nt|rcerreto: well, hard not to agree|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: didnt work - it is good to see that the top players are also mere mortals:)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yeah... but then you look at LTC -- only 5 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: maybe the 4-1 trumps could bring some action|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could get feisty|pg||
nt|dburn: number 11 buses, these - you can't make six diamonds for hours, and then two come at once|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a nice unlucky game 4 EW|pg||
nt|jfaria:  both red cards misplaced|pg||

nt|kit: but sure losers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: true|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S feels like an underbid but i hate 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: or obsfuscation more like|pg||
nt|andyv:  good evening all|pg||
nt|ritong: le team bessis gagne la donne 3, en partie grâce au saut fitté de l autre salle|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: we have been seeing a lot of that|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Joao:)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @D + major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It might be the Meckwell defence to 1NT :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after 5 quiet boards, we were expecting a deal where everyone holds an 8-card suit and a few voids.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: XX= Hx(x) in @H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hey i am old enough already without taking a few hours off me. MORNING so|pg||
nt|ritong: qui leur a permis de jouer la bonne partielle a @d|pg||
mb|1N|nt|glen: 2@C is the science|pg||
nt|panja: and play carefully..on @D lead, for example..you have to go up with @DA, remove trumps and hope @C suit gives you a trick|pg||
nt|leao:  heÂ´ll invite 3NT, and it shudnt be accepted|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt all pass i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: srtange move by east with a flat 8 count|pg||
nt|leao:  and 2 jacks|pg||
nt|kit: problem is relative lengths undefined|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: 6@H a good save here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The advantage is that you are one level lower if partner prefers the minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: compared to 2@H, H + a minor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: *says the author of wo9olsey :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but than you now 5@H :)|pg||
nt|kit: depends on how many hearts 2@H shows|pg||
nt|bigtrain: usually 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: every defence has its good and its bad hands :)|pg||
nt|kit: I mean if 2@H is hearts + minor|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: 2@C is a reverse inverted minor - it shows a raise to the two-level|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@c rather than 1@d was an interesting choice|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 4 Fantunes in 7@s|pg||
nt|dburn: now, if West can bid 4@h as a sort of "last train" or "Bluhmer"...|pg||
nt|roswolf: the red bars goad the players again|pg||
nt|bobholl: if opponents points all in one hand you need less to make/invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: natural or 16/17+ many hand types|pg||
nt|leao:  id pass this (and perhaps apologize later)|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Pepsi bids only 2NT...he apparently has lower standards for vulnerable 2H bids than I do|pg||
nt|woozle: Seamon-Molson raises to say "yes, I did overcall vulnerable"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and the @S Ten is a vital asset|pg||
nt|woozle: I suppose she would never have raised without it|pg||
nt|dburn: ...which apparently he can...|pg||
nt|panja: and now, on @C lead by E.....this would go down|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@S splinter|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@D cue |pg||
nt|panja: right, and 4@D cue...so @C lead is automatic...|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the good thing about DONT/Meckwell is you avoid giving the opponents cardX|pg||
nt|bigtrain: which is a very bad thing|pg||
nt|bigtrain: oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now thats aggressive but i suppose the 5-card suit is useful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice contract|pg||
nt|dburn: ...then East-West have a chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows his hcps, though not heavy , are good|pg||
nt|3for3: not sure what rodwell's double of 4@H was, but it will make it easier, as now east can show heart control.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Upmarks XX= 1st rd control|pg||
nt|jfaria:  played by the "wrong" side, S on lead could try a @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@h probably shows any 4 card without strength being a factor|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would pass and NOT apologise|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ntmon: actually E hand is rather strong in 15-17 range|pg||
nt|ntmon: roles home now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rolls even|pg||
nt|ntmon: rolls* :)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S was natural, usually 2@Ss, less than 8|pg||
nt|roswolf: for once i understand their bidding:)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think W will try the @h and will delay @d till the end|pg||
nt|leao:  it wud look better with the @h 10|pg||
nt|roswolf: it has been led the 8 will do!|pg||
nt|leao:  but the 8 is a nice card to have for West|pg||
nt|rcerreto: this a French special: anticipate a 4 card major with the strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks as the cards lie|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I always liked it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|glen: 3@H was the big hand, natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c either nat or any strong hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: according to the CC|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: then 3@H= strong hand with @s+@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: impressive bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: no cover :(|pg||
nt|rcerreto: so strange almost no one out of France play this way|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dburn: good bid, that|pg||
nt|3for3: well done ew|pg||
nt|dburn: still, even if West had only bid five, East might have bid six|pg||
nt|andyv:  may lead @ss twice to hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now @s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: exactly|pg||
nt|andyv:  even dbl dummy can't see a way to strip the hand and throw S in to break the @d suit|pg||
nt|leao:  not now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: i didnt expect this contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: should go -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you bid 1NT as W over 1@D?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: wierd e/e are still on tilt|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: no i wouldnt|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm maybe that is a xfer too|pg||
nt|3for3: aha.  the save is found.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 has 5 to 2 chance to be in south :)|pg||
nt|leao:  cud be|pg||
nt|roswolf: or even e/w|pg||
nt|leao:  :)|pg||
nt|leao:  if N had 109 in @h he can block the suit at some stage|pg||
nt|leao:  "he" meanind declarer|pg||
nt|leao:  meanind=meaning|pg||
nt|leao:  @d and @h back?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even 4nt is not so comfortable with 31 hcp here altho he will probably make 4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: h lkead d switch and another h but who would find that|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a natural raise you mean bill:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: "only" -5?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jfaria:  that doesnt solve the problem, but maybe  a favourable ending can be reached better that 50% chance after @h fails|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy can' take the @h hook|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's DD analysis and they do it :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: they don't have safe card dbls vs. art 2m -- might stop right there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: board 18 corrected to 7 imp|pg||

nt|ady: was safer trun Q@C trick 2|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|dburn: only four, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh only 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: cheap!|pg||
nt|3for3: 8 easy aces|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S must not try a @d now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club exit|pg||
nt|andyv:  he has 2 easy exits so no need to rush @d|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: it's good to see people raising clubs|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't happen often :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes of course they play transfers over 1@C -doh:(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh no|pg||
nt|andyv:  but what do I know|pg||
nt|jfaria:  MUST NOT :(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why do that with 2 easy options|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now there is a psic warfare|pg||
nt|andyv:  now West has to think since S wasn't being forced to lead @d that he may be underleading his Ace. |pg||
nt|jfaria:  Should accept the gift and let run to J?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think it's a gift|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: and bocchi-Madala found that defence in open room|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but could s be underleading the ace - unlikely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  as the cards lie it is|pg||
pc|d8|nt|woozle: Fiona decided that spades aren't promising on lead, so tries a surprise attack in clubs. Pepsi is surprised, but not so surprised that he will forget to take his now ten top tricks|pg||

pc|s4|nt|bigtrain: cardX are very useful|pg||
nt|bobholl: did tokay really play @C 9 ?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: any system should go out of its way to reduce the number available to the opponents|pg||
nt|bigtrain: a CARD X doesn;t say anything about suit lengths - only shows values and sets up forcing auctions - facilitates penalty vs play options|pg||

nt|blum1956: If North opens a strong 1NT, what will West bid&|pg||
nt|blum1956: ?|pg||
nt|woozle: North much too strong for a strong notrump...although at favourable I might open 2NT|pg||
nt|woozle: A strong notrump is the second best preempt in bridge, after 2NT|pg||
nt|woozle: Is Pepsi deep in the tank, or is this a coffee break?|pg||
nt|blum1956: This time 1@c is the worst option for North - East may even preempt in @s s wich solves the problem for EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but nobody bid h - or s I suppose, so|pg||
nt|ntmon: Lavazza builds a sound, deserved lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: better take the shortcut :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
nt|hedyg: just wanted to see if we were awake?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a simple pass would have earnt a nice 5 imp swing|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda5.html  running now|pg||
nt|3for3: certainly interesting hands..|pg||
nt|rmb1: Netherland Juniour tried 6@C -1 on  19, another 11IMP to Mahaffey.|pg||
nt|panja: B21, 3N does not make for NS..but they have 27 HCP..so they will try to bid some game...|pg||
nt|fokal: et pourtant il y a une intervention a 1 @h....|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@D would be a splinter we assume|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not want to do that with a singleton ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will brush the intervention aside|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be carnage|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mahaffey has dropped to 6th|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d one major|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D the other?|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this might end up in carnage|pg||
nt|leao:  another one... agree|pg||
nt|leao:  this has to be @h, no?|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess multi|pg||
nt|ady: another game    likely 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 3NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: green vs red sementa feels free to overcall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Quand on sÂ´arrete Ã¡ 2 @H Ã¡ la donne 5, on Ã¡ vu trop de surenchÃ©res non-serieuses chex le partenaire...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  chez|pg||
nt|ritong: un coup de tournoi par paires|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: 3@D will be a spade raise anyway; presumably 3@C would be hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: unusual vs unusual|pg||
nt|3for3: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: might try 3nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, very tempting|pg||
nt|roswolf: west is on some sort of trip if he overcalls 1nt on that rubbish|pg||
nt|leao:  so they mite end up in @s.... less dreadful|pg||
nt|pelu: on board 19 they saet the fire themselves - sh be a normal easy board to 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d showing invite + in @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sementa's pass says what?  I have diamonds? |pg||
nt|roswolf: they will play in 4@H|pg||

nt|roswolf: the auction in the other room was ultimately a phantom|pg||
nt|dburn: Cullin lurking|pg||
nt|andyv:  but dblton in @s may slow him down|pg||
nt|panja: EW, of course, might create obstacles in their path and save them|pg||
nt|leao:  hu-oh|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: and can add toit here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c would be invite + in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has sufficient defence|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just that he has nothing to say|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting problem for W|pg||
nt|leao:  3NT will NOT be a good contract|pg||
nt|ady: either making|pg||
nt|ritong: 3SA chez nord, toutes les levées si ouest entame petit @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Fiona, bids the routine (at this vul) 2S|pg||
nt|roswolf: to the limit for west|pg||
nt|andyv:  most prudent is 4@c|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he has got the "expected"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: well predicted!|pg||
nt|roswolf: west must make his own arrangements|pg||
nt|andyv:  enterprising is 4@h|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@c looks ok to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: McGann takes the quick path to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: good judgment|pg||
nt|athene: does bocchi have to find the diamond lead for 500 here?|pg||
nt|dburn: trying to look like a man saving in 4@s|pg||
nt|panja: you mean board 18...6@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: north ignores the diversion|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@h was?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ask heart stops? or transfer to spades?|pg||
nt|pelu: not easy - but still no fire :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: maybe this is a hand t show invite + in @H and when d bids @H bid @s to show both majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: the noose tightens|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he has no 4 cards in any other suit than @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: some superbergen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: and disappears up his own exhaust|pg||
nt|leao:  maybe, even with a @h lead...|pg||
nt|leao:  it will make now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok lev said spades|pg||
nt|ady: club lead and heartt return best|pg||
nt|rcerreto: once you normally sets @s as suit, investigating the trump strength is way easier|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: hmmm ok this looks as though bocchi made a forcing pass and now a slam try in spades which is surely a bit optimistic with his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south tempted to bid on!?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: duboins hand looked so good after rho opened 1@d. now it looks not so attractive|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy vey!|pg||
nt|roswolf: high noon shoot out|pg||
nt|glen: sementa rips up cards and leaves table|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a void usually means action|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose is not clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: why XX?|pg||
nt|glen: actual it is xxxx since previous xx|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely if Sementa had a better suit he would have bid it?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: Axxxx to Kxxx doesn't make for a good grand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: now dbl?|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth has seen his sort before, though|pg||
nt|3for3: well, his hand suggests bidding too |pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= 14-16|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is an upgrade|pg||
nt|roswolf: or 13 actually:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual in your singleton|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: jaki wynik , wyniki w necie nie dzialaja |pg||
nt|andyv:  with 5 losers, it's too much to ask for a passed hand to cover 3 of them|pg||
nt|panja: 1@S seems like denying a 4 M...I am not sure it shows @D Suit ...|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S part of transfer-response structure to 1@C -  denies either major|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: good judgment again|pg||
nt|hedyg: trying to put N under pressure?|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: oops|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes even i would make this|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks tadeusz (our fine operator in poznan)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @H jouÃ© par Nord - meme par equipes, sportif - mais gagne de temps en temps...|pg||
nt|fokal: pas de rebid après 1P 1SA (on est trop beau pour passe), c'est pour ca qu'il a ouvert d'1SA directement)|pg||
nt|pelu: better the A10xx, K9xxx - whit out @S 10 9 would have mede|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bnut easier when @s are 2-2 Rodolfo:)|pg||
nt|pelu: better than :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: will n/s run out of red cards|pg||
nt|kit: 4 hearts, 2 spades, 2 aces = 8 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: but very difficult|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW in OR might know that they're behind, so try to push|pg||
nt|panja: only 8 tricks for NS..bu cashing Diamonds might lead to some useful situation|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: passssssssssssssss|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely no need to correct to 2@H!|pg||
nt|roswolf: might give preference|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well 2 imps to the swedes|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot be a forcing pass opposite what might be just invite|pg||
nt|glen: i still think ripping up cards will result in lowest possible minus score|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 8 card fit is better than nothing|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh no !|pg||
nt|hedyg: might try 3NT after X of 3@D?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: at times, having the trump 10 is a real curse :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: Lev judged 3NT with AQ hearts  and 3 small spades better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spades and game-forcing probably|pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: ahh it goes on|pg||
nt|roswolf: frying pan into fire|pg||
nt|panja: unlikey here though, EW don't seem to have any interesting option for discarding differently..|pg||
nt|panja: W will sluff @H, E will sluff @H|pg||
nt|rmb1: Might try a @H now|pg||
nt|panja: try and slip @H trick through East?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: well it can be if you agree it is|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: what?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 card fit now|pg||
nt|hedyg: are we watching the right board?|pg||
nt|glen: now there are fires, and there is this|pg||
nt|roswolf: this would be funny a5-0 fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: would be?|pg||
nt|roswolf: you shouldnt laugh at a funeral|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok folks! see? it can happen to anybody!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if duboin had not rdbl'd it would have benn just ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: next time i play in my cuebid i must try to remember this moment|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italian will be x -rated in the post mortem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like hand from the menagerie where both sides can play 2@dX|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: low trump to start|pg||
nt|granguru:  diagnostic?|pg||
nt|glen: the best thing for NS to do after the hand is leave table, then come back when decibel level is below 120|pg||
nt|hedyg: call an ambulance|pg||
nt|granguru:  --4?|pg||
nt|roswolf: gib says -7 dd|pg||
nt|granguru:  ducking is best here|pg||
nt|hedyg: desperately looking for an entry to his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if slam is on for n/s i still tale the penalty 1700|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice switch!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: take|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: it is only when Madala doubles that he is better than invite|pg||
nt|3for3: a little chancy for cullin to double.  is meck is 0-2 in the blacks, might be cold, or his side could be making.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: just dont play @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@H was discouraging|pg||
nt|hedyg: in this situation it just denies the ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: seemed easier to disc 10@D|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: if the 3@D bid had been gf, then it would have been a forcing pass|pg||
nt|athene: it's reasonable enough to play pass forcing if you showed at least game invite values and opps go to 5-level; 99% of the time they are advance saccing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Flanc paysan - et correct(e)|pg||

nt|3for3: as long as rodwell didnt play @D all ok.  He had no reason to against 5@S undoubled.  If Meck had doubled, might have been looking for extra 200 point undertricks.  here the goal ...|pg||
nt|3for3: was a modest +50|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hard to play at Meckwell speed, they are at least 2 boards ahead|pg||

nt|andyv:  5-5 hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: lots of hcp but not much chance of a slam|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: if west just holds up his @SA isn't he beating 5@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is, needs to hold up twice|pg||
nt|athene: he ducks twice - now if bocchi plays another trump he takes the ace and plays a fourth and the club ruff goes|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called , Ginossar think 5s was -1 |pg||
nt|athene: if bocchi ruffs a club himself, then west can simply force the south hand in clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: Tadeusz, did Gino duck the A@S?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe bocchi claimed 11 or something and west agreed without really thinking it through|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely though|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but fatigue does play its part|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that unlikely, only 4-0 @ss could beat him|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might well have played a @s from hand and claimed|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: Well i haven't seen , Bocchi has just claimed|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so we will wait, once declarer claims all play stops and you call the TD if you dont agree|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: We are waiting for decision |pg||

nt|jcomyn: 2nt-3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a horrible 1nt|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcomyn: might try 3nt here a behind bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be from the same family|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = 8-10 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do they treat a 25+ hand, Walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = waiting|pg||
nt|ady: slam zone for e/w|pg||
nt|fokal: 1@s or 2 @h ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may not be so easy to stay low enough - that 1@s might turn out to waste space rather than save it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 1@D for me too|pg||
nt|3for3: it often does|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it seems that West can use relays of some kind, rather than have the auction start 1@s-2@h-3@d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ew just need to bid the slam. the hand plays itself then|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks normal to get to 4@S - a bit tin for slam, although you might well make 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: living thru this at the table is bad, but worse will come during scoring when you say minus 1400 |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt much superior|pg||

pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: lots of controls in n hand why not 2nt|pg||
nt|dburn: but an initial 1@d would not have shown diamonds, and if East can show what he has by responding to relays, 1@s may lead to an easier auction all round|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c relay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H = 4@C|pg||
pc|h7|nt|twcho: and 2D=bal, 8-10?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|woozle: Pepsi chooses to go quietly with his 17-count, fearing that a double will be pulled too often|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice judgment here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well it must be makable since NS took 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is dangerous|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it looks dangerous, but they probably have it under control|pg||
nt|3for3: this is one of the things that makes bridge hard to 'sell' to the general public.|pg||
nt|panja: ok to upgrade a point...even if your range is 20-21|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok maximum then|pg||
nt|ady: would need to avoid a spade loser as well as K@C onside   so slam poor|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: e/w will need a lot of the captain's coffee at the end of this match she wont be very sympathetic|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think W may be squeezed on the reds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right|pg||
nt|fokal: aurait pu aussi faire un cue bid, garantissant 4 (voire 5) @c ; mais avec un 4333, il a préféré orienter son jeu vers les SA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: "please continue to play, i will give you my decision"|pg||
nt|3for3: Even expert commentators have no clue what is happening|pg||
nt|panja: but I don't quite like the 2Nt opening itself.........it is an 'offside' opening, to borrow a term from football, too far too soon, a self-preemptive...|pg||
nt|kit: so after all that, they will get to 6NT like everybody else|pg||
nt|bobholl: i even thougth 8-13 bal but not sure|pg||
nt|ritong: et ne touche pas genre @h Dx ou Jx(x) qui lauraut bien arrangé|pg||

pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  Tres proche Ã¡ gÃ©nial - et rien perdu|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|woozle: If the match were closer, he probably would have acted|pg||
nt|blum1956: This is a partscore board besides McGann has another opinion))|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS play negative frre bids (NFB) after intervention, so S has extras and N accepts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree but prefer playing from n|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@C showing short?|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about @H?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but today the boards seem to fvor the overbidders. there were 2 slam hands first segment where you could bid the grand to it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: i am sure there is no bid to show both singletons|pg||
nt|dburn: I expect that by now West knows what East has|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@C was probably 5161 with a stiff DUECE of hearts :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: If 4@D is purely choise of games then East must bid 4@H,  If 4@D has slam try overtones surely East must bid on with a fit for both suits|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D onlly 8-10|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|ritong: oui, comme olivier je parle anglais:) traduisez Jx(x) par Vx(x)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|granguru:  Duboin should have passed 1@H doubled but I give sementa the greatest part of guilt.for not passing 2@C.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Swedish experts think he showed exact pattern, thus wasted hcps in W hand|pg||
nt|dburn: people don't spend months and years devising these methods just to make life difficult for the commentators|pg||
nt|dburn: they do it because it helps them reach more right contracts than wrong ones|pg||
nt|bigtrain: re: 25...  if partner bids negative 1@D they use 2@H as a kokish relay|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jfaria:  but that would require a perfect dd play by N I think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: h lead from w would n ot be nice|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lot of messages from specs about the last board|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree with that 1@HX probably not too bad|pg||
nt|granguru:  although 2@C is probably -4 |pg||
nt|glen: would make a fun "you be the judge" in the "the bridge world"|pg||
nt|leao:  oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: suckered into it|pg||
nt|leao:  his main trick source has just sprung a leak|pg||
nt|bobholl: walter you play their system completely :)?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rcerreto: defense did his best to avoid a ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but the @s position left no chances to them|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Mais cÂ´est bon pour vous - les francais - de vous entrainer en anglais...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ntmon: sure, @H better for defence but again .. not easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is quite clear: if the A@S is ducked twice he cannot make 5@ss|pg||
nt|MolvaM: to just make it|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|granguru:  it will surely appear in some more years|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the whole enchilada|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: anyone know the ages of the dutch juniors|pg||
nt|bobholl: only @H now will result in loss for netherlands white|pg||
nt|leao:  does pard know about the @d?|pg||
nt|bobholl: can he read the @H 8 i doubt it and he doesn't know the @D situation|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: d and small c and pray|pg||
nt|ntmon: actually case is good after lead from @SA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: going to the wire|pg||
nt|granguru:  I will send the hand ..@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but might be censored as not beinf suitable for a family audience|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|leao:  or not :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: home now i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bet the score stands though - if the claim was accepted even though in error - thats it unless it was impossible to win the number of tricks claimed|pg||
nt|roswolf: which it clearly wasnt|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not so sure - declarer is meant to give a line of play|pg||
nt|granguru:  :$|pg||
nt|3for3: Mind you, I am not against science.  It just lessens the ability for the spectators to watch and enjoy|pg||
nt|hedyg: you mean they dont hate us???|pg||

nt|glen: at local club, N says "sorry partner, missed the slam"|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't discard a @d from dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mahaffey lead up to 8 over Texan Aces   and we're down to a mere 1|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: yes, S didn't dicard @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: he went to his hand while ruffing a @d then played trump to squeeze E with @h and K@s|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/osfrunda1.html|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yorkbeach:  in a Mollo book, East would put his @sQ in with his @c and let declarer see his hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: @D10 normal   including top of interior    other spot leads  2nd/4th|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Le palier de cinq appertient Ã¡...|pg||
nt|rcerreto: the match is cooling down with a few part score deals|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have 1@HX at -2 and -3 and 2@c X is -3|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: thus it was a close call to pass 2@H, but that got +110|pg||
nt|hedyg: John surely 1@D X already meant that?|pg||
nt|panja: E hand was 20 points on this scale|pg||
nt|roswolf: 8 not played!?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: solid 2nt for m,e|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= 16+|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Lev and Pepsi reached the right contract with only one artificial bid, but the number of ways to skin a cat remains greater than one|pg||
nt|3for3: dbl=points, 5-8 or so.  not 'negative'|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: some will preemt with N hand|pg||
nt|athene: interesting - no Ghestem for this NS pair|pg||
nt|athene: but most italian pairs do play some sort of ghestem|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the E hand you bid X and pray pd doesnt bid 3@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well most of the time..could have been  a GOSH or a 2-suited hand also|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@S splinter|pg||
nt|panja: rather light double by West, helps them find a very good sac|pg||
nt|leao:  they didnt like board 8, i guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@h - 1@S - 2@H pass out?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: Now a notrump partscore, probably with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 4@H more normal although may double|pg||
nt|bobholl: everything goes on this vulnarabilty even 4@S and bad @H (their 2@D contains the better @H ?)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Probably best described as a Joey Silver hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: another "void hand"|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2@s was probably nonforcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s obviously nf|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D isn't multi it's precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy for Baldursson this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  19-6 & 17-8 dans les demi-finales serrÃ©es|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry Murat|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kamras really doesnt want to play in @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  more tempted to open N hand 1@c|pg||
nt|kit: nice decision to pass|pg||
nt|kit: opening lead not so nice though|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blum1956: the @h position is of that special sort so nothing may disturb this contract|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S possible with such a good suit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: action again|pg||
nt|3for3: Rodwell's 4@S a coincidence.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like 4 losers in 4@h|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT the game that makes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but 3nt super|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: and chosen|pg||
nt|hedyg: they do play Ghestem on their CC|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes partner has good diamonds and weak hearts and you can make 4@S but not 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: just maybe not with @cs|pg||
nt|athene: throwing hearts on diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  the spot cards are awful|pg||
nt|rmb1: Another double-digit swing to Mahaffey on 20, no club lead against 4@H +1 on a less revealing auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He also had the oprtion of overcalling 2NT, upgrading @HAQ10, but that is risky at these colours|pg||
nt|ritong: la vulnérabilité incite tom a proposer un sacrifice|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mais Papa Ã¡ Ã©tÃ© trop satisfait avec son levÃ©e dÂ´atout|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ou?|pg||
nt|ritong: en l'occurrence, il me semble qu'il serait légèrement bénéficiaire|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: what now - dicey|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this wont go for 1400 but in context a similar result|pg||
nt|granguru:  well -16 is not the worst we have seen|pg||
nt|hedyg: any reason his pd could not have 7 good @hs and void in @s?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4 baldy aces not your best holding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and note no other card higher than 7|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: no hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does have the good 7 card suit part|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4h was a bit exaggerated for my taste|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@h would be ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems to be -3|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe auctions|pg||
nt|leao:  are NS playing canapÃ©?|pg||
nt|roswolf: is this the right board?|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes they do |pg||
nt|bobholl: play canape|pg||
nt|leao:  ok, ty|pg||
nt|bigtrain: will the @S10 score?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: i am tols canape is dutch flavor of the month|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|jfaria:  lack of entries in E will give a chance to declarer?|pg||
nt|andyv:  good result achieved in the open room|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: 2@D = 4card drury i am told|pg||
nt|kit: no need to be aggresive -- just passive diamond lead for me|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ntmon: @S lead in OR, no  problem then|pg||
nt|panja: very interesting board 20|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: this should be -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot get to dummy and cannot ruff his @C losers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed thiks is a very nsty hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: lev has a nat @sJ lead|pg||
nt|ady: was predictable they would play 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: mais michel n'a pas un jeu a surenchérir|pg||
nt|ritong: il n a aucune chance de les faire, la pénalité sera sans doute au moins 300 et il peut arriver de bonnes choses a 4@s|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if he gets some help..|pg||
nt|bobholl: no they are the only top pair playing canape|pg||
nt|ady: need K@S witth north to establish a discard|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: this will drift down|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR in 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: 800 is not a scratch|pg||
nt|panja: meckwell didn't at all try to explore a slam....as a result...there was a choice or leads..and East chose the wrong one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: gone for the @cJ lead - mildly surprising|pg||
nt|MolvaM: could south be sqzd in the blacks?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  I would never let go a @d looking at that dummy...W is very brave|pg||
nt|jfaria:  needed a @c shift |pg||
nt|bigtrain: oops|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|panja: choice of leads even|pg||
nt|rcerreto: chances for an overtrick now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|leao:  nice guess|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: what with a good 6-carder|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this could recover some of the imps lost in the disaster|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rcerreto: has he any reason not to finesse in @h?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|roswolf: dummy is truly LE MORT|pg||
nt|hedyg: now +1|pg||
nt|hedyg: or 2?|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@c, @C ruff and 3 discards and claim|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mais ilo faut evaluer la chance, que N/S vont Ã¡ 5 @S, bien sur|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: and suddenly things change drastically|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gino must have thought his @ss were good enough to play even opposite shortness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with trump that good i definitely agree kit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: nice decision to pass as kit said will turn into "nightmare to pass"|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|jfaria:  easy for us to see|pg||

mb|p|nt|glen: some styles like a 3rd seat 1@H here|pg||
nt|ritong: i suspect our operator anticipated a little:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah ok, didnt pull 3rd|pg||
nt|jfaria:  cant see anyone opening this auction|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ntmon: new leader - i didn't tell that during last few boards|pg||
nt|hedyg: not when KJ are behind :p|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: yet another Major partscore hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this is what we were waiting for - a 6-6 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: west might try an aggressive 3@S now, thinking his @DKJx mesh nicely with his partner's diamond suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt by east|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: and here it rests!?|pg||
nt|leao:  it shud...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: in fact, of course, they mesh nicely with *north's* diamond suit|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 2@C then 2@S i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: the pitiful crutch of 4SF |pg||
nt|athene: show an invitational hand but stop at the 2 level|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and not 5 minutes after conceding 1400|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 37 minutes|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: very aggressive cuebid|pg||
nt|bigtrain: good that meck went low|pg||
nt|ady:  save in 6@D for n/s|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right. first non quiet board of the set|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Parfait - pour le flanc|pg||
nt|rcerreto: looks -1 on normal play|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: n/s will press on to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: an easy contract|pg||
nt|leao:  and did|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, ça ne va pas le faire pour le déclarant|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: last board of this match now and of the Swiss teams|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to our outstanding operator in Poznan, Tadeusz ! to my excellent fellow commentators Geoffrey, Danny and David for donating their time and expertise to guide us through ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: these boards.our appreciation to the EBL and the PBF for bringing this event to BBO, especially Slawek Latala  who was intrumental in organizing these broadcasts on behalf of BBO|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S bid....I don't really like it..|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@C stopper ask?|pg||
nt|panja: poor suit..poor shape....no need to bid in a live auction|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C are often missed if best fit :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this brings bridge into disrepute|pg||
nt|roswolf: a constructive auction to a 4-2 fit - save me please|pg||
nt|leao:  the @c community shud file a complaint|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S is cold|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s could be made|pg||
nt|woozle: with CA onside, diamond position, spade position and no diamond ruff coming|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@C may not be wise - who has the @S suit? probably partner, and is weak ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big finish for someone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it isnt lavazza|pg||
nt|ntmon: .. but this is not the case|pg||
nt|3for3: meck bought a nice hand from rodwell, who could have had nada.  K@D and stiff heart very useful|pg||
nt|roswolf: well imo east should rebid 1nt - to avoid this torture|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: Yes but has to get @Ds right|pg||
nt|hedyg: can not be more than invite by passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - this match (though entertaining) doesn't matter - but there are some fierce qualification battles going on in both A and B flights|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow morning with the Knockouts|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcomyn: frying pan into the toaster|pg||
nt|athene: nope, he tries 3 anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@C and @c switch might help|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that wont happen|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: east will accept!?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann tries 4H, down one or two on a spade guess with the club hook failing|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 2@s should be enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: everything is friendly|pg||
nt|granguru:  Italoswiss is a kib with very good memory|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now!|pg||
nt|hedyg: help the defense ofc|pg||
pc|h2|nt|woozle: down one...Fiona surely won't try the SK now|pg||
nt|blum1956: -50 against -140 or -170 is a useful 3 imps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ntmon: X should secure @C lead against 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 card out of 3 is on side|pg||
nt|rmb1: This club stop is not going to stand close inspection|pg||
nt|panja: luckily for NS..@HA is with E, and @DK, with West...|pg||
nt|panja: so there are 8 tricks..|pg||
nt|bobholl: jansma - paulissen bid 1@D 1@S 1NT much better but surely not best|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6 + more imps dribble away|pg||
nt|ady: n/s not saving may prove important in this match|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcomyn: craziest contract of the week|pg||
nt|roswolf: north needs to avoid being endplayed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think he can get endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: endplay is unlikely because after ruffing a club and drawing trumps, west has no trumps left so a fourth club is fine|pg||
nt|3for3: i believe the higher you are, you get bonus in KO's, re selection of opponents.  Hedy posted the rule earlier|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10:00 AM CET|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is for teams 1-8, the rest are seeding as per EBL or WBF seeding points|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ritong: je tends a penser que l autre salle entamera aussi autre chose que @c|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|roswolf: well strong club systems have their downsides too|pg||
nt|leao:  why not pass 2@c? play in the 4-4 fit instead of in the (putative) 5-2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: even A@H and @H is fine|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|woozle: I fear at this point that 3 isn't enough|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Avec le meme declarant, oui|pg||
nt|ritong: et dans ce cas, @s DVx a une bonne tête|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ntmon: prediction? abstain..|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed as it happens but still care needs to be taken|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: hope no children are watching|pg||
nt|granguru:  some time ago I said whenever one player of each team tries to play the same suit, one of them is out of his mind. I was referring myself to the play of the cards thou|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|leao:  unless 2@c is forcing for them|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d6|nt|bobholl: @D will take care of @C loser so 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rcerreto: sorry, I didn't see well|pg||
nt|rcerreto: N can't play @d to cut dummy away|pg||
nt|rcerreto: given the @d position|pg||
mc|8|nt|panja: @CT on trick two was a smart play.. allowing a late entry to W hand with 4th Club..if needed|pg||
nt|rcerreto: my mistake (once again)|pg||
nt|pelu: no but if N play @DQ then decl can Take @DA and @hQ and hope that no @s-loaser when N ruff|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes, would have given a loosing option|pg||
nt|ralfwil: very close now|pg||

nt|jcomyn: yes 1s by e|pg||
nt|andyv:  is that where the last 4 cards in dummy are the same denomination?|pg||
nt|andyv:  all Qs or Js, etc?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no close|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence needed to play trumps at some point|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tout normale|pg||
nt|pelu: against 4@C in b22 East found the killing lead (killing for defense) a @C and killeds partners Jxxx|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: at this vulnerability you always feel that you've done your job in making them play at the 5-level |pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: still no|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is not clear why you shouldnt bid this slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and Baldursson led SQ, so dont know what happened after that|pg||
nt|bobholl: whow can they reach 7|pg||
mb|r|nt|rmb1: On  21, NS ran from 3NTX ... to 4NT-2 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = limit raise or better|pg||
nt|kit: this is east grand to bid|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: easy|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have 5@C  or 3NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: where there is a void, there is action|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anyone more than me with 2@h from W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: should be duck soup even with a 11-13 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: we should offer a prize for the right answer|pg||
nt|bobholl: because you also miss the @H it is not too good :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 10 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D is artificial game try|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell can just about bid it on his own|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@s avec du gaz|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mais cela pousse Nord Ã¡ 4 @H|pg||
nt|ritong: ou pas|pg||
nt|ritong: il n a rien:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rmb1: In OR, EW did not bid 6@H on  22 but managed one more trick 4@H+3|pg||
nt|roswolf: west passed in the other room|pg||
nt|bobholl: not playing 11-13 nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think this is playable - no system can recognise useful 10's|pg||
nt|bobholl: in west 6@H is luckier no @D lead and it is a vedry good slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: very|pg||
nt|leao:  cards are laying VERY well for declarer|pg||
nt|rcerreto: count me on|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobholl: lack wood|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C is exclusion|pg||
nt|kit: exclusion I guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: 3@S probably shows 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: here's a hint. Think in terms of a slot machine|pg||
nt|ady: as kib pointed out  6@C down on diamond lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: last chance to stop|pg||
nt|ady: not that easy even without the diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: now that';s a good slam :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: I APPROVE OF THIS BIDDING -BID WHAT YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE:)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1 key|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would sementa lightner?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hm...|pg||
mb|p|nt|leao:  yes, as 6NT wud be, but agree on the bidding tip|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rcerreto: I like the Bessis's style to get in frequently but still being able to stop|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: given the state of the match will they try for the @C slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1600 in one room is amazing at this hour. Europe working, most of USA sleepingh|pg||
nt|kit: 2 ruffs in dummy for 7 hearts, 2 spades, 4 diamonds = 13|pg||
nt|ady: sorry meant 5@C down on diamond lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  9 tricks easy now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i should be sleeping :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: which would certainly have faILED|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rcerreto: many pairs just push the pedal up to a crash|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|panja: y.|pg||
nt|panja: better play might have been to win @CK and cash a trump...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|panja: now @ST9 are finessable..but entries are short..|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: et de plus, son partenaire n a pas eu les moyens de contrer 1@s en soutien|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sur 1 @S, Sud montre, qÂ´il nÂ´a pas la main pour soutenir les @H du Nord. Pour moi: 3 @H sur 3 @D est obligatoire|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have a feeling that this match will go to extra time. If so, they are going to play 4 additional boards, then perhaps another 4 and so on, until a winner is found|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|panja: so S will make only 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: useful trump jack|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: This is only good for India, Australia and night owls|pg||
pc|cK|nt|leao:  very|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: specs tell me: prev board 6d down 3 on the @CA lead and spade switch |pg||
nt|ady: may have needed to finesse 6@H 2nd round   could be a trick short now|pg||
nt|ady: diamond discard not good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs to draw the @CK, though - entries are a problem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the first 4 tricks were fast |pg||
nt|ritong: quoi?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: another 2 imps to Mahaffey|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pelu: 94-94 before last board NL - Croniere|pg||
nt|rcerreto: fine with us but I think the players aren't hoping for that|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: draw some trumps and lead a small heart for the top prize|pg||

pc|dA|nt|rcerreto: that meant a 7 imps double score to Bessis|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: give em their 2 aces and claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  it may well be that EW weren't on same page|pg||
nt|leao:  5@h asks for trump queen, no?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but they migth bid 7@D too (hope so as a dutchman)|pg||
nt|leao:  lol|pg||
nt|leao:  they are certainly trying|pg||
nt|leao:  mite have bid 6 a long time ago|pg||
nt|leao:  7 went -2|pg||
nt|roswolf: he cant count a sure 13 tricks therefore the small slam is sensible|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Au secours|pg||
pc|h7|nt|leao:  this has a chance|pg||
nt|roswolf: he might also be considering the strain ie NT OR@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: NO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE|pg||
nt|roswolf: A DBL IS LIKELY|pg||
nt|leao:  on the other table the @c view was taken, but declarer run into a @c ruff |pg||
nt|roswolf: as you would|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: and they will get a non-vul game equivalent score for the passes here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will take a long time to play|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D lead best |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|leao:  this requires the @c play and a @s unblock b4 running the @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: if the club view is found there are 12 top tricks and north will be squeezed in the majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes difficult but finable i think|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he did|pg||
nt|ady: this could be the winning board for Mahaffey|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E is squeezes for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: last bord in semi in Women : NL bid a 5@D: need @cKJx in front of AQ10 xx - with 7 @Cs out - make - and in the final|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|rmb1: Now set up @S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: findable|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: information www.poznan2011.pl|pg||
nt|glen: questions on 3@H, likely 4@Hs and a minimum|pg||
nt|glen: the idea is that while 3@H may be too high, it is a 5-4+ fit, and prevents @S from getting into the auction|pg||
nt|glen: stronger super accepts would make another bid than 2@H or 3@H|pg||
nt|glen: specs note with KT93 of @S, perhaps you would like opps to bid|pg||
nt|glen: other specs blame Larry Cohen for the LAW|pg||
nt|glen: LAW defenders note that 3@D makes|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: Mr Bompis is still thinking :)|pg||

nt|andyv:  so 4@c was either a splinter, in which case 4N doesn't make sense or 4@c was RKC in which case 4N doesn't make any sense|pg||
nt|panja: I have to leave now, thx Robin, all|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@S looks worth trying|pg||
nt|panja: bye|pg||

nt|leao:  :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: an old vienna:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: certains jouent que déclarer le contrat " forcé" montre un jeu minimum|pg||

mb|1C|nt|jfaria:  test|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  but at the end, no harm done|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will play 3NT|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|rmb1: 2NT good raise|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fokal: a safe and sound 3 @d|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: indeed but u are right. a kind of lemming sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1:  23 saw NS play 5@H+1 in OR for another 10IMP to Mahaffey|pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy raise to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: daddy is preempting ;)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I think that E devaluated his hand and chose not to open 1NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: this is a little unlucky but the vul game bonus tempts everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: east has a difficult lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ugly hand for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 SA sur 2 @C - pas dÂ´option?|pg||
nt|ritong: pour ma part, je passe quand je n ai rien à dire, je suppose que c est ça que tu définis comme "logique", hans|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@H in OR|pg||
nt|rcerreto: N liked better an offbeat 1@d than a thin 1NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: club lead     should make 9 tricks easily|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play on hearts   and make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: EW believed 4@S making :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N a bit worried about the small @c doubleton|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jfaria:  but nothing he could bid besides 3nt|pg||
pc|d9|nt|woozle: McGann takes a wild swing at game, which should make on the favourable heart lie, even if she runs into a club ruff|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they won't reach 4@H they are "stupid" but wise|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: well s has an 18-19 nt so|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|woozle: did she really duck the diamond?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: nice lead|pg||
nt|kit: might make|pg||
nt|rcerreto: sorry, W devaluated|pg||
nt|fokal: so Bessis will have a 10 imp lead before the last boar|pg||
nt|fokal: d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bigtrain: not now|pg||
nt|kit: very nice lead|pg||
nt|ady: play east for either queen or jack of hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|roswolf: on bd 12 the field bid to 6nt|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: has good intermediates|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: are we still live|pg||
nt|ady: Lavazza will need a swing on hand 25 to have a chance|pg||
nt|rcerreto: after devaluating, he felt compelled to raise @h to 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 4@h from W? 3 is enough and it´s up to E to decide game or not|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: guess n will also go 1 down|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcomyn: that reminds me of a hand in istanbul when my p put me into 4s and i ran into a 5-0 break. He said he was worried about clubs. I had the AKQJ and won none of em|pg||
nt|bobholl: it took a long time so migth put up K :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: specs saying the contrary but i guess he'll put up k anyway :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  so he was right to be worried:)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: which isn't very consequential but... he's playing there while I'm sitting at home|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|woozle: she must be getting tired|pg||

nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Bob and Leao for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Tadeusz, great operating!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our commentators, Kit, Walter and Bob|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the set|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ady: thx all   interesting set|pg||
nt|fokal: oh une donne mouvementée|pg||
nt|fokal: yes . But this 1@h bid with a 4 count , 5 small @h balanced hand no aces, no kings, .....|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  North has had a couple of hands where he's been blessed with great spot cards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee that match ended very tamely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  last board no expected swings, cmon orange jrs lets make a fight of it :) only 1o imps behind against mighty Meckwell|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of 3N contracts|pg||
nt|fokal: EW devraient faire 4 @h|pg||
nt|fokal: doesn't seem textbook :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: they're going a little wild|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s looks like @s and a minor|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jfaria:  dont go away 2d half promises |pg||
nt|jcomyn: they have done well|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the last board, thanks to Panja for commentating, thanks to the operator, and to EBL and BBO for organising|pg||
nt|rmb1: and thanks to Dutch kibs for support|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 2 decisive boards will show|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 25 and 26|pg||
nt|fokal: mais après cette enchère NS devraient défendre à 5 @c|pg||
nt|fokal: reste à savoir ce qu'il se passera au palier de 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: thomas devrait dire 4@c|pg||
nt|rcerreto: also 2@s here isn't exactly in Allavena's usual style|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2nd half in 1 hour and 5 minutes, 12.30 local time|pg||
nt|bobholl: is this forcing for them walter ? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can 3@H be forcing in any system?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4s good?|pg||
nt|ritong: tom va montrer ses @cs d une maniere ou d une autre, et ça va plaire a son partenaire|pg||
nt|fokal: 4 @d bonne enchère, pour faire juger le partenaire au palier de 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ok folks thans to the kibs and to a great operator|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nice pressure 4@S opening|pg||
nt|rmb1: East send it back? (XX)|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w have no slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
nt|pelu: D is ok - but I cant se where W found values for the 4.@H - he know 2 @D losers - and no game if partner cant bid 4@h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: guessed so but you never can tell :)|pg||
nt|ady: 1 too high unless defence slips|pg||
nt|rcerreto: maybe he felt behind in the match|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: so a pretty emphatic victory for Mahaffey|pg||
nt|jcomyn: have to go and play golf now - tough life|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt was the popular contract at the other tables|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a phyrrus victory in 4@s:(|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: 5@C needs a diamond duck to win|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hard to stop at 4s with only 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|ady: Lavazza had a chance to double 4@H|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5d -1 if declarer finesses the @d|pg||

nt|fokal: bon|pg||
nt|fokal: on dirait que les trois petits carreaux ne l'ont pas refroidi|pg||
nt|hawe45:  EEntame|pg||
nt|fokal: du point de vue se Sud il sait qu'il ne chute pas beaucoup au palier de 6|pg||
nt|fokal: mais vu que son partenaire ne l'a pas soutenu a @s , il se doute que AR de pique passent|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cute - 5 @C pourrait etre sur table|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Chute|pg||
nt|fokal: N can beat this by playing @h any time he can|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: all calm here but the dutch will gain a few|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 10 tricks in spades   not easy 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|pelu: 1 trick in all 4 suit from start|pg||
nt|fokal: oops sry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for -2 - yes. always one loser in each suit|pg||
nt|fokal: it's to make down 2|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably 2way new minor|pg||
nt|jfaria:  with 2 aces missing hard to make more than 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jfaria:  tuff lead |pg||
nt|ritong: en meme temps, il a un vague espoir de les faire si ils se trompent d entame|pg||
nt|fokal: mais il n'en sait rien pour la 3e levée; le 4 @d adverse est inquiétant, avec ses deux petits @d|pg||
