nt|psyck: *to show @cK...|pg||
nt|jbgood: he should have bid 6@s - unless they have obscure agreements|pg||

nt|jcomyn: oh well two standard games and a bif 11 imps swin. 4h here easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that got what it deserved lucky not to be doubled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nasty class of a deal|pg||
nt|jfaria:  anyway, Balicki couldnt know about @d duplication so a normal game on the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: another 1@C|pg||
mb|1C|nt|oosmanb: Hi John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and another one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another slam here|pg||

nt|jcomyn: precision no doubt|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: hi mike|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@D < 18 natural I'm told|pg||
nt|mamos: yep John we are back in The jungle with Tarzan Precision|pg||
nt|jcomyn: part score in d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jfaria:  S was likely to try a red...he choosed the worst|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he sure did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i would always bid 2d|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Mustve shown @H :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jr7: an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: end played at trick one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: very good way of playing right way up|pg||
nt|oosmanb: probably 5-5 reds|pg||
nt|jcomyn: havent seen too many of your lot playing precision mike|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway I'm sujre yolu have an amusing explanation of Tarzan Precision|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'd give open @D and hope for A@S on or @H 3-2|pg||
nt|mamos: played by Wijs Muller |pg||
nt|jr7: Small communikationproblems|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: fair 6@S but not easy to bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jfaria:  3nt plyed by South looked fine|pg||
nt|jr7: and @D|pg||
nt|jfaria:  its human to try @h , there was still a small chance of a vuln game in a major...|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Not clear for E he shape of his partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Live standings and scores here: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|jfaria:  K @h may be a waste|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|jcomyn: knew it.. lol|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Helle has overtook Mahaffey as of now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe human but not practical|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  they wont stop now|pg||
nt|peachy: Common 2/1 style is to rebid 1NT as West, because in 2/1, 1D is either weak with no major, or GF in which case East will bid spades next|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: or use NMF|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jfaria:  if def failed to discover @s I mean|pg||
nt|peachy: 1S could also show an unbalanced hand which West does not have this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: has e done enough ? 3 aces :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Both have slight extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  dont think the HH will miss this one|pg||
nt|bobholl: they did :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  they did |pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: I'm thinking East with 7 controls could have tried once more|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jfaria:  anyway 10 tricks is not an easy task|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jfaria:  HH bid and made a very nice grand that Meckwell among others missed in the RR |pg||
pc|sK|nt|oosmanb: This is scary now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oosmanb: wouldve been so much easier if West had taken his King!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes and switch s|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but declarer didnt need ruffing finesse|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: no way back for declarer I fear|pg||
nt|oosmanb: just ruff 7@D then draw trumps and concede open @D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: make over trick if A@S on|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|psyck: they may be going via some (non)seriousNT sequence other room|pg||
nt|psyck: Souths hand not improved by this bidding|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|psyck: but looks like he does well to make a forwards move as cards are here|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|jbgood: 4 @c looks as a next-to-last train:)|pg||
nt|psyck: wow, i really wouldn't have expected then to bid this one|pg||
nt|psyck: lol Jon|pg||
nt|xenya: an excellent 6@H by N here|pg||
nt|jbgood: odd   of key cards with 5 NT and a void|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|jbgood: 7 makes of course |pg||
mb|6H|nt|xenya: not bad bt S either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: lucky luke may shoot it|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some play 5N as even with void & 6x as odd with void, guess they reverse it here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: most play it as an odd number 5 is an odd number - easy to remember:)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, decent enuf even by S as has chances after @c lead to|pg||

nt|jbgood: no - in 6 you try to make 6|pg||
nt|jbgood: in 7 you would bet on a loose @d king|pg||
nt|psyck: kibs want W to lead his 'singleton' @dT :)|pg||
nt|xenya: in 7, W can insert the @DK on a small @D from S |pg||
nt|jbgood: you do that when you are in the zone - 2 possible slam swings away doesnt make you feel you can walk on water|pg||
nt|jbgood: even though he can:)|pg||

nt|oosmanb: This is very tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: how many teams from each group|pg||
nt|mamos: 3 to A and rest to B|pg||
nt|mamos: then 27 from A and 5 from B|pg||
nt|jr7: as the book said :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but n might think s has|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but S bid his @d not so easy now..|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H done enough|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Nice people - why to h... tell South, where the @C King is!!!???|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: to make up 32 KO|pg||
nt|oosmanb: that happened?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: dead now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So-called service-double|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Overtrick now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Not so tricky now|pg||
nt|jfaria:  no way to get @d out|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bidding a 2nd suit can be dangerous as it can be misleading|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: count to 9 is a good idea|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4c surely better pinpointing absence of d control|pg||
nt|jfaria:  this looks like "systematic" but 4@d looks quite a mistery to me|pg||
nt|bobholl: scared them out of a making 6@H|pg||
nt|jfaria:  cant say i agree wih xin a slam auction... statiscs say they help declarer more than defence|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jfaria:  worked well here though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Exactly|pg||
nt|peachy: NS I think didnt get the spade void located|pg||
nt|peachy: had they been able to get that in the picture, surely they go on|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: apart from s trying to tell p he has 5-card d|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: in any case i dont care for that 2nt bid why not 1s and take it easy. everybody in such a rush this week|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Listen: Over 4 @C and NO double, South would bid 4 @H - ENDING THE AUCTION|pg||
nt|peachy: which makes me think a direct splinter (if available) could have worked better than 3H|pg||

nt|peachy: it is not a great slam|pg||

nt|mcsd: Hello Joao |pg||
nt|oosb: 4 top losers here|pg||
nt|oosb: and at the vulnerabilitiy I dont think any South will venture 5@D as a semi-save|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mcsd: but will make 6@c or 6@d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: solid 3nt|pg||
nt|mamos: NS need to settle in 3NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcsd: S doesnt realise how stronh is his hand, so passes|pg||
nt|jfaria:  W is antecipating a storng balance and tells his story |pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  time to bid 6?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good slam here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - well paid, but the first was more impressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: South does well to bid again|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: I mean North|pg||
nt|jr7: this 4@S cant they play down - I think :)|pg||

nt|jfaria:  3 loosers, home|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|mcsd: i would consider opening of 2@C as north :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this CANT go down - famous last words|pg||
nt|jr7: from start 1 down - but the lead can maybee give him a possibillety|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jfaria:  or just 2 with @h discard|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Would have been better|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mcsd: and you ask me about 5 :):)|pg||
nt|oosb: I think its very aggressive, at the vulnerabililty|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|oosmanb: overtricks now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats why such a good idea to pre-empth only when u have nothing outside|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jr7: 2@D is "reverse" in DK - color + ekstra HP|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All Balicki chanced, was @C King by a man having bid 1 NT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oosmanb: Guys is everyone leading Q@C/J@C?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me one|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|mcsd: it is nothing wrong in the auction, but it is not my style.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jfaria:  maybe , plying MP Ivanov could delay his decision about what game to play...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Dangerous for South NOT to unblock the @S Jack|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|jcomyn: although tempting to lead a s|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: see the still got it wrong|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: they play modern!!|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|psyck: EW not the pair you would expect to use advanced gadgets :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: I would never have believed that - but my glasses dont fail me|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jbgood: no - they have tended to play very conservative methods|pg||

nt|fabsayc: defense with knowledge of 4333 should continue club when diamond ducked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but they did not :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ALOT of tables opened 3NT as East|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wouldn't matter would it?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  last hand now|pg||
nt|bobholl: tya cu later|pg||
nt|peachy: ty Bob|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: last bd will probably be flat|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand in the match now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in fact he should have returned spade trick 2, then declarer has no chance|pg||
nt|mamos: Oosman makes an interesting point    -- but against gambling 3NT defence needs to win tricks quickly   or contract will make  almost certainly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not to mention right-siding it|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcomyn: 9+9 = game??|pg||
mb|1H|nt|oosmanb: Infact 17 tables had Q@C led against 3NT from East (so far)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@h as a second choice?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jfaria:  must be @h|pg||
nt|mcsd: so the 4@H goes down 2, nowhere to discard anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  now a cue from W asking 4 a @h stopper|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and 13 led 4th highest @C !|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well that i will never lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Which also means that 30 tables opened 3NT as EAST!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-switch recommanded against 5 @D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mcsd: e-w may get too high on this hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you to all commentators for volunteering their time an expertise.  Thank you Marek for a great job as operator. Also thanks to EBL and the organizers for bringing these ...|pg||
nt|peachy: exciting matches to BBO.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mcsd: sorry -1, i counted @H for 2 loosers|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think chineese team has mostly to complain about wrong choices... Sementa & Duboin colected|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: more like a poker classic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H fast work|pg||
nt|peachy: And finally, many thanks to all our kibitzers, hope you enjoyed the show!|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mcsd: there is a possibility of makinh 6@D|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: wonder what happens if he does not have h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: easdt|pg||
nt|jfaria:  24 imps in 2 very hugly slams is too much in a short match|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: On a low club, anyone make?  Could declarer reason: "they always lead aces against gambling 3NT, so he doesn't have @CA, so I play low from dummy"?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: most interesting though, is that 3-4 declarers played 10@c on small @C lead!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: that's some read.!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  strange, was expecting last round to be reversed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jfaria:  meaning 3@s from W and 3nt by E|pg||
nt|peachy: Leaderboard after first Awiss match round, will be updated after all Round 2 matches finished             http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|jfaria:  but maybe 3@s would accept @h ...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lot of work|pg||
nt|peachy: *Swiss|pg||
nt|jfaria:  somehow Zack must find out the number of blacks of Balicki|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think that a shift cant hurt|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|peachy: Leaderboard is actually updated as board results come in so it should also be current for now, sorry|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: ropey 3nt i suppose|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: 10 is clear imo....  generally speaking an ace is lead if held vs gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah, answers my question - but it has a lot of logic in a top-class field|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mcsd: good play ny ivanov|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3nt +3 is worth a fortune!|pg||
nt|mcsd: and atop so far|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphpl1: thanks|pg||
