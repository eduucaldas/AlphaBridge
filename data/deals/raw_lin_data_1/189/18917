nt|pelu: here I prefer "Nt as transfer to @D (and 2@S for @C)|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: expect 2NT to be @D transfer, and 3@C = likes @Ds|pg||
mb|3H|an|.|nt|pelu: so 3@H = singleton|pg||

nt|pelu: not easy when two players from so dif nations and diff style play together|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Gerben42:  welcome back in Poznan|pg||
nt|davpro: Morning all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes   h   missing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult grand to bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems bochi plays in both rooms :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|hawe45:  A splinter in North would do fine - in later defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|davpro: Thx operator. It looked like an forcing pass-opening :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|davpro: Who is Brogeland playing with?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty operator|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|davpro: Ah- there the name came|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hawe45:  You have seen too manu bad overcalls, when you sell out with the North hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: missing the @DQ they have to diagnose they have extra trump length to compensate|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  south hand is known as Bridge World Death Hand (BWDH)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  invitational values with 3-card support for partner|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a nice hand with spade values and N has an easy raise to game with 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has built a trap - will remove to 5 @H, only losing 100 I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is there a reward for "slowest bid hand of the tournament" - without special reason...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello all|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Gerben42:  with Qxxxx x Axxx xxx North would pass and 4@S would be cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|7D|nt|Gerben42:  but there is normally no perfect answer|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 10 tricks are on ice here|pg||
nt|roswolf: players names will be up in a mo|pg||
nt|jbgood: going through the motions|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 controls and west will ask for the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: looks dangerous -all tricks possible|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed 4@s and E might have shown 4@h. I don't know their system :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: didnt bother played his pard for 3+ diamonds or the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D may yhave promised 3+diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|nt|MolvaM: who can hold Qxx diamonds? thats the question|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: only problem is the potential 3-0 trump break|pg||
nt|roswolf: doesnt matter here:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does the lead tell any story|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|jbgood: puppet i think - then 3@d shows 1 or 2 4 card majors, and deny 5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  13 tricks - over|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  or 12|pg||
mc|13|nt|bagman: One of the answers is to use an artificial tool to separate hands with 3 card spades and those with 0-2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 6 is down with @H lead|pg||
nt|davpro: y- that was my guess too|pg||

mb|p|nt|glen: here the 3@h and then 4@S indicates a stonger idea|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|glen: but hard for N to find the perfect cards in the S hand for slam|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|roswolf: 10 or 11 tricks operator?|pg||
nt|davpro: there was actually 12 to take (double dummie)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: solid start for the dutch|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: 10 point all around. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Peter and Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with 6/5 and only 1 defencive trick normally better to play in attack|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|runnerup: perhaps east should take it away -he has got support in hearts so ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: Angelini seems to be in the A Swiss almost no matter what happens in this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand for n/s to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: y and Mossop will need a good result to joij them|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|davpro: *join|pg||
nt|jbgood: 24 vps to Mossop |pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 from each group to A - the others to B|pg||
nt|pelu: hard decision by S - 4@H is down 1 and 5@c also down 1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c looks good|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 5@c making - only defense is @H lead and the @S - kill the entry for the 4. @D|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hawe45:  About 12 tricks again - but lucky and only in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jxxx in @D are very much - the double by Versace means balanced hand value in @S - Zaleski can reopen|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: kibs rush in to tell me that if defence plays spades 5c cant make|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: then 27 from A and 5 from B go on to the KO stage|pg||
nt|davpro: They found a 6-1 fit instead of the 6-0 fit. On level higher though|pg||
nt|pelu: has to take 3x@C befor @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: the non-vul Townsend might venture an insurance 4@Hs |pg||
nt|jbgood: but I think a black suit or even NT play better than @ds|pg||
nt|davpro: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: some sort of short suit trial bid?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|MolvaM: we see all 4 hands but sometimes at the table it is not obvious to shift to spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 2@C forcing one round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best lead: @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - NORTH is declarer... - wake up|pg||
nt|pelu: yes defense has to kill @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south wont get in much to lead trumps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would also make on the @S-lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead small @S possible but @H equivalent - many use to overcall 1@S in West to give the lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with weak 5332 i agree to pass like Versace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But an overcall would put the contract in South, so...|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing really helps,but contracts should have been by south this time -by n= -if spade lead,but now 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the option between @H and @S lead is a typical problem in bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Now defence need to get active |pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4s has good chances|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
pc|s5|nt|MolvaM: with trump Kx inside and clubs 3-3 and the @dK safe|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: and wont necessarily lead one anyway:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - wrong table:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe 2 |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|eamongall: still time |pg||
nt|bagman: N has to duck the @HK if W plays a low heart|pg||
nt|bagman: Both N and S know that there are no spade tricks to make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even in the case of a spade shift, stuurman has to be very careful to keep all his diamonds and let his spade honor go|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: i prefere to lead in the suit more solid, but without a solid suit i prefere the lead from small cards - but is is only a opinion|pg||
nt|jbgood: NT is more flexible than 3@d|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bagman: They also see the clubs so they can make extra tricks only from trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|jbgood: an imaginative E might bid 3@c then:)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|eamongall: At another table McGann Brown have reached the happy position of having 3 vulnerable doubled undertricks available against 4@S ...they still have to collect them |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi john|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi john|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42:  going plus got to be worth something|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so far +100 is almost worth everything|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if Madala is N then S is Rimstedt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  operator please correct S name?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|nt|glen: in the other room EW made six bids without @S, but then accidently bid the suit to play there|pg||
mb|4S|nt|glen: the 4@S bid here will be enough to get to slam now|pg||
nt|glen: even though EW are just temporary italians, they will use roman keycard blackwood|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure ita not easy to find out that the hands fit so well|pg||
nt|glen: Q. what is 2NT, A. unknown to us, but likely forcing game try, that in this case is a slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|tsadek: 2NT want to know 2@S with 3card or 4card|pg||

nt|tsadek: 4@S max 4card @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: wow|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|jbgood: looks like a peaceful 3 NT by N|pg||
nt|jbgood: or S for that matter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tokay-baldursson at the open room is a very new partnership which might explain why they couldnt find the grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|runnerup: normal 4 @h = with no other ideas -from anyone -looks like it ,but..|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|bagman: Rimsted clearly gambling with her heart suit|pg||
nt|davpro: yes. 9 easy tricks, but not the best communications...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 nt - 2 @h - 2 NT - 3 NT?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Gerben42:  some would call it practical :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all colors taked by weak players :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North bid both, @D and @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: misfit hand but contract seems makable|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible here perhaps|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|pelu: 2@S in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: the first non-alert after 3 rounds of bidding :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jbgood: N should know that the @c king counts for full - and bid 3 imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: They stopped low, but if @ds are not 3-3 a higher contract would be a struggle|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|roswolf: although the bidding thus far is cloaked in mystery they seem to be powering into it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  with a bit more fortune it would have been a claimer|pg||
nt|bagman: In pairs it might not be that practical as the bonus for the game is not that big as in teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: duck this @D could be a idea|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gives the same result, if South plays safe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but give at south the chance to fault|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S MIGHT BE FINIS|pg||
nt|roswolf: and it is not sure what happened there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at the other table, tokay asked for keycards and then asked for the trump queen apparently. why??|pg||

nt|hawe45:  A poor 4 @H - but you might be forced to "guess" right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East is evaluating what bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: this @d lead asked may help to get rid off spade looser|pg||
nt|jbgood: choice between dbl and 1 NT...|pg||
nt|jbgood: pass never an option for Boye on a near opener|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: east will leap high|pg||
nt|MolvaM: leader board and running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: but is it high enough|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: but defense may start with 3 spades and 5 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: not any more|pg||
nt|davpro: 8 quick tricks for defense here on a spade lead. 7 for declarer on that lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 7 th in the bag|pg||
mb|4H|nt|MolvaM: lets see if they can locate the missing @d control|pg||
nt|roswolf: they should do|pg||
nt|roswolf: the flexible double|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer needs to ruff the heart losers and discard a club on a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  UNDO|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade honors not so attractive for madala|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well be passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has nothing to cue and has soft club values|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p!|nt|roswolf: they dont have a lot of hcp to spare|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR NS in 6@H - looks like S gave a false cue bid in @D - but it was an artifical bidding over 6 round|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow thats enterprising|pg||
mb|6H|nt|MolvaM: in another table north could go with J2N and that might be a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i am told they are in slam in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he still likes his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: well even if diamonds are not led. no way to get rid of the 2 losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: and that is enough for norberto:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does 4s have any specific meaning?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just an old fashioned cue?|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: no fight now just posible over tricks |pg||

pc|c9|nt|bagman: The @DA must be with E: if W has it, then E has the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But how can you play bridge - NOT leading partners suit with Ace-x???|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You MUST have seen too many bad overcalls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: try both finesses and hope that the @d10 takes care of itself|pg||
nt|roswolf: the pass of 4@S said dont lead one i am told:) so he follows his own suggestion:)|pg||

nt|bagman: NS can make a minor suit slam|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe EW have some Namyats type of device over 1m openings|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3N-2 was only worth 20%|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  last round not finished yet?|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can show real clubs, S hand becomes very valuable with the source of tricks, heart control and trump support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if it starts 1@C 4@H, what does S bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4NT perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: but E has a hand where she can prevent NS from changing that information. After 1@C, E can bid 4@H and then?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. tough if 1@C can be short (3 or even 2 cards)|pg||
nt|bagman: if 4NT shows primary diamonds and secondary clubs then it's the bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the problem with such a bid is - what will pd think it is|pg||
nt|bagman: I wouldn't be surprised if there are some other agreements for the meaning of 4NT|pg||
nt|bagman: or no agreements :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is an area where regular partnerships are ahead of the game|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@HX is 500; it's better than the vulnerable game for EW so they might take the sac|pg||
nt|runnerup: 11 in both tables and we though how to make 10|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me slam makable if no @d lead|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Gerben42:  something to be said for 5@H overcall too|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: if trumps were 3-1 he would have to fall back on the @d hook|pg||

pc|h6|nt|runnerup: ok wrong hand|pg||

nt|roswolf: west has an automatic 4@S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe invented by a mr raptor? :)|pg||
nt|pelu: par-contract is 6@d - 5@s and 5@d making|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west thinks abt how many spades to bid?|pg||
nt|pelu: red against green 4@S is fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H open probably 10/12 constructive (and 2@D multi)|pg||
nt|davpro: When preempting with 3 in a minor you normally do not have a 4 card major. Nothing said about 5 card suits :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: even on 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|jbgood: hehe|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|pelu: for sure W cant bid 5@s - but I have been wrong before :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Having showed 44 majors and getting no reaction from partner, W could show his 3 card support expecting to be in a decent trump suit|pg||

nt|barbyh: true, |pg||
nt|barbyh: well in this case lead from a club and you holdthemto 4|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|glen: this was a tough choice for E in the other room - if NS are playing a modern style, bidding without high card points, then EW may have game|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 5@h could just escape for down 3 I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: W has so much extras that he can afford to bid the game in NT instead of looking for the spades|pg||
