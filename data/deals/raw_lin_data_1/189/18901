nt|roswolf: 10 or 11 tricks operator?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|bridge_one: with 6/5 and only 1 defencive trick normally better to play in attack|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|runnerup: perhaps east should take it away -he has got support in hearts so ..|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hawe45:  About 12 tricks again - but lucky and only in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jxxx in @D are very much - the double by Versace means balanced hand value in @S - Zaleski can reopen|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|eamongall: the non-vul Townsend might venture an insurance 4@Hs |pg||

pc|h2|nt|roswolf: south wont get in much to lead trumps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would also make on the @S-lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead small @S possible but @H equivalent - many use to overcall 1@S in West to give the lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with weak 5332 i agree to pass like Versace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But an overcall would put the contract in South, so...|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing really helps,but contracts should have been by south this time -by n= -if spade lead,but now 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the option between @H and @S lead is a typical problem in bridge|pg||

pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: i prefere to lead in the suit more solid, but without a solid suit i prefere the lead from small cards - but is is only a opinion|pg||

nt|rcerreto: and !@s gets established|pg||
nt|blum1956: not yet|pg||
nt|rcerreto: much better to ruff 1@d in dummy|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but, with @h 4-1 you can't afford to give 1 @d away|pg||
nt|blum1956: But if he starts with the @d Ace that may be a disaster|pg||
nt|rcerreto: difficult hand, with closed cards|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|blum1956: Yes he does not know that hearts are 3-2 diamonds being 5-2|pg||
nt|eamongall: it will be interesting to see how declarer plays these @Ds ...of course we all see the right way double dummy |pg||
nt|rcerreto: maybe 2 round of trumps ending in dummy|pg||
nt|rcerreto: if they behave, duck one @d|pg||
nt|blum1956: But this may  not help if the last trump is with West|pg||
nt|rcerreto: a spec (rightly) says: better just one round to the @hQ and then @d|pg||
nt|eamongall: how about for the rest of this match no kibitzers press GIB button and use our brains to work it out |pg||
nt|blum1956: @d what? Ruffing finess? Duck?|pg||
nt|eamongall: I think its a tough problem for declarer |pg||
nt|rcerreto: I think you can handle one bad break, not two|pg||
nt|eamongall: but if he decides 3-2 @Hs and 5-2 or better @Ds he can go ahead in some comfort|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 4-1@h more likely than @d 5-2 ?|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  4NT perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: but E has a hand where she can prevent NS from changing that information. After 1@C, E can bid 4@H and then?|pg||
