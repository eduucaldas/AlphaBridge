mb|4C!|nt|panosk: and alll the matches of the last round http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda7.html|pg||
nt|panosk: 4cl unknown bicolour i guess|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5c down 1 but e-w may save|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe majors with 4D as diamonds plus major|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5C from N orth looks normal|pg||
nt|odysseus69: then decision time|pg||
mb|5C|nt|panosk: Victor if West had passed wud you bid 5cl also?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no -3nt|pg||
nt|panosk: true much beter contract|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: senn sible choice but will West sit?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: should pass |pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|nt|panosk: there is an old saying about these situations "level 5 belongs to the opponents" quite usefull here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs 3 good cards to make 5M and if pd has 3 then at least 5c probably going down|pg||

nt|danilo1: with @CK good played ... surprise @S lead may beat .. but guess @H lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi for u to Markku:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: if @S lead .. declarer must leav twice .. than switch to @H |pg||
nt|runnerup: so this can be beaten,but probably makes|pg||
nt|danilo1: Sementa knows South has trap pass over 1@H ... so may well chosse @S|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|pelu: also 3Nt in OR|pg||
nt|danilo1: really?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|granguru:  funnily if  opens the hand (1N) there is a good chance to arrive at 6@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  could be worth a couple of imps if it is played by West in the other room|pg||
nt|chmitty: I must say that I never met the pair sitting EW ... not been introduced to Mister West nor Mister East|pg||
nt|ntmon: improved|pg||
nt|dburn: well, South decided to play for 4-4 spades, so the defence won't be tested any more|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|nt|psyck: Hi John & Vladimir|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|runnerup: no test at all -so 5 @d only game if all awake but this was too easy beaten|pg||

nt|granguru:  another potential slam here|pg||
nt|granguru:  a better one thou|pg||
nt|pelu: only need to play @s-siut with no loser|pg||
nt|granguru:  still it  needs @s 2-2 or stiff honor in E and a good guess|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi all|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, it would not have been a very difficult test, it's true|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The Aussie bidded best here by NS as well as W pressed at 2@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ntmon: straghtforward game on  21 |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi all - as every time there are problems before the first match - players has to find the right table and so on|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3NT or 5@c both cold here|pg||
nt|chmitty: not an easy bid for North|pg||
nt|chmitty: Can our operator disclose the names of the players sitting EW ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: oh yes :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: ty|pg||
nt|peachy: He might go for the practical 3NT if this were MPs, not so sure IMPs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5c for ns if they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: not with odds - but better that a "Roland-slam"|pg||
nt|bernix: part score battle again. can NS buy it in 3@h ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all, gutten morgen Bernard|pg||
nt|bernix: hi danilo|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  Pleased to see that South has a name, but I think I'll stick with 'South'|pg||
nt|granguru:  exchange black QÂ´s and it would have been a rock iron contract|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: we begin with a possible slam|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: Rodwell did open the N hand with 1NT???|pg||
nt|chmitty: Difficult for South to imagine he has so many defensive tricks !|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will North x now ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hope for him there was not too much of an hesitation behind the screen|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S might have doubled. Vul versus notvul, N had great expectations of making, the colors tell he was not preempting|pg||
nt|chmitty: I agree 100% Raija|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t understand leads from Hxx|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi John|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 clubs best here 6nt /e also|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|granguru:  I would have done it if @CK|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think many in the field will bid this one|pg||
nt|chmitty: he must protect the score of his pair|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|granguru:  NICE TO see u again Raija |pg||
nt|granguru:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Convention cards are not available so unfprtunately we cannot explain bidding|pg||
nt|granguru:  at NT or any Moysean|pg||
nt|chmitty: Next door bidding started 2@s (E) 4@s ... NOrth thinking|pg||
nt|danilo1: nice 6@C ... if by mistake in 6@S - or even 6NT (E) ... all will make|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: and I would open 1@D 100% (=4+@d)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North has distribution and they have a lot of controls|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@C cue X @Cs|pg||
nt|granguru:  N could have xx to show second round ctrl|pg||
nt|pelu: when N open 1Nt then Meckstroth has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|pelu: RD = 1. round control|pg||
nt|granguru:  but then it is more complicate to show @d ctrls|pg||
nt|granguru:  RD is second if 4@C was first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmmm and a 6-3 c fit not too imp;ressive|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c instead of 2nd x would have worked better|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|pelu: @H-lead - 2x@s and @C finess|pg||
nt|psyck: same bidding in other room though|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|pelu: ok that makes life easyer for dsecl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: although 4-2 foirtunate lie in h|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's standard in Poland overcalls are limited, so strong 1-suited hand should X first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course but no 2nd x for me|pg||
nt|ntmon: but after preemptive raise, problems arise|pg||
nt|psyck: if 1345, i'd have Xed 2nd time too, thought 4@c was clearer this hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|granguru:  If I would be forced to guess  1@C strong 1@S=4 ctrls 2N nat 19-21 3@D @C ctrl no @D ctrl|pg||
nt|bernix: phantom sac|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: 4 obvious tricks for defence|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  It is much easier for us, but can South have less than this to make a slam try with no heart control?|pg||
nt|danilo1: ideal def. is - first @H for A, than @DK and third @D ... guess not easy for Adam now ... since North cann well be single @D |pg||
nt|bernix: but it doesn't matter if he cashes a 2nd @d before switching to hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ntmon: i'm inclined to 4@C too but no strong opinion|pg||
mc|9|nt|peachy: lots of work in 6NT, not impossible I think, but rather aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  a passive lead is a must here|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm thinking E will lead club, that would be my choice|pg||
nt|granguru:  it seems 3@d was nat as N went on to 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: but I am not in Hurd's class of player so we'll see|pg||
nt|granguru:  most passive is @D|pg||
nt|granguru:  the @D10 is a critical card (not here thou) so W has 4 critical suits|pg||
nt|psyck: sry folks, have to switch to another room, c ya|pg||

nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it is a good idea that the very first control is A (or KQ)|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|granguru:  not vul sorry only 22!|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, by the end of tha match, maybe I learn some French by osmosis :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and me some English|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the usual 4-1 break|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - you'd need a relay method to reach 6NT by East with certainty|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at least the sa is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: 2@d both majors ?|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4 IMP for Krajewski - 5@D on  1 doubled|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chmitty: seems so|pg||
nt|peachy: Long time ago, we used to call those bids Polish two suiters, nowadays there are several variations and names for them|pg||
nt|peachy: Hungarian kib tells it is 5@h-4@s, or 4414 or 4405, 11-15HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  would like to hear your arguments...I am open minded :)|pg||
nt|bernix: this looks like a run-of-the-mill 4@s to me|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chmitty: So Lauria will probably reject the option of double ... which could be effective in front of a @s lenght|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  kibz might enjoy an expert view on the matter|pg||
nt|paulg:  I don't think cue bidding first and second round controls equally makes a huge difference to bidding slams, a lot of it still comes down to judgement|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  i think the italians beat the americans so often because they had practised partnerships and better bidding methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  being an  expensive deparment players try to reduce judgement and increase accuracy|pg||
nt|granguru:  good advice...on all contracts under 6NT|pg||
nt|peachy: There are no convention cards available for us (or anyone) so appreciate kib help in interpreting bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought they play transfers over 1c|pg||
nt|dburn: may not be so easy to stop these in a partscore, after all|pg||
nt|danilo1: if to play 4@S ... West should declare|pg||
nt|dburn: but they managed it - this is a partscore|pg||
nt|runnerup: true you cant guess in teams -solid 6 @c ok -here only 3 spades  makes  |pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe Duboin didn't actually pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: 3@c sounds like maximum with 5-card suit doesnt it|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk NS play 1NT 15-17 (or at least did before) ... 1@C is choice I believe (agree, 6 controls, no soft values, hand better for suit contracts)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@S by West may make ... no chance if by East|pg||
mb|2S|nt|granguru:  agree paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand has another debatable point .. how do you break transfers?|pg||
nt|pelu: too difficult to start a cue bid if only A, a cue is an invitation for slam and often u will miss that - and bidding economy also tell u to start with the lovers cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Since there were so many small boards in the first half, I was hoping that all the spectacular stuff had been saved for the second half. False hopes...|pg||
nt|granguru:  from 6NT on the strategy changes|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1NT will be played on most tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 toptricks for defense, but not easy to take them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i dislike showing a weak doubleton and telling them what to lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  at top level players almost always lead the right card|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|granguru:  so it is better to bid accurately|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
nt|dburn: Sementa might only raise to three, but he's more likely to bid four|pg||
nt|dburn: and he did, before I could finish typing that he would|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: East has found a strong lead.|pg||
nt|dburn: still, with this lead...|pg||
nt|danilo1: Well, now we have 4@S by West :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: now 7 tricks for Tokay|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3@C dont show about @Cs but only maxz and 3 card support|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i approve of breaking the transfer with only 3-card support, when you are so suitable|pg||
nt|granguru:  once hamman erred a gran slam lead...20 years the hand was appearing in the news|pg||
nt|peachy: running scores Round 3 (this round) http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda3.html|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|granguru:  And he used Judgement..with 2 aces he led the shortest one..(wrong)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ntmon: i think they play crystallic clear Polish club, book version (2005 edition)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be as JASSEMS polish is transfer inh his book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well. Helped a bit, but agree u|pg||
nt|runnerup: so vulnerable try -no trial just bid it -if not made -perhaps even anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: ...Duboin still can't make it, I don't think, but if North puts up the ace...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chmitty: Great decision by Lauria : 5@c would be at least 2 off when 4@h is down|pg||
nt|peachy: I did find a fairly recent card for EW http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|MolvaM: running a long suit usually creates problems for the defence|pg||
nt|peachy: NS basic system is Strong Club|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: he can't put the seven on this, because South might have @c98 doubleton, but he may still be OK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: Now a club ruff will beat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with best defence. a @c switch now|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @h9 ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  looks to ask for @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Failing that, a trump misguess by declarer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in that case possibilities to -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  E isn't willing to ask for a @c switch, not knowing what partner has in @c I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was declarer, after a transfer response to 1@C, at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if there is any possibility to defeat, it must be a @c ruff by E. Declarer can have @sKQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW missed the defense against 4@S - played by S: @H to K, @D to A Now @CK to A, @S to 8 and Q, @CJ to Q - but not @C again|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: now 9|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d ruff for -1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|pelu: well played by W - he set up a trap - and N fall in|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and looking happily for the 10th|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@S is not good contract ... correct pass by Balicki ... |pg||
pc|d6|nt|ntmon: transfers don't fit much into the system, 1@D needs to be negative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and E must see that it´s needed with @ha and knowing that N has @cK|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|danilo1: makin if he starts with @H first ... not impossible after @C lead |pg||
nt|dburn: he can play hearts now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|granguru:  looks that there is no way to win...no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  @DK ?|pg||
nt|peachy: There are 15 groups of 8 teams each, the top three (I think) will advance to the Swiss, from where top teams advance to KO etc|pg||
nt|peachy: This isnt quite making, I think|pg||

pc|h6|nt|granguru:  at 6NT the reason is not to give the 12th trick ...normally declarer coudnt find a suit to play...so usually no long suit..if 12 tricks there, there is nothing to lose...but if just 11 you must be carefull not to give 1 trick on the lead.|pg||

nt|granguru:  garozzo had another saying..when you have a singleton, lead it...|pg||
nt|granguru:  obviously at suit contracts|pg||
nt|peachy: It is one of his famous "Rules"|pg||
nt|granguru:  in general, it made life easier for the defense...if you didnt lead a singleton..you didnt have it...|pg||
nt|peachy: Another one of Garozzo's: "Must have a very good reason for not leading trump"|pg||
nt|danilo1: he knows that pd must have very good @S + need @HK + more than just A in @D ... if all this, Adam would not bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|danilo1: but if he played @H before cashing second trump ... than meight do|pg||
nt|runnerup: 7 @s  here|pg||
nt|runnerup: bidding test|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ah a slam and a minor one at that|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rcerreto:  openings are getting lighter and lighter, these days|pg||
nt|paulg:  his line did have a lot of play|pg||
mb|1S|nt|granguru:  well if @H behave he could have made it..but that would have mean @S were also 1-1 and the line should have been different|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but a good sacrifice too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: At Last tempo would have been better by @H ruffs. Hard to se for them|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@H? .. guess best bid|pg||
nt|dburn: key is South's diamond holding, but if South can get a diamond bid in before North bids Blackwood|pg||
nt|dburn: then North may be able to find what he needs to know|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not like Splinter with A .. as well as do not like 4@S with this distribution|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite an interesting one|pg||
nt|dburn: so 4@c-4@d-4NT-5@h-6@d (asking for third round control)|pg||
nt|danilo1: besides on 2@H may hear @D support and than key card (for @D!!!) |pg||
nt|dburn: despite that being a splinter with the stiff ace, it seems the best way for North to find out what he needs to find out|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see 4@C?|pg||
nt|dburn: he can't really bid 2@h - he would have the Devil's own job getting back to spades if South were to raise hearts|pg||
nt|danilo1: i would bid 2@H - cannot cost since I can allways corect @H contract to @S|pg||
nt|runnerup: dont see many choises|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: top-players dont like the @d-suit :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@d must be relay for clarification, and 3@c shows no major probably|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will south bid 3NT with 3 small spades ?|pg||
nt|dburn: how is partner to know, after 1@d-1@s-2@h-3@h-3@s that you have four spades and two hearts, rather than five diamonds, four hearts and a spade cue bid?|pg||
nt|runnerup: and here it came|pg||
nt|danilo1: if pd has 3-card @D ... @DQ may bi vital card ... and therefore, I would like to hear @D fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2C prob Precision style, 5-6 clubs with possible 4-card major|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rcerreto:  tough lead|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  nothing appeals, @d looks normal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I know about 3700 people who would bid 2nt with east hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  as I said at the beginning ..probably @S finesse instead of a @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is 2s not forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed you would - but you cannot cope with a simple raise in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Mahaffey won the first match 17-13 against a team from Romania (with Bocchi-Maddala!?), Aspe lost 10-20 to a strong team from England|pg||
nt|granguru:  panski plays 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  leading the longest suit is always an option|pg||

nt|runnerup: who is the boss now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: good contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c more precise : no major and only one stopper ... South assumes the stopper is @s :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@H is I guess 3NT try ... Cezary knows how valid is @CQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: We have 4 diferent options by us 4 commentators. WHAT IS THE BEST BID AT E IN THE LONG TERM?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr.N|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  Bocchi-Madala are playing for Lavazza in another group, whatever the results page says|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: there is a little misunderstanding after explanation|pg||
nt|ntmon: protective X from W - can be really costly now|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi George|pg||
nt|danilo1: wha not ... than pd has 5-card @S ... so @DQ no more vital ... @HK instead ... again Key-card ... and final contract ... in @S|pg||
nt|runnerup: south took blacwood-so perhaps norht take 7|pg||
nt|danilo1: problem here is that they both need to chk what pd has in @D ... and they did not do it|pg||
nt|dburn: North can presumably show @dK and @sQ now|pg||
nt|runnerup: he should tell his card and all he still needs is Q @d |pg||
nt|dburn: but South can't count 13 tricks after that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s from N? in my opinion too strong and he must be happy that S could bid|pg||

nt|pelu: strange take out X by Baldurson|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Vladimir|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|ralfwil: a 6-card suit @hK and a stiff @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade game needs to be bid.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  good sacrifice in 5@d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1@s probably shows 3 card spades?|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - prob support x in @H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or a dont-lead-a-diamond system|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I don't know that 1@H was right when East had indicated the majors.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe it was also meant to show real @c|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  unsure though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me a strong 3@s rise and an invite to 4@s|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and baldurson dbl is kind of a support dbl?|pg||

nt|danilo1: interested in choice what/how to bid by South (1@C Polish, most often 12-14 BAL) |pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Allerton may have misread 3@H but East can correct.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, this is the sort of board we were looking for, after so much drab stuff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he has a pretty good hand, in context|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you agree with the strong rise David?|pg||
nt|peachy: Strong 1C, probable 0-7 or some such 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  under this premise I agree fully..the same philosophy of the 6NT lead..dont give tricks away to declarer on the initial lead.|pg||
nt|granguru:  when you have points in all side suits normally declarer has a solid trump suit...|pg||
nt|ntmon: worked!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the best with this bidding is that W has shown his @h honour|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe their standard for free bids is higher than yours and mine|pg||

nt|granguru:  very poor fits all over|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW has 3 5-2 ones|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS only @D 4-4|pg||
nt|danilo1: if he guess rite in @H may even make 6 (do not believe) .. if Info is correct (4@H Dbled in OR). will not be good for Monaco|pg||
nt|daman: they cannot get in safely over a 3@D opening|pg||
nt|danilo1: no 7 by Bocchi -Madala in OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam 6@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: that usually means our vugraf operator will soon close this table and reopen it to establish the link to the other table|pg||
nt|ntmon: not much on play yet, really|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: what shld tokay do? dbl?|pg||
nt|chmitty: unless the ace of trumps fell on the floor :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Operator, 2C should have been down two, maybe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: surprising, that - their auction seemed well on track until the final bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: 4@D made against the 300 here, so a big swing to Badger.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was wondering if South would overcall 1@s, easier to overcall 1NT perhaps|pg||
nt|granguru:  probasbly e could have avoided the mistake overtaking @D and playing @c9|pg||
nt|paulg:  west cannot make a penalty double these days|pg||
nt|rodal f: Whom to reach NY as low as possible?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again 1Nt with a 5 card @S - |pg||
nt|rodal f: *NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: and now ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 1NT 12-16 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: North was in 3NT at the other table, doubled and ran to 4@D.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be hearts and a minor, so North asks|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1NTx was sort of +380 but Soith escapes|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok: 2@d showed a 11-13 hand with 3@h. sry for this mess, but its really difficult to guess the meaning of ART bids. And its boring to be silent... :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not much point reaching New York - they need to stay in Poznan for a few more days|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h from N now! |pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: not the best lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3d could be makable but tokay wasnt sure about 5 cards @d|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS guessing can win 3@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1D! negative, 0-6(7) |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like dbl from E. Ha has a 5-card @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry he....|pg||
mb|4H|an| |mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  do EW play transfer?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Transfers opposite 1@C are popular.|pg||
nt|granguru:  we will see a good fight here|pg||
nt|granguru:  as 2@S is a difficult contract to win|pg||
nt|ntmon: or not|pg||
mb|5D|nt|brolucius: With four aces missing, it seems that the three-level may be high enough.|pg||
nt|pelu: that the problem with 1@D opening - partner dont know if u have 2 or 5 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 4@s - but US never found the @s-fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  mmm|pg||
nt|granguru:  Does S have nothing clear  to lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: and Lauria does not give up|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok this looks obvious here :) |pg||
nt|riccho:  15 vs. 8 HCP --> both players are a bit exaggerating their hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Not knowing their system, North's Pass might have included better hands, and wek hands run immediately via Rdbl, that is one way of playing|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure how obvious is 3NT by East ... he is min, and 2 open suits ... OK, has 3 tens and 5-card @C ... still|pg||
nt|riccho:  now decl has 9 tricks in his bag. I c no other option than to play for @c to be 3-3 (or Hx somewhere). |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong lead .... and big diff. |pg||
nt|dburn: one more round of the Swiss, and both teams occupying places in the low teens with 27 qualifiers|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Obviously East had read West for a much better hand than he holds.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: and I can´t see why...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|riccho:  E needs 33 in @c without alternative, because due to communication problems he has to duck @c immediately |pg||
nt|ntmon: looks like 1@D showing @h, 1@S nat forcing, 2@C weak preference, 2@H good hand|pg||
nt|daman: makes sense to me|pg||
nt|dburn: so both of them are well enough placed not to think about heading to New York (or Australia) just yet|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ntmon: i like transfer responses to 1@C - room for many gadgets|pg||
nt|daman: yes |pg||
nt|daman: I don't think 1@D was a transfer   I think just a negative over the big club|pg||
nt|daman: <7|pg||
nt|runnerup: club ruff -diamond ruff and club ruft with j@h gives chances to defence|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Such a shame to lose IMPs unnecessarily when there are so many other ways of losing IMPs.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  could W consider his hand balanced?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then open 1NT (or rebidding, if 1NT is weak)?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was presumably non-forcing, so it is hard to see how East had enough to look for an 11-trick game.|pg||
nt|granguru:  well he treated the  hand as a croos ruffing type|pg||
nt|granguru:  and protected potential @d tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Protected diamond tricks I think|pg||
nt|ntmon: then 2@C doesn't make much sense |pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: If 1@s is´nt spades, 1nt from W looks normal for me |pg||
nt|murat: 9 tricks i guess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another claim i daresay|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|danilo1: ideal def. is I guess -3 ... now  making .. @SAK and small @C|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|granguru:  now he is not so sure anymore....|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep ... may be here they are in some "hole" of their system|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: Although, 2D foes not necessarily promise 4+ diamonds|pg||
nt|daman: it does seem starange|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s seems to have shown hearts - some Italian pairs swap 1@h and 1@s around after this start to the bidding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: In my opinion, the range 12-16 is susceptible to trouble at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: kib says my suggeswted method is common in Hungary, but we still dont know if NS play that way|pg||
nt|riccho:  with 23 HCP and no fit you have to be lucky to succeed in 3NT... |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong = unlucky (lead) |pg||
nt|daman: strange*|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h6|pg||
nt|granguru:  as we see, he changed his mind but fortunatelly N had a @S left|pg||
nt|peachy: if EW play 2/1 (which I do not know if they do)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|danilo1: waw :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  leading and slam bidding are the most expensive parts of team playing. This is another proof of that... |pg||
nt|danilo1: did he really believe that Cezary would play @C from Jxx?|pg||
nt|riccho:  declarer - much to his discomfort - found another way of handling the @c suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry gotg held up|pg||
nt|daman: Hi John|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi John|pg||
nt|dburn: other pairs use double to promise hearts, and 1@h to show spades|pg||
nt|dburn: some antedliuvian folk persist in bidding the suits they have, but they're all in Swiss B by now|pg||
nt|danilo1: what would happe if North did not ruff, @DK, but discrad @S instead?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: I was asked twice the question "what are these people doing here" :)  probably looking at the strane flag combinations|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this is the European Opan Championship|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Open|pg||
nt|granguru:  excelent defense after all|pg||
pc|d8|nt|danilo1: Adam will resolve problem ... if declar would have @HK, he will not be in hurry with @S unblock|pg||
nt|riccho:  decl may have trusted the length signal from S (it it was one...). DoesnÂ´t he know Balicki - Zmudzinski then? |pg||

nt|runnerup: in that 7 last board in other table ew came in with double and ns had chances to make live difficult them selfs by redoubling etc..|pg||
mb|4H|nt|granguru:  S should have played a @H at trick 4 in tha last hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Nort upgraded this to Strong 16+ 1C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chmitty: we can imagine NS will reach 4@s|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, ideal (double Dummy def.) was @H lead for !Q, @D back, and @H ... since @D block later ... -3 .. but NS foudnd way for  -4 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I qm surprised at 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  3@h is the probably the value bid for Mahaffey, but many just put 4@h on the table and make it the opponents' problem|pg||
nt|pelu: East for sure dont like his hand after 2@D overcall|pg||
nt|chmitty: Many will open 4@s in this position|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wrong again - oh well|pg||
nt|dburn: in theory, I guess North-South want to play this in 3NT as things are|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@H -1 on @D lead|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT GF Raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: you need take @d ruff here|pg||
nt|dburn: but it may not be so easy for West to lead a diamond - still, he has so little that he may see a ruff as the best chance to beat the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: or that @dJ will set up some tricks for his partner, at any rate|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jcomyn: I dont know how he can pass|pg||
nt|ntmon: should not be right :(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 11 tricks cold in s and he didnt even double 5c|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  South will pass, probably needs a fourth spade to double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5c at least 2 down to save some imps|pg||
nt|daman: it would be hard to stop below 3NT   I agree|pg||
nt|ntmon: hopefully 1@S is understood as forcing|pg||
mb|5H|nt|brolucius: Some might play a weak-strong 2NT on the East cards, to differentiate between strong and distributional 3@D hands.|pg||
nt|pelu: what a lead - but he will have a new chance later|pg||
nt|riccho:  heh|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  no way to play trumps from N|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then it should make|pg||
nt|murat: anybody dbl with east hand ?|pg||
nt|peachy: Molenaar must have at least thought of balancing|pg||
nt|granguru:  leslie amoils is a canadian player...wonder why she has the USA flag here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  even misguessing @d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not me|pg||
nt|murat: i mean after 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|paulg:  standard Polish lead, second highest from three|pg||
nt|granguru:  @SQ9 big helpers|pg||
nt|chmitty: let's see if declarer finds the way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: a @c at trick 2 would reveal most of the layout|pg||
nt|chmitty: North can see that East does not hold AK or KDJ @c|pg||
nt|chmitty: and not QJ@h either|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Plenty to think about before playing trick 1|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rcerreto:  oops|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  they found the way|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Both losing semifinalists are awarded bronze medals. There is no playoff for third place (a good decision in my view)|pg||
nt|brolucius: East hoping for a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, 3rd-4th place finals are dull|pg||
nt|brolucius: But neither team has a bronze medal in their sights at this moment.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  winning A and playing a @h back would have forced S to play trumps but...|pg||
nt|danilo1: to lead for ruff is good when one has blank hand|pg||
nt|dburn: and if North-South keep bidding black suits, a diamond will look more and more clear|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rcerreto:  this way has a chance to discard a @h on @s|pg||
nt|pelu: why sh he X?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rcerreto:  a very good chance now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda5.html  running now|pg||
nt|petergill: Cue bids are 1st/2nd, so N has denied @d control|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... @D lead is bid :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ntmon: more sporting contract but makes|pg||
nt|daman: I did not expect 4@S to be the final contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who would. another did you buy a lottery ticket hand|pg||
nt|dburn: too much science can be as bad as too little|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: looks like 4 losers but declarer will still look for an endplay to get rid of the@s loser|pg||
nt|murat: for a save or for some money|pg||
nt|jcomyn: missin just the KQ10876 of trumps|pg||
nt|daman: over 2@S   North could have bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ntmon: if N was afraid 1@H being passed out, should have bid 2@H|pg||
nt|daman: or    South could simply have bid 2@D over 1@S|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would bring 2@S if S has them for sure|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ntmon: i would feel elevated with S hand as such and did some cunning bidding, at least 4@D splinter |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|riccho:  another time to misguess sth for E here. Difficult to be right here after u mangled a hand like the one before. will be interesting to c if E is still inspired enought|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wrong defence. let W win the first trick and he will continue with trump|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: score now 13-1 for Lavazza|pg||
nt|chmitty: is this the actual play ????|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer does not know that DA drops doubleton, he took a chance that E lead from QJxxx|pg||
nt|danilo1: another case for invitational bid ... and pass ... especiall when playing vs. excellent defenders ... |pg||
nt|riccho:  he should do it right anyway: S didnt open but showed @hAK now|pg||
nt|danilo1: this will go down much easier (unf. also less :))|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|danilo1: Diorgio shouldplay @D10 for ruff|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru:  Leslie should be Les Amoils, male, lived in South Africa before coming to Canada|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|dburn: perhaps, but there isn't any pressing need for West to play a club - South did cue the suit, after all|pg||

mb|1H|nt|paulg:  I've noticed many pairs treat the Multi 2@d as weak with spades when it comes to their 2nd seat defence|pg||

nt|paulg:  it's rare to see that in the UK, but would work here|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: but East help him, in on @CK he played @D - ruff, @C to A @S to 10 and duck - and now endplayed - East sh play @C back and no endplay|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rcerreto:  a cheap save on 4@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S has escaped a double, but the cards lie well for declarer so the lack of a double will not cost E/W much.|pg||

nt|granguru:  is 6@C makeable?|pg||

nt|peachy: Kib who knows NS style says they love to surprise opps with frequent tactical bids|pg||
nt|riccho:  1 trick in every suit for ew = just make|pg||
nt|dburn: nervous for South - the kind of hand where if you overcall and get doubled, you know you are going down a lot against nothing|pg||

nt|runnerup: @d in time means now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but still a dbl....|pg||
nt|granguru:  2 discards on reds|pg||
nt|chmitty: as long as they do not surprise themselves that's fine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: why not - u have bid game Red against green |pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: its for me a good standard rule|pg||
nt|chmitty: Full brakes on, from North's standpoint|pg||
nt|chmitty: South has a lot ... can he give up ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 6 controls opposite strong club, he just cant pass|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: choice of plays - hate thast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably play on d and postpone finesses|pg||
nt|ntmon: on  17, meckwell started as reccomended: 1@S-2N-4@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps @H finesse, if ducked revert to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: little point in ducking|pg||
nt|ntmon: not an easy hand due to communication problems|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so many choices|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: Had the cards lain differently, not doubling might have waved goodbye to 500 or so.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may have feared a third-hand opener, but her side was vulnerable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not know that partner holds 10 points, so he cannot double 4@S even with an extra value or so. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but shouldn´t E?|pg||
nt|pelu: now N can make 1NT - topplay @Hs and only 6 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  3 discards on reds sorry|pg||
nt|granguru:  one @S given up|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk3: The contract is doubled at both tables in the other match|pg||
nt|granguru:  so just one ruff needed|pg||
nt|peachy: It is also possible that 4S was RKC|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: vugraph schedule for future matches    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: Quite right.|pg||
nt|chmitty: May be 4@s was kind of blackwood|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|peachy: it does make|pg||
nt|granguru:  not even garozzo beats 6@c here|pg||
nt|petergill: NS needs to get their @d trick before the @h are set up|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he can't pass - and even when del Monte can pass, he often doesn't|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: WD White House team|pg||
nt|peachy: It would be nice if in a competition of this level, there were convention cards available|pg||
nt|chmitty: true :(|pg||
nt|chmitty: True also that there are many pairs in competition : huge job|pg||
nt|peachy: It makes kibitzing so much nicer, to know what the auction means|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chmitty: a suggestion could be that the players had to fill themselves an "electronic convention card" before the championship|pg||
nt|ntmon: right, John :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: its a headache hand |pg||
nt|ntmon: agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: d suit may die now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chmitty: that will come soon, I'm sure|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|murat: he should played the Ace @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: N with shut down with XX showing @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: and just did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont think he found the best line entries are very short for finessing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant even get a s if d is returned|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  it is a good standard rule for me too, but not when one hand has pre-empted|pg||
nt|petergill: Good @S play - now S has to decide - @HQ or @DK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Now East may grab @CA.|pg||
nt|dburn: chances are that since East didn't double here South might get the clubs wrong|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|runnerup: south missed another chance|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|murat: now he's in trouble|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pelu: for me "multi" is nor real preemt - just a semicontructiv opening bid|pg||
nt|dburn: unusual, that - South's concentration may have slipped for a moment|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: wrong @hA ok if 3-3 and @H 10 nevber correct|pg||
pc|d9|pc|sT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|murat: did he really discard @h ?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|murat: probably not|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: yes he did|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not so careful play. must guess trump now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|dburn: but not if East does that, of course|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|danilo1: ? @S10 ... where South can see 6th def. trick if no @DK by pd ... |pg||

nt|rcerreto:  should she risk -420 to get 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|dburn: risk? what risk?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to risk a double in the first place.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: An excellent 6@D now|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer could have the singleton king of clubs only if she had about ten cards rather than thirteen|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  can declarer have one more @d one less @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on NS - a nice contract|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  N was declarer, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In theory, there is a club ruff, but fortunately for declarer, the defender with the singleton club also has @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting bidding test. If they bid it, I will applaud.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C is more tricky and that might be reached.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They may arrive in 6@C, though|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With problems on a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can they make 1C after a @c lead? I doubt|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the sort of board we were hoping for. No-one wants these matches to be decided on small margins after some drab boards.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @s lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c after a @s lead....|pg||
nt|peachy: In "real" championships, I think that is how it is done, these championships are open to anybody who wants enter from anywhere in the world, no qualification required|pg||
nt|danilo1: running scores now on: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|riccho:  a matter of style and system if u open the N hand with 1@c 2@c or 3@c|pg||
nt|riccho:  or even pass |pg||
nt|riccho:  3@c wouldnÂ´t be my choice anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i venture to say this was misplayed|pg||
nt|daman: good stuff for EW|pg||
nt|daman: N will open 4@H|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N|an| |nt|brolucius: If one side wins after doing better on the big boards, then good luck to them - (even if they are not from England)|pg||
nt|murat: that was unexpected|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the contract went both ways during play and finally declarer came out as the winner|pg||
nt|paulg:  Seeing your partner pass when you have a balanced zero count is never good|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table on Bd 7: East bid 2@S after 1@H P 2@C, so W led @S to 4@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pelu: 34 HCP - I exp slam with most tables|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s now from South?|pg||
nt|peachy: And teams can have members from any country = all transnational|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C precision style ... part of Polish @C system|pg||
nt|dburn: then, this match may be close to a tie after 7 and 8 are scored|pg||
mb|4S|nt|riccho:  so a precision like 2@c opening here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays @d before havinc cleaned trumps, another @s will set up a trumph trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: D'Ovidio has started well by emphasizing the diamonds before supporting clubs.|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS has a score sheet we all like to bring to the comparison table...all NS scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 6@C in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Waiting for the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk3: @SQ|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2NT forcing asking for clarifications|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what can ew make - d position pleasant|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: but not so easy to bid the Grand|pg||
nt|granguru:  7@D should be|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Ouch!|pg||
nt|murat: would you also prefer 2@s ?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: Imagine winning the board with 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade lead would not beat 3NT if clubs were 3-2.|pg||
nt|brolucius: not beat 6@C, I mean|pg||
nt|dburn: a result with which both teams will be quite happy - it won't hurt either's chances for qualification|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: true!|pg||
nt|paulg:  tougher when you have not shown your 5-card support for partner|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: roller-coaster :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: this is interesting|pg||
nt|murat: Tokay should work some |pg||
nt|MolvaM: has to keep south out|pg||
nt|riccho:  to duck wont help here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|granguru:  Even if that doesnt mean anything, usually it is a good sign...|pg||
nt|chmitty: Lauria could hold : Kx KQ10xxx x Kxxx whixh would produce an excellent slam|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer does not know how hearts sit so he might duck one, but as it is, does not matter|pg||
nt|riccho:  or?|pg||
nt|riccho:  it helps: decl can develop 3 tricks in @s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: bidding on bd 18 has taken off to 4nt already|pg||
nt|petergill: If NS can lock declarer out of dummy, 3@H will fail|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: would u X in West or bid 2Nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would have started with 2@d (inverted) personally, even if showing your 4-card major first seems to be growing in popularity|pg||
nt|daman: it isn't so much what they can make    can they reasonably bid over the 4@H opening?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda4.html|pg||
nt|rcerreto: la fai o non la fai la cue di x nel colore del compagno?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: sorry|pg||
nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Once all matches a completed, standings in each group will be here http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|chmitty: Lauria considering his options in case @h are 4-1|pg||
nt|peachy: there are 15 groups of 8 teams each|pg||
nt|chmitty: only danger to consider|pg||
nt|chmitty: ha can : a) play Ace @h and @h or b) play small @h to retain an extra entry in dummy or c) unblock @s ace and run Q @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no of course not unless someone doubles|pg||
nt|runnerup: go down |pg||
nt|dburn: they can do that all right - but a shift to @c9 might have been a trick more effective|pg||
nt|danilo1: @S back cannot cost|pg||
nt|runnerup: hand that is but club overruff comes anyway i think|pg||
nt|danilo1: lol :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: srry, private|pg||
nt|runnerup: south sees dummy -so i cant understand any but @s |pg||
nt|petergill: I think 27 teams qualify from Swiss A (i.e. this Section) and 5 from Swiss B, into the 28 board Knockout matches.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if @S and @S now ... Thk Giorgio will play on @HK doubleton|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: but then u would mis a 4-4 fit in @H - pd could be 4-4-3-2|pg||
nt|danilo1: since @D bad ... declare cannot come to 9 trick on time .. before Nort enters with @SK 8if Cezary just continues @C)|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
pc|s5|nt|murat: dbl i guess|pg||
nt|pelu: for 100% 2NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I would bid 2nt|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT = 16-19, D + 2Nt = 20+|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: jassem may be lucky|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|runnerup: 9 better|pg||
pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: whenever I double, lefty bids 4@h and pd bids 4@s with 4 cards|pg||
nt|danilo1: now made ... time for 3@S tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chmitty: he has choosen option a) :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and we can see he is still Ok because South is endplayed|pg||
pc|s6|nt|murat: i prefer 2NT with 15-17 |pg||
nt|murat: bad 18|pg||
nt|riccho:  now he has 9 tricks in his bag |pg||
nt|danilo1: nice @C|pg||

mb|3C|nt|Walddk3: Multon won the diamond at trick 2 and paused for a while before he played another spade|pg||

nt|petergill: These two teams running 11th and 14th right now: ref http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: E/W fighting bravely, but hard to imagine that it will be successfully.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that looked like broadcasting a football match on radio :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D must have promised @S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: a very normal way to bid on Ns hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  I played Mahaffey on vugraph in last year's Rosenblum ... luckily Meckwell were in Nickell's team on that occasion|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: All good pairs will know what to do after intervention over 4NT (in theory....)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Vriend team on their way to the final; 32-9 after a slam swing on board 23, like here|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand now, thanks to our operator Michal for a great job! Also thanks to EBL for getting these great matches shown on BBO.|pg||
nt|peachy: Also thanks to our opearor for a great job!|pg||

mb|p|nt|murat: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract in OR|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and will gain on 18 as well - odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the open event at this stage consists of short matches of 10 boards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so this is the last hand of the segment|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzers, you are the life of this party, appreciate all your comments and questions!|pg||
nt|dburn: not much in this, I guess - a club lead might beat 3NT, but I can't see why South would lead a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  I think 1NT as semi-forcing is quite popular, where North might pass 1NT?|pg||
nt|riccho:  some work here for decl to deny 6 defensive tricks here|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice lead by Martens|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: hate that bidding - cant find a 4-4 s fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: would be a nice lead against 4@S if reached|pg||
nt|ntmon: another odd gain on  20 - on missinng the right contract?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the world-wide disease - find some level of nt as soon as possible|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk3: The official site has a score of 30-27 in this match. Not easy to know what to believe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cronier may fear a diamond ruff in 6@S, because he has offered the lower-scoring slam with excellent spade support.|pg||
