mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|bigtrain: hi danilo|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3NT EW ... will East have currage to bid it?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: precision players try to clarify the @D suit whenever possible thus the 2@D bid|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|bigtrain: since opening 1@D is like opening noise -- no suit implication|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|danilo1: @HA and of course, @SQ |pg||
nt|danilo1: if declarer had @SKA and needed to ruff @S, he would do it before playing trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: roddy is trying to figure out the meaning of the @D7 at trick one|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|danilo1: and therefore, for his biding, has to have @CA|pg||

nt|ady: thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Hello everybody|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|ady: 4@H looks ok for e/w   but can beaten if defence finds 2 diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D  makes if getting heart right|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 4@s or 5@c playable|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  do well in spades in spite of 4-1 split|pg||
nt|ady: sorry of course 3 losers in diamonds for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If 2 @D is a weak-2 - itÂ´s awful|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@D seems to have stolen the hand|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I would not open 2H with 4 cards in the other major in 2nd hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And so much values in minors|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: 420 is par, use entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to finess in @s immediately|pg||
nt|ady: not the way to beat 4@H|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jr7: Hi all - no names, but we are playing|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the trump lead doesnt hurt declarer much|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|roswolf: are these the right teams/names?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ace of @H and a @h will be a deception for North|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d5|pc|c5|pg||

nt|hawe45:  How to bid 3 NT - I see no way to that contract|pg||
nt|cenglund:  There is a risk to end up in 4 hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They probably open 1H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It would have more idea to open THIS West-hand with 2 @D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  It was a disaster for the South Africans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but I wouldÂ´nt do it|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: 4@H  down 2 in open room   11 imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hans , Christer , Specs good afternoon to all |pg||
mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: but - at least in teams - declarer should have played @sA and @s10 before the last trumph. a good player can duck @sJ|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|cenglund:  Meck opened 1D with the puny collection of high cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The problem is: You take these two first West-hands and compare. There is TOO much fifference - so partner never will know, what you have, when you open 2 @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@D opener , with diferent type of hands|pg||
mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: double by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  As predicted!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Hi all|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S play either straight forward 2/1 or transfer after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: N opened 3 @c and E made a nonleaping Michaels 4@d, so 4@h was wrongsided and got a @d lead|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT by South is not bad with spade lead from King|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes @H + @D behave well|pg||
nt|rmb1: Meanwhile South could X or bid NT now|pg||
nt|ady: not wild about 2@S from east|pg||
nt|jbgood: 500 in 2@s x - but that will not happen|pg||
nt|mamos: don't know geoffrey|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only + = both hands had the 10 of @S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 11 fast reicks for N-S  in minor |pg||
nt|cenglund:  True, but I am sure they would have opened 1H, but Meck did not allow that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that a @S-shift will kill 5 @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so fast... - these 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the 11 trick of @D can be a problem in this hand |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|kirp:  S takes ull by the horns|pg||
nt|kirp:  bull not ull|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Nice bid by South!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: ah they change|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and now 3 NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi mike|pg||
nt|mamos: Mahaffey EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least this will be fast:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead is obligatory, otherwise 11 tricks|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: you might have seen me playing with Olsen on BBO, his nick is James950|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's actually a regular on BBO |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nowhere else to go?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5@c also good|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is club ace realistic lead|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S North?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No @S-lead also OK naturally|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jameslee 2: K@S lead |pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: 4@H will be more interesting|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 4@h:) at least on a spade lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: or duck of heart lead now|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a clear duck! If declarer has @hAjxxx why not finess?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: i think it is, this play only makes sense if south has heart ace|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jameslee 2: bad luck to see 11 and not make them |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|jbgood: perhaps N might have tried 3@s over 3 @h?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: yes jack was a mistake|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad luck for declarer|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: thats it |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he is the one that can see them not the others |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now -2 for 3 IMPÂ´s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - if he tries to make it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  This would be wrong with 3 @C together with 4 @D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade 10 prevent declarer from squeezing East|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other room 5@C -1|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: what are the best chances? enter dummy on @sA and play a small @h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: small heart from hand trick 2 looks fine|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cenglund:  Mahaffey may discard a spade and then declarer will prevail|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sQ|pc|h2|nt|cenglund:  Now it's -1|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: upps |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rmb1: @C finesse and @H finesse|pg||
nt|ady: re hi all   got disconnected|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not missed much - declarer edging his way towards his contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West has a weak-2 - and East will keep the @HÂ´s|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: see they chose the 4-3 heart fit     looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|rmb1: More effective auction in OR|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up the hearts   but clubs blocked  so will hav e to lose 1 more|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: miss fit for N-S reds againts -blacks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: part score lets see where|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cenglund:  You could not imagine that he scored a trick in a side suit missing KQJ10|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  Precision @C by W|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S can make 3@h and E/W can make 3@d, but need accurate play to make 3@H I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed mike -straightforward bd|pg||
mb|1N|an| |mb|p|nt|kirp:  3@H looks ambitious on 43|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@d was suction|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @H or @s and @c|pg||
nt|rmb1: According to their card, South could open 1NT,  not sure why he didn't|pg||
mb|2C|nt|oosmanb: 3@D probably for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@h might be tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this 2@D is a new species, at least for me|pg||
nt|kirp:  curious to see how high EW get now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nobody will agree - but life is fantastic. if you open he North hand with 1 @C|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 2@s on the way to 3@d?|pg||
nt|ady: bad diamond split may beat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt!?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other table meck made the 2@H with the sing 8@C lead |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: but here bidding to finishe |pg||
nt|cenglund:  Multi is a dangerous gadget - for both sides|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S: I confirm my 5-card-suit...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kirp:  E showed 5-7 hcp, so no strain on raise to 3@D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this just needs @C Ace onside, (or Ax @S?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Loose one @D and ruff one, could be just one @D loser|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may lose to the king and ruff one - that would give 10|pg||
nt|ady: yes    will have to take care|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks certain|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume the 1@S bid denied 4@H|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Yes - at the 3-level...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos:  So Diamonds are 3-3 and soon declarer wil smile|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that the odds are on north only having 3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|STRIK3R: will find the A of @c and @s after 1@d, since 1@h was a freely bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: this looks very good for NS, all games down and lots of values|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks on any lead, so a nice stop|pg||

pc|c8|nt|jameslee 2: not and easy spot to make 9 lets she what can happend |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|oosmanb: actually maybe it also needs A@S onside or @D 2-2, so you can get to 2nd @c trick|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: looks to bwe going about it the right way|pg||
nt|mamos: or communication problems is a better way of expressing it|pg||

nt|rmb1: X from East?  4@C seems too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: @S partial|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean: 6 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  14-16 hcp, 3@C is simple Stayman|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Yes, because there is not way of pitching the losing diamonds|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@C = singleton @C not in the goos spot for N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @H...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Meck hates to bid bad slams, but he did not follow his principle on this one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very dificult not to bid 6@H here |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cue-bids might be invented these days|pg||
nt|cenglund:  RKCB is not the answer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but on info controls could be a good stop from N-S lets see |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South has bad values in the side-suits|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he could bid it directly or not |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: long think |pg||
nt|cenglund:  I suppose 3C shows minimum|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mamos: Dbl =?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This was the solution - now 4 @H and thatÂ´s it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Now he cant cue bid 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If he does, he might make the slam...!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: let,s see if S can help N to bid the good contract |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jbgood: stole it|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club switch now|pg||
nt|mamos: South squeezed out of auction|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Provided that 4C was not a query of some kind|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. Either a @d lead or continue with @s|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @c lead ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not easy to pick that contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  3N is fairly lucky to make, 3@C could be 5 CMS looking at 3@S bid to show 4@Hs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can he play on @C instead of @H ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  W showed @S if any 4 crd major, so @S lead is not best usually|pg||
mb|6H|nt|cenglund:  They are heading for same destination|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there they go to 6@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kirp:  may play on @Hs |pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hate to - but have to! - syt it: POOR BIDDING AT BOTH TABLES|pg||
nt|hawe45:  say it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I don't think that this slam is unavoidable|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: i want to bid|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: this is what happened!|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kirp:  small @H best now, but @D finesse works|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: considering his middelcards in @c, playing one round on @h's was more attempting, needed to try @c's if first @h failed?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Team Angelini picked up more imps in board 2 when the other room bid 3NT instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|kirp:  ad hope NY couldn't take 3@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: a fair punt, but didnt work out|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes, I guess J@H onside is higher %age than @C 3-3? |pg||
nt|kirp:  3@S lead certainly gave defense little chance to figure out what to do|pg||
nt|kirp:  if @H J is onside, then has time to test @Cs and if not 33, then @Ds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D finesse|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt he need @d finesse in any case? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  They are "buried" in their conventions!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Both N-S pairs thought that it's a big minus|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|jbgood: needed to safety play diamonds to win|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: likely not much difference here since NS on for 4@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  still only 8 trix with J@H onside|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to get 3@d tricks, so @d finesse is very much needed|pg||
nt|kirp:  S should have continued @Hs ,then needed @D finesse|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jameslee 2: we,ll after all (no score)  we shall keep 12-12|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: now has to drop doubleton A@S eith east    play towards K@S    then drop ace 2nd round|pg||
nt|jbgood: still 1 down may be cheap|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kirp:  another pickup for EW, as they played 1N in OR|pg||

nt|cenglund:  The level of bridge seen so far has been rather poor and not what we had expected|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Well spotted Martin|pg||

nt|ady: 4@S  makes    just lose 3 trump tricks|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|STRIK3R: 1NT from North, 0-2@h's|pg||
nt|rmb1: South has enough shape/points to insist on game|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  does 1N deny 4@S?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: made 4@H on board 7 in open|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@H made in the other room, even though East was on lead and led @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I mean West was on lead|pg||
nt|mamos: the results service for this tourney is indeed the best ever http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orr7t31-1.htm  120 tables in play in the Open teams and every score  on the internet in a ...|pg||
nt|mamos: flash|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: they might play 3NT     might make with fortunate lay of club honors|pg||
nt|rmb1: X of 2@C even by passed hand, is a bit thin|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: transfer?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@H might be a transfer or smolen (5+S - 4 H)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jbgood: I would not think of Smolen with 6 @s:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Just trying to get North to declare spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: but surely looks like it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rmb1: I thought East may double 4M based on West's earlier double.  But he has a different view of the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: East discarded a @d, and Nunes ruffed the 4th @D good|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: west thinking of attacking @c's?|pg||
nt|jbgood: is this true?|pg||
nt|rmb1: He may double 5M :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: and North is thinking ... ?|pg||
nt|jbgood: firs willing to play 4@h then 5 @s? Where is dicipline? (but N might have bid 3 NT with his double club stopper|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rmb1: I think 3@H was misunderstood|pg||
nt|ady: crazy bidding|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: No double:)|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N was punished after a - for me forbidden - lead from Jxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: board 8 spade lead is right at imps as best shot to beat hand, but more dubious at match points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: over 50% difference between +1 and +2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe the most important decision at mp is the opening lead, which is not given enough consideration|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: but self inflicted and well deserved|pg||

pc|h6|nt|oosmanb: yeah|pg||
nt|kirp:  even after a @H switch by S, one duck and S has no more entries|pg||
nt|oosmanb: too many stoppers in @s, no entry for @H, |pg||
nt|kirp:  however there are transport problems|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4 more IMPs to Angelini|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3rd seat 1@H seems like it might disrupt things a bit|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: was almost expecting Olsen to open 2@H|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|jr7: I think they are trying to catch the play they are playing now!|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ady: maybe some back for Aptekar|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kirp:  small @D towards J, now W has to hope Q@C dblton|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think there were problems with small @D to J too, then you dont have tempo for @C tricks|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: instead of about 95%|pg||

nt|ady: set|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thanks to BBO and EBL for organising.  Thanks to operator.  Thanks to David and Jon|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT is no safe winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: Yes, playing the K works if AQ is not on same hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jr7: 4@S in Ø/V only 2 down|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jameslee 2: specs are on favour of a 3nt -1 on @D lead |pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT  even on a heart lead    but unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so not such big swing |pg||

mb|p|nt|kirp:    think tahts what he was hoping for|pg||
