pc|h2|pg||

nt|roswolf: normal contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: i feel 4th from longest and strongest works best except from an ace|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@C will find hearts, but at the cost of being too high.  Meck likeds the double fit potential|pg||

nt|jfaria:  chances are to play for A@c onside ...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: and i strongly dislike leading from a doubleton if pd didnt bid the suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: not a surprise that it waqs dup0kicated|pg||
nt|daman: there are no guarantees over the 2@H opening   he shouldn't try to convert +50 to +100|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: exactly same auction  and result in CR|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: not plain sailing|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@S = asking w/o a spade fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = balancede|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: better played by south   more likely a more friendly lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: probably scrambles home with 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: can certainly  male    but will need to duck 1st diamond|pg||
nt|ady: then play up to QJ6 clubs   and then up to QJ2 spades seems best|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate diamonds 6-2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to find the winning play to score more than 1 heart trick   but 1  heat trick may be enough if  6 black suit tricks are made|pg||

nt|ady: for sure it is not|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||

nt|ady: west has decided on club switch|pg||

nt|daman: well on his way to making now|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: spade back now best  and if low club  then 3rd spade    may be a communication problem|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/israel/ronpa-gino.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: and EW landed in 5@d|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|ntmon: @S partscore to EW|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27+5 = 32 teams will qualify for the knockouts. members of the eliminated teams can enjoy the open pairs event starting tomorrow|pg||
nt|dburn: but this match will be fast - both teams are sure to qualify, there is no carry-over, so they will save their energies for the knock-out stages|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/usa2/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not now he wont|pg||
nt|panja: this must have gone too fast to record|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: is that supposed to be a rubbish multi?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= multi, 2M= 10-13|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl =diamonds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so this is max 9 hcps|pg||
nt|dburn: well, rubbish is as rubbish goes - that's pretty sound, not vulnerable in first seat|pg||
nt|hedyg: i never consider a 6-4 hand as rubbish anyhow|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok bid your suit is the consensus for rdbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass would show @ds, not XX|pg||
nt|dburn: but I would be surprised to find that redouble showed diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: some play that redoubled means "I don't want to compete" - they would bid 2@s to mean "I want to compete in hearts, but not spades"|pg||
nt|roswolf: americans have a marked weakness against the multi -i t is extremely discouraged in the state|pg||
nt|3for3: that is how we play the redouble.  not sure it is best. since they are often in trouble when they enter with balanced garbage|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is no carryover to the round of 32|pg||
nt|roswolf: you would hope meckwell at least have sensible methods|pg||
nt|3for3: they do play sensible methods.  but doubling 2@D is not free, especially when the partner of the multi has some diamond length|pg||
nt|hedyg: to pass with @ds is normal i believe as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 6+ @ds|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would ignore the rdbl and bid 3@C SHOWING VALUES + clubs(going via leb would be weaker)|pg||
nt|3for3: meck usually isnt this slow|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm is south choosing between 3@C OR 4@c?|pg||
nt|dburn: he may be asking questions of West, of course|pg||
mb|d|an| |mb|1N|nt|woozle: 6NT has chances with a spade lead - four spades, three hearts, three diamonds, one club and a squeeze on south|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but ns might get busy in h|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s was intermediate?|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs tell me XX used to be bid your major  for EW|pg||
nt|3for3: it might be west who is thinking, but i doubt it.|pg||
nt|3for3: usually these auctions are fairly automatic for the multi side.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i had assumed that rodwell's dbl showed 12-15 bal or very strong -does anyone know for sure?|pg||
nt|dburn: doesn't look as though redouble was diamonds, at any rate - West would have bid if it did|pg||
nt|3for3: i would bet with you |pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Mahaffey probably thinks he conceeded a swing in previous board..|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as long as s passes|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2H was 5H + 5other|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: but higher suit probably wins|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3@c was obviously value-showing, given North's 3NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|woozle: Fiona Brown is very cautious with her barren 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive reopening by north|pg||
nt|panja: that 1Nt is a risk VUL|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|MolvaM: 10-13 I am told ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: some may have doubled as east-t/o of course|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or 11-13 I am also told  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@C here on ice|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no CC for NS, soemthing between SEF and 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6nt from east cold as well|pg||
nt|panja: 5 other including @S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not yet|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead 4th from longest!|pg||
nt|dburn: and I suppose he might make it, if East doesn't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|jfaria:  after N said he has got the blacks there is no great deal about bidding @c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|3for3: 3nt is reasonable spot. the diamond stopper looks weak, but as long as the clubs run, you just need AK@D in one hand or no @D lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|3for3: they got the latter...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: .. now :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wikner/Kamras: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJK1.pdf|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|roswolf: this may not play too well|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Yes, any other.  (But only in some events)|pg||
nt|panja: well, in that case, dbl must have been negative...and W should have taken out...or was the double penalty?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|woozle: four rounds of spades now will put South through the wringer|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi knows his side has a fit - if opps have a 9-card fit you are guaranteed an 8-card fit at least - but that doesn't mean you will find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might bid 4@S with the W hand once he knows about 4 card support since he has no valid defense vs 4@H except the trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can be defeated|pg||
nt|roswolf: the swedes on the first bd bid to 5@D for a game swing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3 bids on a 9 count now what|pg||
nt|panja: on B16, here, South is worried about @D control..|pg||
nt|panja: N should simply have bid 3Nt..but now, South is in a bind|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|nt|blum1956: A player of the team which is in best 8 will hardly lead a spade against 6NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the bidding could well go 1@s-2@s-4@S at other tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have seen it said that at expert level you should never lead pard's major but lead your own suit and this hand is a good example of why|pg||
nt|panja: Lev trying to put pressure|pg||
nt|panja: the youngsters might just redbl...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called by Upmark|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he called TD cause 3NT was bid after a longgggggg huddle by S|pg||
nt|3for3: does the slow bid demonstrably suggest 3nt by Rodwell?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the TD will decide that|pg||
nt|roswolf: in my view yes 3nt is much safer when pard huddles|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time i had received some messages from kibs about the 3NT bid after a long huddle|pg||
nt|3for3: it may be safer.  but it needs to be DEMONSTRABLY suggested...the law's words, not mine|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it again looks that americans cant deal with the multi:)|pg||
nt|dburn: no more than an in-tempo 3@c bid would, I imagine - but we are not the Director, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: well who does win now|pg||
nt|athene: west's defensive plan is very easy|pg||
nt|athene: just play spades and spades and spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: and get your three trump tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ilan Herbst went 2 off in OR|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would be better-off to double 3@S rather than bid 4@H, if he feels he has to do something|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think only -1 is likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: competenty done|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 13 tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lev seems to expect more from 1@D than East will deliver|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@H not very attractive for South (unless North had doubleton diamond)|pg||
nt|panja: it will be difficult to avoid 3 trump losers here...4@H doesn't look like a make|pg||
nt|rmb1: If anything, 4@S looks easier|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H should be a five-card suit in my opinion|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panja: NS seem to have similar cards in @H and @S...but @S are 33 in EW hands..so 4@S might have a modicum of a chance|pg||
nt|panja: @CK, @H ruff, a trump...what is the fourth possibility for the defenders?|pg||
nt|rmb1: @HA :)|pg||
nt|panja: oh well......if Declarer tries to prevent @C ruff, he can't ruff anything himself...|pg||
nt|panja: but he could get 3 Clubs, 3 Spades, 2 Diamonds, 2 Hearts for 10|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: he could not do that after his pd doubled 3@S, Bill|pg||
nt|jcomyn: CQ and H|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's probable that EW will come to 4@S on many tables either on its own or pushed, but not doubled |pg||
nt|athene: no i mean in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that would be for minors, denying 4@Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is rare that pd, when he doubles 1@s, does not have 4 cards in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: not so rare these days for the top players|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all assume pd has 4 OM when he doubles a M opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is true enough|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think E could antecipate some kind of misfit...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|jcomyn: but why does w keep bidding when he knows big hand on nhis left|pg||
pc|c3|nt|woozle: probably not, but leading from a nothing suit isn't completely safe either - can easily pick up (say) partner's queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody is very worried about the overtrick|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: levazza mean business by the looks of things|pg||
nt|jfaria:  9 tricks is quite a bit in this layout|pg||
nt|panja: I thought @CK was not a good choice....for West|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: ace and another trump lookes obvious as he wasnt in 4|pg||
nt|glen: should declarer have played @S ace then @s|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think doubling just says you don't have the offensive potential in hearts to commit to bidding 4 over 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not good for south|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment bill|pg||
nt|athene: so you  can still have auctions like 1@S X 3@S X pass 4minor pass 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: saying ok, we might want to play here, but we don't have to|pg||
nt|roswolf: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|MolvaM: greed?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an error by south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|MolvaM: actually he should want the @sK to be offside|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|panja: it might still make....unless @HQ entry is knocked out.So W must win @S, and switch to @HJ perhaps..let us see|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like two trumps for defence|pg||
nt|panja: no..@SJ and back next..that should be normal now|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|rmb1: Too many red suit losers|pg||
nt|panja: but for North's refusal to bid 2Nt..this deal would have been over long ago|pg||
nt|rmb1: Board 15 was flat in 4@SX+1 on the same auction|pg||

pc|s9|pg||

nt|roswolf: what 3@H would mean is a mystery:)|pg||
nt|athene: ok so with a 3nt bid and only four hearts, south would have done something else|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo responds 2@C on strong balanced hands with a 4-card major|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is to conceal the major if you don't have a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|athene: so if you respond showing a major then bid 3nt you promise 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: another kibber suggests they may use 3@S rebid by south as puppet to 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though NS are doing the same sort of thing|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd for -1?|pg||

nt|ntmon: when opps bid 2 suits and we look for 3NT, we bid the suit we have stopped |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 4+|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult salm to reach 6@D seems clearly superior|pg||
nt|athene: NS can bid lots of hearts but that will only encourage east to bid a slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok here is the CC for NS now: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJKeng.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be awkward for n/s|pg||

mb|p|nt|ntmon: but i agree .. NS on the way to problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart lead against nt is marked lucky east has 10xxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: getting to grand?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Losing @D finesse in 6NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: At the other table, North switched to a diamond at trick two, but chose the lowest...South, duly misled, led one back|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S will make if the defence foolishly try to cash @HAK, but not if they switch to a club to take out the entry to the diamonds, of course|pg||
nt|glen: thanks Hedy, typical swedish cc, very little blank space left|pg||
nt|dburn: Kokish hasn't yet managed to persuade Rodwell to overcall 1@s instead of doubling|pg||

nt|MolvaM: oh then @sA disappears|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is on in many denominations and level is difficult to judge too|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2 nt must be several layouts, otherwise I doubt W would enter tehe auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: the only problem with 3@C is that should not be enough |pg||
nt|ntmon: at least they're on the same wavelenght|pg||
nt|roswolf: advance sac taken|pg||

pc|s6|nt|hedyg: still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, now 4@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree hedy|pg||
nt|3for3: kokish basically believes there is no hand too strong to overcall.  Rodwell doesn't see it that way here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: even if misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|hedyg: anything is fine as long as they avoid 5@ds|pg||

nt|hedyg: Thomas thinks XX shows 3 @ss only|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 4 card fit and singleton @c he had other bids available|pg||
nt|roswolf: meckwell will probably have a similar challenge in the other room|pg||
pc|c2|nt|blum1956: clear pass for North on 2@s from my point of view, but Pszczola is a world champion which I am not|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could get 6 proverbial IMPs fine for that  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange not to correct to @s|pg||
nt|panja: the bidding doesn't really address this slam exploration...if W had @DQ instead of the @SQ, for example, it would have been a cold 6@C|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|jfaria:  Question is  if 2nt GF W knows NS will win the auction , so no point in telling where the gold is..|pg||

nt|roswolf: seems to gain a few imps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcarroll: they did well to stop below game, but even this is probably not going to make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: seems Madala decided they would take no @H tricks if EW played|pg||
nt|glen: and the cash out stops at 4 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: better cash the K@H now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder if n passes what happens|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ntmon: reaching 4@H X would not be problem on tables, where W passes and E opens with @S preeemt|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that may mean an imp to the israelis|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: they took all their tricks|pg||

pc|cT|nt|3for3: especially at NT!|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@D shows 1 singleton(unspecified) + gf i am told|pg||
nt|athene: some specs might be wondering why east didn't just double|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: there are two possible explanations|pg||
nt|panja: the problem is with the 2Nt bid....whatever 3@S meant, W could hardly have crossed 3Nt...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: finding h here will be tricky|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and game on|pg||
nt|athene: firstly they might play x as t/o of hearts (unlikely)|pg||
nt|glen: the modern style: bid five card majors, count points later|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= semi-forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT general gametrial..|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@d has some sort of play - not sure how good a contract it is|pg||
nt|rmb1: On 17, EW found a minor-suit fit 3@D-1 for 3IMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: secondly he just wants to emphasize he has real playing strength in diamonds so there might be a sac|pg||
nt|glen: the semi-forcing NT allows for opener, once having counted points, to pass to avoid trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: the term semi-forcing will always be a puzzle to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy +90|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus it is NOT forcing?|pg||
nt|hedyg: or just 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: whereas a lead-directing double could be as little as @DKQ10x or so|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: trumps 3-2 plus some work, I guess|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ntmon: much depends on methods now|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice no XX from Gino to show Kx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean: it is either forcing or it isnt?|pg||
nt|granguru:  correct|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1NT conventionally asks for point count? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: well your supposed to bid again if you have a decent hand very like drury without the guaranteed trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: , see above |pg||
nt|glen: semi-forcing is a terrible term, but was meant to distinguish between 1NT not-forcing limited to about 10 pts, and the modern style where it can have game invite values|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to pass surely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  doubt trading a plus for a a minus|pg||
pc|c9|nt|blum1956: not enough entries to make the @d s work and too bad @h distribution to crossruff effectively|pg||
nt|woozle: On the last board, Harding in the other room tried 3NT with the matching 4333s - down one also, but had chances for 10 in|pg||
nt|roswolf: brakes need to be applied now|pg||
nt|roswolf: simple auction|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is a terrible term indeed|pg||

nt|dburn: if North leads a heart, you have to commit yourself at once - if he doesn't, you have some breathing room|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: OTT|pg||
nt|athene: i guess one other advantage for 4@D over double is it takes some room away from opps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: 6@d by East may be better than 6@d by West for that reason, but there's not a lot the Swedes can do about that now|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: which red suit to try is the question|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: very lucky for NS|pg||
pc|d5|nt|woozle: A bit sad here that the third diamond will be ruffed with the short defensive trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: if Rodwell does lead a heart, he should choose the eight and not the jack|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: since he probably would not lead the jack from KJ|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, declarer may need to pick a black suit|pg||

nt|jcomyn: probably and then 3d forcing with at least 5-5|pg||
nt|hedyg: a Zia cuebid of 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: is bocchi teaching madala some interesting italian phrases at high speed now? if so, chances are, it was south's fault|pg||
nt|roswolf: another routine game hand|pg||
nt|glen: may see some italian science here|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it has some second meaning here. idont have a great hand and 3cards to raise you|pg||
nt|hedyg: and new leader|pg||
nt|3for3: shall they try 6@D again?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@H - only have to avoid 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: didnt work - it is good to see that the top players are also mere mortals:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|MolvaM: maybe the 4-1 trumps could bring some action|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could get feisty|pg||
nt|dburn: number 11 buses, these - you can't make six diamonds for hours, and then two come at once|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a nice unlucky game 4 EW|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: this looks better than the last one|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: or obsfuscation more like|pg||
nt|andyv:  good evening all|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: we have been seeing a lot of that|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Joao:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: XX= Hx(x) in @H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hey i am old enough already without taking a few hours off me. MORNING so|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: 2@C is the science|pg||
nt|panja: and play carefully..on @D lead, for example..you have to go up with @DA, remove trumps and hope @C suit gives you a trick|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|3for3: 6@H a good save here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C is a reverse inverted minor - it shows a raise to the two-level|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@c rather than 1@d was an interesting choice|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 4 Fantunes in 7@s|pg||
nt|dburn: now, if West can bid 4@h as a sort of "last train" or "Bluhmer"...|pg||
mb|4D|an| |nt|glen: natural or 16/17+ many hand types|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Pepsi bids only 2NT...he apparently has lower standards for vulnerable 2H bids than I do|pg||
nt|woozle: Seamon-Molson raises to say "yes, I did overcall vulnerable"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and the @S Ten is a vital asset|pg||
nt|woozle: I suppose she would never have raised without it|pg||
nt|dburn: ...which apparently he can...|pg||
nt|panja: and now, on @C lead by E.....this would go down|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@S splinter|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@D cue |pg||
nt|panja: right, and 4@D cue...so @C lead is automatic...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now thats aggressive but i suppose the 5-card suit is useful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice contract|pg||
nt|dburn: ...then East-West have a chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows his hcps, though not heavy , are good|pg||
nt|3for3: not sure what rodwell's double of 4@H was, but it will make it easier, as now east can show heart control.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Upmarks XX= 1st rd control|pg||
nt|jfaria:  played by the "wrong" side, S on lead could try a @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@h probably shows any 4 card without strength being a factor|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: actually E hand is rather strong in 15-17 range|pg||
nt|ntmon: roles home now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rolls even|pg||
nt|ntmon: rolls* :)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S was natural, usually 2@Ss, less than 8|pg||
nt|roswolf: for once i understand their bidding:)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think W will try the @h and will delay @d till the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: 3@H was the big hand, natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c either nat or any strong hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: according to the CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: then 3@H= strong hand with @s+@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: impressive bidding|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: good bid, that|pg||
nt|3for3: well done ew|pg||
nt|dburn: still, even if West had only bid five, East might have bid six|pg||
nt|andyv:  may lead @ss twice to hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now @s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: exactly|pg||
nt|andyv:  even dbl dummy can't see a way to strip the hand and throw S in to break the @d suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: i didnt expect this contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: should go -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you bid 1NT as W over 1@D?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: no i wouldnt|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm maybe that is a xfer too|pg||
nt|3for3: aha.  the save is found.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: h lkead d switch and another h but who would find that|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a natural raise you mean bill:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: "only" -5?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jfaria:  that doesnt solve the problem, but maybe  a favourable ending can be reached better that 50% chance after @h fails|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy can' take the @h hook|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: only four, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh only 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: cheap!|pg||
nt|3for3: 8 easy aces|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S must not try a @d now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club exit|pg||
nt|andyv:  he has 2 easy exits so no need to rush @d|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: it's good to see people raising clubs|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't happen often :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes of course they play transfers over 1@C -doh:(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh no|pg||
nt|andyv:  but what do I know|pg||
nt|jfaria:  MUST NOT :(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why do that with 2 easy options|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now there is a psic warfare|pg||
nt|andyv:  now West has to think since S wasn't being forced to lead @d that he may be underleading his Ace. |pg||
nt|jfaria:  Should accept the gift and let run to J?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think it's a gift|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: and bocchi-Madala found that defence in open room|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but could s be underleading the ace - unlikely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  as the cards lie it is|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|woozle: Fiona decided that spades aren't promising on lead, so tries a surprise attack in clubs. Pepsi is surprised, but not so surprised that he will forget to take his now ten top tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ntmon: well deserved|pg||
nt|jcomyn: led d first and then h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very good but i wont lead a s whatever else|pg||
nt|jfaria:  so Maha didnt gave credit to the duch jr|pg||

nt|blum1956: If North opens a strong 1NT, what will West bid&|pg||
nt|blum1956: ?|pg||
nt|woozle: North much too strong for a strong notrump...although at favourable I might open 2NT|pg||
nt|woozle: A strong notrump is the second best preempt in bridge, after 2NT|pg||
nt|woozle: Is Pepsi deep in the tank, or is this a coffee break?|pg||

nt|panja: B21, 3N does not make for NS..but they have 27 HCP..so they will try to bid some game...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@D would be a splinter we assume|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not want to do that with a singleton ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will brush the intervention aside|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be carnage|pg||

nt|roswolf: the auction in the other room was ultimately a phantom|pg||

nt|andyv:  but dblton in @s may slow him down|pg||
nt|panja: EW, of course, might create obstacles in their path and save them|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: and can add toit here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c would be invite + in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has sufficient defence|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just that he has nothing to say|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting problem for W|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Fiona, bids the routine (at this vul) 2S|pg||
nt|roswolf: to the limit for west|pg||
nt|andyv:  most prudent is 4@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: McGann takes the quick path to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: good judgment|pg||
nt|athene: does bocchi have to find the diamond lead for 500 here?|pg||
nt|dburn: trying to look like a man saving in 4@s|pg||
nt|panja: you mean board 18...6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe this is a hand t show invite + in @H and when d bids @H bid @s to show both majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: the noose tightens|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he has no 4 cards in any other suit than @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: some superbergen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm ok this looks as though bocchi made a forcing pass and now a slam try in spades which is surely a bit optimistic with his hand|pg||

nt|hedyg: why XX?|pg||
nt|glen: actual it is xxxx since previous xx|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely if Sementa had a better suit he would have bid it?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: now dbl?|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth has seen his sort before, though|pg||

nt|hedyg: as usual in your singleton|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: jaki wynik , wyniki w necie nie dzialaja |pg||
nt|andyv:  with 5 losers, it's too much to ask for a passed hand to cover 3 of them|pg||
nt|panja: 1@S seems like denying a 4 M...I am not sure it shows @D Suit ...|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S part of transfer-response structure to 1@C -  denies either major|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: good judgment again|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||

pc|c8|nt|hedyg: passssssssssssssss|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely no need to correct to 2@H!|pg||
nt|roswolf: might give preference|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well 2 imps to the swedes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: cannot be a forcing pass opposite what might be just invite|pg||
nt|glen: i still think ripping up cards will result in lowest possible minus score|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 8 card fit is better than nothing|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh no !|pg||

nt|roswolf: frying pan into fire|pg||
nt|panja: unlikey here though, EW don't seem to have any interesting option for discarding differently..|pg||

pc|d4|nt|roswolf: low trump to start|pg||

nt|3for3: a little chancy for cullin to double.  is meck is 0-2 in the blacks, might be cold, or his side could be making.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: just dont play @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@H was discouraging|pg||

nt|hedyg: seemed easier to disc 10@D|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|hedyg: if the 3@D bid had been gf, then it would have been a forcing pass|pg||
nt|athene: it's reasonable enough to play pass forcing if you showed at least game invite values and opps go to 5-level; 99% of the time they are advance saccing|pg||

nt|3for3: as long as rodwell didnt play @D all ok.  He had no reason to against 5@S undoubled.  If Meck had doubled, might have been looking for extra 200 point undertricks.  here the goal ...|pg||
nt|3for3: was a modest +50|pg||

mb|2N|nt|jcomyn: yes normal contract |pg||
nt|athene: but we just don't know the NS agreements here (or i don't anyway) :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  5-5 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: lots of hcp but not much chance of a slam|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: if west just holds up his @SA isn't he beating 5@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is, needs to hold up twice|pg||
nt|athene: he ducks twice - now if bocchi plays another trump he takes the ace and plays a fourth and the club ruff goes|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called , Ginossar think 5s was -1 |pg||
nt|athene: if bocchi ruffs a club himself, then west can simply force the south hand in clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: Tadeusz, did Gino duck the A@S?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe bocchi claimed 11 or something and west agreed without really thinking it through|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely though|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but fatigue does play its part|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that unlikely, only 4-0 @ss could beat him|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might well have played a @s from hand and claimed|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: Well i haven't seen , Bocchi has just claimed|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so we will wait, once declarer claims all play stops and you call the TD if you dont agree|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: We are waiting for decision |pg||
nt|roswolf: one fir the bulletin i think as do a few others!:)|pg||
nt|3for3: Is Upmark from the Steve Robinson school...All 5 card majors?  Otherwise, I prefer 1@D with this shape|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: me 2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2nt-3nt|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|jcomyn: might try 3nt here a behind bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be from the same family|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may not be so easy to stay low enough - that 1@s might turn out to waste space rather than save it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 1@D for me too|pg||
nt|3for3: it often does|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it seems that West can use relays of some kind, rather than have the auction start 1@s-2@h-3@d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|MolvaM: living thru this at the table is bad, but worse will come during scoring when you say minus 1400 |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt much superior|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c gf relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: but no difficulty bidding game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT= 8-10 ZZ with a singleton|pg||
nt|3for3: how do you find 6@D opposite Q@S, A@H, a @D honor and A@C?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they wont gey overboard either|pg||
nt|hedyg: ZZ points..|pg||
nt|3for3: or even less with better diamond fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: A=3, K=2 and Q=1|pg||
nt|panja: against, after the 'offside' 2Nt bid..it might be difficult to bid it with conviction....but likely, W will push it|pg||
mb|4D|nt|woozle: McGann has been there before - the big preempt putting pressure on NS in exchange for losing an occasional miracle slam|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s on the previous bd are playing in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: IN THE OTHER ROOM|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @h lead, N can get 3 @h tricks|pg||
nt|panja: that is, push it upwards|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is 2NT OK here ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: lots of controls in n hand why not 2nt|pg||
nt|dburn: but an initial 1@d would not have shown diamonds, and if East can show what he has by responding to relays, 1@s may lead to an easier auction all round|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c relay|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|woozle: Pepsi chooses to go quietly with his 17-count, fearing that a double will be pulled too often|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice judgment here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well it must be makable since NS took 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is dangerous|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it looks dangerous, but they probably have it under control|pg||
nt|3for3: this is one of the things that makes bridge hard to 'sell' to the general public.|pg||
nt|panja: ok to upgrade a point...even if your range is 20-21|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w will need a lot of the captain's coffee at the end of this match she wont be very sympathetic|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think W may be squeezed on the reds|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: "please continue to play, i will give you my decision"|pg||
nt|3for3: Even expert commentators have no clue what is happening|pg||
nt|panja: but I don't quite like the 2Nt opening itself.........it is an 'offside' opening, to borrow a term from football, too far too soon, a self-preemptive...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|woozle: If the match were closer, he probably would have acted|pg||
nt|blum1956: This is a partscore board besides McGann has another opinion))|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS play negative frre bids (NFB) after intervention, so S has extras and N accepts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree but prefer playing from n|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@C showing short?|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about @H?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hedyg: i am sure there is no bid to show both singletons|pg||
nt|dburn: I expect that by now West knows what East has|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@C was probably 5161 with a stiff DUECE of hearts :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: If 4@D is purely choise of games then East must bid 4@H,  If 4@D has slam try overtones surely East must bid on with a fit for both suits|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|granguru:  Duboin should have passed 1@H doubled but I give sementa the greatest part of guilt.for not passing 2@C.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Swedish experts think he showed exact pattern, thus wasted hcps in W hand|pg||
nt|dburn: people don't spend months and years devising these methods just to make life difficult for the commentators|pg||
nt|dburn: they do it because it helps them reach more right contracts than wrong ones|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jfaria:  but that would require a perfect dd play by N I think|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: h lead from w would n ot be nice|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lot of messages from specs about the last board|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree with that 1@HX probably not too bad|pg||
nt|granguru:  although 2@C is probably -4 |pg||
nt|glen: would make a fun "you be the judge" in the "the bridge world"|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ntmon: sure, @H better for defence but again .. not easy|pg||

nt|roswolf: i bet the score stands though - if the claim was accepted even though in error - thats it unless it was impossible to win the number of tricks claimed|pg||
nt|roswolf: which it clearly wasnt|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not so sure - declarer is meant to give a line of play|pg||

nt|hedyg: what did he do with the 2@ds in his hand?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what the jackpot coup is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ruffed both|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: we will be back at 14 30 CET, in 1 hour and 38 minutes|pg||

nt|granguru:  fortunatelly IMPs table doesnt punish you very hard after you already gave away a lot of IMPs in one hand|pg||

nt|panja: 2@S bid....I don't really like it..|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@C stopper ask?|pg||
nt|panja: poor suit..poor shape....no need to bid in a live auction|pg||
mb|3H|nt|woozle: 4S is cold|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s could be made|pg||
nt|woozle: with CA onside, diamond position, spade position and no diamond ruff coming|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@C may not be wise - who has the @S suit? probably partner, and is weak ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big finish for someone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it isnt lavazza|pg||
nt|ntmon: .. but this is not the case|pg||
nt|3for3: meck bought a nice hand from rodwell, who could have had nada.  K@D and stiff heart very useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes but has to get @Ds right|pg||
nt|hedyg: can not be more than invite by passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - this match (though entertaining) doesn't matter - but there are some fierce qualification battles going on in both A and B flights|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow morning with the Knockouts|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: frying pan into the toaster|pg||
nt|athene: nope, he tries 3 anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@C and @c switch might help|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that wont happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will accept!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: McGann tries 4H, down one or two on a spade guess with the club hook failing|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 2@s should be enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: everything is friendly|pg||
nt|granguru:  Italoswiss is a kib with very good memory|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now!|pg||
nt|hedyg: help the defense ofc|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: down one...Fiona surely won't try the SK now|pg||
nt|blum1956: -50 against -140 or -170 is a useful 3 imps|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ntmon: X should secure @C lead against 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 card out of 3 is on side|pg||
nt|rmb1: This club stop is not going to stand close inspection|pg||
nt|panja: luckily for NS..@HA is with E, and @DK, with West...|pg||
nt|panja: so there are 8 tricks..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: craziest contract of the week|pg||
nt|roswolf: north needs to avoid being endplayed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think he can get endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: endplay is unlikely because after ruffing a club and drawing trumps, west has no trumps left so a fourth club is fine|pg||
nt|3for3: i believe the higher you are, you get bonus in KO's, re selection of opponents.  Hedy posted the rule earlier|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10:00 AM CET|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is for teams 1-8, the rest are seeding as per EBL or WBF seeding points|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|hedyg: even A@H and @H is fine|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ntmon: prediction? abstain..|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed as it happens but still care needs to be taken|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: hope no children are watching|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|woozle: South could try for down two by ducking the first club|pg||
nt|athene: maybe @S6-@S4 is a subtle signal asking for a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: but bocchi can see it doesn't really matter i think|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|nt|panja: if W discards a @S..E will have to go up with @HA next trick..I guess|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
