nt|vugraphpl2: what a fascinating board for the beginning :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: a good bd for the german pair|pg||

nt|rcerreto: careful defense needed to set 5@c|pg||
nt|granguru:  plus all side controls E cant count 13 tricks|pg||

mb|1S|nt|runnerup: very weak opening or problems here also|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: which may well make with the diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Patience please|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Operator catching up'|pg||

nt|odysseus69: got the right players in the right seats - all we need is the right cards- we are patient tolerant sympathetic and understanding|pg||

mb|2S|nt|hedyg: Angelini is on lead with KQJ@S, he should find the lead|pg||

nt|stc: Flat 3NT because of friendly @ds|pg||
nt|rcerreto: playing a @c to the J he could have discarded a @c on the @d return|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto: but not after loosing to the 10|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: 15 imps is huge in 10 board matches|pg||
nt|hedyg: you can practically say the match is over except for a miracle|pg||
nt|jbgood: Fugleastad must be diciplined not to get too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: on the positve side, they have 9 boards to recover|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: while the opps twiddle their thumbs?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: and she is|pg||
mb|1S|nt|stc: even 4@h would make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: mini NT is at least credible and Syayman looks OK so on track now|pg||
nt|runnerup: destany was 4 down some misfif and 10+10  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT from North will confirm all is well|pg||
nt|rcerreto: Lauria wasn't in a forgiving mood|pg||
nt|rcerreto: after playing 6+1|pg||
nt|granguru:  another slam here|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|an| |nt|odysseus69: 3NT from South if 3D suggested diamonds + 4 spades|pg||
nt|rcerreto: this hand would be scary if playing "Gazzilli"|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@d more flexible?|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is scary anyhow|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 2@d denies 5+@hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: well, its a difficult life being a positivist :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but @h are stronger, moreover if you get raised you'd be happy|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well north did bid 3@C over 2@H led to 5@CX=|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I like better 2@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: i like it better too:)|pg||
nt|arigun: @s and @d are friendly to establish 12 tricks easily|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@S @DJ fall make it easy to win|pg||
nt|rcerreto: a knowledgeable spec tells me that 2@h shows a GF in @s with no singleton|pg||
mb|3S|nt|runnerup: 3nt +1 is my guess|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some communication problems- expect a club lead|pg||
nt|stc: good defense may keep dec in 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jbgood: better than 2@s anyhow:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: just because the communication problems dec has no choice but @ds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we can see 3-3 diamonds - declarer cant and will be a little nervous about cashing club ace|pg||
nt|stc: no need to cash the A@c, play all @d then AK@h and @H|pg||
nt|runnerup: i think also that 3 @d doent promice spades,just diamonds and forcing,because yu cant force otherways with only 5 cards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok as cards lie - everthing is ok- but if hearts 4-2 then danger of losing 2 hearts and 3 spades- |pg||
nt|odysseus69: however I agree that he shouldnt cash club ace|pg||
nt|stc: there is no danger to loose 2@h and 3@h because defenders has no communications|pg||
nt|runnerup: 26 was not enought to bid game in other table -so leaders will win this board -bacauce 9 at least here|pg||
nt|stc: 2@h and 3@s I mean|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: right -no danger when diamonds 3-3 |pg||
nt|jbgood: but difficult to make|pg||

pc|hA|nt|rcerreto: 2@s is where "gazzilli" would have likely landed you|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|stc: and with @d 4-2 he needs 3@h tricks and K@s on side|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru:  NS are beating the 1993 world champions|pg||
nt|hedyg: the ruff was a coincidence|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|stc: how many teams qualify for the Swiss A phase ?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: 3 :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: unusual to pass on South as in OR |pg||
nt|runnerup: ew has board this qwuite cheap--ns has 8-9 in majors |pg||
nt|odysseus69: most moderns bid 1S but maybe playing strong club|pg||
mb|1H|nt|granguru:  well in fact a kib rectifies me ..only westra was on that team|pg||
nt|stc: great result for EW in OR|pg||
mb|1S|nt|granguru:  Muller also a memeber is playing in the winning Netherlands red team|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|hedyg: yes but he must have though E has A@D not A@S!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: since S did not try a @d finesse nor to ruff out K@D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but whouldnt declarer have started the diamonds right away?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so why did he play small to the J?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: anyway. its history now and bessis got another 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was only obvious to us who saw all cards i think|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right hedy :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@c trial?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the play is so important at this level -you must take care in all contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  Fantoni Nunes also missed both slams|pg||
nt|rcerreto: hard times for Italian players!!|pg||
nt|arigun: another slam hand, for ns this time|pg||
nt|granguru:  players who used 4 suit transfers went easily to 7 through 1NT -3@C way|pg||
nt|rcerreto: it's unclear whether 7-4 is a two-suiter, really|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@H is an excelent slam|pg||
nt|arigun: makes even 7 and no way to go wrong since @dKT is onside|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: seems obvious|pg||
nt|granguru:  at the time they were the youngest team ever to win a BB|pg||
nt|stc: NS may cash the first 10 tricks here !!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade lead works well|pg||
nt|rcerreto: lack of control in @d should keep away from slam|pg||
nt|rcerreto: maybe not|pg||
nt|hedyg: how will they know?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jbgood: difficult to pass 4 NT:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: tis is 4- some down -is s! out|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: on the positive side there are 7 more boards to play :)|pg||
nt|stc: petit appel :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 down |pg||
nt|stc: but sry, only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: can he see it ?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|hedyg: difficult to know S does not have KQ@D|pg||
nt|rcerreto: even with the friendly @s layout...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well showing his shortage(if he could)may have worked better|pg||
nt|granguru:  what is going on here? |pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: the E hand is limited by not opening 1@c (16+)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but Kx in trial suit is a nice holding no?|pg||
nt|hedyg: you want to be in game opposite max 15?|pg||
nt|stc: if left alone, dec can make max 6 tricks, still -1|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I'm surprised, why not 4@d from N?|pg||
nt|arigun: maybe @c lead is problem to get 13 trick while playing 6, most probably 12 trick with a high percentage play line|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@D is a must with N hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: his partner did encourage I assume - |pg||
nt|rcerreto: and...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup: no but still down 1 |pg||
nt|rcerreto: you're still short|pg||
nt|rcerreto: aren't you?|pg||
nt|hedyg: better to show short on 2NT, then N knows AK@C are wasted values|pg||
nt|jbgood: a cue bid sequence may find a lack of di controls... this was too hasty by Kaninen|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rcerreto: come on!!!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rcerreto: what 4@c meant?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: yes but hedy's point is valid too -nv probably no big deal anyway|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|granguru:  Good lead by versace|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|stc: wd|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|hedyg: with 18+ for sure he opened 1@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play a multiway 1@c|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|stc: 7 more IMP|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes declarer had 6 but didnt take those so -2|pg||

nt|roswolf: that 2@H SEEMS TO BE A 1 SUITER|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a 2 suited overcall|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt and 5@d are ok|pg||
nt|rcerreto: let me say: undeservedly|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chilloncan: very aggressive reopening double there, at all green and facing a PH. risk-reward ratio not obviously in favor of action|pg||
nt|roswolf: a firm 3@D followed by a firmer 3nt!?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rcerreto: after all, there was a tiny chance that she didn't appear to have tested|pg||
nt|jbgood: 8-12 balanced|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@d|pg||
nt|rcerreto: with @s behaving, one stiff honour in @d would have allowed to make|pg||
nt|granguru:  agree|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: even if for t/o dont like dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: looks a flattie|pg||
nt|rcerreto: after elimination|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto: since Lauria-Versace are my friends, I think I can tease them a little :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|MolvaM: what would happen if smirnov could bid 4@h? would olech bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will never know|pg||
nt|stc: slam is not good but decent here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s will miss 3nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe olech should have bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: Piek wont let them play anyhow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so difficult for south to bid it from his side|pg||
nt|granguru:  Bubbo de Boer, westra, Leufkens, Peter jansen, Westerdorf, Muller, Jaap trounborst were the boys|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but it wasn't the case here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: may try 3@S -YUK!?|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Smirnov will..........pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL PROBABLY BUT EAST MAY THEN TRY A T/O DBL!?:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: imo when opps want to play in your 6 card suit you should let them :p|pg||
nt|roswolf: south knows he is being mugged but ...........|pg||
nt|hedyg: that independant caps key again Geoff?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both N/S players created problems and now its a guess if they can reach a makable game|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it has a life of its own:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or the devil made you do it? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south hopefully will bid soon|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a fraction better than spade finesse|pg||
nt|stc: slam needs K@s + @s 2-2 or some sort of friendly @c, about 40% I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|jbgood: can even afford 2 trump losers now since clubs behave|pg||
nt|rcerreto: several alternatives to evaluate|pg||
nt|rcerreto: we can see that any sensible line of play wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: would you start with A@S?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but he has to think|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I wouldn't but it could be right|pg||
nt|jbgood: @s ace and a small one is surely an alternative|pg||
nt|hedyg: ace in any case and think some more :p|pg||
nt|jbgood: but so many other ways|pg||
mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: hands must be bid on the same day that they were dealt :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@D is not a bad spot looking at the n/s cards alone|pg||
nt|hedyg: depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont play lower level lightners, only vs slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room 3NTreached with simple elegance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: disaster looms|pg||
nt|hedyg: the timid double by E in OR did not help the defense|pg||
nt|odysseus69: luckier to play from South when club queen would give contract|pg||
nt|granguru:  More amendments: Wubbo de Boer, Enri leufkens, Piet Jansen and ans|pg||
nt|granguru:  old italian systems 8and players) were extremely precise on the slam bidding zone|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: fielders choice almost|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the disaster started with south's double|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: now he runs to 5@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|granguru:  Hans Westendorf|pg||

nt|granguru:  NPC Jaap Trouwborst|pg||
nt|stc: yes, and hard to localize the unknown Q|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can make on diamond lead but dont think they will get one|pg||

pc|s3|pg||

nt|granguru:  ocasion*|pg||

mb|4D|nt|hedyg: 2@c relay i assume|pg||
