mb|p|mb|1C|an| |nt|toral5: fantunes here,lauria-versace,balicki-zmudniski.pleasure to watch them all|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi Sapan, Tom, Hedy ... and of course, Specs|pg||
nt|toral5: hi danilo|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ballebodk: i slow start 7cl/7d :) can they bid that ?|pg||
nt|toral5: hedy has an indepth idea of fantunes methods which will help us understand it more|pg||
nt|hedyg: our operator is Joanna|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: NOT a bad brd to begin with.just a grand:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|danilo1: let us check methods immediatelly ... 7 is percenage good |pg||
nt|hedyg: results and running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|danilo1: ... and 7NT best ... |pg||
nt|toral5: west will take control once @D are matched.2 singletons are super assets|pg||
mb|4D|nt|toral5: for a pair like fantunes 7nt is par|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ballebodk: all players in this room are playing strong club so lets se how they do against each other, maybe we non clubbers can learn something !|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/denmark/bjarnarson-askgaard.pdf|pg||
mb|5C|nt|toral5: u sure fantunes play strong @C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@c= 14+ nat or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|danilo1: ideal for key-card with specific Kings ... but I think Fantunes play someting different|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= gf with 5+@ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H relay|pg||
nt|toral5: ew play turbo|pg||
mb|5N|nt|hedyg: 3@D some more @ds|pg||
nt|toral5: dont think 4nt was rkcb|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|toral5: here comes the grand|pg||
nt|danilo1: @CK is vital card |pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|hedyg: yes after 4@s 4NT= even number of keycards (0 is even)|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: i thought fantoni with @C kj will himself bid 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: was trump q denied?|pg||
nt|ballebodk: maybe they miss DQ - i can be hard to se the 7-3 fit in D !|pg||
nt|toral5: i am sure nunes would be discouraged to bid a grand in a 7-2 fit without the q|pg||
nt|danilo1: he does not see 7-card @D ... West must have full control ... and he need to know @CK ... do not know how in their methods he shouls ask for it |pg||
nt|toral5: kxx with fantoni probably not disclosed|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know what 5@c was, i believe cuebid|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|ballebodk: its normally a little to much poker to bid a slam missing trumf Qxxxx - you will have some good moments but also some bad - so its the best strategi to have trumf Q|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|toral5: fantoni can be as little as kx @D and max|pg||

nt|alok_daga: starts with a bang|pg||
nt|alok_daga: A grand for EW,highly biddable|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT - easy to make, but to bid it - I doubt...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Hello everybody|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|alok_daga: playing IMPS wud prefer 2 bid 7dmnds|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1nt (tr 2 dmnds),acceptance,RKC,5NT 7|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|ady: 4@H looks ok for e/w   but can beaten if defence finds 2 diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D  makes if getting heart right|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 4@s or 5@c playable|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  do well in spades in spite of 4-1 split|pg||
nt|ady: sorry of course 3 losers in diamonds for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If 2 @D is a weak-2 - itÂ´s awful|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|alok_daga: 3spades=shortage,I assume|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 4@D seems to have stolen the hand|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I would not open 2H with 4 cards in the other major in 2nd hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And so much values in minors|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 4cl by East,now all Forcing|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 420 is par, use entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to finess in @s immediately|pg||
nt|ady: not the way to beat 4@H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jr7: Hi all - no names, but we are playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and the trump lead doesnt hurt declarer much|pg||
nt|alok_daga: hope bidding 6 does not go unpunished as a flat brd|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Fantoni,Nunes miss this cold grand?|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: are these the right teams/names?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ace of @H and a @h will be a deception for North|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: North needed to make more of his club suit in the auction|pg||
pc|s5|nt|davpro: Well done|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|alok_daga: this 7 ,playing teams by any standard shud br a push.F&N will be v upset I am sure|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ballebodk: an easy 4 sp where the sits shall be faul if you have to go down |pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1 entry to dummy for the @s finesse but np with Kx|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: will they bid it?|pg||
nt|ballebodk: that was the problem - to bid it :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: here neither long (3@C) nor shorth (3@D) trial get 4@S answer by pd|pg||
pc|dA|nt|toral5: south is min with the worst shape 4333 and 3d would have demotivated him with tht wastage in @D k|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW in CR bid the grand on bd 21|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh|pg||
nt|danilo1: still I like Asgaards trial much more than 4@S |pg||
nt|danilo1: especially NV|pg||
nt|toral5: so a 10 imp pick up in the 1st brd itself|pg||

nt|hawe45:  How to bid 3 NT - I see no way to that contract|pg||
nt|cenglund:  There is a risk to end up in 4 hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They probably open 1H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It would have more idea to open THIS West-hand with 2 @D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  It was a disaster for the South Africans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but I wouldÂ´nt do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  down 2 in open room   11 imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hans , Christer , Specs good afternoon to all |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but - at least in teams - declarer should have played @sA and @s10 before the last trumph. a good player can duck @sJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Meck opened 1D with the puny collection of high cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The problem is: You take these two first West-hands and compare. There is TOO much fifference - so partner never will know, what you have, when you open 2 @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@D opener , with diferent type of hands|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1sp 1nt 2hrts,2spades then?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: double by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  As predicted!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Hi all|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S play either straight forward 2/1 or transfer after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: N opened 3 @c and E made a nonleaping Michaels 4@d, so 4@h was wrongsided and got a @d lead|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT by South is not bad with spade lead from King|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes @H + @D behave well|pg||
nt|rmb1: Meanwhile South could X or bid NT now|pg||
nt|ady: not wild about 2@S from east|pg||
nt|jbgood: 500 in 2@s x - but that will not happen|pg||
nt|mamos: don't know geoffrey|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only + = both hands had the 10 of @S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 11 fast reicks for N-S  in minor |pg||
nt|cenglund:  True, but I am sure they would have opened 1H, but Meck did not allow that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that a @S-shift will kill 5 @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so fast... - these 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the 11 trick of @D can be a problem in this hand |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|kirp:  S takes ull by the horns|pg||
nt|kirp:  bull not ull|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Nice bid by South!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: ah they change|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and now 3 NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi mike|pg||
nt|mamos: Mahaffey EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least this will be fast:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead is obligatory, otherwise 11 tricks|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: you might have seen me playing with Olsen on BBO, his nick is James950|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's actually a regular on BBO |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nowhere else to go?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5@c also good|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: is club ace realistic lead|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S North?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No @S-lead also OK naturally|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jameslee 2: K@S lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 4@H will be more interesting|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 4@h:) at least on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: or duck of heart lead now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a clear duck! If declarer has @hAjxxx why not finess?|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the OR made a helptry thru a 3dmnds,here more logical,end result,same.Diff 2 bid|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: i think it is, this play only makes sense if south has heart ace|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jameslee 2: bad luck to see 11 and not make them |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|jbgood: perhaps N might have tried 3@s over 3 @h?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: yes jack was a mistake|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad luck for declarer|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: thats it |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he is the one that can see them not the others |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now -2 for 3 IMPÂ´s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - if he tries to make it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  This would be wrong with 3 @C together with 4 @D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade 10 prevent declarer from squeezing East|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other room 5@C -1|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: what are the best chances? enter dummy on @sA and play a small @h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: small heart from hand trick 2 looks fine|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cenglund:  Mahaffey may discard a spade and then declarer will prevail|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|alok_daga: clubs,33,hrts 33,Spade K inside ,nv brd not wrth the risk|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c4|pc|dA|nt|cenglund:  Now it's -1|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: upps |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rmb1: @C finesse and @H finesse|pg||
nt|ady: re hi all   got disconnected|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not missed much - declarer edging his way towards his contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West has a weak-2 - and East will keep the @HÂ´s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: see they chose the 4-3 heart fit     looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: More effective auction in OR|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up the hearts   but clubs blocked  so will hav e to lose 1 more|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|ballebodk: its nice to see our strongest pair in DK against one of the strongest pairs in the world - so i will look at with very red/white glasses :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: i think 3NT shows a hand with no ambitions|pg||
nt|toral5: 3c i guess was the old bookish extended stayman on which 3nt showed 4@S+4@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4234|pg||
nt|danilo1: no @H cue ... is Fulvio's hand safe for one more bid (with possible 12 at pd)|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

mb|p|nt|cenglund:  You could not imagine that he scored a trick in a side suit missing KQJ10|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kirp:  Precision @C by W|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S can make 3@h and E/W can make 3@d, but need accurate play to make 3@H I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed mike -straightforward bd|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: The OR (Open Room) in 4@S|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|kirp:  3@H looks ambitious on 43|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@d was suction|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @H or @s and @c|pg||
nt|rmb1: According to their card, South could open 1NT,  not sure why he didn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 3@D probably for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@h might be tricky|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 17 facing 14,a slam for the taking as cards fit.Doubt whether it will be bid|pg||
nt|fann4: E made a try and then stopped (he was facing a weak NT opening)|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|fabsayc: this 2@D is a new species, at least for me|pg||
nt|kirp:  curious to see how high EW get now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nobody will agree - but life is fantastic. if you open he North hand with 1 @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Similar situation now - not easy for E to drive to slam, though he has 7 controls, a doubleton and some good @D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: 2@s on the way to 3@d?|pg||
nt|ady: bad diamond split may beat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt!?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other table meck made the 2@H with the sing 8@C lead |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: but here bidding to finishe |pg||
nt|cenglund:  Multi is a dangerous gadget - for both sides|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S: I confirm my 5-card-suit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  E showed 5-7 hcp, so no strain on raise to 3@D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this just needs @C Ace onside, (or Ax @S?)|pg||
nt|alok_daga: wud rank F&N as 1 of the best in business they not having a gud day in office|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rmb1: Loose one @D and ruff one, could be just one @D loser|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may lose to the king and ruff one - that would give 10|pg||
nt|ady: yes    will have to take care|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks certain|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume the 1@S bid denied 4@H|pg||
nt|fann4: Only 11 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the nt game playing IMPS is ridiculous|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: sry Robin - not a deliberate copy:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  Not always true that 3 losers is 10 winners|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jameslee 2: now hw has confirm the 5@C also :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - at the 3-level...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos:  So Diamonds are 3-3 and soon declarer wil smile|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that the odds are on north only having 3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|STRIK3R: will find the A of @c and @s after 1@d, since 1@h was a freely bid|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks very good for NS, all games down and lots of values|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks on any lead, so a nice stop|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|danilo1: well, no missing slams in this set of boards :) ... next one|pg||
nt|ballebodk: but to be realistic - i dont think that the danish ew can do the job - otherweise i will really kipp with our flag !|pg||
nt|toral5: 3 slams in 4 brds is super|pg||
nt|hedyg: plus 5 teams from the B Swiss|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|danilo1: ... and all very good (percentage slams)|pg||
nt|toral5: this 3s will encourage south a lot|pg||
nt|toral5: 3s opp a minimum and south has much more than that|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls can be quite weak, esp by passed hands|pg||
nt|ballebodk: yes KQx in spade infront of shortage - do they play it as void i wonder ?|pg||
nt|toral5: kqx might discourage south|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@S will first not impress South, but when East bids 4@S (probable), he may visualise ruffing finess ... |pg||
nt|hedyg: he has an easy 3NT bid, if Fantoni passes|pg||
nt|toral5: but if 1@D promised @D,south might be encouraged|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: will Fulvio be on same wave - and not bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|toral5: most likely finesses IF needed will work after 1s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a 4@s bid by E is an invitation to slam for opps|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|hedyg: the man has played before|pg||
nt|ballebodk: i really disagree - 3NT ? - when you have a 9card fit in h - we are not playing pair !|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3NT! - best bid for South .. leave Space - and shows @S values|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: hey 3NT is not final, but it sure describes his hand which is what his pd is asking for|pg||
pc|cT|nt|danilo1: 3NT is not with idea to play there - just to show what he has|pg||
nt|hedyg: as i wrote above, it is not a final bid|pg||
nt|toral5: 3nt can never be good.interchange the minor king and 3nt is dead on a @S lead|pg||
nt|ballebodk: i think that 3nt should show at least 2 stoppers in sp, eg: KQ10x, EKx, and not 1 stopper|pg||
nt|hedyg: Sapan! of course N would never pass 3NT!|pg||
nt|danilo1: to note ... Excellent pass over 3@S by Fulvio|pg||
nt|toral5: why so?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Meckwell had a disaster in the OR|pg||
nt|fann4: Alok, I think your criticism is a bit strong - East knows they have 29-31 points between, so how risky is 3NT? I'd say virtually not at all.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|hawe45:  Easy defense against 6 @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: can make 3NT as the cards lay|pg||

mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: hardly recommended but brown would have done well to balance with double|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|ady: will hav e to drop honor doubleton heart in north hand   and bring in 5 club tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: X from East?  4@C seems too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: @S partial|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean: 6 @S|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the fact that the spade suit does not cum into the frame,I found objectionable|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kirp:  14-16 hcp, 3@C is simple Stayman|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Yes, because there is not way of pitching the losing diamonds|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@C = singleton @C not in the goos spot for N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @H...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Meck hates to bid bad slams, but he did not follow his principle on this one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very dificult not to bid 6@H here |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cue-bids might be invented these days|pg||
nt|cenglund:  RKCB is not the answer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but on info controls could be a good stop from N-S lets see |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South has bad values in the side-suits|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he could bid it directly or not |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: long think |pg||
nt|cenglund:  I suppose 3C shows minimum|pg||
nt|fann4: Slam is on here for NS, but the @SKQx opposite shortage looks wasted to South.|pg||
nt|fann4: This can go for 800 in 4@Sx|pg||
nt|fann4: Note E did not enter the auction in the OR|pg||
nt|alok_daga: but AQ10xx,shud appeal when partner splinters|pg||
nt|fann4: NS are clearly in a forcing situation, so S may pass.|pg||
nt|fann4: In which case N will likely press on.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Pass?his strength yet undisclosed|pg||
nt|fann4: S hates @SKQx for offense, but dbl may be a little premature|pg||
nt|fann4: Alok, 3@S is a splinter, forcing to game.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1hrt may be 6,he has 14|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Hi|pg||

mb|5H|nt|mamos: Dbl =?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This was the solution - now 4 @H and thatÂ´s it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Now he cant cue bid 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If he does, he might make the slam...!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: let,s see if S can help N to bid the good contract |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: stole it|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club switch now|pg||
nt|mamos: South squeezed out of auction|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Provided that 4C was not a query of some kind|pg||
nt|bagman: If memory servers; greco hampson play meckwell type precision where North was limited|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. Either a @d lead or continue with @s|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @c lead ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not easy to pick that contract|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kirp:  3N is fairly lucky to make, 3@C could be 5 CMS looking at 3@S bid to show 4@Hs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can he play on @C instead of @H ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  W showed @S if any 4 crd major, so @S lead is not best usually|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cenglund:  They are heading for same destination|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there they go to 6@H|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|kirp:  may play on @Hs |pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hate to - but have to! - syt it: POOR BIDDING AT BOTH TABLES|pg||
nt|hawe45:  say it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I don't think that this slam is unavoidable|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: i want to bid|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: this is what happened!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kirp:  small @H best now, but @D finesse works|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: considering his middelcards in @c, playing one round on @h's was more attempting, needed to try @c's if first @h failed?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Team Angelini picked up more imps in board 2 when the other room bid 3NT instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|kirp:  ad hope NY couldn't take 3@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: a fair punt, but didnt work out|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes, I guess J@H onside is higher %age than @C 3-3? |pg||
nt|kirp:  3@S lead certainly gave defense little chance to figure out what to do|pg||
nt|kirp:  if @H J is onside, then has time to test @Cs and if not 33, then @Ds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D finesse|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt he need @d finesse in any case? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  They are "buried" in their conventions!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fann4: Yes, I think they play a lot of Meckwell stuff.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cenglund:  Both N-S pairs thought that it's a big minus|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbgood: needed to safety play diamonds to win|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: likely not much difference here since NS on for 4@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  still only 8 trix with J@H onside|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to get 3@d tricks, so @d finesse is very much needed|pg||
nt|kirp:  S should have continued @Hs ,then needed @D finesse|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|jameslee 2: we,ll after all (no score)  we shall keep 12-12|pg||

nt|hawe45:  11 tricks possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4nt?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|rmb1: Convention card I have says 2H natural|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: 1@s from north show 3-5 @s's they open 1@c with weak hands with 5-5 in @c and @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: transfers first|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  2@S can buy the hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: S is happy to pass this as i would guess that 2@H denies 3 or more spades|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fann4: 1 off on the bad trump break.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: where does the 8th trick cum from?5hrts+2 dmnds|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to play the @DJ from dummy after winning @HK hoping to be able to get a spade or a diamond later|pg||
nt|fann4: There is no 8th trick - he will lose 3@C tricks.|pg||
nt|fann4: Now that he is going to be deprived of a @C ruff he should probably win in hand and play a @S up to the K|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: W is very happy now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@s confirm the 5th @s|pg||
nt|kirp:  Surprised that W did not act over 1@H|pg||
nt|mamos: South is going to have a peek I'd guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: a diamond lead would give it|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|jameslee 2: diferent bid other table 3@S here 2nt to end in 3nt |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer's main hope is to score 6 hearts and 2 diamonds; with hearts 4-1 he needs something nice to happen |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: x@H lead could come from S |pg||
nt|alok_daga: played xledummy it will make|pg||
nt|fann4: You are wrong. It cannot make.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|d2|nt|jameslee 2: not much comunication for the 2 @S finesse required |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C play could duck by S |pg||
nt|bagman: East needs to play a spade in some point to prevent @S-@D strip squeeze; if the defense cashes their 4 tricks and fail to play a spade, W is strip squeezed|pg||
nt|fann4: And easy to see - losing 1 trump, 1@S, 3@C and @DK|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Excellent score for the team Apteker|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: this is Bridge when one has a few options can go rong :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both of them (East and West) might have bid better. East has no hand for NT-play, and West never showed the 6th @S|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They bid the more sensible 4S in the OR making|pg||
nt|fann4: The defence would have to mess this up really badly to end play themselves.|pg||

pc|s9|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: spec gives me a 6@D cool contract comment |pg||
nt|bagman: In the 2nd position the preempt should be quite pure as there's sort of 50-50 chance that the good cards are held by the partner|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|ady: 200 to Netherlands    could only make 140     east with defensive values  might have doubled 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And with 400 in 5 @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - East ducks the first @C for sure|pg||
nt|fann4: So 10 imps probably to DEN|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jameslee 2: true only 1 discard for the 4th @H not enough for 12 @D|pg||

nt|ballebodk: but to all your specs out there - watch and learn - even the greastest can make severe mistakes so there is still hopes for us normally mortals :) |pg||

nt|mamos: wild hand |pg||
nt|mamos: s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another IMP possible here for Apteker|pg||
nt|fann4: These days most experts prefer to open a weak 2 with a side 4 card major, if it's not too good a suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Again EW might try 4@S|pg||
nt|fann4: But I far preferred the pass made at the other table.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|oosmanb: Any endplays possible for 10th trick in 4@H? |pg||
mb|2S|nt|oosmanb: I doubt it, so NS would do well to stop below game|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C was 16+ artificial|pg||
nt|fann4: Wow - a disaster for EW in the CR, ending up in 4@H in a 5-1 fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 61% for NS on board 6, nobody made 3@C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but with a 10 card fit, vulnerable, can Fjaelberg put the brakes on |pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H can make if W does not switch to @S when in with the A@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: How? even if @C are stripped East has 4th @d to exit?|pg||
nt|kirp:  8@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|oosmanb: Ah right, |pg||
nt|jbgood: guess X shows 4-5+ spades?|pg||
nt|ady: down 1  would sedem unless a slip|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1C-P-1H = S so I guess this X is a transfer to S as well|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 4@h now|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A less interesting board |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Overtrick is easy: 2 x @H - and a SMALL @D|pg||
mb|3S|nt|oosmanb: Well spotted Martin|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: might get to 4 now|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Fantoni,Nunes reach a 4hrts on a 5 1 suit,miss their 5 3 fit,a off day for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: S could never hope to buy the contract in @hs - so perhaps xx in stead of 2 @h to indicate a high @h honor might have worked better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  That's what happened in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: So yes important for West to break up endplay, and he will too, has 1@S bid to help him|pg||
nt|kirp:  I said 'can make', timing and defense needed to help|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: E knows that W has short hearts and might even hope a heart lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|alok_daga: Assume pp 1sp p 2nt=4trumps+a stiff.AKx treated as a 4card in the OR|pg||
nt|fann4: In my book, the W hand is just a 2@S raise over 1@S|pg||
nt|bagman: Here declarer can cash the @HA and cross ruff 8 additional trump tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fann4: Can one make 10 tricks on the layout?|pg||
nt|bagman: GIB can but E's going to cash his easy 9 :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  South can see 23 HCP - so not much for an entry in North|pg||

nt|jbgood: see?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kirp:  I would guess it unlikely to make, knowing EW is very sound on all aspects of game|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: looking for  an imposible @H ruff underlead from AK@D |pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: e/w do well in hearts and could make 10 tricks if clubs not played early|pg||
nt|jbgood: much easier to defent if N knows about the heart king with prd |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: non spade lead was a disaster for EW here, but can salvage with heart return knocking out north entry|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so two @H tricks for defence eventually|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: sheesh|pg||
nt|jr7: good decision not to play 4@H - 9 in 4@H and 9 in 3NT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|oosmanb: Yeah seems like a good play to me, certainly the first one that occured |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: lucky for them K@H is off  side and 5@d doesnt make but 4@H?|pg||

nt|vugraphpl7: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 100%|pg||
nt|kirp:  he was hoping NS would duck k@C and then he could switch to @Ds|pg||
nt|rmb1: 13 back. 5@D played by W in OR|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1100 lets see |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 15 IMps |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: are in play |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: for a 27/26 end |pg||
nt|alok_daga: the play of the cl Q was poor spade Ace,hrt Ace cah,spade|pg||
nt|alok_daga: cash|pg||
nt|fann4: Sorry, I meant 9 tricks, for 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: instead of about 95%|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Potential for Jans to pull some imps back then|pg||
nt|jr7: 4@H in N/S|pg||
nt|ady: swingy srt|pg||
nt|jbgood: same opening in the OR - but W preferred 5@d|pg||
nt|ady: set|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thanks to BBO and EBL for organising.  Thanks to operator.  Thanks to David and Jon|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT is no safe winner|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: Yes, playing the K works if AQ is not on same hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: 4@S in Ø/V only 2 down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jameslee 2: specs are on favour of a 3nt -1 on @D lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT  even on a heart lead    but unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so not such big swing |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But how about 2 @H DOUBLED...|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Last brd of the set.Thnks 2 fellow commentators,specs&Monica for the gr8 vugraph|pg||
nt|bagman: Hampson might jump to 3@D|pg||
nt|bagman: if he ever gets to make the 2nd bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kirp:    think tahts what he was hoping for|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this might be 14 for a tie|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: actually cost more than 20%|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  doomed on early heart play|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: probably only 12 though|pg||
nt|fann4: Maybe, because of the limited non-opening of 1@C, but that should still end things.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: They've bought the hand|pg||
nt|ady: well stopped    |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cannot fault e/w for not playing 3NT|pg||
nt|fann4: No, these guys don't jump on hands like this.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vbman: -200|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D x ? how many off  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  12 IMPÂ´s - at least|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: -1 |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jr7: 1@C is strog, 2@C = diamond|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: that makes 700  for 12 |pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: now north needs to hold 10xx of hearts or another disaster|pg||
nt|kirp:  this looks straightforward|pg||
nt|ady: thx all    interesting set|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jr7: strong|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Should be only 1 down|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: and a match 26/24 |pg||
pc|h3|nt|kirp:  9 or 10 trix|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: wont take long|pg||
pc|h8|nt|oosmanb: Last hand of the segment, but LOTS more bridge to come!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Thank you to the organizers, and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|kirp:  ciao|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hade|pg||
nt|jbgood: some really astonishing actions - great show|pg||
nt|ady: well Aptekar got to 3NT in OR   surprising   so finishing a close match|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fann4: So a likely flat or 1imp board - meaning an excellent result for DEN, who are in 6th position in the A Swiss right now.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: GN all|pg||
nt|bagman: the trump lead was quite standard after the auction; with hearts 3-3 the spades go away for push|pg||
nt|fann4: Whereas ANG are 28th - remember the top 27 go thru, with 5 teams from the B Swiss, to the round of 32.|pg||
nt|fann4: For live updates on a brilliant site go to     http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|rmb1: More back for Apteker.  EW have played well and perhaps deserved a bigger margin|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|oosmanb: Next segment in 15 mins|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club jack is going for another swindle|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but dubious since now both players guard clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: not much was right for EW here   a chance for the Polish team to get a few imps back |pg||
pc|h5|nt|bagman: Now declarer has the option to pitch either clubs or spades :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hT|pg||
