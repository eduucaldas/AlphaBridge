nt|mcarroll: 2@C in Open so probably a flat start|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: ruff and discard never obvious|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|grebrof: nothing wrong about this line|pg||
nt|mamos: It is a tough day   lots of boards - slow tempo  - moving around - distractions - some pairs not in contention - others desperately fighting   - it's not surprising that it is ...|pg||
nt|mamos: varied|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: EW have no need to regret giving in to Diamonds  they could make nothing|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: hi Hans|pg||
nt|mamos: Ns will bid 3NT   in any language|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed but they didnt look as if they would find a major fit|pg||
nt|yke:  W should have played low and East should have throw the K under spade Ace, not that easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee here we go again with ultra-light opening|pg||
nt|yke:  but it's only for an overtrick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how many clubs|pg||
nt|yke:  nice hand :) |pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD 4@H easy but SD impossible to make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And on a @D-lead - overtricks?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Hans|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: i like that|pg||
nt|yke:  I don't like 3NT, with a void|pg||
nt|jcomyn: banking on a d leade|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Rather easy boards to start with here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hi/morning(sunshine up here North|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jaapfr: pls who is Thomas operator?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: N is Thomas|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 3@s is not an underbid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially vul very aggressive stuff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NOOOOO|pg||
mb|2N|nt|danilo1: Double -dummy 3NT ... but guess would not find @DK|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: will they get to 6 here ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If so - 6 @H D is free for 1100|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 the 1400 and 1 IMP|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult to find out, how bad slam is|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D= 11-18 nat or 11-15 4 4 4 1, 1 4 4 4  or 11-21 2suiter with @d|pg||
nt|jbgood: the closest we get to a system "bank" is that of Ecats I think, but on occasions like this we surely miss a place to find whatever CC we want - to which all pairs playing ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: internationally should contribute|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos: defence to 4@h not trivial|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: playing 4@s wouldnt be either|pg||
nt|grebrof: missing the AK of trumps, not always fun|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well ca ruff and h ak|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: see the one earlier missing ak of trumps slam|pg||
nt|mamos: S probably has to rise with @hA  and play Club|pg||
nt|grebrof: I actually played 6@hs with single A vs my Ps single K|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes that would be great!|pg||
nt|jbgood: a challenge for the WBF|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jaapfr: gm Hans|pg||
nt|hedyg: though i am sure if i spoke Dutch somewhere on the NBF site...|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: good afternoon |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: cue bidding no doubt|pg||
nt|grebrof: you know - the multi|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Team NONACO might be M-onaco|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: hello|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|yke:  what about double with the East hand? I think one of them will run|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: yes the Slam missing AK of trumps was the result of RKCB and a 5@s response which pinpointed two missing KC when the agreed suit was @h|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: It is, sry for that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Z = Zimmermann...|pg||
nt|danilo1: mini NT ... North is still not giving up slam ...  ... need not to go over 4NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|grebrof: can give ruff?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: J10xx wouldnt happen to me|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: uses will bid this in two bids but maybe we are oldfashioned. They take 9 bids to get to the most unobvious contract u ever saw|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT was 11-14|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks as if the 19 ciount aint finished yet|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in open also 5@CX-3 I presume|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is going to be expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Piekarek forgot system|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: oh i hear in open 5@H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eamongall: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html    open teams running scores seem up |pg||
nt|yke:  but maybe to 5@C :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|grebrof: very nice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a real quare one - p opens 2d multi and you have void h and 7 spades - what was my partners suit|pg||
nt|grebrof: @s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep. One of my many most embarassing moments|pg||
nt|eamongall: good evening kacper |pg||
nt|danilo1: well ... if South decides to open .. in nat. system, may not be so easy for North to stop ... here ... mini NT and relays should have advantage ... seems North not using them|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now 10 bids which comes from opening weak|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so french a lot of imps to start with|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some 12 imps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 13 can|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|grebrof: my P had 6 @hs and 3 @s after my multi and jumped to 4@s - what was my suit?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big question around - who was the idiot who played in 2s+5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thast makes things easy |pg||
nt|hedyg: oh!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|danilo1: in Open room .. 3NT made bd one ... after East's Dble ... and @H cashed ... West already exposed 5Hcp ... so @DK found|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y a good player does not make more than 8 tricks in @H (a bad player at least 9 or 10):)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: should bid 2nt no 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he not show 11-15 5+@Ds?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: 2nt is with 3s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  Small @D = no isk|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: nice @C duck|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  risk|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jbgood: Hi - Helgeness were in 5@c doubled|pg||
nt|hedyg: because 1@H/@S over 1@d can be 3+|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sunsamvar: wd have given problems if @S was 4-1|pg||
nt|fokal: seems it was better to play a @c after the first @d|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: bonjour Oliv :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven tricks |pg||
pc|d5|nt|fokal: only because AK of @s and KQ of are onside|pg||
nt|fokal: bonjour|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes very lucky|pg||
nt|fokal: of @h|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably 11 tricks .... @S 3-3|pg||
nt|fokal: S will eventualkly get squeezed on AK of @s|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|jaapfr: the table turned 90 degrees with the clock:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer had a good idea where @CA was there because West had passed in 1st seat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I don't think 3NT can be beaten:  hearts and spades all on-side|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jaapfr: 2@S and 3@C can be made but not much higher|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If they had bid it, no doubt the Dutch selectors would have had them off the team in an instant|pg||
nt|paulg:  for their peeking skills if nothing else!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|an| |nt|jaapfr: legitimate peeking I presume|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|bjacobs: hard to stay out|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  I am getting lots of comments on the Dutch team for the Bermuda Bowl, seems like there is someone who would leave out every pair|pg||
nt|paulg:  No fun for their selectors|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: I see the Germans did bid 3NT on board 16, but misguessed the play|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the 11 -39 score had imo nothing to do with not good bridge (I saw equally few doubtful things of both teams)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South has some choices here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he will elect @CJ:) my bet|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess so ... still a heart could be the winner|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or @CT:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North might have bid 2@c over 1NT, but perhaps that would be conventional for the majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A heart is necessary if declarer has AQxx-Q10x-Kxx-Axx or the like|pg||
nt|bjacobs: this is why South is cogitating|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think the lead marks declarer with four diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well then, AQxx-Q10x-Kxxx-Ax ... same effect|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too dangerous declarer can get rid of @C losers by developing the @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  now @cJ to ask for a heart, since he would normally have led the jack from @cJx|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right ... the club play was probably percentage|pg||
nt|paulg:  also the @dA denies the king, but Paulissen wondering if it matters|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: anyway, the dutch is making a good fist of this comeback, on a strong of "little" hands|pg||

nt|hawe45:  And here: NEVER a Multi - bad suit, can play in minors|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Never|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eamongall: strong NT and transfer and probably play 2@S ... or as it is 1NT |pg||
nt|jcomyn: another light opening wont work|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Probably in board 2, 6 @C is the best slam|pg||
nt|eamongall: personally I would attempt to play 2@S but I am not in Poznan |pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mamos: i cannot see any way to make 4@h on this board even if the defence fail to get a Spade ruff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i am not bidding 2c on that hand to let opps have a cheap bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lucky West - North could (should) have waitet one round|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: an interesting - and unusual outcome of the Multi, opps play in opener's suit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But anyway - this board will be played in @S at most tables, but...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: without 2@D endresult could well be 4@H down|pg||
mb|2S|nt|grebrof: 3nt doesnt make either|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Yes, Grand against the odds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 NT should be the contract, I suppose|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eamongall: Now there is a slim 1@S but the preemptive value ovr 1@C might make it worth it ...and being a passed hand |pg||
nt|eamongall: the combined 13 count is bullying the 27 count for now |pg||
nt|eamongall: but 4@Hs is a comfortable outcome for NS |pg||
nt|yke:  in the south hand ofcourse|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way to get to @c fit i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  It is easy for us oldies to look at the South hand and sneer at opening such a barren 11 count and attribute this to the failure of the Slam but all the modern experts play like ...|pg||

nt|jcomyn: n does not meet the 20-standard|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s maybe strength showing|pg||
nt|hedyg: the CC says 2@s would be a transfer, here to 2NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: a xfer, weak or invite or strong, f1..|pg||
nt|hedyg: xfer to 2NT cannot be weak so np to bid 3NT as N|pg||
nt|jbgood: a creative lead - and prd had 5 @d - a pity they werent better|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: yes its something about 2@S but I dont hear exactly|pg||
nt|hedyg: well it is the equivalent of a 2NT bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: taking into consideration that 1@c can be (11)12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|jbgood: so N accepted if S had an invitational hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 14 for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: we are waiting for the TD?|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  North with @C Q-J - OUF!|pg||
nt|eamongall: that is possibly a full imp ... 340 against 370 |pg||

nt|jaapfr: but makes 1 or 2 ot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  he would be nervous in 4@s too, to be fair|pg||

nt|bjacobs: East is sort of endplayed on lead, although you might go down if all the major cards are offside|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||

nt|fokal: yes|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fokal: but here both contract will make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bessis has a standard problem - he can set up his suit, but has no entry|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: In these situations it's usually best to set up the suit, because then declarer gets scared and might do something wrong|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and if not playing it declarer knows the same:)|pg||
nt|fokal: he will have to play the Q of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: because dummy has no entries|pg||
nt|fokal: but here it won't change a thing :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: play @S Q coming does he dare :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, and declarer will just have to hope West has @SK, and still take his 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still he will do that yr brother|pg||
nt|fokal: or doing the @d finess which works too :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: he doesn't need all the spades: he has 3@C, 2@S, 2@H, 2@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it's true - he could  go back to the @D hook|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @SQ he will|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: Einarsson - Efraimsson leading still - now at 58% Ovidio at 2nd with 55% (roughly)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like reopening Dbles 10/11+ last position over 1NT (especially strong NT) ... they may gain a lot ... and loose a little (in teams, ev. -180 is not that tragedy)|pg||
nt|jbgood: scienfitic approaches not the strongest point in this partnership|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will he duck the d or play for a being right|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  Or without @C-switch, when you get the @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S Ace...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: amazing how it begins to tighten up to this extent|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty Kacper and all specs|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: more imps to Bessis|pg||

nt|paulg:  perhaps he is just a bid good for 2@s in that sequence, but not good enough for 2@h?|pg||
nt|fokal: besides, with 15 , would you bid only 2 @s ? not very convincing either|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it's certainly an in-between, but I cannot see how a 1NT opening "solves" itr|pg||
nt|fokal: with a stiff Qand only 15 I guess not|pg||
nt|fokal: I think the choice is between 1NT or 1 @c then 2 @c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, if you insist, then 1NT.  1@C then 2@C would be disgusting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: despicable, disgraceful |pg||
nt|fokal: or 1 @c then 2 @s but it's not very good either|pg||

mb|d|nt|grebrof: ok, weaknt|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 15 + 14|pg||
nt|danilo1: South knows pd has @S (EW did not bid them)|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: 6h|pg||

nt|eamongall: 7@Hs is different but clearly hoping for 2 @D tricks |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jcomyn: ouch dont like 1h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  Yes, that was what I meant with unusual|pg||
nt|jaapfr: awfulfirst 9 boards for Dutch with regard to the SCORING|pg||
mb|4H|nt|grebrof: new boats have arrived - here NS at 13th and EW at 12th|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IN OR, North opened 3 @H - OUF!!!|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Make that 10 boards Jaap :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in 1st hand 3@H was a crime until which year:)???|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 hearts and 3 aces makes an easy 9 in 3NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: same number of tricks in @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: nice @S fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @S - not my cup of coffee|pg||
nt|danilo1: pass or 1@H ... guess question for everyone ... I prefer pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hi Oliv|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: congrats from BBO to her - and also with the win yesterday|pg||
nt|eamongall: sure |pg||
nt|mamos: pass|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Olivier Bessis|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: yea|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes a timely non vulnerable 2@S ... or madcap 3@S would stir things up severely |pg||
pc|c5|nt|grebrof: nice stop in 3nt|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Hoi are you the brother uncle or grandfather:)?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Do not show Olivier "les 7 SA-BESSIS!"|pg||
nt|fokal: on the @s return, N might put the 9|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: some one should explain to these players you are allowed to pass now and again|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  I would prefer 2 @S (weak) on this South-hand than on the 6-4 hand, we just saw|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fokal: I saw it already , I did say "YEAH !" indeed :)|pg||
nt|fokal: lol M Bessis is our father|pg||
nt|hawe45:  GODfather?|pg||
nt|fokal: :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you can never get ruffed in NT - as far as i know|pg||
nt|eamongall: with no interference this is just going to meat and spuds to this very strong EW |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|mamos: well maybe 1@h a reason for this outcome  EW  seem likely to make  3NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: except the 3@H bid on 9 and the 5@H bid on 2 I did not see any doubtful things by the Dutch (saw any else?)?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This will probably be the only table to bid 7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|mamos: it might not of course |pg||
nt|jbgood: or is there a way to find the 10th??|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos: there is an amusing symmetry about the Black suits|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores all tournaments http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: not all - I dont know why but there is no one link|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fokal: @s from E avoid the declarer the trouble I was talking about|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|nt|grebrof: yes - sometimes its like a picture this game|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Can even handle trumpd 4-0 - by North|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|grebrof: well..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So we get closer to 9 tricks, nice defense (for declarer)|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - some difficult discards may give W a chance|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|nt|jbgood: but may be likely to play for clubs 3-3... then|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: home and dry now - S out of exit cards|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s2|nt|grebrof: looks like no squeeze - claim?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: He certainly played it brilliantly, ducked the club, then ran 6 hearts, and it does look like South couldn't hold it together|pg||
nt|fokal: N should have played @s, probably|pg||
nt|bjacobs: at trick 2?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: great stuff|pg||
nt|fokal: yes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2N|an| |nt|fokal: but maybe it's still not enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it is enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: By the way, GIB did say that declarer needs to WIN trick 1|pg||
nt|fokal: hehe |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So presumably the squeeze works even without a partial rectification of the count|pg||
nt|fokal: so a @s return is enough :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it would seem so|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think this will prevent it being in the bulletin|pg||
mb|3C|an|fit  and good hand|nt|fokal: yes :) espially if the dutch win|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if|pg||
nt|fokal: 3@c is game forcing raise 4+ @h|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@d now?|pg||
nt|fokal: une seconde|pg||
nt|fokal: désolé je commentais|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sort of "unusual over unusual"?  3@D would have shown spades?|pg||
nt|fokal: sorry|pg||
nt|fokal: private|pg||
nt|ritong: yes bill|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ritong: hi guys|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi henri|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not desole but mb realistic lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: hoi h|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: &"=13|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think all Thomas can do here is bid 5@H|pg||
nt|ritong: tom is compelled to bid 5@h|pg||
nt|fokal: sry again|pg||
nt|fokal: yes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@D good safe|pg||
nt|fokal: maybe more|pg||
mb|5H|nt|fokal: his partner's pass is forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: everything in his hand yells both contracts can easily make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hard to do more with that club holding|pg||
nt|paulg:  I doubt if North sacrifices, it may not be cheap and they might be beating 5@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North considering, but he deoes have some reasonable defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if N X S to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on @C lead @S switch ??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for -3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then|pg||
nt|fokal: A of lead then @s to make it -3 in 6 @d|pg||
nt|fokal: As of @c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps North has this dilemma - he doesn't know who is bidding to make and who is saving|pg||
nt|fokal: yes :) always the same issue|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the other hand, the opponents did not double 5@d so it is unlikely that they both have club length making a save more possible|pg||
nt|fokal: well the 3 @c bid is a hint|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: it is, unless a sort of psyche|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is the vulnerability that makes this such a problem, as -300 is not a great score whether you are beating 5@h or not|pg||
nt|ritong: michel will ruff everything possible|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: then, down to @ss|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Declarer has a cute play for this contract ... to eliminate the clubs and most of the diamonds, then play the @DK and discard a spade|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: beauty|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|h3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: nice, bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now draw the trump, ruff the club, and play @DK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: again a beauty Bill:)]|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: If North plays ace, you ruff it, and take your spade play|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: I'm not sure it's totally safe though|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|dJ|pc|h7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaapfr: 100% enough?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, I think it was ... if North covers @DK with @DA, then you can cross back to hand with a trump to start the trumps from there|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: start the spades|pg||
mc|11|nt|jaapfr: yy so your line 100%|pg||

nt|grebrof: many play 4@s which is 420|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They let 4 @H win in OR on board 7, so big victory now - allthough the slam-swing against|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: last bd and short break befor next round|pg||
nt|mamos: if so 1@h may cost NS :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: last bd today|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: thx and see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ils ont de veine:)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: indeed |pg||
mb|1H|nt|yke:  another slem, but about 50% with a heart lead|pg||
mb|2N|an|!C and !D|mb|4D!|nt|jbgood: he will rebid 2 NT i think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so a slem is a dodgy one then|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: live scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|jbgood: if he gets a chance|pg||
mb|5D|nt|fokal: West did not show his @s with this 6 count 4333 with xxxx in @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d short|pg||
mb|5H|nt|grebrof: 3nt again?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Dutch De Wijs-Muller bid 7 NT|pg||
nt|yke:  well in 6@C you can try Ace of clubs in case the king is bare and then diamond finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d would be unusual vs unusual|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 2@s - 3@s?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so if you nplay in nt you are vul and in spades not vul - interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: good bid :)|pg||
nt|fokal: seems correct in my opinion|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a lot of French reactions|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Sry|pg||
nt|fokal: ah :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok: vive la France:)|pg||
nt|fokal: I was thinking that he might do something on 2 @h p p :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d was -2 on a A@C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Very good lead this - also|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will take the Ace - and play a @D, IÂ´m sure|pg||
pc|cK|nt|danilo1: probable 1NT by South ... so will probably end in 3NT |pg||
nt|snorre: Helgemo open this hand 1NT. Brekka think it is a 18-19 NT...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yke:  I think it is too strong fro a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: Kvangrtaven will regret his 3 NT now - wrongsided and a possible slam miss|pg||
nt|snorre: 3NT north isn't much better than 6@c...|pg||
nt|yke:  but played from the S hand, 6@C is as good as 3 or 4NT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least -1|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@S|pg||
nt|fokal: in 2 @s they lose at least 1 @s 2 @c 2 @d and 1 (or 2) @h|pg||
nt|fokal: so it should be a push|pg||
nt|fokal: If N had redoubled , S might have X 2 @s with 3 Aces and 3 trumps|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|mamos: quick hand?|pg||
nt|grebrof: not so quick in the start|pg||
nt|mamos: will be good for EW because inevitably some pairs will not find NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yke:  I don;t like the 3NT call|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i think 3nt is a dreadful bid|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably -1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yke:  agree|pg||
nt|snorre: practical bid: 13-15, no major|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sunsamvar: Great work by our operator Kacper from the venue|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: doubt it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: small s|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, good game again|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|grebrof: good auction too|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sunsamvar: Great working with u Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very logical - and good - from East, The @H Queen proves, that Wests @H need no help|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South should have covered the @S Queen - West i the dangerous hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sunsamvar: Tx to all the specs for ur comments and for watching|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphpl9: thx|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but whats the hurry please tell me that|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fun discarding|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: i do not like a X (N sold his hand already imo)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: XX|pg||
nt|fokal: But I would agree with tom's decision; no aces , no quick tricks, and not so many points after all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|grebrof: discarding IS funny|pg||
nt|fokal: the 4 of @h should deny the K|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hear next board Dutch in 7@H|pg||
nt|fokal: so therefore probably shows the @c king|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@H made|pg||
nt|fokal: oh, can't wait for that one :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is 2@S-1 so tell them operator pls NEXT board:)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: sometimes I really want :)|pg||
nt|fokal: let's try to figure S trouble|pg||
nt|jaapfr: players can not know but we and all specs can see |pg||
nt|fokal: playing @c is bad if declarer has the king|pg||
nt|fokal: playing @h shouldn't be bad anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Jeff|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: sry, priv|pg||
nt|fokal: so even if his partner's cards seem to show the @c king, there is no emergency|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  At the other table West led he @H 10, so East cintinued @H...|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphpl9: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess S understands she has to hold @hs at least now|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|nt|danilo1: in OR ... North never mentined @C bd. 26 ... so it has been  al ittle difficult for South to find 6@C|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and finally Tx to the organisers, BBO and Roland for bringing this vugraph to us|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Monaco has been solid in this room and are deserving winners|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: yes fair point|pg||
nt|fokal: yes, ruffing one more @c and discarding on the K of @d was more safe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but irrelevant|pg||
mb|2D|an|a) weak 2!H/2!S b) GF !C|nt|bjacobs: Perfect contract for the Germans ... the Dutch will need to take the lead on some other hand|pg||
nt|ritong: jansma has a choice|pg||
nt|fokal: making 5 @c is a good result for NS close room|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: 2@d ?|pg||
nt|ritong: a typo i guess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess 3NT (ugh) also makes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what have the germans to with this:)?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|fokal: yes, yo're right :)|pg||
nt|fokal: but openents might bid 4 @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ritong: ah, not a typo|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ritong: a sexy gadget|pg||
nt|fokal: indeed :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C more elegant than 3nt imo|pg||
mb|4C|an| |nt|paulg:  if you put all the balanced hands into your 1@c opener, then you can play a lot of gadgets over 1@d as opener is always unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: not that easy to make 5 @c, if you ruff 2 @s for example, you can't finesse the K of @c|pg||
nt|fokal: so it seems you have to set up @ds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: tricky|pg||
mb|4D|an|optional RKC|mb|p|mb|4N|an|max, with lots of things|nt|bjacobs: Declarer didn't set up the @D in the CR ... he actually endplayed East|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@d looks like keycard for clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: keep in mind that paulissen is facing a gf hand with !xs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Kickback / Redwood?|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps not looking at 4N|pg||
nt|ritong: @cs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4NT = 2 keys, no @CQ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: we're guessing, but it makes sense|pg||
nt|paulg:  but he only has one key plus a void|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh sorry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: guessing poorly|pg||
mb|5C|nt|paulg:  i made the same mistake .. looking at the @dK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fokal: 5@c by S goes down on lead : 3 round of @d|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yeah so did I ...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3?|pg||
nt|fokal: here it can be tricky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But South cleverly didn't bid clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not daddy to lead|pg||
nt|fokal: you can't play @d or you lose 3 tricks (including the overruff)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: So apparently there's a thing called "Optional Blackwood" ... 4@D was Blackwood, but 4@H is conventionally: "I'm weak, I refuse to answer"|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: dealer goes to the toilet!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That would convert 4NT back to the one key-card response|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: sorry declarer|pg||
nt|fokal: so on @s lead if you cash 3 trumps, they will play @s each time they gain the lead in @d|pg||
nt|jaapfr: same|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here|pg||
nt|paulg:  crunch time for the Dutch, I doubt he can afford to go down|pg||
nt|fokal: it seems it goes down on @s lead|pg||
nt|fokal: what does gib say ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what does East discard on the second and third trumps?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is what happened in the CR ... he pitched 2 spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he will make this|pg||
nt|fokal: oh ok|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N will|pg||
nt|bjacobs: now, declarer couldn't be forced in spades, and East was eventually endplayed in diamonds|pg||
nt|fokal: I get it now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If he pitches a diamond, then the diamonds set up too quickly|pg||
nt|fokal: he can afford a diamond, but then he is doomed on the 3rd trump|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, not sure|pg||
nt|ritong: an ottlik hand|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: 2 players and the BBO operator lacking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what if he pitches one spade and one diamond?|pg||
nt|ritong: east squeezed out of his " idle" @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: play will be resumed upon their return, in 1 or 2 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: oh, they are back|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what will thomas lead?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: x@S|pg||
nt|fokal: ok|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: ow|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's what ifear better this :)|pg||
nt|fokal: a @d and a @d beats the contarct I think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: plsssssssssssssssssss :)|pg||
nt|fokal: sorry I can't see how to make it on a @s lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nor can I, but GIB can|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think what happens is that East will get squeezed if declarer runs all his clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: after ruffing 1 spade|pg||
nt|fokal: no :'( |pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i was referring to all specs saying @D lead down (yes if played by SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS:)|pg||
nt|ritong: this lead seems to be good for declarer, but what should he do?|pg||
nt|fokal: @s lead, ruff, A of @h and 3@c s|pg||
nt|bobholl: how about double @H finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then back to @HQ and two more clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4 card ending: declarer has 1 small spade, 1 small heart and 2 small diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: dummy has 2 diamonds and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East is strip squeezed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: very nice Bill|pg||
nt|fokal: yes, if E discard another @s he is endplayed in @h to give the K of @d|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer can do the same thing here, but "simplest" is to run the heart, and risk returning to dummy with a second heart|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So now it gets interesting|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now i start to believe down 1\|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think he expected a lead from @hJ8xx when there should be a 'safe' spade available|pg||
nt|fokal: doesn't S have an entry issue here ?|pg||
nt|fokal: gib says no so I guess not :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: right, the entries are mucked up for the line I described above|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb it is close but i preferre4d the @H@H@C line|pg||
nt|ritong: paulissen has a feeling he plays for staying alive, and he is right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess he's going to have to work some sort position on East, but for the moment, I don't see what it is|pg||
nt|fokal: here declarer can make on @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: if he goes down, it is virtually over|pg||
nt|fokal: playing 3 @c and @d|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East wins and plays a spade|pg||
nt|ritong: the only info he has is this nebulous @h8 lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think you are okay with that, win @sA and finesse diamond .. you have spade ruff and @hK for entries|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, ruff the spade, play a second diamond, win the second spade with @SA, and play 2 more clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: and the @c K on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: you were right Oliv, draw trumps and play a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|fokal: he can even make the @h finesse would say GIB :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You get the strip squeeze back|pg||
nt|fokal: that's why gib says that a @s now makes, I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: of course, this is all double dummy.  In real life, declarer is facing a completely different problem|pg||
nt|ritong: he s not even sure @c K is onside, by the way|pg||
nt|paulg:  the problem with drawing trumps and playing diamonds from hand is that you will probably face a diamond guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: will play @D to K i fear |pg||
nt|fokal: since E didn't bid 1 @s and didn't lead @s I think declarer has a good idea that @s are 6-4|pg||
nt|fokal: with point in East|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think declarer is budgeting for @CK onside here|pg||
nt|ritong: if he trusts the lead to be a doubleton, he assumes @h Jxxx on|pg||
nt|fokal: other wise, W would have bid @s on 2 @d|pg||
nt|bjacobs: even red versus white?|pg||
nt|fokal: so he might get  everything right|pg||
nt|bobholl: gert jan can think 20 minutes about such a play :(|pg||
nt|ritong: but the @h 9 on the first trick would be bizarre in that case|pg||
nt|fokal: but it would be wolrd class bridge|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess North has not shown four hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: ok, we all agree ... there are several ways to make it, and even more ways to go down?|pg||
nt|paulg:  just said he would play in 2@h if partner weak with long hearts|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|c6|nt|fokal: I agree|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think seeing all four hands is a small advantage in this case|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|ritong: he s gone for two @s ruffs, seems|pg||
nt|bjacobs: he'd test the second trump first, wouldn't he?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it's easy if clubs are 2-2 he can claim|pg||
nt|fokal: now only way to win is the strip squeeze, using E as an entry for cashing the trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yeah, I don't like his chances|pg||
