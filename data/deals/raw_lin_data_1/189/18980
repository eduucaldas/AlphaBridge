mb|4D|nt|rodal f: A funny strat|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Vlad|pg||
nt|mamos: big struggle for the vital 7th trick here|pg||
nt|hajru:  Something looks weird here, board 1 usually has N as dealer|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: N should start biding!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: there is some problem witht vugraph lins|pg||
nt|hajru:  and I don't think Wrang-Ventin play for Mahaffey|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: i wil start new transmision soon|pg||
nt|barnets: correct names please|pg||
nt|hajru:  Welcome back, that fixes the problem of the dealer. |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: morning all|pg||
nt|sfranchino: lot of voices is always a problem |pg||
nt|mamos: except perhaps this lead gives it|pg||
nt|peachy: running scores in both SF matches  http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/osfrunda1.html|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but dbl must be easy for N now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Agreed|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ntmon: a match between 11th and 12th team from current standings |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Please give them a flag each, operator|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Mike and everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: south wanted to bid @h noe ew in 2!-looks like 3nt must be bidden now|pg||
nt|rodal f: What elso now?|pg||
nt|danilo1: with @CK good played ... surprise @S lead may beat .. but guess @H lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi for u to Markku:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: if @S lead .. declarer must leav twice .. than switch to @H |pg||
nt|runnerup: so this can be beaten,but probably makes|pg||
nt|danilo1: Sementa knows South has trap pass over 1@H ... so may well chosse @S|pg||
nt|mamos: stiil loads of work|pg||
mb|5H|nt|paulg:  Results for the first match in the round-robin can be seen at http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi all, welcome back, This is Round 4 in the roundropbins, Open Teams. 15 groups of 8 teams each.|pg||
nt|peachy: 10 boards per match|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this should be fascinating|pg||
nt|rodal f: If E bid standard S have a easy X for the safe income?|pg||
nt|runnerup: defence still tested|pg||
nt|hajru:  It looks like 2NT was some heart raise and there is some confusion over X |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kista: An easy 6@s for ns|pg||
mb|6S|nt|peachy: Current standings in each group after round 3: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||

nt|jcomyn: hi Krishna|pg||
nt|pelu: fast 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bernix: good morning and welcome everybody to round 3 of semifinal A of the European Open|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where are they going or is this real bidding - i cant believe it|pg||
nt|daman: Welcomeback everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: both had extras, so the preempt did not deter them|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  finally we got to a std 3NT|pg||
nt|pelu: all card well placed = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT was limit raise or better|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C was an artificial GF|pg||
nt|jcomyn: they find the 5-3 clubs fit and then head for the hills|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: hi|pg||
nt|barnets: clubs was much better|pg||
nt|peachy: To watch more than one table, http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   Then open a new browser window for each additional table|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mamos: although after the Spade lead declarer had some chances in practice it seems inevitable to play Hearts and fail  -2 looks normal|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Gary|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|danilo1: really 8?|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: Sorry|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Zia|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: this is one of our 2 close matches|pg||
nt|hajru:  It looks as if W intended X as any 2 suiter.  East then should have a 2nd place to play after 5@c|pg||
nt|daman: the rewind|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: also 3Nt in OR|pg||
nt|danilo1: really?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but he has 3 of p's bid suit i still dont understand it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru:  funnily if  opens the hand (1N) there is a good chance to arrive at 6@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  could be worth a couple of imps if it is played by West in the other room|pg||
nt|chmitty: I must say that I never met the pair sitting EW ... not been introduced to Mister West nor Mister East|pg||
nt|ntmon: improved|pg||
nt|dburn: well, South decided to play for 4-4 spades, so the defence won't be tested any more|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good to have you here, Zia|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: Hi John & Vladimir|pg||
nt|suketbombi: remarakable performance by Keyzad and Venkatesh playing their 5th round without any rest|pg||
nt|pelu: same bidding in OR (1@H here = @s)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|runnerup: no test at all -so 5 @d only game if all awake but this was too easy beaten|pg||
nt|rafizain: texan aces have been the surprise team here but if i remember they did well a few years ago in another european|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: This will slide a couple off, but small gain for EW anyway, undoubled|pg||
nt|mamos: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oqfrunda1.html  for running scores in the 4 matches   -- all to play for in the second halves of these matches|pg||
pc|s9|nt|barnets: looks down 4 to me|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bernix: so first blood to monaco|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rafizain: any table?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk5: This table :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You don't like the players? :)|pg||
nt|daman: a nice way to start the 2nd half (only half forNS) with a baby slam|pg||
nt|rafizain: the best contractr here is 6 hearts but hard to get there after 1 sp opening|pg||
nt|rafizain: as bad spade break might doom 6 spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: the running scores are great Mike|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just going to say this will be very painful|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: just fantastic aren't they|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kibs like to know who EW|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: if he had ducked a couple of spades, though, that might have been a test|pg||
nt|daman: claim   top tricks|pg||
mc|12|nt|granguru:  but thaa|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like -3 to me for a push the hard way|pg||
nt|peachy: push, actually, I forgot the spade ruff|pg||
nt|suketbombi: also the same result so it is a 27 bds contest from here|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, they won Bronze & Silver previous Euros|pg||

nt|rv: tough for new partnership to settle in 6@h here, JM might have thought about giving 6@h as choice of slams, was worried Swarnendu might take it as 3rd round @h control for GS|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C not available by roddy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: such delicate auctions always difficult for new partnership|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: cue usually sets last suit as trumps - but was obvisoulsy ambigous here - particularly since S showed the spade Queen...|pg||
nt|bigtrain: even meckwell has an occasional maximum for the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|nt|rv: is Swarnendu thinking of doubling here?, can't be after partner's pre-empt at these colors?|pg||
nt|barnets: x is winner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: I wouldn't have doubled, maybe that is why I am sitting at home:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: but this lead is not best|pg||
pc|c5|nt|barnets: and gives up at least a trick unlucky|pg||
nt|jbgood: spade lead might lead to W having to play club from hand eventually|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hard to critisize a @C lead|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|h2|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|barnets: 2@S in closed|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rv: JM's action of bidding 2@s and Swarnendu's option of doubling 3@h would hardly be choice of too many experts, this shows luck does play a part|pg||
nt|barnets: I like the  X|pg||
nt|barnets: east is likely to be weak and communication diff|pg||
nt|barnets: if not for the lead at least 500|pg||
nt|barnets: acyually 800|pg||
nt|rv: even now 500|pg||
nt|jbgood: i like your point, Barnet:)   |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|barnets: yes still 500 after the unlucky lead proves point|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||

nt|granguru:  another potential slam here|pg||
nt|granguru:  a better one thou|pg||
nt|pelu: only need to play @s-siut with no loser|pg||
nt|granguru:  still it  needs @s 2-2 or stiff honor in E and a good guess|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi all|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, it would not have been a very difficult test, it's true|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The Aussie bidded best here by NS as well as W pressed at 2@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ntmon: straghtforward game on  21 |pg||
nt|kista: Texans did well in two euros earlier|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sfranchino: 4@h against 5@c ?|pg||
nt|pelu: the @D-lead against 4@H will give S some work in 4@H - need to take @DA - 2@H and play@SQ - noe East endplayed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@H  wud be bid alright|pg||
nt|hajru:  We are playing 2 14 board sets. 1 now, the next one starting at 18:00|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi all - as every time there are problems before the first match - players has to find the right table and so on|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3NT or 5@c both cold here|pg||
nt|chmitty: not an easy bid for North|pg||
nt|chmitty: Can our operator disclose the names of the players sitting EW ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: oh yes :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: ty|pg||
nt|peachy: He might go for the practical 3NT if this were MPs, not so sure IMPs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5c for ns if they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: not with odds - but better that a "Roland-slam"|pg||
nt|bernix: part score battle again. can NS buy it in 3@h ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all, gutten morgen Bernard|pg||
nt|bernix: hi danilo|pg||
nt|pelu: do u agree in only 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Pleased to see that South has a name, but I think I'll stick with 'South'|pg||
nt|granguru:  exchange black QÃÂ´s and it would have been a rock iron contract|pg||
nt|rafizain: 2sp will end auction|pg||
nt|psyck: They have been figting back after trailing quite a bit several times this year, as usual|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: we begin with a possible slam|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: Rodwell did open the N hand with 1NT???|pg||
nt|chmitty: Difficult for South to imagine he has so many defensive tricks !|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will North x now ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hope for him there was not too much of an hesitation behind the screen|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S might have doubled. Vul versus notvul, N had great expectations of making, the colors tell he was not preempting|pg||
nt|chmitty: I agree 100% Raija|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t understand leads from Hxx|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but dont think it was roland as another kib suggests|pg||
nt|rafizain: he shd lose 3 spades 1 cl and 1 dia|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: Hi John|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 clubs best here 6nt /e also|pg||
nt|sfranchino: 3@h i think is not a bda bid makes problem only for the pard|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR 1@D opening and 4@H passed out|pg||
nt|sfranchino: or 1@h or 4@h|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|granguru:  I would have done it if @CK|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think many in the field will bid this one|pg||
nt|chmitty: he must protect the score of his pair|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pass outs are becoming rare birds|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|granguru:  NICE TO see u again Raija |pg||
nt|granguru:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Convention cards are not available so unfprtunately we cannot explain bidding|pg||
nt|granguru:  at NT or any Moysean|pg||
nt|chmitty: Next door bidding started 2@s (E) 4@s ... NOrth thinking|pg||
nt|danilo1: nice 6@C ... if by mistake in 6@S - or even 6NT (E) ... all will make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell lead rusinow from 4+card suits vs NT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|pelu: and I would open 1@D 100% (=4+@d)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North has distribution and they have a lot of controls|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@C cue X @Cs|pg||
nt|granguru:  N could have xx to show second round ctrl|pg||
nt|pelu: when N open 1Nt then Meckstroth has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|pelu: RD = 1. round control|pg||
nt|granguru:  but then it is more complicate to show @d ctrls|pg||
nt|granguru:  RD is second if 4@C was first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmmm and a 6-3 c fit not too imp;ressive|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c instead of 2nd x would have worked better|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: close contract|pg||
nt|barnets: another club best|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: @H-lead - 2x@s and @C finess|pg||
nt|psyck: same bidding in other room though|pg||
nt|mamos: North has a good source of tricks so goes on over 2NT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: ok that makes life easyer for dsecl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: although 4-2 foirtunate lie in h|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's standard in Poland overcalls are limited, so strong 1-suited hand should X first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course but no 2nd x for me|pg||
nt|ntmon: but after preemptive raise, problems arise|pg||
nt|psyck: if 1345, i'd have Xed 2nd time too, thought 4@c was clearer this hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and deters the @S lead|pg||
nt|mamos: will make his adventurous game |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|granguru:  If I would be forced to guess  1@C strong 1@S=4 ctrls 2N nat 19-21 3@D @C ctrl no @D ctrl|pg||
nt|bernix: phantom sac|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: 4 obvious tricks for defence|pg||
nt|kista: 2@s will just make here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  It is much easier for us, but can South have less than this to make a slam try with no heart control?|pg||
nt|danilo1: ideal def. is - first @H for A, than @DK and third @D ... guess not easy for Adam now ... since North cann well be single @D |pg||
nt|bernix: but it doesn't matter if he cashes a 2nd @d before switching to hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: would probably play better by N but good chances|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ntmon: i'm inclined to 4@C too but no strong opinion|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|peachy: lots of work in 6NT, not impossible I think, but rather aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  a passive lead is a must here|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm thinking E will lead club, that would be my choice|pg||
nt|granguru:  it seems 3@d was nat as N went on to 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: but I am not in Hurd's class of player so we'll see|pg||
nt|granguru:  most passive is @D|pg||
nt|granguru:  the @D10 is a critical card (not here thou) so W has 4 critical suits|pg||
nt|psyck: sry folks, have to switch to another room, c ya|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: 6NT by East would not be a mistake - that contract is 100%, while the defenders might meanly ruff something against 6@c|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6NT is surely best .. by mistake I meant 6@S :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 2.best contract reached|pg||
nt|jcomyn: in trouble maybe|pg||
nt|barnets: can guess daimonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ntmon: see u later :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: slan|pg||
nt|sfranchino: barrage at 3@h in second position when pard dont bid makes problems only to him|pg||
pc|d8|nt|granguru:  N S expects that @S dont behave...|pg||
nt|bigtrain: more likely to make 2 then go down i think|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: do u know players where cuebid are 1. control - to day 1. or 2.? back in the 50'es in US they only cuebid Aces - and lost to Italy every time :)|pg||
nt|peachy: that would have been my last choice of leads, Jxx nearly never right|pg||
nt|granguru:  I am wrong E leads|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  E has a clear @d lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: Versace will not escape 800 |pg||
nt|danilo1: difficult (almost impossible for Giorgio to correct to 6NT ... he does not see 7-cards @C in West ... and after @D cue (probably single) - cannot risk|pg||
nt|barnets: dec can guess @D|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|danilo1: excellent defense ... now even -2 possible |pg||
nt|bernix: caiti must use his only entry to dummy to finesse in @cs rather than @ss|pg||
nt|danilo1: did not matter for -1, I agree Bernard|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Operator, West is  Caiti|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|psyck: Rodwell balanced on 2@s & they got to 3@hX other room|pg||
nt|kista: Rodwell in 3@h X |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Sridharan is one of our regular commentators, psridhar, fine player, sharp analyst|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: better lead a @C earlier I think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: perhaps there is something in the bidding that we are not privvy to, which induced the spade lead|pg||
nt|peachy: To watch multiple tables, http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php.  Open a new window for each additional table.|pg||
nt|ntmon: Lev carefully watching spots|pg||
nt|pelu: @D3 could have worked better|pg||
nt|mamos: is squeezing his own hand now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: a creative preemptive in the OR|pg||
nt|hajru:  making now. For a small gain to EW|pg||
nt|barnets: 5 imps|pg||
nt|khaled_m: Aces win|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5 imp gain|pg||
pc|h8|nt|granguru:  :) true|pg||

nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it is a good idea that the very first control is A (or KQ)|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|granguru:  not vul sorry only 22!|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, by the end of tha match, maybe I learn some French by osmosis :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and me some English|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the usual 4-1 break|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - you'd need a relay method to reach 6NT by East with certainty|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR W in 2@SX|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at least the sa is right|pg||
nt|sfranchino: 3@h revelead very bad bid|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chmitty: 2@d both majors ?|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4 IMP for Krajewski - 5@D on  1 doubled|pg||
nt|buddyshah: And  play  from dummy  Declarer had play   to keeop it to 500|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like NS came here to bid|pg||
nt|kista: 3@h X will be 500 for Texans|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: seems so|pg||
nt|peachy: Long time ago, we used to call those bids Polish two suiters, nowadays there are several variations and names for them|pg||
nt|peachy: Hungarian kib tells it is 5@h-4@s, or 4414 or 4405, 11-15HCP|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2+@D 0-15 :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that might put paid to a d contract by ew|pg||
nt|psyck: @cQ lead may have helped dec other room, but still will not end well for dec vulnarable|pg||
mb|2C|nt|granguru:  would like to hear your arguments...I am open minded :)|pg||
nt|bernix: this looks like a run-of-the-mill 4@s to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: So Lauria will probably reject the option of double ... which could be effective in front of a @s lenght|pg||
nt|bigtrain: XX = 4+@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|granguru:  kibz might enjoy an expert view on the matter|pg||
nt|paulg:  I don't think cue bidding first and second round controls equally makes a huge difference to bidding slams, a lot of it still comes down to judgement|pg||
nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W probably expects E to have a yarborough|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Zia's profile (rafizain) is blank, but trust me, it's the real one, the one and only|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think the italians beat the americans so often because they had practised partnerships and better bidding methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  being an  expensive deparment players try to reduce judgement and increase accuracy|pg||
nt|granguru:  good advice...on all contracts under 6NT|pg||
nt|peachy: There are no convention cards available for us (or anyone) so appreciate kib help in interpreting bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought they play transfers over 1c|pg||
nt|dburn: may not be so easy to stop these in a partscore, after all|pg||
nt|danilo1: if to play 4@S ... West should declare|pg||
nt|dburn: but they managed it - this is a partscore|pg||
nt|runnerup: true you cant guess in teams -solid 6 @c ok -here only 3 spades  makes  |pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe Duboin didn't actually pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must surely pass|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bernix: 3@c sounds like maximum with 5-card suit doesnt it|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk NS play 1NT 15-17 (or at least did before) ... 1@C is choice I believe (agree, 6 controls, no soft values, hand better for suit contracts)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@S by West may make ... no chance if by East|pg||
nt|suketbombi: funy part both play 2@S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: funny|pg||
nt|pelu: India 2@S at both tables - :) |pg||
nt|suketbombi: this is a big loss for texans|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  agree paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand has another debatable point .. how do you break transfers?|pg||
nt|pelu: too difficult to start a cue bid if only A, a cue is an invitation for slam and often u will miss that - and bidding economy also tell u to start with the lovers cue bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Since there were so many small boards in the first half, I was hoping that all the spectacular stuff had been saved for the second half. False hopes...|pg||
nt|granguru:  from 6NT on the strategy changes|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1NT will be played on most tables|pg||
nt|barnets: good pass|pg||
nt|bigtrain: every level increases the undertricks by 1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: so very good pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and even one is no pushover|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@CX in open n/s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is -1 without breaking a sweat for the defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 toptricks for defense, but not easy to take them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i dislike showing a weak doubleton and telling them what to lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  at top level players almost always lead the right card|pg||
nt|psyck: he is the one & only, but not the only profile he uses though :)|pg||
nt|rafizain: 6 dias makes [or 6  nt] possible swing hand|pg||
nt|kista: EW should end in 6N here|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|granguru:  so it is better to bid accurately|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
nt|dburn: Sementa might only raise to three, but he's more likely to bid four|pg||
nt|dburn: and he did, before I could finish typing that he would|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kista: pick a slam|pg||
nt|psyck: with no fit, 5N=pick|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I believe rafi and zain are the names of his sons. zia will correct me if I am wrong|pg||
mb|6D|nt|brolucius: East has found a strong lead.|pg||
nt|dburn: still, with this lead...|pg||
nt|danilo1: Well, now we have 4@S by West :)|pg||
nt|rafizain: but only a few imps on wether dias or no trumps ..slam easy enought o bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: now 7 tricks for Tokay|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3@C dont show about @Cs but only maxz and 3 card support|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i approve of breaking the transfer with only 3-card support, when you are so suitable|pg||
nt|granguru:  once hamman erred a gran slam lead...20 years the hand was appearing in the news|pg||
nt|peachy: running scores Round 3 (this round) http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda3.html|pg||
nt|sfranchino: i think east had cards for double 2@s he knows that pard had weak hand with @s and opps has not any save|pg||
mb|6N|nt|granguru:  And he used Judgement..with 2 aces he led the shortest one..(wrong)|pg||
nt|rafizain: yes those r my sons names|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: i think they play crystallic clear Polish club, book version (2005 edition)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be as JASSEMS polish is transfer inh his book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well. Helped a bit, but agree u|pg||
nt|runnerup: so vulnerable try -no trial just bid it -if not made -perhaps even anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: ...Duboin still can't make it, I don't think, but if North puts up the ace...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: Great decision by Lauria : 5@c would be at least 2 off when 4@h is down|pg||
nt|peachy: I did find a fairly recent card for EW http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: running a long suit usually creates problems for the defence|pg||
nt|peachy: NS basic system is Strong Club|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rafizain: well bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: he can't put the seven on this, because South might have @c98 doubleton, but he may still be OK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and they wont like the result from open room|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: Now a club ruff will beat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with best defence. a @c switch now|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @h9 ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  looks to ask for @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Failing that, a trump misguess by declarer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in that case possibilities to -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  E isn't willing to ask for a @c switch, not knowing what partner has in @c I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was declarer, after a transfer response to 1@C, at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if there is any possibility to defeat, it must be a @c ruff by E. Declarer can have @sKQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW missed the defense against 4@S - played by S: @H to K, @D to A Now @CK to A, @S to 8 and Q, @CJ to Q - but not @C again|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|pelu: now 9|pg||
nt|mamos: this looked very much a part-score board EW have some discards to find|pg||
nt|barnets: the def now have set up 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: a @d ruff for -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for declarer|pg||
nt|barnets: bu noth needs 2 entries|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes the @H unblock is the culpret|pg||
nt|hajru:  Looks like they got the order of the tricks wrong|pg||
pc|d5|nt|barnets: yes north had to play a spade|pg||
nt|barnets: when in with the @C|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: well played by W - he set up a trap - and N fall in|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and looking happily for the 10th|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@S is not good contract ... correct pass by Balicki ... |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ntmon: transfers don't fit much into the system, 1@D needs to be negative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and E must see that itÂ´s needed with @ha and knowing that N has @cK|pg||
nt|barnets: very tough play|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|danilo1: makin if he starts with @H first ... not impossible after @C lead |pg||
nt|dburn: he can play hearts now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: d6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|granguru:  looks that there is no way to win...no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  @DK ?|pg||
nt|peachy: There are 15 groups of 8 teams each, the top three (I think) will advance to the Swiss, from where top teams advance to KO etc|pg||
nt|peachy: This isnt quite making, I think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh for that 7th @C which why I never do it with 6|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|granguru:  what about small @d ?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ntmon: anyway, 4@H good contract, will make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: from each group|pg||
nt|barnets: a low heart also would have worked by north|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: So the chance is missed.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: board 16 was a bid 11 to close this match right up|pg||

nt|granguru:  garozzo had another saying..when you have a singleton, lead it...|pg||
nt|granguru:  obviously at suit contracts|pg||
nt|peachy: It is one of his famous "Rules"|pg||
nt|granguru:  in general, it made life easier for the defense...if you didnt lead a singleton..you didnt have it...|pg||
nt|peachy: Another one of Garozzo's: "Must have a very good reason for not leading trump"|pg||
nt|danilo1: he knows that pd must have very good @S + need @HK + more than just A in @D ... if all this, Adam would not bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|danilo1: but if he played @H before cashing second trump ... than meight do|pg||
nt|runnerup: 7 @s  here|pg||
nt|runnerup: bidding test|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Grand slam but will settle for 6 I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@c looks a possible contract with Ns competing in Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: many different actions possible on these competitive part-score hands where system makes so much difference|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should have been 2 passes by now wonder who's thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: are we ok op?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|jcomyn: ah a slam and a minor one at that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  openings are getting lighter and lighter, these days|pg||
nt|paulg:  his line did have a lot of play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ho hi in s|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S by south may work nt north|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how|pg||
nt|hajru:  club lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is 18-20 for meck here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|granguru:  well if @H behave he could have made it..but that would have mean @S were also 1-1 and the line should have been different|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but a good sacrifice too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 21?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: At Last tempo would have been better by @H ruffs. Hard to se for them|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@H? .. guess best bid|pg||
nt|dburn: key is South's diamond holding, but if South can get a diamond bid in before North bids Blackwood|pg||
nt|dburn: then North may be able to find what he needs to know|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not like Splinter with A .. as well as do not like 4@S with this distribution|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite an interesting one|pg||
nt|dburn: so 4@c-4@d-4NT-5@h-6@d (asking for third round control)|pg||
nt|danilo1: besides on 2@H may hear @D support and than key card (for @D!!!) |pg||
nt|dburn: despite that being a splinter with the stiff ace, it seems the best way for North to find out what he needs to find out|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see 4@C?|pg||
nt|dburn: he can't really bid 2@h - he would have the Devil's own job getting back to spades if South were to raise hearts|pg||
nt|danilo1: i would bid 2@H - cannot cost since I can allways corect @H contract to @S|pg||
nt|runnerup: dont see many choises|pg||
nt|bigtrain: so X foloowed by Q or jump in NT coming|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: top-players dont like the @d-suit :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@d must be relay for clarification, and 3@c shows no major probably|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will south bid 3NT with 3 small spades ?|pg||
nt|dburn: how is partner to know, after 1@d-1@s-2@h-3@h-3@s that you have four spades and two hearts, rather than five diamonds, four hearts and a spade cue bid?|pg||
nt|runnerup: and here it came|pg||
nt|danilo1: if pd has 3-card @D ... @DQ may bi vital card ... and therefore, I would like to hear @D fit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1@D opening would have exited East  i am sure but 6nt is likely to be bid here|pg||
nt|mamos: Do you double 1@d opening with the North hand Gary?|pg||
nt|rafizain: the only question is will mekwell take more or less bids to reach 6 nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2C prob Precision style, 5-6 clubs with possible 4-card major|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no not with 4@D|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: we had some coffe break|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rcerreto:  tough lead|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  nothing appeals, @d looks normal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I know about 3700 people who would bid 2nt with east hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  as I said at the beginning ..probably @S finesse instead of a @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is 2s not forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed you would - but you cannot cope with a simple raise in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Mahaffey won the first match 17-13 against a team from Romania (with Bocchi-Maddala!?), Aspe lost 10-20 to a strong team from England|pg||
nt|granguru:  panski plays 4@H here|pg||
nt|mamos: great idea :)|pg||
nt|kista: there is no game making for NS here|pg||
nt|rafizain: lev did well to make a non f bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  leading the longest suit is always an option|pg||
nt|ntmon: very hard to find @D fit because of intervetion and inevitable raise|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: wow needed coffee after the 3N I expect :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks for the update Micha;|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: good contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c more precise : no major and only one stopper ... South assumes the stopper is @s :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@H is I guess 3NT try ... Cezary knows how valid is @CQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: We have 4 diferent options by us 4 commentators. WHAT IS THE BEST BID AT E IN THE LONG TERM?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr.N|pg||
nt|suketbombi: lead will make it much quicker|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S may have backed in after that auction|pg||
nt|mamos: this should go down so little lost here by NS's passing|pg||
nt|psyck: they ended in 4 rounds here, while they are only halfway there in the 4th round of bidding other room|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg:  Bocchi-Madala are playing for Lavazza in another group, whatever the results page says|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: there is a little misunderstanding after explanation|pg||
nt|ntmon: protective X from W - can be really costly now|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi George|pg||
nt|danilo1: wha not ... than pd has 5-card @S ... so @DQ no more vital ... @HK instead ... again Key-card ... and final contract ... in @S|pg||
nt|runnerup: south took blacwood-so perhaps norht take 7|pg||
nt|danilo1: problem here is that they both need to chk what pd has in @D ... and they did not do it|pg||
nt|dburn: North can presumably show @dK and @sQ now|pg||
nt|runnerup: he should tell his card and all he still needs is Q @d |pg||
nt|dburn: but South can't count 13 tricks after that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s from N? in my opinion too strong and he must be happy that S could bid|pg||
nt|rafizain: 4 h can make if oppos dont cash ace of clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: To watch more than one table, http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   Then open a new browser window for each additional table|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rafizain: j spades it might be tempting to return a spade|pg||
nt|rafizain: j spades more deceptive...|pg||
nt|rafizain: still very hjards to cash the club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphplb: we have to wait for director decision in board 22|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sure, 2 more Texas on that 3N "save" against 2@S :) all square|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  David, would you lead small or an honour?|pg||
nt|chmitty: well bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|runnerup: that can be good for south to bid 7 i yhink|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: if 1Nt = 12-14 I know as mynu who would pass - 12-14 + 10 = 22-24 and no spec fit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to our second Murat, Anter|pg||
nt|jcomyn: p never gets in|pg||
nt|hajru:  managed to get the contract in the right hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant see how ew get any more than 3 aces|pg||
pc|c2|nt|MolvaM: the results page is here http://www.poznan2011.pl/results but since the event just started there is nothing in so far|pg||
nt|mamos: The match is all square 3NT-1 actually gained imps when EW made 2@s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all to play for both sides|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|granguru:  madala's father was the greatest VUGRAPH comentator of all times...a full show|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... bidding also looks like Lebensohn too - so one or another ... now in 4@H|pg||
nt|danilo1: now South knows ... almost enough :)|pg||
nt|barnets: poor choice of lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: A nice safety 1370, while 6@S=1430|pg||
nt|runnerup: and north happy -no guessing after all|pg||
pc|hT|nt|barnets: a trump would have been better|pg||
nt|hajru:  agree. |pg||
nt|bigtrain: trump lead would only hace slowed down the play...  the result would have been the same :)|pg||
nt|barnets: it would go trump @DK andsecond trump|pg||
pc|c4|nt|granguru:  bridge rama at the time|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  Ralf?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Polish Specs confirming Lebensohl|pg||
nt|suketbombi: actualy requirement is the @H finese after testing JTX of @C or JT doubleton so will be just about 55%:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: my feeling is Texans may gain 12 or loose 3 here|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi I am back - PC-crass (blue screen)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they are going to be in @DS  and grand combined is reasonable given the potential in @Cs and @S suit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H finese is the last resort|pg||
nt|buddyshah: They are playing 6@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the little bird told me that|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|dburn: I guess I would lead low - some danger of a blockage if partner has @dJx, for example|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am in the middle of writing a book that involves computer analysis of opening leads. We have found that leading the top honour is generally right.|pg||
nt|runnerup: claiming 2210|pg||
nt|rodal f: But 60 is a 2IMPer|pg||
nt|hajru:  This speeds up play|pg||
nt|kista: Meckwell have done 6 rounds of bidding and the auction is at 5@h|pg||
nt|psyck: they must be debating 6@d vs 6n i suppose|pg||
nt|rafizain: there shd be a bonbus for the least bids on a hand then we wd really have to play!!!|pg||
nt|daman: East should know partner has the @S Ace and the @C K|pg||
nt|rafizain: bonus..|pg||
nt|daman: with eitherof those crads Lev would be in game|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: well done Ish - 4@c must have been a pretty serious bid for him to use Blackwood immediately|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Sleeping:) LOL|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru:  .|pg||
nt|granguru:  In board 22 the 3@D bid inhibited Hurd to lead the suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  now claiming, for sure|pg||
nt|sfranchino: any way for make 7@d also with finesse @h that works @c 3-3 but any squeeze is possible|pg||
nt|suketbombi: so 3 imps it is|pg||
nt|barnets: with the @HJ falling second dec would prevail|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|brolucius: More often than the old text-books suggest.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a better play was to win the first trick with @c10 and hided @c9. could perhaps given an extra trick|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ntmon: one undertrick saved|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: an honour, if dummy has a middle @d|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  computer analysis could change several paradigms|pg||
nt|suketbombi: JTX of @Cs or JT doubleton @S QJ  if you dont trace a squeeze after failing that take the @H finese|pg||
nt|buddyshah: In pairs Qualification  :  Kiran -Satya  8th  and   Guptaji -Krv  35th  amongst 323 pairs. |pg||
nt|suketbombi: and the 3rd pair did not play buddy?|pg||
nt|buddyshah: I dont  see it.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonderwhat happened the 3rd ace in open room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: something thats going to happen here i think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: 3nt could be reached on this board in the open room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure they'll fix the team lineups on the results pages quickly, they have been very efficient|pg||
nt|granguru:  as for garozzo's saying ..it must have been under specific circumstsnces...such as a 7-level suit contract, or 2. a cross-ruff hand type|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|psyck: hoping for @dJ too|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chmitty: hummm ... did not see the @d Jack fall on the ace ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: interestig ... 3NT Dbled in OR, and here, 4@H not Dbled ... realy surprising (South is player with good Hearts)|pg||
nt|daman: routine cash now|pg||
nt|kista: Then we may find people leaping to slams Zia :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s9|pc|c6|pg||

nt|psyck: indeed, also the lowest scoring of all the QF's|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rcerreto:  oops, sorry|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anyone with me?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  with 2@d?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Closer to 3@S than 1@S, perhaps.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  1@s looks a little timid to me|pg||
nt|pelu: strange take out X by Baldurson|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good bridge here so far :)|pg||
nt|psyck: hopefully will be good to the end :)|pg||
nt|rafizain: 7 clubs is a great  contract..but bad break ..7 spades will lose a trump trick..oh who  told us that restricted choice works!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a 6-card suit @hK and a stiff @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade game needs to be bid.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  good sacrifice in 5@d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1@s probably shows 3 card spades?|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - prob support x in @H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or a dont-lead-a-diamond system|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they will now compete only up to 3 S venkat knws his points not working|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S|pg||
nt|pelu: I would bid 3@S over the X - not invit|pg||
nt|pelu: no Lebensohl by EW?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: I don't know that 1@H was right when East had indicated the majors.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe it was also meant to show real @c|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  unsure though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me a strong 3@s rise and an invite to 4@s|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and baldurson dbl is kind of a support dbl?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok he was down 2 - but recived a gift|pg||
nt|danilo1: interested in choice what/how to bid by South (1@C Polish, most often 12-14 BAL) |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Allerton may have misread 3@H but East can correct.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, this is the sort of board we were looking for, after so much drab stuff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he has a pretty good hand, in context|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you agree with the strong rise David?|pg||
nt|peachy: Strong 1C, probable 0-7 or some such 1D|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks a simpler task |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Lavazza leads Mahaffey by 1 this one is tied|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, no losing line with black suits breaking|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: other 2 have good leads|pg||
mb|4C|nt|granguru:  under this premise I agree fully..the same philosophy of the 6NT lead..dont give tricks away to declarer on the initial lead.|pg||
nt|granguru:  when you have points in all side suits normally declarer has a solid trump suit...|pg||
nt|ntmon: worked!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the best with this bidding is that W has shown his @h honour|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe their standard for free bids is higher than yours and mine|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C may be @D transfer, or kind of asking - if so 2@D may just show min.|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Richard Bley|pg||
nt|riccho:  Good Morning everyone :) |pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi Richard|pg||
nt|sfranchino: conservative bid pass over double now 4@s |pg||
mb|4D|nt|runnerup: 11 in @h and no ambitious higher so this is over in seconds|pg||
nt|barnets: well bid|pg||
nt|kista: Restricted choice is to be applied only when it works|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to get to 7@s with @sq missing, so only theoretical|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Easr didnt read the X from West as @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: saved by S|pg||
nt|murat: good afternoon all :)|pg||

nt|Walddk5: We will be showing the women and seniors at 17.00 local time, in about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be 1 imp to N/S for the lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: Although we may quibble with the odd bid or two, it seems that the players have judged it very well around the table. |pg||
nt|rcerreto:  anyway, they succeeded in bidding the par|pg||
nt|brolucius: The term 'free bid' was responsible for a lot of awful bidding many decades ago.|pg||
nt|murat: guess one of the most common names of Turkey :)|pg||
nt|sfranchino: why bid same cards 2 times?|pg||
nt|pelu: S just places himself between 2 chairs by passing over the X - 100% blame to S and ok bidding by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  in a difficult board|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, indeed|pg||

nt|riccho:  presumably...|pg||
nt|kista: Here Lev has not shown @c ..so they are out the trap in some way|pg||
nt|psyck: of course, never know when in 9 card fit if one of the pair decides to gamble|pg||
mb|5N|nt|rafizain: they might avoid 7 sp as no q trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|7S|mb|p|nt|pelu: as Peter in Denmark :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  done|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@c is asking about the @h suit IÃÂ´m told|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... we are guessing bids ... NS do not (they know :))|pg||
nt|sfranchino: pass is a bid that manypeople dont know|pg||
nt|barnets: it is a fine 4@H contract|pg||
nt|barnets: especially after opening bid by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  free-bid is something very different today|pg||
nt|riccho:  so they are playing the same answers after 1@s in rebid than after 1NT? looks sensible ...|pg||
nt|psyck: thought so, with 9 card fit, did not bother about the Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  -1|pg||

nt|peachy: I dont think there is reason to forget about restricted choice|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|daman: A @H  switched seemed routine    but the @C play will work out as well|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that 4@S failed at one table of the other semi. Do four round of clubs and a ruff with the king, leave declarer with some sort of guess?|pg||
nt|granguru:  @C would have best|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d then was probably a obligatory bid with BAL 12-14 Hands (a spec agrees here...:))|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfranchino: they dont know that is a bid like others means somethingh|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: must play a @H now|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  felt unhappy afterward, I presume|pg||
nt|pelu: as expectet (not Murat) also 1 NT in OR in Board 4|pg||
nt|pelu: west lost count|pg||
nt|granguru:  a 21-19 count|pg||
nt|granguru:  very poor fits all over|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW has 3 5-2 ones|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS only @D 4-4|pg||
nt|danilo1: if he guess rite in @H may even make 6 (do not believe) .. if Info is correct (4@H Dbled in OR). will not be good for Monaco|pg||
nt|daman: they cannot get in safely over a 3@D opening|pg||
nt|danilo1: no 7 by Bocchi -Madala in OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam 6@d|pg||
nt|pelu: N has limites his hand (2@S) and now just bid 3@S - for sure P by S his @cQJx also no value|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the cards have gone quietly flat|pg||
mb|1C|nt|MolvaM: that usually means our vugraf operator will soon close this table and reopen it to establish the link to the other table|pg||
nt|ntmon: not much on play yet, really|pg||
nt|mamos: NS have a lot of points  but won't want to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: what shld tokay do? dbl?|pg||
nt|chmitty: unless the ace of trumps fell on the floor :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Operator, 2C should have been down two, maybe|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: surprising, that - their auction seemed well on track until the final bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: agree peter he had won the board by bidding 2@S as his 1st rebid|pg||
nt|sfranchino: agree peter |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D made against the 300 here, so a big swing to Badger.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was wondering if South would overcall 1@s, easier to overcall 1NT perhaps|pg||
nt|granguru:  probasbly e could have avoided the mistake overtaking @D and playing @c9|pg||
nt|paulg:  west cannot make a penalty double these days|pg||
nt|rodal f: Whom to reach NY as low as possible?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N will do|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: again 1Nt with a 5 card @S - |pg||
nt|rodal f: *NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: and now ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 1NT 12-16 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, a couple of 4333 with not enough points for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North was in 3NT at the other table, doubled and ran to 4@D.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be hearts and a minor, so North asks|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1NTx was sort of +380 but Soith escapes|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok: 2@d showed a 11-13 hand with 3@h. sry for this mess, but its really difficult to guess the meaning of ART bids. And its boring to be silent... :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not much point reaching New York - they need to stay in Poznan for a few more days|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h from N now! |pg||
nt|psyck: & no fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: not the best lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3d could be makable but tokay wasnt sure about 5 cards @d|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS guessing can win 3@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1D! negative, 0-6(7) |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t like dbl from E. Ha has a 5-card @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry he....|pg||
nt|sfranchino: perhaps they use double in 4 position strong if not any sense pass from south|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: is Ventin from Argentina or spain?|pg||
nt|psyck: so max stop in 4N|pg||
pc|s9|nt|suketbombi: i may not be able to anser all individual chats pl no offence meant anyway multi tasking here|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: sorry |pg||
nt|barnets: good stop here|pg||
nt|rafizain: easy 11  [10] tricks..texans feekling hopeful  if parts get last hand right|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rcerreto:  do EW play transfer?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Transfers opposite 1@C are popular.|pg||
nt|granguru:  we will see a good fight here|pg||
nt|granguru:  as 2@S is a difficult contract to win|pg||
nt|ntmon: or not|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: With four aces missing, it seems that the three-level may be high enough.|pg||
nt|pelu: that the problem with 1@D opening - partner dont know if u have 2 or 5 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 4@s - but US never found the @s-fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  mmm|pg||
nt|granguru:  Does S have nothing clear  to lead?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prefer 2N rather than 2@H|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chmitty: and Lauria does not give up|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok this looks obvious here :) |pg||
nt|riccho:  15 vs. 8 HCP --> both players are a bit exaggerating their hands|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: Not knowing their system, North's Pass might have included better hands, and wek hands run immediately via Rdbl, that is one way of playing|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure how obvious is 3NT by East ... he is min, and 2 open suits ... OK, has 3 tens and 5-card @C ... still|pg||
nt|riccho:  now decl has 9 tricks in his bag. I c no other option than to play for @c to be 3-3 (or Hx somewhere). |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong lead .... and big diff. |pg||
nt|dburn: one more round of the Swiss, and both teams occupying places in the low teens with 27 qualifiers|pg||
nt|mamos: I hate 1@c and then 1@s on North  I like to be able to open or rebid NT on such balanced hands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S may get a bit excited|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, not much that NS can make here|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w may hve competed to 2@C|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: Obviously East had read West for a much better hand than he holds.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Still bidding 19 in the open room|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: and I canÂ´t see why...|pg||
nt|psyck: Not suire, looks normal to show the good @h's than @d stopper with Qxx|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|riccho:  E needs 33 in @c without alternative, because due to communication problems he has to duck @c immediately |pg||
nt|ntmon: looks like 1@D showing @h, 1@S nat forcing, 2@C weak preference, 2@H good hand|pg||
nt|daman: makes sense to me|pg||
nt|dburn: so both of them are well enough placed not to think about heading to New York (or Australia) just yet|pg||
nt|psyck: since you can always show @d stop at 3 level|pg||
nt|mamos: North wasn't going to be easily excited|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ntmon: i like transfer responses to 1@C - room for many gadgets|pg||
nt|daman: yes |pg||
nt|daman: I don't think 1@D was a transfer   I think just a negative over the big club|pg||
nt|daman: <7|pg||
nt|runnerup: club ruff -diamond ruff and club ruft with j@h gives chances to defence|pg||
nt|psyck: yes S sensibly did no try anymore when N only bid 3N on 3@c|pg||
nt|psyck: *did not|pg||
nt|barnets: as 2@H looks down 1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Such a shame to lose IMPs unnecessarily when there are so many other ways of losing IMPs.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  could W consider his hand balanced?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then open 1NT (or rebidding, if 1NT is weak)?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was presumably non-forcing, so it is hard to see how East had enough to look for an 11-trick game.|pg||
nt|granguru:  well he treated the  hand as a croos ruffing type|pg||
nt|granguru:  and protected potential @d tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Protected diamond tricks I think|pg||
nt|ntmon: then 2@C doesn't make much sense |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as 2@D any GF I prefer to have 4@H to bid them|pg||
nt|psyck: this must show 3 for them & they would raise with 4 immediately i suppose|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: If 1@s isÂ´nt spades, 1nt from W looks normal for me |pg||
nt|murat: 9 tricks i guess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another claim i daresay|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They have reached 2NT so far :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|danilo1: ideal def. is I guess -3 ... now  making .. @SAK and small @C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oqfrunda1.html for all running scores|pg||
pc|sK|nt|granguru:  now he is not so sure anymore....|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep ... may be here they are in some "hole" of their system|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what about 2D|pg||
nt|kista: similar start by texans in the other room on the last hand 1@s -2N|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: Although, 2D foes not necessarily promise 4+ diamonds|pg||
nt|daman: it does seem starange|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s seems to have shown hearts - some Italian pairs swap 1@h and 1@s around after this start to the bidding|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|peachy: In my opinion, the range 12-16 is susceptible to trouble at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: kib says my suggeswted method is common in Hungary, but we still dont know if NS play that way|pg||
nt|riccho:  with 23 HCP and no fit you have to be lucky to succeed in 3NT... |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong = unlucky (lead) |pg||
nt|daman: strange*|pg||
nt|psyck: that could indeed be decisive if they make some slam|pg||
nt|psyck: both want to do exclusion key card after that :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|granguru:  as we see, he changed his mind but fortunatelly N had a @S left|pg||
nt|peachy: if EW play 2/1 (which I do not know if they do)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no idea Michal the flag says spain|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|danilo1: waw :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  leading and slam bidding are the most expensive parts of team playing. This is another proof of that... |pg||
nt|danilo1: did he really believe that Cezary would play @C from Jxx?|pg||
nt|riccho:  declarer - much to his discomfort - found another way of handling the @c suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry gotg held up|pg||
nt|daman: Hi John|pg||
pc|d6|nt|buddyshah: same lead in OR  but  PS  play A and Small @S  saving a trick|pg||
nt|buddyshah: soon we will have a new leader, Board  19 going  texan  way.|pg||
nt|barnets: south likely would bid 2@D|pg||
nt|hajru:  Not sure who should bid what, I cannot blame W for passing 1@h with 5 trumps and perhaps only a 4-3 @c fit|pg||
nt|barnets: over 2@C|pg||
nt|barnets: it would be east to x 1@H and west bid 2@C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ntmon: hi John|pg||
nt|dburn: other pairs use double to promise hearts, and 1@h to show spades|pg||
nt|dburn: some antedliuvian folk persist in bidding the suits they have, but they're all in Swiss B by now|pg||
nt|danilo1: what would happe if North did not ruff, @DK, but discrad @S instead?|pg||
nt|psyck: they are a ton of natural & artificial raises available after 1m-1M|pg||
nt|mamos: "imaginative" @dK lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|MolvaM: I was asked twice the question "what are these people doing here" :)  probably looking at the strane flag combinations|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this is the European Opan Championship|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Open|pg||
nt|granguru:  excelent defense after all|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|danilo1: Adam will resolve problem ... if declar would have @HK, he will not be in hurry with @S unblock|pg||
nt|riccho:  decl may have trusted the length signal from S (it it was one...). DoesnÃÂ´t he know Balicki - Zmudzinski then? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: hiya |pg||
pc|dT|nt|suketbombi: this is a good board for texan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he plays usually for spain and lives in spain but is from argentina|pg||
nt|pelu: Ventin has played in Spain, but in Sao Paolo NPC for the Ateam from Argentina|pg||
nt|kista: Is n't1@s-2Nt-5@c EKCB ?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c7|nt|pelu: very nice defense|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|granguru:  declarer can lose 4 more tricks now|pg||
nt|granguru:  for down THREE|pg||
pc|hA|nt|granguru:  panski wished he would have been in dummy now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|chmitty: As usual, Lauria "manipulates" his cards for his best benefit and will claim 8 tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure - may gain a trick, but this looks one down at any rate|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is good as well|pg||
nt|buddyshah: now 10 @D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: match will be closer after this bd I guess|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: same bidding in open room|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|brolucius: Going two down may make it seem a bit less of a disappointment.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|granguru:  @Sq is a killer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed a double swing 5 to Texas|pg||
pc|c9|nt|riccho:  you dont only have to be lucky, but you should know when you are |pg||
pc|cT|nt|peachy: right, play trump and get those kiddies off the street, rest easy|pg||

nt|hajru:  and the first board without a score|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 14-16|pg||
mb|2D|nt|granguru:  S should have played a @H at trick 4 in tha last hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Nort upgraded this to Strong 16+ 1C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = 5+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: we can imagine NS will reach 4@s|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, ideal (double Dummy def.) was @H lead for !Q, @D back, and @H ... since @D block later ... -3 .. but NS foudnd way for  -4 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: he live in Spain (Barcelona) - but has WBF code from Argentina|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it went 1@c-(x)-p-(1@d)-all pass|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: I qm surprised at 1C|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  3@h is the probably the value bid for Mahaffey, but many just put 4@h on the table and make it the opponents' problem|pg||
nt|pelu: East for sure dont like his hand after 2@D overcall|pg||
nt|chmitty: Many will open 4@s in this position|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wrong again - oh well|pg||
nt|dburn: in theory, I guess North-South want to play this in 3NT as things are|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@H -1 on @D lead|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT GF Raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: you need take @d ruff here|pg||
nt|dburn: but it may not be so easy for West to lead a diamond - still, he has so little that he may see a ruff as the best chance to beat the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: or that @dJ will set up some tricks for his partner, at any rate|pg||
nt|suketbombi: key is wary of the 3rd seat opening |pg||
nt|pelu: also 1NTX in OR|pg||
nt|hajru:  transfer, 3N, 4@h, making with an overtrick?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I dont know how he can pass|pg||
nt|ntmon: should not be right :(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 11 tricks cold in s and he didnt even double 5c|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  South will pass, probably needs a fourth spade to double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5c at least 2 down to save some imps|pg||
nt|daman: it would be hard to stop below 3NT   I agree|pg||
nt|ntmon: hopefully 1@S is understood as forcing|pg||
nt|sfranchino: dbl again|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes can escape for 200 on a@S guess|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: Some might play a weak-strong 2NT on the East cards, to differentiate between strong and distributional 3@D hands.|pg||
nt|pelu: what a lead - but he will have a new chance later|pg||
nt|riccho:  heh|pg||
nt|sfranchino: 1nt double and 2@s pass |pg||
nt|sfranchino: any sense again|pg||
nt|sfranchino: this match is full of nonsense|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  no way to play trumps from N|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then it should make|pg||
nt|murat: anybody dbl with east hand ?|pg||
nt|peachy: Molenaar must have at least thought of balancing|pg||
nt|granguru:  leslie amoils is a canadian player...wonder why she has the USA flag here|pg||
nt|pelu: what would u bid? |pg||
nt|suketbombi: i think we all need to be careful B$ chossing the words |pg||
nt|sfranchino: if i double 1nt which is the reason for no double 2@s?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: B4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: eschewing the eight card fit ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  even misguessing @d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not me|pg||
nt|murat: i mean after 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|paulg:  standard Polish lead, second highest from three|pg||
nt|granguru:  @SQ9 big helpers|pg||
nt|chmitty: let's see if declarer finds the way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: a @c at trick 2 would reveal most of the layout|pg||
nt|chmitty: North can see that East does not hold AK or KDJ @c|pg||
nt|chmitty: and not QJ@h either|pg||
nt|psyck: sometimes we lose the bidding & play when operator adjusts result...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are now|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Plenty to think about before playing trick 1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i bet 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|barnets: West needs cash @DAK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rcerreto:  oops|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  they found the way|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Both losing semifinalists are awarded bronze medals. There is no playoff for third place (a good decision in my view)|pg||
nt|brolucius: East hoping for a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, 3rd-4th place finals are dull|pg||
nt|brolucius: But neither team has a bronze medal in their sights at this moment.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  winning A and playing a @h back would have forced S to play trumps but...|pg||
nt|danilo1: to lead for ruff is good when one has blank hand|pg||
nt|dburn: and if North-South keep bidding black suits, a diamond will look more and more clear|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rcerreto:  this way has a chance to discard a @h on @s|pg||
nt|pelu: why sh he X?|pg||
nt|pelu: and penalyse pd for a 3. hand opening? - u dont X in teams if u only exp down 1 - u pass and collect|pg||
nt|barnets: or he wont get them|pg||
nt|barnets: East should encourage|pg||
nt|barnets: to cash|pg||
nt|psyck: did well to push them higher|pg||
nt|rafizain: east west have dione well...this wioll go 1 down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rcerreto:  a very good chance now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda5.html  running now|pg||
nt|petergill: Cue bids are 1st/2nd, so N has denied @d control|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... @D lead is bid :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ntmon: more sporting contract but makes|pg||
nt|daman: I did not expect 4@S to be the final contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who would. another did you buy a lottery ticket hand|pg||
nt|dburn: too much science can be as bad as too little|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: double @S hook with eyes closed = easy game|pg||
nt|barnets: as he cant stand any shift|pg||
nt|Walddk5: In the other semifinal, Bessis is 22 up against Monaco A|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|MolvaM: looks like 4 losers but declarer will still look for an endplay to get rid of the@s loser|pg||
nt|murat: for a save or for some money|pg||
nt|jcomyn: missin just the KQ10876 of trumps|pg||
nt|daman: over 2@S   North could have bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ntmon: if N was afraid 1@H being passed out, should have bid 2@H|pg||
nt|daman: or    South could simply have bid 2@D over 1@S|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would bring 2@S if S has them for sure|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ntmon: i would feel elevated with S hand as such and did some cunning bidding, at least 4@D splinter |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|riccho:  another time to misguess sth for E here. Difficult to be right here after u mangled a hand like the one before. will be interesting to c if E is still inspired enought|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wrong defence. let W win the first trick and he will continue with trump|pg||
nt|psyck: to view multiple tables: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/client.php  click on "look around the site"|pg||
nt|psyck: Results: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/osfrunda1.html|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: score now 13-1 for Lavazza|pg||
nt|chmitty: is this the actual play ????|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer does not know that DA drops doubleton, he took a chance that E lead from QJxxx|pg||
nt|danilo1: another case for invitational bid ... and pass ... especiall when playing vs. excellent defenders ... |pg||
nt|riccho:  he should do it right anyway: S didnt open but showed @hAK now|pg||
nt|danilo1: this will go down much easier (unf. also less :))|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: trying to go down?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|danilo1: Diorgio shouldplay @D10 for ruff|pg||
nt|psyck: no, he wants to knock out @c 1st in case it was with E|pg||
nt|psyck: that would have been entry to E's @h if dec had played @s 1st|pg||
pc|hT|nt|granguru:  Leslie should be Les Amoils, male, lived in South Africa before coming to Canada|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hajru:  well, it looks as if he didn't|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: perhaps, but there isn't any pressing need for West to play a club - South did cue the suit, after all|pg||
nt|runnerup: sementa dont trust him :) -so good bridge -thoughtfull|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: @s4 sh ask for @c|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes u are right|pg||
nt|pelu: u can see all 52 cards, Stefano - the players cant|pg||
nt|sfranchino: one time the big player Dano De Falco said to me: when u double a partial contratc lead always with a trump|pg||
nt|rafizain: meckwell usually win the tournament they play in ...unless i am their tream mate!..|pg||
nt|Walddk5: :)|pg||
nt|kista: If W covers @s 10 this contract will make|pg||
nt|kista: very unlikely cover|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: fair enough|pg||
nt|psyck: e.g. if @dQ & @cA with E, then only 4 @s, 2@h, 2@d for dec...if @cA not killed immed|pg||
nt|psyck: This is a piece of cake for JM, on of India's top players|pg||
nt|psyck: *one|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|granguru:  probably with USA flag because Kamil's team is register as such|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: 2NT was just made on the deal where E/W went two down in 4@C, so 8 IMPs to Zimmermann.|pg||
nt|pelu: that a DD analyse|pg||
nt|danilo1: still ... -2 |pg||
nt|suketbombi: agree peter he was weary about the 3rd seat opening anyway he was like a person who was relieved that he does need to double again|pg||
nt|sfranchino: yes peter but i see also my opening pard|pg||
nt|sfranchino: if i double 1nt penalty how is possible pass over 2@s? i said only this|pg||
nt|suketbombi: so @S was guessed in OR in that 1nt X|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure, MY good friend Dano, would also pass here :):)|pg||
nt|hajru:  well, 2 overtricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|riccho:  Helgemo helness agreed with the bidding in bd 6 (but not in the play: +14 imps for monaco z)|pg||
nt|dburn: and besides, why should he play the ten and set up South's eight when, left to his own devices, South will play West for the ten anyway?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: if u X for 1 down odds are against u: 3 / 5 IMP|pg||
nt|murat: right|pg||
nt|pelu: vuln and 2 / 5 non vuln|pg||
nt|MolvaM: baldursson has too many high cards and has to defend carefully to avoid being thrown in|pg||
nt|murat: he should win with the king now|pg||
nt|chmitty: I think he is wrong : Versace would not easily raise to 2@h with xxx cards|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Very recent photo of Ish and Ash (i.e. NS) at http://www.abf.com.au/events/vcc/vccPhotos.asp?2011|pg||
nt|sfranchino: :) i know he is very conservative but i think that in this hand double from south is obbligatory perhaps he had afraid about light opening pard in 3 position|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Too many  lost opporutnities for Texans   in 7 boards,  so  stefano  is  somewhat  correct.    However other table in 2@H    so  3-5  more for texans |pg||
nt|sfranchino: anyway i risk same and i double :) if not i no double 1nt...|pg||
nt|barnets: another imp for n/s|pg||
nt|kista: lev must be thinking how to get out for down 1|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|ntmon: 2 off|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|murat: or else he'll be endplayed|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know why this team are called Texan Aces Krishna?|pg||
nt|psyck: he left one of the top most college in India early in the 70's to become India's 1st Bridge professional|pg||
mc|9|nt|sfranchino: A@d and @c|pg||
nt|rafizain: rodwell might make 2 spades in other room|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like the cover did happen :(|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: i made some mistake sorry|pg||
pg||

nt|rv: I will go along with Barnet that even as play went, it looked like Lev was 1 down|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: short break|pg||
nt|rv: we may need to wait for official scores at the end of the game to confirm|pg||
nt|rv: 6 deals to go, 2 IMPs difference, all 3 results possible|pg||
nt|rv: on last deal, even official score at web-site shows contract made|pg||
nt|jbgood: but entries have been corrected there before...|pg||
nt|rv: Please check http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/osf1t1-2.htm|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Not any more|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pfbr: hello Roland3 :)@H|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The operator clicked on a wrong card during the play and has confirmed that 3@H made|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bigtrain: 1NT is semi-forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Hi Anita :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: funny hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|rv: I can bet this auction won't be duplicated even if this board was played at 100 tables:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|suketbombi: north made a cunning pass hoping will cash 7 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: north was hoping for 7 winners|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|barnets: big disappointment|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and is now disappointed :)|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w landed in  great spot|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there last plus score|pg||
nt|suketbombi: great yes:)|pg||
nt|rv: surprised E-W in CR didn't compete to 3@d though|pg||
nt|barnets: now north wishes he had bid his clubs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|h5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rv: with 7-4 and after partner opens, it is a bit timid to sell out to 3@c|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w have 9 tricks in daimonds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|suketbombi: every one here is a seller there are no buyers tho|pg||
nt|rv: Sundarram possibly passed because he had 4 @cs, still it was big position to take sitting underneath bidder and no defense outside|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|c3|pc|h2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c5|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: maybe Texan Aces tiring here, this is where Meckwell score with their big match temparament and match sharpness due to more exposure |pg||
nt|Walddk3: I have a feeling that this match will go to extra time. If so, they are going to play 4 additional boards, then perhaps another 4 and so on, until a winner is found|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

nt|brolucius: All plus scores gratefully received.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  it was just a matter of overtricks then|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Can you stand another nail-biter, David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I have taken my pills.|pg||
nt|pelu: sorru on East|pg||
nt|granguru:  panski is trying to cash all defensive tricks bfore it is too late|pg||
nt|chmitty: a nice "challenge the champs" deal here|pg||
nt|chmitty: 7@h = 20/20|pg||
nt|runnerup: an other 6 for Apteker last board ns in 3 @c not doubled but down 3|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, you have tons of more options thanks to internet & BBO|pg||
nt|barnets: here a heart lead defeats 3N|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 2+ 10-15|pg||
nt|hajru:  don't they play a weak NT anymore?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hard to imagine another result|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 14-16|pg||
nt|bigtrain: haven't for nearly a decade|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT is 14-16 1/2/3NV   15-17 3V/4|pg||
nt|barnets: i have seen13 a lot|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they use special glasses|pg||
nt|barnets: :) special poin count|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: little break|pg||
nt|barnets: actually in 4@C in open|pg||
nt|hajru:  great, going to get a coffee then|pg||
nt|barnets: so that is optimum for n/s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but hard to resist nt|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll take this opportunity to guess the auction here then...|pg||
nt|bigtrain: P-1@D-1@H-3@H//P-3NT-all pass|pg||
nt|barnets: ilike that auction|pg||
nt|psyck: no prob, just confirm the final result|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Did this really make, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: ah ok|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: Kamil's team is listed as transnational, not USA, in the event|pg||
nt|suketbombi: frozen?|pg||
nt|sfranchino: uhmmm|pg||
nt|sfranchino: time to count points|pg||
nt|sfranchino: time please|pg||
nt|sfranchino: i must count|pg||
nt|barnets: in case north has QX|pg||
nt|barnets: in hearts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1D - 1H - 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk5: We must teach Zia how to watch multiple tables so that he won't have to jump from table to table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: CK has a link|pg||
nt|rafizain: yes please|pg||
nt|psyck: to view multiple tables: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/client.php  click on "look around the site"|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  S multi 2@D|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for Meckwell in the other room (probably not the last time we'll say that in this championship)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  I've noticed many pairs treat the Multi 2@d as weak with spades when it comes to their 2nd seat defence|pg||
nt|pelu: and 5@H close to make on a small @S-lead |pg||
nt|paulg:  it's rare to see that in the UK, but would work here|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@h from North?|pg||
nt|ntmon: krajewski in the meantime gains with a series of mid-sized profits|pg||
nt|daman: must be a canape opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: No credit for my hy-phen?|pg||
nt|pelu: for D = balanced 12-15 or any 16+|pg||
nt|pelu: for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  Amoil played for SA in the world teams in bermuda 2000 |pg||
nt|peachy: really light third-seater here|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: i thought that he is from Usa becouse he doesn't exist in EBL base|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@h looks best|pg||
nt|barnets: good auction walter|pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulg:  that is the norm in the UK too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|ntmon: strong @C variety, finally|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@d will be 'bid your major' (4@c would have been transfer to your major)|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes many play 2@D x= short in @S |pg||
nt|daman: this auction should show longer @Ss than @Ds|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: wd by West|pg||
nt|granguru:  and 2@d - 2@h 5+ @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is similar to the situation in the Open Room, where West doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: forcing pass in N?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And done we are|pg||
nt|pelu: when both minor J's drop there are 13 toptricks|pg||
nt|sfranchino: intersting 2@h...4|pg||
nt|rafizain: here n's might make 5 cl as there is a squeeze on east|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: Be careful because jtr is watching.|pg||
nt|granguru:  now a correct flag in W ...thanks Michal|pg||
nt|peachy: and another 16+ 1C here, maybe they have additional agreements on what constitutes a 1C opening that we do not know about |pg||
nt|ntmon: XX = transfer to @H ?|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 2 H = @H otr BAL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: strange 3@S|pg||
nt|psyck: W may have started planning to smolen, after hearing @h fit, sets that as trumps|pg||
nt|psyck: many play 3 of other major as setting trumps with possible slam interest|pg||
nt|mamos: Not so sure i like 1NT  - maybe Ok for experts but ..... |pg||
nt|hajru:  good guess walter|pg||
nt|peachy: To watch more than one table, http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   Then open a new browser window for each additional table|pg||
nt|psyck: can open any number of windows to watch multiple tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: ??? dbl from me as E|pg||
nt|paulg:  surely not a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmmm 24 hcp and want to defend 1s - verybrave|pg||
nt|barnets: if north had QX hearts only spot|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@H asks partner to bid 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: fom his side|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but East help him, in on @CK he played @D - ruff, @C to A @S to 10 and duck - and now endplayed - East sh play @C back and no endplay|pg||
nt|suketbombi: this one is a grand again  but needs both @DS & @CS to behave if only @Cs then Viena coup and........|pg||
nt|psyck: not ok for me either|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  a cheap save on 4@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S has escaped a double, but the cards lie well for declarer so the lack of a double will not cost E/W much.|pg||
nt|granguru:  In the meanwhile NS surpassed the safet level of 5@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  is 6@C makeable?|pg||
nt|granguru:  after A GAROZZO's lead|pg||
nt|peachy: on the surface, looks like just lose a spade, whether the tricks are there is another matter|pg||
nt|peachy: Kib who knows NS style says they love to surprise opps with frequent tactical bids|pg||
nt|riccho:  1 trick in every suit for ew = just make|pg||
nt|dburn: nervous for South - the kind of hand where if you overcall and get doubled, you know you are going down a lot against nothing|pg||
nt|kista: was 3@h 1 or 2 down ?|pg||
nt|kista: Rodwell in 2@s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|danilo1: despite 3NT looks makable for NS ... good defense should beat it ... so good stop|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/CGlossary/canape.html|pg||
nt|daman: website for results     http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d in time means now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not probably expecting a stiff Q@D|pg||
nt|psyck: & i bid many offshape NT's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't see the need for it|pg||
nt|bigtrain: where do i go to get my prize?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Bessis only up by 8 now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: but still a dbl....|pg||
nt|granguru:  2 discards on reds|pg||
nt|chmitty: as long as they do not surprise themselves that's fine :)|pg||
nt|psyck: agree, with good holdings in majors, 1@c is very normal|pg||
nt|psyck: Michal: please confirm if 3@h made last deal|pg||
nt|rafizain: lev wanted to be on lead against 3 nt ...unlucky!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Lost 14 on the grand slam hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: why not - u have bid game Red against green |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: its for me a good standard rule|pg||
nt|chmitty: Full brakes on, from North's standpoint|pg||
nt|chmitty: South has a lot ... can he give up ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 6 controls opposite strong club, he just cant pass|pg||
nt|hajru:  That is quite a useful convention, even though it doesn't help here|pg||
nt|barnets: roland will give you a coke|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: choice of plays - hate thast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably play on d and postpone finesses|pg||
nt|ntmon: on  17, meckwell started as reccomended: 1@S-2N-4@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps @H finesse, if ducked revert to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: little point in ducking|pg||
nt|ntmon: not an easy hand due to communication problems|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so many choices|pg||
nt|mamos: there a re shapes that are difficult to bid  but not this one for me :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: Had the cards lain differently, not doubling might have waved goodbye to 500 or so.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may have feared a third-hand opener, but her side was vulnerable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not know that partner holds 10 points, so he cannot double 4@S even with an extra value or so. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but shouldnÂ´t E?|pg||
nt|pelu: now N can make 1NT - topplay @Hs and only 6 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  3 discards on reds sorry|pg||
nt|granguru:  one @S given up|pg||
nt|pelu: most pairs use 2@S as the 2. relay - to get the Nt on the strong hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: many possiblities but by no stech a good grand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfranchino: what a bid horrible|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The contract is doubled at both tables in the other match|pg||
nt|granguru:  so just one ruff needed|pg||
nt|peachy: It is also possible that 4S was RKC|pg||
nt|sfranchino: horrible play also south and points are dummy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: vugraph schedule for future matches    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Quite right.|pg||
nt|chmitty: May be 4@s was kind of blackwood|pg||
nt|sfranchino: horrible|pg||
nt|suketbombi: you want to be in a grand stefano?|pg||
nt|pelu: the Swedish @C-system also got the Nt in SA|pg||
nt|sfranchino: dont understand the sense of 2@h from north|pg||
nt|sfranchino: bridge is easy 2@c 2@d 2NT if south has interest for majors he can bid 3@c|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 2@H = @H or  BALANCE hand|pg||
nt|sfranchino: and 2@c 2@d 2NT ?|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Very well defended  4NT    got  13 to Texanaces.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: it does make|pg||
nt|granguru:  not even garozzo beats 6@c here|pg||
nt|petergill: NS needs to get their @d trick before the @h are set up|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he can't pass - and even when del Monte can pass, he often doesn't|pg||
nt|sfranchino: so he can play from the right side|pg||
nt|buddyshah: i think  shows  @C suit in their system|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|peachy: WD White House team|pg||
nt|peachy: It would be nice if in a competition of this level, there were convention cards available|pg||
nt|chmitty: true :(|pg||
nt|chmitty: True also that there are many pairs in competition : huge job|pg||
nt|peachy: It makes kibitzing so much nicer, to know what the auction means|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chmitty: a suggestion could be that the players had to fill themselves an "electronic convention card" before the championship|pg||
nt|ntmon: right, John :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: its a headache hand |pg||
nt|ntmon: agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: d suit may die now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chmitty: that will come soon, I'm sure|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Stefano I suggest you look at their convention card they may not be playing same system as you do|pg||
nt|barnets: 5 imps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|murat: he should played the Ace @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: N with shut down with XX showing @H|pg||
nt|barnets: for e/w|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and just did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont think he found the best line entries are very short for finessing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant even get a s if d is returned|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  it is a good standard rule for me too, but not when one hand has pre-empted|pg||
nt|petergill: Good @S play - now S has to decide - @HQ or @DK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Now East may grab @CA.|pg||
nt|dburn: chances are that since East didn't double here South might get the clubs wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Michal, you know hoe to correct score on 21 if it did go 1 down?|pg||
nt|kista: strange that Sunderram sold out for 2@d|pg||

pc|hA|nt|pelu: for me "multi" is nor real preemt - just a semicontructiv opening bid|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  should she risk -420 to get 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|dburn: risk? what risk?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to risk a double in the first place.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: An excellent 6@D now|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer could have the singleton king of clubs only if she had about ten cards rather than thirteen|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  can declarer have one more @d one less @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on NS - a nice contract|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  N was declarer, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In theory, there is a club ruff, but fortunately for declarer, the defender with the singleton club also has @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting bidding test. If they bid it, I will applaud.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C is more tricky and that might be reached.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They may arrive in 6@C, though|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With problems on a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can they make 1C after a @c lead? I doubt|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the sort of board we were hoping for. No-one wants these matches to be decided on small margins after some drab boards.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @s lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c after a @s lead....|pg||
nt|peachy: In "real" championships, I think that is how it is done, these championships are open to anybody who wants enter from anywhere in the world, no qualification required|pg||
nt|danilo1: running scores now on: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|riccho:  a matter of style and system if u open the N hand with 1@c 2@c or 3@c|pg||
nt|riccho:  or even pass |pg||
nt|riccho:  3@c wouldnÃÂ´t be my choice anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i venture to say this was misplayed|pg||
nt|daman: good stuff for EW|pg||
nt|daman: N will open 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, N misread cards too, he must have had many chances including trying to endplay E when things were not going well|pg||
nt|barnets: only 9 now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6+@C 10-15|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: can it have a major?|pg||
nt|rafizain: cant see how 3 hearts made.but in life all is poss|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If one side wins after doing better on the big boards, then good luck to them - (even if they are not from England)|pg||
nt|murat: that was unexpected|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the contract went both ways during play and finally declarer came out as the winner|pg||
nt|paulg:  Seeing your partner pass when you have a balanced zero count is never good|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table on Bd 7: East bid 2@S after 1@H P 2@C, so W led @S to 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: par is 5@C X N/s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell require 6+@C for this bid in 1/2 seat|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pelu: 34 HCP - I exp slam with most tables|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s now from South?|pg||
nt|peachy: And teams can have members from any country = all transnational|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C precision style ... part of Polish @C system|pg||
nt|dburn: then, this match may be close to a tie after 7 and 8 are scored|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is either 1) weak raise|pg||
nt|barnets: south tries a psychic manouvre|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2) non-fitting 5-5+ GF|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not a tactical bid...  systemic|pg||
nt|barnets: oh ok |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C is artificial|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what do they open with 6c+4-card major|pg||
mb|2H|nt|riccho:  so a precision like 2@c opening here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays @d before havinc cleaned trumps, another @s will set up a trumph trick|pg||
nt|mamos: bidding challenge 3NT :@@)|pg||
nt|rafizain: 2hearts making looks normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: D'Ovidio has started well by emphasizing the diamonds before supporting clubs.|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS has a score sheet we all like to bring to the comparison table...all NS scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 6@C in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Waiting for the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk3: @SQ|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2NT forcing asking for clarifications|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what can ew make - d position pleasant|pg||
nt|suketbombi: please dont get upst with that 1@H bid it is a transer to @S|pg||
nt|psyck: W had several chances, but after the @d play & later covering @sT  must have let it make|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: but not so easy to bid the Grand|pg||
nt|granguru:  7@D should be|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@H may be too high|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: Ouch!|pg||
nt|murat: would you also prefer 2@s ?|pg||
nt|pelu: now @SA and 2x@c = down 1|pg||
nt|mamos: cant see where tenth trick can come from as cards lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: esp after that lead|pg||
nt|mamos: can South be squeezed?|pg||
nt|psyck: in black suits?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now our match has the largest margin of the 4|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe, if so @d lead would have killed the squeeze|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, that 4NT may prove the decisive deal|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they open 2@C regardless of the major holding as long as the clubs are the primary suit -- evem 6-7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Imagine winning the board with 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade lead would not beat 3NT if clubs were 3-2.|pg||
nt|brolucius: not beat 6@C, I mean|pg||
nt|dburn: a result with which both teams will be quite happy - it won't hurt either's chances for qualification|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: true!|pg||
nt|paulg:  tougher when you have not shown your 5-card support for partner|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is 500 no big deal|pg||
nt|rafizain: only way to make 3 is to play the backward heart finesse....lo to 9 and west ducks...|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: roller-coaster :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|MolvaM: this is interesting|pg||
nt|murat: Tokay should work some |pg||
nt|MolvaM: has to keep south out|pg||
nt|riccho:  to duck wont help here|pg||
nt|psyck: Zia loves to make full use of the 9's|pg||
nt|kista: Isn't that the Greek "forward finnesse"|pg||
nt|psyck: as he mentions in his book too if i remember right :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru:  Even if that doesnt mean anything, usually it is a good sign...|pg||
nt|chmitty: Lauria could hold : Kx KQ10xxx x Kxxx whixh would produce an excellent slam|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer does not know how hearts sit so he might duck one, but as it is, does not matter|pg||
nt|riccho:  or?|pg||
nt|riccho:  it helps: decl can develop 3 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|pelu: not DD but in practic play|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: bidding on bd 18 has taken off to 4nt already|pg||
nt|petergill: If NS can lock declarer out of dummy, 3@H will fail|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: would u X in West or bid 2Nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would have started with 2@d (inverted) personally, even if showing your 4-card major first seems to be growing in popularity|pg||
nt|daman: it isn't so much what they can make    can they reasonably bid over the 4@H opening?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda4.html|pg||
nt|rcerreto: la fai o non la fai la cue di x nel colore del compagno?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: sorry|pg||
nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Once all matches a completed, standings in each group will be here http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|chmitty: Lauria considering his options in case @h are 4-1|pg||
nt|peachy: there are 15 groups of 8 teams each|pg||
nt|chmitty: only danger to consider|pg||
nt|chmitty: ha can : a) play Ace @h and @h or b) play small @h to retain an extra entry in dummy or c) unblock @s ace and run Q @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no of course not unless someone doubles|pg||
nt|runnerup: go down |pg||
nt|dburn: they can do that all right - but a shift to @c9 might have been a trick more effective|pg||
nt|danilo1: @S back cannot cost|pg||
nt|runnerup: hand that is but club overruff comes anyway i think|pg||
nt|danilo1: lol :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: srry, private|pg||
nt|runnerup: south sees dummy -so i cant understand any but @s |pg||
nt|petergill: I think 27 teams qualify from Swiss A (i.e. this Section) and 5 from Swiss B, into the 28 board Knockout matches.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if @S and @S now ... Thk Giorgio will play on @HK doubleton|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pelu: but then u would mis a 4-4 fit in @H - pd could be 4-4-3-2|pg||
nt|danilo1: since @D bad ... declare cannot come to 9 trick on time .. before Nort enters with @SK 8if Cezary just continues @C)|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
pc|d4|nt|murat: dbl i guess|pg||
nt|pelu: for 100% 2NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I would bid 2nt|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT = 16-19, D + 2Nt = 20+|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: jassem may be lucky|pg||
nt|psyck: hmm|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: but he can finess @H10|pg||

nt|jcomyn: have to run folks but there are buckets of you there tx|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|runnerup: 9 better|pg||
nt|sfranchino: @d to ace and play small @h finesse to 10|pg||
nt|rafizain: in other room on the last hand ...north got 'sam levs' wish and is defending 1 nt...but they will make it easily!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|MolvaM: whenever I double, lefty bids 4@h and pd bids 4@s with 4 cards|pg||
nt|danilo1: now made ... time for 3@S tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chmitty: he has choosen option a) :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and we can see he is still Ok because South is endplayed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|murat: i prefer 2NT with 15-17 |pg||
nt|murat: bad 18|pg||
nt|riccho:  now he has 9 tricks in his bag |pg||
nt|danilo1: nice @C|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: Doubledummy = seeing all four hands, ducking is wrong. Not seeing all four hands, it is a normal play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meant to say 3 earler, Monaco look safe|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: many play that 1@D - 2@D = no 4 card major|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW could not X tor T/O w/o @S|pg||
nt|sfranchino: Q@h?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: So, 20+ IMPs swing due to a 4-1 break. Well, that's part of the game. Hard to take, though.|pg||
nt|murat: he was afraid of Q@c |pg||
nt|danilo1: @C continuation would beat|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: @cQ and @S back and Tokay will regret that he used his only entry to dummy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kibs are shocked... to play clubs from hand is purely double dummy. he cant do that|pg||
nt|pelu: but against storng defense his plan sh fail|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he can hope that @cA is with north but very hard to play for both honors to be there|pg||
nt|pelu: if S has showed distrbution in the black suits - and easy defense for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well some days even 2 club tricks could be enough|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could catch the @dQ|pg||
nt|murat: he's hopeless now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so to play for @cQx inside is not a terrible play|pg||

nt|suketbombi: yes they were born with 6 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract on OR|pg||

nt|MolvaM: did he really play the king?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the ace?|pg||

nt|sfranchino: a nice gadgest very simple is use 1@h 2@h 9-11 3 trumps support with one bid u can solve all u problems and use 1nt forcing 1 round|pg||
nt|sfranchino: now he has a problem|pg||
nt|sfranchino: solved from 1@h 2@h |pg||
nt|pelu: do Ns play 4 card @H-opening?|pg||
nt|sfranchino: i dont know this i think no|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a very normal way to bid on Ns hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  I played Mahaffey on vugraph in last year's Rosenblum ... luckily Meckwell were in Nickell's team on that occasion|pg||
nt|pelu: do u know Raju? - or some spects?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: All good pairs will know what to do after intervention over 4NT (in theory....)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Vriend team on their way to the final; 32-9 after a slam swing on board 23, like here|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand now, thanks to our operator Michal for a great job! Also thanks to EBL for getting these great matches shown on BBO.|pg||
nt|peachy: Also thanks to our opearor for a great job!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good 4@D by Ventin|pg||
nt|rafizain: pepsi is a solid bidder and wd not bid 2h with 3 spades as here   |pg||
pc|h6|nt|chmitty: it was a reasonnable 6@c slam here but that will be for another day :) SO enjoy your evening (day) and see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s found save in 5@C in previous board|pg||
pc|hK|nt|murat: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract in OR|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and will gain on 18 as well - odd|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no they play 2/1 as tutered by Eric Kokish|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the open event at this stage consists of short matches of 10 boards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so this is the last hand of the segment|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzers, you are the life of this party, appreciate all your comments and questions!|pg||
nt|dburn: not much in this, I guess - a club lead might beat 3NT, but I can't see why South would lead a club|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Wrang gets 1 on 21|pg||
nt|psyck: I just checked, 4@h could indeed make double dummy by running all the trumps on non @d lead :)|pg||
nt|rafizain: down 1  is good|pg||
nt|rafizain: 3 hearts 1 sp and 1 cl and 1 dia|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  I think 1NT as semi-forcing is quite popular, where North might pass 1NT?|pg||
nt|riccho:  some work here for decl to deny 6 defensive tricks here|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice lead by Martens|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcomyn: hate that bidding - cant find a 4-4 s fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: would be a nice lead against 4@S if reached|pg||
nt|ntmon: another odd gain on  20 - on missinng the right contract?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the world-wide disease - find some level of nt as soon as possible|pg||
nt|barnets: and east lead the @SA so it is likely only 2 down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk3: The official site has a score of 30-27 in this match. Not easy to know what to believe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cronier may fear a diamond ruff in 6@S, because he has offered the lower-scoring slam with excellent spade support.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to our commentators peter lund, and murat anter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and our operator michal |pg||
nt|bigtrain: never worry about saving at IMPs... it's a long term loser|pg||
nt|barnets: which is an 8 imp swing|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: and 1Nt semiforcing? - I hate that "semi" partner pass when I like him to bid, and bid when i like him to pass - So I never play that concvention :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: and our kibitzers|pg||
nt|kista: No the @d loser will vanish on the winning @h|pg||
pc|s7|nt|murat: my pleasure. thx everyone|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the next segment starts soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Round 3 scores  http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda3.html|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I have a feeling that this match will go to extra time. If so, they are going to play 4 additional boards, then perhaps another 4 and so on, until a winner is found|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk3: I trust our operators until proven wrong|pg||
nt|peachy: And to Pierre Schmidt and all commentators for volunteering their time and expertise.|pg||
nt|rafizain: but if n plays k dia duck|pg||
nt|rafizain: now the club goes away!|pg||
nt|kista: Roland preicts a tie here :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: meckwell play semi-forcing...  generally speaking meck passes all 5332s while eric bids on with 5332 maxs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|granguru:  1@D 1@H (2@S) 2N 4@D(RKCB) 4@H(3) 4@S(Q ask) 4N (noQ)5@C(cab) 5@H(2nd round) 7@D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ntmon: a replacement for "Wilkosz" convention which is banned by WBF|pg||
nt|ntmon: thx to all - let's move to OR for the rest|pg||
nt|danilo1: Y |pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board in this segment and an easy 4@s with 10 tricks. thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Lavazza - Mahaffey still only 1 imp|pg||
pc|cT|nt|suketbombi: yes up to bad 12|pg||
nt|sfranchino: lol|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: Finally, full vugraph schedule http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php so you can make plans to stay glued to your screen for more :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes you have a point venkatesh proabably had a 2@H bid but may have been more constructive i guess|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: must be tense there|pg||
nt|hajru:  D finesse and down a few|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: next match in 30 min|pg||
nt|kista: "predicts"|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: careful play by Bach - Duboin was going to put in the @d8, so it was as well that North didn't let him|pg||
nt|sfranchino: 1@h 2@h 9-11 3 trumps support 1@h 2NT 9-11 4 trumps support 1@h-3@h bad 1@h 2x forcing game 1@h 1NT forcing limited to 10-11 so u can report to @h in a weak hand with support|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer will be able to eliminate before playing Spades here|pg||
nt|psyck: There are still enough boards for anything to happen in any of the matches|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but the sands of time are running out|pg||
nt|psyck: twice 4, then 1 board sudden death if reqd|pg||
nt|rafizain: even a club wd not have helped ...bad initial analysis!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|riccho:  typical safety play situation here in @s to lose only one trump trick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|runnerup: tx all again -good match a lot off nice boards to discuss|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bigtrain: there are 3 things that can happen when you save...  and 2 of them are bad|pg||
pc|d6|nt|MolvaM: there are stars from each country|pg||
nt|MolvaM: including all europeans|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and the world champions from usa meckstroth rodwell too|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so just stay with us|pg||
nt|MolvaM: unofficial score is 37-1 lavazza|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but better check later with the website|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.poznan2011.pl/results|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for instance here, 2@C generally shows 4+ for meck and 3+ for roddy :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  interesting difference in styles|pg||
nt|paulg:  I thought these top pairs/teams were supposed to simulate these situations and get a consensus|pg||
nt|pelu: how do they explai that on CC?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|danilo1: tk -1 ... opening @H trick to def |pg||
nt|riccho:  but there are as usual other considerations to make as well|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bigtrain: its a matter of style|pg||
nt|danilo1: now cash 2@C |pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: so 4 more left|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  well, kokish at least|pg||
nt|bigtrain: note i said generally speaking|pg||
nt|pelu: but their opp sh have that information|pg||
nt|danilo1: Thanks all|pg||
nt|psyck: if tie in finals 8+8, instead of 4+4|pg||
nt|rafizain: how many boards?|pg||
nt|rafizain: meckwell are the best pair in the world in close matches|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|peachy: bye now, come back for more in less than 30 minutes, Round 4|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table on Bd 9: Bocchi is in 2@S by North, which might or might not make|pg||
nt|mamos: well done |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good line|pg||
nt|psyck: 28th last here|pg||
nt|kista: Zia @d10 shift may have worked|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|c4|nt|pelu: general style = agreement = on CC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they treat the 1NT as semi-forcing and announce it that way...  what they do as individuals is just my observation|pg||
nt|barnets: the opps might bid 1 more and go down |pg||
nt|barnets: that is one|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|riccho:  defenders are stripping there hands here. An endplay may be possible now|pg||
nt|rafizain: 10  dia brilliant but hard |pg||
mc|8|nt|ntmon: last board of the set, next round at 13:30 CET - roughly within 40 minutes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx all - interestin set but not great bridge - I think|pg||

nt|suketbombi: so the needy got their 2 imps after all|pg||
nt|rv: rare defensive error by Meckwell|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs comment the size of clubs returned by Meck |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bigtrain: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: one kib even asked weather they play reverse suit prefernce:):)|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|athene: they do play upside down suit pref but leading a big card in a suit to deny strength in that suit isn't a SP thing is it?|pg||
nt|rv: yes they do play rev SP, Walter can enlighten us more|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Ok:) they do they do |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: spot cards leads during the hand are 4th or attitude depending on what is needed|pg||

nt|rv: good decision to balance by Venkatesh here|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|Walddk3: The English pair bid the higher scoring slam on 24, 6@S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the @H T will end his agony  so 7  tricks to the happy man|pg||
nt|mamos: the play in the Open Teams has been exceptionally high standard  -  with some truly great players|pg||
nt|barnets: you might give away less a score that is 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|pelu: 2NT sh be GF - and then use Bergen with 6-8 (3@D), and 9-11 (3@c)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i can count on one hand the number of times thats happened to me in 30 years|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: splinter|pg||
nt|mamos: This is tricky  what's'the best contract NS?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is there one :)|pg||
nt|psyck: hmm, 2@h or 3@c for mere mortals, quite something to splinter for a minor which may not even be a suit|pg||
nt|hajru:  I don't understand what declarer did open on board 9|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: 2NT 10+ give problems if opp bid on high level|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now you know why texan is billionaire even high cards are attracted toward him:)|pg||
nt|kista: Zia would you respond with the W hand ?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|psyck: Finals tomorrow will be over 3 segments, unlike the 2 sessions we have been having in the knockouts so far|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 2 IMPs back|pg||
nt|brolucius: Premature for South to bid 3NT. Quite rightly, she asks for more information with 3@C.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Could be 30-29|pg||
nt|pelu: but Bertheau in OR are not even millionaire :) same high cards :)|pg||
nt|sfranchino: 3@h 3@s was not cue bid?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ask for the @H honor will bid 7@H in a flash|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfranchino: he has also 10@h he can bid 8@h|pg||
nt|psyck: well sry, after 1@d opening, 2@c surely will be a suit i suppose|pg||
nt|mamos: 5@c is a fair contract which looks like failing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and 5@C looks a make|pg||
nt|kista: Who is getting pushed here ?|pg||
nt|rafizain: i 3 h too much on p who passed 1 cl|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: and 3 x 16|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: or not|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry Gary is correct  |pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c should make indeed|pg||
nt|mamos: except?   on Diamond lead|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, 2@d & a @c :(|pg||
nt|rafizain: but down 1 ok against -110 or -140|pg||
pc|cA|nt|suketbombi: lol no just wants to know the @HK|pg||
nt|pelu: no only 7 with 2 H, can show A or K|pg||
nt|barnets: on 4 rounds of diamonds dec pitched his heart loser after the @SA lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: North has a hopeless hand for Blackwood and suggests a slam by cue-bidding his club control. A good bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: We will be showing all 3 finals starting at 10.30 local time, 9:30 am UK, 4:30 am New York, 1:30 am Los Angeles, 6:30 pm Sydney|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|sfranchino: against grand slam lead with trump i think is not never an error|pg||
nt|barnets: i think he should have ruffed high then gone just down 2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: With her club honors wasted, South signed off.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but looks like S downgraded her hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was never going to stop out of six once partner had bid 2@D and then agreed hearts.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead is probably a killing lead|pg||
nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow and 6 I don't fancy at all|pg||
nt|psyck: well, this will produce a more sure result :)|pg||
nt|mamos: Might E have doubled this ?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @d 3--3 and @dK on side....|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 more to Wrang on 22|pg||
nt|psyck: N certainly overbid, he had described his hand & S chose to play in 5@c|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|brolucius: A French kibitzer tells me that 5@C is exclusion Blackwood (club ace excluded). 5@H shows one such key-card.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Another one says it is not. So, I will say no more on the matter.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 1@S = minors I presume|pg||

nt|hajru:  Yes, though I don't know what the 2@s bid showed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: The diamond finesse was likely to work after the 2@C overcall on a Q-J high suit, so it would not be fair to describe it as a 'slam on a finesse'.|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: I got so bored of losing by 1imp/vp that last time i named my team 1 IMP & won the tourney|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kiwibridge: predict flat 3N here anyway|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks playable|pg||
mb|p|nt|rafizain: i predict 3 hears by west ..after n's bid to 2 spades!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psyck: and biddable|pg||
mb|d|nt|bigtrain: 2@C = artificial GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@H a transfer, so 2@H natural. Even when 1@H is natural, many pairs use 2@H as a natural bid over it.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: You have plenty of other calls when you hold the unbid suits.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rafizain: i KNEW lev wd dble..he has taken my money for years with tough bids like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: we have the low scoring match here : Bessis - NL White : 39- 8! and Monaco - Rosenthal 33-8, Mahaffey - Lavaza 22-19|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@s = @H rebid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: Monaco A confirmed 1st semi finalist by 15|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@sX on 25, so 'only' 7 imps instead of the 11 we were dreading|pg||
nt|hajru:  That looks quite agressive considering their opening bids|pg||
nt|kista: W took the push|pg||
nt|rafizain: as usual it is correct to push from 2- 3 leve....down 1 is always good bridge|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|Walddk3: Board 25 scored now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Leslie appreciated that her partner might have been forced to bid 2@S on a doubleton. Indeed, he may have had methods to show 3 spades over 2@H. |pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks normal to me|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 64 with great spots|pg||
nt|bigtrain: how can he not GF|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: can defeat with @h10 backm @S to A and @h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: brb|pg||

nt|Walddk3: So Texans need to bid this game ... and make it, to tie|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Venkatesh-Keyzad do bid aggresively, amongst the 3 pairs of Texans, I fancy this pair most to bid this game|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Wel, to win actually|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They are vulnerable|pg||
nt|jbgood: so needy have to bid and make game here - or take some doubled downers|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N by north only chance|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT is better than 4@H|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rv: now they may bid game|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N makes except for club lead and spade switch|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: This is a maximum|pg||
nt|rv: Venkatesh will accept with 5th @h and controls|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 3 aces and a king, and a strong 5-card suit|pg||

nt|rv: making now on right @d guess?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: can't make. There isn't enough time to do everything since Rodwell has J9x@H|pg||
nt|barnets: he can make by drawing trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: and leading a diamond to the 9|pg||
nt|ritong: 3 rounds of trumps, @d to the 10  you beat this, adam?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: How does he get to dummy before they have set up 4 tricks then?|pg||
nt|rv: yes play suggested by Henri|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: if Jeff ducks, it cannot be made.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: There is no legitimate way to make|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - may still be defeated|pg||
nt|rv: no quick entry in dummy to enjoy last @d winner |pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes cannot unless Meck jumps with @D A unlikely:(|pg||
nt|rv: yes right analyses as pointed by many specs and GIB|pg||

nt|rafizain: normally!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: India in 4@H - a fair contract, but no chance with @hs 5-0|pg||
nt|mamos: absolutely the match very much in the balance|pg||
nt|rafizain: now he must pass|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: bidding worked, though pass did look normal|pg||
pc|dT|nt|suketbombi: needs both aces right  lucky that the only ace with West is the @HA|pg||
nt|mamos: Ty Michal|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was 7, and a possible game on the next, enthralling stuff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: No doubt it is only worth 2NT, in truth, with no honours in the four-card suit. |pg||
nt|psyck: Couldn't ask for more from the last few deals indeed, all fans of both teams keeping their fingers crossed :)|pg||
nt|mamos: one off if they cash   |pg||
pc|h5|nt|barnets: so north bid 5@C as a save and they bid one more walter|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kista: 10 tricks after this lead|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|nt|brolucius: I was perhaps forgetting that they play 14-16 NT. |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: West did not open on the 10-count at the other table, and N/S then shut them out for two down NV in 2@H. But more IMPs away, since 3NT failed.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, the match has drifted away from the gallant Badger team. Well, I think they have played excellently and I salute their triumph in reaching the semi-finals. Well done, indeed!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thts true...  of course the number against me still stands at <5 :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: The stuffing was knocked out of them in this second half by the events on the two 'slam hands'. Of course, it might have gone differently but that's bridge.  |pg||
