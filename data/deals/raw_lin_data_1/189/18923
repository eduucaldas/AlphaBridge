mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  welcome back in Poznan|pg||
nt|davpro: Morning all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes   h   missing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult grand to bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems bochi plays in both rooms :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  A splinter in North would do fine - in later defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|davpro: Thx operator. It looked like an forcing pass-opening :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|davpro: Who is Brogeland playing with?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty operator|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|davpro: Ah- there the name came|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You have seen too manu bad overcalls, when you sell out with the North hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: missing the @DQ they have to diagnose they have extra trump length to compensate|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|Gerben42:  south hand is known as Bridge World Death Hand (BWDH)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  invitational values with 3-card support for partner|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a nice hand with spade values and N has an easy raise to game with 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has built a trap - will remove to 5 @H, only losing 100 I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is there a reward for "slowest bid hand of the tournament" - without special reason...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello all|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with Qxxxx x Axxx xxx North would pass and 4@S would be cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt played the other way round - no spade lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|Gerben42:  but there is normally no perfect answer|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: 10 tricks are on ice here|pg||
nt|roswolf: players names will be up in a mo|pg||
nt|jbgood: going through the motions|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 controls and west will ask for the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks dangerous -all tricks possible|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed 4@s and E might have shown 4@h. I don't know their system :(|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: didnt bother played his pard for 3+ diamonds or the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D may yhave promised 3+diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|nt|MolvaM: who can hold Qxx diamonds? thats the question|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: only problem is the potential 3-0 trump break|pg||
nt|roswolf: doesnt matter here:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does the lead tell any story|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|jbgood: puppet i think - then 3@d shows 1 or 2 4 card majors, and deny 5|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  13 tricks - over|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  or 12|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bagman: One of the answers is to use an artificial tool to separate hands with 3 card spades and those with 0-2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 6 is down with @H lead|pg||
nt|davpro: y- that was my guess too|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: then responder bids the suit he doesnt have |pg||

nt|roswolf: 10 or 11 tricks operator?|pg||
nt|davpro: there was actually 12 to take (double dummie)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: solid start for the dutch|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good start|pg||
nt|roswolf: a fortuitous start for angelini|pg||
nt|roswolf: hu bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi bill:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: more spice here|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: 10 point all around. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Peter and Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello|pg||
nt|athene: without the @DA Nunes would likely have led fourth best|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: with 6/5 and only 1 defencive trick normally better to play in attack|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|runnerup: perhaps east should take it away -he has got support in hearts so ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: Angelini seems to be in the A Swiss almost no matter what happens in this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand for n/s to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: y and Mossop will need a good result to joij them|pg||
nt|roswolf: fulvio has seen his pard's bids before|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|davpro: *join|pg||
nt|jbgood: 24 vps to Mossop |pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 from each group to A - the others to B|pg||
nt|pelu: hard decision by S - 4@H is down 1 and 5@c also down 1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c looks good|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 5@c making - only defense is @H lead and the @S - kill the entry for the 4. @D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  About 12 tricks again - but lucky and only in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jxxx in @D are very much - the double by Versace means balanced hand value in @S - Zaleski can reopen|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|MolvaM: kibs rush in to tell me that if defence plays spades 5c cant make|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 27 from A and 5 from B go on to the KO stage|pg||
nt|davpro: They found a 6-1 fit instead of the 6-0 fit. On level higher though|pg||
nt|pelu: has to take 3x@C befor @D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eamongall: the non-vul Townsend might venture an insurance 4@Hs |pg||
nt|jbgood: but I think a black suit or even NT play better than @ds|pg||
nt|davpro: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: some sort of short suit trial bid?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|MolvaM: we see all 4 hands but sometimes at the table it is not obvious to shift to spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: so 2@C forcing one round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best lead: @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - NORTH is declarer... - wake up|pg||
nt|pelu: yes defense has to kill @SA|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: south wont get in much to lead trumps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would also make on the @S-lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead small @S possible but @H equivalent - many use to overcall 1@S in West to give the lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with weak 5332 i agree to pass like Versace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But an overcall would put the contract in South, so...|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing really helps,but contracts should have been by south this time -by n= -if spade lead,but now 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the option between @H and @S lead is a typical problem in bridge|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eamongall: Now defence need to get active |pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4s has good chances|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
pc|hK|nt|MolvaM: with trump Kx inside and clubs 3-3 and the @dK safe|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: and wont necessarily lead one anyway:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - wrong table:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe 2 |pg||
pc|c4|nt|eamongall: still time |pg||
nt|bagman: N has to duck the @HK if W plays a low heart|pg||
nt|bagman: Both N and S know that there are no spade tricks to make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even in the case of a spade shift, stuurman has to be very careful to keep all his diamonds and let his spade honor go|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: i prefere to lead in the suit more solid, but without a solid suit i prefere the lead from small cards - but is is only a opinion|pg||
nt|jbgood: NT is more flexible than 3@d|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bagman: They also see the clubs so they can make extra tricks only from trumps|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|athene: a stronger defence was diamond lead, heart back, then another diamond|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks like a peaceful 3 NT by N|pg||
nt|jbgood: or S for that matter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tokay-baldursson at the open room is a very new partnership which might explain why they couldnt find the grand|pg||
nt|athene: certainly a bit of a gamble but it paid off very nicely this time|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|runnerup: normal 4 @h = with no other ideas -from anyone -looks like it ,but..|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|bagman: Rimsted clearly gambling with her heart suit|pg||
nt|davpro: yes. 9 easy tricks, but not the best communications...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 nt - 2 @h - 2 NT - 3 NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  some would call it practical :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all colors taked by weak players :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North bid both, @D and @H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|MolvaM: misfit hand but contract seems makable|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible here perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 6@S would not be great here even with the @D9|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|athene: the point being, on a club lead, you have to draw trumps and then cash four hearts to discard a club from the north hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|MolvaM: the first non-alert after 3 rounds of bidding :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: N should know that the @c king counts for full - and bid 3 imo|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|davpro: They stopped low, but if @ds are not 3-3 a higher contract would be a struggle|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: although the bidding thus far is cloaked in mystery they seem to be powering into it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42:  with a bit more fortune it would have been a claimer|pg||
nt|bagman: In pairs it might not be that practical as the bonus for the game is not that big as in teams|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duck this @D could be a idea|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gives the same result, if South plays safe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but give at south the chance to fault|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: 4@S MIGHT BE FINIS|pg||
nt|roswolf: and it is not sure what happened there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at the other table, tokay asked for keycards and then asked for the trump queen apparently. why??|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  Absolutely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on the previous board|pg||
nt|athene: actually i guess it would be ok (provided the hearts come in)|pg||

nt|MolvaM: another lively hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@h is max|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|bridge_one: same defence in other room |pg||
nt|athene: their 2-level openers are 10-13 and only really, really huge 9-counts qualify|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed not now here come the fireworks|pg||
nt|athene: in third seat, of course, things are relaxed a bit... :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: north will lebensohl his way to 3@H i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: can west rdbl for blood here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H is limited at 9 hcp 3 cards raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3rd slam hand in a row?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|runnerup: you have to guess well to make 4 @h -but that is bedt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A poor 4 @H - but you might be forced to "guess" right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East is evaluating what bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: this @d lead asked may help to get rid off spade looser|pg||
nt|jbgood: choice between dbl and 1 NT...|pg||
nt|jbgood: pass never an option for Boye on a near opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: lebensohl is heading n/s into danger here|pg||
nt|athene: well, whether he can or not, he didn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will leap high|pg||
nt|MolvaM: leader board and running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: but is it high enough|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you redouble in these auctions you help opps because they now have more room to scramble for the best fit|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|jbgood: but defense may start with 3 spades and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where south needs discipline|pg||
mb|d!|nt|jbgood: not any more|pg||
nt|davpro: 8 quick tricks for defense here on a spade lead. 7 for declarer on that lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 7 th in the bag|pg||
nt|athene: also you warn them with borderline hands to stay low|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S WHATEVER IT MEANS SEEM OVER THE TOP - WEST SHAPENS HIS AXE|pg||
nt|athene: so here for example if west had redoubled, south might well have decided his partner didn't have what was needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: sharpens|pg||
mb|3N|nt|MolvaM: lets see if they can locate the missing @d control|pg||
nt|roswolf: they should do|pg||
nt|roswolf: the flexible double|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch is comming|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer needs to ruff the heart losers and discard a club on a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  UNDO|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade honors not so attractive for madala|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well be passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has nothing to cue and has soft club values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: they dont have a lot of hcp to spare|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR NS in 6@H - looks like S gave a false cue bid in @D - but it was an artifical bidding over 6 round|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow thats enterprising|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the italians are merciful|pg||
pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: in another table north could go with J2N and that might be a problem|pg||

nt|MolvaM: does 4s have any specific meaning?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just an old fashioned cue?|pg||

nt|hawe45:  But how can you play bridge - NOT leading partners suit with Ace-x???|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You MUST have seen too many bad overcalls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: try both finesses and hope that the @d10 takes care of itself|pg||
nt|roswolf: the pass of 4@S said dont lead one i am told:) so he follows his own suggestion:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: very controles bidding here|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange that N didnt try a big spade first...|pg||

nt|bagman: NS can make a minor suit slam|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe EW have some Namyats type of device over 1m openings|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3N-2 was only worth 20%|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  last round not finished yet?|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can show real clubs, S hand becomes very valuable with the source of tricks, heart control and trump support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if it starts 1@C 4@H, what does S bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4NT perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: but E has a hand where she can prevent NS from changing that information. After 1@C, E can bid 4@H and then?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. tough if 1@C can be short (3 or even 2 cards)|pg||
nt|bagman: if 4NT shows primary diamonds and secondary clubs then it's the bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the problem with such a bid is - what will pd think it is|pg||
nt|bagman: I wouldn't be surprised if there are some other agreements for the meaning of 4NT|pg||
nt|bagman: or no agreements :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is an area where regular partnerships are ahead of the game|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@HX is 500; it's better than the vulnerable game for EW so they might take the sac|pg||
nt|runnerup: 11 in both tables and we though how to make 10|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me slam makable if no @d lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well if you can duck a diamond and then squeeze somebody afterwards :) maybe|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: for running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: south could make 6 of a red suit here if only he could get to dummy twice (lead the @H7 picks the suit up)|pg||
nt|roswolf: there will be some fun and games here|pg||
nt|athene: sorry - of course he can do it|pg||
nt|athene: lead to @SA, and lead the small heart|pg||
nt|athene: then later get to dummy with a heart and lead a diamond to the queen|pg||
nt|athene: easy!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm perhaps not at the table -in the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: only needs east to have @HHx and @DKx|pg||
nt|roswolf: game not reached at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: hampson-greco playing precision so 1@D is nebulous|pg||
nt|athene: south can be very aggressive if he knows his partner actually has some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but not when it might just be two small|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed these kind of hands are horrible for strong club systems|pg||
nt|roswolf: or less bill|pg||
nt|athene: well it's at least a doubleton for them i think; they use 2@D for the short diamond hands|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: Nunes call director|pg||
nt|roswolf: short of bds!?or something wrong with the last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: becouse 2nt invit or forsing |pg||
nt|athene: hmmm - they are not happy about something from the previous board, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: ah - you mean nunes was told that 2NT was showing a good hand and that is why he didn't double?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Gerben42:  something to be said for 5@H overcall too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in 4@H in other match one made one down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  5 @D N/S should end the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: wont make much difference anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: if trumps were 3-1 he would have to fall back on the @d hook|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bagman: against a strong 1@C 5@H would be fine|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt also,but ew can bid more|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S here is the likely spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart partial would be sensible|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: 5@D can be beated with @S lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: no just loose that|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: small from table |pg||
nt|jbgood: some lucky day you make 6 @s on this lot - but not today|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt now? :) - he does have seven stoppers in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: the diamond suit now consigned to the dustbin|pg||
nt|athene: i bet a lot of partnerships don't know what a jump in 4th suit means|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. 3@D here - is that natural forcing, natural non-forcing, or what?|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is wrong with a natural 1@D RESPONSE?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: south is sensible|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west also :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would have been interesting to watch 3@dX|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever bids a strong 7-card minor if they have a major of any description|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: after pass at 5@C @S lead became possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lightner...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S ruff, K @C - declarer lose the ruff, one @C and A@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup he had the colors to help him|pg||
nt|athene: i think officially in SAYC a jump in 4th suit is defined as natural and invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: ok wrong hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No right hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many pair use pass at 5@C like OK to lead @C, instead DBL means to lead in another suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i don't know the gadget played by E/W|pg||
nt|jbgood: investigating for a club contract (slam?) and got no reaction of a positive kind |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: so it was all academical|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Malinowski has very little defense and can hope that they go down only 3|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of those dark corners that no-one knows about|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1-5-7-0 will not be an obvious shape to the defenders|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: @SK to the ace, diamond finesse i guess|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: now np|pg||
nt|MolvaM: trump lead effective stop a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni might stick the @DK in|pg||
nt|roswolf: but north made a normal if aggressive raise to the vul game|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: kibs - if u know EW-bidding then help us :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bagman: Good time to take the save; in pairs taking an 800 save against a making slam is not a way to win; normally you should take your chances and try to beat the slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: @d cue was what S did NOT want to get|pg||
pc|d4|nt|davpro: But from Ns view; doesn't it seem as if S hasn't got a @h cue?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|jbgood: N looks to take no notice...|pg||
nt|jbgood: S bid well - N somewhat undiciplined - slam is more like a Roland one (which in the old days would be called a Norwegian slam)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|davpro: This could take a while, but will end with 1 down...|pg||
nt|jbgood: If N has the @c Q in stead of the @d Q his hand would be better though|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bagman: (unless the slam is such that everybody bids and makes it)|pg||

nt|szalay:  N-S are a rare pair from Hungary: they r not from Budapest|pg||
nt|szalay:  from our Sun City, Szeged, and could improve a lot thx to BBO|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: for sure W cant bid 5@s - but I have been wrong before :)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bagman: Having showed 44 majors and getting no reaction from partner, W could show his 3 card support expecting to be in a decent trump suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: If anybody is following a pair you can find their probable table from the following |pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye may lead a club now and get a plus score ag 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it was the @C position which influenced him more|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much to the play the club ace is right or it isnt:)|pg||
nt|athene: if west invites, east might bid it on the strength of the good club suit, even though he is minimum in terms of hcp|pg||
nt|szalay:  not really, they r from Szeged and few pairs from Pecs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: S wants to compete but the majors are behind her so she gives up|pg||

nt|pelu: 15 INP to Monaco |pg||
nt|MolvaM: no so easy if east ducks|pg||
nt|athene: north could have made life easier, perhaps, by doubling 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: but he finds the heart anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: some play a double of these transfer responses as some sort of takeout double anyway|pg||
nt|athene: for example after nebulous 1@C - 1@H [spades], X = diamonds and hearts, and 1@S = clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|athene: but without special agreements of that sort i would have thought double would just be hearts and 1@S would be takeout, the same as after a transfer over 1nt|pg||
nt|szalay:  Mr. Zsak is teacher of Szeged bridge, he was teacher of Mr. Cseho of other table when he attended Faculty of Medicine there. as u know: he is my psychiatrist:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: even 6@h a good save over 4@s:)|pg||

nt|davpro: Defense better take their tricks at once...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: north really bid his hand to the limit:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27 teams from group-A will qualify for the knockouts. and 5 teams from group-B|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might try ducking in dummy and dropping the @H10 to induce north to lay down the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: but that would only work if south would lead the @H9 from @H9xx|pg||
nt|szalay:  as u know: we, Hungarians try to avoid D lead vs NT|pg||
nt|athene: D = doubleton or diamond?|pg||
nt|szalay:  diamond|pg||
pc|c8|nt|MolvaM: 15 how? 5s cant be made I think|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|eamongall: this is table 13 of 15 in play tables and 3rd line from bottom of scoresheet |pg||
pc|sT|nt|jbgood: but difficult to think that prd has 5 spades (and a @c void...)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: if he unblocks the @SAK he can't get to his clubs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: sorry 5@S down 1 - so only 7 IMP|pg||
nt|szalay:  time for hoping up|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can all see @DK, heart gets the job done|pg||
nt|athene: but not so easy for south|pg||
nt|szalay:  I dont see any layout when small is the correct card|pg||
nt|athene: his partner might have singleton @DQ for example|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed not|pg||
nt|szalay:  he knows pd's cards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bagman: Now E can ruff the diamond and try the heart to the K|pg||
nt|eamongall: Most pairs move to the table of the pair below them next ... ie 12 goes where 11 used to be |pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: no - then the 7 for his known strenth|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|MolvaM: wow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: amazingly 5s was made. cant see how|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the 2NT bid denied four diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|szalay:  and dummy play is a hint as well|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bagman: The heart attempt is likely to fail as N has shown @DA and @CK already|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|szalay:  nice defence, anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h7|nt|bagman: but there was nothing better to try|pg||
nt|athene: if so, that is another example of how much easier you make life for the defence when you tell them exactly what declarer has|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|davpro: From declarer view E has got 2+@c, so @c to T is the only thing that might work|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bagman: NS currently the 7th; EW about that much from the bottom|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1:50 am in California?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: Normal game, but slated for defeat|pg||
nt|pelu: no problem for defense down 1|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|dburn: game on a little bit more than the club finesse, so reasonable enough vulnerable|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: down one? mabe down two if South shifts to clubs|pg||
nt|kit: a lot more than the club finesse it looks like to me|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: true - the club spots aren't that good, so he does need more than just the queen onside|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer must have queen of clubs on, and with correct defense would have to guess whether to play North for Q9 or AQ|pg||
nt|dburn: and he may go down more than one even without a club shift, since he'll need to tackle the suit before all the trumps are drawn|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: Best play is to lead jack, so if it goes queen, king, South may be induced to take ace if he has it|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|pelu: normal play @C to 9 and 10, and then no @c-ruff|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: Of course with Greco a passed hand this is all moot -- he can't have ace of clubs, so play Hampson for AQ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: normal play may be for North to go up with @cA and play another - then he will get a ruff|pg||

nt|kit: Good point David -- North has nothing to lose by doing that since if declarer has K10 doubleton he would never misguess|pg||
nt|dburn: a big swing to Hungary, who played an adventurous 4@h rather than a safe 3@d on board 5|pg||
nt|kit: I think if defense plays diamonds here, declarer's communication gets tangled and he will go down 2.|pg||
nt|dburn: and found hearts 3-2, diamonds 2-2 with the king onside, scored 650, and took the lead|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: on a club lead north could rise ace and play another :) now declarer might finesse as his only chance to make|pg||
nt|athene: thinking north might have @CAQx and be trying to scare him out of a winning play|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer was sure about 7 tricks and had a shot for 9 (diamonds 3-3); he did not want to try anything in hearts because he might have lost 4 spade tricks|pg||

pc|hT|nt|szalay:  I think 1N is a tipical underbid by underdogs vs, world classes|pg||
nt|szalay:  at least 2N is sufficient|pg||
nt|athene: well, the problem is you know you don't want to play in 2nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has seen his pard's overcalls before|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|athene: you want to play in 1nt or 3nt or a diamond partscore|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|barbyh: could have heldthem to 1 less|pg||
nt|bagman: There is a theory, which states that against blind 3NT one should lead from the worse 4-carder from a 4432|pg||
nt|barbyh: against matchpoints or imps?|pg||
nt|bagman: both|pg||
nt|bagman: I don't subscribe to that theory but I was told that it was backed up by a huge simulation|pg||
nt|eamongall: The good news for McGann on the last board is some 3NT+2 company is appearing ...|pg||
nt|bagman: who knows; at least it makes leading easy|pg||
nt|barbyh: true, |pg||
nt|barbyh: well in this case lead from a club and you holdthemto 4|pg||

nt|jbgood: and cards lie badly for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator - Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Murat and Peter  for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok last board of the match|pg||
nt|MolvaM: next match to start in 29 minutes|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator - Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Murat and John for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw D-S squeeze is very unlikely|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry dont agree|pg||
nt|szalay:  to be honest|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|MolvaM: now 28 :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|bagman: EW can make here 10 tricks in NT on a club lead 11 tricks otherwise|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 more matches will be played tomorrow and then 27 teams from group A, and 5 teams from group B will proceed to the knockouts|pg||
nt|athene: Fantunes are sort of forced to play weak notrump as a consequence of the rest of their system|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay:  if u know your pd is so weak for weak NT u wd pass|pg||
nt|szalay:  some players have this "magic talent", others not|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they reach 4@S now north will have all the info he needs to axe|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: What have I missed in the bidding?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tomorrow we start at 10.00 hrs CET|pg||
nt|roswolf: these 2 teams will surely be in contention|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay:  this partnership has this "talent"|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has heard the warning bell|pg||
nt|athene: east simply discounted his @CQ on the bidding, so he is left with a nine-count|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that was fine judgment|pg||
nt|szalay:  as I watched many times: they r frequently agressive when pd has good hand, and passive when has bad one...we call it: "magican"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|pelu: only 8 trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bagman: E bid 3NT to show the spade stopper in case W was interested in that; If W had a huge @H raise, he would not pass 3NT|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed a M?|pg||
nt|davpro: 2@d balanced hand , 3@c a major, 4@d ask major  (according to a kib)|pg||
nt|jbgood: probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little optimistic but a fair shot|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|pelu: @S-lead would have given the 9. trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: normal lead actually but sometimes people dont like to lead from 5 small minors and choose a major|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jbgood: the curse of underleading aces|pg||
nt|davpro: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still down|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|pelu: but the good old rule 4. best in yout longest suit :) - and here East has indicatet 4 card @s|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right peter :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: specs tell me board 17 was doubled in other room|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to run the diamonds hoping for too many heart discards|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if thats the case 5 imps more could go to monaco-Z |pg||
nt|roswolf: restart in 15-20mins|pg||
pc|c6|nt|runnerup: killing lead |pg||
nt|MolvaM: well we shall see|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the juniors have been brushed aside|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|davpro: Does S know who has got the @d 4?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: spade switch was needed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start in 22mins approx from now|pg||
nt|pelu: no X when I see the bidding in OR (direct on the tabler)|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the ace and diamond up looks plausible|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: for results http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you just want to make sure of two heart tricks and if the finesses loses you might not even get two|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw first 27 from swiss A, first 5 from swiss B go to KO|pg||
nt|athene: but losing finesse doesn't matter here anyway with the nice breaks in the red suits|pg||
nt|szalay:  and first 8 has the right to choose opps from 9-32|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|bagman: There's no legitimate squeeze but it costs nothing to try|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now the defensive spade trick vanishes|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes which was why it was a fair shot|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|davpro: I need some sleep. Thx all kibs for pointing out my stupidity|pg||
nt|dburn: I doubt he cares all that much about the four, given what happened to the ace|pg||
nt|szalay:  the ranking order 9-32 is decided by NOT the result, but WBF/EBL masterpoints|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|pelu: nice discarding by NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes careful|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|jbgood: bye all|pg||
nt|davpro: bye all. I enjoyed as always.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: the last rites|pg||
nt|pelu: same start in OR - the first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now see you back in 20mins|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|bagman: N knew that S has the @CK as E had passed|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|szalay:  this is the (one of) reason why u find players in rosters who dont play|pg||
