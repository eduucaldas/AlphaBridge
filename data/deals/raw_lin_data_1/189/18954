mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: But the hand can be well described on the second round, given space.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Two kibitzers query that Madala Duboin play together. I assume the names are right.|pg||
nt|granguru:  they are|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can ruff a 4th round of spades high.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: 3rd round|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Singleton diamond is also an attractive switch and North quite rightly prefers that.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: North is Sementa, operator|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Madala is Bocchi's partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can guess that the @DK is offside, after the overcall and will have to rely on the club finesse.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl1: sry|pg||

nt|jfaria:  hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|kirp:  ok looks we r ready|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hi all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  hello |pg||
nt|royhughes: Welcome Sunil, Joao|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Gerben42:  welcome back in Poznan|pg||
nt|davpro: Morning all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes   h   missing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult grand to bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems bochi plays in both rooms :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: Ola Joao, Hi all|pg||
nt|kirp:  interesting hand to start off with, NS in @Hs, EW in @Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup: here norht has 5-6 -majors and opened-now ew shoud find 5 @d that is the goal let see|pg||
nt|glen: the problem with 4@C is that 3NT is no longer possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|glen: the good news is that W can't show both majors as over 3@C|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|hawe45:  A splinter in North would do fine - in later defense|pg||
nt|jfaria:  ola Danilo|pg||
nt|granguru:  brogeland for Angelini team and zapadinski for Mirage arrived|pg||
nt|glen: with the @D layout, 5@C loses a @S and two @Ds|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|davpro: Thx operator. It looked like an forcing pass-opening :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|runnerup: this is 200 -not enought but ..|pg||
nt|toral5: hello all|pg||
nt|toral5: so we start with a cracker|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: Who is Brogeland playing with?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty operator|pg||
nt|kirp:  they need to take ruff quickly or 4@H makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  intersting hand to start off with|pg||
nt|granguru:  this is round 6/7 of swiss stage in poznan, Poland|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like down 1 or 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: Ah- there the name came|pg||
nt|runnerup: @s ruff needed|pg||
nt|granguru:  Looks like precision system in NS |pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  You have seen too manu bad overcalls, when you sell out with the North hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: missing the @DQ they have to diagnose they have extra trump length to compensate|pg||
nt|kirp:  dangerous hand as 5@D makes EW|pg||
nt|glen: in 5@S there is a loser in each suit, and a @H ruff possible|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Joao and Roy|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hi Sunil and Roy|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@d bal ?|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW have doubled the opponents at a rather low level here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think 2@d may show a strong bal hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kirp:  looks like both pairs play some version of Precision @C|pg||
nt|glen: 5-over-5 bids have approximately a 90% chance of being wrong (you should have doubled instead)|pg||
nt|toral5: hi petur|pg||
nt|toral5: peter|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jfaria:  routine 4@s 4 those 2|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards lie 5@D is down 2|pg||
nt|pelu: so same contract in both rooms|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  south hand is known as Bridge World Death Hand (BWDH)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  invitational values with 3-card support for partner|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a nice hand with spade values and N has an easy raise to game with 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has built a trap - will remove to 5 @H, only losing 100 I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is there a reward for "slowest bid hand of the tournament" - without special reason...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello all|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Zaleski needs some results tocach up the playoffs |pg||
pc|d7|nt|Gerben42:  with Qxxxx x Axxx xxx North would pass and 4@S would be cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt played the other way round - no spade lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|danilo1: 4@S will make (prob. +1) .. .in ev. 5@D, declarer needs to guess @H (must play 9 from hand) for -2 |pg||
nt|runnerup: very dangerous I wander if 3nt was to play or some minors|pg||
nt|rv: Hi specs, warm regards from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42:  but there is normally no perfect answer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What a nice board to start with. South must play East for the @C Ace - or West for the same card single or double...! And 5 @H is fine|pg||
nt|toral5: and 5s is a mek|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 tricks are on ice here|pg||
nt|roswolf: players names will be up in a mo|pg||
nt|jbgood: going through the motions|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 controls and west will ask for the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Hans, all|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Ilya and Hans|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-lead, small @S back to defeat 5 @H|pg||
nt|jfaria:  kind of 18-20|pg||
nt|royhughes: Then presumably the double was for takeout|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: has to set up @Cs|pg||
nt|royhughes: East is in a tough spot here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wud it hv been better to take @Sa and run @C(|pg||
nt|jfaria:  if so, hard for W to bid something after O second round|pg||
pc|s7|nt|runnerup: looks dangerous -all tricks possible|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed 4@s and E might have shown 4@h. I don't know their system :(|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@C could have been made NS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: didnt bother played his pard for 3+ diamonds or the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D may yhave promised 3+diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @S suit was hidden by N|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: who can hold Qxx diamonds? thats the question|pg||
nt|kirp:  S must be disappinted that dummy has all 3 missing trumps|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jfaria:  TO|pg||
pc|dK|nt|glen: however the reason for that 90% is often just a small problem in the layout of the cards that defeats the contract|pg||
nt|rv: 4@d is namyats, 8.5+ tricks with @s as trumps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: only problem is the potential 3-0 trump break|pg||
nt|roswolf: doesnt matter here:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does the lead tell any story|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: puppet i think - then 3@d shows 1 or 2 4 card majors, and deny 5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - and therefore the dbl by N a bit speculative|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  13 tricks - over|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  or 12|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: One of the answers is to use an artificial tool to separate hands with 3 card spades and those with 0-2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 6 is down with @H lead|pg||
nt|davpro: y- that was my guess too|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: then responder bids the suit he doesnt have |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|royhughes: I think Sunil may be right that going after clubs is better|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru:  Gomerov's X is a risky one...with 6@c and the void it is almost sure partner is waiting for a x to be converted|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|runnerup: y a big swing for Joker to start|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like down 2 however|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N looked ambiguous to me|pg||
nt|royhughes: It is a complicated hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|danilo1: both teams ... actually, this is the last table in grop A|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Funny hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: funny for N/S |pg||
nt|hawe45:  1590 - a score not seen so often...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jfaria:  since 4@h went down EW can collect some plus|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice hand to start with|pg||
nt|royhughes: Indeed|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c4|nt|mcarroll: Hi RV|pg||
pc|d3|nt|granguru:  yes 3NT makes easily|pg||
nt|kirp:  same result in OR|pg||
nt|kirp:  and identical auction|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|davpro: Declarer can count to 9. Lets see if he tries for more|pg||
nt|davpro: nope|pg||
nt|jbgood: he actually had 10 from the top if n really discarded 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rv: Texan Aces have a fantastic record in this event, they have won silver and bronze medals in last couple of editions|pg||
nt|rv: Zimmerman (Monaca Z) are one of the pre-tourney favorties and consist of multiple world champions|pg||

pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C non-forcing is not a method that I like. It means you have to start with a double on a good hand with clubs. (Or some other artificiality)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Double has left Duboin in a quandary. Perhaps 2@S would have been enough on the second round.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|brolucius: South can bear in mind that North has not raised the spades and he has four hearts to dispose of.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|blum1956: This method has also sometimes is not bad - a NF hand comes more often than a forcing one|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: I played it for a while and hated it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can get pre-empted when you have a good hand and cannot show your suit early.|pg||
nt|blum1956: In Russia we almost all play 2nd level NF|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|brolucius: But now East will have no safe play, it seems.|pg||
mc|9|nt|brolucius: Yes, quite pretty at the end. And they survive at the 3@S level.|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SAQJ863HK864DA8CQ,S974H92D32CAJ8652,ST2HT7DQT9654CKT4,SK5HAQJ53DKJ7C973|sv|n|nt|eamongall: Here defence need to find the @C ruff in time to beat 4@Hs |pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 or 11 tricks operator?|pg||
nt|davpro: there was actually 12 to take (double dummie)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: solid start for the dutch|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good start|pg||
nt|roswolf: a fortuitous start for angelini|pg||
nt|roswolf: hu bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi bill:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: more spice here|pg||
nt|kirp:  1st board is not a nice way to wake up in the match|pg||
nt|kirp:  slam in @Cs available here|pg||
nt|granguru:  6NT 6@s 6@c EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  6NT best contract|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@S worst one|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think he might have done a bit better establishing clubs, but it is very complex|pg||
mb|1H|nt|davpro: 10 point all around. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Peter and Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello|pg||
nt|athene: without the @DA Nunes would likely have led fourth best|pg||
nt|granguru:  do u enter S?|pg||
nt|glen: W might start with Multi if that's available, or a 2@S weak two, or pass|pg||
nt|rv: North is G.Venkatesh, popularly known as Texas and based out of US, rest of team members from India|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if @Cjx or qx was with west there were chances of making |pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: with 6/5 and only 1 defencive trick normally better to play in attack|pg||
nt|danilo1: strang - when we look in names here|pg||
nt|granguru:  red vs green?|pg||
nt|glen: N has a flat hand, best to pass, and it make go all pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3NT - and hard work|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: perhaps east should take it away -he has got support in hearts so ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: Angelini seems to be in the A Swiss almost no matter what happens in this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand for n/s to bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: these guys have good nerves,but average players can shake a bit after start like this|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@C relay FG I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|davpro: y and Mossop will need a good result to joij them|pg||
nt|roswolf: fulvio has seen his pard's bids before|pg||
nt|glen: *may go|pg||
nt|glen: S is in there with a X, not sure what the next bid would be if N bids 3@D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kirp:  conservative pass by W|pg||
nt|royhughes: A kibitzer told me the West player's name is spelled Cem|pg||
mb|3C|nt|davpro: *join|pg||
nt|jbgood: 24 vps to Mossop |pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 from each group to A - the others to B|pg||
nt|pelu: hard decision by S - 4@H is down 1 and 5@c also down 1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c looks good|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 5@c making - only defense is @H lead and the @S - kill the entry for the 4. @D|pg||
nt|jfaria:  5! still cheap if opps bid game|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT does well on a @S lead|pg||
nt|glen: not as good on a @D lead|pg||
nt|rv: best for both sides to stay low here, all suits and cards lying wrong|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Stay low - double-dummy North might make 4 @S on a @H-lead and -ruff|pg||
nt|rv: North might bite the bullet and pass here|pg||
nt|pelu: but a make if u duck @D first time and play @C from S's hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s will prevail i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  About 12 tricks again - but lucky and only in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jxxx in @D are very much - the double by Versace means balanced hand value in @S - Zaleski can reopen|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Zapadinski is playing at both tables. Could you please check, operator?|pg||
nt|kirp:  not sure it is a relay, artificial and GF yes, now natural|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@s suit 3@C suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  Angelini deciding to bid 4@C passint the 3N barrier|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: kibs rush in to tell me that if defence plays spades 5c cant make|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s finess off so no game on|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like game 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: then 27 from A and 5 from B go on to the KO stage|pg||
nt|davpro: They found a 6-1 fit instead of the 6-0 fit. On level higher though|pg||
nt|pelu: has to take 3x@C befor @D|pg||
nt|kirp:  no blackwood here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  wrong|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eamongall: the non-vul Townsend might venture an insurance 4@Hs |pg||
nt|jbgood: but I think a black suit or even NT play better than @ds|pg||
nt|davpro: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: some sort of short suit trial bid?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: following the law, S has passed and west has competed with 6 @Cs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: we see all 4 hands but sometimes at the table it is not obvious to shift to spades|pg||
nt|danilo1: 5@C is on ... and good to avoid 4@H, that is tempting in 4-3 fit (single @S on 3-card side)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Lech|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but since 3 ! is a bit too high no problem for NS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: so 2@C forcing one round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best lead: @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - NORTH is declarer... - wake up|pg||
nt|pelu: yes defense has to kill @SA|pg||
nt|glen: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda7.html|pg||
nt|glen: top 27 teams in Swiss A, and top 5 in Swiss B play tomorrow|pg||
nt|glen: here we have  25 against  29 in a likely elimination match|pg||
nt|glen: W is thinking, why did my partner play the beer card (@D7)?|pg||
nt|glen: is it because of the beer garden just outside|pg||
nt|glen: it couldn't be fourth best, could it?|pg||
nt|glen: E is thinking, I led fourth best, what's the problem|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: south wont get in much to lead trumps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would also make on the @S-lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead small @S possible but @H equivalent - many use to overcall 1@S in West to give the lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with weak 5332 i agree to pass like Versace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But an overcall would put the contract in South, so...|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing really helps,but contracts should have been by south this time -by n= -if spade lead,but now 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the option between @H and @S lead is a typical problem in bridge|pg||
nt|kirp:  surprise pass by both!|pg||
nt|granguru:  Angelini learns lessons..not passed this time..(as he did once with 10HCP)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eamongall: Now defence need to get active |pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4s has good chances|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
nt|granguru:  Angelini probably showed no first red control a singleton @c support and good @s not more than 5|pg||
nt|kirp:  hard to get to NT played by E, never sure of 7th @C|pg||
pc|s7|nt|MolvaM: with trump Kx inside and clubs 3-3 and the @dK safe|pg||
nt|lechcold: hello|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: and wont necessarily lead one anyway:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - wrong table:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe 2 |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 1 in Open - playing 5@S|pg||
nt|rv: good defense by Balicki here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Actually @D-lead would have worked better for the defense|pg||
nt|rv: @d lead might have been better for defense|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3@c|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, NS certainly do not belong at the three level and 3@c should go down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eamongall: still time |pg||
nt|bagman: N has to duck the @HK if W plays a low heart|pg||
nt|bagman: Both N and S know that there are no spade tricks to make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even in the case of a spade shift, stuurman has to be very careful to keep all his diamonds and let his spade honor go|pg||
nt|pelu: also 3Nt in Or , but no @Dbid form East - and @H-lead from W - now easy|pg||
nt|pelu: but a strange lead @D was unbid suit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bridge_one: i prefere to lead in the suit more solid, but without a solid suit i prefere the lead from small cards - but is is only a opinion|pg||
nt|jbgood: NT is more flexible than 3@d|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bagman: They also see the clubs so they can make extra tricks only from trumps|pg||
nt|glen: spec tells me they may play 3/5 leads|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||
nt|kirp:  win 1 imp|pg||
nt|royhughes: Well judged all around, I think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kirp:  ty, thought N would bit it|pg||
nt|granguru:  if 5@H over 5@C there was a chance...|pg||
nt|rv: maybe @SQ was better at trick 2 instead of another @c|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: a stronger defence was diamond lead, heart back, then another diamond|pg||
nt|rv: now down with rounded suit overruffs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Getting to hand a problem for S, ruffing earlier @C wd have worked better|pg||
nt|rv: excellent defense by Balicki, Keyzad could have possibly scored contract if he had played @SQ at trick 2|pg||
nt|rv: on accurate defense 2 @c over-ruffs and 2 @h ruffs including @SK trump promotion|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: Open room have just got to the same contract|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: West is Cem Tokay and not Sem|pg||
pc|h6|nt|runnerup: ok inspite off 9 points north desided to pass 3 -right this time -perhaps 3 small trumps and too balanced nd not vulnerable  make that|pg||
nt|kirp:  stopped in 3@S in OR, |pg||
nt|runnerup: no he raised --ok|pg||
nt|toral5: back.was away|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rv: I don't think he can still make contract, can see only 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbgood: an imaginative E might bid 3@c then:)|pg||
nt|glen: in which case dropping the beer card on the table was wrong|pg||
nt|rv: even if Keyzad plays @SA and @SQ, he has only 9 tricks to the best of my analyses|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kirp:  N's QJ of @Cs were too good to stop in 3|pg||
nt|runnerup: so -5|pg||
nt|kirp:  in OR, W overcalled, hence any finesse rated to lose|pg||
nt|pelu: when u have QJ x and no 10's or 9'2 normal the best play is to play up to the low H's|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|eamongall: At another table McGann Brown have reached the happy position of having 3 vulnerable doubled undertricks available against 4@S ...they still have to collect them |pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: hi john|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi john|pg||
nt|danilo1: good play .. 2 Dummy entries for (if needed) repeated @H finess|pg||
nt|rv: super defense by Balicki|pg||
nt|toral5: should try @S now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Gerben42:  going plus got to be worth something|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so far +100 is almost worth everything|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if Madala is N then S is Rimstedt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  operator please correct S name?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: i think finesse in @C give more % at declarer|pg||
nt|toral5: low @C now means a @C blockage cos @D will be shooted|pg||
nt|toral5: @D return is good now|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR @H-lead to A and then they wait 5 min for the next card from East :) 8O. Herbst)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: the dutch duly gained 11 imps by bidding the grand|pg||
nt|kirp:  so chalk this pickup due to sound overcalls|pg||
nt|toral5: after a 1@D oc,@H ace is a marked card with jassem.so only hope for declarer is @H ace stiff|pg||

nt|MolvaM: here is the link to running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: interesting 3NT call by north in the other room|pg||
nt|runnerup: look 1nt / ns|pg||
nt|granguru:  1 imp for the overtrick|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@S EW depending on the @DK winning or not.|pg||
nt|rv: Balicki made 2 key plays, duck @CQ and return low @d when in with @SK, Keyzad still had a chance to ruff a @h and exit in @DJ instead of @CA and @c ruff|pg||
nt|toral5: no.9 only|pg||
nt|royhughes: Did South return a heart -- that looks like an error|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another double fit for both sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: EW are currently 4th fighting for a medal|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  the polish Club|pg||
nt|toral5: part score battle coming up|pg||
nt|jfaria:  1nt upgradable if 15-17 by N|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: Balicki was end-played when in with @dj if Keyzad had found play|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks like a peaceful 3 NT by N|pg||
nt|jbgood: or S for that matter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tokay-baldursson at the open room is a very new partnership which might explain why they couldnt find the grand|pg||
nt|athene: certainly a bit of a gamble but it paid off very nicely this time|pg||
nt|runnerup: east is not tesyed because north stoles hearts|pg||
nt|granguru:  weak  by N1NT |pg||
nt|jbgood: hi all|pg||
nt|granguru:  weak 1NT by N|pg||
nt|kirp:  unlikely to get to game now|pg||
nt|glen: 2@C is likely for the majors or some other two suited convention|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like OR found the way to make this, defence not as good as here, E played @CK at trick 2|pg||
nt|rv: great hand for defense and declarer play|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kirp:  rescue redbld|pg||
nt|granguru:  may have specific types of hands|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice 1 @D - natural?|pg||
nt|rv: yes North-South play 2/1 based methods|pg||
nt|rv: East-West play Polish @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: looks like routine 4@H|pg||
nt|royhughes: These competitive partscore deals can be difficult|pg||
mb|2S|nt|runnerup: normal 4 @h = with no other ideas -from anyone -looks like it ,but..|pg||
nt|granguru:  2-suited continous is one|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@c asks |pg||
nt|granguru:  2@D = @d+@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: W's pass in this context is usually forcing|pg||
nt|jbgood: but not sure with angelini|pg||
nt|granguru:  accepting 1NT xx eventually|pg||
nt|rv: Zmud has passed judiciously before Venkatesh started doubling|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  E should dble 2@C|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bagman: Rimsted clearly gambling with her heart suit|pg||
nt|davpro: yes. 9 easy tricks, but not the best communications...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 nt - 2 @h - 2 NT - 3 NT?|pg||
nt|toral5: what would have been a dbl by martens on 2h?|pg||
nt|toral5: never penalties.right?|pg||
nt|lechcold: heart lead was devastating for declarer, but impossible to find|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  some would call it practical :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all colors taked by weak players :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North bid both, @D and @H|pg||
nt|jfaria:  another routine game|pg||
nt|kirp:  a @H lead is not good for defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  N has 3 trix in the suit|pg||
nt|kirp:  as now S can pass|pg||
nt|rv: I presume the first 2 deals had an effect on Keyzad to open this hand, he might have not opened normally|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 2 flat also -1|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and so will reach 4@S|pg||
nt|royhughes: If it is a partscore -- NS might make more|pg||
mb|4S|nt|MolvaM: misfit hand but contract seems makable|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible here perhaps|pg||
nt|jfaria:  at least for us looking at 4 hands|pg||
nt|kirp:  this will challenge N in the play|pg||
nt|granguru:  took his time |pg||
nt|jbgood: but again - this prdship is not of very firm construction - so ....|pg||
nt|granguru:  he "knew" S was going to say 2@d|pg||
nt|jfaria:  i believe they will bid 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Poor North - he thinks, he is facing an opening bid...|pg||
nt|lechcold: now 9 tricks I think|pg||
nt|toral5: is he making?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@S would not be great here even with the @D9|pg||
nt|kirp:  @Ds are sitting wrong or maybe right given lack of entries to N|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|athene: the point being, on a club lead, you have to draw trumps and then cash four hearts to discard a club from the north hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: they might go down here|pg||
nt|glen: declarer knows where the @S ace, but where is the @S jack|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 x 16 in the finals on Wednesday|pg||
pc|c6|nt|MolvaM: the first non-alert after 3 rounds of bidding :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N hand looks nothing like minimum to play in @s |pg||
nt|jfaria:  both rooms thought the same|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: N should know that the @c king counts for full - and bid 3 imo|pg||
nt|kirp:  S is happy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|davpro: They stopped low, but if @ds are not 3-3 a higher contract would be a struggle|pg||
nt|kirp:  now N has a problem|pg||
nt|granguru:  a terrible contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: W will not be|pg||
nt|kirp:  100 a trick|pg||
nt|kirp:  i make down 3|pg||
nt|granguru:  1@s 2@h 2@D 1@c|pg||
nt|granguru:  but may be only -2|pg||
nt|jbgood: E should ask himself why E didnt jump in hearts (or bid them directly) - because he had 2 suits:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  not easy lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|danilo1: @CQ lead may create some playing options ... cashing 2 @H immediatelly may be loosing option|pg||
nt|granguru:  if @c help to discard|pg||
nt|rv: I might have slightly devalued and re-opened 1n with North hand instead of double of 1@s|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I think the North cards are very suitable|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru:  now -2 as said|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: although the bidding thus far is cloaked in mystery they seem to be powering into it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42:  with a bit more fortune it would have been a claimer|pg||
nt|bagman: In pairs it might not be that practical as the bonus for the game is not that big as in teams|pg||
nt|granguru:  no no|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  S ruffs @cq but loses a natural trump trick |pg||
nt|granguru:  no fast entry in S hand to cross @D|pg||
nt|glen: odds are still the 1NT bidder has it, so he picks up the trump suit|pg||
nt|glen: E can win this or the next to switch to @Ds for his ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duck this @D could be a idea|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gives the same result, if South plays safe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but give at south the chance to fault|pg||
nt|danilo1: well done|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: 4@S MIGHT BE FINIS|pg||
nt|roswolf: and it is not sure what happened there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at the other table, tokay asked for keycards and then asked for the trump queen apparently. why??|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well if u open the north hand 1@C a 1 NT rebid wd be a gross underbid... so open 1 nt|pg||
nt|royhughes: The lie of the cards is very friendly to declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Absolutely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on the previous board|pg||
nt|athene: actually i guess it would be ok (provided the hearts come in)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: 27 teams from A and 5 from B go to the KO stage - with no carry over|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye is used to playing tough contracts - but most often there is a glimmer of hope to win:) not so here|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: the @D-lead gave S a fine tempo|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kirp:  that looks like 6 trix for declarer|pg||
nt|granguru:  19 teams are playing for Poland|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west was somewhat stuck for a good lead|pg||
nt|pelu: 110 = 9 IMP for Monaco|pg||
nt|runnerup: trying to help parner well done -now surely down|pg||
nt|jfaria:  maybe leading the singleton with 4 trumps not hte best choice|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jfaria:  claim is near|pg||

mb|2N|nt|granguru:  7@S in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: same defence in other room |pg||
nt|athene: their 2-level openers are 10-13 and only really, really huge 9-counts qualify|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H is limited at 9 hcp 3 cards raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3rd slam hand in a row?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  better in @d|pg||
nt|danilo1: if ev. 6@S ... @C lead or @H and @C switch may be vital|pg||
nt|danilo1: *is vital for defense|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... rite contract (unbeatable) is not 6@S ... but 6@D ... guess difficult to come there |pg||
nt|runnerup: so double for takeout -problems in bidding by west perhaps|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure well bid to get to the grand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And good for time schedule also|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: you have to guess well to make 4 @h -but that is bedt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A poor 4 @H - but you might be forced to "guess" right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East is evaluating what bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: this @d lead asked may help to get rid off spade looser|pg||
nt|jbgood: choice between dbl and 1 NT...|pg||
nt|jbgood: pass never an option for Boye on a near opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: lebensohl is heading n/s into danger here|pg||
nt|athene: well, whether he can or not, he didn't|pg||

nt|toral5: ouch.@S jack hiding for me:(|pg||
nt|toral5: what is 2nt opening for ew?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2 very flat hands, so no good play for 6NT (6@c)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  normal @d lead|pg||
nt|jfaria:  and N has litle options to win|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: east will leap high|pg||
nt|MolvaM: leader board and running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: but is it high enough|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you redouble in these auctions you help opps because they now have more room to scramble for the best fit|pg||
nt|toral5: seems they play 2nt opening=minors weak|pg||
nt|pelu: polish @c here|pg||
nt|royhughes: Difficult hand -- it may be interesting to see if declarer can get to dummy with the spade 10|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jbgood: but defense may start with 3 spades and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where south needs discipline|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW play a strong @C, so this shows points|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: not any more|pg||
nt|davpro: 8 quick tricks for defense here on a spade lead. 7 for declarer on that lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 7 th in the bag|pg||
nt|athene: also you warn them with borderline hands to stay low|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S WHATEVER IT MEANS SEEM OVER THE TOP - WEST SHAPENS HIS AXE|pg||
nt|athene: so here for example if west had redoubled, south might well have decided his partner didn't have what was needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: sharpens|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@c must be @d |pg||
pc|dK|nt|MolvaM: lets see if they can locate the missing @d control|pg||
nt|roswolf: they should do|pg||
nt|roswolf: the flexible double|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch is comming|pg||
nt|toral5: did he really bid 3nt with 21?|pg||
nt|lechcold: I believe Martens-Jassem play strong club when NV|pg||
nt|pelu: well done by Martens - Jassem hasa absolut max for a passed hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bagman: Declarer needs to ruff the heart losers and discard a club on a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  UNDO|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade honors not so attractive for madala|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well be passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has nothing to cue and has soft club values|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kirp:  I think pass followed ny pass or 3N would have been better bid by E|pg||
nt|rv: this could be one of the worst possible draw for Texan Aces, they started tourney very well and topped their group consisting of Bessis, Payne and qualified for Swiss A with 3 VPs ...|pg||
nt|rv: c/o|pg||
nt|royhughes: He has finesses in hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: they dont have a lot of hcp to spare|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR NS in 6@H - looks like S gave a false cue bid in @D - but it was an artifical bidding over 6 round|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow thats enterprising|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the italians are merciful|pg||
nt|kirp:  not well bid here|pg||
nt|kirp:  thought this was a strong club auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: most pairs have bid to 7 - but a few rested in six, and even fewer in game|pg||
nt|glen: this lead will not trouble declarer too much|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|MolvaM: in another table north could go with J2N and that might be a problem|pg||
nt|danilo1: exactelly ... if Alfredo decides to try more than 4@S ... he will not bid Diamonds :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I believe 4@C was just cue|pg||
nt|jfaria:  456 kibs tell me 4@c is just a cue |pg||
nt|jfaria:  being a cue, no way to reach @d :(|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Not likely as we only have 285 here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: i am told they are in slam in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he still likes his hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  just a figure of speach :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: NS have done very well to enter bidding ... if South pass, EW would have time to find @D |pg||
pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: well even if diamonds are not led. no way to get rid of the 2 losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: and that is enough for norberto:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does 4s have any specific meaning?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just an old fashioned cue?|pg||
nt|rv: they lost a bit of steam in Swiss A with lacklustre performance and could finish only 21st with 107 VPs after 7 rounds, that performance has contributed tough draw here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|runnerup: no fight now just posible over tricks |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i want to bid on and i have a spade control|pg||
nt|roswolf: the latter|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems an easy-ish make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bagman: The @DA must be with E: if W has it, then E has the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But how can you play bridge - NOT leading partners suit with Ace-x???|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You MUST have seen too many bad overcalls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: try both finesses and hope that the @d10 takes care of itself|pg||
nt|roswolf: the pass of 4@S said dont lead one i am told:) so he follows his own suggestion:)|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Glen Ashton|pg||
nt|glen: hi|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hard to tell probably Lauria would treat is hand as single suited..|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: may be able to get @S entry for a rounded suit fin|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: very controles bidding here|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe enough here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's concern on a diamond shift is whether to finesse the @C9|pg||
nt|roswolf: now off|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: but i don't think he will|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  Happy Christmas now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: push hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks srange but no spade losers went away |pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps has been a better idea to pass and wait for partners d --but ofcause partner can pass too -but if y double partner never bids nt -because you have all spades|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he may get to dummy yes|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is a tough choice for declarer -- he does not want to lose a heart finesse here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now he has 2 hooks available|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but only chance to keep|pg||
nt|royhughes: If he wins the jack and plays a low spade, it looks like he can make it|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|glen: now careful not to use the @S Queen too early|pg||
nt|glen: 3@S + 2@H + 2@C + 2@D = making|pg||
nt|rv: in the last couple of editions of this event where they won silver and bronze resp, they did have favorable draws atleast in the initial k/o matches|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jbgood: as suggested Angeline bid and made 3 NT on the previous one|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I wont lead one :)|pg||
nt|athene: he might be considering whether to try to make the contract by playing east for the @HK|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but east's double is a warning|pg||
nt|danilo1: as I said before ... on Bd 12 - 4@H in 4-3 fit has been very tempting ... happened in OR - and 12 IMP for Allfrey|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: hi Glen|pg||
nt|glen: hi Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade best for defense now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: good defense to save an IMP|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange that N didnt try a big spade first...|pg||
nt|roswolf: draw trumps and take the diamonf hook|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can pull trumps and discard diamonds on clubs to ruff out the king|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which also works|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jfaria:  there he goes, "litle option" came alive |pg||
pc|c2|nt|glen: it takes a long time for "spade best" to go from Canada to Poland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes this is a very tough draw for them|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|bagman: Declarer wondering if he can throw E in for a club trick|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tough def for west... best wd have been to return @S... passive|pg||

nt|glen: declarer heading for home with 9 tricks|pg||

nt|bagman: NS can make a minor suit slam|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe EW have some Namyats type of device over 1m openings|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3N-2 was only worth 20%|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  last round not finished yet?|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can show real clubs, S hand becomes very valuable with the source of tricks, heart control and trump support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if it starts 1@C 4@H, what does S bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4NT perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: but E has a hand where she can prevent NS from changing that information. After 1@C, E can bid 4@H and then?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. tough if 1@C can be short (3 or even 2 cards)|pg||
nt|bagman: if 4NT shows primary diamonds and secondary clubs then it's the bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the problem with such a bid is - what will pd think it is|pg||
nt|bagman: I wouldn't be surprised if there are some other agreements for the meaning of 4NT|pg||
nt|bagman: or no agreements :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is an area where regular partnerships are ahead of the game|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@HX is 500; it's better than the vulnerable game for EW so they might take the sac|pg||
nt|runnerup: 11 in both tables and we though how to make 10|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me slam makable if no @d lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well if you can duck a diamond and then squeeze somebody afterwards :) maybe|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not sure if this play was superior|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: for running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: south could make 6 of a red suit here if only he could get to dummy twice (lead the @H7 picks the suit up)|pg||
nt|roswolf: there will be some fun and games here|pg||
nt|athene: sorry - of course he can do it|pg||
nt|athene: lead to @SA, and lead the small heart|pg||
nt|athene: then later get to dummy with a heart and lead a diamond to the queen|pg||
nt|athene: easy!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm perhaps not at the table -in the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: only needs east to have @HHx and @DKx|pg||
nt|roswolf: game not reached at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: hampson-greco playing precision so 1@D is nebulous|pg||
nt|athene: south can be very aggressive if he knows his partner actually has some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but not when it might just be two small|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed these kind of hands are horrible for strong club systems|pg||
nt|roswolf: or less bill|pg||
nt|athene: well it's at least a doubleton for them i think; they use 2@D for the short diamond hands|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: Nunes call director|pg||
nt|roswolf: short of bds!?or something wrong with the last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: becouse 2nt invit or forsing |pg||
nt|athene: hmmm - they are not happy about something from the previous board, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: ah - you mean nunes was told that 2NT was showing a good hand and that is why he didn't double?|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is anothe swing possibility|pg||
nt|danilo1: meant 6@D (@S)|pg||
nt|kirp:  score is really 25-10|pg||
nt|granguru:  a very expensive hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  which will most probably decide the winner of the match |pg||
nt|fabsayc: our postal system on rotating strikes|pg||
nt|glen: next door the other room tried the 5-2 @S fit, and ran into the 5-1 trump split|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Weak 2 from N?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hope not...!|pg||
nt|royhughes: and 6 imps toNS|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  something to be said for 5@H overcall too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in 4@H in other match one made one down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  5 @D N/S should end the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: wont make much difference anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns has a good score open room ew has some 2h to make|pg||
nt|rv: they need to strike in the first segment when Zimmerman is playing, no disrespect, but Helgemo-Helness is mch tougher proposition in second segment |pg||
mb|1D|nt|MolvaM: if trumps were 3-1 he would have to fall back on the @d hook|pg||
nt|granguru:  1 NT 13-15|pg||
nt|glen: that was 10 imps, bring this "elimination" match to a near tie|pg||
nt|jfaria:  partscore here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bagman: against a strong 1@C 5@H would be fine|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt also,but ew can bid more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We have seen such hand make 2 @H - and 6 @C...|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: 4@S here is the likely spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart partial would be sensible|pg||
nt|toral5: very thin 1@S oc|pg||
nt|toral5: but very common these days.5332 is often ignored:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@S very normal - would u pass? :)|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.i pass:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: being non vul... dont think EW will push|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 5@D can be beated with @S lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: no just loose that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|runnerup: small from table |pg||
nt|jbgood: some lucky day you make 6 @s on this lot - but not today|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt now? :) - he does have seven stoppers in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: the diamond suit now consigned to the dustbin|pg||
nt|athene: i bet a lot of partnerships don't know what a jump in 4th suit means|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. 3@D here - is that natural forcing, natural non-forcing, or what?|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is wrong with a natural 1@D RESPONSE?|pg||
nt|glen: peaceful 4@h here|pg||
nt|danilo1: NS need to stop on time (5@H still on time) ... ev. 4@S or 5@D by EW will be too expensive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3@d ends any slam mess in N/S intentions|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 3@h with North hand, here Venkatesh had bid 3@h as fit jump showing @hs+@cs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes shows the benefit of Muiderberg stle 2 suiter openings|pg||
nt|mcarroll: style|pg||
nt|jfaria:  best to play in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  should make this for push|pg||
nt|runnerup: true ew can not tough clubs so looser gous so @s later|pg||
nt|rv: I don't like to pass with such shapely hands with most of values in my longest suit, 3@h opening for me even at these colors |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south is sensible|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west also :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would have been interesting to watch 3@dX|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever bids a strong 7-card minor if they have a major of any description|pg||
nt|pelu: I am know as a solid overcaller - and I would bid 1@S 100 out of 100 - take the 1. level from opp nd suit ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: after pass at 5@C @S lead became possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lightner...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S ruff, K @C - declarer lose the ruff, one @C and A@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup he had the colors to help him|pg||
nt|athene: i think officially in SAYC a jump in 4th suit is defined as natural and invitational|pg||
nt|glen: ok, a quiet 5@H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@H must be a fit jump|pg||
nt|jfaria:  nt looks hugly with @h lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup: ok wrong hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No right hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many pair use pass at 5@C like OK to lead @C, instead DBL means to lead in another suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i don't know the gadget played by E/W|pg||
nt|jbgood: investigating for a club contract (slam?) and got no reaction of a positive kind |pg||
nt|jfaria:  now 7 tricks |pg||
pc|sT|nt|runnerup: so it was all academical|pg||
nt|glen: 1@H likely a transfer to @S, 1NT may have denied 3+@Ss|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you are going to play transfer advances, i think you have to open west hand with 1@D (polish+walsh style)|pg||
nt|toral5: i am an old book student of sound over calls|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bagman: Malinowski has very little defense and can hope that they go down only 3|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of those dark corners that no-one knows about|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1-5-7-0 will not be an obvious shape to the defenders|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is close however since singleton spade is an honour|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Then just face the facts - open 1 @H in North|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how to lead @H|pg||
nt|jfaria:  for ntrumpers|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: @SK to the ace, diamond finesse i guess|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess will not miss the jead after bidding :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  this should make 5, for no swing|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: now np|pg||
nt|MolvaM: trump lead effective stop a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni might stick the @DK in|pg||
nt|roswolf: but north made a normal if aggressive raise to the vul game|pg||
nt|danilo1: *lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: kibs - if u know EW-bidding then help us :)|pg||
nt|glen: the Qx of @C here is a help to 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the spade lead from north is strange however|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bagman: Good time to take the save; in pairs taking an 800 save against a making slam is not a way to win; normally you should take your chances and try to beat the slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: @d cue was what S did NOT want to get|pg||
nt|granguru:  last hand N knowing p had 4@s cards misvalued his hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now you were unable to tll partner, that you had such a suit|pg||
nt|rv: good start by Zmud here, best to force dummy in @s|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|davpro: But from Ns view; doesn't it seem as if S hasn't got a @h cue?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|pc|dA|nt|athene: now declarer is worried the @DQ might get ruffed, so he would like to lead a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: but entries are a bit on the short side|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: N looks to take no notice...|pg||
nt|jbgood: S bid well - N somewhat undiciplined - slam is more like a Roland one (which in the old days would be called a Norwegian slam)|pg||
nt|kirp:  q@C next?|pg||
nt|kirp:  knows S has another @S, so needs to take out entry|pg||
pc|d5|nt|davpro: This could take a while, but will end with 1 down...|pg||
nt|jbgood: If N has the @c Q in stead of the @d Q his hand would be better though|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: (unless the slam is such that everybody bids and makes it)|pg||
nt|pelu: also here, but if u pass this N's hand u sh find another game :):)|pg||
nt|toral5: agree pelu.thats y i m learning chess|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a hand like south's, your worst nightmare is getting forced, losing trump control|pg||
nt|glen: spec notes this board played in 6@D by Lavazza, and is also 6@D by Kamras|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|MolvaM: 2 slams equalized the score|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 4 "H seems to be NO winner, @S Ace and a small @S|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@S very normal, 10HCP, quite good intermediates in Spades|pg||

nt|granguru:  S knows finesse is not working. can establish @C but no fast entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  to throw @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so Roy cud have come back later hu Joao|pg||
nt|jfaria:  wlc b didnt loose much :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Here is a typical defensive bidding problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well now judgment comes into it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 level belongs to the opps :)|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to decide on 5-level|pg||
nt|roswolf: south tempted to bid 6?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zmud cant be sure of void spades so will probably pass|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C natural (ish), strong (ish) and forcing|pg||
nt|szalay:  N-S are a rare pair from Hungary: they r not from Budapest|pg||
nt|szalay:  from our Sun City, Szeged, and could improve a lot thx to BBO|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Are you saying people don't play bridge outside Budapest?|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told 15-17 - and then N's hand = 1NT|pg||
nt|toral5: but barring this hand.lol|pg||
nt|toral5: south PLEASE dont DUCK @D|pg||
nt|pelu: but here Sapan: I would never overcall 1@D|pg||
nt|toral5: thank u pelu:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: for sure W cant bid 5@s - but I have been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@S looks like a strange bid?|pg||
nt|toral5: hopefully he will play @C properly|pg||
nt|toral5: match getting closer;only 2 imp deficit|pg||
nt|toral5: @D duck will be fatal|pg||
nt|toral5: now 1 imp|pg||
nt|royhughes: I see you guys managed fine without me :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  failing to bid 1nt  W got trouble|pg||
nt|royhughes: West doubled despite the short diamonds, and East just chose to bid his longest suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dont blame him... i wd dbl too|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bagman: Having showed 44 majors and getting no reaction from partner, W could show his 3 card support expecting to be in a decent trump suit|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s will prevail |pg||
nt|runnerup: strange bidding to worse game but mames now|pg||
nt|kirp:  strangely enuff, its cold|pg||
nt|kirp:  now with the lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  play 3 trumps, then finesse in @Cs for @D pitch|pg||
nt|kirp:  good bid by E!!!|pg||
nt|kirp:  S is wondering how to keep down undertrix|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't fault EW -- it's a matter of style|pg||
nt|jfaria:  and passing 2@d?|pg||
nt|royhughes: My preference is to pass the West cards|pg||
nt|royhughes: on the first round, I mean.  He has to pass 2@d|pg||
nt|jfaria:  after E pass ther is a case for passing too|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eamongall: If anybody is following a pair you can find their probable table from the following |pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye may lead a club now and get a plus score ag 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it was the @C position which influenced him more|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much to the play the club ace is right or it isnt:)|pg||
nt|athene: if west invites, east might bid it on the strength of the good club suit, even though he is minimum in terms of hcp|pg||
nt|szalay:  not really, they r from Szeged and few pairs from Pecs|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bagman: S wants to compete but the majors are behind her so she gives up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@C help ,,, opps |pg||
nt|toral5: oh my god|pg||
nt|pelu: at many tables played by N (1Nt and tranfer) - down on @C-lead|pg||
nt|toral5: why this duck?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|szalay:  Hungary is more or less Budapest orientated, bridge is even centralized|pg||
nt|athene: difficult lead problem for south|pg||
nt|glen: should be three aces and a trump|pg||
nt|runnerup: in other table declarer took advantise off that same lead to put @d looser away ,but lost control because 4-1 and K -offside in @h contract|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S works well here on the 3-3 @S breat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rather tame bidding|pg||
nt|glen: break|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As always - trump-lead|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but if any i would bid 1nt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: OK|pg||
nt|roswolf: the clubs can of course be set up here for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H - 4@D - 4@S - 5@D and 51S by Helgemo!|pg||
nt|pelu: 15 INP to Monaco |pg||
nt|MolvaM: no so easy if east ducks|pg||
nt|athene: north could have made life easier, perhaps, by doubling 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: but he finds the heart anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: some play a double of these transfer responses as some sort of takeout double anyway|pg||
nt|athene: for example after nebulous 1@C - 1@H [spades], X = diamonds and hearts, and 1@S = clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|athene: but without special agreements of that sort i would have thought double would just be hearts and 1@S would be takeout, the same as after a transfer over 1nt|pg||
nt|szalay:  Mr. Zsak is teacher of Szeged bridge, he was teacher of Mr. Cseho of other table when he attended Faculty of Medicine there. as u know: he is my psychiatrist:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  unless E thinks playing for a simple @H finesse is better option!|pg||
nt|granguru:  a deceptive move|pg||
nt|glen: now Benito might or might not lead his singleton @D here|pg||
nt|glen: @D lead, A, @D ruff, @H to the Q, and rats, that's ruffed!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: his rule is a bit too rigid to be the absolute truth|pg||
nt|glen: we were out in the beer garden when the TD came by to get us all back in this match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice @C9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|granguru:  but defense is obvious|pg||
nt|rv: frozen @d suit, can't see a way for Zmud to make this |pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - but often opponents find the way...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dummy itÂ´s lay-down|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jbgood: even 6@h a good save over 4@s:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: spade ace and a club takes it 1 down|pg||
nt|davpro: Defense better take their tricks at once...|pg||
nt|danilo1: 140 I believe|pg||
nt|royhughes: I am not convinced anyone has the absolute right answer to these problems|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: north really bid his hand to the limit:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27 teams from group-A will qualify for the knockouts. and 5 teams from group-B|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might try ducking in dummy and dropping the @H10 to induce north to lay down the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: but that would only work if south would lead the @H9 from @H9xx|pg||
nt|szalay:  as u know: we, Hungarians try to avoid D lead vs NT|pg||
nt|athene: D = doubleton or diamond?|pg||
nt|szalay:  diamond|pg||
nt|rv: Anklesaria can duck this, win @HK and play @SA and @ST to prevent any mess-up on normal line of play|pg||
nt|jfaria:  of c|pg||
pc|hT|nt|MolvaM: 15 how? 5s cant be made I think|pg||
nt|jfaria:  peacefull partscore|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You see...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eamongall: We are covering tables 8-15 as shown  on the results web page ... so the bottom 8 lines are tables H G F E A B C D in that order |pg||
nt|jbgood: @s 6 for a club now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: Boye should be able to read that|pg||
nt|roswolf: and probably on this layout so can 6@D|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't untangle his black suits here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You look around the table - and you take your decision|pg||
nt|rv: terrible start by Key-Texas here, each bad result and being on Vu-graph is adding up|pg||
pc|d4|nt|szalay:  Diamonds for girls, u know|pg||
nt|granguru:  S is trying that EW moves @S |pg||
nt|toral5: shocking play.it at all he played for @C ace with jassem,still @D ace is safe\|pg||
nt|toral5: deservingly gone down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eamongall: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/fa.html|pg||
pc|d5|nt|davpro: E could hold 764 from W view|pg||
nt|pelu: S dont know that he has a "sure! @C-trick and exp @CA or Q by East (overcall)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|runnerup: some creek gift so to say|pg||
nt|glen: did declarer really skate to dummy to play another @H?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  W was between 2 fears 1 get caught bidding 1nt  2 hearing 2 @d from p|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1@s was an alternative, too|pg||
nt|royhughes: I prefer that to 1NT|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he choosed the later|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kirp:  8 trix|pg||
nt|granguru:  1 TRICK...SUCCESS|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good point Roy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eamongall: this is table 13 of 15 in play tables and 3rd line from bottom of scoresheet |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jbgood: but difficult to think that prd has 5 spades (and a @c void...)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: if he unblocks the @SAK he can't get to his clubs|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm just chicken|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: sorry 5@S down 1 - so only 7 IMP|pg||
nt|szalay:  time for hoping up|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can all see @DK, heart gets the job done|pg||
nt|athene: but not so easy for south|pg||
nt|szalay:  I dont see any layout when small is the correct card|pg||
nt|athene: his partner might have singleton @DQ for example|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed not|pg||
nt|szalay:  he knows pd's cards|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bagman: Now E can ruff the diamond and try the heart to the K|pg||
nt|eamongall: Most pairs move to the table of the pair below them next ... ie 12 goes where 11 used to be |pg||
nt|rv: I presume Zmud guessed right since if DA is with Kezad, @hk is likely to be with Venkatesh|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: no - then the 7 for his known strenth|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|glen: interesting line, requires N to have two or less @Hs, and @D ace|pg||
nt|glen: if will cash @S ace here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but what does it gain against|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: well THE RESULT IN THE OTHER ROOM SPEAKS FOT ITSELF|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: amazingly 5s was made. cant see how|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the 2NT bid denied four diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jfaria:  so with waht hand would u bid 1nt?|pg||
nt|royhughes: From West's point of view, 2@d didn't have to be a bad contract -- partner might have had longer diamonds|pg||
nt|royhughes: I like my vul 1NT overcalls to be 16-19, stronger than most people play, especially when partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: Also AK8 of hearts isn't as nice as something like KJx|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well said Roy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: nobody would give style points for this defense|pg||
nt|royhughes: There is the risk of getting shut out of the bidding, of course|pg||
nt|royhughes: Nothing's perfect!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but ur comments on this deal seem near perfect :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I am a simple mind, bid 1nt when i can specially if i can find another way to tell my story|pg||
nt|royhughes: hard to quarrel with that|pg||
pc|hK|nt|szalay:  and dummy play is a hint as well|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bagman: The heart attempt is likely to fail as N has shown @DA and @CK already|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|szalay:  nice defence, anyway|pg||
pc|cK|nt|glen: it gains against boredom|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: but there was nothing better to try|pg||
nt|athene: if so, that is another example of how much easier you make life for the defence when you tell them exactly what declarer has|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
nt|glen: now bonus trump trick possible|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the risk of under bidding is real, u can loose a vuln game also|pg||
pc|h4|nt|davpro: From declarer view E has got 2+@c, so @c to T is the only thing that might work|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bagman: NS currently the 7th; EW about that much from the bottom|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: J @H A K and @C would discard a @D over the good @C in the dummy|pg||
nt|davpro: what do I know...|pg||

nt|jbgood: playing for the singleton jack with E:) |pg||

nt|jbgood: not the precentage play:)|pg||
nt|davpro: no- @c 2-2|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: sleeping too:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes angelini not getting their own way|pg||
nt|kirp:  so its 25-20 actually|pg||
nt|runnerup: feeling bid perhaps|pg||
nt|kirp:  25-22 sorry|pg||
nt|kirp:  this looks like easy 3N NS|pg||
nt|glen: and there you have it, never a dull moment|pg||
nt|glen: clever 1NT bid in the other room|pg||
nt|rv: Anklesaria has already shown @SA and can't have both @DA and @HK for passed hand|pg||
nt|rv: well played Zmud|pg||
nt|rv: Z-men are getting everything right here, expected from world class players|pg||
nt|royhughes: Different approaches -- that's what makes bridge so great|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bridge_one: 5@H 2 down|pg||
nt|granguru:  Nunes went 1 off i  4@H here|pg||
nt|kirp:  NS may get to game in @Hs, not a succcess|pg||
nt|kirp:  2 opening bids, hard to sotp|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: hmm mysterious|pg||
nt|pelu: @H AK |pg||
nt|MolvaM: ahh defence played @hAK|pg||
nt|szalay:  funny, that I read interviews about Fantunes-Angelini affair this morning|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now a choice between to major games|pg||
nt|glen: but W is not selling out cheaply here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south is forced into a view at this turn|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still the odds are west is about to raise spades, so bidding 3@H is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but above all good partnership is the more important|pg||
mb|d|nt|jfaria:  sure not|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@H a transfer|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@D is unbalanced hand, so I guess N does not want to go 4 penalties|pg||
nt|glen: modern bridge: 3 value showing bids, and you have 14 high card points|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|pelu: its so easy when u see all 52 cards - try to take place behind the player and only see 26 cards|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: trouble here|pg||
nt|royhughes: West's 2@d shows a major|pg||
nt|royhughes: this is a common treatment today|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: not a good result for hungary in the other room|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok this if any must be 3nt all around ,but I have learned not to say it aloud,because something not so normal seems to happen somewhere in all boards |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Suicide opening|pg||
nt|toral5: where do you expect @C ace to be?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@S correct bid !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well that was a bit of a careless defence I thk|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the spade overcall|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well the alternative is also not attractive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@d says nothing about @h i presume, just shows fit/short|pg||
nt|glen: N's pass would be forcing for most, after the 4@D shortness bid|pg||
nt|glen: now S has to decide if his hand is gold, or straw|pg||
nt|glen: W cuebids and now that lets N show @H support|pg||
nt|glen: if W had bid 4@S, N would have a choice of bidding or passing|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: 5@s made on the unfortunate lead of the @c ace next door|pg||
nt|jbgood: doubled to boot|pg||
nt|rv: Zmud normally will pass with any semi-bal hand|pg||
nt|toral5: why would i talk after seeing 52 cards?|pg||
nt|toral5: you precisely play east for q10 @C.than @D duck is correct|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1Nt - 3Nt I hate to lead minor - often we have better attack in major|pg||
nt|jfaria:  since S cant X maybe N can|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: transfer to spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H|pg||
nt|szalay:  I doubt anyone could miss a game here|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@S denies 4 @Ss|pg||
nt|rv: normal contract for E-W is 3n which has no play on @s lead ducked|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems to be 500 for charity|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: north has not found hearts obfiously -so svedish increasing lead perhaps|pg||
nt|jfaria:  depending on agreement|pg||
nt|danilo1: Gold may see @C shortness ... and bid 5@S ... however, not easy choice ...|pg||
nt|kirp:  my explanations are all hypothetical here, have no idea what Poles are actually playing|pg||
nt|glen: wow, S lets 4@S by with a 6-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: E doesn't want to lead from her collection|pg||
nt|bagman: Every card might be right or wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: but lavazza may suffer in the end|pg||
nt|szalay:  and I wd like to be in 4S, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: most bid more than 1@S with four-card support but i am sure they will unravel it all|pg||
nt|roswolf: OH I COULD VERY EASILY:) |pg||
nt|szalay:  this game about vulnerable bonuses, more or less|pg||
nt|roswolf: might not be good play but.....|pg||
nt|danilo1: correct action - hand looks like double fits|pg||
nt|kirp:  I guess 2@Cs EW can be held to 4 trix|pg||
nt|jbgood: nunes might have won it - but forgot to pull trumps, and opps got a @d ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends how you interpret the double, does it invite a sac, i think so|pg||
nt|toral5: missed the lead here|pg||
nt|pelu: so my "normal" lead would be a @S from East - here killing :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  that's it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: well a simple 4@S on this one|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but congrats geoffrey for yr prediction powers|pg||
nt|jfaria:  that is a nice discussion about ownership of the hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  x from S would be TO so N cooperates|pg||
pc|d2|nt|szalay:  bridge wd be a very boring game if we could bid seen by both hands|pg||
pc|d3|nt|toral5: and that surely is WITHOUT seeing 52 cards:)|pg||
nt|pelu: my analyse is: 1: I dont like to lead minor, 2: @S or @H, 3: @HA entry,so: @S|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u sensed that defence coming and predicted 5s making  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is cheeky|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wasnt a very scientific sequence|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but effective apparently|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like he will establish the 5th heart|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes methinks he is very lucky|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is the legitimate downer lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  problem is what to do with @D if you take 3 round of trumps|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: easy game here - time to go for coffee :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but go fast :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: here is the running scores and current ranking http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|kirp:  ruff a spade and 3 rounds of trumps and hope something good happens |pg||
pc|c3|nt|royhughes: NS made 3NT +1 in the other room|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kirp:  oops|pg||
nt|glen: 2@Cs and a @D only, and this makes|pg||
nt|lechcold: ducking @D in  20 was not bad...it loses only if East has 1-2 small clubs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||
nt|roswolf: you need to qualify for SWISS A then:)|pg||
nt|rv: if Texas had opened 3@s, Balicki might have bid 3n or doubled (close decision) and if he had doubled Zmud might have bid 4@c which is last making contract for E-W|pg||
pc|c4|nt|szalay:  I predict 3 imps for Angelini|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|danilo1: Bd 14 - peacefull 4@S in OR too ... so no swing|pg||
nt|glen: versace not cooperating|pg||
nt|glen: he will only win third @S play|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|MolvaM: goes for the crossruff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  Trump-lead, North then ducked the @D...|pg||
nt|lechcold: if U win the first trick, then U still have a @C guess ( 20)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kirp:  not sure why that @S play|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: i oncerad a statistic -if after a normal opening bid you bid game whenever you are vul you gain on average 8+ imps unless your opps double 66% of the time!: i doubted those stats ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: at the time but i am getting more convinced the more i play/watch the game|pg||
nt|roswolf: once read|pg||
nt|granguru:  for that you must end in summy and play @D to the Q ..if E takes you repeat the process|pg||
nt|jbgood: no need - Boye never got his @d ruff - I really wonder why|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: ohh|pg||
nt|szalay:  if u watch (and especially play) more, u know more:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  declarer may only take 9 trix here.|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems to have +1 in any case anyway |pg||
nt|kirp:  he does but does not know @Ds dont run|pg||
nt|kirp:  may not take @C finesse as not necessary!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|danilo1: danger is too loose trump control ... or to loose @C trick ... probably -1 as will try 3 @H in West|pg||
nt|kirp:  its easy here but ruffing the spade before last trump puts you in dummy for a @D lead|pg||
nt|pelu: agree Leck, the duck is with odds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: what would panel bid on 3@s opening with East hand? X or 3n?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  3 NT - always|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|granguru:  12 imps for Mirage|pg||
nt|kirp:  a true mirage|pg||
nt|granguru:  now up 22-18|pg||
nt|kirp:  for E|pg||
nt|royhughes: I am very wary of making predictions -- but maybe just 4 trump tricks to EW for -1100?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jbgood: X-files was nothing compared to this - you really dont believe it - even if you see it:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: lost his way|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.but we are allowed to guess correctly|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not the best line- if you overcall on that garbage you need to play it well|pg||
nt|kirp:  ok making 4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: on a club lead north could rise ace and play another :) now declarer might finesse as his only chance to make|pg||
nt|athene: thinking north might have @CAQx and be trying to scare him out of a winning play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sunsamvar: nice def|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, it's good to cash all the winners to avoid trump endplay|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: useful swing to Vito to stretch lead to 13 imps|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't think declarer can do better than 4 down -- could do worse by playing A, 10|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or to 16 imps ... depending on how he plays @Hs|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bagman: Declarer was sure about 7 tricks and had a shot for 9 (diamonds 3-3); he did not want to try anything in hearts because he might have lost 4 spade tricks|pg||
nt|athene: that would be the two down|pg||
nt|szalay:  re|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|athene: welcome back :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 7-1 @D was unlikely IMO|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s8|pc|h2|pg||

nt|athene: so just one down and 3 imps as predicted|pg||

nt|royhughes: by ok, I mean taking all his tricks|pg||
nt|royhughes: Well done by NS|pg||
mb|1C|nt|MolvaM: yes. but could be more difficult to stay in the top 27 there|pg||

nt|roswolf: our lips are sealed:)|pg||

mb|2D|nt|runnerup: nothing should happen here but ..|pg||

nt|szalay:  wd be anyone pass with East hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hate the overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: iasy to fins the @s in OR - here E had the chance to bid @S on low levcel :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: The South hand would be considered a bit too good for a single raise by many|pg||
nt|royhughes: But it is a matter of style|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Barbara Apel|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi all, Barbara from Las vegas|pg||
nt|runnerup: loosing 3nt or 4h no game onsome chanche in |pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D artificial GF|pg||
mb|d|nt|szalay:  may be I am alone, but dont feel any positive to overcall with hand, especially with passed pd|pg||
nt|runnerup: getting ew sacrifise for nothing|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not sure I understand this action by E|pg||
nt|kirp:  S should balance but this tuff|pg||
nt|rv: is this Wilcosz?|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@S = 10+, 5+@H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but downgraded due to 4333 pattern and the points in @C sitting under opener|pg||
nt|royhughes: East refuses to sell out cheaply|pg||
mb|3D|nt|eamongall: a decent score for NS for 1NT up 2 on board 7 |pg||
nt|bagman: The spade lead was unlucky for NS|pg||
nt|athene: south might try 3@D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: well there is a generous lead from McGann he won;t be happy |pg||
nt|hawe45:  A fast - flat - board|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, agree with comments about downgrading|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i bet 10 tricks here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D game force (xyz)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would overcall for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: after 3@D i think north has an automatic 3nt|pg||
nt|runnerup: very speculiar bidding -really like this..|pg||
nt|glen: in the other room the 1@S opening found the major fit without problem|pg||
nt|toral5: any one for 6@D here?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|szalay:  I think 1N is a tipical underbid by underdogs vs, world classes|pg||
nt|szalay:  at least 2N is sufficient|pg||
nt|athene: well, the problem is you know you don't want to play in 2nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has seen his pard's overcalls before|pg||
nt|jfaria: my Mac connection fade away, back in a micro pc|pg||
pc|cA|nt|danilo1: misfit hand ... so 3NT |pg||
nt|jfaria:  3nt, what eles?|pg||
nt|granguru:  SS should be -1|pg||
nt|pelu: Polish @C in action, nice to have Lech here to explain |pg||
nt|toral5: or 6h as the cards lie|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: you want to play in 1nt or 3nt or a diamond partscore|pg||
nt|jfaria:  on the other hand 5@h had a chance|pg||
nt|danilo1: good conclusion by West that declarer has probably only 4-card @S (otherwise could bid 3@D) ... |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|barbyh: could have heldthem to 1 less|pg||
nt|bagman: There is a theory, which states that against blind 3NT one should lead from the worse 4-carder from a 4432|pg||
nt|barbyh: against matchpoints or imps?|pg||
nt|bagman: both|pg||
nt|bagman: I don't subscribe to that theory but I was told that it was backed up by a huge simulation|pg||
nt|eamongall: The good news for McGann on the last board is some 3NT+2 company is appearing ...|pg||
nt|bagman: who knows; at least it makes leading easy|pg||
nt|barbyh: true, |pg||
nt|barbyh: well in this case lead from a club and you holdthemto 4|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond lead (suggested by the theory) holds the contract to 4, too|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after tomorrow evening the knockouts will start with 32 teams|pg||
nt|runnerup: can he escapepe for 1 down?|pg||
nt|kirp:  even on a good day i see 2 down|pg||
nt|kirp:  and given his bidding, i would gues 3 or more down|pg||
nt|granguru:  even -2|pg||
nt|kirp:  so a small pick up for EW, but not gteed|pg||
nt|rv: 2@h is @h +any other (incl @s), Polish weak 2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kirp:  we have seen down 3 morph  into down 1|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@S shortness I believe|pg||
pc|sK|nt|glen: this @S lead reduces communication to S hand to nothing|pg||
nt|lechcold: they will be in 6@H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|granguru:  3 or 4 imps....|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jfaria:  played by N :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: some chance to increase spades |pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: 6 in red: u have to find 1 out of 2 key-cards (@HK - @DQ) fine odds for that|pg||
nt|toral5: they are on track|pg||
pc|d3|nt|danilo1: ... unfortunately for him ...9 and 7 behind 1086|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Forrester may not see 9 tricks, but L/V have more dificulties in finding 5..|pg||
nt|danilo1: since @DK good, and @C10 coming will probably make ... sooner or later, opps must give him a trick|pg||
nt|kirp:  s thinks he can N a @S ruff, but makes no sense given the 5@C bid !|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: Israel in OR: stop in 4@h|pg||
nt|lechcold: Martens probably will make a move because of 55 distribution|pg||
nt|toral5: i think martens ll make 1 more bid with his reds shape|pg||
nt|toral5: nice scientific bidding by ew here.|pg||
nt|toral5: deserve to reach a slam:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D was 18+, so Jassem has no extras|pg||
nt|pelu: the red 10's are importen cards|pg||
nt|lechcold: on the other hand, x, AJxxx, Kxxx, Qxx gives reasonable slam|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|szalay:  2D is an option as well, but u have stopper and kinda D suit, when u dont need length help|pg||
nt|granguru:  a red suit now|pg||
nt|rv: Anklesaria 3n is lebensohl response showing game values w/o 4@s and stopper in @h|pg||
pc|d9|nt|granguru:  not easy|pg||
nt|kirp:  W cant lead a @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|davpro: the @d losers vanished|pg||
nt|jbgood: not easy to find the @d lead|pg||
nt|davpro: nope|pg||
nt|toral5: now a question of an extra trick depending upon locating @D q|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Macs and ipads are not compatible with BBO :(|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: south just has a harder problem over 1@S than if east passed|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I mean Gold thx|pg||
nt|kirp:  a @h now and its 3 or more down|pg||
nt|kirp:  good switch|pg||
nt|granguru:  excelent defense by brogeland|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|glen: will W exit with a @C?|pg||
nt|jbgood: he has to be on his toes:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: maybe Jassem has extras, though:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|glen: (no)|pg||
nt|granguru:  angelini's turn to open @H|pg||
nt|granguru:   second exelent move|pg||
nt|jbgood: but the 8?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|roswolf: another poor contract but more reasonable to bid|pg||
nt|athene: that's one reason for overcalling|pg||
nt|szalay:  if he has sthg extras, lets play 3N. 2D and 3D isnt bad, but very likely he will decline without AofD|pg||
pc|d4|nt|danilo1: exiting with @C would not help ... since declarer may play @HA and @HQ .. therefore Alfredo (hoping in @HK at pd) tried to search 2 @S tricks |pg||
pc|d6|nt|danilo1: not taking 10 looks like error |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|runnerup: he has them now|pg||
nt|kirp:  too cute|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|rv: much needed IMPs for Texans, all their supporters and neutrals:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|3D|mb|d|nt|brolucius: 3@D sound raise in hearts. The double suggests a diamond lead.|pg||

nt|kirp:  lots of potential here, but actually a part score|pg||
nt|kirp:  this match has seen too many weak NTs|pg||

nt|szalay:  but it rather looks hungarian death:(|pg||
nt|jbgood: it is not only the NTs that have been weak:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: on the other hand, with bad 18 (if 18 can be bad) Jassem would have bid 4@H after 3@D|pg||
nt|toral5: a jordan 2nt or a fit showing 3d?or just 4h?|pg||

nt|jfaria:  I was trying to help Supermax when I went down :(|pg||
mb|2D|nt|glen: modern bidding: three value showing bids to you, and you have 10 high card points|pg||
nt|runnerup: north didnt want open 4 @h because he was too good,but he has his 7 tricks and that is it |pg||
nt|kirp:  N has too many @Ds, knows S also has them or a bad hand|pg||
nt|glen: as martin just said|pg||
nt|rv: Zimmerman was argubaly the weak link in the team and Texans haven't been able to capitalize on this|pg||
mb|4H|nt|MolvaM: 2nt is?|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  how many @h will L/V play?|pg||
nt|glen: established partnerships often use transfers over the negative double|pg||

nt|kirp:  lovely fit here, good system when pard has to play the hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|szalay:  good lead:)|pg||
nt|athene: this match does illustrate the "game every hand" philosophy - most deals at least one pair is in game, and when one side bid game and the other didn't, the aggressive action ...|pg||
nt|athene: usually gained|pg||
nt|roswolf: @CQ followed by a diamond switch is possible|pg||

pc|h6|nt|bridge_one: 4@D great choice by Versace|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|roswolf: really!?|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw its the correct line if @Cs are 5-3|pg||
nt|athene: he has 8 tricks so he wants north to cash out his clubs - hoping he just loses four tricks and then has a spade-diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade finesse is more or less marked|pg||
nt|rv: with no entry in his hand, suspected he will not continue @hs and then it is matter of which suit to switch|pg||
nt|rv: rare error by Balicki, you might not see another one till the end of this match:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: i guess they play 2@c as game force - but not sure. if so, E may have regretted his pass, 3 nt always on|pg||

nt|royhughes: We are paid to express opinions!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: EW can make here 10 tricks in NT on a club lead 11 tricks otherwise|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 more matches will be played tomorrow and then 27 teams from group A, and 5 teams from group B will proceed to the knockouts|pg||
nt|athene: Fantunes are sort of forced to play weak notrump as a consequence of the rest of their system|pg||
nt|kirp:  both these teams look to qualify i think|pg||
nt|glen: or is it still 4am eastern?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he sure expressed himself :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: if they reach 4@S now north will have all the info he needs to axe|pg||
nt|kirp:  this does look like 10 trix|pg||
nt|rv: arguably Monaco Z, Lavazza, Mahaffey and Angelini were the pre-tourney favorites, Angelini are already out since they finished 30th in Swiss A|pg||
pc|s3|nt|davpro: What have I missed in the bidding?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tomorrow we start at 10.00 hrs CET|pg||
nt|roswolf: these 2 teams will surely be in contention|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4am eastern yes :)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@H is not much of a preemptive raise with 5 trumps|pg||
nt|rv: they are still many excellent Polish teams, Israel, Netherlands who could easily beat any of the favorites|pg||
nt|rv: both East and West have stretched here|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW did well here -- picked off NS's best suit and then stopped in a good 2@c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|szalay:  this partnership has this "talent"|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has heard the warning bell|pg||
nt|athene: east simply discounted his @CQ on the bidding, so he is left with a nine-count|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that was fine judgment|pg||
nt|szalay:  as I watched many times: they r frequently agressive when pd has good hand, and passive when has bad one...we call it: "magican"|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

nt|rv: incidentally Dutch are defending champions in this event|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: only 8 trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good lead|pg||
nt|glen: now N has room to jump support @Ss|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bagman: E bid 3NT to show the spade stopper in case W was interested in that; If W had a huge @H raise, he would not pass 3NT|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed a M?|pg||
nt|davpro: 2@d balanced hand , 3@c a major, 4@d ask major  (according to a kib)|pg||
nt|jbgood: probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little optimistic but a fair shot|pg||
nt|glen: 3@S asks are you italian, 4@S=yes|pg||
nt|kirp:  4th best lead, nothing better to sooth the soul|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ace - and !Queen = ruff|pg||
nt|rv: East could have passed instead of 1@S opening and Zmud could have raised to 2@s with flat 4333 shape|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 3 means, that the @D King is in North|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|glen: this allows non-italians to play the partscore|pg||
nt|granguru:  with this trick Angelini made his contract|pg||
nt|glen: this should coast home nicely, with no nasty splits about|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|jbgood: but still down|pg||

nt|granguru:  If n plays @C is it a tie|pg||
nt|granguru:  @h3 suit pref signal for @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: he has 2 black suits - a 50 % ? either this or that...:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this will close the gap|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kirp:  know pard has cards in @Hs, cant have enuff in @Ss to run the suit|pg||

nt|lechcold: if spade is played from the table, East must put @S10|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: for results http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: the idea is you just want to make sure of two heart tricks and if the finesses loses you might not even get two|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw first 27 from swiss A, first 5 from swiss B go to KO|pg||
nt|athene: but losing finesse doesn't matter here anyway with the nice breaks in the red suits|pg||
nt|szalay:  and first 8 has the right to choose opps from 9-32|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes which was why it was a fair shot|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s8|nt|davpro: I need some sleep. Thx all kibs for pointing out my stupidity|pg||
nt|dburn: I doubt he cares all that much about the four, given what happened to the ace|pg||
nt|szalay:  the ranking order 9-32 is decided by NOT the result, but WBF/EBL masterpoints|pg||
nt|jfaria:  kind of 2 out of 3 ok, not a bad game vuln|pg||
nt|pelu: Russia has made a great comeback against Denmark - down 51-19 at halftime, but after 24 boards up 65-61 :(:(:(:(|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2S!|nt|royhughes: 6@h is ok too but maybe a bit more problematic if the hearts are 4-1|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|barbyh: well bid auction|pg||
nt|pelu: NL-red 49-1 but now only 63-42 against Lovicz|pg||
nt|jfaria:  W got 2 aces but poor @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: waited for his second suit then bid spades|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bagman: W had enough to balance but not enough to invite further|pg||
nt|rv: 2n is forcing here, I presume they would invite with 1n-2@c-2x-2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|royhughes: true.  heart 9 and club jack are useful plus values|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he shows the aces and let p take control|pg||
nt|royhughes: both quite valuable opposite partner's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Are NS leading 3rd/low or is this an alarm clock lead?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  9th trick - might have problems is West ducks twice with the @D Ace|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Venkatesh's sequence here shows 5@s+4@d, mild slam try, he was stretching here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but E doesnt want to take control either|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hands fit well but tough to find out the @Cj, @H9 for East and the solid @C suit for West|pg||
nt|royhughes: Sementa-Duboin made it tough in the other room with a spade barrage|pg||
nt|jfaria:  either side must take a share of optimism|pg||
nt|jfaria:  easy if E bid 4@c instead of 2@s|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a slight overbid though|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think West can go on -- his partner has tried for slam opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but 4@C tends to show not so good a hand |pg||
nt|jfaria:  slam try with very good @c , no?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes but the east hand is too good in my book for 4@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: Was the 4@h bid after noticeable thought?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I was busy typing, as usual|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dont think there was a pause|pg||
nt|royhughes: That's good -- you want to be in tempo when you sign off in game|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|royhughes: There may be uncertainty about what suit is trumps -- 2@s maybe didn't promise 4 hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: So 5@c may be not forcing|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think 5@c is kind of last train|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if 3@S showed @Sa and 4@D the @Da is there room for points in @H wonders Baldu.. ?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  W bid all the goodies on earth :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  not his fault if they stop bellow 6 level|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now B wonders about @h quality from p|pg||
mb|6H|nt|rv: declarer may set-up 9th trick by setting another @c trick and only 1@d trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: whats an alarm clock lead?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most poles play 2/4 leads, as far as I know|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: well done... fortune favours the brave and the brave drink Lavazza|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|pelu: 111 tricks even with @Ss 5-0 - no ruffs in East|pg||

mb|p|mb|6N|nt|sunsamvar: anyone for bidding 2@C with the East hand insted of 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: tough lead for N|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|rv: Balicki's 4@c shows auto splinter with good 6+@s|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like Israel are pulling away|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3N works...it's probably end of Ericas hopes:(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H would too; both depending on a favourable heart position|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|barbyh: 4 h, or 4 sp all roads lead to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense needs to cash the @CA after the diamond lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barbyh: or 12 if the dont cash|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c8|nt|bagman: Declarer might win this in dummy and lead a diamond|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lucky for West.. wd have been a guess on th @H lead|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|rv: Texans need a big swing in the next couple of boards to reduce the deficit and believe they have a chance, also carry a bit of momentum into second segment|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jfaria:  was just saying that a kib sugested 6@d would be in danger after a @c lead|pg||

nt|lechcold: 10 tricks in Spades available here|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|barbyh: why?  nothing to lose by playing a diamond|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that E put S to a tough spot and it was reasonable for S to play a trump; I'm not sure it it was the best single dummy but surely it was a possible play|pg||
nt|bagman: In guessing situations, people guess wrong|pg||
nt|bagman: at least sometimes|pg||

nt|blum1956: Why did East not ruff a club?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|3C|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the first half of this match. The time has come to thank our wonder VG operator (clap! clap!) An excellent session for him and we all appreciate it.|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: Many thanks, too, to my fellow commentator, Michael.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3N|nt|blum1956: Thanks to the spectators and to you, David|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C = majors and 3@D shows equal length, asking the overcaller to choose.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Sementa bids hearts, for some reason but will doubtless go back to spades.|pg||
nt|blum1956: Why did he make such a choice then?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: It would make sense if partner might have been on lead against some minor-suit contract, but that was barely possible.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East seems to have unannounced club support and must be considering 5@C.|pg||
nt|blum1956: Against the diamond contract South should better lead a club while against the club contract North will lead himself|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D may have shown some (equal) interest in the majors, while a pass would show disinterest.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But South's hand is very weak.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: Difficult decision for Rusev. 5@c is makeable on this lie of cards but he is not sure|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: 5@C seemed sensible. His partner was unlikely to be able to judge the situation accurately when East had unannounced 4-card club support.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|blum1956: the problem is to duck the lead (and suffer a ruff probably) or to take and concede two diamonds and a heart|pg||
nt|brolucius: An Italian kibitzer tells me that 4@H showed longer hearts, to be played by South. But South had no tenaces to protect and therefore did not bid 4@S.|pg||

nt|rv: have played|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: NS could have successfully competed to 3@H but they took the kiss of dementor, 200, instead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|s2|nt|bagman: S hand is typical where one bids 3NT and waits for the dummy to appear|pg||
nt|barbyh: northcould have save the day by bidding 4 sp|pg||
nt|barbyh: thats if he felt lucky|pg||
nt|eamongall: At another table McGann Brown left opps in 5@Ds ...not best matchpoint effort by NS board 14 |pg||
nt|barbyh: odds are pd has a good minor|pg||
nt|bagman: Some NS have reached 4@H making; S has probably doubled and N felt that nobody plays minors in pairs|pg||
nt|bagman: and why play 6@D when 6N is an as easy make |pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: with 3 trumps, Balicki didn't want to take any chance especially in the context of good set they have had at this table|pg||
