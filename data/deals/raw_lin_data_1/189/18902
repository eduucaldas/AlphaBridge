nt|vugraphpl1: Hi|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|mcsd: Hello all|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Big match, Mahaffey currently 1st in Group E at 91 VPs, and Helle close behind in 2nd at 86|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl1: problem with hands|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Okay we'll wait|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|oosmanb: We're off with a fun hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: This 3@C might imply fit?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: maybe not fit, as Bryant wouldve bid 4@S not dbl|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Mile|pg||
nt|mcsd: doubleing Pepsi in 4@H is not a good idea|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Mike*|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Dbling Pepsi in ANYTHING is not a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  4@h seems resonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Get those @D ruffs going fast!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: yes unless we NS get those ruffs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and even then would probably lose imps to vul 4@S |pg||
nt|mcsd: a@d would be a great lead, or switch|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jfaria:  playing in nt will meet an unfavorable @h break |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|jfaria:  2@c must be some kinf|pg||
nt|jfaria:  kind of good hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oosmanb: oh dear|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now lets se the lead...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Play in @H all that matters now|pg||
nt|mamos: NS are pair based in England Rob Helle Dutch  lives and works a lot of the time now in Poland  -- a great funloving guy with wit and charm  |pg||
pc|hA|nt|oosmanb: Oh wow I was wrong. 4@H +1 in other room!!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|jfaria:  yestarday a leaing british master was telling that unsoported leading honours are underrated|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|jfaria:  he defended a honour lead from this holdong|pg||
nt|jfaria:  based on computer simulation|pg||
nt|jfaria:  looks like he was right this time|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Moment of truth|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Will go up I think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but Dbl ..|pg||
nt|mcsd: may be tat dbl is good idea after all :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I really dont know what the right play is, so I'll back whatever Pepsi decides|pg||
nt|mcsd: now lets anylise, S is known to hold 5+@S 2+@C probably more|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Seems like North has 7@C 3@S but 1@D 2@H or 2@D 1@H?|pg||
nt|mcsd: hard to imagine that he would double without a@D , dso that goes for 10-11 known cards|pg||
nt|oosmanb: technically could be 6@C 3@S 2-2 3-1 1-3 as well?|pg||
nt|mcsd: so etleast 2@H going up with K is more then 80%|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|oosmanb: Mustafa Tokay and Baldursson playing for team Lavazza|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 4@s wasnt entirely straight forward btw, specially on a @d lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in the other room Rodwell never introduced @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: so Meck didnt bid past 3@S, didnt dbl 4@H, and they didnt set 4@H either|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: This looks like limit bid with 5+@D ?|pg||

mb|3D|nt|oosmanb: The deal numbers are loaded wrong I think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 11-20 that's why|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Decent contract, should be able to handle bad trump break|pg||
nt|vugraphpl1: I must give 2 pass. W is dealer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Sorry folks|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of relays|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm getting a lot of help from kibs, appreciate it. 2@H relay|pg||
nt|mamos: yes :)|pg||
nt|mcsd: when the auction ends declarer lets tarzan screem?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: atleast NT right sided|pg||
nt|oosmanb: now they need to stop in 3|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jfaria:  we lost the more interesting chalenge in 4@s..|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: I'm being helped by Ant Edwards, perhaps 2@S is high shortage, and 3@D 2-3-5-3 exactly|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In diamonds, you can play a low diamond from hand, and then ruff a diamond, but that depends on trumps being 3-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So what I would do is wait to see how Jeff plays it, and then say: |pg||
nt|bjacobs: "that's how I would have played it"|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|Walddk3: At least I would|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: he has been terrorizing defenders for decades|pg||
nt|galadriel: Nice article in the bulletin|pg||
nt|cenglund:  His card handling is awsome|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: I would chose Fantoni. If he doesn't make it i would still live a couple of hours longer :) says a spectator. That's true|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|galadriel: Bulletins can also be accessed from this website http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: This is another touchy contract.  That @H8 is a distracting card|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But first Meck has to find the spade switch|pg||
nt|bjacobs: With the lack of entries to dummy, perhaps one uses @CK to play a heart to the TEN|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he'll play a club i think|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I suppose Rodwell is showing preference to spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|galadriel: Does Rodwell know he wants a @S?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: @S 9 is also a distraction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the 9 or 6 would be clearer signals...  remember meckwell play u/d suit preference|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Notice that East did a good thing with that simple 4@H - didn't reveal the side suit of clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: So the defenders are somewhat in the dark|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But they have defended beautifully and challenged declarer to find a precise series of plays to make this contract|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Lack of entries to the dummy favour the winning line|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you ignore @H8, there are TWO ways to play hearts ... catering to either defender having honour-doubleton|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: You can lead low from hand (if South has honour doubleton), or a heart to the 10 for North|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cenglund:  N is likely to have the doubleton given the bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It does seem right to ignore @H8 at this point, lacking the second easy entry to dummy|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So absolutely world-class card play and defence on this deal|pg||
nt|galadriel: Now, Meck can give him another entry|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|galadriel: But would probably still get it right|pg||
