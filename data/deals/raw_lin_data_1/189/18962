nt|danilo1: with @CK good played ... surprise @S lead may beat .. but guess @H lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi for u to Markku:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: if @S lead .. declarer must leav twice .. than switch to @H |pg||
nt|runnerup: so this can be beaten,but probably makes|pg||

pc|dK|nt|bernix: good morning and welcome everybody to round 3 of semifinal A of the European Open|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|danilo1: really 8?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: also 3Nt in OR|pg||
nt|danilo1: really?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|granguru:  funnily if  opens the hand (1N) there is a good chance to arrive at 6@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  could be worth a couple of imps if it is played by West in the other room|pg||
nt|chmitty: I must say that I never met the pair sitting EW ... not been introduced to Mister West nor Mister East|pg||
nt|ntmon: improved|pg||
nt|dburn: well, South decided to play for 4-4 spades, so the defence won't be tested any more|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi John & Vladimir|pg||
nt|suketbombi: remarakable performance by Keyzad and Venkatesh playing their 5th round without any rest|pg||
nt|pelu: same bidding in OR (1@H here = @s)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|runnerup: no test at all -so 5 @d only game if all awake but this was too easy beaten|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|dburn: if he had ducked a couple of spades, though, that might have been a test|pg||

nt|henryb:  looks like -3 to me for a push the hard way|pg||
nt|peachy: push, actually, I forgot the spade ruff|pg||
nt|suketbombi: also the same result so it is a 27 bds contest from here|pg||
mc|10|nt|suketbombi: Hi peter GM|pg||
nt|sfranchino: @h 3-3 claim 10 tricks can we pass at other hands more interesting?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: on a diamond lead declarer can rise ace, draw trumps then lead the @SQ and east can take the black aces but is then endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: a very useful @D9 in dummy!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||

nt|granguru:  another potential slam here|pg||
nt|granguru:  a better one thou|pg||
nt|pelu: only need to play @s-siut with no loser|pg||
nt|granguru:  still it  needs @s 2-2 or stiff honor in E and a good guess|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi all|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, it would not have been a very difficult test, it's true|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The Aussie bidded best here by NS as well as W pressed at 2@H|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ntmon: straghtforward game on  21 |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sfranchino: 4@h against 5@c ?|pg||
nt|pelu: the @D-lead against 4@H will give S some work in 4@H - need to take @DA - 2@H and play@SQ - noe East endplayed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@H  wud be bid alright|pg||
mb|5C|nt|pelu: Hi all - as every time there are problems before the first match - players has to find the right table and so on|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3NT or 5@c both cold here|pg||
nt|chmitty: not an easy bid for North|pg||
nt|chmitty: Can our operator disclose the names of the players sitting EW ??|pg||
nt|chmitty: oh yes :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: ty|pg||
nt|peachy: He might go for the practical 3NT if this were MPs, not so sure IMPs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5c for ns if they get there|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: not with odds - but better that a "Roland-slam"|pg||
nt|bernix: part score battle again. can NS buy it in 3@h ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all, gutten morgen Bernard|pg||
nt|bernix: hi danilo|pg||
nt|pelu: do u agree in only 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Pleased to see that South has a name, but I think I'll stick with 'South'|pg||
nt|granguru:  exchange black QÂ´s and it would have been a rock iron contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: we begin with a possible slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Rodwell did open the N hand with 1NT???|pg||
nt|chmitty: Difficult for South to imagine he has so many defensive tricks !|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will North x now ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hope for him there was not too much of an hesitation behind the screen|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S might have doubled. Vul versus notvul, N had great expectations of making, the colors tell he was not preempting|pg||
nt|chmitty: I agree 100% Raija|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t understand leads from Hxx|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: Hi John|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 clubs best here 6nt /e also|pg||
nt|sfranchino: 3@h i think is not a bda bid makes problem only for the pard|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR 1@D opening and 4@H passed out|pg||
nt|sfranchino: or 1@h or 4@h|pg||
pc|h7|nt|granguru:  I would have done it if @CK|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think many in the field will bid this one|pg||
nt|chmitty: he must protect the score of his pair|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|granguru:  NICE TO see u again Raija |pg||
nt|granguru:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Convention cards are not available so unfprtunately we cannot explain bidding|pg||
nt|granguru:  at NT or any Moysean|pg||
nt|chmitty: Next door bidding started 2@s (E) 4@s ... NOrth thinking|pg||
nt|danilo1: nice 6@C ... if by mistake in 6@S - or even 6NT (E) ... all will make|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|pelu: and I would open 1@D 100% (=4+@d)|pg||
nt|paulg:  North has distribution and they have a lot of controls|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@C cue X @Cs|pg||
nt|granguru:  N could have xx to show second round ctrl|pg||
nt|pelu: when N open 1Nt then Meckstroth has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|pelu: RD = 1. round control|pg||
nt|granguru:  but then it is more complicate to show @d ctrls|pg||
nt|granguru:  RD is second if 4@C was first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmmm and a 6-3 c fit not too imp;ressive|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c instead of 2nd x would have worked better|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: @H-lead - 2x@s and @C finess|pg||
nt|psyck: same bidding in other room though|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: ok that makes life easyer for dsecl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: although 4-2 foirtunate lie in h|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's standard in Poland overcalls are limited, so strong 1-suited hand should X first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course but no 2nd x for me|pg||
nt|ntmon: but after preemptive raise, problems arise|pg||
nt|psyck: if 1345, i'd have Xed 2nd time too, thought 4@c was clearer this hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru:  If I would be forced to guess  1@C strong 1@S=4 ctrls 2N nat 19-21 3@D @C ctrl no @D ctrl|pg||
nt|bernix: phantom sac|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ntmon: 4 obvious tricks for defence|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulg:  It is much easier for us, but can South have less than this to make a slam try with no heart control?|pg||
nt|danilo1: ideal def. is - first @H for A, than @DK and third @D ... guess not easy for Adam now ... since North cann well be single @D |pg||
nt|bernix: but it doesn't matter if he cashes a 2nd @d before switching to hearts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ntmon: i'm inclined to 4@C too but no strong opinion|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: lots of work in 6NT, not impossible I think, but rather aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  a passive lead is a must here|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm thinking E will lead club, that would be my choice|pg||
nt|granguru:  it seems 3@d was nat as N went on to 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: but I am not in Hurd's class of player so we'll see|pg||
nt|granguru:  most passive is @D|pg||
nt|granguru:  the @D10 is a critical card (not here thou) so W has 4 critical suits|pg||
nt|psyck: sry folks, have to switch to another room, c ya|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dburn: 6NT by East would not be a mistake - that contract is 100%, while the defenders might meanly ruff something against 6@c|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6NT is surely best .. by mistake I meant 6@S :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 2.best contract reached|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ntmon: see u later :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: slan|pg||
nt|sfranchino: barrage at 3@h in second position when pard dont bid makes problems only to him|pg||
pc|sK|nt|granguru:  N S expects that @S dont behave...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: do u know players where cuebid are 1. control - to day 1. or 2.? back in the 50'es in US they only cuebid Aces - and lost to Italy every time :)|pg||
nt|peachy: that would have been my last choice of leads, Jxx nearly never right|pg||
nt|granguru:  I am wrong E leads|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong|pg||
pc|h5|nt|granguru:  E has a clear @d lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: Versace will not escape 800 |pg||
nt|danilo1: difficult (almost impossible for Giorgio to correct to 6NT ... he does not see 7-cards @C in West ... and after @D cue (probably single) - cannot risk|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|danilo1: excellent defense ... now even -2 possible |pg||
nt|bernix: caiti must use his only entry to dummy to finesse in @cs rather than @ss|pg||
nt|danilo1: did not matter for -1, I agree Bernard|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Operator, West is  Caiti|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps there is something in the bidding that we are not privvy to, which induced the spade lead|pg||
nt|peachy: To watch multiple tables, http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php.  Open a new window for each additional table.|pg||
nt|ntmon: Lev carefully watching spots|pg||
nt|pelu: @D3 could have worked better|pg||
pc|sT|nt|granguru:  :) true|pg||
nt|granguru:  second choice was @CJ|pg||
nt|granguru:  immo|pg||
pc|s5|nt|granguru:  MADE|pg||

pc|h2|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|psyck: defense have 1@c, 1@d, & likely 4 trumps|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|athene: the side suits all lie well for declarer so the defence will only get the @CA, @DA and probably four trump tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: the simplest defence is for north to lead ace and queen of clubs and later get a club ruff|pg||

nt|psyck: Yes, in one of the matches, a team tried to get to 2@hxx both tables|pg||
nt|athene: some slight danger now; he can lead the @DJ but south rises the ace and he is short of an entry to finesse against the @DQ|pg||
nt|psyck: *yesterday...|pg||
nt|athene: he can still survive by forcing north to lead diamonds for him in the ending|pg||

nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it is a good idea that the very first control is A (or KQ)|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|granguru:  not vul sorry only 22!|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, by the end of tha match, maybe I learn some French by osmosis :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and me some English|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the usual 4-1 break|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - you'd need a relay method to reach 6NT by East with certainty|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR W in 2@SX|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at least the sa is right|pg||

mb|2D|nt|chmitty: 2@d both majors ?|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4 IMP for Krajewski - 5@D on  1 doubled|pg||
nt|buddyshah: And  play  from dummy  Declarer had play   to keeop it to 500|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chmitty: seems so|pg||
nt|peachy: Long time ago, we used to call those bids Polish two suiters, nowadays there are several variations and names for them|pg||
nt|peachy: Hungarian kib tells it is 5@h-4@s, or 4414 or 4405, 11-15HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  would like to hear your arguments...I am open minded :)|pg||
nt|bernix: this looks like a run-of-the-mill 4@s to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: So Lauria will probably reject the option of double ... which could be effective in front of a @s lenght|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  kibz might enjoy an expert view on the matter|pg||
nt|paulg:  I don't think cue bidding first and second round controls equally makes a huge difference to bidding slams, a lot of it still comes down to judgement|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  i think the italians beat the americans so often because they had practised partnerships and better bidding methods|pg||
nt|granguru:  being an  expensive deparment players try to reduce judgement and increase accuracy|pg||
nt|granguru:  good advice...on all contracts under 6NT|pg||
nt|peachy: There are no convention cards available for us (or anyone) so appreciate kib help in interpreting bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought they play transfers over 1c|pg||
nt|dburn: may not be so easy to stop these in a partscore, after all|pg||
nt|danilo1: if to play 4@S ... West should declare|pg||
nt|dburn: but they managed it - this is a partscore|pg||
nt|runnerup: true you cant guess in teams -solid 6 @c ok -here only 3 spades  makes  |pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe Duboin didn't actually pass|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bernix: 3@c sounds like maximum with 5-card suit doesnt it|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk NS play 1NT 15-17 (or at least did before) ... 1@C is choice I believe (agree, 6 controls, no soft values, hand better for suit contracts)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@S by West may make ... no chance if by East|pg||
nt|suketbombi: funy part both play 2@S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: funny|pg||

nt|paulg:  this hand has another debatable point .. how do you break transfers?|pg||
nt|pelu: too difficult to start a cue bid if only A, a cue is an invitation for slam and often u will miss that - and bidding economy also tell u to start with the lovers cue bid|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since there were so many small boards in the first half, I was hoping that all the spectacular stuff had been saved for the second half. False hopes...|pg||
nt|granguru:  from 6NT on the strategy changes|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1NT will be played on most tables|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 toptricks for defense, but not easy to take them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i dislike showing a weak doubleton and telling them what to lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  at top level players almost always lead the right card|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|granguru:  so it is better to bid accurately|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
nt|dburn: Sementa might only raise to three, but he's more likely to bid four|pg||
nt|dburn: and he did, before I could finish typing that he would|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has found a strong lead.|pg||
nt|dburn: still, with this lead...|pg||
nt|danilo1: Well, now we have 4@S by West :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: now 7 tricks for Tokay|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3@C dont show about @Cs but only maxz and 3 card support|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i approve of breaking the transfer with only 3-card support, when you are so suitable|pg||
nt|granguru:  once hamman erred a gran slam lead...20 years the hand was appearing in the news|pg||
nt|peachy: running scores Round 3 (this round) http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda3.html|pg||
nt|sfranchino: i think east had cards for double 2@s he knows that pard had weak hand with @s and opps has not any save|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru:  And he used Judgement..with 2 aces he led the shortest one..(wrong)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ntmon: i think they play crystallic clear Polish club, book version (2005 edition)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be as JASSEMS polish is transfer inh his book|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well. Helped a bit, but agree u|pg||
nt|runnerup: so vulnerable try -no trial just bid it -if not made -perhaps even anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: ...Duboin still can't make it, I don't think, but if North puts up the ace...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chmitty: Great decision by Lauria : 5@c would be at least 2 off when 4@h is down|pg||
nt|peachy: I did find a fairly recent card for EW http://www.archiviobridge.it/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|MolvaM: running a long suit usually creates problems for the defence|pg||
nt|peachy: NS basic system is Strong Club|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|dburn: he can't put the seven on this, because South might have @c98 doubleton, but he may still be OK|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now a club ruff will beat it.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with best defence. a @c switch now|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  @h9 ?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  looks to ask for @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Failing that, a trump misguess by declarer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in that case possibilities to -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  E isn't willing to ask for a @c switch, not knowing what partner has in @c I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was declarer, after a transfer response to 1@C, at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if there is any possibility to defeat, it must be a @c ruff by E. Declarer can have @sKQJ|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW missed the defense against 4@S - played by S: @H to K, @D to A Now @CK to A, @S to 8 and Q, @CJ to Q - but not @C again|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: now 9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: a @d ruff for -1|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: well played by W - he set up a trap - and N fall in|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and looking happily for the 10th|pg||
nt|danilo1: 6@S is not good contract ... correct pass by Balicki ... |pg||
pc|c7|nt|ntmon: transfers don't fit much into the system, 1@D needs to be negative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and E must see that it´s needed with @ha and knowing that N has @cK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s6|nt|danilo1: makin if he starts with @H first ... not impossible after @C lead |pg||
nt|dburn: he can play hearts now|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|granguru:  looks that there is no way to win...no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  @DK ?|pg||
nt|peachy: There are 15 groups of 8 teams each, the top three (I think) will advance to the Swiss, from where top teams advance to KO etc|pg||
nt|peachy: This isnt quite making, I think|pg||
pc|h8|nt|granguru:  what about small @d ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ntmon: anyway, 4@H good contract, will make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: from each group|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: So the chance is missed.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: Ralf's analysis is good. It does seem that a club switch was indicated.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|danilo1: now not anymore ... now need @H 3-3 ... |pg||
mc|6|nt|granguru:  at 6NT the reason is not to give the 12th trick ...normally declarer coudnt find a suit to play...so usually no long suit..if 12 tricks there, there is nothing to lose...but if just 11 you must be carefull not to give 1 trick on the lead.|pg||
nt|dburn: he's still all right|pg||
pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|psyck: 3@c a transfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|5N!|nt|athene: transfer to diamonds then pick-a-slam|pg||
nt|athene: so west will choose 6@D for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|athene: the @H4 is unlikely to be a singleton but you rise ace anyway|pg||

nt|granguru:  garozzo had another saying..when you have a singleton, lead it...|pg||
nt|granguru:  obviously at suit contracts|pg||
nt|peachy: It is one of his famous "Rules"|pg||
nt|granguru:  in general, it made life easier for the defense...if you didnt lead a singleton..you didnt have it...|pg||
nt|peachy: Another one of Garozzo's: "Must have a very good reason for not leading trump"|pg||
nt|danilo1: he knows that pd must have very good @S + need @HK + more than just A in @D ... if all this, Adam would not bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|danilo1: but if he played @H before cashing second trump ... than meight do|pg||
nt|runnerup: 7 @s  here|pg||
nt|runnerup: bidding test|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Grand slam but will settle for 6 I guess|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ah a slam and a minor one at that|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rcerreto:  openings are getting lighter and lighter, these days|pg||
nt|paulg:  his line did have a lot of play|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  well if @H behave he could have made it..but that would have mean @S were also 1-1 and the line should have been different|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but a good sacrifice too|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: At Last tempo would have been better by @H ruffs. Hard to se for them|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@H? .. guess best bid|pg||
nt|dburn: key is South's diamond holding, but if South can get a diamond bid in before North bids Blackwood|pg||
nt|dburn: then North may be able to find what he needs to know|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not like Splinter with A .. as well as do not like 4@S with this distribution|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite an interesting one|pg||
nt|dburn: so 4@c-4@d-4NT-5@h-6@d (asking for third round control)|pg||
nt|danilo1: besides on 2@H may hear @D support and than key card (for @D!!!) |pg||
nt|dburn: despite that being a splinter with the stiff ace, it seems the best way for North to find out what he needs to find out|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see 4@C?|pg||
nt|dburn: he can't really bid 2@h - he would have the Devil's own job getting back to spades if South were to raise hearts|pg||
nt|danilo1: i would bid 2@H - cannot cost since I can allways corect @H contract to @S|pg||
nt|runnerup: dont see many choises|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: top-players dont like the @d-suit :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@d must be relay for clarification, and 3@c shows no major probably|pg||
nt|chmitty: Will south bid 3NT with 3 small spades ?|pg||
nt|dburn: how is partner to know, after 1@d-1@s-2@h-3@h-3@s that you have four spades and two hearts, rather than five diamonds, four hearts and a spade cue bid?|pg||
nt|runnerup: and here it came|pg||
nt|danilo1: if pd has 3-card @D ... @DQ may bi vital card ... and therefore, I would like to hear @D fit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1@D opening would have exited East  i am sure but 6nt is likely to be bid here|pg||
mb|6N|nt|peachy: 2C prob Precision style, 5-6 clubs with possible 4-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  tough lead|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  nothing appeals, @d looks normal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I know about 3700 people who would bid 2nt with east hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  as I said at the beginning ..probably @S finesse instead of a @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is 2s not forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed you would - but you cannot cope with a simple raise in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Mahaffey won the first match 17-13 against a team from Romania (with Bocchi-Maddala!?), Aspe lost 10-20 to a strong team from England|pg||
nt|granguru:  panski plays 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  leading the longest suit is always an option|pg||
nt|ntmon: very hard to find @D fit because of intervetion and inevitable raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: who is the boss now?|pg||
nt|sfranchino: fast system..|pg||
nt|suketbombi: not a pay off to be in a grand on finesse tho|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: good contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c more precise : no major and only one stopper ... South assumes the stopper is @s :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@H is I guess 3NT try ... Cezary knows how valid is @CQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: We have 4 diferent options by us 4 commentators. WHAT IS THE BEST BID AT E IN THE LONG TERM?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr.N|pg||
nt|suketbombi: lead will make it much quicker|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  Bocchi-Madala are playing for Lavazza in another group, whatever the results page says|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: there is a little misunderstanding after explanation|pg||
nt|ntmon: protective X from W - can be really costly now|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi George|pg||
nt|danilo1: wha not ... than pd has 5-card @S ... so @DQ no more vital ... @HK instead ... again Key-card ... and final contract ... in @S|pg||
nt|runnerup: south took blacwood-so perhaps norht take 7|pg||
nt|danilo1: problem here is that they both need to chk what pd has in @D ... and they did not do it|pg||
nt|dburn: North can presumably show @dK and @sQ now|pg||
nt|runnerup: he should tell his card and all he still needs is Q @d |pg||
nt|dburn: but South can't count 13 tricks after that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s from N? in my opinion too strong and he must be happy that S could bid|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: we have to wait for director decision in board 22|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rcerreto:  David, would you lead small or an honour?|pg||
nt|chmitty: well bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup: that can be good for south to bid 7 i yhink|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: if 1Nt = 12-14 I know as mynu who would pass - 12-14 + 10 = 22-24 and no spec fit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to our second Murat, Anter|pg||

nt|MolvaM: the results page is here http://www.poznan2011.pl/results but since the event just started there is nothing in so far|pg||

nt|danilo1: ... bidding also looks like Lebensohn too - so one or another ... now in 4@H|pg||
nt|danilo1: now South knows ... almost enough :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: A nice safety 1370, while 6@S=1430|pg||
nt|runnerup: and north happy -no guessing after all|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|granguru:  bridge rama at the time|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rcerreto:  Ralf?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Polish Specs confirming Lebensohl|pg||
nt|suketbombi: actualy requirement is the @H finese after testing JTX of @C or JT doubleton so will be just about 55%:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: my feeling is Texans may gain 12 or loose 3 here|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi I am back - PC-crass (blue screen)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they are going to be in @DS  and grand combined is reasonable given the potential in @Cs and @S suit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H finese is the last resort|pg||
nt|buddyshah: They are playing 6@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the little bird told me that|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dA|nt|dburn: I guess I would lead low - some danger of a blockage if partner has @dJx, for example|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: I am in the middle of writing a book that involves computer analysis of opening leads. We have found that leading the top honour is generally right.|pg||
nt|runnerup: claiming 2210|pg||
nt|rodal f: But 60 is a 2IMPer|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: well done Ish - 4@c must have been a pretty serious bid for him to use Blackwood immediately|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Sleeping:) LOL|pg||
pc|d3|nt|granguru:  .|pg||
nt|granguru:  In board 22 the 3@D bid inhibited Hurd to lead the suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  now claiming, for sure|pg||
nt|sfranchino: any way for make 7@d also with finesse @h that works @c 3-3 but any squeeze is possible|pg||
nt|suketbombi: so 3 imps it is|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: More often than the old text-books suggest.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a better play was to win the first trick with @c10 and hided @c9. could perhaps given an extra trick|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ntmon: one undertrick saved|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: an honour, if dummy has a middle @d|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  computer analysis could change several paradigms|pg||
nt|suketbombi: JTX of @Cs or JT doubleton @S QJ  if you dont trace a squeeze after failing that take the @H finese|pg||
nt|buddyshah: In pairs Qualification  :  Kiran -Satya  8th  and   Guptaji -Krv  35th  amongst 323 pairs. |pg||
nt|suketbombi: and the 3rd pair did not play buddy?|pg||
nt|buddyshah: I dont  see it.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt could be reached on this board in the open room|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure they'll fix the team lineups on the results pages quickly, they have been very efficient|pg||
nt|granguru:  as for garozzo's saying ..it must have been under specific circumstsnces...such as a 7-level suit contract, or 2. a cross-ruff hand type|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|chmitty: hummm ... did not see the @d Jack fall on the ace ?|pg||

mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: a 6-card suit @hK and a stiff @d|pg||

nt|danilo1: interested in choice what/how to bid by South (1@C Polish, most often 12-14 BAL) |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Allerton may have misread 3@H but East can correct.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, this is the sort of board we were looking for, after so much drab stuff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he has a pretty good hand, in context|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you agree with the strong rise David?|pg||
nt|peachy: Strong 1C, probable 0-7 or some such 1D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|granguru:  under this premise I agree fully..the same philosophy of the 6NT lead..dont give tricks away to declarer on the initial lead.|pg||
nt|granguru:  when you have points in all side suits normally declarer has a solid trump suit...|pg||
nt|ntmon: worked!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the best with this bidding is that W has shown his @h honour|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe their standard for free bids is higher than yours and mine|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C may be @D transfer, or kind of asking - if so 2@D may just show min.|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Richard Bley|pg||
nt|riccho:  Good Morning everyone :) |pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi Richard|pg||
nt|sfranchino: conservative bid pass over double now 4@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 11 in @h and no ambitious higher so this is over in seconds|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Easr didnt read the X from West as @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: saved by S|pg||
nt|murat: good afternoon all :)|pg||
nt|pelu: wellcome now we hace 2 x Murat :)|pg||
nt|sfranchino: north has no cards for bid 3@s|pg||
nt|sfranchino: he is just bidded u hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: Although we may quibble with the odd bid or two, it seems that the players have judged it very well around the table. |pg||
nt|rcerreto:  anyway, they succeeded in bidding the par|pg||
nt|brolucius: The term 'free bid' was responsible for a lot of awful bidding many decades ago.|pg||
nt|murat: guess one of the most common names of Turkey :)|pg||
nt|sfranchino: why bid same cards 2 times?|pg||
nt|pelu: S just places himself between 2 chairs by passing over the X - 100% blame to S and ok bidding by N|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rcerreto:  in a difficult board|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, indeed|pg||
nt|granguru:  !<s now|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

nt|riccho:  2@c is asking about the @h suit IÂ´m told|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... we are guessing bids ... NS do not (they know :))|pg||
nt|sfranchino: pass is a bid that manypeople dont know|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rcerreto:  free-bid is something very different today|pg||
nt|riccho:  so they are playing the same answers after 1@s in rebid than after 1NT? looks sensible ...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|granguru:  -1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chmitty: will not escape 2off probably|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: A @H  switched seemed routine    but the @C play will work out as well|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: I am told that 4@S failed at one table of the other semi. Do four round of clubs and a ruff with the king, leave declarer with some sort of guess?|pg||
nt|granguru:  @C would have best|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d then was probably a obligatory bid with BAL 12-14 Hands (a spec agrees here...:))|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sfranchino: they dont know that is a bid like others means somethingh|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|daman: must play a @H now|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S could often be on 3 card suit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: agree peter in view of the 1st 2@S bid he should quitely play in 3@S|pg||
nt|sfranchino: 3@s from north has any sense|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: Good play trick 1, lead smelled like singleton (maybe doubleton) so retaining finessing opetion to clubs toward hand|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW can make 3@H, 3@D is succesful|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru:  now @C is amust|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: we dont have contact to the Open room, but Board 3 _ the 3NT with 5 toptricks out - gave 10 IMPs to Lavazza|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s6|pc|h3|nt|peachy: EW are able to produce accurate defense for max tricks their side|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|chmitty: Versace knows that Lauria has a small @c to ruff : if not, he would have cashed the @c Ace :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2 off then is the score|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Hardly because South would not lead a 4th club if his trumps were non-existent.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  think so|pg||
nt|riccho:  1@s in polish club is a 12-14 BAL Hand most of the time, but it may be also a BIG hand with 5+@s (even if I dont know, if 1@c is strongest opening here)|pg||

nt|psyck: indeed, def have to set up @d's instead of @h, else dec gets 3@s, 1@d, 2@c, 1@h|pg||
nt|athene: north has to be slightly careful now|pg||
nt|kista: tough @d shift|pg||
nt|athene: if he concedes a heart trick to set up his long hearts east can set up a club trick for 7|pg||
nt|athene: so he has to go for the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: it's not at all obvious; he has to play his partner for the @D10 and @CA|pg||
nt|kista: declarer may not play @c himself|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he puts his partner with the @CA|pg||
nt|athene: then there are two other important cards south can hold: @HJ, @D10|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he does something cute like @HK then @DQ then the club|pg||
nt|psyck: :)  very cute|pg||
nt|athene: saying ok partner, i have these red suits, and i am not sure which one we want to be attacking|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kista: good switch|pg||
nt|psyck: he heard you|pg||
nt|psyck: now sure -1|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer had @DA10x(x) he would win this trick i guess|pg||
nt|athene: so when (if) it holds, north knows his partner has the ten|pg||
nt|psyck: def will be happy to go only 1 down probably|pg||
nt|athene: maybe|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: i am not convinced actually - with @DA10x you might duck this as declarer as a deceptive measure|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: ok well that's found the ten|pg||
nt|kista: now he can try the @h K just in case p has the J|pg||
nt|athene: north may also be worried that south has only @D10x in which case attacking diamonds would establish declarer's fourth card|pg||
nt|kista: that's a good result for texans in the other room|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|vugraphpl5: A low @H would do the job just as fine as the @C shift.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: many people have the agreement that if you shift to an honour, with an honour in dummy, you lead the lower if you have the "surrounding" honour so for example with the ten in dummy ...|pg||

nt|pelu: N has limites his hand (2@S) and now just bid 3@S - for sure P by S his @cQJx also no value|pg||
mb|1N|nt|MolvaM: that usually means our vugraf operator will soon close this table and reopen it to establish the link to the other table|pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: what shld tokay do? dbl?|pg||
nt|chmitty: unless the ace of trumps fell on the floor :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Operator, 2C should have been down two, maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: surprising, that - their auction seemed well on track until the final bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: agree peter he had won the board by bidding 2@S as his 1st rebid|pg||
nt|sfranchino: agree peter |pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: 4@D made against the 300 here, so a big swing to Badger.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was wondering if South would overcall 1@s, easier to overcall 1NT perhaps|pg||
nt|granguru:  probasbly e could have avoided the mistake overtaking @D and playing @c9|pg||
nt|paulg:  west cannot make a penalty double these days|pg||
nt|rodal f: Whom to reach NY as low as possible?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again 1Nt with a 5 card @S - |pg||
nt|rodal f: *NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat: and now ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 1NT 12-16 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North was in 3NT at the other table, doubled and ran to 4@D.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h will be hearts and a minor, so North asks|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1NTx was sort of +380 but Soith escapes|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok: 2@d showed a 11-13 hand with 3@h. sry for this mess, but its really difficult to guess the meaning of ART bids. And its boring to be silent... :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not much point reaching New York - they need to stay in Poznan for a few more days|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h from N now! |pg||
pc|c4|nt|murat: not the best lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3d could be makable but tokay wasnt sure about 5 cards @d|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS guessing can win 3@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1D! negative, 0-6(7) |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like dbl from E. Ha has a 5-card @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry he....|pg||
nt|sfranchino: perhaps they use double in 4 position strong if not any sense pass from south|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: is Ventin from Argentina or spain?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|suketbombi: i may not be able to anser all individual chats pl no offence meant anyway multi tasking here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rcerreto:  do EW play transfer?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Transfers opposite 1@C are popular.|pg||
nt|granguru:  we will see a good fight here|pg||
nt|granguru:  as 2@S is a difficult contract to win|pg||
nt|ntmon: or not|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: With four aces missing, it seems that the three-level may be high enough.|pg||
nt|pelu: that the problem with 1@D opening - partner dont know if u have 2 or 5 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: some play for 4@s - but US never found the @s-fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  mmm|pg||
nt|granguru:  Does S have nothing clear  to lead?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chmitty: and Lauria does not give up|pg||
nt|riccho:  ok this looks obvious here :) |pg||
nt|riccho:  15 vs. 8 HCP --> both players are a bit exaggerating their hands|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: Not knowing their system, North's Pass might have included better hands, and wek hands run immediately via Rdbl, that is one way of playing|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure how obvious is 3NT by East ... he is min, and 2 open suits ... OK, has 3 tens and 5-card @C ... still|pg||
nt|riccho:  now decl has 9 tricks in his bag. I c no other option than to play for @c to be 3-3 (or Hx somewhere). |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong lead .... and big diff. |pg||
nt|dburn: one more round of the Swiss, and both teams occupying places in the low teens with 27 qualifiers|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Obviously East had read West for a much better hand than he holds.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and I can´t see why...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|riccho:  E needs 33 in @c without alternative, because due to communication problems he has to duck @c immediately |pg||
nt|ntmon: looks like 1@D showing @h, 1@S nat forcing, 2@C weak preference, 2@H good hand|pg||
nt|daman: makes sense to me|pg||
nt|dburn: so both of them are well enough placed not to think about heading to New York (or Australia) just yet|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ntmon: i like transfer responses to 1@C - room for many gadgets|pg||
nt|daman: yes |pg||
nt|daman: I don't think 1@D was a transfer   I think just a negative over the big club|pg||
nt|daman: <7|pg||
nt|runnerup: club ruff -diamond ruff and club ruft with j@h gives chances to defence|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Such a shame to lose IMPs unnecessarily when there are so many other ways of losing IMPs.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  could W consider his hand balanced?|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then open 1NT (or rebidding, if 1NT is weak)?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was presumably non-forcing, so it is hard to see how East had enough to look for an 11-trick game.|pg||
nt|granguru:  well he treated the  hand as a croos ruffing type|pg||
nt|granguru:  and protected potential @d tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Protected diamond tricks I think|pg||
nt|ntmon: then 2@C doesn't make much sense |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If 1@s is´nt spades, 1nt from W looks normal for me |pg||
nt|murat: 9 tricks i guess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another claim i daresay|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|danilo1: ideal def. is I guess -3 ... now  making .. @SAK and small @C|pg||
pc|c8|nt|granguru:  now he is not so sure anymore....|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep ... may be here they are in some "hole" of their system|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|peachy: Although, 2D foes not necessarily promise 4+ diamonds|pg||
nt|daman: it does seem starange|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s seems to have shown hearts - some Italian pairs swap 1@h and 1@s around after this start to the bidding|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: In my opinion, the range 12-16 is susceptible to trouble at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: kib says my suggeswted method is common in Hungary, but we still dont know if NS play that way|pg||
nt|riccho:  with 23 HCP and no fit you have to be lucky to succeed in 3NT... |pg||
nt|danilo1: wrong = unlucky (lead) |pg||
nt|daman: strange*|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|granguru:  as we see, he changed his mind but fortunatelly N had a @S left|pg||
nt|peachy: if EW play 2/1 (which I do not know if they do)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no idea Michal the flag says spain|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|danilo1: waw :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  leading and slam bidding are the most expensive parts of team playing. This is another proof of that... |pg||
nt|danilo1: did he really believe that Cezary would play @C from Jxx?|pg||
nt|riccho:  declarer - much to his discomfort - found another way of handling the @c suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry gotg held up|pg||
nt|daman: Hi John|pg||
pc|c9|nt|buddyshah: same lead in OR  but  PS  play A and Small @S  saving a trick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: hi John|pg||
nt|dburn: other pairs use double to promise hearts, and 1@h to show spades|pg||
nt|dburn: some antedliuvian folk persist in bidding the suits they have, but they're all in Swiss B by now|pg||
nt|danilo1: what would happe if North did not ruff, @DK, but discrad @S instead?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I was asked twice the question "what are these people doing here" :)  probably looking at the strane flag combinations|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this is the European Opan Championship|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Open|pg||
nt|granguru:  excelent defense after all|pg||
pc|c6|nt|danilo1: Adam will resolve problem ... if declar would have @HK, he will not be in hurry with @S unblock|pg||
nt|riccho:  decl may have trusted the length signal from S (it it was one...). DoesnÂ´t he know Balicki - Zmudzinski then? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: hiya |pg||
pc|h5|nt|suketbombi: this is a good board for texan|pg||

pc|dT|nt|chmitty: As usual, Lauria "manipulates" his cards for his best benefit and will claim 8 tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure - may gain a trick, but this looks one down at any rate|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is good as well|pg||

nt|runnerup: you need take @d ruff here|pg||

nt|suketbombi: yes can escape for 200 on a@S guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some might play a weak-strong 2NT on the East cards, to differentiate between strong and distributional 3@D hands.|pg||
nt|pelu: what a lead - but he will have a new chance later|pg||
nt|riccho:  heh|pg||
nt|sfranchino: 1nt double and 2@s pass |pg||
nt|sfranchino: any sense again|pg||
nt|sfranchino: this match is full of nonsense|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rcerreto:  no way to play trumps from N|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  then it should make|pg||
nt|murat: anybody dbl with east hand ?|pg||
nt|peachy: Molenaar must have at least thought of balancing|pg||
nt|granguru:  leslie amoils is a canadian player...wonder why she has the USA flag here|pg||
nt|pelu: what would u bid? |pg||
nt|suketbombi: i think we all need to be careful B$ chossing the words |pg||
nt|sfranchino: if i double 1nt which is the reason for no double 2@s?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: B4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rcerreto:  even misguessing @d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not me|pg||
nt|murat: i mean after 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|paulg:  standard Polish lead, second highest from three|pg||
nt|granguru:  @SQ9 big helpers|pg||
nt|chmitty: let's see if declarer finds the way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: a @c at trick 2 would reveal most of the layout|pg||
nt|chmitty: North can see that East does not hold AK or KDJ @c|pg||
nt|chmitty: and not QJ@h either|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: Plenty to think about before playing trick 1|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  oops|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  they found the way|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Both losing semifinalists are awarded bronze medals. There is no playoff for third place (a good decision in my view)|pg||
nt|brolucius: East hoping for a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  yes, 3rd-4th place finals are dull|pg||
nt|brolucius: But neither team has a bronze medal in their sights at this moment.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  winning A and playing a @h back would have forced S to play trumps but...|pg||
nt|danilo1: to lead for ruff is good when one has blank hand|pg||
nt|dburn: and if North-South keep bidding black suits, a diamond will look more and more clear|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rcerreto:  this way has a chance to discard a @h on @s|pg||
nt|pelu: why sh he X?|pg||
nt|pelu: and penalyse pd for a 3. hand opening? - u dont X in teams if u only exp down 1 - u pass and collect|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rcerreto:  a very good chance now|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda5.html  running now|pg||
nt|petergill: Cue bids are 1st/2nd, so N has denied @d control|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... @D lead is bid :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ntmon: more sporting contract but makes|pg||
nt|daman: I did not expect 4@S to be the final contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who would. another did you buy a lottery ticket hand|pg||
nt|dburn: too much science can be as bad as too little|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: looks like 4 losers but declarer will still look for an endplay to get rid of the@s loser|pg||
nt|murat: for a save or for some money|pg||
nt|jcomyn: missin just the KQ10876 of trumps|pg||
nt|daman: over 2@S   North could have bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ntmon: if N was afraid 1@H being passed out, should have bid 2@H|pg||
nt|daman: or    South could simply have bid 2@D over 1@S|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would bring 2@S if S has them for sure|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ntmon: i would feel elevated with S hand as such and did some cunning bidding, at least 4@D splinter |pg||
pc|c9|nt|riccho:  another time to misguess sth for E here. Difficult to be right here after u mangled a hand like the one before. will be interesting to c if E is still inspired enought|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wrong defence. let W win the first trick and he will continue with trump|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: score now 13-1 for Lavazza|pg||
nt|chmitty: is this the actual play ????|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer does not know that DA drops doubleton, he took a chance that E lead from QJxxx|pg||
nt|danilo1: another case for invitational bid ... and pass ... especiall when playing vs. excellent defenders ... |pg||
nt|riccho:  he should do it right anyway: S didnt open but showed @hAK now|pg||
nt|danilo1: this will go down much easier (unf. also less :))|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|danilo1: Diorgio shouldplay @D10 for ruff|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|granguru:  Leslie should be Les Amoils, male, lived in South Africa before coming to Canada|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: perhaps, but there isn't any pressing need for West to play a club - South did cue the suit, after all|pg||
nt|runnerup: sementa dont trust him :) -so good bridge -thoughtfull|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: @s4 sh ask for @c|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes u are right|pg||
nt|pelu: u can see all 52 cards, Stefano - the players cant|pg||
nt|sfranchino: one time the big player Dano De Falco said to me: when u double a partial contratc lead always with a trump|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|granguru:  probably with USA flag because Kamil's team is register as such|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was just made on the deal where E/W went two down in 4@C, so 8 IMPs to Zimmermann.|pg||
nt|pelu: that a DD analyse|pg||
nt|danilo1: still ... -2 |pg||
nt|suketbombi: agree peter he was weary about the 3rd seat opening anyway he was like a person who was relieved that he does need to double again|pg||
nt|sfranchino: yes peter but i see also my opening pard|pg||
nt|sfranchino: if i double 1nt penalty how is possible pass over 2@s? i said only this|pg||
nt|suketbombi: so @S was guessed in OR in that 1nt X|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure, MY good friend Dano, would also pass here :):)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|riccho:  Helgemo helness agreed with the bidding in bd 6 (but not in the play: +14 imps for monaco z)|pg||
nt|dburn: and besides, why should he play the ten and set up South's eight when, left to his own devices, South will play West for the ten anyway?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: if u X for 1 down odds are against u: 3 / 5 IMP|pg||
nt|murat: right|pg||
nt|pelu: vuln and 2 / 5 non vuln|pg||
nt|MolvaM: baldursson has too many high cards and has to defend carefully to avoid being thrown in|pg||
nt|murat: he should win with the king now|pg||
nt|chmitty: I think he is wrong : Versace would not easily raise to 2@h with xxx cards|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: Very recent photo of Ish and Ash (i.e. NS) at http://www.abf.com.au/events/vcc/vccPhotos.asp?2011|pg||
nt|sfranchino: :) i know he is very conservative but i think that in this hand double from south is obbligatory perhaps he had afraid about light opening pard in 3 position|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Too many  lost opporutnities for Texans   in 7 boards,  so  stefano  is  somewhat  correct.    However other table in 2@H    so  3-5  more for texans |pg||
nt|sfranchino: anyway i risk same and i double :) if not i no double 1nt...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|ntmon: 2 off|pg||
pc|d4|nt|murat: or else he'll be endplayed|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sfranchino: A@d and @c|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: That I  am not so sure about|pg||
nt|chmitty: and on top of that there is no reason for East to underlead QJ@h at trick 1|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes stefano you would be right here buth thay have maged to get 5 imps here slow and steady wins the race:)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|pelu: S sh duck and hope for 6 card @S in East|pg||

nt|pelu: tx Michal|pg||
nt|murat: i am told 4@h made by Bocchi at OR|pg||

nt|athene: hoping east would play his partner for @HKx and duck trying to beat it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|psyck: all in with the minor J's dropping|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|athene: actually even @HJx would be enough as there would be a trump promotion on spades|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: and @HJ|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: but east wisely decided that declarer would never play like that missing the @HK|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kista: 7N makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vugraphpl5: there are alerts on all after 2@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphpl5: every bid|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ is a very valuable card and they might not be able to find that|pg||
nt|athene: i assume north has found out that south is 2-4-3-4 with 5 AKQ points|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, likely will end in 6N, as other table did|pg||
nt|kista: The black Jacks are very crucial for the 13th trick|pg||
nt|athene: probably he found that out by about 3@H or 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: Extactly. 2434 with 5AKQ points as confirmed by S|pg||
nt|athene: so he knows he is facing @Sxx @HAxxx @DKxx @Cxxxx|pg||
nt|athene: and he just needs to know about @SJ, @CJ, @DJ|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: S put a wrong bidding card on the tray showing @CK|pg||
nt|athene: not sure you need them all for 7 to be decent|pg||
nt|kista: need the black j's|pg||
nt|athene: you might get a diamond lead but a spade is more likely|pg||
nt|athene: against 7nt west would know nothing about the dummy but everything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|athene: and a lead up to the doubleton would seem safest|pg||
nt|kista: std auction maybe more challenging here|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: how did they make only twelve tricks in the closed room?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they led a heart towards the queen early|pg||
nt|psyck: played @h to Q early|pg||
nt|kista: he may have played a @h earlier |pg||
nt|athene: just trying to maximise chances for 12 assuming neither minor suit comes home|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: if you could play two rounds of diamonds first you would know you were going for 13, not 12|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe you need the diamonds for transportation|pg||

mb|2C|an| |nt|granguru:  S multi 2@D|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for Meckwell in the other room (probably not the last time we'll say that in this championship)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  I've noticed many pairs treat the Multi 2@d as weak with spades when it comes to their 2nd seat defence|pg||
nt|pelu: and 5@H close to make on a small @S-lead |pg||
nt|paulg:  it's rare to see that in the UK, but would work here|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@h from North?|pg||
nt|ntmon: krajewski in the meantime gains with a series of mid-sized profits|pg||
nt|daman: must be a canape opening|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|Walddk3: No credit for my hy-phen?|pg||

nt|granguru:  Amoil played for SA in the world teams in bermuda 2000 |pg||
nt|peachy: really light third-seater here|pg||
nt|vugraphplb: i thought that he is from Usa becouse he doesn't exist in EBL base|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  that is the norm in the UK too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt i suppose|pg||
nt|ntmon: strong @C variety, finally|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|paulg:  4@d will be 'bid your major' (4@c would have been transfer to your major)|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes many play 2@D x= short in @S |pg||
nt|daman: this auction should show longer @Ss than @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by West|pg||
nt|granguru:  and 2@d - 2@h 5+ @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is similar to the situation in the Open Room, where West doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: forcing pass in N?|pg||
nt|rodal f: And done we are|pg||
nt|pelu: when both minor J's drop there are 13 toptricks|pg||
nt|sfranchino: intersting 2@h...4|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|brolucius: Be careful because jtr is watching.|pg||
nt|granguru:  now a correct flag in W ...thanks Michal|pg||
nt|peachy: and another 16+ 1C here, maybe they have additional agreements on what constitutes a 1C opening that we do not know about |pg||
nt|ntmon: XX = transfer to @H ?|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 2 H = @H otr BAL|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: ??? dbl from me as E|pg||
nt|paulg:  surely not a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmmm 24 hcp and want to defend 1s - verybrave|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|pelu: but East help him, in on @CK he played @D - ruff, @C to A @S to 10 and duck - and now endplayed - East sh play @C back and no endplay|pg||
nt|suketbombi: this one is a grand again  but needs both @DS & @CS to behave if only @Cs then Viena coup and........|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto:  a cheap save on 4@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S has escaped a double, but the cards lie well for declarer so the lack of a double will not cost E/W much.|pg||
nt|granguru:  In the meanwhile NS surpassed the safet level of 5@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  is 6@C makeable?|pg||
nt|granguru:  after A GAROZZO's lead|pg||
nt|peachy: on the surface, looks like just lose a spade, whether the tricks are there is another matter|pg||
nt|peachy: Kib who knows NS style says they love to surprise opps with frequent tactical bids|pg||
nt|riccho:  1 trick in every suit for ew = just make|pg||
nt|dburn: nervous for South - the kind of hand where if you overcall and get doubled, you know you are going down a lot against nothing|pg||
mb|3H|nt|danilo1: despite 3NT looks makable for NS ... good defense should beat it ... so good stop|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but still a dbl....|pg||
nt|granguru:  2 discards on reds|pg||
nt|chmitty: as long as they do not surprise themselves that's fine :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: why not - u have bid game Red against green |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: its for me a good standard rule|pg||
nt|chmitty: Full brakes on, from North's standpoint|pg||
nt|chmitty: South has a lot ... can he give up ?|pg||
nt|peachy: 6 controls opposite strong club, he just cant pass|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: choice of plays - hate thast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably play on d and postpone finesses|pg||
nt|ntmon: on  17, meckwell started as reccomended: 1@S-2N-4@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps @H finesse, if ducked revert to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: little point in ducking|pg||
nt|ntmon: not an easy hand due to communication problems|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so many choices|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Had the cards lain differently, not doubling might have waved goodbye to 500 or so.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may have feared a third-hand opener, but her side was vulnerable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not know that partner holds 10 points, so he cannot double 4@S even with an extra value or so. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but shouldn´t E?|pg||
nt|pelu: now N can make 1NT - topplay @Hs and only 6 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  3 discards on reds sorry|pg||
nt|granguru:  one @S given up|pg||
nt|pelu: most pairs use 2@S as the 2. relay - to get the Nt on the strong hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: many possiblities but by no stech a good grand|pg||
mb|6N|nt|sfranchino: what a bid horrible|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: The contract is doubled at both tables in the other match|pg||
nt|granguru:  so just one ruff needed|pg||
nt|peachy: It is also possible that 4S was RKC|pg||
nt|sfranchino: horrible play also south and points are dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: vugraph schedule for future matches    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Quite right.|pg||
nt|chmitty: May be 4@s was kind of blackwood|pg||
nt|sfranchino: horrible|pg||
nt|suketbombi: you want to be in a grand stefano?|pg||
nt|pelu: the Swedish @C-system also got the Nt in SA|pg||
nt|sfranchino: dont understand the sense of 2@h from north|pg||
nt|sfranchino: bridge is easy 2@c 2@d 2NT if south has interest for majors he can bid 3@c|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 2@H = @H or  BALANCE hand|pg||
nt|sfranchino: and 2@c 2@d 2NT ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: it does make|pg||
nt|granguru:  not even garozzo beats 6@c here|pg||
nt|petergill: NS needs to get their @d trick before the @h are set up|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he can't pass - and even when del Monte can pass, he often doesn't|pg||
nt|sfranchino: so he can play from the right side|pg||
nt|buddyshah: i think  shows  @C suit in their system|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: WD White House team|pg||
nt|peachy: It would be nice if in a competition of this level, there were convention cards available|pg||
nt|chmitty: true :(|pg||
nt|chmitty: True also that there are many pairs in competition : huge job|pg||
nt|peachy: It makes kibitzing so much nicer, to know what the auction means|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chmitty: a suggestion could be that the players had to fill themselves an "electronic convention card" before the championship|pg||
nt|ntmon: right, John :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: its a headache hand |pg||
nt|ntmon: agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: d suit may die now|pg||

nt|chmitty: that will come soon, I'm sure|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Stefano I suggest you look at their convention card they may not be playing same system as you do|pg||
pc|s3|nt|murat: he should played the Ace @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: N with shut down with XX showing @H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: and just did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont think he found the best line entries are very short for finessing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant even get a s if d is returned|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 2Nt by S show his values - balanced and 7-9 ?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  it is a good standard rule for me too, but not when one hand has pre-empted|pg||
nt|petergill: Good @S play - now S has to decide - @HQ or @DK|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now East may grab @CA.|pg||
nt|dburn: chances are that since East didn't double here South might get the clubs wrong|pg||
pc|h4|nt|runnerup: south missed another chance|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|murat: now he's in trouble|pg||
nt|pelu: so are very normal bid by N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: for me "multi" is nor real preemt - just a semicontructiv opening bid|pg||
nt|dburn: unusual, that - South's concentration may have slipped for a moment|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: wrong @hA ok if 3-3 and @H 10 nevber correct|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  should she risk -420 to get 100 instead of 50?|pg||
nt|dburn: risk? what risk?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to risk a double in the first place.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: An excellent 6@D now|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer could have the singleton king of clubs only if she had about ten cards rather than thirteen|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  can declarer have one more @d one less @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on NS - a nice contract|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  N was declarer, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In theory, there is a club ruff, but fortunately for declarer, the defender with the singleton club also has @DA|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting bidding test. If they bid it, I will applaud.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C is more tricky and that might be reached.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: They may arrive in 6@C, though|pg||
nt|Walddk3: With problems on a spade lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can they make 1C after a @c lead? I doubt|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the sort of board we were hoping for. No-one wants these matches to be decided on small margins after some drab boards.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @s lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c after a @s lead....|pg||
nt|peachy: In "real" championships, I think that is how it is done, these championships are open to anybody who wants enter from anywhere in the world, no qualification required|pg||
nt|danilo1: running scores now on: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|riccho:  a matter of style and system if u open the N hand with 1@c 2@c or 3@c|pg||
nt|riccho:  or even pass |pg||
nt|riccho:  3@c wouldnÂ´t be my choice anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i venture to say this was misplayed|pg||
nt|daman: good stuff for EW|pg||
nt|daman: N will open 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|brolucius: If one side wins after doing better on the big boards, then good luck to them - (even if they are not from England)|pg||
nt|murat: that was unexpected|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the contract went both ways during play and finally declarer came out as the winner|pg||
nt|paulg:  Seeing your partner pass when you have a balanced zero count is never good|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table on Bd 7: East bid 2@S after 1@H P 2@C, so W led @S to 4@H|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|an| |nt|pelu: 34 HCP - I exp slam with most tables|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s now from South?|pg||
nt|peachy: And teams can have members from any country = all transnational|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C precision style ... part of Polish @C system|pg||
nt|dburn: then, this match may be close to a tie after 7 and 8 are scored|pg||
mb|2H|nt|riccho:  so a precision like 2@c opening here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays @d before havinc cleaned trumps, another @s will set up a trumph trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: D'Ovidio has started well by emphasizing the diamonds before supporting clubs.|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS has a score sheet we all like to bring to the comparison table...all NS scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 6@C in the closed room|pg||

nt|suketbombi: please dont get upst with that 1@H bid it is a transer to @S|pg||

nt|granguru:  7@D should be|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: Ouch!|pg||
nt|murat: would you also prefer 2@s ?|pg||
nt|pelu: now @SA and 2x@c = down 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Imagine winning the board with 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade lead would not beat 3NT if clubs were 3-2.|pg||
nt|brolucius: not beat 6@C, I mean|pg||
nt|dburn: a result with which both teams will be quite happy - it won't hurt either's chances for qualification|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: true!|pg||
nt|paulg:  tougher when you have not shown your 5-card support for partner|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: roller-coaster :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|MolvaM: this is interesting|pg||
nt|murat: Tokay should work some |pg||
nt|MolvaM: has to keep south out|pg||
nt|riccho:  to duck wont help here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|granguru:  Even if that doesnt mean anything, usually it is a good sign...|pg||
nt|chmitty: Lauria could hold : Kx KQ10xxx x Kxxx whixh would produce an excellent slam|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer does not know how hearts sit so he might duck one, but as it is, does not matter|pg||
nt|riccho:  or?|pg||
nt|riccho:  it helps: decl can develop 3 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|pelu: not DD but in practic play|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: bidding on bd 18 has taken off to 4nt already|pg||
nt|petergill: If NS can lock declarer out of dummy, 3@H will fail|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: would u X in West or bid 2Nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would have started with 2@d (inverted) personally, even if showing your 4-card major first seems to be growing in popularity|pg||
nt|daman: it isn't so much what they can make    can they reasonably bid over the 4@H opening?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda4.html|pg||

nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Once all matches a completed, standings in each group will be here http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|chmitty: Lauria considering his options in case @h are 4-1|pg||
nt|peachy: there are 15 groups of 8 teams each|pg||
nt|chmitty: only danger to consider|pg||
nt|chmitty: ha can : a) play Ace @h and @h or b) play small @h to retain an extra entry in dummy or c) unblock @s ace and run Q @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no of course not unless someone doubles|pg||
nt|runnerup: go down |pg||
nt|dburn: they can do that all right - but a shift to @c9 might have been a trick more effective|pg||
nt|danilo1: @S back cannot cost|pg||
nt|runnerup: hand that is but club overruff comes anyway i think|pg||
nt|danilo1: lol :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: srry, private|pg||
nt|runnerup: south sees dummy -so i cant understand any but @s |pg||
nt|petergill: I think 27 teams qualify from Swiss A (i.e. this Section) and 5 from Swiss B, into the 28 board Knockout matches.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if @S and @S now ... Thk Giorgio will play on @HK doubleton|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: but then u would mis a 4-4 fit in @H - pd could be 4-4-3-2|pg||
nt|danilo1: since @D bad ... declare cannot come to 9 trick on time .. before Nort enters with @SK 8if Cezary just continues @C)|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
pc|cA|nt|murat: dbl i guess|pg||
nt|pelu: for 100% 2NT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I would bid 2nt|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT = 16-19, D + 2Nt = 20+|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: jassem may be lucky|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: but he can finess @H10|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|runnerup: 9 better|pg||
nt|sfranchino: @d to ace and play small @h finesse to 10|pg||
pc|h6|nt|MolvaM: whenever I double, lefty bids 4@h and pd bids 4@s with 4 cards|pg||
nt|danilo1: now made ... time for 3@S tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chmitty: he has choosen option a) :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: and we can see he is still Ok because South is endplayed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|murat: i prefer 2NT with 15-17 |pg||

nt|riccho:  now he has 9 tricks in his bag |pg||
nt|danilo1: nice @C|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: Doubledummy = seeing all four hands, ducking is wrong. Not seeing all four hands, it is a normal play|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|d4|nt|pelu: many play that 1@D - 2@D = no 4 card major|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW could not X tor T/O w/o @S|pg||
nt|sfranchino: Q@h?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: So, 20+ IMPs swing due to a 4-1 break. Well, that's part of the game. Hard to take, though.|pg||
nt|murat: he was afraid of Q@c |pg||
nt|danilo1: @C continuation would beat|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: @cQ and @S back and Tokay will regret that he used his only entry to dummy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kibs are shocked... to play clubs from hand is purely double dummy. he cant do that|pg||
nt|pelu: but against storng defense his plan sh fail|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he can hope that @cA is with north but very hard to play for both honors to be there|pg||
nt|pelu: if S has showed distrbution in the black suits - and easy defense for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well some days even 2 club tricks could be enough|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he could catch the @dQ|pg||
nt|murat: he's hopeless now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so to play for @cQx inside is not a terrible play|pg||

nt|ntmon: 2@D must have promised @S|pg||
nt|sfranchino: a nice gadgest very simple is use 1@h 2@h 9-11 3 trumps support with one bid u can solve all u problems and use 1nt forcing 1 round|pg||

nt|peachy: Kibitzers, you are the life of this party, appreciate all your comments and questions!|pg||
nt|dburn: not much in this, I guess - a club lead might beat 3NT, but I can't see why South would lead a club|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  I think 1NT as semi-forcing is quite popular, where North might pass 1NT?|pg||
nt|riccho:  some work here for decl to deny 6 defensive tricks here|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice lead by Martens|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: hate that bidding - cant find a 4-4 s fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: would be a nice lead against 4@S if reached|pg||
nt|ntmon: another odd gain on  20 - on missinng the right contract?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the world-wide disease - find some level of nt as soon as possible|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The official site has a score of 30-27 in this match. Not easy to know what to believe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cronier may fear a diamond ruff in 6@S, because he has offered the lower-scoring slam with excellent spade support.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to our commentators peter lund, and murat anter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and our operator michal |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|pelu: and 1Nt semiforcing? - I hate that "semi" partner pass when I like him to bid, and bid when i like him to pass - So I never play that concvention :)|pg||

nt|suketbombi: yes you have a point venkatesh proabably had a 2@H bid but may have been more constructive i guess|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: next match in 30 min|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: careful play by Bach - Duboin was going to put in the @d8, so it was as well that North didn't let him|pg||
nt|sfranchino: 1@h 2@h 9-11 3 trumps support 1@h 2NT 9-11 4 trumps support 1@h-3@h bad 1@h 2x forcing game 1@h 1NT forcing limited to 10-11 so u can report to @h in a weak hand with support|pg||

nt|MolvaM: but better check later with the website|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.poznan2011.pl/results|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for instance here, 2@C generally shows 4+ for meck and 3+ for roddy :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting difference in styles|pg||
nt|paulg:  I thought these top pairs/teams were supposed to simulate these situations and get a consensus|pg||
nt|pelu: how do they explai that on CC?|pg||
mc|7|nt|danilo1: tk -1 ... opening @H trick to def |pg||
nt|riccho:  but there are as usual other considerations to make as well|pg||

nt|psyck: Looks like they can bid upto 10@h here, but will run out of bidding cards before that|pg||
nt|athene: but after 1@H north will need a lot of persuading to stop below seven|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: looks as though they used some modern form of the grand slam force (5nt after suit agreement) in the other room|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: traditionally, that just asked partner to bid seven with two of the top three trump honours|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, S could have shown one of A or K with 6@d|pg||
mb|4N|nt|psyck: & no extra @h length too maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but these days people use the space a bit more where possible|pg||
nt|psyck: there are too many variations of GSF...|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|athene: 7@H is an underbid if anything, once partner can bid 4nt himself|pg||

nt|Walddk3: The English pair bid the higher scoring slam on 24, 6@S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the @H T will end his agony  so 7  tricks to the happy man|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pelu: 2NT sh be GF - and then use Bergen with 6-8 (3@D), and 9-11 (3@c)|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|Walddk3: 2 IMPs back|pg||
nt|brolucius: Premature for South to bid 3NT. Quite rightly, she asks for more information with 3@C.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Could be 30-29|pg||

nt|pelu: no only 7 with 2 H, can show A or K|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North has a hopeless hand for Blackwood and suggests a slam by cue-bidding his club control. A good bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 6@D = A or K, 6@C = Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if asking in S u can even show 5-6 card suit and no H|pg||

pc|h4|nt|brolucius: With her club honors wasted, South signed off.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but looks like S downgraded her hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was never going to stop out of six once partner had bid 2@D and then agreed hearts.|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: with @d 3--3 and @dK on side....|pg||

nt|psyck: I was hoping for 15 rounds of bidding though :(|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play two-tier splinters so they can differentiate between singleton and void|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: si;p|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so for example after 1@H, 3@S = any singleton and 3NT/4@C/4@D = void|pg||

nt|athene: winning the first spade looked definite option|pg||
nt|athene: now on a club shift, and another club after the @DA, you don't have any chance of using hearts|pg||
nt|athene: win first spade and knock out the @DA and you have more chances for overtricks surely|pg||
nt|athene: since the spades are very likely to be blocked|pg||
nt|athene: east would lead a big one from KQ10x or something like that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: if the spades are 4-2 you have time to set up a heart and just lose three spades and two red aces|pg||
