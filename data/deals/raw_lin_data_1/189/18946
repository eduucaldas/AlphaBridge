nt|hedyg: and EW landed in 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: @S partscore to EW|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27+5 = 32 teams will qualify for the knockouts. members of the eliminated teams can enjoy the open pairs event starting tomorrow|pg||
nt|dburn: but this match will be fast - both teams are sure to qualify, there is no carry-over, so they will save their energies for the knock-out stages|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/usa2/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not now he wont|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: is that supposed to be a rubbish multi?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= multi, 2M= 10-13|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl =diamonds?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so this is max 9 hcps|pg||
nt|dburn: well, rubbish is as rubbish goes - that's pretty sound, not vulnerable in first seat|pg||
nt|hedyg: i never consider a 6-4 hand as rubbish anyhow|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok bid your suit is the consensus for rdbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass would show @ds, not XX|pg||
nt|dburn: but I would be surprised to find that redouble showed diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: some play that redoubled means "I don't want to compete" - they would bid 2@s to mean "I want to compete in hearts, but not spades"|pg||
nt|roswolf: americans have a marked weakness against the multi -i t is extremely discouraged in the state|pg||
nt|3for3: that is how we play the redouble.  not sure it is best. since they are often in trouble when they enter with balanced garbage|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is no carryover to the round of 32|pg||
nt|roswolf: you would hope meckwell at least have sensible methods|pg||
nt|3for3: they do play sensible methods.  but doubling 2@D is not free, especially when the partner of the multi has some diamond length|pg||
nt|hedyg: to pass with @ds is normal i believe as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 6+ @ds|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would ignore the rdbl and bid 3@C SHOWING VALUES + clubs(going via leb would be weaker)|pg||
nt|3for3: meck usually isnt this slow|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm is south choosing between 3@C OR 4@c?|pg||
nt|dburn: he may be asking questions of West, of course|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|woozle: 6NT has chances with a spade lead - four spades, three hearts, three diamonds, one club and a squeeze on south|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but ns might get busy in h|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s was intermediate?|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs tell me XX used to be bid your major  for EW|pg||
nt|3for3: it might be west who is thinking, but i doubt it.|pg||
nt|3for3: usually these auctions are fairly automatic for the multi side.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i had assumed that rodwell's dbl showed 12-15 bal or very strong -does anyone know for sure?|pg||
nt|dburn: doesn't look as though redouble was diamonds, at any rate - West would have bid if it did|pg||
nt|3for3: i would bet with you |pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Mahaffey probably thinks he conceeded a swing in previous board..|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as long as s passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: but higher suit probably wins|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3@c was obviously value-showing, given North's 3NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: Fiona Brown is very cautious with her barren 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive reopening by north|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|MolvaM: 10-13 I am told ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: some may have doubled as east-t/o of course|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or 11-13 I am also told  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@C here on ice|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no CC for NS, soemthing between SEF and 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6nt from east cold as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not yet|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead 4th from longest!|pg||
nt|dburn: and I suppose he might make it, if East doesn't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|jfaria:  after N said he has got the blacks there is no great deal about bidding @c|pg||
mb|2S|nt|3for3: 3nt is reasonable spot. the diamond stopper looks weak, but as long as the clubs run, you just need AK@D in one hand or no @D lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|3for3: they got the latter...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ntmon: .. now :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wikner/Kamras: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJK1.pdf|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: this may not play too well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: four rounds of spades now will put South through the wringer|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi knows his side has a fit - if opps have a 9-card fit you are guaranteed an 8-card fit at least - but that doesn't mean you will find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might bid 4@S with the W hand once he knows about 4 card support since he has no valid defense vs 4@H except the trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can be defeated|pg||
nt|roswolf: the swedes on the first bd bid to 5@D for a game swing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3 bids on a 9 count now what|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|blum1956: A player of the team which is in best 8 will hardly lead a spade against 6NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the bidding could well go 1@s-2@s-4@S at other tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have seen it said that at expert level you should never lead pard's major but lead your own suit and this hand is a good example of why|pg||
pc|c3|nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called by Upmark|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he called TD cause 3NT was bid after a longgggggg huddle by S|pg||
nt|3for3: does the slow bid demonstrably suggest 3nt by Rodwell?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the TD will decide that|pg||
nt|roswolf: in my view yes 3nt is much safer when pard huddles|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time i had received some messages from kibs about the 3NT bid after a long huddle|pg||
nt|3for3: it may be safer.  but it needs to be DEMONSTRABLY suggested...the law's words, not mine|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it again looks that americans cant deal with the multi:)|pg||
nt|dburn: no more than an in-tempo 3@c bid would, I imagine - but we are not the Director, of course|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well who does win now|pg||
nt|athene: west's defensive plan is very easy|pg||
nt|athene: just play spades and spades and spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: and get your three trump tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ilan Herbst went 2 off in OR|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would be better-off to double 3@S rather than bid 4@H, if he feels he has to do something|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think only -1 is likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: competenty done|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 13 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H should be a five-card suit in my opinion|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: he could not do that after his pd doubled 3@S, Bill|pg||
nt|jcomyn: CQ and H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's probable that EW will come to 4@S on many tables either on its own or pushed, but not doubled |pg||
nt|athene: no i mean in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that would be for minors, denying 4@Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is rare that pd, when he doubles 1@s, does not have 4 cards in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: not so rare these days for the top players|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all assume pd has 4 OM when he doubles a M opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is true enough|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think E could antecipate some kind of misfit...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: but why does w keep bidding when he knows big hand on nhis left|pg||
pc|h3|nt|woozle: probably not, but leading from a nothing suit isn't completely safe either - can easily pick up (say) partner's queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody is very worried about the overtrick|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: levazza mean business by the looks of things|pg||
nt|jfaria:  9 tricks is quite a bit in this layout|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|roswolf: ace and another trump lookes obvious as he wasnt in 4|pg||
nt|glen: should declarer have played @S ace then @s|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think doubling just says you don't have the offensive potential in hearts to commit to bidding 4 over 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not good for south|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment bill|pg||
nt|athene: so you  can still have auctions like 1@S X 3@S X pass 4minor pass 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: saying ok, we might want to play here, but we don't have to|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|blum1956: Probably it is a @h raise|pg||

mb|3D|nt|roswolf: i would lead a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: the @SQ is looking for a brillancy prize|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but it depends on what double by eric showed - if a weak nt then it may well be assuming a club fit - but we must remember that defence could have defeated it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H not alerted?|pg||
nt|wstuart: sleeping actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: No doubt, and a toothpick is a weapon but it's not really adequate for a duel|pg||

nt|roswolf: what 3@H would mean is a mystery:)|pg||
nt|athene: ok so with a 3nt bid and only four hearts, south would have done something else|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo responds 2@C on strong balanced hands with a 4-card major|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is to conceal the major if you don't have a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|athene: so if you respond showing a major then bid 3nt you promise 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: another kibber suggests they may use 3@S rebid by south as puppet to 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though NS are doing the same sort of thing|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd for -1?|pg||
nt|dburn: delay perhaps caused by return of Director to table|pg||
nt|3for3: south made an interesting pass of the double of 1@H in CR.  Terrible heart spots.  I'd have bid some number of NT myself|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: They will talk with TD after the match |pg||
nt|jcomyn: still a present of 6 imps|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3C|pg||

nt|glen: hey, canadians own "eh"|pg||

mb|d|nt|jcomyn: boy what happens now|pg||
nt|ntmon: when opps bid 2 suits and we look for 3NT, we bid the suit we have stopped |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 4+|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult salm to reach 6@D seems clearly superior|pg||
nt|athene: NS can bid lots of hearts but that will only encourage east to bid a slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok here is the CC for NS now: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJKeng.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be awkward for n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: which is the awkward part?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes all this early morning excitement is a bit much for an aul fella like me|pg||
nt|jfaria:  no reason to play anything else but 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ntmon: but i agree .. NS on the way to problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart lead against nt is marked lucky east has 10xxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: getting to grand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: At the other table, North switched to a diamond at trick two, but chose the lowest...South, duly misled, led one back|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S will make if the defence foolishly try to cash @HAK, but not if they switch to a club to take out the entry to the diamonds, of course|pg||
nt|glen: thanks Hedy, typical swedish cc, very little blank space left|pg||
nt|dburn: Kokish hasn't yet managed to persuade Rodwell to overcall 1@s instead of doubling|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: heart lead and low spade switch?|pg||
nt|granguru:  and west @HJx|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: like well into the soup|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I'm still bidding 3c on the s hand before you have your blood spilled|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh then @sA disappears|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is on in many denominations and level is difficult to judge too|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2 nt must be several layouts, otherwise I doubt W would enter tehe auction|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ntmon: the only problem with 3@C is that should not be enough |pg||
nt|ntmon: at least they're on the same wavelenght|pg||
nt|roswolf: advance sac taken|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX doesnt even start to show this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: it really makes no difference to their qualifications|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, now 4@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree hedy|pg||
nt|3for3: kokish basically believes there is no hand too strong to overcall.  Rodwell doesn't see it that way here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|MolvaM: even if misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|hedyg: anything is fine as long as they avoid 5@ds|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i think duboin was taking the time to light the proverbial cigarette|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: much of a muchness|pg||

pc|s5|nt|roswolf: the grand is missed i fear|pg||
nt|hedyg: Thomas thinks XX shows 3 @ss only|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 4 card fit and singleton @c he had other bids available|pg||
nt|roswolf: meckwell will probably have a similar challenge in the other room|pg||
pc|sA|nt|blum1956: clear pass for North on 2@s from my point of view, but Pszczola is a world champion which I am not|pg||

pc|dK|nt|mcarroll: they did well to stop below game, but even this is probably not going to make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: seems Madala decided they would take no @H tricks if EW played|pg||
nt|glen: and the cash out stops at 4 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: better cash the K@H now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder if n passes what happens|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ntmon: reaching 4@H X would not be problem on tables, where W passes and E opens with @S preeemt|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that may mean an imp to the israelis|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: they took all their tricks|pg||

nt|3for3: I like a low club better than the king|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|woozle: only two certain losers, but I'm not sure how many winners|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the @D lead signposted|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is GF raise with singleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D shows 1 singleton(unspecified) + gf i am told|pg||
nt|athene: some specs might be wondering why east didn't just double|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: there are two possible explanations|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcomyn: finding h here will be tricky|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and game on|pg||
nt|athene: firstly they might play x as t/o of hearts (unlikely)|pg||
nt|glen: the modern style: bid five card majors, count points later|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= semi-forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT general gametrial..|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@d has some sort of play - not sure how good a contract it is|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: secondly he just wants to emphasize he has real playing strength in diamonds so there might be a sac|pg||
nt|glen: the semi-forcing NT allows for opener, once having counted points, to pass to avoid trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: the term semi-forcing will always be a puzzle to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy +90|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus it is NOT forcing?|pg||
nt|hedyg: or just 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: whereas a lead-directing double could be as little as @DKQ10x or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: trumps 3-2 plus some work, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: much depends on methods now|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice no XX from Gino to show Kx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean: it is either forcing or it isnt?|pg||
nt|granguru:  correct|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1NT conventionally asks for point count? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: well your supposed to bid again if you have a decent hand very like drury without the guaranteed trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: , see above |pg||
nt|glen: semi-forcing is a terrible term, but was meant to distinguish between 1NT not-forcing limited to about 10 pts, and the modern style where it can have game invite values|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to pass surely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  doubt trading a plus for a a minus|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blum1956: not enough entries to make the @d s work and too bad @h distribution to crossruff effectively|pg||
nt|woozle: On the last board, Harding in the other room tried 3NT with the matching 4333s - down one also, but had chances for 10 in|pg||
nt|roswolf: brakes need to be applied now|pg||
nt|roswolf: simple auction|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: it is a terrible term indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but rarely does in my experience|pg||
nt|granguru:  for me semif means "you may pass if you have a sub min hand  or a min with a bal distr"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|3for3: i'd say more than some :)|pg||
nt|3for3: but the black JT's are very useful|pg||
nt|hedyg: iv) For the KO stage, teams not in the first eight rankings in the Swiss A are re-ranked from 9-32 according to seeding based on WBF/EBL masterpoints. The teams ranked 1-8 in the ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Swiss A, in order, each pick a team from the rest of the teams seeded 9 to 32. After these first eight choices the right to select the opponent passes to the highest remaining ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: seeded team and so on until the bracket is completed. For the purposes of composing brackets the number in the bracket is |pg||
nt|hedyg: determined by the order of the selection|pg||
nt|dburn: if North leads a heart, you have to commit yourself at once - if he doesn't, you have some breathing room|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: OTT|pg||
nt|athene: i guess one other advantage for 4@D over double is it takes some room away from opps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: 6@d by East may be better than 6@d by West for that reason, but there's not a lot the Swedes can do about that now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: which red suit to try is the question|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ntmon: very lucky for NS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|woozle: A bit sad here that the third diamond will be ruffed with the short defensive trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: if Rodwell does lead a heart, he should choose the eight and not the jack|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: since he probably would not lead the jack from KJ|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, declarer may need to pick a black suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: easier for us, as usual|pg||
nt|3for3: those black suits look very similar..|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|pg||

nt|dburn: number 11 buses, these - you can't make six diamonds for hours, and then two come at once|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a nice unlucky game 4 EW|pg||
nt|jfaria:  both red cards misplaced|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very unlucky but should be push|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Andy|pg||
mb|1N|nt|3for3: this looks better than the last one|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: or obsfuscation more like|pg||
nt|andyv:  good evening all|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: we have been seeing a lot of that|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Joao:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: XX= Hx(x) in @H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hey i am old enough already without taking a few hours off me. MORNING so|pg||
mb|3H|nt|glen: 2@C is the science|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: 6@H a good save here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: 2@C is a reverse inverted minor - it shows a raise to the two-level|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@c rather than 1@d was an interesting choice|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 4 Fantunes in 7@s|pg||
nt|dburn: now, if West can bid 4@h as a sort of "last train" or "Bluhmer"...|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: natural or 16/17+ many hand types|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Pepsi bids only 2NT...he apparently has lower standards for vulnerable 2H bids than I do|pg||
nt|woozle: Seamon-Molson raises to say "yes, I did overcall vulnerable"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and the @S Ten is a vital asset|pg||
nt|woozle: I suppose she would never have raised without it|pg||
nt|dburn: ...which apparently he can...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now thats aggressive but i suppose the 5-card suit is useful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice contract|pg||
nt|dburn: ...then East-West have a chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows his hcps, though not heavy , are good|pg||
nt|3for3: not sure what rodwell's double of 4@H was, but it will make it easier, as now east can show heart control.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Upmarks XX= 1st rd control|pg||
nt|jfaria:  played by the "wrong" side, S on lead could try a @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@h probably shows any 4 card without strength being a factor|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ntmon: actually E hand is rather strong in 15-17 range|pg||
nt|ntmon: roles home now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rolls even|pg||
nt|ntmon: rolls* :)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S was natural, usually 2@Ss, less than 8|pg||
nt|roswolf: for once i understand their bidding:)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think W will try the @h and will delay @d till the end|pg||
pc|cK|nt|glen: 3@H was the big hand, natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c either nat or any strong hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: according to the CC|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: then 3@H= strong hand with @s+@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: impressive bidding|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dburn: good bid, that|pg||
nt|3for3: well done ew|pg||
nt|dburn: still, even if West had only bid five, East might have bid six|pg||
nt|andyv:  may lead @ss twice to hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now @s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: exactly|pg||
nt|andyv:  even dbl dummy can't see a way to strip the hand and throw S in to break the @d suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: i didnt expect this contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: should go -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you bid 1NT as W over 1@D?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: no i wouldnt|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm maybe that is a xfer too|pg||
nt|3for3: aha.  the save is found.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcomyn: h lkead d switch and another h but who would find that|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a natural raise you mean bill:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: "only" -5?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jfaria:  that doesnt solve the problem, but maybe  a favourable ending can be reached better that 50% chance after @h fails|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy can' take the @h hook|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: only four, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh only 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: cheap!|pg||
nt|3for3: 8 easy aces|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S must not try a @d now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club exit|pg||
nt|andyv:  he has 2 easy exits so no need to rush @d|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: it's good to see people raising clubs|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't happen often :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes of course they play transfers over 1@C -doh:(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh no|pg||
nt|andyv:  but what do I know|pg||
nt|jfaria:  MUST NOT :(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why do that with 2 easy options|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now there is a psic warfare|pg||
nt|andyv:  now West has to think since S wasn't being forced to lead @d that he may be underleading his Ace. |pg||
nt|jfaria:  Should accept the gift and let run to J?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think it's a gift|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: and bocchi-Madala found that defence in open room|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but could s be underleading the ace - unlikely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  as the cards lie it is|pg||
pc|d2|nt|woozle: Fiona decided that spades aren't promising on lead, so tries a surprise attack in clubs. Pepsi is surprised, but not so surprised that he will forget to take his now ten top tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ntmon: well deserved|pg||
nt|jcomyn: led d first and then h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very good but i wont lead a s whatever else|pg||

nt|blum1956: If North opens a strong 1NT, what will West bid&|pg||
nt|blum1956: ?|pg||
nt|woozle: North much too strong for a strong notrump...although at favourable I might open 2NT|pg||
nt|woozle: A strong notrump is the second best preempt in bridge, after 2NT|pg||
nt|woozle: Is Pepsi deep in the tank, or is this a coffee break?|pg||
nt|blum1956: This time 1@c is the worst option for North - East may even preempt in @s s wich solves the problem for EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 4@D would be a splinter we assume|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not want to do that with a singleton ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will brush the intervention aside|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be carnage|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mahaffey has dropped to 6th|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d one major|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D the other?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: 3@D will be a spade raise anyway; presumably 3@C would be hearts|pg||

nt|roswolf: they will play in 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: the auction in the other room was ultimately a phantom|pg||
nt|dburn: Cullin lurking|pg||
nt|andyv:  but dblton in @s may slow him down|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and can add toit here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c would be invite + in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has sufficient defence|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just that he has nothing to say|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting problem for W|pg||
mb|4C|nt|woozle: Fiona, bids the routine (at this vul) 2S|pg||
nt|roswolf: to the limit for west|pg||
nt|andyv:  most prudent is 4@c|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he has got the "expected"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: well predicted!|pg||
nt|roswolf: west must make his own arrangements|pg||
nt|andyv:  enterprising is 4@h|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@c looks ok to me|pg||
mb|5C|nt|woozle: McGann takes the quick path to game|pg||
nt|roswolf: good judgment|pg||
nt|athene: does bocchi have to find the diamond lead for 500 here?|pg||
nt|dburn: trying to look like a man saving in 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe this is a hand t show invite + in @H and when d bids @H bid @s to show both majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: the noose tightens|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he has no 4 cards in any other suit than @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: some superbergen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm ok this looks as though bocchi made a forcing pass and now a slam try in spades which is surely a bit optimistic with his hand|pg||

nt|hedyg: oy vey!|pg||
nt|roswolf: high noon shoot out|pg||
nt|glen: sementa rips up cards and leaves table|pg||

nt|hedyg: why XX?|pg||
nt|glen: actual it is xxxx since previous xx|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely if Sementa had a better suit he would have bid it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now dbl?|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth has seen his sort before, though|pg||
nt|3for3: well, his hand suggests bidding too |pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= 14-16|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is an upgrade|pg||
nt|roswolf: or 13 actually:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual in your singleton|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: jaki wynik , wyniki w necie nie dzialaja |pg||
nt|andyv:  with 5 losers, it's too much to ask for a passed hand to cover 3 of them|pg||

pc|hA|nt|roswolf: will n/s run out of red cards|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcomyn: but very difficult|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: passssssssssssssss|pg||

nt|roswolf: might give preference|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh well 2 imps to the swedes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: cannot be a forcing pass opposite what might be just invite|pg||
nt|glen: i still think ripping up cards will result in lowest possible minus score|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 8 card fit is better than nothing|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh no !|pg||

nt|hedyg: are we watching the right board?|pg||
nt|glen: now there are fires, and there is this|pg||

nt|roswolf: you shouldnt laugh at a funeral|pg||

nt|hedyg: next time i play in my cuebid i must try to remember this moment|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italian will be x -rated in the post mortem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like hand from the menagerie where both sides can play 2@dX|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: low trump to start|pg||
nt|granguru:  diagnostic?|pg||
nt|glen: the best thing for NS to do after the hand is leave table, then come back when decibel level is below 120|pg||
nt|hedyg: call an ambulance|pg||
nt|granguru:  --4?|pg||
nt|roswolf: gib says -7 dd|pg||

nt|roswolf: take|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is only when Madala doubles that he is better than invite|pg||
nt|3for3: a little chancy for cullin to double.  is meck is 0-2 in the blacks, might be cold, or his side could be making.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: just dont play @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@H was discouraging|pg||
nt|hedyg: in this situation it just denies the ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: seemed easier to disc 10@D|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|hedyg: if the 3@D bid had been gf, then it would have been a forcing pass|pg||
nt|athene: it's reasonable enough to play pass forcing if you showed at least game invite values and opps go to 5-level; 99% of the time they are advance saccing|pg||

nt|athene: if west just holds up his @SA isn't he beating 5@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is, needs to hold up twice|pg||
nt|athene: he ducks twice - now if bocchi plays another trump he takes the ace and plays a fourth and the club ruff goes|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called , Ginossar think 5s was -1 |pg||
nt|athene: if bocchi ruffs a club himself, then west can simply force the south hand in clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: Tadeusz, did Gino duck the A@S?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe bocchi claimed 11 or something and west agreed without really thinking it through|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely though|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but fatigue does play its part|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that unlikely, only 4-0 @ss could beat him|pg||

mb|3N|nt|dburn: may not be so easy to stay low enough - that 1@s might turn out to waste space rather than save it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 1@D for me too|pg||
nt|3for3: it often does|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it seems that West can use relays of some kind, rather than have the auction start 1@s-2@h-3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: living thru this at the table is bad, but worse will come during scoring when you say minus 1400 |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt much superior|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c gf relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: but no difficulty bidding game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT= 8-10 ZZ with a singleton|pg||
nt|3for3: how do you find 6@D opposite Q@S, A@H, a @D honor and A@C?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they wont gey overboard either|pg||
nt|hedyg: ZZ points..|pg||
nt|3for3: or even less with better diamond fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: A=3, K=2 and Q=1|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: McGann has been there before - the big preempt putting pressure on NS in exchange for losing an occasional miracle slam|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s on the previous bd are playing in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: IN THE OTHER ROOM|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @h lead, N can get 3 @h tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcomyn: lots of controls in n hand why not 2nt|pg||
nt|dburn: but an initial 1@d would not have shown diamonds, and if East can show what he has by responding to relays, 1@s may lead to an easier auction all round|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c relay|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|woozle: Pepsi chooses to go quietly with his 17-count, fearing that a double will be pulled too often|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice judgment here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well it must be makable since NS took 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is dangerous|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it looks dangerous, but they probably have it under control|pg||
nt|3for3: this is one of the things that makes bridge hard to 'sell' to the general public.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w will need a lot of the captain's coffee at the end of this match she wont be very sympathetic|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think W may be squeezed on the reds|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: "please continue to play, i will give you my decision"|pg||
nt|3for3: Even expert commentators have no clue what is happening|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|woozle: If the match were closer, he probably would have acted|pg||
nt|blum1956: This is a partscore board besides McGann has another opinion))|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS play negative frre bids (NFB) after intervention, so S has extras and N accepts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree but prefer playing from n|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@C showing short?|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about @H?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am sure there is no bid to show both singletons|pg||
nt|dburn: I expect that by now West knows what East has|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@C was probably 5161 with a stiff DUECE of hearts :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|granguru:  Duboin should have passed 1@H doubled but I give sementa the greatest part of guilt.for not passing 2@C.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Swedish experts think he showed exact pattern, thus wasted hcps in W hand|pg||
nt|dburn: people don't spend months and years devising these methods just to make life difficult for the commentators|pg||
nt|dburn: they do it because it helps them reach more right contracts than wrong ones|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but that would require a perfect dd play by N I think|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: h lead from w would n ot be nice|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lot of messages from specs about the last board|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree with that 1@HX probably not too bad|pg||
nt|granguru:  although 2@C is probably -4 |pg||
nt|glen: would make a fun "you be the judge" in the "the bridge world"|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|ntmon: sure, @H better for defence but again .. not easy|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: anyone know the ages of the dutch juniors|pg||

nt|roswolf: i bet the score stands though - if the claim was accepted even though in error - thats it unless it was impossible to win the number of tricks claimed|pg||
nt|roswolf: which it clearly wasnt|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not so sure - declarer is meant to give a line of play|pg||
nt|granguru:  :$|pg||

pc|h8|pc|s7|pc|hQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: 5@d went down|pg||
nt|glen: on some layouts where opener has both minor aces and the @Hs split 4-2 or 3-3, 3NT will have play on this board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 16 imps to kamras|pg||
nt|roswolf: but to be fair this is a very RARE mistake by these guys and they have plenty of imps in the bank from similar errors from past opps|pg||
nt|granguru:  REDOULBLE  on 1@Hx meant 3-suiter short in @D. So Sementa forgot or misunderstood..|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I was thinking about 12 tricks, now they r there to take , no squeeze needed, just dd|pg||

mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have 1@HX at -2 and -3 and 2@c X is -3|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: thus it was a close call to pass 2@H, but that got +110|pg||
nt|hedyg: John surely 1@D X already meant that?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: solid 2nt for m,e|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= 16+|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Lev and Pepsi reached the right contract with only one artificial bid, but the number of ways to skin a cat remains greater than one|pg||
nt|3for3: dbl=points, 5-8 or so.  not 'negative'|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: some will preemt with N hand|pg||
nt|athene: interesting - no Ghestem for this NS pair|pg||
nt|athene: but most italian pairs do play some sort of ghestem|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the E hand you bid X and pray pd doesnt bid 3@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well most of the time..could have been  a GOSH or a 2-suited hand also|pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: Now a notrump partscore, probably with an overtrick or two|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 4@H more normal although may double|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Probably best described as a Joey Silver hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: another "void hand"|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2@s was probably nonforcing|pg||

mb|3N|nt|hedyg: sry Murat|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kamras really doesnt want to play in @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  more tempted to open N hand 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: the @h position is of that special sort so nothing may disturb this contract|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S possible with such a good suit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: action again|pg||
nt|3for3: Rodwell's 4@S a coincidence.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and chosen|pg||
nt|hedyg: they do play Ghestem on their CC|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes partner has good diamonds and weak hearts and you can make 4@S but not 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: just maybe not with @cs|pg||
nt|athene: throwing hearts on diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  the spot cards are awful|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: what now - dicey|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this wont go for 1400 but in context a similar result|pg||
nt|granguru:  well -16 is not the worst we have seen|pg||
nt|hedyg: any reason his pd could not have 7 good @hs and void in @s?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4 baldy aces not your best holding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and note no other card higher than 7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: no hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: he does have the good 7 card suit part|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4h was a bit exaggerated for my taste|pg||

nt|jfaria:  Q@s|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|jfaria:  was misguided by 5@s answer, but Cohler rightly "showed" the @sQ|pg||

nt|andyv:  so 4@c was either a splinter, in which case 4N doesn't make sense or 4@c was RKC in which case 4N doesn't make any sense|pg||
