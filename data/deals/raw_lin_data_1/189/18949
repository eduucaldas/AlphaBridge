mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT - easy to make, but to bid it - I doubt...|pg||

nt|pelu: Hi all wellcome to the first KO-match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H looks ok for e/w   but can beaten if defence finds 2 diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D  makes if getting heart right|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 4@s or 5@c playable|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  do well in spades in spite of 4-1 split|pg||
nt|ady: sorry of course 3 losers in diamonds for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If 2 @D is a weak-2 - itÂ´s awful|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 5@H here would be a great sucess for E-W unless  N-s finds an impossible @D ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: E: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=7668|pg||
nt|pelu: to make 4@S decl has to duck @s 2x, but as u see 5@H close to make - only defense: @DA and small @S to Q - almost impossible to find|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: Geoffrey, Vlad, and specs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: hmm nrway strikes first|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Geo|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: 4@D seems to have stolen the hand|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I would not open 2H with 4 cards in the other major in 2nd hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And so much values in minors|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 4cl by East,now all Forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: the X is the clue to S to find the winning plan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: good board for australia if they make this it will be ahugh bonus not very tuff|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @C ace is off hence let it be doubleon then|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sorry very sorry|pg||
nt|suketbombi: South Africa was dreaming:):)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 420 is par, use entries for spade finesses|pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to finess in @s immediately|pg||
nt|ady: not the way to beat 4@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jr7: Hi all - no names, but we are playing|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jbgood: and the trump lead doesnt hurt declarer much|pg||
nt|alok_daga: hope bidding 6 does not go unpunished as a flat brd|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Fantoni,Nunes miss this cold grand?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|geot: Duboins double was of course a reasonable choice, but no success here|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bit too pushy by west although 5@D would not be a success either|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: are these the right teams/names?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ace of @H and a @h will be a deception for North|pg||
nt|xenya: this will be painful for Lavazza|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: hi CK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rmb1: North needed to make more of his club suit in the auction|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davpro: Well done|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|alok_daga: this 7 ,playing teams by any standard shud br a push.F&N will be v upset I am sure|pg||
nt|davpro: true|pg||
nt|suketbombi: too fast|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S x in OR hare S only open 1@S and EW could easy fins the @H-fit and bid on to 5@h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: there is more though, some chance of a squeeze for 5|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: they will need some expresso's|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|geot: West wanted to cater for partner having some nice spades behind and not commit his own partnership to the 5 level |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: only a mistake in the defence can give 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|jbgood: 3rd and 5th |pg||
nt|rv: declarer needs to play low @c from dummy as well as play @h to !Q and duck @h to possibly make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jbgood: some work to be done for sure - but I think he finds it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rv: start with @d duck, win second @d in dummy and play low @c out, he can score the contract|pg||

nt|hawe45:  How to bid 3 NT - I see no way to that contract|pg||
nt|cenglund:  There is a risk to end up in 4 hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They probably open 1H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It would have more idea to open THIS West-hand with 2 @D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  It was a disaster for the South Africans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but I wouldÂ´nt do it|pg||
nt|pelu: I 100% agree with Apteker to open 4@s|pg||
nt|suketbombi: would have played @S T to queen in an unlikely event @S 9 drops singleton and @DK is doubleton then think about @CS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Patrick|pg||
nt|patricck: Hi everyone :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|pelu: another wild board|pg||
nt|roswolf: new leaders|pg||
nt|xenya: hello CK|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  down 2 in open room   11 imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hans , Christer , Specs good afternoon to all |pg||
nt|geot: An unusual 17 imps against a team of such a standard|pg||
nt|xenya: who is to blame on that deal?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: but - at least in teams - declarer should have played @sA and @s10 before the last trumph. a good player can duck @sJ|pg||
nt|geot: West could certainly have bid 4NT, two places to play (minors at first)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Meck opened 1D with the puny collection of high cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The problem is: You take these two first West-hands and compare. There is TOO much fifference - so partner never will know, what you have, when you open 2 @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@D opener , with diferent type of hands|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1sp 1nt 2hrts,2spades then?|pg||
nt|patricck: A nice start for the Apteker team as EW pushed the Open room pair one level higher|pg||
nt|roswolf: double game + swing|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: double by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  As predicted!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Hi all|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S play either straight forward 2/1 or transfer after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: N opened 3 @c and E made a nonleaping Michaels 4@d, so 4@h was wrongsided and got a @d lead|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT by South is not bad with spade lead from King|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes @H + @D behave well|pg||
nt|rmb1: Meanwhile South could X or bid NT now|pg||
nt|ady: not wild about 2@S from east|pg||
nt|jbgood: 500 in 2@s x - but that will not happen|pg||
nt|mamos: don't know geoffrey|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only + = both hands had the 10 of @S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 11 fast reicks for N-S  in minor |pg||
nt|cenglund:  True, but I am sure they would have opened 1H, but Meck did not allow that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that a @S-shift will kill 5 @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so fast... - these 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the 11 trick of @D can be a problem in this hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt will be reached quickly here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|kirp:  S takes ull by the horns|pg||
nt|kirp:  bull not ull|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Nice bid by South!|pg||
nt|pelu: when the X show the black suits what is 2@C then?|pg||
nt|patricck: East has taken away North's main suit|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: ah they change|pg||
nt|suketbombi: wnats to get his @S in to picture early and bid @Cs to hilt but his party is spoiled by the 2@C bid East|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and now 3 NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi mike|pg||
nt|mamos: Mahaffey EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least this will be fast:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead is obligatory, otherwise 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C just tell: be carefull N - bad distribution - |pg||
nt|pelu: N dont belive :)|pg||
nt|patricck: Now there is partnership confidence, having no doubts about partner misinterpreting the bid|pg||
nt|pelu: will S bid 3@S or give up?|pg||
nt|patricck: South is sitting there waiting for a power cut I think.....bet he doesn't feel happy about the auction|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: you might have seen me playing with Olsen on BBO, his nick is James950|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's actually a regular on BBO |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nowhere else to go?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5@c also good|pg||
nt|pelu: would u in S place :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: now N sh accept - his partner passed over 2@c|pg||
nt|geot: South just delay the 3NT bid here, cant really see why she did not bid 3NT over 1S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: is club ace realistic lead|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S North?|pg||
nt|patricck: best defence is to lead @D, A@H and another might lead to a lucky 10 tricks when the K@S falls after East has ruffed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @DS is the best Start for defence |pg||
nt|pelu: samme bidding to 3@C in OR, but here S passed|pg||
nt|pelu: Piekarek like to X|pg||
nt|patricck: no reason to double here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No @S-lead also OK naturally|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N i may be Geoffrey, but certainly not quickly|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jameslee 2: K@S lead |pg||
nt|xenya: and not 3N... |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 4@H will be more interesting|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 4@h:) at least on a spade lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice lead :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: or duck of heart lead now|pg||
nt|pelu: best attack - now prob down more that 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a clear duck! If declarer has @hAjxxx why not finess?|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the OR made a helptry thru a 3dmnds,here more logical,end result,same.Diff 2 bid|pg||
nt|xenya: what's going on here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S on a moysian fit is unexpected|pg||
nt|psyck: S got herself worried of the @d unneccesarily|pg||
nt|geot: Hm...........as ex-Norwegian I am not to happy about this auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C on a moysian is crazy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: i think it is, this play only makes sense if south has heart ace|pg||
nt|geot: 25 HCPs and two balanced hands, seems to "clever" to do something like this|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like 3N would have come home with say a loser in each suit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jameslee 2: bad luck to see 11 and not make them |pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: imps back to the coffee drinkers i fancy:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|patricck: best not to cover|pg||
nt|suketbombi: normaly u lead doubleton to get ruff here it is to shorten the big hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbgood: perhaps N might have tried 3@s over 3 @h?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: yes jack was a mistake|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad luck for declarer|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: thats it |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he is the one that can see them not the others |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now -2 for 3 IMPÂ´s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - if he tries to make it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  This would be wrong with 3 @C together with 4 @D|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Spade 10 prevent declarer from squeezing East|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other room 5@C -1|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 x 16 in the finals on Wednesday|pg||
nt|patricck: pitch a @C from dummy might be best|pg||
nt|patricck: 28 board matches are of course cutthroat, the best team often wins but the match is short enough to give the underdog a fighting chance|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he is likely to ruff  and play the @CT|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff, take @SA and play @C and West is ensplayed|pg||
nt|pelu: bridge is so easy when u see all 52 cards :)|pg||
nt|patricck: We've been seeing the same cards for quite a while now.........   hopefully we will see some action soon|pg||
nt|psyck: likely no more tricks in @c than in NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: what are the best chances? enter dummy on @sA and play a small @h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: small heart from hand trick 2 looks fine|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cenglund:  Mahaffey may discard a spade and then declarer will prevail|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|alok_daga: clubs,33,hrts 33,Spade K inside ,nv brd not wrth the risk|pg||
nt|geot: and the contract is two levels higher|pg||
pc|h8|nt|suketbombi: sure but he knows 2/1/5/5 with east|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|cenglund:  Now it's -1|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: upps |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rmb1: @C finesse and @H finesse|pg||
nt|ady: re hi all   got disconnected|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not missed much - declarer edging his way towards his contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West has a weak-2 - and East will keep the @HÂ´s|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: see they chose the 4-3 heart fit     looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: but expertly played by N|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|rmb1: More effective auction in OR|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up the hearts   but clubs blocked  so will hav e to lose 1 more|pg||
nt|jbgood: 11 for at push|pg||
nt|patricck: A@S and Q@S is good enough to make|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jameslee 2: 5@C =|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pelu: now its East who is endplayed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes |pg||
nt|patricck: well, a small diamond lead declarer needs to finesse the 9, tricky|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N in other room should come home if dec plays for @s 33 with 3@s, 1@h, 2@d, 3@c|pg||
nt|xenya: now another trump |pg||
pc|h7|nt|suketbombi: he has all the count tho|pg||

nt|roswolf: meckwell in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bridge is an easy game - defense not!|pg||
nt|cenglund:  He will establish a spade trick now|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big swing 12 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: miss fit for N-S reds againts -blacks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: part score lets see where|pg||
nt|roswolf: the roof fell in|pg||
nt|xenya: small slip at the end for an extra undertrick|pg||
nt|roswolf: more bite here|pg||
nt|psyck: anyway, imps to the coffee promoters will make the match closer & more exciting for us|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cenglund:  You could not imagine that he scored a trick in a side suit missing KQJ10|pg||
nt|pelu: a very nice board|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kirp:  Precision @C by W|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S can make 3@h and E/W can make 3@d, but need accurate play to make 3@H I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed mike -straightforward bd|pg||
nt|psyck: oh, 3N did not make after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: The OR (Open Room) in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  3@H looks ambitious on 43|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@d was suction|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @H or @s and @c|pg||
nt|rmb1: According to their card, South could open 1NT,  not sure why he didn't|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and perhaps a share in the complimentary drink -p&p to the UK is the bore though:(|pg||
mb|d|nt|oosmanb: 3@D probably for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@h might be tricky|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 17 facing 14,a slam for the taking as cards fit.Doubt whether it will be bid|pg||
nt|fann4: E made a try and then stopped (he was facing a weak NT opening)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this 2@D is a new species, at least for me|pg||
nt|kirp:  curious to see how high EW get now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nobody will agree - but life is fantastic. if you open he North hand with 1 @C|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fann4: Similar situation now - not easy for E to drive to slam, though he has 7 controls, a doubleton and some good @D|pg||
nt|psyck: declarer played @h too early, before setting up @c's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 2@s on the way to 3@d?|pg||
nt|ady: bad diamond split may beat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt!?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other table meck made the 2@H with the sing 8@C lead |pg||
nt|roswolf: still 3 imps to the italians|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: but here bidding to finishe |pg||
nt|cenglund:  Multi is a dangerous gadget - for both sides|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S: I confirm my 5-card-suit...|pg||
nt|pelu: a veru poor opening, can NS stop in time?|pg||
nt|patricck: might be a thin opening, but it would have been a chunky pass :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: agree peter|pg||
nt|pelu: Qx 2x are not good vcalues|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  E showed 5-7 hcp, so no strain on raise to 3@D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this just needs @C Ace onside, (or Ax @S?)|pg||
nt|alok_daga: wud rank F&N as 1 of the best in business they not having a gud day in office|pg||
nt|pelu: and the opening suit not better|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Loose one @D and ruff one, could be just one @D loser|pg||
nt|jbgood: he may lose to the king and ruff one - that would give 10|pg||
nt|ady: yes    will have to take care|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks certain|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume the 1@S bid denied 4@H|pg||
nt|fann4: Only 11 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the nt game playing IMPS is ridiculous|pg||
nt|patricck: sure, but the 10@D is a useful filler, I am not saying it is a clear opening, just that it is close to the borderline|pg||
nt|roswolf: alet off for norway|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: sry Robin - not a deliberate copy:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this auction is very restrained|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: indded, N managed to describe his hand at a low level|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: Yes.  Not always true that 3 losers is 10 winners|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: now hw has confirm the 5@C also :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - at the 3-level...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos:  So Diamonds are 3-3 and soon declarer wil smile|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that the odds are on north only having 3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|STRIK3R: will find the A of @c and @s after 1@d, since 1@h was a freely bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: this looks very good for NS, all games down and lots of values|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks on any lead, so a nice stop|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer does have entry problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but i fancy this making|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jameslee 2: not and easy spot to make 9 lets she what can happend |pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: no problem in opening on 11, but u sh have a good suit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oosmanb: actually maybe it also needs A@S onside or @D 2-2, so you can get to 2nd @c trick|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: looks to bwe going about it the right way|pg||
nt|mamos: or communication problems is a better way of expressing it|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9@C coming back |pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: should overtake and play a spade|pg||
pc|hA|nt|suketbombi: agree also the number of Cards in Major are relevant when u open light|pg||
nt|patricck: I would agree it would be a horrible opening if the @D were J7532, but with J10852 I would not condemn my partner if they chose to open|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jameslee 2: j@D can come from N |pg||
nt|pelu: 7 tricks: @DAK, @c to Q and @Dj|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos: yeah we know it's ok  he does not|pg||
nt|roswolf: now declarer just needs to cash tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: The home team's true name now is KONSTANTA. We had input the name SKWARK due to some minor discrepancies in the matchup. We apologize for any inconvenience.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|pelu: in Op S passed over 1@S, and now EW in 2@Sx|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can make 2@H/2@D/4@C not easy to make the 9th trick |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|rmb1: Made it look easy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm  it is difficult for declarer to be confident that he has the tricks he needs|pg||
nt|roswolf: cash and hope|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|h2|nt|STRIK3R: North endplayed|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Meckwell had a disaster in the OR|pg||
nt|fann4: Alok, I think your criticism is a bit strong - East knows they have 29-31 points between, so how risky is 3NT? I'd say virtually not at all.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Easy defense against 6 @D |pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of points but not enough for a slam|pg||
mb|2N|nt|STRIK3R: can make 3NT as the cards lay|pg||
nt|oosmanb: no stopping now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if guessing right in @h's|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@H   but fortunate |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Can make 4@H if there is only 1 @H loser|pg||
nt|psyck: more or less on a finesse, likely will be bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: hardly recommended but brown would have done well to balance with double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will hav e to drop honor doubleton heart in north hand   and bring in 5 club tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: X from East?  4@C seems too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: @S partial|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean: 6 @S|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the fact that the spade suit does not cum into the frame,I found objectionable|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  14-16 hcp, 3@C is simple Stayman|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Yes, because there is not way of pitching the losing diamonds|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@C = singleton @C not in the goos spot for N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @H...|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Meck hates to bid bad slams, but he did not follow his principle on this one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very dificult not to bid 6@H here |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cue-bids might be invented these days|pg||
nt|cenglund:  RKCB is not the answer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but on info controls could be a good stop from N-S lets see |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South has bad values in the side-suits|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he could bid it directly or not |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: long think |pg||
nt|cenglund:  I suppose 3C shows minimum|pg||
nt|fann4: Slam is on here for NS, but the @SKQx opposite shortage looks wasted to South.|pg||
nt|fann4: This can go for 800 in 4@Sx|pg||
nt|fann4: Note E did not enter the auction in the OR|pg||
nt|alok_daga: but AQ10xx,shud appeal when partner splinters|pg||
nt|fann4: NS are clearly in a forcing situation, so S may pass.|pg||
nt|fann4: In which case N will likely press on.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Pass?his strength yet undisclosed|pg||
nt|fann4: S hates @SKQx for offense, but dbl may be a little premature|pg||
nt|fann4: Alok, 3@S is a splinter, forcing to game.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 1hrt may be 6,he has 14|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Hi|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi and welcome Pekka|pg||
nt|patricck: should be a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Dbl =?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: flat board here 1@H & 2@CS to loose|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C would make on a good day|pg||
nt|psyck: 4333 & max 32 hcp, so E took the low road|pg||
nt|roswolf: but no enterprise from the italians|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  This was the solution - now 4 @H and thatÂ´s it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Now he cant cue bid 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If he does, he might make the slam...!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: let,s see if S can help N to bid the good contract |pg||
nt|pelu: the runnings scores are yet not running, but I am sure that the polish IT-staff is working hard|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: stole it|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club switch now|pg||
nt|mamos: South squeezed out of auction|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Provided that 4C was not a query of some kind|pg||
nt|bagman: If memory servers; greco hampson play meckwell type precision where North was limited|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. Either a @d lead or continue with @s|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @c lead ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not easy to pick that contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kirp:  3N is fairly lucky to make, 3@C could be 5 CMS looking at 3@S bid to show 4@Hs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can he play on @C instead of @H ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  W showed @S if any 4 crd major, so @S lead is not best usually|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cenglund:  They are heading for same destination|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there they go to 6@H|pg||
nt|pelu: there could come 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kirp:  may play on @Hs |pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hate to - but have to! - syt it: POOR BIDDING AT BOTH TABLES|pg||
nt|hawe45:  say it|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I don't think that this slam is unavoidable|pg||
nt|pelu: no more|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: i want to bid|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this is what happened!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kirp:  small @H best now, but @D finesse works|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: considering his middelcards in @c, playing one round on @h's was more attempting, needed to try @c's if first @h failed?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Team Angelini picked up more imps in board 2 when the other room bid 3NT instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|kirp:  ad hope NY couldn't take 3@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: a fair punt, but didnt work out|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes, I guess J@H onside is higher %age than @C 3-3? |pg||
nt|kirp:  3@S lead certainly gave defense little chance to figure out what to do|pg||
nt|kirp:  if @H J is onside, then has time to test @Cs and if not 33, then @Ds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D finesse|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt he need @d finesse in any case? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  They are "buried" in their conventions!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes, I think they play a lot of Meckwell stuff.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 tricks look the max|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cenglund:  Both N-S pairs thought that it's a big minus|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|jbgood: needed to safety play diamonds to win|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: likely not much difference here since NS on for 4@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  still only 8 trix with J@H onside|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to get 3@d tricks, so @d finesse is very much needed|pg||
nt|kirp:  S should have continued @Hs ,then needed @D finesse|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|jameslee 2: we,ll after all (no score)  we shall keep 12-12|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: now has to drop doubleton A@S eith east    play towards K@S    then drop ace 2nd round|pg||
nt|jbgood: still 1 down may be cheap|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kirp:  another pickup for EW, as they played 1N in OR|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A pleasent surprise is waiting for them|pg||
nt|psyck: tuf to find minor 44 fit after 2N opening & 6NT is not a good slam unlike 6@c, so sensible by E to not try I suppose|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: reviewed board 1, N/S play transfer after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@S is a sporting contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here you must insist on two @S-losers NOT to make 4 @S|pg||
nt|alok_daga: with Qx,Jxx what does he cue?|pg||
nt|roswolf: only 10 5ricks made in the other room -an imp closer|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H  was bid and made in OR   so poor result for Netherlands|pg||

mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: 4nt?|pg||

nt|jbgood: a direct 3 NT or via 3@h?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not bridge:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont like double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 1@s from north show 3-5 @s's they open 1@c with weak hands with 5-5 in @c and @s|pg||
nt|patricck: or 8 tricks sacrificing in spades, same score|pg||
nt|roswolf: some e/w partscore now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: transfers first|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  2@S can buy the hand now|pg||

pc|d4|nt|fann4: 1 off on the bad trump break.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: where does the 8th trick cum from?5hrts+2 dmnds|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to play the @DJ from dummy after winning @HK hoping to be able to get a spade or a diamond later|pg||
nt|fann4: There is no 8th trick - he will lose 3@C tricks.|pg||
nt|fann4: Now that he is going to be deprived of a @C ruff he should probably win in hand and play a @S up to the K|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: W is very happy now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@s confirm the 5th @s|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: not much comunication for the 2 @S finesse required |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C play could duck by S |pg||
nt|bagman: East needs to play a spade in some point to prevent @S-@D strip squeeze; if the defense cashes their 4 tricks and fail to play a spade, W is strip squeezed|pg||
nt|fann4: And easy to see - losing 1 trump, 1@S, 3@C and @DK|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks horrible|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed game on|pg||

pc|s6|nt|bagman: Having cashed the spade, the defense should take the clubs and lock declarer to his hand|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what can E play for now ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Kx@S ?|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: has to decide how to move the @S |pg||

pc|hJ|nt|cenglund:  Excellent score for the team Apteker|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: this is Bridge when one has a few options can go rong :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both of them (East and West) might have bid better. East has no hand for NT-play, and West never showed the 6th @S|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They bid the more sensible 4S in the OR making|pg||
nt|fann4: The defence would have to mess this up really badly to end play themselves.|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: yes absolutly true |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 10 |pg||
nt|bagman: West should have discard the @SA because the !Q was not covered so E had the @SJ left|pg||
nt|bagman: @SQ|pg||
nt|alok_daga: a likely push,|pg||
nt|patricck: It couldn't be @D, you can see those in dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: 12 IMP after mistake in defense and then in play|pg||
nt|roswolf: that will cost|pg||
nt|roswolf: a tempter for n/s|pg||
nt|psyck: they got to a strange contract other room last deal, likely the bidding was not completely entered|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Suppose West opens 1 @H - would 5 @D be the bid?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The level of bridge seen so far has been rather poor and not what we had expected|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: has 4@H could wait |pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbgood: so 3 teams go to the A Swiss and the others to B. Then 27 from A and 5 from B go to the KO rounds|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: no carry overs|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H  about the limit for n/s|pg||
nt|rmb1: Might try 4@S would make if @SKx onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Fun hand now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At the other table only 3 @D - too friendly|pg||
nt|fann4: They could miss it now|pg||
nt|fann4: But vul N must be tempted to do something.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kirp:  3@H by NS should be the limit, not successfully either|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda6.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: muiderberg it looks like|pg||
nt|mamos: lightning pace at this table|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@S same spot |pg||
nt|alok_daga: now the excitement starts with a unnatural 2hrts|pg||
nt|fann4: Shows you!|pg||
nt|fann4: 2@H wasn't unnatural - it was a weak 2.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|oosmanb: Well North's initial pass|pg||
nt|oosmanb: has put an upper limit I think|pg||
nt|kirp:  gives W a problem, tho' strong@C system helps|pg||
nt|kirp:  W knows NS have 8+@Hs ,|pg||
nt|fann4: Maybe not everyone's choice, with A109xxx.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the @H duck was strang apparently happened on other tables too|pg||
nt|pelu: but again easy for us|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes    the hand belongs to e/w    but 9 tricks the limit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|STRIK3R: 8@hs I would say, x from east should show 4@h?|pg||
nt|kirp:  2N is some form of Lebensohl, compete in a minor|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yes seems like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  but not as clear in this sequence|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult call here|pg||
nt|mamos: East's hand seems enormous for this treatment but what do I know|pg||
nt|roswolf: mild slam try showing short spades no doubt|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|fabsayc: lead critical|pg||
nt|ady: n/s well overboard|pg||
nt|psyck: S making a slam try showing the @h suit & @s shortness, N will signoff with balanced minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: no diamond lead makes south huge favorite to hold spade queen|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@S on the K@C placed|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kirp:  good stop|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: indeed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a passive defence here is in order  @D being frozen suit|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 4 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Its only -1 |pg||
nt|roswolf: and a club switch to follow|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: spec gives me a 6@D cool contract comment |pg||
nt|bagman: In the 2nd position the preempt should be quite pure as there's sort of 50-50 chance that the good cards are held by the partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: yes unless defence opens up @DS|pg||
nt|pelu: down 1 as long as NS dont play @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: north co-operates - this auction needs to slow down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 200 to Netherlands    could only make 140     east with defensive values  might have doubled 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And with 400 in 5 @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - East ducks the first @C for sure|pg||
nt|fann4: So 10 imps probably to DEN|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jameslee 2: true only 1 discard for the 4th @H not enough for 12 @D|pg||
nt|fann4: Who will have built up a good lead.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Marty Bergen says AQJ10xx&Jxxx of the OM 2 start a weak 2 here the suit also bad |pg||
nt|xenya: but even 4@H is too high on a @C lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but normal|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: maybe a little lucky that there was a Spade to cash|pg||
nt|roswolf: these top players dont go wrong in the play of these hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: a great result for mahaffey|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 now. 2@d 2@h and one trumph|pg||
nt|ady: may only be down 1    need to take club ruff|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A heart continuation would been fatal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But with some endplay-position, which makes|pg||
nt|cenglund:  No endplay any more, whatever is the shift|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|cenglund:  3 IMPs to Apteker|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: though if they take club ruff  then diamond trick goes|pg||
nt|ady: so down 1 it is|pg||
pc|c6|nt|suketbombi:  two rds of @C now and @H A and back:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now he did open up @DS|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H only need @H or @DA right - almost a 75%|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: so the 4@H bid saved an imp|pg||
nt|psyck: on a good day, N would have Axxx Axx Ajx QJx or something & 6@h would have play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kirp:  that settles for 3@D making|pg||
nt|roswolf: today is a bad day:(|pg||
nt|psyck: another swing unexpectedly with @dJ lead in OR same contract|pg||

nt|mamos: wild hand |pg||
nt|mamos: s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another IMP possible here for Apteker|pg||
nt|fann4: These days most experts prefer to open a weak 2 with a side 4 card major, if it's not too good a suit.|pg||
nt|pelu: what a gift|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes true + this defence if both wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: so 76% :) I will only give 1% for misdefense|pg||
nt|xenya: good try but a new leader|pg||
nt|roswolf: strange lead in the other room -so the lead changes hands again|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rmb1: Again EW might try 4@S|pg||
nt|fann4: But I far preferred the pass made at the other table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like 3N down on @s lead here, if it can be found|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is solid even though i suspect an upgrade from north|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Any endplays possible for 10th trick in 4@H? |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: I doubt it, so NS would do well to stop below game|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C was 16+ artificial|pg||
nt|fann4: Wow - a disaster for EW in the CR, ending up in 4@H in a 5-1 fit.|pg||
nt|geot: Only the mentioned spade lead is a problem|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: 61% for NS on board 6, nobody made 3@C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but with a 10 card fit, vulnerable, can Fjaelberg put the brakes on |pg||
nt|kirp:  4@H can make if W does not switch to @S when in with the A@C|pg||
pc|h8|nt|oosmanb: How? even if @C are stripped East has 4th @d to exit?|pg||
nt|kirp:  8@S|pg||
nt|patricck: more than 1% chance for a misdefence because it could be the opening lead that gives it away. After that has been survived very unlikely the defence will slip,|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will now power home|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, likely an upgrade with a decent 6 carder|pg||
pc|h7|nt|oosmanb: Ah right, |pg||
nt|jbgood: guess X shows 4-5+ spades?|pg||
nt|ady: down 1  would sedem unless a slip|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1C-P-1H = S so I guess this X is a transfer to S as well|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 4@h now|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A less interesting board |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Overtrick is easy: 2 x @H - and a SMALL @D|pg||
nt|xenya: the 1N opening seems to have worked well here|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Well spotted Martin|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: might get to 4 now|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Fantoni,Nunes reach a 4hrts on a 5 1 suit,miss their 5 3 fit,a off day for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: S could never hope to buy the contract in @hs - so perhaps xx in stead of 2 @h to indicate a high @h honor might have worked better|pg||
nt|cenglund:  That's what happened in the OR|pg||
pc|c5|nt|oosmanb: So yes important for West to break up endplay, and he will too, has 1@S bid to help him|pg||
nt|kirp:  I said 'can make', timing and defense needed to help|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: E knows that W has short hearts and might even hope a heart lead|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Assume pp 1sp p 2nt=4trumps+a stiff.AKx treated as a 4card in the OR|pg||
nt|fann4: In my book, the W hand is just a 2@S raise over 1@S|pg||
nt|bagman: Here declarer can cash the @HA and cross ruff 8 additional trump tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fann4: Can one make 10 tricks on the layout?|pg||
nt|bagman: GIB can but E's going to cash his easy 9 :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes|pg||
nt|psyck: W got his @s's into the bidding other room, so a swing likely|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  South can see 23 HCP - so not much for an entry in North|pg||

nt|geot: to late with the heart lead, declarer can set up 2 hearts and a total of nine|pg||
nt|roswolf: here a pretty fair slam |pg||
nt|psyck: he could, but he chose to play @c 1st for some reason, a Grosvenor :)|pg||
nt|geot: what is best here, 6D or 6H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos: 4 of a major here|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: after second club ducked north almost certainly should unblock diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So half of the teams play next round|pg||
nt|bagman: Even though the hearts are blocked there are only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|psyck: These Grosvenor Coups can really demoralize opps, but not these EW here I'm sure|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|STRIK3R: 1@d from south 4+@h|pg||
nt|rmb1: So much different seeing all four hands.  But North does not know about West's clubs or @HK in South|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  makes    just lose 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is how they open a bal strongish hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: 1NT from North, 0-2@h's|pg||
nt|rmb1: South has enough shape/points to insist on game|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|kirp:  does 1N deny 4@S?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: made 4@H on board 7 in open|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@H made in the other room, even though East was on lead and led @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I mean West was on lead|pg||
nt|mamos: the results service for this tourney is indeed the best ever http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orr7t31-1.htm  120 tables in play in the Open teams and every score  on the internet in a ...|pg||
nt|mamos: flash|pg||
nt|pelu: the 4@H - also misdefense in OR here S dusked to many @S , so 2 @D could go on @ss|pg||
nt|suketbombi: some of the matches close but Monaco has runaway with a 41-0 lead against the Indian Texans|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: they might play 3NT     might make with fortunate lay of club honors|pg||
nt|rmb1: X of 2@C even by passed hand, is a bit thin|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like a long auction coming up|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jbgood: transfer?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@H might be a transfer or smolen (5+S - 4 H)|pg||
nt|psyck: @h better I think, you can try various lines in @d depending on how it goes if @h were trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: I would not think of Smolen with 6 @s:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Just trying to get North to declare spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: but surely looks like it|pg||
nt|bagman: W has nothing to add here even though he can see that diamonds are likely to run|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rmb1: I thought East may double 4M based on West's earlier double.  But he has a different view of the hand|pg||
mb|4C|nt|oosmanb: East discarded a @d, and Nunes ruffed the 4th @D good|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: west thinking of attacking @c's?|pg||
nt|jbgood: is this true?|pg||
nt|rmb1: He may double 5M :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: and North is thinking ... ?|pg||
nt|jbgood: firs willing to play 4@h then 5 @s? Where is dicipline? (but N might have bid 3 NT with his double club stopper|pg||
nt|geot: the 18-20 2@D opening which will likely lead them to slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|rmb1: I think 3@H was misunderstood|pg||
nt|ady: crazy bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jbgood: No double:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: no trouble? :(|pg||
nt|ady: very good score for Netherlands  even undoubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: follow F&N on a regular basis.Dont recollect when they last had such a disastrous set|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense has 3 hearts and a club; declarer can ruff his 3rd club in dummy|pg||
nt|fann4: Claiming time in one second.|pg||
nt|fann4: At this stage it is 19-11 to DEN in vps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and it is almost impossible to find a reasonable line that fails on this layout|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jameslee 2: seems a flat board on a @C lead |pg||
nt|geot: As long as the hearts are so friendly he will be playing for an overtrick in 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: K/Q@C depends on style |pg||
mb|4N|nt|roswolf: 4nt now or a majestic leap to the final contract?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|roswolf: what are trumps?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|ady: think south should have taken the money when e/w got to the 5 level |pg||
nt|jbgood: A kib points out: Muller was afraid they would run to 6 sp :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: 1@D for E-W = for 11 |pg||
nt|roswolf: @H ok|pg||
nt|psyck: trump set as @h after the puppet response to 2N|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|psyck: E would not bid 4@c if he had @s instead of @h|pg||
nt|psyck: sry mean if he did not have @h support|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|xenya: if S is imaginative enough to lead the @D9,,,|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: N was punished after a - for me forbidden - lead from Jxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: board 8 spade lead is right at imps as best shot to beat hand, but more dubious at match points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: over 50% difference between +1 and +2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe the most important decision at mp is the opening lead, which is not given enough consideration|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: and 2 boards left |pg||
nt|psyck: if E was doubleton @h, he would likely have just bid 3N, so 4@c must be cue with @h|pg||

nt|xenya: how many times has the lead changed hands -- i seem to have lost count|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: but self inflicted and well deserved|pg||
nt|roswolf: 96 imps in 23 bds is a lot|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the other room W did not value his 55 well enough to go further|pg||
mb|d|nt|bagman: S probably showed AK bare by leading the @HK; on the @HK, N should signal as to normal Kx lead; when the @HA reveals the position, N should show suit preference how to get in|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be feisty|pg||
mb|2N|an| |mb|3S|nt|ady: 3NT play wrong way up|pg||
nt|jbgood: a good example why 3NT should be played by W|pg||
nt|fann4: It is in fact 20-10 right now|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@SX the final contract?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Facing a limited opening, Greco can pass|pg||
nt|fann4: Same pass in the other room|pg||
nt|fann4: A sensible auction in the OR|pg||
nt|bagman: They also play limited openings, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3NT denies outside A/K - but can be 2Q :)|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 4@S finishe |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: for a 11 flat score |pg||
nt|fann4: I'm not at all convinced about passing the S hand.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 2spades with hrt,5 3 enterprising|pg||
nt|bagman: If 3@H showed a minimum, E has nothing to add|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: yeah|pg||
nt|kirp:  even after a @H switch by S, one duck and S has no more entries|pg||
nt|oosmanb: too many stoppers in @s, no entry for @H, |pg||
nt|kirp:  however there are transport problems|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4 more IMPs to Angelini|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3rd seat 1@H seems like it might disrupt things a bit|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: was almost expecting Olsen to open 2@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I was half expecting a 1@H opening|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not sure if he and Jan open 2@H on 5 card suites|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: not a lucky contract, but I agree with Souths bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: east would have done better perhaps by immediately bidding 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jr7: I think they are trying to catch the play they are playing now!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I know many players, who would - as happened at the other table - have bid 2 @H over Wests 1 @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jameslee 2: last board could be a big swing to make the match closer |pg||
nt|fann4: This can easily go 2  down.|pg||
nt|bagman: EW are vulnerable, but I think that this is punishing partner for balancing|pg||
nt|fann4: E did far too much here.|pg||
nt|fann4: And suddenly ANG could pick up 8 or so imps|pg||
nt|alok_daga: &not a bad balance at that.1sp pp 2hrts can be worse|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ady: maybe some back for Aptekar|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kirp:  small @D towards J, now W has to hope Q@C dblton|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think there were problems with small @D to J too, then you dont have tempo for @C tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: as south will play another @S, before any @C played|pg||

nt|bagman: Before setting it 2 tricks you have to set it 1 trick first|pg||
nt|fann4: Agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: And if you have the setting trick in hand in a nondoubled vulnerable game, you quite often should cash it|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer needs to take a ruffing finesse in @C to get 8 tricks|pg||
nt|alok_daga: cash hrt Ace play spade |pg||
nt|geot: In the other room N/S was left in 4@H I hear, bad news for the Norwegians|pg||

nt|ady: well Aptekar got to 3NT in OR   surprising   so finishing a close match|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fann4: So a likely flat or 1imp board - meaning an excellent result for DEN, who are in 6th position in the A Swiss right now.|pg||
nt|alok_daga: GN all|pg||
nt|bagman: the trump lead was quite standard after the auction; with hearts 3-3 the spades go away for push|pg||
nt|fann4: Whereas ANG are 28th - remember the top 27 go thru, with 5 teams from the B Swiss, to the round of 32.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: club jack is going for another swindle|pg||
