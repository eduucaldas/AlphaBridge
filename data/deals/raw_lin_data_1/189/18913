mb|p|nt|hedyg: while the opps twiddle their thumbs?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jbgood: and she is|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: even 4@h would make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: mini NT is at least credible and Syayman looks OK so on track now|pg||
nt|runnerup: destany was 4 down some misfif and 10+10  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT from North will confirm all is well|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 3NT from South if 3D suggested diamonds + 4 spades|pg||
nt|rcerreto: this hand would be scary if playing "Gazzilli"|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@d more flexible?|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is scary anyhow|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 2@d denies 5+@hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: well, its a difficult life being a positivist :)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but @h are stronger, moreover if you get raised you'd be happy|pg||

nt|rcerreto: I like better 2@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: i like it better too:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup: 3nt +1 is my guess|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some communication problems- expect a club lead|pg||
nt|stc: good defense may keep dec in 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jbgood: better than 2@s anyhow:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|stc: just because the communication problems dec has no choice but @ds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we can see 3-3 diamonds - declarer cant and will be a little nervous about cashing club ace|pg||
nt|stc: no need to cash the A@c, play all @d then AK@h and @H|pg||
nt|runnerup: i think also that 3 @d doent promice spades,just diamonds and forcing,because yu cant force otherways with only 5 cards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok as cards lie - everthing is ok- but if hearts 4-2 then danger of losing 2 hearts and 3 spades- |pg||
nt|odysseus69: however I agree that he shouldnt cash club ace|pg||
nt|stc: there is no danger to loose 2@h and 3@h because defenders has no communications|pg||
nt|runnerup: 26 was not enought to bid game in other table -so leaders will win this board -bacauce 9 at least here|pg||
nt|stc: 2@h and 3@s I mean|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: right -no danger when diamonds 3-3 |pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 2@s is where "gazzilli" would have likely landed you|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|stc: and with @d 4-2 he needs 3@h tricks and K@s on side|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: team bessis have 9 more boards to score more is more likely:)|pg||

nt|roswolf: that 2@H SEEMS TO BE A 1 SUITER|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a 2 suited overcall|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt and 5@d are ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: very aggressive reopening double there, at all green and facing a PH. risk-reward ratio not obviously in favor of action|pg||
nt|roswolf: a firm 3@D followed by a firmer 3nt!?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rcerreto: after all, there was a tiny chance that she didn't appear to have tested|pg||
nt|jbgood: 8-12 balanced|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s will miss 3nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe olech should have bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: Piek wont let them play anyhow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so difficult for south to bid it from his side|pg||
nt|granguru:  Bubbo de Boer, westra, Leufkens, Peter jansen, Westerdorf, Muller, Jaap trounborst were the boys|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but it wasn't the case here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: may try 3@S -YUK!?|pg||

nt|roswolf: south knows he is being mugged but ...........|pg||
nt|hedyg: that independant caps key again Geoff?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both N/S players created problems and now its a guess if they can reach a makable game|pg||

nt|MolvaM: or the devil made you do it? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south hopefully will bid soon|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a fraction better than spade finesse|pg||
nt|stc: slam needs K@s + @s 2-2 or some sort of friendly @c, about 40% I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|jbgood: can even afford 2 trump losers now since clubs behave|pg||
nt|rcerreto: several alternatives to evaluate|pg||

pc|d3|nt|hedyg: would you start with A@S?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but he has to think|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I wouldn't but it could be right|pg||
nt|jbgood: @s ace and a small one is surely an alternative|pg||
nt|hedyg: ace in any case and think some more :p|pg||
nt|jbgood: but so many other ways|pg||
pc|d4|nt|MolvaM: hands must be bid on the same day that they were dealt :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@D is not a bad spot looking at the n/s cards alone|pg||
nt|hedyg: depending on the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont play lower level lightners, only vs slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room 3NTreached with simple elegance|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: disaster looms|pg||
nt|hedyg: the timid double by E in OR did not help the defense|pg||

pc|s3|nt|roswolf: fielders choice almost|pg||

pc|s7|pg||

nt|stc: yes, and hard to localize the unknown Q|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can make on diamond lead but dont think they will get one|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
