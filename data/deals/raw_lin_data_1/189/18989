nt|daman: East almost has to have the @H Q in order to have bid 3@C   which showed a good hand|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw 120-104 or 106? website reads 104|pg||
nt|royhughes: so declarer might take his chance for an overtrick by ducking|pg||

nt|jfaria:  weak nt and a rubish stayman by n|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: expect 2NT to be @D transfer, and 3@C = likes @Ds|pg||
nt|glen: and now W has to decide is it a good day for not vulnerable games|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: so 3@H = singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: diff when u have 2 singletons :)|pg||
nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
nt|rado: @D lead and @S underlead Ak will beat it but unlikely|pg||
nt|pelu: many would X in S, but with a passed partner "Pepsi" passed|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jfaria:  just in time for an exciting board :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, 5@S will make|pg||
nt|jfaria:  who could bid it?|pg||
nt|glen: W may think his 4@Ss means that E has a singleton or void|pg||
nt|jbgood: red card means not so quiet<.9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|galadriel: Do you think North should bid one more? Or is he worried to push them into makingslam?|pg||
nt|thenapster: hi all:)|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but as u said, since NV, he passes|pg||
nt|barnets: just 2 imps|pg||

nt|thenapster: :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|galadriel: his|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think the light opening by W succeeded|pg||
pc|sK|nt|glen: what was that about fines for slow play, how about fines for slow bidding?|pg||
nt|tsadek: I like Verhees bid of 3@S in closed room , Force his pd to bid 4@C with K@C|pg||
nt|pelu: not easy when two players from so dif nations and diff style play together|pg||
nt|jbgood: and I guess peter is anxious to see another century this last session|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jfaria:  my connection is so slow that i fear commenting one game after the one is played :(|pg||
nt|jbgood: if prd was kind he could win a @c trick...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|pelu: 5@H ask for @DQ - better 5Nt ask for @C-cue|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|pelu: what a start - 9 trick in @C and @D and bidding dieed out in 2@D - in 1. and 2. they would bid on 4-level :)|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@S = natural|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: all bbo tables - http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|barnets: In 5@D east led a top spade and switched a low club dec won Q and led a low heart to the 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meckwell got to use their unusual jump   so 1@D-DBL-2@H was 5@S & 4+@H, non-invite|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: here NL had 5Â½ bidding-round to find 4@S with 6@s almost cold|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Only 1 IMP in it, but that could be important with the scoreline this close|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Corrected now|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: sry bad claim|pg||
nt|Walddk5: np|pg||
nt|brotherp: ending up in 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: in the other room EW made six bids without @S, but then accidently bid the suit to play there|pg||
nt|rado: we've seen many wild openings those days:)|pg||
nt|psyck: well, if they just play trump, that may also work|pg||
nt|glen: sadly all bbo tables do not fit nicely into my iphone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: the 4@S bid here will be enough to get to slam now|pg||
nt|glen: even though EW are just temporary italians, they will use roman keycard blackwood|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure ita not easy to find out that the hands fit so well|pg||
nt|glen: Q. what is 2NT, A. unknown to us, but likely forcing game try, that in this case is a slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|tsadek: 2NT want to know 2@S with 3card or 4card|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT could be invit+|pg||
nt|tsadek: 4@S max 4card @S|pg||
nt|jfaria:  they always do , the making games and all the others :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = natural|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D = waiting|pg||

pc|h4|nt|alok_daga: True,Rado,the openings r getting wilder by the day|pg||
nt|galadriel: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  "wrong sided" in open got a @d lead|pg||
nt|glen: yikes to that X|pg||
nt|twcho: I guess they are not native German but immigrants from other countries|pg||
pc|h8|nt|glen: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: if so, then 4@s stronger than 3@s|pg||
nt|glen: or in this case, reverse wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the funny thing is the light to wild openings don't seem to ever work, one wonders the attraction|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Query,wud u sell 2 a 2dmnds or xle from Easts hand?P marked with strength|pg||
nt|rado: Declarer mau like @c continuation|pg||
nt|athene: @CA10 is pretty good support|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: it would not occur to me for sure at this vul|pg||
nt|athene: given partner has bid the suit twice|pg||
nt|fokal: here they can make 6 @c (even 7 ! ). Can they reach it ?|pg||
nt|fokal: 4 @c will defnetly help|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure they will bid 6@c|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D rkcb?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: east does not have a second bid|pg||
nt|rado: 3 rounds of @C now|pg||
nt|jbgood: a bit too much by doubling first and then 3@s afterwards?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: its difficult - I dont expect many tables will bid this slam|pg||
nt|brotherp: declarer will go after @h's|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@C surprises me a bit with 5422 minimum...  thats why i expected 3@D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@D = rkc|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4NT = 2 no Q|pg||
nt|barnets: now rod has to guess hearts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jfaria:  E and N bidding @h first meaning @s |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|galadriel: West would be ruffing with his natural trump trick|pg||
nt|pelu: Smirnow from Russia and Piekarek from Poland|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|pelu: how can u ask with void in H?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess meckstroth decided that after his partner showed extras *and* rebiddable clubs, 5@C was going to be safe, despite the poor diamond holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: M Bessis also led @H|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: so i was wrong - again:)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they don't have exclusion available in the auction|pg||
nt|barnets: low heart ?|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont belive this trick|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: running scores - http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/ofrunda1.html|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fokal: everybody told, 6 they bid for sure|pg||
nt|pelu: but then Thomas in on @HA return @dJ a-d easy 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe the 6 is better|pg||
nt|barnets: than the J|pg||
nt|barnets: wanting east to bounce|pg||
nt|barnets: with the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thomas played the 6 in tempo|pg||
nt|jbgood: will he find it?|pg||
nt|barnets: if he plays the J easier for east to play low|pg||
nt|jbgood: E has bid as if he owns the deck - so perhaps he may have @h A and Q|pg||
nt|barnets: with the ace of course|pg||
nt|pelu: but the both play for Germany now|pg||
nt|barnets: east has shown a very strong hand on bidding|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Declarer knows East has the @SAK, and by inference has the minor suit kings - no club switch|pg||
nt|barnets: and west a little something|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes Mark, but East has not revealed @SQ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Would West raise with just four trumps and maybe a couple of queens? He might|pg||
pc|dK|nt|alok_daga: If u follow Mike Lawrence he shud be competing!|pg||
nt|galadriel: last trick for the defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jfaria:  1 imp back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He could have @HA instead of the two queens|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|brotherp: short of a chinese finesse|pg||
nt|athene: hard when your useful void is in partner's first-bid suit|pg||
nt|fokal: let me tell to the kibs, that the players don't see the 4 hands , even the world masters|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|psyck: unless they play weak NT, S could have invited after 2@s|pg||
nt|barnets: i think that play is understandeable|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||

nt|daman: same contract and same lead in the CR|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|daman: sorry   yes    3@H|pg||
nt|daman: hey Al|pg||
nt|royhughes: Is Meckstroth worth a bid over 2@h?|pg||
nt|daman: not likely|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|daman: but who am I to talk|pg||
mb|3C|nt|royhughes: He has a good hand opposite good hearts, no so good opposite Axxxxx|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT asks|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Anyone know what 2@s would have been?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bigtrain: i might  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: losing only one @h trick in this lay-out|pg||
nt|daman: Hoping for good @Hs is aiming for a small target|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@S is NF|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C is minimum|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fokal: but the 4 th round of @d can make the day|pg||
nt|royhughes: The heart suit might play for 1 loser but there is a potential promotion of the heart 7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they don't play polish or anything of that ilk...  just ordinary weak 2s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the responses to 2NT are basically quantitative...  the more you bid the better you have|pg||
nt|royhughes: Interesting defensive problem -- NS want to play a 4th diamond after a round of trumps has been played|pg||
nt|fokal: have to play 3 more round of @d now|pg||
nt|royhughes: but I don't think a 4th diamond works if no trumps have been played|pg||
nt|fokal: even before is ok|pg||
nt|fokal: but with S card on the lead it will already be difficultÃ© to play another @d|pg||
nt|royhughes: Oh, yes I think Oliv is right|pg||
nt|fokal: difficult|pg||
nt|daman: 1 IMP difference now|pg||
nt|fokal: I play the 4th @d what would W ruff with ?|pg||
nt|fokal: the 9 ? promotion, something else ? I overruff and promotion again :)|pg||

nt|barnets: chance to hit back here for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: easy come - easy go - this look as IMP for US|pg||
mb|p|nt|thenapster: denmark* of course|pg||
nt|glen: this should be the big @C opening|pg||
mb|1S|nt|alok_daga: Shud be dead push,this brd|pg||
nt|thenapster: 16+|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell just decided to go with the odds - that one of partner's keycards was the @HA|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: S passes to show some 0-4 maybe|pg||
nt|glen: S will pass as many times as legal on the auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: well i guess they could jump to 5@H but that commits them to slam :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rodwell in 3@H after opening 2@H|pg||
nt|pelu: no I exp a misscore -2 IMp for US so still 3 IMP for Bessis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-18 HCP, 5+@S, maybe stronger if good 2-suiter|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: Denmark and Hungary (against Monaco) bid 6@s|pg||
nt|glen: how good was the 6@H contract?|pg||
nt|glen: with @D KT doubleton, was nice layout|pg||
nt|rado: now some quiet board 4@S for just|pg||
nt|brotherp: sort off a @s-partial for NS; wonder if they will enter the bidding though|pg||
nt|barnets: south made a X of 2@H that put huge pressure on partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|tsadek: 6@H will be great from N side|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+|pg||
mb|2C|an|.|nt|glen: or runout to @Cs|pg||
nt|psyck: most play some artificial bids on strong @c, but 1@d not alerted|pg||
nt|glen: EW is a sponsor-pro partnership, and they tend to try to keep things error free, let the meckwells win the imps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = nat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C could be 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S overcall might cause a little more trouble|pg||
nt|fokal: well I have to say that it's quite surprising that they didn't reach that slam after the 4 @c bid, but I was still though to give value to the void in partner suit|pg||
nt|athene: but he decided the risk/reward ratio not good enough|pg||
mb|2H|nt|galadriel: This may not be everyone's opening|pg||
nt|jfaria:  6 on a finesse?|pg||
nt|galadriel: And will probably get them to slam|pg||
nt|jfaria:  well EW got kucky with a light opening first board|pg||
nt|galadriel: My view is that, if it is your partnership style to open these hands, that's fine, but the system must have good brakes|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hard to stY OU NOW, WITH W HAND|pg||
nt|jfaria:  sry capps|pg||
nt|glen: oh, S did not run out|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Denmark must feel loosing some ground but they r dealing with avery tuff pair in this room|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a bet: this time NS will bid slam :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is nat (coincidentally) asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: meckwell are fairly conservative slam bidders|pg||
nt|athene: "there are lots of ways to win imps with +680" as meckstroth says in his book :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = any 3fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rado: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, quite a view|pg||
nt|psyck: S not liking his options at all|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c could be too high, with 2@d going down|pg||
nt|pelu: 2 @D ruff will set up @D then no need to find @cQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: he could now bid 1@C - that would get partner to stop these doubles and play the contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: the axe in this room too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is supposed to be Gazzilli   but last set Piek passed 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  nebulous @d opening in precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  all this must be scientific and of c forcing|pg||
nt|galadriel: I guess 2@C is GF|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or321t7-2.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1@H is 4+ spades or a GF relay|pg||
nt|brotherp: meck bid game as expected in the open room; Denmark need to get something going|pg||
nt|barnets: so can he make it ?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - this may just make - for a double game swing|pg||
nt|barnets: he can afford 2 trump losers and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: but for sure I like the 2@s bid better than the agrressive pass by Thomas in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - much better |pg||
nt|barnets: h does not have atrump to lead|pg||
nt|barnets: that is always bad|pg||
nt|barnets: as a trump lead is standout|pg||
nt|pelu: @H lead and then @D to A and @Dq?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk1: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 x 16 in the finals on Wednesday|pg||
nt|glen: it is like the pass over 1@D showed some values|pg||
nt|psyck: i dont understand 3N at all, N already showed his hand|pg||
nt|brotherp: and this is not what they need - although u might say opps have missed game (5@D seems unbiddable though)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck has a rule...  the 480-50 rule|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry wrong hand on lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: even if he goes 1 down it is a tenner gained|pg||
nt|barnets: just 5 tumps to lead :)\|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to find but after a @C-lead closew to down 2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|Walddk5: 1NT  11-13|pg||
nt|galadriel: 1@H is nat or GF, I'm told|pg||
nt|thenapster: very bad|pg||
nt|fokal: yes they should reach this one|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, 4+ spades or GF relay|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/norway/groetheim-tundal.pdf|pg||
nt|jfaria:  only @d lead will cooperate with EW goal|pg||
nt|galadriel: I somehow don't think that will happen...|pg||
nt|thenapster: no dbl no trouble|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c could have even made with @h fin , this is prayerless|pg||
nt|brotherp: difficult for West to rightly appraise the bare @h Ace|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fokal: 4@s was rkcb in @h ?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck has a rule - "the 460-50 rule" it's much better to be +480 then -50|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 580-50|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 480-50|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jfaria:  good thing 4 N nerves, he must stil be depressed by B15|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither pair could stop in a 7 card fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the 2-level|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h would play well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: need on 3 entries: @S-ruff, @HA and later @CK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rado: Defense should continue @H to stop overtrick now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S is RKC here|pg||
nt|pelu: this 2 teams realy like to entertain kibs - 111 IMPs in 1. segment, and here we go again|pg||
nt|jbgood: the difference between going 1 down and making is a mere 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|april7: hand and 2 aces*|pg||
nt|barnets: well @D hook @D ruff is 4 @HA ruff is 6 and 2 trumps are 8|pg||
nt|pelu: GIB: 8 tricks in @S for Ns - and GIB is better than me :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jfaria:  can see nothing besides @d hook|pg||
nt|galadriel: Nor can I|pg||
nt|barnets: or he could just ruff 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk5: I see 11 IMPs to Bulgaria|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jfaria:  but W will try to get as much count as he can|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: well, no entry for @h fin in the 1st place though :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so this bad board in both rooms is kind of lucky for Bessis as they only lose once rather than twice|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|psyck: so just traded -1 for -2 or so, no big deal undoubled|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/index.php?r=348267|pg||
nt|barnets: when west found 4 trumps in north the save did not work well|pg||
nt|jbgood: new leaders...|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: running scores - http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/ofrunda1.html|pg||
nt|pelu: so 3. board in a row where Meck/Well outbid/ outplay Smirnov/Piekarek|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do pepsi-lev play real multi  or is this always a weak 2@H/@S opener?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: I think that correct result is on running scores site|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 2@D includes a strong balanced hand  [2N opener is artificial]|pg||

nt|jfaria:  EW got nt first in our room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunately we call both forms "multi"   when the always weak 2M should be "Wagner"|pg||
mb|4S|nt|glen: sad you can't win both the pairs and teams, but nice to share gold medals|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X = cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: and hopefully for them playing in @h 's |pg||
nt|bigtrain: let me do a better job of explaining meck's 480-50 rule...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: it's better to be +480 than -50 -- in other words its better to miss a slam than bid one and go down|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/ofrunda1.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: some how a partscore got in here, will call the TD|pg||
nt|jfaria:  sometime NS will find @d|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|glen: losing teams can join the pairs event on the next day, so only two final teams missed pairs completely|pg||
nt|pelu: very few pairs only use 2@D as weak major - in Scandinavia for sure 1-2 strong options|pg||
nt|jbgood: with no entries in S this might make even given N has 2 spade tricks (he is entitled to his club ace - W discarding - and that is that)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|alok_daga: gud xle|pg||
pc|h7|nt|glen: in the other room E led a trump|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps west had done his work in the open with his preempt to 3@S|pg||
nt|jbgood: not that easy to win 3 NT on a spade lead...|pg||
nt|pelu: but after the bidding West is favorit to @cQ and @DJ|pg||
nt|barnets: Rodwell made a very tricky 3N in last set|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|glen: assuming the JT98 lead would not hurt, and could stop a @C ruff|pg||
nt|glen: here E switches to that horse at trick two|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S lost an entry, but still in the run|pg||
nt|galadriel: For anyone unfamiliar with VG on BBO, if you put your cursor over result from open room, you can see the bidding thee|pg||
nt|galadriel: there|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|galadriel: Also, if you click on movie you can see all the results of the match - click on open room|pg||
nt|jfaria:  except if are wearing a Mac with no Bo software as i'm doing :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt make = -11 - down 1 = -15 - so gamebonus here are 4 IMP :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|glen: if NS had enough communication after drawing trumps, could bring in @Ds for no losers|pg||

pc|s2|nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||

pc|cA|nt|alok_daga: Mansfield proved right yet again,5level belongs 2 opponent.5hrts=1dwn thus this 300 the best they cud do|pg||

nt|thenapster: nope|pg||
nt|thenapster: i think the final teams going for final A|pg||
nt|thenapster: like the semi finals..|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|pelu: diff - even with open cards - to find more that 7 tricks for N|pg||
nt|jbgood: it is makeable, but first hurdle is clubs|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: sometimes you delay playing the critical suit to find out which defender might have Jxxx|pg||
pc|s6|nt|thenapster: thats the way it was in the mixed i played last week|pg||
nt|brotherp: next hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: here he is always going to play king then ace of spades so can only pick up four with rodwell, so that doesn't really apply|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't hurt anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 IMP to Bessis from board 2: here NS bid and made 5@D (here 4@h-1 by EW)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the women's final, Turkey are walking all over the mighty Dutch ladies. 51 IMPs up! And in the seniors, Grenthe (France) is 50 ahead against Pharon (England/Sweden)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|glen: 6 tricks|pg||

nt|jfaria:  lol|pg||
nt|glen: that is quite the upset, I would gather that Zimmerman will support my full day KOs approach|pg||
nt|athene: more strong club practice for NS|pg||
nt|bigtrain: we seem to have skipped board 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure it is just an evaluation issue   here Smirnov saying he would have bid 3@S over a weak 2@H opener   some might not think hand good enough, we don't play dummy as well ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: all bbo tables - http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php or http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brotherp: big challenge here: difficult to reach 6@c it seems|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Mahaffey 22-1 this set|pg||

mb|2S|an|.|nt|fokal: great job by smirnoff-piekarek to bid and make 5 @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 52 IMP after 5 boards - will they break the record from 1 segment?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|galadriel: A @C lead will scupper this contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: negative @d ; but that seems overly pessimistic|pg||
nt|jfaria:  EW will steal some space i presume|pg||
nt|brotherp: i guess we just let them bid away|pg||
mb|3D|nt|glen: another 1NT|pg||
nt|jfaria:  theu did not |pg||

nt|alok_daga: true.on club Q lead will have 2 play hrt 2 ACE,DMND FINNESEE 2 MAKE THE CONTRACT|pg||
nt|jfaria:  i?m told S already bid his @c suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT = 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT a natural raise (believe it or not) :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: i really dont think that is on their mind at all, Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Smirnov DBL could include a game forcing hand  [2@H=negative free bid]  he's just 3 aces short of holding that hand|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR S pass over 1@S - and sold out to 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if max 18 the very optimist 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: declarer will punch out the @S ace|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think they r very closee to bidding this one|pg||
nt|brotherp: 2@S might be clubs; and 2NT might be pre-accept with an honor....but then again not knowing their agreements that's just a wild guess|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@s = @c and now S is describing his shape i'm told|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is natural invite|pg||
nt|pelu: ok that make sense|pg||
nt|pelu: Michel is a conservativ bidder but pass out 2@S??|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: i believe Meckwell play 2nt response to 1nt opener as asking for a 5-card major, but maybe 1nt on this sequence denies a 5-card major|pg||
nt|bigtrain: excuse me///  noticed 4th seat|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 18-19|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no it doesn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if given to Master Solvers' Club   which would get more votes for south hand  PASS or 2@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: lev: sory Jacek|pg||
pc|s9|nt|brotherp: seems impossible for south to bid 6 ..not holding any ace|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = 3fit 5-7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jfaria:  a mild slam try by S but that's it|pg||
nt|jfaria:  killing lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: club lead in the other room made things sort of easy|pg||
nt|bigtrain: otherwise - big club, little diamond, 1@H = 4+ ORF|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam in 24 (6@h) bid by 11 out of 26|pg||
nt|rado: declarer will need Opps to touch @D suit to make this otherwise down 1|pg||
nt|pelu: I agree with pass to 1@S but not to 2@s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: high standard here in the A-swiss|pg||
nt|bigtrain: little diamond = 0-7 artificial|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jfaria:  as Anne pointed out|pg||
nt|jfaria:  anyway S hand is limited... |pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: in open room board 18 - 5S|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: sr 5 d|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: sry|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ORF = one round force|pg||
nt|barnets: so north is worried about a club ruff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|glen: and end with more than enough tricks|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but the slow approach from N tells him to bid 6 wd|pg||

nt|jfaria:  So the Danes bid game on board 18, not a good game but one that makes :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: opportunities yet again|pg||
nt|athene: when you lead the @SK you are pretty much sure to have KQ or so|pg||
nt|athene: so a defender over you with the ace can duck and he knows it probably won't cost|pg||
nt|barnets: but it could be a singleton|pg||
nt|barnets: easy for us all here to make it|pg||
nt|barnets: seeing 4 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: precision style|pg||
nt|jfaria:  precision 2@c|pg||
nt|thenapster: flat 3nt here|pg||
nt|glen: meckwell could very well open this S hand 1NT|pg||
nt|ritong: in the other room, east opened the bidding|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: but if the defender under you has the ace he might be a bit more worried|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|.|nt|pelu: so 3 board and 32 IMP :)|pg||
nt|athene: if you had only KQx, say, then it might cost a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose, forcing 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=7+ hcp, 3+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: Thomas was looking for a @s weaker than the 2 but he only had the Jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but usually 4+|pg||
mb|2S|nt|glen: it seems that NS use 1NT as a game force relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: so he had to cash it :)|pg||
mb|2N|an|.|nt|glen: they will ask 84 questions, then reach 3NT|pg||
nt|ritong: making things a bit easier|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 19-20 2NT here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=Puppet 3@C  for some short suit game/slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: an interesting treatment indeed|pg||
mb|4S|nt|galadriel: 3NT can't make on a @S lead|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s lead.. only count 8 tricks|pg||
nt|galadriel: But after 1NT- 3NT in other room, East led a natural @C|pg||
nt|jfaria:  my mac is rather slow today|pg||
nt|jfaria:  big swing|pg||
nt|thenapster: so south will show 11-14 with 5332 and north will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT is interesting, with 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: doesn't matter here, but we will wait & see if it makes a difference in the coming deals|pg||
nt|glen: specs voting for XX to play here|pg||
nt|psyck: he can simply play @h for 9th trick in 3N on this bidding rather than trying @d|pg||
nt|brotherp: reaching 6@H seems likely now|pg||
nt|ritong: west*|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: This auction gave West the chance to overcall @S|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah!|pg||
nt|glen: now E is feeling the heat|pg||
nt|psyck: E wondering what the 2@h x was all about|pg||
nt|pelu: Team Bessis have played 2 pairs the hole tournament, Mahaffey are 3 pairs - i would understand if Bissis team tired now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smirnov going to game regardless so why bother giving opponents info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 2 of Bessis players still in their 20s  [i think]|pg||
nt|pelu: even harder for young players - they try to make IMPs on every board :) - but Meck/well prob play almost all boards also|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: only 3 top-losers in 4@s but not 10 tricks|pg||
nt|glen: E hunting for a number here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  again the slow approach may help E to bid on|pg||
nt|brotherp: 6@H very interesting - after D!A lead u might play for the C!K to be offside - making for a very complicated hand|pg||
nt|brotherp: looks like a possible trump-squeeze ending|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec asks did east really play a low @D with KJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: w ending with @s J9 , 1 trump and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|brotherp: e ending with 4 spades and bare c!A|pg||
nt|brotherp: and south being squeezed|pg||
nt|brotherp: lets see|pg||
nt|brotherp: btw sorry for the comments with the ! ---still not completely used to the interface|pg||
nt|jfaria:  that would be a line for  a jr on a jamed VG :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: east has a very big hand looking at the bidding|pg||
pc|s8|nt|galadriel: now it's ok|pg||
nt|glen: he passes in reasonable tempo to keep his pd's options open|pg||
nt|psyck: S opens @h, they gf, pd surely can't be wanting to penalize 2@h...but E is the one with @h void :)|pg||
nt|barnets: it seems very odd|pg||
nt|barnets: when he had it down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: yes he really played small diamond with KJ|pg||
mc|11|nt|glen: gives up beer card early, never a good idea|pg||

nt|yuval10: the European-only championship is a lot older of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: A difficult decision for him. M.Bessis did well here.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes indeed. 2NT can be an effective preempt|pg||
nt|barnets: the closed european championships is a long event with a lot of very strong teams|pg||

nt|glen: 11 high card points, game unlikely|pg||
nt|brotherp: smooting lead for declarer|pg||
nt|pelu: a very lucky layout for EW - when @HQJ drop there are 11 tricks for EW in @d|pg||
nt|ritong: unexpected|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's usually true for meckwell|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|barnets: this could make|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|jfaria:  hugly cards in Lev's hand, but good position of K @S still a hope|pg||
nt|jbgood: points - but not tricks...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even when playing on nickell team|pg||
nt|jbgood: (unlikely) spade guess for the overtrick|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rado: maybe our kibs from Netherlands will help?|pg||
nt|psyck: OK, now I understand what Lotan meant when he said we can expect some aggresion by NS|pg||
nt|brotherp: not finessing risky with @d 6-2|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think E is in control|pg||
nt|brotherp: wonder if he can read @d 4-lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: trick slams are the toughest to bid|pg||
nt|fokal: oups|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jfaria:  at this time i guess E already knows about W @h |pg||
nt|galadriel: strong @C auctions are very useful in these hands as they allow lots of room for exploration|pg||
nt|jfaria:  indeed|pg||
nt|athene: maybe if Rodwell had bid 4@C or 4@H over 3NT (good hand for spades) they might get there|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he's not good enough for 4@C but he could make the bid if he had a better hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: everything friendly here, so will make them all|pg||
nt|fokal: does 3 @s shows support ?|pg||
nt|athene: if he would super-accept 3@H with most 4-card support then i think he is really max for spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: or "may" perhaps more correct|pg||
nt|fokal: and 2NT is 20-21 ?|pg||
nt|athene: if you just count points he only nas 19 but really that is not your average 19 count|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 19-20|pg||
nt|fokal: ok|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs suggest 4@c over 3 NT... N's hand very suitbale|pg||
nt|fokal: in that case he is maximum indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: only 4@H in OR so 13 more|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jfaria:  with no oposition i guess they will reach 6|pg||
nt|galadriel: the @H10 is a big card :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: think it will - he cannot play S for 5 hearts?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jfaria:  better in @h, any imp may become precious|pg||
pc|h2|nt|galadriel: Indeed|pg||
nt|athene: ona  4-1 spade break you might still survive in slam even on a diamond lead - need @CK onside and the four trumps to have 3 hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: 45 IMP after 4 boards - that only prove, that also top-players make mistakes - and it has been some difficult board|pg||
nt|athene: then you can get both of south's diamonds away in time|pg||
nt|athene: the key to slam being so good is having two long suits to run, and a 4@C cue would not show that, but if he could bid 4@H showing a trick source and a big hand for spades...that ...|pg||
nt|athene: might do the job|pg||
nt|barnets: must guess hearts|pg||
pc|hT|nt|glen: 3NT in the other room is one of those few 3NT contracts where there are 8 tricks, but almost no hope of 9|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: and the 2 other pairs 1 half in every round |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think most impressive endurance is shown by commentators -- much harder than at the table where you sometimes get to relax as dummy   [heavy sarcasm]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room 4@H undoubled after Rodwell opened 2N=19-20|pg||
nt|jbgood: kib asks if W can play the spade king now - sure he can! Must be his best chance for setting the contract to find prd with the ace...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but then of course south would be worried about the @CAK :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|galadriel: well done|pg||
nt|jfaria:  no swing in sight|pg||
nt|jfaria:  correction, can make 7|pg||

nt|barnets: if west plays a thrid diamond|pg||

nt|bigtrain: i understand the initial pass (although i would) but to not balance 3@H seems unusal|pg||
nt|bigtrain: (although i would bid)|pg||
nt|royhughes: The absence of top heart lead will suggest to declarer that the ace of clubs is surely wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: the USA 4 playing are very tough match players and Meckwell have a string of success in long close matches|pg||
nt|barnets: stamina is important in a long competition|pg||
nt|royhughes: A kibitzer pointed out that after winning the diamond, losing a club and getting a 2nd diamond, declarer will probably draw trump before playing another club|pg||

nt|jbgood: difficult to find the @h lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D was a one round force|pg||
nt|pelu: ok 8 toptricks - better played by S (@hJ in dummy) - if u need u can finess in @c|pg||
nt|jbgood: not that it would have mattered much|pg||

pc|s7|nt|glen: the @H lead sets up 4@S, 2@H and 1@D|pg||
nt|psyck: those who open 1@c with 44 in minors have an outside chance to get to 2@c here|pg||

nt|pelu: ecelent operator at the table|pg||
pc|sA|nt|glen: the problem for N is that he did not show a great 14 high card point hand with 2NT|pg||
nt|pelu: np - u are doing fine|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brotherp: difficult to beat|pg||
nt|brotherp: how about the !J lead (ducked) :>|pg||
nt|brotherp: @S-J that is|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brotherp: d! suit nicely divided for declarer|pg||
nt|brotherp: @d-suit|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fokal: yes, thx|pg||
nt|fokal: N has to play @cs till he still have the @d stopper|pg||
nt|athene: it might look obvious to us to set up the clubs with a diamond entry|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but he has to play a small @C now|pg||
nt|athene: but rodwell may be worried that declarer has @CJ9xxx|pg||
nt|fokal: and I'd say that for his point of view, it's quite clear|pg||
nt|bigtrain: to keep an entry|pg||
nt|fokal: I'm guessing he is hesitating betwenn K of @c and small @c|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that is if declarer can devine the @HQ is doubleton|pg||
nt|fokal: true athene|pg||
nt|fokal: though I don't know meckwell way of signaling|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 10 is attitude here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: rev attitude that is|pg||
nt|fokal: so it can be from 10x|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
nt|fokal: it usually is from 10x actually|pg||
nt|pelu: then better lead @CK (for count)|pg||
nt|fokal: hum|pg||
nt|athene: @C10 is consistent with @C10x so not at all obvious to rodwell that he can set up the clubs|pg||
nt|fokal: are you sure the 10 doesn't show the 9 on the Q lead ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fokal: (which can be from QJ ?)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brotherp: so 8 tricks will be there now..lets see if pepsi can work some magic|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|glen: those who open 1@C and are not playing 2+ etc,|pg||
nt|psyck: right, which is why i said outside chance only|pg||
nt|glen: now it looks like NS will cash out, since playing @Cs would not be right|pg||
nt|glen: however sometimes the defense thinks 1NT always has 2-3@S for 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that by NS Q ask for count, and K for suit preference|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: easy 8 trick - 2 @S ruff and just wait (need to take @HK also|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|pelu: disc @DK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh   smoke break   that makes more sense|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: we all see that declarer has potentially 6 trumps and two aces   however, if east has underled @h J, there is a choice to make, on the lead and perhaps later|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphpl8: bye|pg||
nt|pelu: but after a free bid by Jansma he could try once more|pg||
nt|glen: Balicki, with N hand for Monaco/Poland, overcalled 1@H and later bid @Ds|pg||
nt|fokal: ok now declarer can make it if he set us @s and guess the q of @h|pg||
nt|ritong: @hJ10|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well I have alot of sympathy with David Bakshi ( South in other room) for upgrading this hand|pg||
nt|glen: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or16runda1.html|pg||
nt|fokal: ok to late for setting up the @s :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bigtrain: absolutely because the Q shows either QJx (less than 4) or KQx(x) or AQJ(x) or AKQx(x)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|brotherp: we can all see that it's easy now: just play north for the @s-king|pg||
nt|brotherp: but pepsi might be inclined to place @S-king in the south-hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  and play 4 athrow in?|pg||
nt|brotherp: and then there are some funny throw-in squeeze kind of positions|pg||
nt|brotherp: yup|pg||
nt|jfaria:  lets see|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: if J10 of Qhs in East S cant make, sÃ¥ prob he will play for aytual layout|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brotherp: and he even might look at the @s 2 as a funny discard|pg||
nt|brotherp: i see; that's more logical (@h 8 discard)|pg||
nt|brotherp: askgaard guessing for @c J9 or @S q now|pg||
nt|dburn: weird sort of position, this|pg||
nt|jfaria:  if N plays a @s Pepesi must put the king|pg||
nt|dburn: even @cJ9 won't help him|pg||
nt|brotherp: and he can see @H 8 discard was more or less forced and not lavinthalish|pg||
nt|brotherp: depends on where pepsi places the @S K|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brotherp: but would north not play a spade if he didnt hold the king....|pg||
nt|ritong: well, if i decide that east has @h J0, i play the 9 on the lead and claim|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with QJxx he would lead the J|pg||
nt|fokal: oh ok|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not true... Q gets attitude|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: I would need notes at the table :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: or can he?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|glen: we don't have the beer garden scores in yet|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not allowed|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|jfaria:  I mean, if N plays a @s he must have the king for Pepsi win|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|galadriel: (Ithink) he showed 18-19|pg||
nt|jfaria:  so u must play him for holding the K|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
mc|10|nt|brotherp: y.. but then if he doesnt play a spade it does suggest the king|pg||
nt|brotherp: windows behind windows|pg||
nt|jfaria:  my point :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  lol|pg||
nt|dburn: how will declarer make the contract, if South has the king of spades?|pg||
nt|brotherp: really nice poker hand -- the 'same-ness' between poker and bridge cant be stressed enough|pg||
nt|brotherp: cross with the club and play the heart|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - but if that would work. North would have played a spade, not a club|pg||
nt|brotherp: we discussed that.. but north might be holding uncomfortable holdings like Jxxxx|pg||
nt|brotherp: so he wouldnt 'always' play a spade without the king|pg||
nt|brotherp: they might all feel like this will be the match-clincher|pg||
nt|brotherp: 5 more boards to go in a tight match|pg||

nt|jbgood: 2 @s would have been easy - 3 a bit more challenging, but ...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jfaria:  that will add some drama to final boards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: i think the spade lead ducked was a defensive winner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep   let opponents make the last guess|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|alok_daga: how gud can this nt be?QJ tight in 1 suit,1 suit barren.agreed 1cl 1sp response presents problems but 1nt?|pg||
nt|athene: in theory declarer has four spades, four diamonds and the @HA but he can never untangle all four diamonds|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jbgood: I bet he would have done that earlier in the day...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bigtrain: hard to see how he will make this|pg||
nt|athene: surely that was ace and another trump|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: small trump gives declarer TWO tricks - he can play three rounds of diamonds then ruff a heart and play the thirteenth diamond :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm looking forward to seeing what Meckstroth does with the East hand|pg||
nt|pelu: so down 2 for Ns or down 2 for EW - this board is typical for this last segment|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rado: will will make 10 since W cannot lead 2nd @H now|pg||

nt|barnets: north bid too much here for sure|pg||

mb|p|nt|rado: 5@S makable for EW now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|glen: interesting 2NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|glen: a bid underpowered by high card points, but the playing value is certainly 2NT|pg||
nt|psyck: good 5 card @d sequence & a couple more T's...|pg||
nt|ritong: an active double|pg||
nt|ritong: very active|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hcp don't come into play on those high level competitive auctions|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: all bbo tables: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ or http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still  at the 6-level the risk of DBL does seem very low|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rado: E will try for Slam for sure|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT=abandon all hope of a major suit fit|pg||
nt|psyck: Only 18.85 KnR points though.|pg||
nt|psyck: they better stay out of grand|pg||
nt|ritong: smirnov will not pass this if it arrives to him at 2@c|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange he didnt bid at once...|pg||
nt|ritong: but will it? it seems that someone wants to bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: at least E hasnt more to offer...|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: I think in 27 board is mistake, in open room they played -2 too.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rado: maybe 2nd transfer to show slam interest|pg||
nt|thenapster: they will bid only 6|pg||
nt|psyck: for all i know grand may make with @cJ finesse & a major suit squeeze on N though :)|pg||
nt|pelu: they all wont to bid - every time :) - only very few green pass-cards in the box|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: sure:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|galadriel: EW doing their best to keep NS out of game|pg||
nt|ritong: he finally found a green|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: And succeeding!|pg||
nt|galadriel: 10 back|pg||
nt|jfaria:  with 2 places to play, and the minor being @d N could double instead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: well - Piekarek has more cards than i thought...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the opening page of Italian Blue Team Bridge Book  Garozzo described a hand where partnership held 5 [FIVE] hcp  and grand slam was cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: W has good support so keeps the level low|pg||
nt|alok_daga: dont think they will have2 reach 5 East has expressed all he had 2 say|pg||
nt|thenapster: no sqeeze...south can keep 1098@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: oooops|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: as u see they all have 1 bid more :)|pg||
nt|pelu: @C lead and down 1 ?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|glen: nice squence by E|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: i prefer a self splinter of 4@C on second turn|pg||
nt|glen: 4@C gerber, and then 5NT, 6NT as the grand try|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rado: yes always good not to risk 5 lvl, nice bidding from EW here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps east showed his singleton|pg||
nt|alok_daga: assume 3hrts,3nt meant some sort of shortage|pg||
nt|jfaria:  tuff, only 2 boards left |pg||
nt|galadriel: For running scores http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|ritong: this contract looks cosy|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|glen: N nicely goes with a safe lead|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, major suit lead would have saved time for us though|pg||
nt|psyck: They stayed out of slam last deal other room too|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|psyck: so it still remains a relatively low scoring affair with no double digit swings|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3nt in open this may get too close|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|glen: rodwell also opening 1@S to keep it young|pg||
nt|athene: 7@C is a big bid with no trick source|pg||
nt|jbgood: a tall order|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs trumps 2-2 if trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes even a nine-card trump fit isn't enough, if that is all you have|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: and everything falls into place|pg||
nt|athene: lots of specs are saying he does have some spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but he knows his partner has a spade void|pg||
nt|fokal: he can win by ruffing 3 @s|pg||
nt|athene: so it will take a fair bit of work to get the spades set up|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but needs trump do to the fact he has only 1 entry|pg||
nt|athene: 4-3 spades and 2-2 trumps means everything is happy of course|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not exactly a laydown grand|pg||
nt|fokal: but it seems he need @cs 2-2|pg||
nt|pelu: some strange results on result page: Board 2 (open) 5@D - 1 on BBO scored as +600, Board 6 bridgemate: only 2Nt +1 not 3Nt making (here i this room)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: could play for both @S onside if he doesn't think trump splits|pg||
nt|athene: there are various options in spades like @SHx with north (ruff one then ruffing finesse)|pg||
nt|athene: or just the double ruffing finesse against south, yes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm offerring an alternative line|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yesterday, Zia ventured 'Zia's Rule': "Don't lead a trump against a grand slam", he said|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it diesn't work buthe may choose it since the other option is trump 22 and @S 43|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|athene: :) well the rule "ALWAYS lead a trump against a grand slam" is definitely a bad one|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or KQx in @S|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe zia has gone too far the other way|pg||
nt|pelu: the rule is: dont lead trump if pd has QJ :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: we can all see everything is nice, but the lead surely looks like a singleton...|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|galadriel: Maybe a spec can tell me if I'm wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: a 2. @H trick will make the contract|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a @d lead would have reduced this to 8|pg||

nt|jbgood: may even get 10 now - hearts friendly|pg||

nt|psyck: he doesn't want to run @d's before testing @s as no convenient discards|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: that won't be nearly as easy  even after non-@H lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: 2 x yesterday in slams decl missing QJxx, trumps were 2-2 and both times fines for down 1|pg||

mb|2N|nt|athene: will meckstroth double 4@S?|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: Only South is Junior National|pg||
nt|jfaria:  wc b|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: 4@S here doesn't work since @Hs play for two losers, and @Ds need for @C discards or there is a @C loser|pg||
nt|thenapster: and 3nt from south in heart lead also some problems|pg||
nt|brotherp: still a match it seems|pg||
pc|h3|nt|glen: not sure what 2@C shows, if it did not show @Ds, might get a @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: non-forcing 2N response to 1 of minor  is probably my least favorite treatment|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jfaria:  what is 3@s |pg||
nt|jfaria:  another lsot game|pg||
nt|athene: well he can surely double this :)|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, as walter underlined, every trip trip starts with one step|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: 2@D asks size and spade length by steps|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|brotherp: what happened to the td-board where lev made a bidding error?|pg||

pc|s3|nt|fokal: too bad , 4S may have won|pg||
nt|athene: a bit unlucky for EW perhaps; sometimes 5@C will work out much the best|pg||
pc|s2|nt|glen: 2@C may be a game force relay bid|pg||
nt|psyck: i thought they play 1N as gf relay :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: i hope you kibs appreciate that i cannot answer all private chats... just too many|pg||
nt|pelu: so 8 IMP - the average is only 7,46|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|glen: that was over 1@H|pg||
nt|psyck: but maybe that is only on 1@h open|pg||

nt|jbgood: as i said that one was entered:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jbgood: push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room just started bidding  11  [our 6@C undoubled]|pg||

mb|d|nt|galadriel: Last board now - |pg||

mb|r|an|strong|nt|vugraphpl8: sry|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but still emotion till las board|pg||
nt|brotherp: 5@C seems close now for Askgaard|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: @d lead sets up 3 tricks in 5@c?|pg||
nt|glen: i thought they were out of XX cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: big @C, little @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  strong for a passed hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|galadriel: Many thanks to Michal our VG operator - great job!|pg||
nt|psyck: guess a @d duck enough in 5@c|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - 3 rounds of @d sees 4@s home - sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|thenapster: A@H is onside...|pg||
nt|thenapster: so only diamond lead have to duck like you said|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 5@C now|pg||
nt|ritong: over opponent's transfer, bidding their suit can have two meanings, to be decided with your regular pard  either two suiter or general take/out|pg||
nt|dburn: or even 4@h - I guess that will make|pg||
nt|ritong: hello david|pg||
nt|pelu: but even 4@h make|pg||
nt|barnets: north gives south choice of games|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: @D duck is hard on a layout where N might have singleton @D and 1-2@Cs|pg||
nt|brotherp: good lead|pg||
nt|brotherp: and easy 2 off|pg||
nt|brotherp: seems to clinch victory for the mahaffey-guys|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 4+ forcing for 1 round|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A choice of very lucky games...|pg||
nt|jbgood: and game bid narrows the gap further|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jfaria:  yeap, regardless of result concerning b 24|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6-7 <4@S|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S for me is @H + minor, but Meck is not sure|pg||
nt|pelu: B10 3NT - the 9. trick on the lead, but even with neutral lead the defense has to be awake|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bigtrain: 2@S scrambling|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't 2@C deny even 3 spades?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D that is|pg||
nt|athene: i thought they bid 2@D with 5-7 and 3 spades|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes...  mistyped|pg||
nt|fokal: might be funny if in the other West does what some kib said , doubling 4 @h, and the auction ends up in 4 @hX|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|glen: unless the @D 9 holds|pg||
nt|thenapster: yes|pg||
nt|glen: and the polish @D 3 lead is best|pg||
nt|thenapster: i think after redbl|pg||
nt|thenapster: thats showes same number of cards|pg||
nt|bigtrain: <3...  still dark here :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|glen: last hand of the day for Mahaffey (the player, not the team)|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Large margins in the other two finals. Women: Turkey + 27 vs the Netherlands, and seniors Grenthe (France) +32 against Pharon (England/Sweden)|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is better|pg||
nt|dburn: I expect he is sure - he is just not sure which game will play better|pg||
nt|pelu: a very lucky misunderstanding - strange NS has been partners for many years|pg||
nt|barnets: as it makes with hearts 4-2 and clubs 2-2|pg||
nt|jbgood: since thay cannot attack diamonds repeatedly, the 3-3 split in trumps and 2-2 clubs makes this "easy"|pg||
nt|ritong: are you sure it is a missund, peter?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 11  Meckstroth in 5@CX after    1N-P-2@D-3@C//3@H-5@C-P-P//X|pg||

pc|h3|pc|c6|nt|vugraphpl8: the winner of senior teams will be grenthe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he knows the trump suit, assumes @SQ in South  [lev would bid 2@C with @SQ @CAK]   but what can he do with this info?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: not exactly sure  but all seem to start with  rise @HK|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and abandon trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the table i'm sure i'd quickly think   float @SJ   then long pause trying to talk myself out of that line|pg||
nt|pelu: can he make by playing 2!x@S (noQ) and the cross ruff?|pg||
nt|jbgood: spade jack seems to cover most bases|pg||
nt|ahollan1: problem with crossruff seems to be Pepsi trump honors -- but maybe then loser-on-loser|pg||

pc|c9|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe  playing Pepsi to hold  4=4=3=2 ??|pg||
