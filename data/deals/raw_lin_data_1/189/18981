nt|jfaria:  hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|kirp:  ok looks we r ready|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hi all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  hello |pg||
nt|royhughes: Welcome Sunil, Joao|pg||
nt|rcerreto: hi all|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Gerben42:  welcome back in Poznan|pg||
nt|davpro: Morning all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes   h   missing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult grand to bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems bochi plays in both rooms :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: Ola Joao, Hi all|pg||
nt|kirp:  interesting hand to start off with, NS in @Hs, EW in @Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup: here norht has 5-6 -majors and opened-now ew shoud find 5 @d that is the goal let see|pg||
nt|glen: the problem with 4@C is that 3NT is no longer possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|glen: the good news is that W can't show both majors as over 3@C|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  A splinter in North would do fine - in later defense|pg||
nt|jfaria:  ola Danilo|pg||
nt|granguru:  brogeland for Angelini team and zapadinski for Mirage arrived|pg||
nt|glen: with the @D layout, 5@C loses a @S and two @Ds|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|benjy:  Good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|davpro: Thx operator. It looked like an forcing pass-opening :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|runnerup: this is 200 -not enought but ..|pg||
nt|toral5: hello all|pg||
nt|toral5: so we start with a cracker|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: Who is Brogeland playing with?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty operator|pg||
nt|kirp:  they need to take ruff quickly or 4@H makes|pg||
nt|benjy:  Would be a normal 2NT reopening for me|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kirp:  intersting hand to start off with|pg||
nt|granguru:  this is round 6/7 of swiss stage in poznan, Poland|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like down 1 or 2|pg||
nt|benjy:  19-21|pg||
mb|p|nt|davpro: Ah- there the name came|pg||
nt|runnerup: @s ruff needed|pg||
nt|granguru:  Looks like precision system in NS |pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  You have seen too manu bad overcalls, when you sell out with the North hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: missing the @DQ they have to diagnose they have extra trump length to compensate|pg||
nt|kirp:  dangerous hand as 5@D makes EW|pg||
nt|glen: in 5@S there is a loser in each suit, and a @H ruff possible|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Joao and Roy|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hi Sunil and Roy|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@d bal ?|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW have doubled the opponents at a rather low level here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think 2@d may show a strong bal hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  looks like both pairs play some version of Precision @C|pg||
nt|glen: 5-over-5 bids have approximately a 90% chance of being wrong (you should have doubled instead)|pg||
nt|toral5: hi petur|pg||
nt|toral5: peter|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes, I agree|pg||
nt|benjy:  very unusual to play X then 1NT as a hand of this strength, is it possible he miscounted?!|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but someone insists to play it unusual (minors)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  routine 4@s 4 those 2|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards lie 5@D is down 2|pg||
nt|pelu: so same contract in both rooms|pg||
nt|benjy:  if you do play that then X then 2NT |pg||
nt|rcerreto: which I'd rather avoid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  south hand is known as Bridge World Death Hand (BWDH)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  invitational values with 3-card support for partner|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a nice hand with spade values and N has an easy raise to game with 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has built a trap - will remove to 5 @H, only losing 100 I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is there a reward for "slowest bid hand of the tournament" - without special reason...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello all|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Zaleski needs some results tocach up the playoffs |pg||
nt|benjy:  and a cold 3NT missed as a result - very odd|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|rcerreto: still, ! and then 1NT is commonly played with some 15-17 or the like|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Gerben42:  with Qxxxx x Axxx xxx North would pass and 4@S would be cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt played the other way round - no spade lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|danilo1: 4@S will make (prob. +1) .. .in ev. 5@D, declarer needs to guess @H (must play 9 from hand) for -2 |pg||
nt|runnerup: very dangerous I wander if 3nt was to play or some minors|pg||
nt|rv: Hi specs, warm regards from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Gerben42:  but there is normally no perfect answer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What a nice board to start with. South must play East for the @C Ace - or West for the same card single or double...! And 5 @H is fine|pg||
nt|toral5: and 5s is a mek|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 20 HCP looks way too much|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: 10 tricks are on ice here|pg||
nt|roswolf: players names will be up in a mo|pg||
nt|jbgood: going through the motions|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 controls and west will ask for the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Hans, all|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Ilya and Hans|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-lead, small @S back to defeat 5 @H|pg||
nt|jfaria:  kind of 18-20|pg||
nt|royhughes: Then presumably the double was for takeout|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: has to set up @Cs|pg||
nt|royhughes: East is in a tough spot here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wud it hv been better to take @Sa and run @C(|pg||
nt|jfaria:  if so, hard for W to bid something after O second round|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup: looks dangerous -all tricks possible|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed 4@s and E might have shown 4@h. I don't know their system :(|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@C could have been made NS|pg||
nt|benjy:  hi|pg||
nt|rcerreto: so, a solid 3NT goes away|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: didnt bother played his pard for 3+ diamonds or the queen|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D may yhave promised 3+diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  @S suit was hidden by N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: who can hold Qxx diamonds? thats the question|pg||
nt|kirp:  S must be disappinted that dummy has all 3 missing trumps|pg||
nt|benjy:  At this level this kind of occurrence is very unusual|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jfaria:  TO|pg||
pc|h6|nt|glen: however the reason for that 90% is often just a small problem in the layout of the cards that defeats the contract|pg||
nt|rv: 4@d is namyats, 8.5+ tricks with @s as trumps|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: only problem is the potential 3-0 trump break|pg||
nt|roswolf: doesnt matter here:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does the lead tell any story|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: puppet i think - then 3@d shows 1 or 2 4 card majors, and deny 5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - and therefore the dbl by N a bit speculative|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hawe45:  13 tricks - over|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  or 12|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bagman: One of the answers is to use an artificial tool to separate hands with 3 card spades and those with 0-2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 6 is down with @H lead|pg||
nt|davpro: y- that was my guess too|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jbgood: then responder bids the suit he doesnt have |pg||
pc|s4|nt|rcerreto: indeed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|royhughes: I think Sunil may be right that going after clubs is better|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru:  Gomerov's X is a risky one...with 6@c and the void it is almost sure partner is waiting for a x to be converted|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|runnerup: y a big swing for Joker to start|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like down 2 however|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N looked ambiguous to me|pg||
nt|royhughes: It is a complicated hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|danilo1: both teams ... actually, this is the last table in grop A|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  Funny hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: funny for N/S |pg||
nt|hawe45:  1590 - a score not seen so often...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jfaria:  since 4@h went down EW can collect some plus|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice hand to start with|pg||
nt|royhughes: Indeed|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: Hi RV|pg||
pc|c7|nt|granguru:  yes 3NT makes easily|pg||
nt|kirp:  same result in OR|pg||
nt|kirp:  and identical auction|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|davpro: Declarer can count to 9. Lets see if he tries for more|pg||
nt|davpro: nope|pg||
nt|jbgood: he actually had 10 from the top if n really discarded 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rv: Texan Aces have a fantastic record in this event, they have won silver and bronze medals in last couple of editions|pg||
nt|rv: Zimmerman (Monaca Z) are one of the pre-tourney favorties and consist of multiple world champions|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|benjy:  and this is not the kind of board e/w will want to start off with i.e. a sure losing board|pg||
nt|othered1: auctions beginning with a reopening bid are among the most troublesome, almost regardless your system|pg||

nt|roswolf: 10 or 11 tricks operator?|pg||
nt|davpro: there was actually 12 to take (double dummie)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: solid start for the dutch|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good start|pg||
nt|roswolf: a fortuitous start for angelini|pg||
nt|roswolf: hu bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi bill:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: more spice here|pg||
nt|kirp:  1st board is not a nice way to wake up in the match|pg||
nt|kirp:  slam in @Cs available here|pg||
nt|granguru:  6NT 6@s 6@c EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  6NT best contract|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@S worst one|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think he might have done a bit better establishing clubs, but it is very complex|pg||
nt|benjy:  The only good news is that they weren't vulnerable so it won't be as expensive as it might have been|pg||
nt|benjy:  1NT from west?|pg||
nt|kingcur: test|pg||
mb|1C|nt|davpro: 10 point all around. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Peter and Murat|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello|pg||
nt|athene: without the @DA Nunes would likely have led fourth best|pg||
nt|granguru:  do u enter S?|pg||
nt|glen: W might start with Multi if that's available, or a 2@S weak two, or pass|pg||
nt|rv: North is G.Venkatesh, popularly known as Texas and based out of US, rest of team members from India|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if @Cjx or qx was with west there were chances of making |pg||
nt|benjy:  nope!|pg||
nt|benjy:  any ideas guys? apart from 11-16 and nat?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I'm sorry to admit that I don't know the system E-W are playing|pg||
nt|kingcur: welcome to the third set of this Women's semi-final match|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with 6/5 and only 1 defencive trick normally better to play in attack|pg||
nt|danilo1: strang - when we look in names here|pg||
nt|granguru:  red vs green?|pg||
nt|glen: N has a flat hand, best to pass, and it make go all pass|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk1: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 3NT - and hard work|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: perhaps east should take it away -he has got support in hearts so ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: Angelini seems to be in the A Swiss almost no matter what happens in this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a hand for n/s to bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: these guys have good nerves,but average players can shake a bit after start like this|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@C relay FG I think|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davpro: y and Mossop will need a good result to joij them|pg||
nt|roswolf: fulvio has seen his pard's bids before|pg||
nt|glen: *may go|pg||
nt|glen: S is in there with a X, not sure what the next bid would be if N bids 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  conservative pass by W|pg||
nt|royhughes: A kibitzer told me the West player's name is spelled Cem|pg||
mb|3D|nt|davpro: *join|pg||
nt|jbgood: 24 vps to Mossop |pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 from each group to A - the others to B|pg||
nt|pelu: hard decision by S - 4@H is down 1 and 5@c also down 1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c looks good|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 5@c making - only defense is @H lead and the @S - kill the entry for the 4. @D|pg||
nt|jfaria:  5! still cheap if opps bid game|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT does well on a @S lead|pg||
nt|glen: not as good on a @D lead|pg||
nt|rv: best for both sides to stay low here, all suits and cards lying wrong|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Stay low - double-dummy North might make 4 @S on a @H-lead and -ruff|pg||
nt|rv: North might bite the bullet and pass here|pg||
nt|pelu: but a make if u duck @D first time and play @C from S's hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s will prevail i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  About 12 tricks again - but lucky and only in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jxxx in @D are very much - the double by Versace means balanced hand value in @S - Zaleski can reopen|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Zapadinski is playing at both tables. Could you please check, operator?|pg||
nt|kirp:  not sure it is a relay, artificial and GF yes, now natural|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@s suit 3@C suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  Angelini deciding to bid 4@C passint the 3N barrier|pg||
mb|4C|nt|MolvaM: kibs rush in to tell me that if defence plays spades 5c cant make|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s finess off so no game on|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like game 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: then 27 from A and 5 from B go on to the KO stage|pg||
nt|davpro: They found a 6-1 fit instead of the 6-0 fit. On level higher though|pg||
nt|pelu: has to take 3x@C befor @D|pg||
nt|kirp:  no blackwood here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  wrong|pg||
mb|4D|nt|eamongall: the non-vul Townsend might venture an insurance 4@Hs |pg||
nt|jbgood: but I think a black suit or even NT play better than @ds|pg||
nt|davpro: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: some sort of short suit trial bid?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: following the law, S has passed and west has competed with 6 @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: we see all 4 hands but sometimes at the table it is not obvious to shift to spades|pg||
nt|danilo1: 5@C is on ... and good to avoid 4@H, that is tempting in 4-3 fit (single @S on 3-card side)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Lech|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but since 3 ! is a bit too high no problem for NS|pg||
nt|kingcur: Due to the large number of matches going on, you're going to have to do with less regular commentators :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: so 2@C forcing one round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best lead: @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - NORTH is declarer... - wake up|pg||
nt|pelu: yes defense has to kill @SA|pg||
nt|glen: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda7.html|pg||
nt|glen: top 27 teams in Swiss A, and top 5 in Swiss B play tomorrow|pg||
nt|glen: here we have  25 against  29 in a likely elimination match|pg||
nt|glen: W is thinking, why did my partner play the beer card (@D7)?|pg||
nt|glen: is it because of the beer garden just outside|pg||
nt|glen: it couldn't be fourth best, could it?|pg||
nt|glen: E is thinking, I led fourth best, what's the problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south wont get in much to lead trumps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would also make on the @S-lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lead small @S possible but @H equivalent - many use to overcall 1@S in West to give the lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with weak 5332 i agree to pass like Versace|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But an overcall would put the contract in South, so...|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing really helps,but contracts should have been by south this time -by n= -if spade lead,but now 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the option between @H and @S lead is a typical problem in bridge|pg||
nt|kirp:  surprise pass by both!|pg||
nt|granguru:  Angelini learns lessons..not passed this time..(as he did once with 10HCP)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|eamongall: Now defence need to get active |pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4s has good chances|pg||
nt|granguru:  HI ALL|pg||
nt|granguru:  Angelini probably showed no first red control a singleton @c support and good @s not more than 5|pg||
nt|kirp:  hard to get to NT played by E, never sure of 7th @C|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe they play their 2-bids as sound minimum openings with 6-card suit.  That's very playable in majors, but I h aven't thought through its value in @D or @C, unless to plug a ...|pg||
nt|othered1: system gap.|pg||
nt|kingcur: We're working out who's sitting who |pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: with trump Kx inside and clubs 3-3 and the @dK safe|pg||
nt|lechcold: hello|pg||
nt|rcerreto: a good 4@h, with suits splitting evenly and honours well placed... looks an easy make|pg||
nt|kingcur: but NS likely to be a Dutch pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and wont necessarily lead one anyway:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - wrong table:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe 2 |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 1 in Open - playing 5@S|pg||
nt|rv: good defense by Balicki here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Actually @D-lead would have worked better for the defense|pg||
nt|rv: @d lead might have been better for defense|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3@c|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, NS certainly do not belong at the three level and 3@c should go down|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eamongall: still time |pg||
nt|bagman: N has to duck the @HK if W plays a low heart|pg||
nt|bagman: Both N and S know that there are no spade tricks to make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even in the case of a spade shift, stuurman has to be very careful to keep all his diamonds and let his spade honor go|pg||
nt|pelu: also 3Nt in Or , but no @Dbid form East - and @H-lead from W - now easy|pg||
nt|pelu: but a strange lead @D was unbid suit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: i prefere to lead in the suit more solid, but without a solid suit i prefere the lead from small cards - but is is only a opinion|pg||
nt|jbgood: NT is more flexible than 3@d|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: They also see the clubs so they can make extra tricks only from trumps|pg||
nt|glen: spec tells me they may play 3/5 leads|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||
nt|kirp:  win 1 imp|pg||
nt|royhughes: Well judged all around, I think|pg||
nt|benjy:  with @Hs 3-2 and the @S as it is declarer won't have any problems here|pg||
nt|kingcur: either Pasman-Simons, or Michielsen-Dekkers...can you enlighten us pls, vugraph? )|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kirp:  ty, thought N would bit it|pg||
nt|granguru:  if 5@H over 5@C there was a chance...|pg||
nt|rv: maybe @SQ was better at trick 2 instead of another @c|pg||
nt|kingcur: thanks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: a stronger defence was diamond lead, heart back, then another diamond|pg||
nt|rv: now down with rounded suit overruffs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Getting to hand a problem for S, ruffing earlier @C wd have worked better|pg||
nt|rv: excellent defense by Balicki, Keyzad could have possibly scored contract if he had played @SQ at trick 2|pg||
nt|rv: on accurate defense 2 @c over-ruffs and 2 @h ruffs including @SK trump promotion|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: Open room have just got to the same contract|pg||
nt|benjy:  this seems an odd line though|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: West is Cem Tokay and not Sem|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup: ok inspite off 9 points north desided to pass 3 -right this time -perhaps 3 small trumps and too balanced nd not vulnerable  make that|pg||
nt|kirp:  stopped in 3@S in OR, |pg||
nt|runnerup: no he raised --ok|pg||
nt|toral5: back.was away|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: I don't think he can still make contract, can see only 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: an imaginative E might bid 3@c then:)|pg||
nt|glen: in which case dropping the beer card on the table was wrong|pg||
nt|rv: even if Keyzad plays @SA and @SQ, he has only 9 tricks to the best of my analyses|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kirp:  N's QJ of @Cs were too good to stop in 3|pg||
nt|runnerup: so -5|pg||
nt|kirp:  in OR, W overcalled, hence any finesse rated to lose|pg||
nt|pelu: when u have QJ x and no 10's or 9'2 normal the best play is to play up to the low H's|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|benjy:  @H to the 9 looked more normal to me|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|eamongall: At another table McGann Brown have reached the happy position of having 3 vulnerable doubled undertricks available against 4@S ...they still have to collect them |pg||
nt|kingcur: 6@C seems a good contract here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: hi john|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi john|pg||
nt|danilo1: good play .. 2 Dummy entries for (if needed) repeated @H finess|pg||
nt|rv: super defense by Balicki|pg||
nt|toral5: should try @S now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Gerben42:  going plus got to be worth something|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so far +100 is almost worth everything|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if Madala is N then S is Rimstedt|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  operator please correct S name?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: i think finesse in @C give more % at declarer|pg||
nt|toral5: low @C now means a @C blockage cos @D will be shooted|pg||
nt|toral5: @D return is good now|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR @H-lead to A and then they wait 5 min for the next card from East :) 8O. Herbst)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: the dutch duly gained 11 imps by bidding the grand|pg||
nt|kirp:  so chalk this pickup due to sound overcalls|pg||
nt|toral5: after a 1@D oc,@H ace is a marked card with jassem.so only hope for declarer is @H ace stiff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jfaria:  time to claim|pg||
pc|d6|nt|toral5: now @C are blocked|pg||

nt|runnerup: look 1nt / ns|pg||
nt|granguru:  1 imp for the overtrick|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@S EW depending on the @DK winning or not.|pg||
nt|rv: Balicki made 2 key plays, duck @CQ and return low @d when in with @SK, Keyzad still had a chance to ruff a @h and exit in @DJ instead of @CA and @c ruff|pg||
nt|toral5: no.9 only|pg||
nt|royhughes: Did South return a heart -- that looks like an error|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another double fit for both sides|pg||
nt|benjy:  8 imps away on board 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: EW are currently 4th fighting for a medal|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kirp:  the polish Club|pg||
nt|toral5: part score battle coming up|pg||
nt|jfaria:  1nt upgradable if 15-17 by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Balicki was end-played when in with @dj if Keyzad had found play|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jbgood: looks like a peaceful 3 NT by N|pg||
nt|jbgood: or S for that matter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tokay-baldursson at the open room is a very new partnership which might explain why they couldnt find the grand|pg||
nt|athene: certainly a bit of a gamble but it paid off very nicely this time|pg||
nt|runnerup: east is not tesyed because north stoles hearts|pg||
nt|granguru:  weak  by N1NT |pg||
nt|jbgood: hi all|pg||
nt|granguru:  weak 1NT by N|pg||
nt|kirp:  unlikely to get to game now|pg||
nt|glen: 2@C is likely for the majors or some other two suited convention|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like OR found the way to make this, defence not as good as here, E played @CK at trick 2|pg||
nt|rv: great hand for defense and declarer play|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  rescue redbld|pg||
nt|granguru:  may have specific types of hands|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice 1 @D - natural?|pg||
nt|rv: yes North-South play 2/1 based methods|pg||
nt|rv: East-West play Polish @c|pg||
mb|1S|nt|danilo1: looks like routine 4@H|pg||
nt|royhughes: These competitive partscore deals can be difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: normal 4 @h = with no other ideas -from anyone -looks like it ,but..|pg||
nt|granguru:  2-suited continous is one|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@c asks |pg||
nt|granguru:  2@D = @d+@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: W's pass in this context is usually forcing|pg||
nt|jbgood: but not sure with angelini|pg||
nt|granguru:  accepting 1NT xx eventually|pg||
nt|rv: Zmud has passed judiciously before Venkatesh started doubling|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kirp:  E should dble 2@C|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Rimsted clearly gambling with her heart suit|pg||
nt|davpro: yes. 9 easy tricks, but not the best communications...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 nt - 2 @h - 2 NT - 3 NT?|pg||
nt|toral5: what would have been a dbl by martens on 2h?|pg||
nt|toral5: never penalties.right?|pg||
nt|lechcold: heart lead was devastating for declarer, but impossible to find|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|kingcur: I know little of the systems either pair play, so experts on the balcony are welcome to coach me here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  some would call it practical :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all colors taked by weak players :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North bid both, @D and @H|pg||
nt|jfaria:  another routine game|pg||
nt|kirp:  a @H lead is not good for defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  N has 3 trix in the suit|pg||
nt|kirp:  as now S can pass|pg||
nt|rv: I presume the first 2 deals had an effect on Keyzad to open this hand, he might have not opened normally|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 2 flat also -1|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and so will reach 4@S|pg||
nt|royhughes: If it is a partscore -- NS might make more|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: misfit hand but contract seems makable|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible here perhaps|pg||
nt|jfaria:  at least for us looking at 4 hands|pg||
nt|kirp:  this will challenge N in the play|pg||
nt|granguru:  took his time |pg||
nt|jbgood: but again - this prdship is not of very firm construction - so ....|pg||
nt|granguru:  he "knew" S was going to say 2@d|pg||
nt|jfaria:  i believe they will bid 4|pg||
nt|kingcur: regular 3N|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  Poor North - he thinks, he is facing an opening bid...|pg||
nt|lechcold: now 9 tricks I think|pg||
nt|toral5: is he making?|pg||
nt|kingcur: 10 tricks in view when playing for @cs dropping|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: 6@S would not be great here even with the @D9|pg||
nt|kirp:  @Ds are sitting wrong or maybe right given lack of entries to N|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all, warm regards from sunny Bangalore|pg||
nt|kingcur: Michielsen probably thinking through what to continue when in with @DA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|athene: the point being, on a club lead, you have to draw trumps and then cash four hearts to discard a club from the north hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: they might go down here|pg||
nt|glen: declarer knows where the @S ace, but where is the @S jack|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 x 16 in the finals on Wednesday|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the first non-alert after 3 rounds of bidding :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N hand looks nothing like minimum to play in @s |pg||
nt|jfaria:  both rooms thought the same|pg||
nt|rcerreto: hi|pg||
nt|benjy:  hi|pg||
nt|kingcur: Marion Michielsen's partnership with Laura Dekkers is fairly new, since she broke up with Meike Wortel. Laura Dekkers is considered on of the talents of young women bridge players ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: in Holland|pg||
nt|kingcur: Bessis-d'Ovidio need no further introduction, I presume|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: N should know that the @c king counts for full - and bid 3 imo|pg||
nt|kirp:  S is happy|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Rodolfo|pg||
nt|rcerreto: a trump lead could have worked better|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Ben and all specs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davpro: They stopped low, but if @ds are not 3-3 a higher contract would be a struggle|pg||
nt|kirp:  now N has a problem|pg||
nt|granguru:  a terrible contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: W will not be|pg||
nt|kirp:  100 a trick|pg||
nt|kirp:  i make down 3|pg||
nt|granguru:  1@s 2@h 2@D 1@c|pg||
nt|granguru:  but may be only -2|pg||
nt|jbgood: E should ask himself why E didnt jump in hearts (or bid them directly) - because he had 2 suits:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  not easy lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|danilo1: @CQ lead may create some playing options ... cashing 2 @H immediatelly may be loosing option|pg||
nt|granguru:  if @c help to discard|pg||
nt|rv: I might have slightly devalued and re-opened 1n with North hand instead of double of 1@s|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I think the North cards are very suitable|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|granguru:  now -2 as said|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|benjy:  Well that would have been more normal, but on a club force this may be as good if not better|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: although the bidding thus far is cloaked in mystery they seem to be powering into it|pg||
nt|kingcur: The Dutch had a very good second set, after having been down 38-13 (I think) after the first|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Gerben42:  with a bit more fortune it would have been a claimer|pg||
nt|bagman: In pairs it might not be that practical as the bonus for the game is not that big as in teams|pg||
nt|granguru:  no no|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  S ruffs @cq but loses a natural trump trick |pg||
nt|granguru:  no fast entry in S hand to cross @D|pg||
nt|glen: odds are still the 1NT bidder has it, so he picks up the trump suit|pg||
nt|glen: E can win this or the next to switch to @Ds for his ruff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: duck this @D could be a idea|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gives the same result, if South plays safe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but give at south the chance to fault|pg||
nt|danilo1: well done|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S MIGHT BE FINIS|pg||
nt|roswolf: and it is not sure what happened there|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at the other table, tokay asked for keycards and then asked for the trump queen apparently. why??|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well if u open the north hand 1@C a 1 NT rebid wd be a gross underbid... so open 1 nt|pg||
nt|royhughes: The lie of the cards is very friendly to declarer|pg||
nt|rv: Texan Aces have caused a sensation beating one of the big favorites Monaco Zimmerman in R32|pg||
nt|rcerreto: a force play would allow for 2 ruffs in dummy and 4 trumps in the closed hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  Absolutely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on the previous board|pg||
nt|athene: actually i guess it would be ok (provided the hearts come in)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: 27 teams from A and 5 from B go to the KO stage - with no carry over|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye is used to playing tough contracts - but most often there is a glimmer of hope to win:) not so here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: the @D-lead gave S a fine tempo|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kirp:  that looks like 6 trix for declarer|pg||
nt|granguru:  19 teams are playing for Poland|pg||
nt|rcerreto: adding 3 aces...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s4|pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: west was somewhat stuck for a good lead|pg||
nt|pelu: 110 = 9 IMP for Monaco|pg||
nt|runnerup: trying to help parner well done -now surely down|pg||
nt|jfaria:  maybe leading the singleton with 4 trumps not hte best choice|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jfaria:  claim is near|pg||
nt|rcerreto: oh well|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally Texan Aces have won bronze and silver medals in last couple of editions of this event, their love affair with this event seems to be enduring|pg||
nt|rcerreto: nice guess by Pattacini|pg||
nt|benjy:  if he had covered then the 5@H would have come into the game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|toral5: on a trump lead may be he was down 2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|glen: sorry, her ruff|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kingcur: going for a safe 9, it looks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kirp:  so it is down 3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|benjy:  Now making in comfort|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: the point is that you create swings when you dont bid games on 26 combined |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|rv: now @S shift and I can see 3 more tricks for defense|pg||
nt|rcerreto: their names makes me thinking of your country fellows Venky|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|davpro: To be fair against N. 2N from S was perhaps a bit low (aswell)|pg||
nt|kirp:  another 5 imps for EW|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|jbgood: I am sure this wil be a game swing for Angelini|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|granguru:  better would have been to duck second @h into N hand|pg||
nt|rcerreto: rather than 'texans'|pg||

nt|kingcur: reached*|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  7@S in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: same defence in other room |pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3rd slam hand in a row?|pg||

nt|athene: well, whether he can or not, he didn't|pg||
nt|lechcold: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or32runda1.html|pg||
nt|pelu: running score : http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or32runda1.html but no scores yet from 2. segment|pg||
nt|toral5: no slam makes here|pg||
nt|toral5: with a combined strength of 33|pg||
nt|pelu: 32 :)|pg||
nt|toral5: ouch.@S jack hiding for me:(|pg||
nt|toral5: what is 2nt opening for ew?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2 very flat hands, so no good play for 6NT (6@c)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  normal @d lead|pg||
nt|jfaria:  and N has litle options to win|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will leap high|pg||
nt|MolvaM: leader board and running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: but is it high enough|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you redouble in these auctions you help opps because they now have more room to scramble for the best fit|pg||
nt|toral5: seems they play 2nt opening=minors weak|pg||
nt|pelu: polish @c here|pg||
nt|royhughes: Difficult hand -- it may be interesting to see if declarer can get to dummy with the spade 10|pg||
nt|rcerreto: W's pass on E's 1@h seems to confirm they're playing some sort of big club system|pg||
nt|benjy:  but then north reopened with 1NT?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: but defense may start with 3 spades and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where south needs discipline|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW play a strong @C, so this shows points|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect North bid 1@s and not 1n|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: not any more|pg||
nt|davpro: 8 quick tricks for defense here on a spade lead. 7 for declarer on that lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 7 th in the bag|pg||
nt|athene: also you warn them with borderline hands to stay low|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S WHATEVER IT MEANS SEEM OVER THE TOP - WEST SHAPENS HIS AXE|pg||
nt|athene: so here for example if west had redoubled, south might well have decided his partner didn't have what was needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: sharpens|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@c must be @d |pg||
nt|benjy:  i think so too|pg||
mb|3N|nt|MolvaM: lets see if they can locate the missing @d control|pg||
nt|roswolf: they should do|pg||
nt|roswolf: the flexible double|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch is comming|pg||
nt|toral5: did he really bid 3nt with 21?|pg||
nt|lechcold: I believe Martens-Jassem play strong club when NV|pg||
nt|pelu: well done by Martens - Jassem hasa absolut max for a passed hand|pg||
nt|benjy:  else 2@H makes no sense|pg||
nt|rv: South's 2@h would be good raise in @s|pg||
nt|rcerreto: N's 1NT would be weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer needs to ruff the heart losers and discard a club on a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  UNDO|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade honors not so attractive for madala|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well be passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has nothing to cue and has soft club values|pg||
nt|rcerreto: which he has|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kirp:  I think pass followed ny pass or 3N would have been better bid by E|pg||
nt|rv: this could be one of the worst possible draw for Texan Aces, they started tourney very well and topped their group consisting of Bessis, Payne and qualified for Swiss A with 3 VPs ...|pg||
nt|rv: c/o|pg||
nt|royhughes: He has finesses in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|rcerreto: -1 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: they dont have a lot of hcp to spare|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR NS in 6@H - looks like S gave a false cue bid in @D - but it was an artifical bidding over 6 round|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow thats enterprising|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think the italians are merciful|pg||
nt|kirp:  not well bid here|pg||
nt|kirp:  thought this was a strong club auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: most pairs have bid to 7 - but a few rested in six, and even fewer in game|pg||
nt|glen: this lead will not trouble declarer too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: in another table north could go with J2N and that might be a problem|pg||
nt|danilo1: exactelly ... if Alfredo decides to try more than 4@S ... he will not bid Diamonds :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I believe 4@C was just cue|pg||
nt|jfaria:  456 kibs tell me 4@c is just a cue |pg||
nt|jfaria:  being a cue, no way to reach @d :(|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Not likely as we only have 285 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i am told they are in slam in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he still likes his hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  just a figure of speach :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: NS have done very well to enter bidding ... if South pass, EW would have time to find @D |pg||
nt|benjy:  yes|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|rcerreto: hi|pg||
nt|benjy:  hi|pg||
pc|h8|nt|MolvaM: well even if diamonds are not led. no way to get rid of the 2 losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: and that is enough for norberto:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: does 4s have any specific meaning?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just an old fashioned cue?|pg||
nt|rv: they lost a bit of steam in Swiss A with lacklustre performance and could finish only 21st with 107 VPs after 7 rounds, that performance has contributed tough draw here|pg||
nt|kingcur: this lead gives declarer a few extra finesse options, assuming the lead is from doubleton|pg||
nt|kingcur: but two tricks in either red suit seem hard to avoid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup: no fight now just posible over tricks |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i want to bid on and i have a spade control|pg||
nt|roswolf: the latter|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems an easy-ish make|pg||
nt|rv: Venkatesh can afford to go 1 down since E-W can upto 150 in @d partial|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: The @DA must be with E: if W has it, then E has the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But how can you play bridge - NOT leading partners suit with Ace-x???|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You MUST have seen too many bad overcalls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: try both finesses and hope that the @d10 takes care of itself|pg||
nt|roswolf: the pass of 4@S said dont lead one i am told:) so he follows his own suggestion:)|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Glen Ashton|pg||
nt|glen: hi|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hard to tell probably Lauria would treat is hand as single suited..|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: may be able to get @S entry for a rounded suit fin|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|pelu: very controles bidding here|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe enough here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's concern on a diamond shift is whether to finesse the @C9|pg||
nt|roswolf: now off|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: but i don't think he will|pg||
nt|benjy:  tough for east to bid again when partner passed 1@H|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Happy Christmas now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: push hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks srange but no spade losers went away |pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps has been a better idea to pass and wait for partners d --but ofcause partner can pass too -but if y double partner never bids nt -because you have all spades|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he may get to dummy yes|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is a tough choice for declarer -- he does not want to lose a heart finesse here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now he has 2 hooks available|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but only chance to keep|pg||
nt|royhughes: If he wins the jack and plays a low spade, it looks like he can make it|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|glen: now careful not to use the @S Queen too early|pg||
nt|glen: 3@S + 2@H + 2@C + 2@D = making|pg||
nt|rv: in the last couple of editions of this event where they won silver and bronze resp, they did have favorable draws atleast in the initial k/o matches|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: as suggested Angeline bid and made 3 NT on the previous one|pg||
pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: I wont lead one :)|pg||
nt|athene: he might be considering whether to try to make the contract by playing east for the @HK|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but east's double is a warning|pg||
nt|danilo1: as I said before ... on Bd 12 - 4@H in 4-3 fit has been very tempting ... happened in OR - and 12 IMP for Allfrey|pg||
nt|rv: namaste good afternoon Panjaji (assuming you are in UK)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Glen|pg||
nt|glen: hi Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade best for defense now|pg||
nt|rcerreto: had W bid 1NT...|pg||
nt|benjy:  I never know when one is supposed to pass 1NT with shape and some values|pg||
nt|rcerreto: like it will happen in OR if they play natural|pg||
nt|benjy:  when playing a strong @C system|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: good defense to save an IMP|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jbgood: strange that N didnt try a big spade first...|pg||
nt|roswolf: draw trumps and take the diamonf hook|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can pull trumps and discard diamonds on clubs to ruff out the king|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which also works|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jfaria:  there he goes, "litle option" came alive |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|glen: it takes a long time for "spade best" to go from Canada to Poland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes this is a very tough draw for them|pg||
nt|kingcur: so, down 1 likely, and equally likely a flat board|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|nt|benjy:  we may find that south bids over 1@H|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wondering if he can throw E in for a club trick|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tough def for west... best wd have been to return @S... passive|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|davpro: y|pg||
nt|glen: declarer heading for home with 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kingcur: one more imp to the Dutch on  3, with the @S lead giving declarer 10 tricks|pg||

nt|bagman: NS can make a minor suit slam|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe EW have some Namyats type of device over 1m openings|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3N-2 was only worth 20%|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  last round not finished yet?|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can show real clubs, S hand becomes very valuable with the source of tricks, heart control and trump support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if it starts 1@C 4@H, what does S bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4NT perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: but E has a hand where she can prevent NS from changing that information. After 1@C, E can bid 4@H and then?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. tough if 1@C can be short (3 or even 2 cards)|pg||
nt|bagman: if 4NT shows primary diamonds and secondary clubs then it's the bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the problem with such a bid is - what will pd think it is|pg||
nt|bagman: I wouldn't be surprised if there are some other agreements for the meaning of 4NT|pg||
nt|bagman: or no agreements :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is an area where regular partnerships are ahead of the game|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@HX is 500; it's better than the vulnerable game for EW so they might take the sac|pg||
nt|runnerup: 11 in both tables and we though how to make 10|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me slam makable if no @d lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well if you can duck a diamond and then squeeze somebody afterwards :) maybe|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not sure if this play was superior|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: for running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: south could make 6 of a red suit here if only he could get to dummy twice (lead the @H7 picks the suit up)|pg||
nt|roswolf: there will be some fun and games here|pg||
nt|athene: sorry - of course he can do it|pg||
nt|athene: lead to @SA, and lead the small heart|pg||
nt|athene: then later get to dummy with a heart and lead a diamond to the queen|pg||
nt|athene: easy!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm perhaps not at the table -in the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: only needs east to have @HHx and @DKx|pg||
nt|roswolf: game not reached at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: hampson-greco playing precision so 1@D is nebulous|pg||
nt|athene: south can be very aggressive if he knows his partner actually has some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but not when it might just be two small|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed these kind of hands are horrible for strong club systems|pg||
nt|roswolf: or less bill|pg||
nt|athene: well it's at least a doubleton for them i think; they use 2@D for the short diamond hands|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: Nunes call director|pg||
nt|roswolf: short of bds!?or something wrong with the last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: becouse 2nt invit or forsing |pg||
nt|athene: hmmm - they are not happy about something from the previous board, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: ah - you mean nunes was told that 2NT was showing a good hand and that is why he didn't double?|pg||
nt|danilo1: this is anothe swing possibility|pg||
nt|danilo1: meant 6@D (@S)|pg||
nt|kirp:  score is really 25-10|pg||
nt|granguru:  a very expensive hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  which will most probably decide the winner of the match |pg||
nt|fabsayc: our postal system on rotating strikes|pg||
nt|glen: next door the other room tried the 5-2 @S fit, and ran into the 5-1 trump split|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Weak 2 from N?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hope not...!|pg||
nt|royhughes: and 6 imps toNS|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect South won't bid 2@c over 1@h esp at these colors, I am fairly certain West wll bid 1n in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  something to be said for 5@H overcall too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in 4@H in other match one made one down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  5 @D N/S should end the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: wont make much difference anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns has a good score open room ew has some 2h to make|pg||
nt|rv: they need to strike in the first segment when Zimmerman is playing, no disrespect, but Helgemo-Helness is mch tougher proposition in second segment |pg||
mb|1C|nt|MolvaM: if trumps were 3-1 he would have to fall back on the @d hook|pg||
nt|granguru:  1 NT 13-15|pg||
nt|glen: that was 10 imps, bring this "elimination" match to a near tie|pg||
nt|jfaria:  partscore here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: against a strong 1@C 5@H would be fine|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt also,but ew can bid more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We have seen such hand make 2 @H - and 6 @C...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: 4@S here is the likely spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart partial would be sensible|pg||
nt|toral5: very thin 1@S oc|pg||
nt|toral5: but very common these days.5332 is often ignored:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@S very normal - would u pass? :)|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.i pass:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: being non vul... dont think EW will push|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: 5@D can be beated with @S lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: no just loose that|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: small from table |pg||
nt|jbgood: some lucky day you make 6 @s on this lot - but not today|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt now? :) - he does have seven stoppers in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: the diamond suit now consigned to the dustbin|pg||
nt|athene: i bet a lot of partnerships don't know what a jump in 4th suit means|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. 3@D here - is that natural forcing, natural non-forcing, or what?|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is wrong with a natural 1@D RESPONSE?|pg||
nt|glen: peaceful 4@h here|pg||
nt|danilo1: NS need to stop on time (5@H still on time) ... ev. 4@S or 5@D by EW will be too expensive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3@d ends any slam mess in N/S intentions|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 3@h with North hand, here Venkatesh had bid 3@h as fit jump showing @hs+@cs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes shows the benefit of Muiderberg stle 2 suiter openings|pg||
nt|mcarroll: style|pg||
nt|jfaria:  best to play in @d|pg||
nt|fokal: who would pass with S hand ?|pg||
nt|fokal: on 1 @c |pg||
nt|kingcur: aggressive 2@D at this vul by Michielsen|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  should make this for push|pg||
nt|runnerup: true ew can not tough clubs so looser gous so @s later|pg||
nt|rv: I don't like to pass with such shapely hands with most of values in my longest suit, 3@h opening for me even at these colors |pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: south is sensible|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west also :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would have been interesting to watch 3@dX|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever bids a strong 7-card minor if they have a major of any description|pg||
nt|pelu: I am know as a solid overcaller - and I would bid 1@S 100 out of 100 - take the 1. level from opp nd suit ok|pg||
nt|kingcur: werkt thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: after pass at 5@C @S lead became possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lightner...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S ruff, K @C - declarer lose the ruff, one @C and A@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup he had the colors to help him|pg||
nt|athene: i think officially in SAYC a jump in 4th suit is defined as natural and invitational|pg||
nt|glen: ok, a quiet 5@H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@H must be a fit jump|pg||
nt|jfaria:  nt looks hugly with @h lead|pg||
nt|fokal: .....|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: ok wrong hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No right hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many pair use pass at 5@C like OK to lead @C, instead DBL means to lead in another suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i don't know the gadget played by E/W|pg||
nt|jbgood: investigating for a club contract (slam?) and got no reaction of a positive kind |pg||
nt|jfaria:  now 7 tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: so it was all academical|pg||
nt|glen: 1@H likely a transfer to @S, 1NT may have denied 3+@Ss|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you are going to play transfer advances, i think you have to open west hand with 1@D (polish+walsh style)|pg||
nt|toral5: i am an old book student of sound over calls|pg||
nt|benjy:  I'm not implying that one should, i wouldn't, but you never know|pg||
nt|fokal: a double by bessis might have been expensive|pg||
nt|kingcur: I'm getting some well appreciated help from Olivier, welcome|pg||
nt|fokal: hi ! :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, could have been expensive in 2@Dx|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bagman: Malinowski has very little defense and can hope that they go down only 3|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of those dark corners that no-one knows about|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1-5-7-0 will not be an obvious shape to the defenders|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is close however since singleton spade is an honour|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Then just face the facts - open 1 @H in North|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: how to lead @H|pg||
nt|jfaria:  for ntrumpers|pg||
nt|rcerreto: tough lead problem|pg||
nt|rcerreto: not solved at best|pg||
nt|fokal: inteas going to play a wierd 2@h when 5@c might have been a good game too|pg||
nt|fokal: well not realy, not enough tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: @SK to the ace, diamond finesse i guess|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess will not miss the jead after bidding :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  this should make 5, for no swing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: now np|pg||
nt|MolvaM: trump lead effective stop a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni might stick the @DK in|pg||
nt|roswolf: but north made a normal if aggressive raise to the vul game|pg||
nt|danilo1: *lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs - if u know EW-bidding then help us :)|pg||
nt|glen: the Qx of @C here is a help to 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the spade lead from north is strange however|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bagman: Good time to take the save; in pairs taking an 800 save against a making slam is not a way to win; normally you should take your chances and try to beat the slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: @d cue was what S did NOT want to get|pg||
nt|granguru:  last hand N knowing p had 4@s cards misvalued his hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now you were unable to tll partner, that you had such a suit|pg||
nt|rv: good start by Zmud here, best to force dummy in @s|pg||
nt|fokal: inteas=instead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|davpro: But from Ns view; doesn't it seem as if S hasn't got a @h cue?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: now declarer is worried the @DQ might get ruffed, so he would like to lead a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: but entries are a bit on the short side|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kingcur: Michielsen probably seduced into bidding because she was also looking at 4hearts...that increases chances of finding partner with something useful in @D. But not this time|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jbgood: N looks to take no notice...|pg||
nt|jbgood: S bid well - N somewhat undiciplined - slam is more like a Roland one (which in the old days would be called a Norwegian slam)|pg||
nt|kirp:  q@C next?|pg||
nt|kirp:  knows S has another @S, so needs to take out entry|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|davpro: This could take a while, but will end with 1 down...|pg||
nt|jbgood: If N has the @c Q in stead of the @d Q his hand would be better though|pg||
nt|benjy:  a @S lead would have been interesting|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bagman: (unless the slam is such that everybody bids and makes it)|pg||
nt|pelu: also here, but if u pass this N's hand u sh find another game :):)|pg||
nt|toral5: agree pelu.thats y i m learning chess|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: when you have a hand like south's, your worst nightmare is getting forced, losing trump control|pg||
nt|glen: spec notes this board played in 6@D by Lavazza, and is also 6@D by Kamras|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|rcerreto: even A@d could have worked maybe|pg||
nt|rcerreto: definitely not the @cA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: 2 slams equalized the score|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 4 "H seems to be NO winner, @S Ace and a small @S|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@S very normal, 10HCP, quite good intermediates in Spades|pg||
nt|toral5: may be @S shift by north wd have beaten this|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: this is on track|pg||
nt|granguru:  expected some losed points in @C..|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|fokal: well done discarding the @d queen|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, making the best out of a poor looking contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|glen: Kamras made 6@D, thanks to Qx of @Cs, how about Lavazza?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|jbgood: another swing for Angelini i reckon|pg||
nt|athene: if things go badly wrong you can end up an embarrassingly large number down|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|granguru:  lost..sorry|pg||

nt|bridge_one: in other room the auction was different, so the lead was @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice major fits around the table|pg||
nt|jbgood: I may just have to stand corrected - i am told that Angelini in the OR also bid to 6 @s|pg||

nt|MolvaM: leader board and running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@c is normally in Pre a trump ask|pg||

nt|rv: another big swing for Monaco Z here, Texan Aces have to stem the rot quickly|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Are you the only Bessis not playing, Oliv?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: the (small) price you pay for support DBL's|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S seems to be good here|pg||

nt|Walddk1: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda5.html  running now|pg||
nt|granguru:  8-10 usually |pg||
nt|rv: I think in last deal, Texas could have bit 4@h on the way to 5@c|pg||
nt|rv: good @c slam for N-S, will they get there?|pg||
nt|benjy:  if north opens 2NT perhaps?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 8 or 9 card suits are getting common|pg||
nt|kingcur: board  4 3 imps to the French, with Cronier only 1 off|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|roswolf: this could be colorful|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@Hs went down in OR, looks close to making|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: wlc back Roy|pg||
mb|1D|nt|MolvaM: 2d alerted?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yeah @D:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok means no 4 card spades|pg||
nt|rv: no harm in telling Keyzad that he had good 6 bagger|pg||
nt|toral5: !G game is safe from souths hand|pg||
nt|toral5: @H|pg||
nt|pelu: do u know NT-range by NS? |pg||
nt|toral5: kib says 15-16|pg||
nt|rv: North may well upgrade and open, some may prefer 1@s with control rich hand|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|bridge_one: 3@H for N/S and 3@S for E/W here|pg||
nt|runnerup: may end for double partscore swing|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks kibs|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they use 1NT to show 4 spades +a longer minor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Im told zmud-bal play the raptor convention |pg||
nt|roswolf: west has an automatic 4@S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe invented by a mr raptor? :)|pg||
nt|pelu: par-contract is 6@d - 5@s and 5@d making|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west thinks abt how many spades to bid?|pg||
nt|pelu: red against green 4@S is fine|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s comphrensively outbid the americans on the last one|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes better actually -was down anyway |pg||
nt|kirp:  this is all str @C, negative 1@D |pg||
nt|benjy:  tough to diagnose the lack of @H wastage though|pg||
nt|othered1: south's response will be the key to getting to or missing slam|pg||
nt|kingcur: 1@H for @ss|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: 2@H open probably 10/12 constructive (and 2@D multi)|pg||
nt|davpro: When preempting with 3 in a minor you normally do not have a 4 card major. Nothing said about 5 card suits :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: even on 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jbgood: hehe|pg||
nt|roswolf: DBL presumably just shows cards|pg||

nt|szalay:  hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: and here a thin 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@D can be alternate suits that is @D+@S|pg||
nt|granguru:  more @d |pg||
nt|granguru:  S knows finesse is not working. can establish @C but no fast entry to dummy|pg||
nt|granguru:  to throw @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so Roy cud have come back later hu Joao|pg||
nt|jfaria:  wlc b didnt loose much :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Here is a typical defensive bidding problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well now judgment comes into it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 level belongs to the opps :)|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to decide on 5-level|pg||
nt|roswolf: south tempted to bid 6?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zmud cant be sure of void spades so will probably pass|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C natural (ish), strong (ish) and forcing|pg||
nt|szalay:  N-S are a rare pair from Hungary: they r not from Budapest|pg||
nt|szalay:  from our Sun City, Szeged, and could improve a lot thx to BBO|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Are you saying people don't play bridge outside Budapest?|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told 15-17 - and then N's hand = 1NT|pg||
nt|toral5: but barring this hand.lol|pg||
nt|toral5: south PLEASE dont DUCK @D|pg||
nt|pelu: but here Sapan: I would never overcall 1@D|pg||
nt|toral5: thank u pelu:)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 6@c is very good|pg||
nt|othered1: And 1N, assuming it's nothing special in their methods, should kill it.|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 3NT is not|pg||
nt|benjy:  wonder what 2NT is?|pg||
nt|benjy:  well if south bids 5@C now|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Laura Dekkers is amazingly talented; she started to play bridge some four, five years ago|pg||
nt|kingcur: Dbl by E likely showing hearts|pg||
nt|fokal: why wouldn't S bid NT ?|pg||
nt|kingcur: 11 count a bit thin maybe?|pg||
nt|kingcur: N more likely to make a move over 1N than over 2@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: for sure W cant bid 5@s - but I have been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  4@S looks like a strange bid?|pg||
nt|toral5: hopefully he will play @C properly|pg||
nt|toral5: match getting closer;only 2 imp deficit|pg||
nt|toral5: @D duck will be fatal|pg||
nt|toral5: now 1 imp|pg||
nt|royhughes: I see you guys managed fine without me :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  failing to bid 1nt  W got trouble|pg||
nt|royhughes: West doubled despite the short diamonds, and East just chose to bid his longest suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dont blame him... i wd dbl too|pg||
nt|benjy:  then north could raise?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Michielsen loves her Qx in Clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Having showed 44 majors and getting no reaction from partner, W could show his 3 card support expecting to be in a decent trump suit|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s will prevail |pg||
nt|runnerup: strange bidding to worse game but mames now|pg||
nt|kirp:  strangely enuff, its cold|pg||
nt|kirp:  now with the lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  play 3 trumps, then finesse in @Cs for @D pitch|pg||
nt|kirp:  good bid by E!!!|pg||
nt|kirp:  S is wondering how to keep down undertrix|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't fault EW -- it's a matter of style|pg||
nt|jfaria:  and passing 2@d?|pg||
nt|royhughes: My preference is to pass the West cards|pg||
nt|royhughes: on the first round, I mean.  He has to pass 2@d|pg||
nt|jfaria:  after E pass ther is a case for passing too|pg||
nt|fokal: played by S it seems 3NT is makable|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: If anybody is following a pair you can find their probable table from the following |pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye may lead a club now and get a plus score ag 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it was the @C position which influenced him more|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much to the play the club ace is right or it isnt:)|pg||
nt|athene: if west invites, east might bid it on the strength of the good club suit, even though he is minimum in terms of hcp|pg||
nt|szalay:  not really, they r from Szeged and few pairs from Pecs|pg||
nt|rv: North's 2n is artificial showing 3 hand types a) 18-19 balb) 5-5 (14)15-16 c) single suiter @s 18+ GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: S wants to compete but the majors are behind her so she gives up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@C help ,,, opps |pg||
nt|toral5: oh my god|pg||
nt|pelu: at many tables played by N (1Nt and tranfer) - down on @C-lead|pg||
nt|toral5: why this duck?|pg||
nt|benjy:  so that hand is far too strong for 18/19 bal|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I agree|pg||
nt|rv: South knew North is unlikely to have 5@s+5@c 14-16, hence his 3@c bid:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|szalay:  Hungary is more or less Budapest orientated, bridge is even centralized|pg||
nt|athene: difficult lead problem for south|pg||
nt|glen: should be three aces and a trump|pg||
nt|runnerup: in other table declarer took advantise off that same lead to put @d looser away ,but lost control because 4-1 and K -offside in @h contract|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S works well here on the 3-3 @S breat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rather tame bidding|pg||
nt|glen: break|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As always - trump-lead|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but if any i would bid 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: methods seem to be pretty sound, but south is still facing taking a shot at slam|pg||
nt|rcerreto: might N raise?|pg||
nt|fokal: by N , @h lead might beat even 2NT|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: If S had rebid 1 NT the same contract would have been reached|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: OK|pg||
nt|roswolf: the clubs can of course be set up here for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H - 4@D - 4@S - 5@D and 51S by Helgemo!|pg||
nt|pelu: 15 INP to Monaco |pg||
nt|MolvaM: no so easy if east ducks|pg||
nt|athene: north could have made life easier, perhaps, by doubling 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: but he finds the heart anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: some play a double of these transfer responses as some sort of takeout double anyway|pg||
nt|athene: for example after nebulous 1@C - 1@H [spades], X = diamonds and hearts, and 1@S = clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
nt|athene: but without special agreements of that sort i would have thought double would just be hearts and 1@S would be takeout, the same as after a transfer over 1nt|pg||
nt|szalay:  Mr. Zsak is teacher of Szeged bridge, he was teacher of Mr. Cseho of other table when he attended Faculty of Medicine there. as u know: he is my psychiatrist:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  unless E thinks playing for a simple @H finesse is better option!|pg||
nt|granguru:  a deceptive move|pg||
nt|glen: now Benito might or might not lead his singleton @D here|pg||
nt|glen: @D lead, A, @D ruff, @H to the Q, and rats, that's ruffed!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: his rule is a bit too rigid to be the absolute truth|pg||
nt|glen: we were out in the beer garden when the TD came by to get us all back in this match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice @C9|pg||
nt|fokal: leading a @d with 9 points and two aces is a bit wierd, since her partner didn't bid 2D over 2 @c|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru:  but defense is obvious|pg||
nt|rv: frozen @d suit, can't see a way for Zmud to make this |pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - but often opponents find the way...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dummy itÂ´s lay-down|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 6@h a good save over 4@s:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: spade ace and a club takes it 1 down|pg||
nt|davpro: Defense better take their tricks at once...|pg||
nt|danilo1: 140 I believe|pg||
nt|royhughes: I am not convinced anyone has the absolute right answer to these problems|pg||
nt|rcerreto: no|pg||
nt|rv: South did well to bid 5@c instead of languishing in 3n|pg||
nt|benjy:  I doubt that they have discussed the difference between 3@C then 5@C and a direct 5@C|pg||
nt|rv: their methods were not good enough to bid slam accurately|pg||
nt|benjy:  personally i think that a direct 5@C should imply that you don't care what partner has|pg||
nt|rcerreto: N has very good controls but bidding 6 would be undisciplined|pg||
nt|rcerreto: (but worth many imps)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: north really bid his hand to the limit:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27 teams from group-A will qualify for the knockouts. and 5 teams from group-B|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might try ducking in dummy and dropping the @H10 to induce north to lay down the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: but that would only work if south would lead the @H9 from @H9xx|pg||
nt|szalay:  as u know: we, Hungarians try to avoid D lead vs NT|pg||
nt|athene: D = doubleton or diamond?|pg||
nt|szalay:  diamond|pg||
nt|rv: Anklesaria can duck this, win @HK and play @SA and @ST to prevent any mess-up on normal line of play|pg||
nt|jfaria:  of c|pg||
nt|benjy:  I agree, i think it is very tough to bid slam after a 1@S opener|pg||
nt|othered1: I like methods that let me bid 2@C on south's hand, rebidding them non-forcing, if that's what seems right.  2/1 absolute game force has some holes in it.|pg||
nt|rcerreto: absolutely|pg||
pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: 15 how? 5s cant be made I think|pg||
nt|jfaria:  peacefull partscore|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You see...|pg||
nt|fokal: yes, but not from the sam hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eamongall: We are covering tables 8-15 as shown  on the results web page ... so the bottom 8 lines are tables H G F E A B C D in that order |pg||
nt|jbgood: @s 6 for a club now|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbgood: Boye should be able to read that|pg||
nt|roswolf: and probably on this layout so can 6@D|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: agree, small H looks much better|pg||
nt|kingcur: that switch helps|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: declarer can't untangle his black suits here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You look around the table - and you take your decision|pg||
nt|rv: terrible start by Key-Texas here, each bad result and being on Vu-graph is adding up|pg||
nt|benjy:  i play 2/1 GF but i would be debating about what to bid over a 2NT opening, think i would show a single suited slam try and if pd denied a @H control then i would bid a slam|pg||
nt|othered1: If south can bid 2@C, even if it can be a mere sign-off with long @C, north will think of slam, somewhere, immediately|pg||
nt|rv: if North had opened 2n, there was small chance for N-S to get to slam if South shows @c suit mild slam try on which North will cue 4@d followed by 4@h cue by South (key bid)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|szalay:  Diamonds for girls, u know|pg||
nt|granguru:  S is trying that EW moves @S |pg||

pc|c3|nt|eamongall: this is table 13 of 15 in play tables and 3rd line from bottom of scoresheet |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbgood: but difficult to think that prd has 5 spades (and a @c void...)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if he unblocks the @SAK he can't get to his clubs|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm just chicken|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: sorry 5@S down 1 - so only 7 IMP|pg||
nt|szalay:  time for hoping up|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can all see @DK, heart gets the job done|pg||
nt|athene: but not so easy for south|pg||
nt|szalay:  I dont see any layout when small is the correct card|pg||
nt|athene: his partner might have singleton @DQ for example|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed not|pg||
nt|szalay:  he knows pd's cards|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bagman: Now E can ruff the diamond and try the heart to the K|pg||
nt|eamongall: Most pairs move to the table of the pair below them next ... ie 12 goes where 11 used to be |pg||
nt|rv: I presume Zmud guessed right since if DA is with Kezad, @hk is likely to be with Venkatesh|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jbgood: no - then the 7 for his known strenth|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, when you're in 2N, your hopes have to be that other room fails in 3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|glen: interesting line, requires N to have two or less @Hs, and @D ace|pg||
nt|glen: if will cash @S ace here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but what does it gain against|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|roswolf: well THE RESULT IN THE OTHER ROOM SPEAKS FOT ITSELF|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: amazingly 5s was made. cant see how|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the 2NT bid denied four diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jfaria:  so with waht hand would u bid 1nt?|pg||
nt|royhughes: From West's point of view, 2@d didn't have to be a bad contract -- partner might have had longer diamonds|pg||
nt|royhughes: I like my vul 1NT overcalls to be 16-19, stronger than most people play, especially when partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: Also AK8 of hearts isn't as nice as something like KJx|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well said Roy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jbgood: nobody would give style points for this defense|pg||
nt|royhughes: There is the risk of getting shut out of the bidding, of course|pg||
nt|royhughes: Nothing's perfect!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but ur comments on this deal seem near perfect :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I am a simple mind, bid 1nt when i can specially if i can find another way to tell my story|pg||
nt|royhughes: hard to quarrel with that|pg||
pc|d5|nt|szalay:  and dummy play is a hint as well|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bagman: The heart attempt is likely to fail as N has shown @DA and @CK already|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|szalay:  nice defence, anyway|pg||
pc|s3|nt|glen: it gains against boredom|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bagman: but there was nothing better to try|pg||
nt|athene: if so, that is another example of how much easier you make life for the defence when you tell them exactly what declarer has|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
nt|glen: now bonus trump trick possible|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the risk of under bidding is real, u can loose a vuln game also|pg||
nt|kingcur: claim for 8 coming|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|davpro: From declarer view E has got 2+@c, so @c to T is the only thing that might work|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bagman: NS currently the 7th; EW about that much from the bottom|pg||

nt|kirp:  so its 25-20 actually|pg||
nt|runnerup: feeling bid perhaps|pg||
nt|kirp:  25-22 sorry|pg||
nt|kirp:  this looks like easy 3N NS|pg||
nt|glen: and there you have it, never a dull moment|pg||
nt|glen: clever 1NT bid in the other room|pg||
nt|rv: Anklesaria has already shown @SA and can't have both @DA and @HK for passed hand|pg||
nt|rv: well played Zmud|pg||
nt|rv: Z-men are getting everything right here, expected from world class players|pg||
nt|royhughes: Different approaches -- that's what makes bridge so great|pg||
nt|benjy:  The hole only exists because north is too strong for a 1@S opener (when balanced)|pg||
nt|rv: possible auction 2n-3@s(puppet to 3n)-3n-4@c (@c club suit slam try)-4@d (cue)-4@h (cue)-6@c|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 6@h on a finesse|pg||
nt|rv: even this auction is slightly ambitious|pg||
nt|othered1: Forcing 2N on that hand is, in itself, a patch of a system hole :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: will W open 2nd seat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 5@H 2 down|pg||
nt|granguru:  Nunes went 1 off i  4@H here|pg||
nt|kirp:  NS may get to game in @Hs, not a succcess|pg||
nt|kirp:  2 opening bids, hard to sotp|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm mysterious|pg||
nt|pelu: @H AK |pg||
nt|MolvaM: ahh defence played @hAK|pg||
nt|szalay:  funny, that I read interviews about Fantunes-Angelini affair this morning|pg||
nt|jfaria:  now a choice between to major games|pg||
nt|glen: but W is not selling out cheaply here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south is forced into a view at this turn|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still the odds are west is about to raise spades, so bidding 3@H is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but above all good partnership is the more important|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jfaria:  sure not|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@H a transfer|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@D is unbalanced hand, so I guess N does not want to go 4 penalties|pg||
nt|glen: modern bridge: 3 value showing bids, and you have 14 high card points|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: its so easy when u see all 52 cards - try to take place behind the player and only see 26 cards|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: trouble here|pg||
nt|royhughes: West's 2@d shows a major|pg||
nt|royhughes: this is a common treatment today|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: not a good result for hungary in the other room|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok this if any must be 3nt all around ,but I have learned not to say it aloud,because something not so normal seems to happen somewhere in all boards |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Suicide opening|pg||
nt|toral5: where do you expect @C ace to be?|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: 4@S correct bid !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well that was a bit of a careless defence I thk|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the spade overcall|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well the alternative is also not attractive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@d says nothing about @h i presume, just shows fit/short|pg||
nt|glen: N's pass would be forcing for most, after the 4@D shortness bid|pg||
nt|glen: now S has to decide if his hand is gold, or straw|pg||
nt|glen: W cuebids and now that lets N show @H support|pg||
nt|glen: if W had bid 4@S, N would have a choice of bidding or passing|pg||
nt|kingcur: delayed action by W now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 5@s made on the unfortunate lead of the @c ace next door|pg||
nt|jbgood: doubled to boot|pg||
nt|rv: Zmud normally will pass with any semi-bal hand|pg||
nt|toral5: why would i talk after seeing 52 cards?|pg||
nt|toral5: you precisely play east for q10 @C.than @D duck is correct|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1Nt - 3Nt I hate to lead minor - often we have better attack in major|pg||
nt|jfaria:  since S cant X maybe N can|pg||
nt|rcerreto: avoided|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: transfer to spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H|pg||
nt|szalay:  I doubt anyone could miss a game here|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@S denies 4 @Ss|pg||
nt|rv: normal contract for E-W is 3n which has no play on @s lead ducked|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems to be 500 for charity|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 4@h is a good common sense bid|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: interesting bidding problem for E|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: north has not found hearts obfiously -so svedish increasing lead perhaps|pg||
nt|jfaria:  depending on agreement|pg||
nt|danilo1: Gold may see @C shortness ... and bid 5@S ... however, not easy choice ...|pg||
nt|kirp:  my explanations are all hypothetical here, have no idea what Poles are actually playing|pg||
nt|glen: wow, S lets 4@S by with a 6-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: E doesn't want to lead from her collection|pg||
nt|bagman: Every card might be right or wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: but lavazza may suffer in the end|pg||
nt|szalay:  and I wd like to be in 4S, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: most bid more than 1@S with four-card support but i am sure they will unravel it all|pg||
nt|roswolf: OH I COULD VERY EASILY:) |pg||
nt|szalay:  this game about vulnerable bonuses, more or less|pg||
nt|roswolf: might not be good play but.....|pg||
nt|danilo1: correct action - hand looks like double fits|pg||
nt|kirp:  I guess 2@Cs EW can be held to 4 trix|pg||
nt|jbgood: nunes might have won it - but forgot to pull trumps, and opps got a @d ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends how you interpret the double, does it invite a sac, i think so|pg||
nt|toral5: missed the lead here|pg||
nt|pelu: so my "normal" lead would be a @S from East - here killing :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  that's it|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well a simple 4@S on this one|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but congrats geoffrey for yr prediction powers|pg||
nt|jfaria:  that is a nice discussion about ownership of the hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  x from S would be TO so N cooperates|pg||
nt|benjy:  yes but there are loads of hands where one wants to respond, thats why i favour a gazilli style of rebids|pg||
nt|rv: this E-W seem to be playing accurate and steady bridge, are they new young stars of Italy|pg||
pc|h9|nt|szalay:  bridge wd be a very boring game if we could bid seen by both hands|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: cards laying very well for EW, should be no problem|pg||
pc|h3|nt|toral5: and that surely is WITHOUT seeing 52 cards:)|pg||
nt|pelu: my analyse is: 1: I dont like to lead minor, 2: @S or @H, 3: @HA entry,so: @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: u sensed that defence coming and predicted 5s making  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is cheeky|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wasnt a very scientific sequence|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but effective apparently|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like he will establish the 5th heart|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes methinks he is very lucky|pg||
nt|jbgood: that is the legitimate downer lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  problem is what to do with @D if you take 3 round of trumps|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|pelu: easy game here - time to go for coffee :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but go fast :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: here is the running scores and current ranking http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|kirp:  ruff a spade and 3 rounds of trumps and hope something good happens |pg||
nt|rcerreto: not quite young|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but emerging|pg||
pc|s5|nt|royhughes: NS made 3NT +1 in the other room|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|kirp:  oops|pg||
nt|glen: 2@Cs and a @D only, and this makes|pg||
nt|lechcold: ducking @D in  20 was not bad...it loses only if East has 1-2 small clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A (27 will qualify), and 74 teams playing in group B (only 5 teams will qualify)|pg||
nt|roswolf: you need to qualify for SWISS A then:)|pg||
nt|rv: if Texas had opened 3@s, Balicki might have bid 3n or doubled (close decision) and if he had doubled Zmud might have bid 4@c which is last making contract for E-W|pg||
pc|c2|nt|szalay:  I predict 3 imps for Angelini|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|danilo1: Bd 14 - peacefull 4@S in OR too ... so no swing|pg||
nt|glen: versace not cooperating|pg||
nt|glen: he will only win third @S play|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: goes for the crossruff|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6 back to the French with a double part score on  5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  Trump-lead, North then ducked the @D...|pg||
nt|lechcold: if U win the first trick, then U still have a @C guess ( 20)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kirp:  not sure why that @S play|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: i oncerad a statistic -if after a normal opening bid you bid game whenever you are vul you gain on average 8+ imps unless your opps double 66% of the time!: i doubted those stats ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: at the time but i am getting more convinced the more i play/watch the game|pg||
nt|roswolf: once read|pg||
nt|granguru:  for that you must end in summy and play @D to the Q ..if E takes you repeat the process|pg||
nt|jbgood: no need - Boye never got his @d ruff - I really wonder why|pg||
nt|kingcur: Willard running out into a making 2@S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|MolvaM: ohh|pg||
nt|szalay:  if u watch (and especially play) more, u know more:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  declarer may only take 9 trix here.|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems to have +1 in any case anyway |pg||
nt|kirp:  he does but does not know @Ds dont run|pg||
nt|kirp:  may not take @C finesse as not necessary!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|danilo1: danger is too loose trump control ... or to loose @C trick ... probably -1 as will try 3 @H in West|pg||
nt|kirp:  its easy here but ruffing the spade before last trump puts you in dummy for a @D lead|pg||
nt|pelu: agree Leck, the duck is with odds|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rv: what would panel bid on 3@s opening with East hand? X or 3n?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  3 NT - always|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|granguru:  12 imps for Mirage|pg||
nt|kirp:  a true mirage|pg||
nt|granguru:  now up 22-18|pg||
nt|kirp:  for E|pg||
nt|royhughes: I am very wary of making predictions -- but maybe just 4 trump tricks to EW for -1100?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jbgood: X-files was nothing compared to this - you really dont believe it - even if you see it:)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: lost his way|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.but we are allowed to guess correctly|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: this is not the best line- if you overcall on that garbage you need to play it well|pg||
nt|kirp:  ok making 4|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: on a club lead north could rise ace and play another :) now declarer might finesse as his only chance to make|pg||
nt|athene: thinking north might have @CAQx and be trying to scare him out of a winning play|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sunsamvar: nice def|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, it's good to cash all the winners to avoid trump endplay|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|nt|sunsamvar: useful swing to Vito to stretch lead to 13 imps|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't think declarer can do better than 4 down -- could do worse by playing A, 10|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or to 16 imps ... depending on how he plays @Hs|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer was sure about 7 tricks and had a shot for 9 (diamonds 3-3); he did not want to try anything in hearts because he might have lost 4 spade tricks|pg||
nt|athene: that would be the two down|pg||
nt|szalay:  re|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|athene: welcome back :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 7-1 @D was unlikely IMO|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: soft defense from Vriend-Arnolds against 2 S on board 5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|h7|nt|szalay:  hope u missed me (and my sarchastic view)|pg||

nt|lechcold: 2@S = 10+, 5+@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: a decent score for NS for 1NT up 2 on board 7 |pg||

nt|hawe45:  A fast - flat - board|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, agree with comments about downgrading|pg||
nt|rcerreto: to show a lead|pg||
nt|kingcur: but stiff @HK and @CA outside length are not appealing|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i bet 10 tricks here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D game force (xyz)|pg||
nt|rv: game missed here|pg||
nt|rcerreto: it makes a little difficult to partner to judge a sace, though|pg||
nt|rcerreto: just a matter of style|pg||
nt|benjy:  i would bid game as west personally|pg||
nt|benjy:  might even bid it as east as well|pg||
nt|othered1: me, too|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes, passing is a little conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would overcall for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: after 3@D i think north has an automatic 3nt|pg||
nt|runnerup: very speculiar bidding -really like this..|pg||
nt|glen: in the other room the 1@S opening found the major fit without problem|pg||
nt|toral5: any one for 6@D here?|pg||
nt|benjy:  when vul with nothing in @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay:  I think 1N is a tipical underbid by underdogs vs, world classes|pg||
nt|szalay:  at least 2N is sufficient|pg||
nt|athene: well, the problem is you know you don't want to play in 2nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has seen his pard's overcalls before|pg||
nt|jfaria: my Mac connection fade away, back in a micro pc|pg||
nt|rv: in my view Caiti should have surely raised here, additionally Pattacini could have bid it himself as well on auction|pg||
pc|d4|nt|danilo1: misfit hand ... so 3NT |pg||
nt|jfaria:  3nt, what eles?|pg||
nt|granguru:  SS should be -1|pg||
nt|pelu: Polish @C in action, nice to have Lech here to explain |pg||
nt|toral5: or 6h as the cards lie|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: The Dutch like dull boards at this stage of the match ...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: you want to play in 1nt or 3nt or a diamond partscore|pg||
nt|jfaria:  on the other hand 5@h had a chance|pg||
nt|danilo1: good conclusion by West that declarer has probably only 4-card @S (otherwise could bid 3@D) ... |pg||
pc|d2|nt|barbyh: could have heldthem to 1 less|pg||
nt|bagman: There is a theory, which states that against blind 3NT one should lead from the worse 4-carder from a 4432|pg||
nt|barbyh: against matchpoints or imps?|pg||
nt|bagman: both|pg||
nt|bagman: I don't subscribe to that theory but I was told that it was backed up by a huge simulation|pg||
nt|eamongall: The good news for McGann on the last board is some 3NT+2 company is appearing ...|pg||
nt|bagman: who knows; at least it makes leading easy|pg||
nt|barbyh: true, |pg||
nt|barbyh: well in this case lead from a club and you holdthemto 4|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond lead (suggested by the theory) holds the contract to 4, too|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after tomorrow evening the knockouts will start with 32 teams|pg||
nt|runnerup: can he escapepe for 1 down?|pg||
nt|kirp:  even on a good day i see 2 down|pg||
nt|kirp:  and given his bidding, i would gues 3 or more down|pg||
nt|granguru:  even -2|pg||
nt|kirp:  so a small pick up for EW, but not gteed|pg||
nt|rv: 2@h is @h +any other (incl @s), Polish weak 2|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes, I agree|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kirp:  we have seen down 3 morph  into down 1|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@S shortness I believe|pg||
pc|h2|nt|glen: this @S lead reduces communication to S hand to nothing|pg||
nt|lechcold: they will be in 6@H|pg||
nt|benjy:  this will be the second cold game of the set they have missed|pg||
nt|rcerreto: bidding 4 in E was also an option|pg||
nt|rv: Pattacini has working @DK and his hand improves after his partner's 1@s response|pg||
pc|hK|nt|granguru:  3 or 4 imps....|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jfaria:  played by N :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: some chance to increase spades |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 in red: u have to find 1 out of 2 key-cards (@HK - @DQ) fine odds for that|pg||
nt|toral5: they are on track|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|danilo1: ... unfortunately for him ...9 and 7 behind 1086|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Forrester may not see 9 tricks, but L/V have more dificulties in finding 5..|pg||
nt|danilo1: since @DK good, and @C10 coming will probably make ... sooner or later, opps must give him a trick|pg||
nt|kirp:  s thinks he can N a @S ruff, but makes no sense given the 5@C bid !|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: Israel in OR: stop in 4@h|pg||
nt|lechcold: Martens probably will make a move because of 55 distribution|pg||
nt|toral5: i think martens ll make 1 more bid with his reds shape|pg||
nt|toral5: nice scientific bidding by ew here.|pg||
nt|toral5: deserve to reach a slam:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D was 18+, so Jassem has no extras|pg||
nt|pelu: the red 10's are importen cards|pg||
nt|lechcold: on the other hand, x, AJxxx, Kxxx, Qxx gives reasonable slam|pg||
pc|h7|nt|szalay:  2D is an option as well, but u have stopper and kinda D suit, when u dont need length help|pg||
nt|granguru:  a red suit now|pg||
nt|rv: Anklesaria 3n is lebensohl response showing game values w/o 4@s and stopper in @h|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|granguru:  not easy|pg||
nt|kirp:  W cant lead a @S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|davpro: the @d losers vanished|pg||
nt|jbgood: not easy to find the @d lead|pg||
nt|davpro: nope|pg||
nt|toral5: now a question of an extra trick depending upon locating @D q|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Macs and ipads are not compatible with BBO :(|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c2|nt|athene: south just has a harder problem over 1@S than if east passed|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I mean Gold thx|pg||
nt|kirp:  a @h now and its 3 or more down|pg||
nt|kirp:  good switch|pg||
nt|granguru:  excelent defense by brogeland|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kingcur: 7 to Holland on  6, with the French in 2@s off 3|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: the other semi-final also is really close: 7 imps difference, team Joel behind|pg||
nt|kingcur: Vriend's weak two @D making things a little harder for NS|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: 7 useful imps for the on board 6 after 2 Cl opener (showing weak two in D, among others|pg||
pc|sT|nt|glen: will W exit with a @C?|pg||
nt|jbgood: he has to be on his toes:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: maybe Jassem has extras, though:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|glen: (no)|pg||
nt|granguru:  angelini's turn to open @H|pg||
nt|granguru:   second exelent move|pg||
nt|jbgood: but the 8?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: another poor contract but more reasonable to bid|pg||
nt|athene: that's one reason for overcalling|pg||
nt|szalay:  if he has sthg extras, lets play 3N. 2D and 3D isnt bad, but very likely he will decline without AofD|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|danilo1: exiting with @C would not help ... since declarer may play @HA and @HQ .. therefore Alfredo (hoping in @HK at pd) tried to search 2 @S tricks |pg||
nt|kingcur: Carla Arnolds very wisely assuming 2@S couldn't possibly be NS's best place to land|pg||
mc|10|nt|danilo1: not taking 10 looks like error |pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: west treated her hand as just a game force, nothing more (could have bid 3@H)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|jeanhari: good lead|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|chick: this should be very makeable even with both red finesses failing, losing 2 red kings and the @CA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|ritong: perhaps declarer's preoccupation should be checking @ds first|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: if @d K is on, it would impact trump handling|pg||
nt|chick: I was thinking the same, and then lead toward the @HQ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jeanhari: was a better line, but she will play clubs from hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: and a @s back, trying to tap declarer|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jeanhari: agonising as defender ifyou know declarercant go wrong|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can play a diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: @d Q looks ok|pg||
nt|ritong: either they play a @s and dummy is high, or they dont and declarer's hand is high|pg||
nt|ritong: when trumps were 4/1, though, it might be vital not to lose a @d|pg||
nt|jeanhari: only danger is a spade overruff if notrh has the K of diamonds|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so play is not clear from this point|pg||
nt|ritong: in any case, as it is almost always the case, first establish the side suit and afterwards go after trumps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jeanhari: indeed.. club to dummy and diamond to the queen also poss|pg||
nt|ritong: arnolds decides that trumps are 3/2|pg||

nt|hawe45:  West must play this 3 NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: more distributional hands|pg||
nt|athene: well 2@D-3@D does show a decent hand so if he has some extra hcp he will bid it anyway|pg||
nt|szalay:  suddent death is coming|pg||
nt|glen: lack of entries has declarer not taking a trump finesse,but instead go for the 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump finesse was dangerous actually, might score queen and diamond overruff then|pg||
nt|juror2: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or32runda1.html|pg||
nt|rv: those 2 are arguably 2 of top 5 partnerships in the world|pg||
nt|toral5: heading for a cliffhanger.2 imps deficit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Back with the Mac u mean :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  y :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 3nt in wrong hand so chance for Zaleski|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South led a small @C, but East had to go wrong|pg||
nt|kirp:  lots of potential here, but actually a part score|pg||
nt|kirp:  this match has seen too many weak NTs|pg||
nt|glen: specs note on last board that taking @S finesse could result in not making the contract|pg||
nt|rv: bridge Gods favor Texan Aces in this event, they got through as 5th team in repechage 4 yrs back and went on to reach finals,  2 yrs back they won appeal and then tie-break against ...|pg||
nt|rv: strong Polish team in R32 and went on to reach semis|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
nt|MolvaM: we just love deals with a void rite? :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm 3nt is unlucky to fail here|pg||
nt|szalay:  but it rather looks hungarian death:(|pg||
nt|jbgood: it is not only the NTs that have been weak:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: on the other hand, with bad 18 (if 18 can be bad) Jassem would have bid 4@H after 3@D|pg||
nt|toral5: a jordan 2nt or a fit showing 3d?or just 4h?|pg||
nt|lechcold: delicate decision both hands|pg||
nt|april7: truscott 2NT|pg||
nt|toral5: 4s is a gud save here|pg||
nt|kingcur: another 4@H to EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1@D 3@D easy ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt opening not everyones choice|pg||
nt|royhughes: Lavazza made 4Hx+1 in the other room|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I was trying to help Supermax when I went down :(|pg||
nt|benjy:  WOuld you guys overcall 1@H?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|glen: modern bidding: three value showing bids to you, and you have 10 high card points|pg||
nt|runnerup: north didnt want open 4 @h because he was too good,but he has his 7 tricks and that is it |pg||
nt|kirp:  N has too many @Ds, knows S also has them or a bad hand|pg||
nt|glen: as martin just said|pg||
nt|rv: Zimmerman was argubaly the weak link in the team and Texans haven't been able to capitalize on this|pg||
nt|rcerreto: unsure, I think I wouldn't|pg||
nt|othered1: no|pg||
nt|rcerreto: no strong feelings though|pg||
nt|rv: this year, they were 40 down after 6 brds in R32 against Zimmerman, outscored 2 world class pairs 38-2 in last 14 brds to win by 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 2nt is?|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  how many @h will L/V play?|pg||
nt|glen: established partnerships often use transfers over the negative double|pg||
nt|runnerup: they had 800 ta take other table but wanted to 200 away|pg||
nt|kirp:  Note that 3N by E is cold|pg||
nt|granguru:  rofl|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jbgood: quad est demonstrandum|pg||
nt|toral5: here they go|pg||
nt|panja: not me....and in comparison to 2@D on the previous deal....this is definitely more avoidable|pg||
nt|kingcur: and with the two key red Kings offside not wise to go look for slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|runnerup: winnig some ipms strange way|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To miss this 5 @D - played by West - will bring Zaleski  8 IMP|pg||
nt|jbgood: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/orrrunda7.html enables you to follow the exciting fights for 3rd place in some of the groups|pg||
nt|glen: the angelini team is show as in  29 spot on the running scores|pg||
nt|glen: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda7.html|pg||
nt|rv: 3@h here shows 4@s, no @h stopper and GF values|pg||
nt|kingcur: impartially speaking then, of course :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks boring with no heart barrage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade fit and?|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@H could cost 500|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@h could just escape for down 3 I guess|pg||
nt|kirp:  and by W goes down 3|pg||
nt|jbgood: (pls forgive my bad Latin)|pg||
nt|granguru:  too high already|pg||
nt|kirp:  quid errrat demonstratum|pg||
nt|kirp:  !!!|pg||
nt|rv: part of lebensohl structure|pg||
nt|toral5: 5h also makes.trump q should be located i guess.|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: The only danger is ending at the 5-level with all finesses wrong|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|hvdhaar: probably non-serous (or frivolous) 3 NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: serious 3N by E probably: a bid indicating that E has a good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: W has so much extras that he can afford to bid the game in NT instead of looking for the spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 teams go to the A Swiss - and the others to B|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: even from a kib: hunc est dimostrandum:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|davpro: 9 tricks in NT here|pg||
nt|granguru:  QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM|pg||
nt|glen:  29 spot puts the team in tomorrow's pairs event|pg||
nt|glen: now  28, so close|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 27 from A and 5 from B continue in knockout stage|pg||
nt|pelu: so far 5 tables out of 16 in 6@h (B22)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but it pushed opps one level higher|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: the 5th D is the only wxtra asset|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay:  what wd u say as west? i feel it normal 1n|pg||
nt|kirp:  lovely fit here, good system when pard has to play the hand|pg||
mb|4D|nt|szalay:  good lead:)|pg||
nt|athene: this match does illustrate the "game every hand" philosophy - most deals at least one pair is in game, and when one side bid game and the other didn't, the aggressive action ...|pg||
nt|athene: usually gained|pg||
nt|roswolf: @CQ followed by a diamond switch is possible|pg||
nt|glen: the knockout is hard tomorrow, 24 teams exit, 8 remain|pg||
nt|toral5: this is 1 down|pg||
nt|kingcur: but then again I tend to overrate 5-5's|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@D great choice by Versace|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S seemed to be too optimistic with no fit for pard's suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: ot @CJ:)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  $1h is a real chalenge :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: tu kibs - you are truly a learned audience:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad play - @C-swithcg will be killing|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: 31 imps so far for people in game when other room played partscore|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw support X instead of 2C is queationable with so nice C suit|pg||
nt|athene: many play support double is obligatory|pg||
nt|roswolf: I CERTAINLY DO|pg||
nt|athene: even with xxx and AKQJ10xx :)|pg||
nt|szalay:  we opened cause we have so nice C suit|pg||
nt|szalay:  I said only: questionable, may be I wd XX myself|pg||
nt|athene: nunes knows if he wins this he doesn't have much chance|pg||
nt|jfaria:  4@h I mean|pg||
nt|danilo1: why 2NT alerted ... it just shows what he has :) ... 3-card @C support, some Hcp, BAL hand - and @S stop|pg||
nt|jfaria:  no x lavazza will score|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: perhaps even he didnt expect mojor Q eens to table |pg||
nt|roswolf: really|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt not makeable i think so -entryes dead|pg||
nt|kirp:  score is 36-22 for NS, this a good pickup for EW and match is not over|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but ducking could lead to even more down of course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Undo, pls|pg||
nt|rv: surprising Balicki didn't find the switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|hvdhaar: you're probably right Cor or else west wouldn't try over 3 NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: nice stop here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|toral5: ericas will lose here after seeing the other room result|pg||
nt|toral5: so israel increases thr lead|pg||
nt|toral5: no @D king now and 4s x is home|pg||
nt|toral5: @C q10 coming|pg||
nt|pelu: strange that decl - after the X- didnt find @Hq - he even strat the @H-play with @HK|pg||
nt|toral5: contract depends on the card south plays|pg||
nt|lechcold: yes, it was little strange|pg||
nt|toral5: tough time for ginossar|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 7 imps back to the Coffee guys|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|roswolf: really!?|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw its the correct line if @Cs are 5-3|pg||
nt|athene: he has 8 tricks so he wants north to cash out his clubs - hoping he just loses four tricks and then has a spade-diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade finesse is more or less marked|pg||
nt|rv: with no entry in his hand, suspected he will not continue @hs and then it is matter of which suit to switch|pg||
nt|rv: rare error by Balicki, you might not see another one till the end of this match:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jbgood: i guess they play 2@c as game force - but not sure. if so, E may have regretted his pass, 3 nt always on|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4s showed fit+limit hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks -1|pg||
nt|glen: if you just alert only natural, you cut down on the number of alerts|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Lauria must decide between @d and @s |pg||
nt|glen: @d ace now, and with nothing better to do, then the @C J?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Versace I mean |pg||
nt|jbgood: (and I will never try Latin again, apart from Volvo and Vademecum:))|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|toral5: why will north push a @C looking at king on table WITHOUT @D ace?wel done eldad|pg||
pc|s2|nt|szalay:  and try for D-S squeeze|pg||
nt|fabsayc: certainly %|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe -2|pg||
nt|roswolf: obviously west thought 1@C was short ish|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: In the Netherlands 3 H normally is played is INV|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bagman: Even with the bad club break, declarer has 11 tricks losing only the two aces and scoring well in the pairs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kirp:  sorry 36-23|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bagman: sry, the spades break also badly.... |pg||
nt|kingcur: Laura Dekkers can see 3 likely tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps E just took a shot with his meager values|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: atleast 1 down here, possibly even 2 down unless he gets @ds right|pg||
nt|panja: the dbl of 1@H...creates an erroneous impression...|pg||
nt|panja: so with two small @H..South is tempted to compete|pg||
nt|rv: North might have felt his @HKQ were working cards though he has bulk of values in opps suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: so declarer has only the same 10 tricks as those who play in spades|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kirp:  down 2 lookslke|pg||
nt|jbgood: 27 teams from A and 5 from B go to the KO stage - no c/o|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: I can't fault his double too much|pg||
nt|rcerreto: is passing 1@h a real option?|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Panja is suggesting 1n instead of double|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ah, ok|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I missed that, sorry|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rv: what is panel's view double or North with North hand?|pg||
nt|rv: double or 1n?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|danilo1: if @DA cashed (far away from obvious), than depends how serious Versace will take 2NT bid by South|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|glen: in another match, the @D was ducked as well|pg||
nt|panja: dbl could be an option......or 1Nt...but the point is....South will compete a level higher after the dbl with heavy @H values|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: dummy is really le mort now|pg||
nt|rcerreto: if you X then you can show a @h stopper|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||

nt|jfaria:  in the meantime, while i was wondering in ether i heard some harsh coments of brother lucius about not bidding 1ntt on board 6 :)|pg||
nt|rv: wd to limit damage by Keyzad Anklesaria|pg||
nt|panja: with @SQ to 4 and @cqxx, surely 1Nt is worth considering..with @SAxxx....and three small Clubs....well|pg||
nt|rv: saving a trick on deal like last could make all the difference between staying alive in tourney or going home:)|pg||

nt|kingcur: Holland down in 1NT where the French made 10 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|kingcur: here, West did open 1@C in 2nd seat, and it landed them in an inferior contract|pg||
nt|kingcur: Quite a few costly swings in part score boards, so far|pg||

mb|2H|nt|kirp:  looks like NS in OR have a huge result, so Angelini may yet win this match,as it 36-30 right now|pg||
nt|rv: every OT and UT could be crucial in this match and I suspect both teams realise that|pg||
mb|2S|nt|MolvaM: now 28 :)|pg||
nt|glen: hey, toronto is moving close to vancouver|pg||
nt|royhughes: We are paid to express opinions!|pg||
nt|royhughes: (exactly what they are worth)|pg||
nt|kingcur: now W may downgrade her hand, looking at @HQxx|pg||
nt|kingcur: and bad trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: EW can make here 10 tricks in NT on a club lead 11 tricks otherwise|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 more matches will be played tomorrow and then 27 teams from group A, and 5 teams from group B will proceed to the knockouts|pg||
nt|athene: Fantunes are sort of forced to play weak notrump as a consequence of the rest of their system|pg||
nt|kirp:  both these teams look to qualify i think|pg||
nt|glen: or is it still 4am eastern?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he sure expressed himself :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and brother lucius's partners are paid to listen :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay:  if u know your pd is so weak for weak NT u wd pass|pg||
nt|szalay:  some players have this "magic talent", others not|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they reach 4@S now north will have all the info he needs to axe|pg||
nt|kirp:  this does look like 10 trix|pg||
nt|rv: arguably Monaco Z, Lavazza, Mahaffey and Angelini were the pre-tourney favorites, Angelini are already out since they finished 30th in Swiss A|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davpro: What have I missed in the bidding?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tomorrow we start at 10.00 hrs CET|pg||
nt|roswolf: these 2 teams will surely be in contention|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4am eastern yes :)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@H is not much of a preemptive raise with 5 trumps|pg||
nt|rv: they are still many excellent Polish teams, Israel, Netherlands who could easily beat any of the favorites|pg||
nt|rv: both East and West have stretched here|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW did well here -- picked off NS's best suit and then stopped in a good 2@c|pg||
nt|rv: very heavy 2@d by Caiti, possibly it is inverted minor and passed by East|pg||
nt|kingcur: and thus avoiding the non making game, well done|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Vriend probably should have retreated to 2 Cl; partner seems to have has at least 2 Clubs (not 4 H or S nor 6 D)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|szalay:  this partnership has this "talent"|pg||
nt|roswolf: east has heard the warning bell|pg||
nt|athene: east simply discounted his @CQ on the bidding, so he is left with a nine-count|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that was fine judgment|pg||
nt|szalay:  as I watched many times: they r frequently agressive when pd has good hand, and passive when has bad one...we call it: "magican"|pg||
nt|rcerreto: if 1@D is precision style, 2@D should be positive|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect they play inverted minor on even after Interference, Pattacini passed it since he has sub-min and Caiti is passed hand |pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally Dutch are defending champions in this event|pg||
nt|rcerreto: suit quality was not that good, though|pg||
nt|panja: Decl can discard a Major suit loser on other Major here|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: great pass by Bessis downgrading her H Q|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: only 8 trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good lead|pg||
nt|glen: now N has room to jump support @Ss|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bagman: E bid 3NT to show the spade stopper in case W was interested in that; If W had a huge @H raise, he would not pass 3NT|pg||
nt|davpro: W probably showed a M?|pg||
nt|davpro: 2@d balanced hand , 3@c a major, 4@d ask major  (according to a kib)|pg||
nt|jbgood: probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little optimistic but a fair shot|pg||
nt|glen: 3@S asks are you italian, 4@S=yes|pg||
nt|kirp:  4th best lead, nothing better to sooth the soul|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ace - and !Queen = ruff|pg||
nt|rv: East could have passed instead of 1@S opening and Zmud could have raised to 2@s with flat 4333 shape|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 3 means, that the @D King is in North|pg||
pc|h9|nt|glen: this allows non-italians to play the partscore|pg||
nt|granguru:  with this trick Angelini made his contract|pg||
nt|glen: this should coast home nicely, with no nasty splits about|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: @S-lead would have given the 9. trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: normal lead actually but sometimes people dont like to lead from 5 small minors and choose a major|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hvdhaar: this will cost for the Dutch is my prediction|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: the curse of underleading aces|pg||
nt|davpro: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still down|pg||
nt|glen: unfriendly @Ds here|pg||
nt|granguru:  if N plays @S Anelini wins the match|pg||
nt|granguru:  If n plays @C is it a tie|pg||
nt|granguru:  @h3 suit pref signal for @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: he has 2 black suits - a 50 % ? either this or that...:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this will close the gap|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kirp:  know pard has cards in @Hs, cant have enuff in @Ss to run the suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kingcur: if N bids in other room, Vriend should take the same view|pg||
nt|kingcur: and she's not known to be an oberly optimistic bidder :)|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Arnolds will jump to 3 S :)|pg||
nt|kingcur: overly*|pg||
nt|kingcur: true, that may happen|pg||
nt|kingcur: 8 to France again, finding the save in 4@S and not being doubled in it at that|pg||
nt|kingcur: on board  8|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: the safe at nr. 8 was really cheap, no DBL over 4 Spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: but the good old rule 4. best in yout longest suit :) - and here East has indicatet 4 card @s|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right peter :)|pg||
nt|glen: will doom this|pg||
nt|pelu: can u find a way to 9 tricks?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me board 17 was doubled in other room|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well done for 200|pg||
nt|khaled_m: Spade on a Heart|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to run the diamonds hoping for too many heart discards|pg||
nt|toral5: @S q10 nicely placed|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right - and @HA|pg||
nt|lechcold: if spade is played from the table, East must put @S10|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.dummy is an entry short thn|pg||
pc|d5|nt|MolvaM: if thats the case 5 imps more could go to monaco-Z |pg||
nt|roswolf: restart in 15-20mins|pg||
nt|kingcur: Willard taking the occasion to show her two-suiter there|pg||
pc|dK|nt|runnerup: killing lead |pg||
nt|MolvaM: well we shall see|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the juniors have been brushed aside|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes so close match 36-39 probably -alot off interesting boards tx all bye|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|danilo1: obvious @S |pg||
pc|s5|nt|davpro: Does S know who has got the @d 4?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Angelini wins by 2 imps I think|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|MolvaM: spade switch was needed|pg||
nt|glen: with 9 of 10 boards reported in this match, its Kanin in  18, Consus in  38|pg||
nt|glen: hungry steve (ok, hungary steve) is in 27, opp mirage in  28|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start in 22mins approx from now|pg||
nt|pelu: no X when I see the bidding in OR (direct on the tabler)|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the ace and diamond up looks plausible|pg||
nt|kirp:  thx all, |pg||
nt|royhughes: looks like 5 imps to lavazza|pg||
nt|khaled_m: spade gets ruffed|pg||
nt|panja: best to win @DA next...and do the needful|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: for results http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda3.html|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: the idea is you just want to make sure of two heart tricks and if the finesses loses you might not even get two|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw first 27 from swiss A, first 5 from swiss B go to KO|pg||
nt|athene: but losing finesse doesn't matter here anyway with the nice breaks in the red suits|pg||
nt|szalay:  and first 8 has the right to choose opps from 9-32|pg||
nt|jbgood: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html for late arrived kibs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: tu all - also for your Latin lessons! bye|pg||
nt|granguru:  bye and ORA PRO NOBIS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now diamond ace and diamond|pg||
nt|kingcur: beit that Arnolds bid 1N in stead of 2@C, which reduces the risk considerably|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bagman: There's no legitimate squeeze but it costs nothing to try|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now the defensive spade trick vanishes|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes which was why it was a fair shot|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: in OR, Sridhar jumped to 4@h on 1@h-1@s on brd 22, no 2@d O/C by North in that room|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|davpro: I need some sleep. Thx all kibs for pointing out my stupidity|pg||
nt|dburn: I doubt he cares all that much about the four, given what happened to the ace|pg||
nt|szalay:  the ranking order 9-32 is decided by NOT the result, but WBF/EBL masterpoints|pg||
nt|jfaria:  kind of 2 out of 3 ok, not a bad game vuln|pg||
nt|pelu: Russia has made a great comeback against Denmark - down 51-19 at halftime, but after 24 boards up 65-61 :(:(:(:(|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Bad communication, but 3 NT seems OK|pg||
nt|royhughes: lots of flags|pg||
nt|rv: spec was pointing, Italian bridge is so top heavy that any young or new pair have to play extraordinarily well to displace any of the top starts in national team|pg||
nt|rv: stars|pg||
nt|benjy:  True it must be tough|pg||
nt|rcerreto: that's a real problem|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Joel now 23 behind in the other semi-final|pg||
nt|kingcur: so, the match is really close now, and probably not what the Dutch had wished for|pg||
nt|kingcur: big hand for West here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: will they get to slam|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: right, Indian Bridge is similar...can a young pair easily win any big event Venky?|pg||
nt|rcerreto: good pairs are not encouraged to work |pg||
nt|rv: they have Lauria, Versace, Bocchi, Sementa, Duboin, Madala, Fantoni, Nunes|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Here is an interesting bidding challenge|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kingcur: likely to end in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 6@c looks like a good spot to me|pg||
nt|rcerreto: to improve their level|pg||
nt|rcerreto: even winning a national championship is close to impossible|pg||
nt|panja: and India has Tewari, Kushari and his protege, Kista-JM, Shridhar...it is almost similar..isn't it?|pg||
nt|rv: in my view Indian bridge is not so top heavy Panja|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bagman: N might be showing @H + m at least 55|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good slam... only requires @H break|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|royhughes: 6@h is ok too but maybe a bit more problematic if the hearts are 4-1|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: I expected a 2 Cl opener by West showing some semi-gameforcing hand|pg||
nt|kingcur: surprised that W decided to open 1@S only...she's very lucky to see her pd bid 1NT on a 4 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: incidentally all matches from R32 till semi-finals are 14x2, 2 k/o rounds today and tomorrow, finals on Wed is 14x3|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hvdhaar: W checking if E has 5 H's|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: do you mean to say Itali has a big gap after those 10 players? I doubt that...|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: well bid auction|pg||
nt|pelu: NL-red 49-1 but now only 63-42 against Lovicz|pg||
nt|jfaria:  W got 2 aces but poor @h|pg||
nt|rv: yes Formidables, DSM and Texan Aces are cut above rest, we don't such a big difference in comparision to other top 8 or 10 teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: waited for his second suit then bid spades|pg||
nt|panja: what you perhaps mean is that the (average of) top Italian players are a touch superiour than the avg. of top Indian players..and that is certainly true|pg||
nt|kingcur: basically, all you need is @HK and one or two spades...so much too strong to open 1@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bagman: W had enough to balance but not enough to invite further|pg||
nt|rv: 2n is forcing here, I presume they would invite with 1n-2@c-2x-2@s|pg||
pc|d3|nt|khaled_m: communication problem|pg||
pc|d2|nt|royhughes: true.  heart 9 and club jack are useful plus values|pg||
nt|jfaria:  he shows the aces and let p take control|pg||
nt|royhughes: both quite valuable opposite partner's hand|pg||
nt|benjy:  There aren't many countries where the top 10 players are all multiple european and world championship winners|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bagman: Are NS leading 3rd/low or is this an alarm clock lead?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  9th trick - might have problems is West ducks twice with the @D Ace|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Venkatesh's sequence here shows 5@s+4@d, mild slam try, he was stretching here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but E doesnt want to take control either|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hands fit well but tough to find out the @Cj, @H9 for East and the solid @C suit for West|pg||
nt|royhughes: Sementa-Duboin made it tough in the other room with a spade barrage|pg||
nt|jfaria:  either side must take a share of optimism|pg||
nt|jfaria:  easy if E bid 4@c instead of 2@s|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a slight overbid though|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think West can go on -- his partner has tried for slam opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but 4@C tends to show not so good a hand |pg||
nt|jfaria:  slam try with very good @c , no?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes but the east hand is too good in my book for 4@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: Was the 4@h bid after noticeable thought?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I was busy typing, as usual|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dont think there was a pause|pg||
nt|royhughes: That's good -- you want to be in tempo when you sign off in game|pg||

nt|bagman: Most poles play 2/4 leads, as far as I know|pg||

pc|d5|nt|hvdhaar: I am informed that 3 H was TRF  to spades; 2 N art. GF|pg||

pc|d4|nt|pelu: 111 tricks even with @Ss 5-0 - no ruffs in East|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bagman: An alarm clock lead is an unexpected card telling partner to do something unexpected|pg||
nt|barbyh: lol in order to wake partner up?|pg||
nt|bagman: often a wrong honor or wrong card from known length|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hvdhaar: the West-hand has almost 9 playing tricks so 1 Sp is quite remarkable having a strong 2 Cl-opener in ones repertoire|pg||

nt|rcerreto: they usually group in 2 teams|pg||
nt|rcerreto: and what you're left with is 3rd place|pg||

nt|rcerreto: 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  even 6nt is a make, i think, but @d better|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benjy:  but if you X and pd bids 2@H do you sit it or correct to 2NT?|pg||
nt|kingcur: which may lead to a not so good game|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: anyone for bidding 2@C with the East hand insted of 1@S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hvdhaar: doens't feel good regarding position|pg||
nt|kingcur: 2N then|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: double and correct to 2n|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: tough lead for N|pg||
nt|rcerreto: the problem with dbl is that, after 2@h, you feel forced to bid 2NT|pg||
nt|rcerreto: and then pd could think you've 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: I wouldn't upgrade N hand, would you?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: Balicki's 4@c shows auto splinter with good 6+@s|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like Israel are pulling away|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3N works...it's probably end of Ericas hopes:(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H would too; both depending on a favourable heart position|pg||
nt|benjy:  well you could raise 2@D to 3@D if he bid it|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: I like to upgrade 14 with some tens and some tenaces|pg||
nt|kingcur: and when opps lead the suit you found reason to upgrade in, things don't look good, usually :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|barbyh: 4 h, or 4 sp all roads lead to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense needs to cash the @CA after the diamond lead|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|barbyh: or 12 if the dont cash|pg||
nt|kingcur: things will start looking brighter now, giving N opportunity now to develop @S tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|benjy:  no you would bid 2@S with that|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: If the Frenck treat 1 S - 1 NT as forcing the will end up in 2 S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: Declarer might win this in dummy and lead a diamond|pg||
nt|rcerreto: unclear|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: lucky for West.. wd have been a guess on th @H lead|pg||
nt|kingcur: not sure if they play F 1NT|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: Texans need a big swing in the next couple of boards to reduce the deficit and believe they have a chance, also carry a bit of momentum into second segment|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|jfaria:  was just saying that a kib sugested 6@d would be in danger after a @c lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: needs a good guess in D to make (looks like)|pg||
nt|kingcur: with this lay out no danger in @C suit, as EW can never get the suit running|pg||
pc|h3|nt|barbyh: pretty hardto lead a clubnow|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but to be honest i wd lead a @C too... not give anything away|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 10-11HCP with 4 weak spades, for instance...|pg||
nt|rcerreto: this sequences are like skating on thin ice|pg||
nt|benjy:  Every partnership should have these sequences sorted out|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bagman: Declarer now has the entries to ruff the diamond and to take the rest|pg||
nt|benjy:  they are relatively common after all|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: 1 down now, these boards and contracts will suit Texans fine now that they have lead|pg||
nt|vugraphplc: small break|pg||
nt|rv: this table is playing quite fast|pg||
nt|benjy:  The more i think about it the more i dislike 2nt with such a poor stopper, sure its right on values, but partner passes with a 4441 minimum and you are in a terrible spot|pg||
nt|panja: true..if the dbl can be light....East should consider a pass, too.....there might be a % to that....with a 4333 aceless hand|pg||
nt|rv: double and then 2n gets other suits in and not so bullish about strain, partner could correct to 3@d or even rebid weak 5M|pg||
nt|khaled_m: will return after about 1 hour|pg||
nt|benjy:  How on earth can you pass Panja?|pg||
nt|panja: well, it is a % issue...|pg||

nt|rcerreto: chances for a swing here?|pg||
nt|benjy:  e/w can make a fair frew tricks in @Ds|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but will maybe play in @s|pg||
nt|rv: N-S can make more in @hs?|pg||
nt|panja: 20-20 HCP...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: NS could have successfully competed to 3@H but they took the kiss of dementor, 200, instead|pg||
nt|jfaria:  good result in closed for Vito|pg||
nt|jfaria:  open , mean|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt also making|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: butler scores of all pairs as well as score-sheets of all matches can be viewed at http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|panja: 3@C good for NS|pg||
nt|benjy:  i'm not sure thats true about more in @H on a trump lead?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kingcur: ok, various other appraoches might have worked better, but still...|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Closed they are still playing brd 10 !|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@H here, but not 5@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|barbyh: why whats worse than that?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@h is transfer to @s, Venkatesh's 2@h is risky proposition|pg||
nt|rv: yes @c strain plays better for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this is 500 territory if Balicki passes|pg||
nt|jfaria:  dont think N will pass|pg||
nt|jfaria:  after receiving a fit in the 6th suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: did S have a free bid and once he has North will bid 4 @S|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pelu: ok last board  gratilation to Israel - and tx to our great operator, my fellow commentators and to many very active kibs -|pg||
nt|benjy:  thoughts on the 2@S rebid?|pg||
nt|rv: this is 1 down on normal @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hvdhaar: wow, Marion found a raise !|pg||
nt|kingcur: Michielsen going for the game, assuming her points behind the dbl will be worth something|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|benjy:  2@D is normal for me|pg||
nt|rv: my preference is to treat @s suit as 5 bagger and much prefer 2@d|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I?d rather rebid a 6 card major than a 4 card minor|pg||
nt|panja: this could go 2 down, could it not?|pg||
nt|panja: no...@HK will offer a @D discard|pg||
nt|benjy:  after 2@C if partner hasn't bid 2@H with 5 then he rates to hold 4@D quite often i think|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: QJ in Sp lookes bad ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: I said 'something' , not 'a lot' :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|bagman: S hand is typical where one bids 3NT and waits for the dummy to appear|pg||
nt|barbyh: northcould have save the day by bidding 4 sp|pg||
nt|barbyh: thats if he felt lucky|pg||
nt|eamongall: At another table McGann Brown left opps in 5@Ds ...not best matchpoint effort by NS board 14 |pg||
nt|barbyh: odds are pd has a good minor|pg||
nt|bagman: Some NS have reached 4@H making; S has probably doubled and N felt that nobody plays minors in pairs|pg||
nt|bagman: and why play 6@D when 6N is an as easy make |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rv: with 3 trumps, Balicki didn't want to take any chance especially in the context of good set they have had at this table|pg||
nt|kingcur: Spec points out 3@H may well be forcing to game, NS having other ways to invite|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: I love Michielsen's decision but it is a trifle lucky that the NS fit that well|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: highly unlikely i.m.o.|pg||
nt|kingcur: 5 to France, who have now taken the lead|pg||
nt|kingcur: Dutch EW one off in 3@S|pg||
nt|kingcur: board 10|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: the bidding looks wrong Arnolds passing an 12 count with 6-4-shape !|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lechcold: tx all, bye|pg||
nt|jfaria:  8 tricks to get a plus |pg||
nt|rcerreto: it could but it shouldn't|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hvdhaar: if so then Carla is shaky after the revoke (of which I'am not certain)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sunsamvar: a kib says "Spasov is 22 years old boy and is one of the best junior players in Bulgaria :) "|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: last bd here.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jfaria:  first guess wrong|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: shd have @D till later i feel|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and pld trump from hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  wanted a quick entry to play @s from dummy...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx Joao... been a pleasure commentating wityh you.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|rv: if quality of @s suit was better, I would bid 2@s instead of 2@d, here I will go with 2@d|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

mb|3D|mb|4C|nt|fokal: or 1370 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i d guess 650 NS, rather|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, even when  16 was a very good result for Holland|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ritong: but the ground becomes slippy...|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but can vary from +1370 for NS or -1 in 6@C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fokal: indeed |pg||
nt|fokal: resticted choice issues|pg||
nt|ritong: yep|pg||
nt|jeanhari: where -100 is more logical|pg||
nt|kingcur: other room bid 2@S-4@S and then E came in with 5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|vugraphplf: Might end up in a 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: still|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jeanhari: south cueing diamonds as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: South answered in @c, quite logically|pg||
nt|ritong: south answers BW with @cs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 900 is 14 imps?|pg||
nt|kingcur: The French going down in slam will mean a tie in the match with one board to go|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|fokal: and a good board for the dutch|pg||
nt|kingcur: but there's a chance of EW taking a save in 6@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: je opvoeren :)|pg||
nt|fokal: @s lead !|pg||
nt|ritong: i m not optimistic|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fokal: to explain the singleton|pg||
nt|chick: 5@S could be construed as a signoff attempt, and bypassing 6@C to bid 6@S is impossible, so they aren't ever going to play in spades|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: bene will peacefully go down|pg||
nt|jeanhari: lead wont matter much but spade lead might give away a clue.. not that smart having a trick yourself|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so good lead by Arnolds, now wait and see|pg||

nt|kingcur: less tight now|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: In the open the Texas Aces took the lead vs. Mahaffey |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kingcur: Vriend also opening 1@S on  11, and being left there|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|bagman: A part score battle hand: NS can make 2@H and EW can make 3m|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: 5-10 hcp with 5 Sp and a minor|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6 more to France, very unnecissarily, I'd say|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: that hand is a claer forcing opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|barbyh: not with a tr lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: substitute 3m with 3@D|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bagman: If EW take both of their ruffs, there's still club to come|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d3|nt|kingcur: NS could have set this a lot: 1@S, 3@H, 2@C for 800|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|vugraphplf: Let's see if they can win 5@D...|pg||
nt|chick: what happens in the case of a tie?  do they play more boards?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: slam wasnt good... needed moere then trumps alone|pg||
nt|fokal: that's a good question... I hope|pg||
nt|kingcur: in other room, Marion Michielsen opened 1@D in N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jeanhari: 5@D well done by dutch girls|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: (the real girls)|pg||

nt|hvdhaar: very well played by Michielsen; perhaps East considered a DBL over 5 D ...|pg||
nt|kingcur: only chance for France after not opening 1@D would have been to bid 5@D as a save and getting doubled there...|pg||
nt|fokal: S again was really shy|pg||

nt|kingcur: but the Dutch do need a swing now if they want to stand a chance to make the final|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|kingcur: a very light 1@D by N here|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hvdhaar: board 12 could be a small pickup and 14 is good too; 13 is a big board|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Now S has a bidding problem|pg||
nt|bagman: pass unlikely to be right so 2NT or 2@H?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|bagman: or maybe 2@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kingcur: I don't see S stopping short of game now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: 6 back to Holland meanwhile, and we're tight again!|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: 5 D is good with this Cl lay-out|pg||
nt|kingcur: South one off in 1NT, where the Dutch brought in 2NT|pg||
nt|fokal: there was a card taken by accident|pg||
nt|kingcur: it would be a véry lucky game for NS|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kingcur: not sure if Marion is allowed to pass this...|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|bagman: If 2NT was non forcing, I cannot see what extras N suddenly found for the raise|pg||
nt|barbyh: a sp lead sinks the ship|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|kingcur: well, they're in it...now Marion should bring it home|pg||
nt|kingcur: depending on the result of board 13, this could be very important|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bagman: Declarer might play for the @H9 to drop or clubs 3-3 she needs the club finesse in both cases|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kingcur: the match still awfully tight, so every imp counts|pg||
nt|fokal: I just went to the other room|pg||
nt|kingcur: specs inform me that France are in 6@C|pg||
nt|fokal: NS are playing 6 @c on board 13|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kingcur: which makes easily, so a well deserved 13 to France|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fokal: but there is stillswing option in board 15 and in this board|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|h3|nt|fokal: because it seems to me that NS are going to make 5 @d|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kingcur: playing the known card|pg||
nt|fokal: tough choice for N , doesn't want to go down with @c 5-2 and trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|kingcur: but with two trump losers, Marion has no other option but to play for either drop of @CJ or for @SQx|pg||
nt|fokal: but here she will win anyway I predict|pg||
nt|kingcur: so she will run home with 11 tricks, probably sighing with relief|pg||
nt|fokal: she isn't sure about the two trump losers|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kingcur: true|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d5|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fokal: so she can play @h ruff and trump|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|s2|pg||
mc|11|nt|fokal: then @s to the As and @c ruff|pg||
nt|kingcur: yes, Olivier, you're enirely correct|pg||
nt|kingcur: 12 to France, as announced|pg||
nt|kingcur: so 14 ahead, with three boards to go|pg||
