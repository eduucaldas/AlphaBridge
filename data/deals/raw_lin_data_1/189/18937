mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|blum1956: 5 nj 6 tricks probably|pg||

nt|roswolf: always lead a major against this bidding :) mind you i would have led a spade:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and i strongly dislike leading from a doubleton if pd didnt bid the suit|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tihana: i wonder why W didnt pass 4d doubled to hear first control from E?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|yke:  4NT clearly not asking for aces|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|davpro: Perhaps 4@h implied shortness (in @D)?|pg||
nt|yke:  maybe 4@S did|pg||
nt|yke:  4NT 0 or 3 aces, just guessing|pg||

nt|hedyg: and EW landed in 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: @S partscore to EW|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 27+5 = 32 teams will qualify for the knockouts. members of the eliminated teams can enjoy the open pairs event starting tomorrow|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|woozle: 6NT has chances with a spade lead - four spades, three hearts, three diamonds, one club and a squeeze on south|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but ns might get busy in h|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s was intermediate?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: but higher suit probably wins|pg||
mb|3C|nt|woozle: Fiona Brown is very cautious with her barren 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive reopening by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: 10-13 I am told ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: some may have doubled as east-t/o of course|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or 11-13 I am also told  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@C here on ice|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no CC for NS, soemthing between SEF and 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6nt from east cold as well|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jcomyn: not yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ntmon: .. now :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wikner/Kamras: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJK1.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this may not play too well|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|woozle: four rounds of spades now will put South through the wringer|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi knows his side has a fit - if opps have a 9-card fit you are guaranteed an 8-card fit at least - but that doesn't mean you will find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might bid 4@S with the W hand once he knows about 4 card support since he has no valid defense vs 4@H except the trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can be defeated|pg||
nt|roswolf: the swedes on the first bd bid to 5@D for a game swing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: A player of the team which is in best 8 will hardly lead a spade against 6NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the bidding could well go 1@s-2@s-4@S at other tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: well who does win now|pg||
nt|athene: west's defensive plan is very easy|pg||
nt|athene: just play spades and spades and spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: and get your three trump tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ilan Herbst went 2 off in OR|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would be better-off to double 3@S rather than bid 4@H, if he feels he has to do something|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think only -1 is likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: competenty done|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 13 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: 4@H should be a five-card suit in my opinion|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c7|nt|hedyg: he could not do that after his pd doubled 3@S, Bill|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ntmon: it's probable that EW will come to 4@S on many tables either on its own or pushed, but not doubled |pg||
nt|athene: no i mean in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that would be for minors, denying 4@Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is rare that pd, when he doubles 1@s, does not have 4 cards in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: not so rare these days for the top players|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all assume pd has 4 OM when he doubles a M opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is true enough|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|woozle: probably not, but leading from a nothing suit isn't completely safe either - can easily pick up (say) partner's queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody is very worried about the overtrick|pg||
mc|13|nt|jcomyn: levazza mean business by the looks of things|pg||

nt|tihana: answer to kibtzers: this is open european championship, so all are welcome.|pg||
nt|yke:  a kib confirms 4@S was asking for aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|davpro: Kibs are very helpfull. Unlike us they know stuff :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|tihana: majors|pg||
nt|tihana: E will probably invite game|pg||
nt|yke:  maybe 2@D 2@H 2@S as invitational|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tihana: 4@S game try|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  that's one way|pg||
nt|tihana: go strong|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|yke:  N should souble, sorry, with the club lead I was only kidding|pg||
nt|yke:  double|pg||
nt|tihana: E clubs seem better after double of 2cl, since cl lead is more desirable then diamond|pg||
nt|tihana: E hand|pg||
nt|yke:  without a double, meckstroth would probably lead a diamond|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|yke:  10 tricks now, two rounds of spades and ruff out the hearts|pg||
nt|tihana: or a spade?, trying to prevent ruffs of his heart holding? Although holding a @S J might prevent him from doing so.|pg||
nt|yke:  oh wait, there is a catch, no quick entry to the west hand for the second ruff|pg||
nt|yke:  I think he cannot make it|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yke:  if you ruff out the hearts you don;t have an entry to the west hand|pg||
nt|tihana: my gib says he can :)|pg||
nt|tihana: kib suggest throw in with a @SQ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yke:  maybe north get squeezed on the 4th round of hearts|pg||
nt|yke:  kind of ottlik backwash squeeze|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|yke:  very difficult hand|pg||
nt|davpro: yes|pg||
nt|davpro: therefor I'm speachless|pg||
nt|tihana: i think piekarek will make it.|pg||
nt|yke:  Rodwell could have ruffed with the Q of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|davpro: If anyone will make it it WILL be Piekarek. That's for syre|pg||
nt|davpro: :)|pg||
nt|tihana: he know north distribution by now|pg||
nt|yke:  I think N gets squeezed|pg||
nt|tihana: and diamond postion|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|yke:  AK of spades, ruff a club and the 4th heart|pg||
pc|s4|nt|davpro: 2 rounds of @s and crossruff will do it|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|yke:  small club now|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|c2|pg||

nt|MolvaM: so that 4@s wont make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Brown has an exciting hand but best defense can beat 4S|pg||
nt|roswolf: an imp is an imp is an imp so said a great player once|pg||
nt|hedyg: the official site is: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mcarroll: This will certainly see Major suit action|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ntmon: 4@S now by NS|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they get to 6|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H is normal here|pg||
nt|roswolf: another transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: anothr transfer|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: might inhibit the nat @H overcall by east |pg||
mb|d|nt|woozle: South's 2D looks competitively inadequate, not that it matters much here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tempting|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|blum1956: Probably it is a @h raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: may be showing 3@H support - the transfer shows 4+ in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would lead a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: the @SQ is looking for a brillancy prize|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: No doubt, and a toothpick is a weapon but it's not really adequate for a duel|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: but resisted|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told 1@c-1@d-1@h=3@h unball,1nt=2/3@hball|pg||
nt|roswolf: another vul game bash|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1st we bid it, then we try to make it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ntmon: S would need @D8 instead of @D7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: to try and set up hearts looks natural not that it will work|pg||
nt|hedyg: not enough transportation|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also the 3rd @s in the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but if 3-3 then enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: if there is a way Pepsi will find it|pg||
nt|roswolf: dd it is doomed i am told - looks it to me in practice as well|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|athene: this is a funny auction then - how did Bocchi know his partner had five hearts>|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: ?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: making now|pg||
nt|woozle: Brown had two options - lead the club early before the opponents know you have eight trumps, or run trumps and try to put on pressure|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|ntmon: or @D lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: maybe he didn't|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|blum1956: Maybe it were better to play the @cQ before trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: pepsi is east's nickname |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcarroll: True enough|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswrunda6.html|pg||
pc|hK|nt|woozle: Count signals should sort out the club suit for the defense when North has the ace|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: non-poles cant pronounce all the consonants in his name|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt shows 5 hearts i am told :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|sJ|pc|d7|nt|athene: yes i know 1@D shows hearts but only 4+ hearts|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: cutting his losses -1|pg||

pc|h5|pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|blum1956: It is difficult for defenders to make a mistake when they have some 7 free discards|pg||

pc|c7|pc|d3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dQ|pc|s9|pc|hT|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||

nt|yke:  acording to GIB|pg||
nt|tihana: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  see, I don;t need GIB :)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|athene: the winning line was to ruff the @C7 in dummy without cashing the king first, then ruff a heart; north gets squeezed|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|athene: if he throws the @DQ and comes down to the bare ace you can duck a diamond to set up the king and you still have the @CK as a stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if he keeps @DAQ he gets endplayed later|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|athene: when he ruffs a winning heart with his boss trump he has to give dummy the @DK|pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  well that was vertainly a great board|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|yke:  I think I got over 100 private messages the last board :)|pg||
nt|jr7: 7@S, not 7@D|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D balanced 8-10; 2nt stayman|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@D shows spades and 3@S sets the suit; now they are on their way, but the @DQ is a bit of a key card and that might be hard to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is  the Serious 3NT showing spade support and a good hand for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rodwell devised the Serious 3NT so he should know|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|athene: south is probably known not to have any kings after he has AA [8-10 for 2@D remember]|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so 6@D should ask for @DQ|pg||
nt|yke:  meckwell precision in action, it's only a question how they bid it, not if|pg||
nt|yke:  well|pg||
mb|7S|nt|athene: and if 5nt asks for kings anyway then 6@D has to ask for third round control somewhere|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tihana: nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D asking for 3rd round control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well done|pg||
nt|davpro: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meck showed all his 10 points|pg||
nt|tihana: claim|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|yke:  2@D was bal 2NT a relay, 3@D 4 spades, 3NT serious|pg||
nt|athene: just needs spades 3-2 doesn't it|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
mc|13|nt|athene: that's not good enough odds for a grand if they might not be in six in the other room|pg||

nt|roswolf: what 3@H would mean is a mystery:)|pg||
nt|athene: ok so with a 3nt bid and only four hearts, south would have done something else|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo responds 2@C on strong balanced hands with a 4-card major|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is to conceal the major if you don't have a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|athene: so if you respond showing a major then bid 3nt you promise 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: another kibber suggests they may use 3@S rebid by south as puppet to 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though NS are doing the same sort of thing|pg||

nt|hedyg: wd for -1?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|MolvaM: we would be happy if a few voids would be there but ok :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3C|pg||

nt|MolvaM: welldone tokay :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: great minds eh glen!?:)|pg||
nt|glen: hey, canadians own "eh"|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3nt seems routine by west|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: boy what happens now|pg||
nt|ntmon: when opps bid 2 suits and we look for 3NT, we bid the suit we have stopped |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 4+|pg||
nt|roswolf: a difficult salm to reach 6@D seems clearly superior|pg||
nt|athene: NS can bid lots of hearts but that will only encourage east to bid a slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok here is the CC for NS now: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/AWJKeng.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be awkward for n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: which is the awkward part?|pg||
mb|r|nt|ntmon: but i agree .. NS on the way to problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: the heart lead against nt is marked lucky east has 10xxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: getting to grand?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|woozle: At the other table, North switched to a diamond at trick two, but chose the lowest...South, duly misled, led one back|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S will make if the defence foolishly try to cash @HAK, but not if they switch to a club to take out the entry to the diamonds, of course|pg||
nt|glen: thanks Hedy, typical swedish cc, very little blank space left|pg||
mb|d|nt|MolvaM: heart lead and low spade switch?|pg||
nt|granguru:  and west @HJx|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: like well into the soup|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I'm still bidding 3c on the s hand before you have your blood spilled|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh then @sA disappears|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is on in many denominations and level is difficult to judge too|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ntmon: the only problem with 3@C is that should not be enough |pg||
nt|ntmon: at least they're on the same wavelenght|pg||
nt|roswolf: advance sac taken|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX doesnt even start to show this hand|pg||

nt|roswolf: i agree hedy|pg||
mb|6D|nt|MolvaM: even if misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|hedyg: anything is fine as long as they avoid 5@ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup i think duboin was taking the time to light the proverbial cigarette|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: much of a muchness|pg||
nt|glen: i thought they played for lavazza and coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the grand is missed i fear|pg||
nt|hedyg: Thomas thinks XX shows 3 @ss only|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 4 card fit and singleton @c he had other bids available|pg||
nt|roswolf: meckwell will probably have a similar challenge in the other room|pg||
pc|h4|nt|blum1956: clear pass for North on 2@s from my point of view, but Pszczola is a world champion which I am not|pg||

nt|tihana: easy 4 hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: we must wait for Meckstroth|pg||
nt|athene: did he go out for a smoke whilst Rodwell played the grand?|pg||
nt|athene: poor Rodwell, he knows if he plays a hand brilliantly his partner will never see it, he will be outside getting some "fresh air" :)|pg||
nt|davpro: But on the other hand if he plays it very bad....P will find out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: ok he's back|pg||

nt|ntmon: the wrong result for Monacco atributed to their EW pair in OR|pg||
nt|athene: better lead a diamond against 6@H here|pg||
nt|granguru:  1Nt or 2@D NS|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: yes for once not a lot of scope for action|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Lots of work|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lots of work needed|pg||
nt|ntmon: leader changes after each board |pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be too hard though|pg||
nt|roswolf: another distributional fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: another pretty hand but only enough for game|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|woozle: only two certain losers, but I'm not sure how many winners|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the @D lead signposted|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is GF raise with singleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D shows 1 singleton(unspecified) + gf i am told|pg||
nt|athene: some specs might be wondering why east didn't just double|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: there are two possible explanations|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: finding h here will be tricky|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and game on|pg||
nt|athene: firstly they might play x as t/o of hearts (unlikely)|pg||
nt|glen: the modern style: bid five card majors, count points later|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= semi-forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT general gametrial..|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: secondly he just wants to emphasize he has real playing strength in diamonds so there might be a sac|pg||
nt|glen: the semi-forcing NT allows for opener, once having counted points, to pass to avoid trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: the term semi-forcing will always be a puzzle to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy +90|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus it is NOT forcing?|pg||
nt|hedyg: or just 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: whereas a lead-directing double could be as little as @DKQ10x or so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ntmon: much depends on methods now|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice no XX from Gino to show Kx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean: it is either forcing or it isnt?|pg||
nt|granguru:  correct|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1NT conventionally asks for point count? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: well your supposed to bid again if you have a decent hand very like drury without the guaranteed trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: , see above |pg||
nt|glen: semi-forcing is a terrible term, but was meant to distinguish between 1NT not-forcing limited to about 10 pts, and the modern style where it can have game invite values|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blum1956: not enough entries to make the @d s work and too bad @h distribution to crossruff effectively|pg||
nt|woozle: On the last board, Harding in the other room tried 3NT with the matching 4333s - down one also, but had chances for 10 in|pg||
nt|roswolf: brakes need to be applied now|pg||
nt|roswolf: simple auction|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: it is a terrible term indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but rarely does in my experience|pg||
nt|granguru:  for me semif means "you may pass if you have a sub min hand  or a min with a bal distr"|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: OTT|pg||
nt|athene: i guess one other advantage for 4@D over double is it takes some room away from opps|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: which red suit to try is the question|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ntmon: very lucky for NS|pg||
pc|hK|nt|woozle: A bit sad here that the third diamond will be ruffed with the short defensive trumps|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: ok, it looks here as though madala has shown a diamond control|pg||

nt|jcomyn: probably and then 3d forcing with at least 5-5|pg||
nt|hedyg: a Zia cuebid of 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: is bocchi teaching madala some interesting italian phrases at high speed now? if so, chances are, it was south's fault|pg||
nt|roswolf: another routine game hand|pg||
nt|glen: may see some italian science here|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it has some second meaning here. idont have a great hand and 3cards to raise you|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: didnt work - it is good to see that the top players are also mere mortals:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|MolvaM: maybe the 4-1 trumps could bring some action|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could get feisty|pg||

mb|1H|an| |nt|hedyg: we have been seeing a lot of that|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|glen: 2@C is the science|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|athene: 2@C is a reverse inverted minor - it shows a raise to the two-level|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@c rather than 1@d was an interesting choice|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 4 Fantunes in 7@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: natural or 16/17+ many hand types|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Pepsi bids only 2NT...he apparently has lower standards for vulnerable 2H bids than I do|pg||
nt|woozle: Seamon-Molson raises to say "yes, I did overcall vulnerable"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and the @S Ten is a vital asset|pg||
nt|woozle: I suppose she would never have raised without it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now thats aggressive but i suppose the 5-card suit is useful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ntmon: actually E hand is rather strong in 15-17 range|pg||
nt|ntmon: roles home now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rolls even|pg||
nt|ntmon: rolls* :)|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S was natural, usually 2@Ss, less than 8|pg||
nt|roswolf: for once i understand their bidding:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|glen: 3@H was the big hand, natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c either nat or any strong hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: according to the CC|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: then 3@H= strong hand with @s+@H|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: i didnt expect this contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: should go -1|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||

pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: and bocchi-Madala found that defence in open room|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: if the 3@D bid had been gf, then it would have been a forcing pass|pg||
nt|athene: it's reasonable enough to play pass forcing if you showed at least game invite values and opps go to 5-level; 99% of the time they are advance saccing|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Just one more week to go :)|pg||
nt|athene: now if declarer has the @DK and north has the @HQ meckstroth has to lead a heart - but there isn't really a guess for declarer after the 1nt overcall|pg||

mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: yes normal contract |pg||
nt|athene: but we just don't know the NS agreements here (or i don't anyway) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: lots of hcp but not much chance of a slam|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: if west just holds up his @SA isn't he beating 5@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is, needs to hold up twice|pg||
nt|athene: he ducks twice - now if bocchi plays another trump he takes the ace and plays a fourth and the club ruff goes|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called , Ginossar think 5s was -1 |pg||
nt|athene: if bocchi ruffs a club himself, then west can simply force the south hand in clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: Tadeusz, did Gino duck the A@S?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe bocchi claimed 11 or something and west agreed without really thinking it through|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely though|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but fatigue does play its part|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that unlikely, only 4-0 @ss could beat him|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might well have played a @s from hand and claimed|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: Well i haven't seen , Bocchi has just claimed|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so we will wait, once declarer claims all play stops and you call the TD if you dont agree|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: We are waiting for decision |pg||
nt|roswolf: one fir the bulletin i think as do a few others!:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: might try 3nt here a behind bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: living thru this at the table is bad, but worse will come during scoring when you say minus 1400 |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt much superior|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|woozle: McGann has been there before - the big preempt putting pressure on NS in exchange for losing an occasional miracle slam|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s on the previous bd are playing in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: IN THE OTHER ROOM|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: lots of controls in n hand why not 2nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Pepsi chooses to go quietly with his 17-count, fearing that a double will be pulled too often|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice judgment here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well it must be makable since NS took 11 tricks here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: e/w will need a lot of the captain's coffee at the end of this match she wont be very sympathetic|pg||

nt|blum1956: This is a partscore board besides McGann has another opinion))|pg||

nt|MolvaM: action again|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and chosen|pg||
nt|hedyg: they do play Ghestem on their CC|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes partner has good diamonds and weak hearts and you can make 4@S but not 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: just maybe not with @cs|pg||
nt|athene: throwing hearts on diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what now - dicey|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this wont go for 1400 but in context a similar result|pg||

nt|roswolf: north needs to avoid being endplayed here|pg||
