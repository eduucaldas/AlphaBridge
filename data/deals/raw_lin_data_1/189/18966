nt|Walddk6: Our operator is the one and only Maria. She is second to none|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: ty :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|rmb1: Simplest defence is just to continue spades, a diamond may be too active|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: it's so nice to hear that, but our comentators are great too :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult to say much about the auction : and declaring/defending 1NT is often unclear :( |pg||

nt|stc: hi, Place 25(89VP) against place 29(86), a large win will probably qualify|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mamos: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: I would guess that Kanin qualifies with a win and Consus needs something better to qualify|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 25 vs 29 - 27 teams from A go on to the KO stage|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpld: hi all:)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|jbgood: and 5 from B|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade lead would give the 10th trick here|pg||
nt|jbgood: and duly found|pg||
nt|rcerreto: only an unlikely @h lead would surely set|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stc: now home, down on a @H lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@s was a good save|pg||
nt|bagman: South holds a good looking hand for a nonvulnerable preempt and can go to 4NT and expect to make it|pg||

pc|s8|nt|bagman: The defense has to play on the assumption that the contract can be set and might give an overtrick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|c6|pg||

nt|jcomyn: can clubs push major too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bagman: the -50 EW paid is 50 better than the par (4@DX -100); might earn a couple of IMPs|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bagman: Dangerous, sure, but the Opps steal you blind if you pass with that|pg||
nt|jbgood: i would rather double - too little intermediates|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos: most European pairs would act with West either Multi or Weak Two|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: so a forcing NT from South  and a rather uncomfortable 3-3 partscore :(|pg||
nt|jcomyn: push themselves too high|pg||
mb|4S|nt|stc: looks like -2 or -3|pg||
nt|jbgood: cannot pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: I am also for X, AJxx and Axx in majors look OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: We might discuss about the relative merits of X and 1NT for quite long. In my opinion both have flaws and it's just the matter of taste and style|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes, me too|pg||
nt|jbgood: Consus went down at both tables on the prev one - so another 4 imps for kaninen|pg||
nt|stc: A @c trick stolen, he has 5 sure tricks now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay:  btw: what is the reason for relay, instead of 3N?|pg||
nt|szalay:  IO dont like to cpmplicate things|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oqfrunda1.html|pg||
nt|szalay:  may be I am simple minded|pg||
nt|rmb1: could be 19 opposite 14?|pg||
nt|szalay:  in tat case he wont pass 3N, I think|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|szalay:  If I wd go to 3N opposite 11, he will go on with 17-19, no doubt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davpro: @h lead would suit the Swedes (i.e. me)|pg||
nt|szalay:  its likely 300, may be 500, doesnt matter|pg||
pc|d6|nt|szalay:  to lead away kings is very risky|pg||

nt|szalay:  if it ends 300: Swedes need 24 IMPs (just 4000+ points combined)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: the next round should begin at 15:30, so in 70minutes :)|pg||
nt|szalay:  if 500: just 18 enough for tiebreak|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: The best thing South can do now is to lead the @cK and a club. North leads another heart but declarer wins this with the Ace and leads a club discarding a heart from his hand|pg||

nt|mamos: an unlucky hand for EW|pg||
nt|panja: NS could even make 10 tricks in @S, I guess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: perfectly ok in clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3nt next hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: but will play in hearts of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: but -1 in4@h is most likely|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|panja: 4@H might make on a friendly lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont likje that 2s vul but thats what it says on the tin i suppose|pg||
nt|mamos: less likely after @s bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcarroll: OR only on board 22 but looks like opportunity running out for Rosental|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: dont like 5@c |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: now look what he did|pg||
nt|panja: what if S doubles and leads a @H?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcomyn: he will and he wont|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|panja: one down is certain though..|pg||

nt|blum1956: So if Fredin had guessed the diamond position in 5@c contract and Silverstein had not let the 5@c doubled through the final result could be different|pg||
