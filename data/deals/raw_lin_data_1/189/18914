pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: different wrong contract reached at the other table - I guess 3NT was just too tough to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C in the other room also went down -- 3N is the spot here but not easy to reach with huge fits in 2 suits|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Big match, Mahaffey currently 1st in Group E at 91 VPs, and Helle close behind in 2nd at 86|pg||
nt|jcomyn: any funny stories about Paddy the Irishman, Paddy the Portuguese and Paddy the Turk|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl1: problem with hands|pg||

mb|d|nt|oosmanb: This 3@C might imply fit?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  27 places out of this swiss to playoffs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|MolvaM: 27 teams from swiss-A, and 5 teams from swiss-B|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after 7 matches will have been played|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so the knockouts start monday|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: maybe not fit, as Bryant wouldve bid 4@S not dbl|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Mile|pg||
nt|mcsd: doubleing Pepsi in 4@H is not a good idea|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Mike*|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Dbling Pepsi in ANYTHING is not a good idea|pg||
nt|jr7: No names - but now are we playing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  4@h seems resonable|pg||
mb|d|nt|oosmanb: Get those @D ruffs going fast!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yes unless we NS get those ruffs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and even then would probably lose imps to vul 4@S |pg||
nt|mcsd: a@d would be a great lead, or switch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: they'll all be bridge-weary by then|pg||
nt|jcomyn: might sdhoot 3nt|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2d X wont bring @h into play|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jfaria:  playing in nt will meet an unfavorable @h break |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: nor aqny comment needed either. these mundane 3nt should be abolished|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: mmm 9 tricks in n t|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jfaria:  2@c must be some kinf|pg||
nt|jfaria:  kind of good hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: here is the running score page http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 46 teams playing in group A, and 74 teams in B|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oosmanb: oh dear|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if you think about it - why bother when 30 tablesd will play in 3nt|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jfaria:  now lets se the lead...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Play in @H all that matters now|pg||
nt|mamos: NS are pair based in England Rob Helle Dutch  lives and works a lot of the time now in Poland  -- a great funloving guy with wit and charm  |pg||
nt|jr7: first he play @C|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Oh wow I was wrong. 4@H +1 in other room!!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|jfaria:  yestarday a leaing british master was telling that unsoported leading honours are underrated|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jfaria:  he defended a honour lead from this holdong|pg||
nt|jfaria:  based on computer simulation|pg||
nt|jfaria:  looks like he was right this time|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Moment of truth|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Will go up I think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but Dbl ..|pg||
nt|mcsd: may be tat dbl is good idea after all :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I really dont know what the right play is, so I'll back whatever Pepsi decides|pg||
nt|mcsd: now lets anylise, S is known to hold 5+@S 2+@C probably more|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Seems like North has 7@C 3@S but 1@D 2@H or 2@D 1@H?|pg||
nt|mcsd: hard to imagine that he would double without a@D , dso that goes for 10-11 known cards|pg||
nt|oosmanb: technically could be 6@C 3@S 2-2 3-1 1-3 as well?|pg||
nt|mcsd: so etleast 2@H going up with K is more then 80%|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Mustafa Tokay and Baldursson playing for team Lavazza|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|xenya: good hand for Bidding Challenge|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: though I suppose, if they cash a heart and shift to a spade, you might not make it|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|xenya: 1@H is probably @Ss|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, that would beat 5@C|pg||
nt|dburn: or even if they don't cash the heart first, I guess - surprised that Sun didn't double the 1@h response, but maybe he doesn't play that as hearts|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dburn: 5@c was reached in the other room and was down two - no doubt declarer, trying to make it, overtook the jack of diamonds after drawing trumps|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: and that collapsed two of his winners into one|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps he drew two trumps, then tried to cash three diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: W may not find the spade switch now|pg||

pc|c7|pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|dburn: or makes a mistake|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sQ|nt|xenya: note that the @S10 from Sun would have been disastrous for the defence -- E would have been squeezed|pg||

nt|vugraphpl1: i have E |pg||
nt|vugraphpl1: it's problem.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@s wasnt entirely straight forward btw, specially on a @d lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in the other room Rodwell never introduced @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well I suppose an imp is an imp|pg||
nt|jcomyn: easy c game|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: so Meck didnt bid past 3@S, didnt dbl 4@H, and they didnt set 4@H either|pg||
nt|jfaria:  it prooved hard to get together @c quality and @d stopper , i guess|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcomyn: this could be a big ouch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 4 tens hcp|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|jcomyn: what does 1t mean|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: This looks like limit bid with 5+@D ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1nt|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jr7: 1M + 1m|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  despite the bonnus lead think 4@h was a winnner, last board|pg||
nt|oosmanb: unless they're on a different system altogether|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Oh precision|pg||
nt|jcomyn: vul - gee whiz i AM getting old|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: so GF with @D?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jfaria:  now or never situation :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: NS play Tarzan Precision like Wijs Muller|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosmanb: The deal numbers are loaded wrong I think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 11-20 that's why|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone like this contract - i dont|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Decent contract, should be able to handle bad trump break|pg||
nt|vugraphpl1: I must give 2 pass. W is dealer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Sorry folks|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of relays|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm getting a lot of help from kibs, appreciate it. 2@H relay|pg||
nt|mamos: yes :)|pg||
nt|mcsd: when the auction ends declarer lets tarzan screem?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: atleast NT right sided|pg||
nt|oosmanb: now they need to stop in 3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jfaria:  we lost the more interesting chalenge in 4@s..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oosmanb: I'm being helped by Ant Edwards, perhaps 2@S is high shortage, and 3@D 2-3-5-3 exactly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: they have im sure|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: terence reese once said 4 to the 9 is NOT a suit - and i agree|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|jr7: @D8 will call for @S - as I play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oosmanb: He's trying to cross ruff the whole hand|pg||

pc|d7|pg||

nt|mcsd: 4333?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what 2d is|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: the info is not likely to help them|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcsd: o boith sides|pg||
nt|mcsd: late Reese, was against it so om from that school. |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|oosb: yeah 2 @S tricks and 1@C for defence|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jr7: next play :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: all very clever - as usual|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|oosmanb: overtricks now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats why such a good idea to pre-empth only when u have nothing outside|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jr7: 2@D is "reverse" in DK - color + ekstra HP|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|oosmanb: Guys is everyone leading Q@C/J@C?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me one|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d3|nt|mcsd: it is nothing wrong in the auction, but it is not my style.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jfaria:  maybe , plying MP Ivanov could delay his decision about what game to play...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h8|pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: although tempting to lead a s|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|fabsayc: defense with knowledge of 4333 should continue club when diamond ducked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but they did not :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ALOT of tables opened 3NT as East|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wouldn't matter would it?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  last hand now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: last bd will probably be flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in fact he should have returned spade trick 2, then declarer has no chance|pg||
nt|mamos: Oosman makes an interesting point    -- but against gambling 3NT defence needs to win tricks quickly   or contract will make  almost certainly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not to mention right-siding it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: 9+9 = game??|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Infact 17 tables had Q@C led against 3NT from East (so far)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jfaria:  must be @h|pg||
nt|mcsd: so the 4@H goes down 2, nowhere to discard anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  now a cue from W asking 4 a @h stopper|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and 13 led 4th highest @C !|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well that i will never lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Which also means that 30 tables opened 3NT as EAST!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mcsd: e-w may get too high on this hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcsd: sorry -1, i counted @H for 2 loosers|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think chineese team has mostly to complain about wrong choices... Sementa & Duboin colected|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcomyn: more like a poker classic|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mcsd: there is a possibility of makinh 6@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|jcomyn: wonder what happens if he does not have h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: easdt|pg||
nt|jfaria:  24 imps in 2 very hugly slams is too much in a short match|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: On a low club, anyone make?  Could declarer reason: "they always lead aces against gambling 3NT, so he doesn't have @CA, so I play low from dummy"?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: most interesting though, is that 3-4 declarers played 10@c on small @C lead!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: that's some read.!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jfaria:  strange, was expecting last round to be reversed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  meaning 3@s from W and 3nt by E|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jfaria:  but maybe 3@s would accept @h ...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: lot of work|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ropey 3nt i suppose|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|h3|nt|bigtrain: 10 is clear imo....  generally speaking an ace is lead if held vs gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah, answers my question - but it has a lot of logic in a top-class field|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcsd: good play ny ivanov|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3nt +3 is worth a fortune!|pg||
nt|mcsd: and atop so far|pg||
