nt|jtr: We can play a little game-Guess the System|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the 5th round of 7 of a one-day Swiss tournament, to reduce the field to 32 teams for the KO stages.|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like standard to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is  Cullin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cullin-Upmark are members of the strong Sweden open team|pg||
nt|jtr: Carrot Standard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Per-Ola is his first name :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cullin pls Joanna|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: sorry :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: They play a strong club system with zz responses|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: zz  A = 3  K = 2  Q = 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lavazza lies high in the rankings, around 4th.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Kamras are marked as 6th on the results site quoted by Roland a moment ago.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D is either negative or posive with diamonds and at least 3 zz's|pg||
nt|jtr: In that case Roland, why the 1@d response?|pg||
nt|jtr: ah ok ty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Read above|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North-South looking for a game, despite the strong 1@C against them.|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Peter Lund|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W are also interested in game. |pg||
nt|jtr: 3NT did not work well next door|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jtr: Hello peter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Upmark now showing the strong option of the 1@D response|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: ...which is presumably game-forcing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well done by the Swedes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brolucius: A spade ruff would defeat 4@H, since there would still be a club loser. 5@H doubled is therefore too expensive.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kamras is the non-playing captain, also the NPC of the Sweden open team for many years|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: @DQ could be worthless and N/S have a very good fit in clubs. South had plenty of losers and 4@S would be too much.|pg||
nt|jtr: @c switch and declarer needs to play trumps for the top|pg||
nt|brolucius: They say you should 'always' bid a major-suit game with a 6-4 fit, but North was likely to hold only 3-card support for his 2@S raise.|pg||
nt|jtr: Assuming East ducks of course|pg||
nt|jtr: Meckwell say a 6-3 fit is enough|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: They think 22 points is enough for 3NT, though.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some play in 2-1 at the 4 level, Sabine Auken's Venice Cup debut for example (read today's bulletin)|pg||

nt|brolucius: I need not comment on punctuation, Roland, since we have the expert on such matters with us. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, Burn is not online|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|woozle: 6NT has chances with a spade lead - four spades, three hearts, three diamonds, one club and a squeeze on south|pg||

nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s was intermediate?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: but higher suit probably wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Fiona Brown is very cautious with her barren 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive reopening by north|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: 10-13 I am told ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: some may have doubled as east-t/o of course|pg||

pc|dK|nt|roswolf: this may not play too well|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|woozle: four rounds of spades now will put South through the wringer|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi knows his side has a fit - if opps have a 9-card fit you are guaranteed an 8-card fit at least - but that doesn't mean you will find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might bid 4@S with the W hand once he knows about 4 card support since he has no valid defense vs 4@H except the trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can be defeated|pg||
nt|roswolf: the swedes on the first bd bid to 5@D for a game swing|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|blum1956: A player of the team which is in best 8 will hardly lead a spade against 6NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the bidding could well go 1@s-2@s-4@S at other tables|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well who does win now|pg||
nt|athene: west's defensive plan is very easy|pg||
nt|athene: just play spades and spades and spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: and get your three trump tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ilan Herbst went 2 off in OR|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would be better-off to double 3@S rather than bid 4@H, if he feels he has to do something|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think only -1 is likely here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H should be a five-card suit in my opinion|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: he could not do that after his pd doubled 3@S, Bill|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's probable that EW will come to 4@S on many tables either on its own or pushed, but not doubled |pg||
nt|athene: no i mean in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that would be for minors, denying 4@Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is rare that pd, when he doubles 1@s, does not have 4 cards in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: not so rare these days for the top players|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all assume pd has 4 OM when he doubles a M opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is true enough|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|s2|nt|woozle: probably not, but leading from a nothing suit isn't completely safe either - can easily pick up (say) partner's queen|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: levazza mean business by the looks of things|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: ace and another trump lookes obvious as he wasnt in 4|pg||
nt|glen: should declarer have played @S ace then @s|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think doubling just says you don't have the offensive potential in hearts to commit to bidding 4 over 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not good for south|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment bill|pg||
nt|athene: so you  can still have auctions like 1@S X 3@S X pass 4minor pass 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: saying ok, we might want to play here, but we don't have to|pg||
nt|roswolf: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
mc|8|nt|MolvaM: greed?|pg||

nt|pelu: 1Nt with 6/7 both way?|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: Ace and another trump, on the last hand, might fail when East held @SK-x-x and could draw a third round of trumps. Declarer would not then be able to ruff the last club (he could ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: try the heart finesse instead). But the club situation was clear after the first round and I am sure that declarer's play was correct.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: That is a falacy David|pg||
nt|jtr: if he has 3 trumps and a doubleton @c you cant make it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three trumps with the long clubs.|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah Kxx@ss onside you mean?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Yes true so maybe you should not play a @h before trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, East (on the right of the diagram, as DB2 would say...)|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@D shows 1 singleton(unspecified) + gf i am told|pg||
nt|athene: some specs might be wondering why east didn't just double|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: there are two possible explanations|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: finding h here will be tricky|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and game on|pg||
nt|athene: firstly they might play x as t/o of hearts (unlikely)|pg||
nt|glen: the modern style: bid five card majors, count points later|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= semi-forcing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: secondly he just wants to emphasize he has real playing strength in diamonds so there might be a sac|pg||
nt|glen: the semi-forcing NT allows for opener, once having counted points, to pass to avoid trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: the term semi-forcing will always be a puzzle to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy +90|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus it is NOT forcing?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: whereas a lead-directing double could be as little as @DKQ10x or so|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ntmon: much depends on methods now|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice no XX from Gino to show Kx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean: it is either forcing or it isnt?|pg||
nt|granguru:  correct|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 1NT conventionally asks for point count? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: well your supposed to bid again if you have a decent hand very like drury without the guaranteed trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: , see above |pg||
nt|glen: semi-forcing is a terrible term, but was meant to distinguish between 1NT not-forcing limited to about 10 pts, and the modern style where it can have game invite values|pg||
pc|h9|nt|blum1956: not enough entries to make the @d s work and too bad @h distribution to crossruff effectively|pg||
nt|woozle: On the last board, Harding in the other room tried 3NT with the matching 4333s - down one also, but had chances for 10 in|pg||
nt|roswolf: brakes need to be applied now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: it is a terrible term indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but rarely does in my experience|pg||
nt|granguru:  for me semif means "you may pass if you have a sub min hand  or a min with a bal distr"|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: OTT|pg||
nt|athene: i guess one other advantage for 4@D over double is it takes some room away from opps|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: which red suit to try is the question|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: if the 3@D bid had been gf, then it would have been a forcing pass|pg||
nt|athene: it's reasonable enough to play pass forcing if you showed at least game invite values and opps go to 5-level; 99% of the time they are advance saccing|pg||

nt|jtr: I like 2@c-a lot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No respect, they keep doubling them|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sementa did not like to bid 2@C after his previous experience in 2@D doubled.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and now they will collect another 500|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's worth 9 IMPs|pg||
nt|jtr: Sweden have capitalised on the errors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 IMPs, apologies|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players would not be able to bid 2@C on those values. You can, David? What does such a bid show for you?|pg||
nt|jtr: Natural and non forcing|pg||
nt|jtr: All good hands have to start with a redouble|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not at all invitational, then? Many players use a new suit bid as forcing. In the US, such bids tend to be forcing at the one-level and NF at the two-level.|pg||
nt|jtr: Not invitational because no xx Could be up to 10 though maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends on agreement. Some just ignore the double and bid as if there that been a pass|pg||
nt|jtr: I just like to bid a suit when i have a decent one:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, most in UK do that. (As Roland mentioned.)|pg||
nt|jtr: The method i like is pass is either weak or game forcing|pg||

nt|brolucius: 4@H is not the world's most appalling contract and did have some play. Only the bad trump break has made it look much too high.|pg||
nt|jtr: Should have played @ds earlier|pg||
nt|jtr: That @h10 looked suspicious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, there is a rebate for the extra downtrick, only 14 instead of 12|pg||
nt|pelu: and the X confirm :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Lavazza are really cleaning up then in a sense?:)|pg||
nt|pelu: still 2 boards to go :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Any commentators who happen to come from Scandinavia will be well chuffed by this score-line. (Unless, just possibly, there is some rivalry between the different countries...)|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure there is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed, but then there is the advantage of being Danish/Swedish like me|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have that people say 'I don't care where we come, so long as it is ahead of Denmark.'|pg||
nt|jtr: The 'green sickness' seems more prevalent between neighbouring countries|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has successfully avoided going down so far.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danes render quite a service with regard to Swedes. There is a sign by the harbour. It reads: "Keep Denmark clean, see a Swede to the ferry"|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: yes normal contract |pg||
nt|athene: but we just don't know the NS agreements here (or i don't anyway) :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: lots of hcp but not much chance of a slam|pg||
nt|athene: i don't understand the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: if west just holds up his @SA isn't he beating 5@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is, needs to hold up twice|pg||
nt|athene: he ducks twice - now if bocchi plays another trump he takes the ace and plays a fourth and the club ruff goes|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: TD was called , Ginossar think 5s was -1 |pg||
nt|athene: if bocchi ruffs a club himself, then west can simply force the south hand in clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: Tadeusz, did Gino duck the A@S?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe bocchi claimed 11 or something and west agreed without really thinking it through|pg||
nt|athene: seems unlikely though|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but fatigue does play its part|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that unlikely, only 4-0 @ss could beat him|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might well have played a @s from hand and claimed|pg||
nt|VugraphPLA: Well i haven't seen , Bocchi has just claimed|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so we will wait, once declarer claims all play stops and you call the TD if you dont agree|pg||

nt|roswolf: IN THE OTHER ROOM|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: lots of controls in n hand why not 2nt|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|woozle: Pepsi chooses to go quietly with his 17-count, fearing that a double will be pulled too often|pg||

nt|roswolf: but to be fair this is a very RARE mistake by these guys and they have plenty of imps in the bank from similar errors from past opps|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: and chosen|pg||

nt|athene: throwing hearts on diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what now - dicey|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this wont go for 1400 but in context a similar result|pg||

mb|1N|nt|glen: some styles like a 3rd seat 1@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: new leader - i didn't tell that during last few boards|pg||
nt|hedyg: not when KJ are behind :p|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcarroll: yet another Major partscore hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/oswleaderb.html|pg||
nt|athene: west might try an aggressive 3@S now, thinking his @DKJx mesh nicely with his partner's diamond suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in fact, of course, they mesh nicely with *north's* diamond suit|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 2@C then 2@S i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: the pitiful crutch of 4SF |pg||
nt|athene: show an invitational hand but stop at the 2 level|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and not 5 minutes after conceding 1400|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 37 minutes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: n/s will press on to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|woozle: 4S is cold|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s could be made|pg||
nt|woozle: with CA onside, diamond position, spade position and no diamond ruff coming|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@C may not be wise - who has the @S suit? probably partner, and is weak ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big finish for someone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it isnt lavazza|pg||
nt|ntmon: .. but this is not the case|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes but has to get @Ds right|pg||
nt|hedyg: can not be more than invite by passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: frying pan into the toaster|pg||
nt|athene: nope, he tries 3 anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will accept!?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|woozle: McGann tries 4H, down one or two on a spade guess with the club hook failing|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 2@s should be enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: everything is friendly|pg||
nt|granguru:  Italoswiss is a kib with very good memory|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|woozle: down one...Fiona surely won't try the SK now|pg||
nt|blum1956: -50 against -140 or -170 is a useful 3 imps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ntmon: X should secure @C lead against 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 card out of 3 is on side|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: craziest contract of the week|pg||
nt|roswolf: north needs to avoid being endplayed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think he can get endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: endplay is unlikely because after ruffing a club and drawing trumps, west has no trumps left so a fourth club is fine|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: even A@H and @H is fine|pg||
pc|dK|nt|woozle: I fear at this point that 3 isn't enough|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|ntmon: prediction? abstain..|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed as it happens but still care needs to be taken|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope no children are watching|pg||
nt|granguru:  some time ago I said whenever one player of each team tries to play the same suit, one of them is out of his mind. I was referring myself to the play of the cards thou|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|woozle: South could try for down two by ducking the first club|pg||
nt|athene: maybe @S6-@S4 is a subtle signal asking for a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: but bocchi can see it doesn't really matter i think|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|c2|nt|blum1956: Yes they need average 10.6 a bord to even the match|pg||
nt|athene: diamonds can't be going away|pg||
mc|10|nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|granguru:  bye all|pg||
pg||
