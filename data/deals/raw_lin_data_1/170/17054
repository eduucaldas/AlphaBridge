nt|lestergold: what fun and games arfe we in for here?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of man?|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: a pretty scary 2N|pg||
nt|lestergold: bonkers|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and that was just the bid that S wanted to hear |pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: south says why bid my known 8 card fit when i will probaBLY BUY A LOW SINGLETON IN MY SUIT|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I think I would bid 3@d intending to bid 3@S over 3@h.|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has had enough |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well so far my prediction looks corfrect|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sarkar_suk: hi sudhir :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: That's the theory.|pg||
nt|lestergold: auctio0n called for a trump lead|pg||

pc|s7|nt|am007: little too ambitious|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: really?|pg||
nt|xenya: so the defence seems to have thrown 2 tricks here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|santyclz: The auction called for a trump lead.  In addition, the more unbalanced opening leader's hand is, the more the trump lead is appropriate.  0 for 2.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: you can read north's distribution on the auction and you know that hearts will be ruffed in dummy|pg||
