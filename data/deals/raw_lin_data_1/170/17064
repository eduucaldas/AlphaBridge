pc|hA|pg||
nt|gavin:  seems like guessing trumps wont be difficult|pg||
nt|gavin:  with the 1@H opener west is likely to be shorter in spades|pg||

nt|athene: without killing a menace?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|gavin:  complicated questions :)|pg||
nt|athene: could try conceding the fourth diamond but if you have to lose a diamond AND a spade, they can play 2xclubs|pg||
nt|athene: and break the squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: basically when life gives you two 4333 hands it is telling you to play in 3nt :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  i have sympathy for south|pg||
nt|gavin:  not wanting to declare 3nt facing possible short hearts in partners hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  but i think the 3@H bid signified a balanced-ish hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  since they didnt bid 2@S, 3@C or 3@D|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|athene: if 2@H promised four spades then maybe south could offer 3nt over 3@H|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: but these auctions are tricky|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|gavin:  2@H here just said they have too strong of a hand to bid a suit naturally|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: he might well have preferred to try the known 43 spade fit|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin:  since they are a passed hand, its showing something around 10-11, or maybe compensating distribution|pg||
nt|gavin:  I like 2@H and 3@H here|pg||
nt|gavin:  its souths action over 3@H that was close|pg||
nt|gavin:  he had a lot of information about norths hand, balanced hand, no heart stopper, enough for game|pg||
nt|gavin:  north had denied 4@S with the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|gavin:  its easy to see some hands that are 3-2-4-4 where 4@S is better|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, he seems to have bypassed 3NT because of that bad spade suit|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: since boards are NOT duplicated across matches -- if teams finish early, they can restart early|pg||
nt|dburn: at single dummy, of course, Brogeland isn't cold for five, so he has something about which to think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: typically 15 minute break after final board complete|pg||

nt|dburn: maybe Duboin expected Sementa to bid 3NT with his actual hand|pg||

nt|dburn: depends a little on whether you play a 2@d opening as weak|pg||
nt|gavin:  and typically opening light with a minor is bad news|pg||
nt|athene: lauria could have ruffed, underled the spade, got another ruff|pg||

nt|ritong: could be a tad more than routine|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not really possible now, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: Brogeland needs to overtake this and play a heart, I think|pg||
nt|ritong: looks like a natural move|pg||
nt|dburn: even if West pitches a diamond, North just ruffs anyway and plays a club|pg||

pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzfb: sorry - spade was led long ago, and V has been thinking. Asks about lead - "from strength, 3rd and 5th"|pg||
