nt|brolucius: I heard about a great defense from Zia this morning. His partner, who had opened 4H led the @HA against a slam. Dummy went down with a singleton and Zia false-carded the @HK from ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: @HK-x. Declarer ruffed the next round high from A-K-Q-x and Zia's J-x-x in trumps was promoted. Brilliant!|pg||
nt|sybarra: not showing my age, just showing my knowledge of old movies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cayne match also exchanged about 100 imps last set for a negligible change in the match|pg||
nt|ritong: soooo...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms are visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ritong: apparently needs a @c lead to beat 4@s|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3rd Quarter results at  http://bridgewinners.com/round-of-8|pg||
nt|sybarra: you must open a brouser for each room  |pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-8|nt|yuval10: already some excitement, 6@d was made in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some commotion as other tables restart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss still studying.  deck may seem to have too many points in it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hamman had only a sevn-card suit but it might easily have been 8-card.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann asks about 4D.  Gitelman writes: "I think splinter"|pg||
nt|harmon: Hi all|pg||
nt|harmon: Team captain here so iahve to behave:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: hello everyone|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yuval10: 5NT is interesting, of course in standart bridge it means to pick between 6 or 7, but it doesn't seem likely considering West' strength|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess North might bid 4NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: West leaps to 4@S rather than tip his hand with a cue-bid response. Interesting. He makes life more difficult for N/S that way.|pg||
nt|dburn: intending to convert clubs to diamonds to show 6-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: with 5-5, he would bid diamonds at once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-8 HCP  or  9+ with no more than 1 King|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann exhales deeply. looks tired|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1NT by North is normally 12.5 - 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: green cards placed delicately on the tray|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar sees them when the tray comes back, puts his cards down and his hands to his temples|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: nice easy board to start the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar leans back, crosses his legs, still thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is great to see the top stars bid these competitive deals - a very difficult area for most of us.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue's strength limited by failure to open Precision @C|pg||
nt|ritong: and leading a @c from Jx is highly unlikely|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzfe: fingering @DA and @DQ|pg||
nt|ritong: +|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, diamonds may play better than hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: this probably isn't the real auction|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have no idea what is going on - looks like a transcription error|pg||
nt|sybarra: good flop as Henri says?|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with a potential trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads/carding  3rd/5th vs suit  4th vs NT    upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "sorry if this was wrong"|pg||
nt|harmon: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North passed, it would be|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: 6@d actually a lot better than 6NT, you can make it even when the K@h is off ( playing small @s from hand towards the Q, then if south doesn't jump you discard the K@s over the 4th ...|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c and if he does you can discard 2 @h's )|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|dburn: but both contracts have issues of trump control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lauria is asking about 4nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: to watch multiple tables: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|dburn: not Blackwood|pg||

pc|h2|nt|chorush: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: he needs an entry to his partners hand to beat this|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he doest|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has three top tricks - the club ruff is for down two|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess that after the ruff, Grue can pick up the hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he can handle it all|pg||
nt|ritong: he can|pg||
nt|ritong: fred has two @cs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Jacki: welcome Ira chorush|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Spade switch is clear, but West can give a suit preference card anyway.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|yuval10: here you have to rely on the @h finesse, but it worked so 2 imps for diamond |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss that 5N was pick a slam,  Gitelman thought it was choose 6 or 7|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Joanna, thanks |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chorush: This is an agressive 6 spade contract which might make on a good day, which this is not|pg||

nt|hedyg: picked up the Q@H?|pg||
nt|dburn: but judging by that, he did well|pg||
nt|brolucius: A splendid opening board for us.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry i just walked in and I'm afraid I missed the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: we lost our connection|pg||
nt|ritong: and we start with slammy hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the match ends with board 64 [unless tie]  winners play in Semi-Finals tomorrow   losers  maybe watch vugraph|pg||
nt|ritong: previous set was WoW about these|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chorush: hi Wayne|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: NS in the OR judged very well to bid to the 5 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N=good 14 to 17|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer to @D and 3 nt?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think they play   3@C=@D  [weak or FG]|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think brad will content himself with that, shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well Shirley's sequence should be mild slam try  otherwise just 1N-3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: matter of agreements re the transfer sequence|pg||
nt|ritong: there are other considerations|pg||
nt|sybarra: or another sequence maybe be game force stayman...and..|pg||
nt|ritong: one is moss' hand is really good and justifies more than a mild try|pg||
nt|ritong: an other is, when you transfer for @ds and bid 3NT afterwards, there must be a reason  for us, it shows @c shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room has already crashed once -- are we in holding pattern because of connection or is Brad in the tank?|pg||
mb|3C!|an|xfr|nt|dburn: don't worry - the play is not likely to be too fast for you to keep up with from now on|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is on page 240 of the system notes right? |pg||
nt|ritong: not really|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 142|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: We are all indebted to BBO for letting us watch these top tournaments free of charge. I hope they don't change their mind one day...|pg||
mb|3D|an|   |nt|yuval10: EW put maximum pressure over South|pg||
nt|hedyg: shhhhhhh! dont give them ideas!|pg||
nt|wstuart: Have Chips and Lew changed to a str NT vul?|pg||
nt|wstuart: *Chip|pg||
nt|chorush: yes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: always thinking  about chips?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: but it seem as if he has a 5@h now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: 1@c= 2+|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will still be free for commentators, Hedy. No need to worry.|pg||
nt|chorush: that dbl has just transformed this hand from something resembling a push to a swing for Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: chip wrote 12-14|pg||
nt|wstuart: He wrote 12-14 on the notepad the operator says.  This is very un-Chip-like.  He's a very aggressive player and I wouldn't expect him to downgrade a controlish 15 HCP, even though ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: it is 4333.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: well at least im here now for the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c looks like a decent contract - not easy to bid though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  4@H Ace Ask   taking control|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|ritong: a short fight, finally|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss grimaces a bit, points at dummy, still making plans|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i should say Key Card Ask      5@C=2 without Q|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ritong: shorter than next room, where EW pushed a bit|pg||
nt|chorush: It may only be 3rd 4th position vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: South must've been convinced that his Partner has void @s|pg||
nt|wstuart: At one time they played 12-14 in all seats *except* 3rd, where it was 15-17.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: on surface it looks like N's double meant to discourage his Partner of carry on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although if the kibitzers had to pay they would probably be less tolerant of the mistakes that the commentators make.|pg||
nt|dburn: optimistic, that - should South really have both majors stopped and the ace of clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: 1st leader change of the set  --  how many more will we see?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: still, this lead may let him escape for down only one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the result is an impossible 3NT in the wrong hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzfe: some question whether the 84-44 carryover is correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol no Liz|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is E/W bidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't make it with these cards, but maybe has more chance on the actual borad 3|pg||
nt|dburn: no, this is North-South bidding - they're just not bidding board 2 again|pg||
nt|harmon: theyve crossed rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: we got disconnected sorry|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzfe: moss:"just to show off"|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chorush: yes, and a fat 13 imps to Nickell|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: underbid|pg||
nt|ritong: i won t have time to develop about the transfer sequel|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to be critical, but perhaps it was "lazy" bidding at other table|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wstuart: No real problems discarding with Katz's hand.  Martel is hoping for a miracle, but it doesn't appear to be a religious holiday for him.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: A@S?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if one of the majors was bare, West might have made an unlucky choice of lead. It was adventurous bidding by N/S that could have worked better.|pg||
nt|dburn: true, and I guess if South had a couple of aces, the unstopped major might well be 4-4 anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
nt|dburn: downgrade previous comment to "mildly optimisitic"|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: was worth 4NT imho|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Henri |pg||
nt|sybarra: something more that 3 nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Bertens-Bakkeren 1N opener can be half point less at the top -- but still|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe even 3 @H cue?|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the fact that opener denied interest with 3@d enters the pic|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s8|nt|ritong: bertens decided slam was at best on a finesse, likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when transfer is any strength, rebid of 3@H/@S usually shows shortness|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he did play the A@S|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cT|pc|h9|nt|sybarra: cant Berten's make the cue in @H? |pg||
nt|sybarra: (other room)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ritong: it probably shows a shortness, either in @h or @s,according to agreement|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|harmon: excellent result|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, well bid|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: it comes from the fact that stayman was not used|pg||
pc|s5|nt|passell: they went very low in the other room|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: and thus, responder does not hold a 4M|pg||

nt|ferlema: ok|pg||
nt|wstuart: I would not have opened 1@H, either, unless in the context of a strong @C system.|pg||
nt|passell: 15 and a good 6 card suit seems too much to make a light invitation|pg||
nt|ritong: hi mike welcome|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chorush: Every conventional use of a bid has some downside. Stayman, probably the most uniformly played convention of all time, had a big downside on this hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yes we agreed on that point|pg||
nt|passell: hi   this is quite a match|pg||
nt|ritong: sure enough!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited by failure to open 1@C  -- and could be 5@H & 5@S|pg||
nt|passell: congrats to the Berg teams great performance througout this event|pg||
nt|passell: they were way to tough for me yesterday|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set was exactly 100 imps exchanged for net difference of about 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: we just threw the imps in the air|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: and they landed....|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|wstuart: So, I tihnk their NT in 3rd seat white is 12-14 (15-17 vul 4rd only).|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bertens overcalled 1N rather than Moss' DBL   looks close to me|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wstuart: I'm sure Stansby will upgrade this hand to a 15-17 NT evaluation.|pg||
nt|chorush: you are probably correct Wayne|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: kibitzer sits behind brad.  our first as opposed to the mob hovering at the zia-hamman table|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@s = @h, 9+, unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman, after sitting still for a minute, grabs the pass card off his tray|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@c = 4+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he had no real reason to get involved here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok -- i'm sure i would have bid 1N at the table|pg||
nt|ritong: and other potential swing|pg||
nt|passell: sorry i had to miss the last quarter|pg||
nt|ritong: gee|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: a strong @c?|pg||
nt|dburn: by the look of things|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@d = relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if DBL by Fred would absolutely deny 4@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|passell: this may actually make |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he can't really risk hearing @D from partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually looking again,  it just might make|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|harmon: another 6c hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@s = at least 55 in @h and @c|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT = relay|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you proceed?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rhelle: 3@s = eaxctly 3=5=0=3|pg||
nt|passell: will take careful defense|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|007 joosth: a hard job to do|pg||
nt|wstuart: Let me type tihs more accurately**So, I think their NT in 3rd seat white is 12-14 (15-17 vul 3rd only).|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@D was GF checkback, I assume.|pg||
nt|chorush: Specs are asking why Stansby would upgrade his hand. the reason is the good 5 card suit mostly|pg||
nt|wstuart: The very fine controls are another reason.|pg||
nt|wstuart: I more true method than the A=4, K=3, Q=2, etc evaluation is to count Aces as 4.5, kings as 3 and Q and J as a little less than the Goren HCP representatoin.|pg||
nt|chorush: There is no obvious eighth trick here much less a ninth, so Meckwell did well to make 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: claim -- let opponents figure it out|pg||
nt|ritong: the @c stack is hidden|pg||
nt|ritong: and south did not lead his singleton|pg||
nt|passell: yes club lead down for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: however, north might switch to a @c in order to open trick(s) before @ds are good|pg||
nt|passell: looks like a trick short|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: lacks a tempo|pg||
nt|sybarra: but a tap in the long trump hand  kills it doesnt it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 53  Nickell 13-0 for the set  now leads Fleisher by 20|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rhelle: 3NT is to play|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe 6NT now?|pg||
nt|harmon: =h-5|pg||
nt|passell: then they have to be careful to play a trump next|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|nt|yuval10: time to stop now|pg||
nt|algraves: hello|pg||
nt|brolucius: That lead would have paid off if East held a singleton club.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 17 opposite 16+ ... he won't stop under slam|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c = 4 controls, 15+|pg||
nt|rhelle: (A=2 controls, K=1)|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: NS convention card from 2010 European Championship is online -- but it won't give you the details Rob is providing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|rhelle: 4@h shows a @h picture - can't have 3, he would have supported them earlier|pg||
nt|sybarra: now (single dummy) what do you do next with Fred's hand?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ritong: pump trumps while keeping a policeman|pg||
nt|passell: down 1 unless heart now|pg||
nt|ritong: that s what he did|pg||
nt|ritong: and de wijs is smelling a trap|pg||
nt|passell: tied up again with 1 down|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW convention card from 2010 Trials   http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblcards/GrecoHampson.jpg|pg||
pc|s8|nt|wstuart: Aces and Kings gain power the more distributional the contract hands are, and aces and Kings combined with a 5 card suit for NT is a very big plus.|pg||
nt|rhelle: At first glance this looks as 1 of 2 finesses. 5@c tricks, 2@d, 1@h, 2@s = 10. An extra trick can be developed in @h or @s|pg||
nt|rhelle: so finding trick 12 is what it's all about - before giving away 2|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|chorush: well, that got him up to 8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzfe: had @H2 out but put it back|pg||
nt|passell: unreal|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is type of hand that shows weakness of double dummy software -- much more interesting when defense can't see the cards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wstuart: Specs ask if a 1NT rebid could conceal 1 or 2 4 card majors the way Martel-Stansby are playing, and I believe the answer is yes, they tend to rebid 1NT to show the Strong NT when ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: possible.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rhelle: this trick will not be what South was waiting for|pg||
nt|rhelle: Chances are that the @sQ is with West now - he can see 6@h and 2@c in East already|pg||
nt|harmon: needs more than that|pg||
nt|rhelle: So he needs a double squeeze - @s@d against West, @h@d against East. But he has no @d entry ...|pg||
nt|rhelle: Not enough entries to ruff the @ds high either|pg||
nt|rhelle: Looks like he'll need the double @s finesse against West|pg||

nt|hedyg: Liz is catching up|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry we lost our connection|pg||
nt|passell: hard to imagine a layout that a trump back wasnt best |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: of course when she got disconnected the players went on|pg||
nt|ritong: painful hand for the orange guys|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: time to get one or two solid shots for israeli pair|pg||
nt|chorush: These two teams have a lot of history in the past 2 years, mostly in the US Team Trials|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: hi yuv hi all|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|passell: moss gittleman are awesome with the momentum there way|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, brad adores to keep pressure on opps|pg||
nt|ritong: which explains a lot of his creations|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Losing the connection is hardly your fault, Liz, unless you were unlucky where you spilt your coffee.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: last set we saw EW use  jumps to show mixed raise|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean, we all like to keep their heads under the water, of course|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: salut Henri|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann makes a fist to show that 2@H is strong.  gitelman gently passes|pg||
nt|wstuart: Not looking good for 4@S here, though it is a fine contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: if Lew finesses he can make, but I doubt he will do that.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Maybe however.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Interesting choice here at T1|pg||
nt|wstuart: Nvm|pg||
nt|chorush: he is going to make 11 tricks whether he finesses or not, in my opinion|pg||
nt|wstuart: @H lead gives it away|pg||
nt|wstuart: I was looking at the play before I saw the @H lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: but brad has a particular talent for that|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|dburn: question of whether this goes down quickly or slowly, I guess|pg||
nt|chorush: Only way to have beaten this contract is with a club lead and a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: 2NT artif prolly any gf hand with no suitable rebid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of gazzilli, just upscaled|pg||
nt|bg: letssee|pg||
nt|ritong: you think he should act?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: just the manner, softly placing the card on the tray|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar: not the worst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: then asks who wants water; moss accepts|pg||
nt|rhelle: NS play reverse count and attitude - so the 4 is from an even number|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|dburn: a club lead would mean quickly, this means slowly - assuming the defense does nothing silly|pg||
nt|wstuart: Doesn't 3 rds of @C beat it too, Ira?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: so far eldad has shown a strong 2 in @hs with questionable suit quality|pg||
nt|yuval10: double-dummy 6@h looks quite fair, but not today|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT is a kind of puppet, asking opener to come back to his opening suit|pg||
nt|ritong: unless ha has real good news|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|harmon: be nice to tavel tod but that has dangers|pg||
nt|harmon: we know its safe but......|pg||
nt|harmon: travel to a diamond|pg||
nt|harmon: I type like doo doo|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Jacki: did you use our payment screens?  b/c your deposit didn't go through.  The error message usually means a wrong card type (it's a drop down menu) or a wrong CVV number|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|nt|ritong: they did not want to try the coup three in a row  remained possible, though|pg||
nt|ritong: in this context, 3@c instead of 2NT would be forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: here, pachtmann had relatively good news|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman seems always in control, never on tilt, never in a hurry|pg||
nt|ritong: moss cares about the excited part|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chorush: Eventually, declarer will lead a diamond toward the dummy and on the showout, will take 3 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|nt|ritong: with talent|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: he ruffed the queen? really?|pg||
nt|harmon: 6c hand was played from otherside and got a spade into the KJ made it easier I think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wstuart: but still would lsoe 2@C, 1D and 1S?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|rhelle: that made it cold|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s7|pc|h2|nt|ritong: so, north had relatively good news, but not enough to make a move|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman gesturing like he's counting something out|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chorush: no diamond will be lost; delarer will pitch his two losing diamonds on the AK of hearts|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|nt|bg: these club discards are risky if W swithches now it is not safe to set up hearts|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|wstuart: ah, of course.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: speaking of good front runners   Nickell now 20-0 for the set  leads Fleisher by 27|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: i bet brad will try some joke about that at the table  he s facetious|pg||

nt|ahollan1: one window per table|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Liz is going to have a tough time if they play and claim so quickly|pg||
nt|chorush: Very friendly diamond layout for this slam, presuming it is reached|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know their methods assuming there are methods for hands like these|pg||
mb|1C|nt|wstuart: True, though it doesn't really require a friendly layout to make.|pg||
nt|Jacki: Live streaming available here:   www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  If anyone knows the names of the players at the table, share with us|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: this one looks routine|pg||
nt|ritong: other room EW got offboard due to the systemic 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ritong: showing the equivalent of a very good weak 2 in @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: if you wonder how they treat very strong hands, big @c is the answer|pg||
nt|ritong: any 16+ hand is opened 1@c|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a school of thought that one shouldn't Michaels with a 6 card Maj, however, I don't know if much analysis has been done on 7-5 bidding.  :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  looks liek Robert Levin|pg||
nt|sybarra: open a browser for each room you want to see|pg||
nt|ritong: moss will probably bid 4@s directly|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The East hand is worth an extra point, with those controls and the five-card spades.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the convention card that I am looking at, 2NT shows only 20-21. That's puzzling.|pg||
nt|dburn: Cheek may well lead a heart, which will work rather well for him|pg||
nt|hedyg: except the @s suit is not nice and stiff AK not great for NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he downgraded?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Top players rarely downgrade.|pg||
nt|ritong: after the raise, that is|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Mind you, they don't miscount very often either.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have 20-21(22) may have a 5 card major|pg||
nt|wstuart: As you can see from the 3@S bid - Martel is a very aggressive player, which is why I was surprised when he downgraded a control righ 15 HCP to a 12-14 NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  and can't miss Meckstroth....|pg||
nt|robbg:  Weinstein (r) meck (l) with backs to us|pg||
nt|chorush: I would think Katz would close the bidding with 6 hearts here, unless he thinks he has a good way to get to 7 if it is there|pg||
nt|robbg:  Levin facing|pg||
nt|rhelle: systematically, NS have to open 1@h with 55 majors|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: a diamond wn't work so well|pg||
nt|algraves: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@d is 18-19(20)|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, it may not work at all|pg||
nt|dburn: though declarer will still have to guess the play extremely well|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@S is a control bid in @S showing a good hand and making a slam try in @Hs.|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4NT is likely RKC|pg||
nt|wstuart: Katz will likely jump showing the number of keycards and a void.|pg||
nt|chorush: They will have a way to show a void but Katz cannot be sure the void is not opposite an ace, as it happens to be here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jillan:  3 aces and a spade void|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy bid   |pg||
nt|ritong: experts hate leads from xxx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yuval10: 9 easy tricks from top|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is visibly sitting on the benefits|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry, got knocked off the internet but didn't miss any of the bridge|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard promises 4 @s and opener|pg||
nt|ritong: i think they can raise on 3 now and then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H2 is ATTITUDE|pg||
pc|h3|nt|algraves: seems normal|pg||
nt|wstuart: (RKC = Roman Keycard Blackwood) where there are 5 controls -  the 4 aces and the trump K.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "that's too fast", takes time to study dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: just trying to avoid big swings|pg||
nt|ritong: if he was not doing that, he would certainly raise @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss wrote: if you bid 1NT, X would be takeout. haven't discussed here|pg||
nt|ritong: which were freely bid by his pard|pg||
nt|hedyg: so now he knows no @D in N|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|harmon: 4d could be beaten2 so this is better|pg||
nt|rhelle: it bites them here ... 4@h or 4@s looks solid|pg||
nt|harmon: they play canape??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i played those a lot in the 70s/80s  and to be honest  i have no idea how/why they work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh  soo sorry vs suit 3rd/5th|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: a @c now and...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: why @c rather than @H?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: oy|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rhelle: no, just to keep the relays symmetrical - it's an exception|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bg: some may try to run club 8 now but not at imps risk of losing 4 dia tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he probably knew that anyway - he would not expect Cheek to lead from @dAQ108 only against 2NT - all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how so you say that in French Henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: oy²|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice H @H|pg||
nt|passell: great lead ace and a diamond for sure he would go down|pg||
nt|ritong: he s not home and dry, but indeed would have been tougher|pg||
nt|passell: may still make on a dbl squeeze  but great guessing involved|pg||
nt|passell: he will probably play to ruff in queen of diamonds  then guess the end position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other than  it works   was there any reason Muller could find @C shift|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t think moss can afford to check if @h was an underlead or not|pg||
nt|ritong: so many winning other solutions|pg||
nt|passell: club shift would be bad he would be forced to guess the dia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room the opening lead was @D    then @C10 shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: but is club shift, with 106xx |pg||
nt|sybarra: you just dont have a club spot in the S hand|pg||
nt|passell: maybe he will guess it anyway since a low dia wasnt shifted to  he might have without the queen|pg||
nt|passell: a truly great hand of cat and mouse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cool inference Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree MIke,  can be making, -1, making, +1 etc |pg||
nt|sybarra: ok +1 optimistic|pg||
nt|ritong: somehow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike previous board which was different set of animals|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|harmon: oh ok|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|wstuart: They claim should come right after Katz tries to sneak a @C through.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jillan:  NIckell again please|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bg: if N doesnt keep his two spades E could make 4 on an andplay|pg||
nt|ritong: now the real tough part|pg||
nt|ritong: will take ages, prepare sandwiches|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: better be fast sandwiches?|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: there are a lot of informations/inferences to gather up|pg||
nt|ritong: for starters, why did the guy underlead?|pg||
nt|ritong: has he really underled?|pg||
nt|ritong: why the @d A first?|pg||
nt|ritong: why not a @c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: next is can you afford to duck @D?|pg||
nt|ritong: etc|pg||
nt|sybarra: etc etc|pg||
nt|sybarra: this makes my head hurt |pg||
nt|sybarra: and I am not even at the table|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about some port and stilton?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he asked about the diamond 7 earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brad had time to relax while defense struggled with previous board -- he's just wearing them down now|pg||
nt|ritong: also, in general, players tend to delay crucial moves|pg||
nt|ritong: here, if brad hops @d K, from his point of view he s not dead already when @d Q does not drop|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|ritong: after a ruff|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||

nt|yuval10: this wasn't a good day for Louisville in the NCAA tournement - the local college, led by coach Pitino, surprisingly lost to 14th seeded Morehead st. 62:61|pg||

nt|passell: well guessed when he ruffed the diamond north was squeezed|pg||
mb|3S|nt|007 joosth: what about the 1NT rebid?|pg||
nt|chorush: Most players will not rebid a 5 card minor nor reverse with such skimpy values, so 1NT is chosen as the alternative|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2 amazing hands in a row for declarer |pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: when they restarted Geoff shda passed:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: a nightmare to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Was 3@D available?|pg||
nt|dburn: better not bid any more, or he may have a doubled nightmare to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet    2@C transfer to @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: it was alerted but no one gave any info|pg||
pc|cA|nt|algraves: will Lauria double if Cheek bids again?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 2@s showed 6-5...|pg||
nt|ritong: this might get bloody|pg||
nt|passell: escaped the ouble  fred knows he is doing well  not chancing an accident|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rhelle: EW in trouble now|pg||
nt|ritong: at 50 a piece, though|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chorush: 50 years ago it would  have been universal to open East's hand 1 heart and rebid 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|algraves: no could have been only 4 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't agree that it should show 5-6 (on the basis that North has denied four spades). That is a reasonable auction to describe a strong 4-6 hand. |pg||
nt|sybarra: N  has the hands my pards usually have :(|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: this contract has a lot of play|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h looks makeable, so Schwartz team likely gets some imps back|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman studying the trick before turning it|pg||
nt|ritong: trump looks clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: then why bid 3@H?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: no trumps etc|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: 7|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz' 3H bid here is announcing some black suit worry|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: brad has doubled, and not with a trump stack|pg||
nt|ritong: so he has values, including @h control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann lowers screen, asks about carding, gitelman answers UDCA|pg||
nt|dburn: he doesn't have a bad hand for hearts, or so he hopes - that @sJ would be a working card, and he has an ace|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|wstuart: The question was posed that if EW knew both hands, why would they not bid 6@D (not knowing the NS layout).|pg||
nt|rhelle: lead: either a small trump or the @dK|pg||
nt|harmon: prob d3 uless defense slips|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|algraves: down 2 or 3 it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, 3@d is pretty much bound to be hopeless unless partner miraculously has two of them|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever for Lauria to double, as I see it. |pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: ron tried a small @h to his stiff jack, but unfortunately moss was aware about that card|pg||
nt|jillan:  because it is a poor slam|pg||
nt|chorush: mainly because it is about a 41% contract|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jillan:  it has ONE virtue - it makes|pg||
nt|harmon: need to start spades for 5th trick|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd start with @h ...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: no clear reason to give up on trump attack|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lauria said he miscounted last hand, thought he had 21|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: so do we have a guess re 2 @C?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: Did he really, though, or was that just to annoy N/S?|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally, when opps go down a bunch, the first reaction should be " hey, did we have something to play" instead of " har har har  suckers"|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bg: Fred may regret tossing Dia|pg||
nt|bg: now if S ruffs a dia he cannot get off dummy without E playng another dia but he can discarf a club now Fred doent have anther dia|pg||
nt|ritong: far sighted, bruce|pg||
nt|yuval10: other room has already played twice as many boards as played here|pg||
nt|bg: if he ruffs a club now he has to finesse the dia|pg||
nt|sybarra: trans. to @D?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|wstuart: To expand on my answer from above, the @H finesse is 50% and 3-0 @D is 22%, so the slam will fail 61% of the time (0.5 * 0.22).|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chorush: Commendable bidding from EW will cost them 1 imp|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: well it is what he said|pg||
nt|brolucius: You are at the table-side?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: coincidentally the 2 close matches are from the same bracket   one SemiFinal will be winner of Diamond-Berg  vs winner of Nickell-Fleisher|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bg: now everything sb ok|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that this move does not cost a trick, contrarily to superficial look|pg||
nt|hedyg: no but Liz is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: low heart might still pick off Tx or Txx with Gitelman|pg||
nt|dburn: looks like a Roland grand slam|pg||
nt|algraves: hmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: system summary for NS: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=577&pid=155|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: unable to record play due to the fact that I got disconnected|pg||
nt|rhelle: very swingy match so far |pg||
mb|1C!|an|17+|mb|p|nt|algraves: Lauria played too quickly there as it was clear to not play a third spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson's 1@C opener was 16+|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ritong: they prolly have a tool to show 5@s 4@h limit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they are joking that it might go all pass at othe table|pg||
nt|dburn: but 6@s is pretty good - not straightforward to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks good for a splinter bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: result is accurate|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|wstuart: Since the IMP returns are +11 IMPs for 920 vs 420 and -10 IMPs for -50 vs -400, the slam needs to be an 11:21 favorite in order to break even, wihch is 52%|pg||
nt|ritong: by the way, 3NT was hard to defeat on previous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11  game force|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|bg: yes 2h =5spades 4 hearts|pg||
nt|chorush: That's true, Wayne, when you compare it with 5 of a minor but not when 3NT is an alternative|pg||
nt|harmon: sometimes opening light gets you, this was one of em|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry BAL 9-11|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|yuval10: West in the OR chose 1NT after South decided to open 1@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well my copy of convention card also says 1@C=16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: possible 11 tricks  let s see|pg||
nt|marinesa: many pairs play 2h is 5s,4h 0-9 and 2s is 5s,4h and 10-11 something in this range|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rhelle: looks like 1 off, another 11 IMP swing|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe -2, actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if they've increased min for 1@C, maybe they've reduced min for 2@D|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|marinesa: especially precision pairs|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D shows a mixed raise.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: on the previous hand that is|pg||
nt|algraves: a lot of work to do in slam , KX spades is very favourable of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: a joke it is for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: any shortness, 3@H ask and 3@S= singleton @C|pg||
nt|dburn: to say nothing of 4-3 diamonds with the king right, and the heart finesse on should North lead the suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that this method appears on their card.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 6@c demands several good news|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ritong: but..|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: the @h 9 had for purpose to diagnose if south has a stiff honor|pg||
nt|ritong: noone would cover with Hx(x)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if 3@S was shortness   North hand has gotten much worse|pg||
nt|ritong: of course i am not aware about tarzan's subtleties|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: very true, Ira|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: however, it seems that 3@h should come from Hx rather than xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we had a system expert doing commentary last set - but it is very late where he is now  [poland]|pg||
nt|ritong: just my (uninformed) two cents|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: why tarzan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H could also have been just shape showing|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|ritong: weiss/muller|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|yuval10: bye|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is not the only facetious one around this table, seems|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well bid, anyway. They are over the first hurdle of a two-hurdle-race.|pg||
nt|algraves: so all reasonable lines of play will work it seems|pg||
nt|robbg:  anyway that is backwards, if those were the only 2 possible results the needed odds would be 10/21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@C a relay rather than showing @C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: 3@D= fit and a singleton. 3@H asking etc|pg||
nt|sybarra: weiss/muller, sounds like wiesmuiler who played tarzar in 1930's (also champion swimmer)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 58  Nickell over Fleisher by a mere 4 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell original  2 seed    Fleisher  7|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, we had few opportunities to observe it, but muller is a rreal tough guy, especially in the opening lead compartiment|pg||
nt|sybarra: Johnny Weissmuller....correct spelling |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond  3 seed and Berg has risen from  22|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: fred asked about 3H and brad asked about 3D but I didn't get conclusive answers|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: a limited hand, no more than 4-5 controls|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is reassuring when he takes so long to work out the best plan. Makes you want to give up the game when they pick up 12 tricks without pausing for breath.|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not easy|pg||
nt|algraves: lol, very complicated if you are trying to make with spades 3-1 as you would like to ruff 3 clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: he may start @cA, club ruff, @dQ intending to pitch a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: or, I suppose, he may just take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: don't see any other serious runners, but far from clear which of those two is favourite|pg||
nt|harmon: I think he needs the ht finesse, but I let better analysts decide|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he may be thinking of heart finesse and then if that works to finesse club with fall back on 2-2 spades with king on side|pg||
nt|brolucius: East did choose the splinter bid art the other table and, as you see, they have netted 1430 at the other table. If you put your cursor over the result, you can see the auction.|pg||
nt|algraves: first really big hand of the match as slam may not be bid in other room|pg||
nt|algraves: oh i see|pg||
nt|algraves: that is a great feature|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump lead made it a bit easier.|pg||
nt|harmon: Fleischer leading Nickell 20-0 after 6|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzfe: and did not see what went under SK|pg||
nt|chorush: that's true, and not known by most players|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|harmon: Hey if Alfredo agrees with me I cant be tooo wrong|pg||
nt|brolucius: He didn't agree with you very quickly...|pg||
nt|harmon: as long as he did lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: We will see if he agrees with Allan by finessing in clubs next!|pg||
nt|rhelle: defence needs to be careful not to be thrown in|pg||
pc|s2|nt|algraves: lol, easy when you see all the cards|pg||
nt|harmon: Q of d my prediction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: you probably know him as Olympic Swimmer|pg||
nt|ritong: ya sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: tarzan is just a comics hero:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he played Tarzan in movies |pg||
nt|sybarra: (black and white movies btw)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  Weissmuller did win a number of gold medals before becoming hollywood's tarzan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in case we forgot --- nice stop in 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell lead no just 2    5 boards to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: that may come now|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders will be muttering to themselves under their breath. 'How many finesses is this guy going to take?!'|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s lead in OR|pg||
nt|harmon: ok Q of d now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ruff a @c first|pg||
nt|brolucius: The famous English player, Jeremy Flint, used to advise that you commit a huge amount of energy to the important boards. Operation Big Deal. That is exactly what Versace is doing.|pg||
nt|dburn: ace of hearts also not impossible, just to see whether he needs a heart pitch at all, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that's probably too risky if the king doesn't drop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss'  @S2  upside down count|pg||

nt|ritong: but two keys off|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|brolucius: Versace was exhausted after the previous board and bid 3@S so that his partner could take a fair share of the work.|pg||
nt|dburn: third slam in a row|pg||
nt|ritong: he found a way to overcome 4/2@h break and, naturally, they were 3/3|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: this one rather better than the last|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: another 'quiet' board - we're being spoilt tonight!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mslair: likely another 13 IMPs to the Diamond team|pg||
nt|ritong: unclear|pg||
nt|ritong: brad might make it short|pg||
nt|chorush: We will see the effect of the weak NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: short by opening 4 hearts|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@d asks for a @d stop for 3NT|pg||
nt|harmon: 6h makes 6d goes down on roght lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: great EW result here|pg||
nt|harmon: yes|pg||
nt|rhelle: and 7@c is a cheap save, of course - 3 off|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: or try some joke|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman showed interest when the tray came back.  usually is very stoic|pg||
nt|ritong: good time to have a gadget for minors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another slam - just when I have to head for my wine-tasting. Ah well, it was 75 minutes very enjoyably spent. Bye!|pg||
nt|chorush: One of the disadvantages is that is allows the opponents to overcall freely at the one level. A major advantage is that it hinders the opponents from their natural bidding when ...|pg||
nt|chorush: they have the weak NT opener|pg||
nt|rhelle: as 1@d is artificial, 4@d must be pass or correct|pg||
nt|rhelle: North is looking for a save,|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: 2 clubs has not been alerted, but I believe it is a transfer to 2D which is a cue bid raise with 3 trumps|pg||
nt|rhelle: and will be surprised his partner's suit is @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 comparisons left|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N very anti-systemic according to my copy of their CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: NS have 7 losers hope they do not vul get them into unprofitable sac|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|dburn: and seven making on a fluke if you accidentally bid it|pg||
nt|chorush: Martel must now have a way to show his strong NT|pg||
nt|harmon: he knows his suit is clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: north wrote to east that he "thought 3d showed diamonds but not 100% sure"|pg||
nt|harmon: pard asked for d stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Most experts play that 2 spades is Nickells weakest action|pg||
nt|rhelle: does he? Partner can't have @ds after the precision 1@d opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: at least that is what the note said|pg||
nt|harmon: oh ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: not sure how east kept a straight face during that explanation|pg||
nt|rhelle: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: that's the auction|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: fred: really?"|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, he knows now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: right|pg||
nt|harmon: Eric might might just bid 6h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chorush: Pass would be stronger|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: 2NT forcing, no doubt a useful treatment, but Versace is a bit cramped for room now|pg||
nt|rhelle: 5NT = pick a slam, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i scrambled thinking 1st seat favorable MIGHT be 9-12 but nope|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lauria has shown 16+ with 5+@d 4@H and no 3@ss|pg||
nt|rhelle: asking partner to choose between 6@d and 6@h|pg||
nt|rhelle: great bid|pg||
pc|d9|nt|algraves: pick a slam sort of bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT probably denies 6 @ds now|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes 5NT= pick a slam|pg||
nt|rhelle: and a great save|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: pachtmann lost a big chance imho|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h will sound bizarre to fred's ear|pg||
nt|ritong: if any:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzfe: fred writes: not discussed. 2245|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, fred is super happy|pg||
nt|ritong: he had the right tool for a hand which is usually very tough to negotiate|pg||
nt|mslair: can't sign off in 5 hearts   I think he will bid 6 hearts  |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss bouncing nervously|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: @s Q10 is awkward|pg||
nt|chorush: With great good fortune this is going to make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: just bid 4@s and check what happened after smoke clears up|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss also writes 2245|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss: he doesn't know anything about my hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzfe: north says "i guess 3d asked for stopper"|pg||

pc|dA|nt|dburn: 6@c "you pick one", 6@d "all right", 6NT "not that one"|pg||
nt|algraves: well bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz' double was a very good tactic; he really wanted the opps out of 3NT looking at his club holding|pg||
nt|jillan:  well done!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|algraves: well he was probably no 0454 as no 3@C so 6@C 1453|pg||
nt|harmon: 6n wrong sided but safe|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 3 cards in @D Versace would probably have bid 4@d|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|chorush: Nickell will shift to the heart king and Katz will have nothing to lose by overtaking it|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: loud discussion from hall, kibitzer gail greenberg hurries to close door|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he claimed 7 on a squeeze but ns objected|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director has been nagging the players about being slow now he says|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they might not be able to play all the boards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chorush: So Katz' double transformed a loss to a gain. Hard to blame Stansby for thinking that 3NT wasn't going to make|pg||
nt|rhelle: another testing board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|harmon: they were right too|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  how to stay out of game here|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 boards played, 45-45. Incredible match|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dburn: were they? wasn't North going to be show-up-squeezed in hearts and clubs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sry i always try to say when declarer claims t1 because people ask why I didn't type in the cards that went by|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually other room only on 59   but other match at least 4 boards faster|pg||
nt|ritong: muller has to move|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: mrs greenberg is brad's mom|pg||
nt|algraves: so cheek and gure play negative doubles after 2NT unusual|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: south said he was able to pitch|pg||
nt|chorush: A double by Katz here might have turned what will be a minus into a plus|pg||
nt|jillan:  yes a double from Katz wold have made it a bit simpled for Nickell|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 2@s hoping pard can bid NTs|pg||
mb|d|nt|harmon: grue coulda pitched his q of d|pg||
nt|dburn: he was right about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting DBL|pg||
mb|r|nt|harmon: no diff|pg||
nt|wstuart: Surely Nick will bid here, prob 5@C rather than 4NT.|pg||
nt|chorush: Mind you Katz has a terrible hand but he does have what he knows are a wasted AK of hearts|pg||
nt|wstuart: wrong again.|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: grue needed Q10 of d|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|chorush: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|wstuart: Tough decision between 5@C and 4NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: that will be 11 tricks and 3 IMPs - bringing the match exactly level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: hmmm|pg||
nt|jillan:  don't think Nickell tought pass was NF|pg||
nt|ritong: oh|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: makeable|pg||
nt|ritong: auction is crystal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: create doubt -- might help explain how Diamond team won the World Championships in Philly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rosenblum Cup|pg||
nt|ritong: this looks like a deciding board|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: guess @ds and bye bye clara|pg||
nt|bg: personally I am not a fan of not bidding out shape the 3 club bid could be an artificial force in some structures I would bid 4 clubs over 3 spades and show the shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought @CK to @D finesse was mirage|pg||
nt|ritong: a decision, al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems extra chances if low @D from hand|pg||
nt|ritong: the guess is: who has @d Hx|pg||
nt|ritong: when south can have @d HHx, i agree small to ten is better|pg||
nt|dburn: might have been easier in hearts, this|pg||
nt|jillan:  this will cost....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: pass over 1@s is three @ss and mini values|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|chorush: will be down 2 since Martel won't get th diamond lead he was hoping for|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult to diagnose what went through their minds, but the difference between the two auctions is brad's surprising double|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzfe: east says he forgot pass was forcing|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: now of course, if north ducks smoothly..|pg||
nt|ritong: redouble is " please look closer"|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: and pass over 2@h is " no, really sorry mate"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: brad sees dummy, calls director, suggests ginossar has broken tempo over 2@S|pg||
nt|ritong: my perso style would be a fitjump in 2@s after pass|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: showing 5@s 4@d inviting values|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: none of these players will pass immediately with no problem as some others do|pg||
nt|dburn: in spades, declarer will have to pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: and he may not have the entries to do it, once he finds that East has four|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: after @SA lead @Dx seems even clearer -- then @DA and if suit not running, hope for 5@C 1@D 2@H 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if North wins @D -- well you're no worse off|pg||
nt|bg: only hopr her is a low dia play N for doubleton honor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: retraction -- just noticed @C discard from trick 1|pg||
nt|dburn: GIB would make it, of course, but although Cheek is a terrific player, he doesn't make everything that GIB would|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: gitelmoss certainly reserv that to an other handtype|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar seemed upset by the director call, takes some time to compose himself|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: he had to decide early|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that should have been @D|pg||
nt|algraves: the downside to 2 suited interference is the distributional information it gives away|pg||
nt|dburn: Cheek may have been uncertain as to whether 4@h was an offer to play, or a control-bid for spades|pg||
nt|dburn: if he'd known it was the former, he'd almost certainly have passed it|pg||
nt|ritong: up to you to draw your own conclusions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's it -- he gave them a chance to go wrong - and they accepted|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|harmon: play ht now|pg||
nt|harmon: needs hts 2-2|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: if he loses a heart to West and a fourth round of diamonds is played...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but actually NS right in a sense    they needed a swing and 3N wasn't going to get one|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jillan:  ahh, ok, THAT explains it|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: he will learn|pg||
nt|harmon: HE NEEDED the heart hook of he couldnt make it|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, I guess he can handle that, but if one isn't played, he can't pick the spades up|pg||
nt|harmon: or|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and line of play  possibly intentionally different in hopes of swing|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: smells like a push|pg||
nt|algraves: nice defense of course|pg||
nt|dburn: he might, though, have decided not to finesse hearts - he could make by finessing clubs instead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: stay stoic|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: need Michael Rosenberg or Bart Bramley for the single-dummy analysis|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: for that matter, if someone has to get upset, it is rather pachtmann|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|algraves: interesting after the thrid @D , |pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|nt|ritong: ...|pg||

nt|dburn: still, declarer should probably have made it given the bidding|pg||
nt|wstuart: Nip and tuck, Fleisher back on top now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rhelle: and another interesting hand ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1@s = relay|pg||
mb|1N|an|f1r|nt|algraves: how does he make after the ruff sluff?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: with 3 to score   O'Rourke leads Nickell by 7|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think DBL showed a 5+ card minor + 4 card major?|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, I assume 2 diamonds asks for pass or correction to major|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: 1@H or 1@s?|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = 4+ @s|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@c = relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: It's interesting that Martel didn't jam with 3@H here - I guess he thought he had enough defense with both majors that he wasn't worried about getting outbid.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rhelle: 3@h = 4=6=2=1 exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 3@h now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought previous set 1N was Semi-Force     maybe Semi over 1@H and absolute over 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: can t be 4, since 2@d denied 4@h imo|pg||
mb|3H|nt|harmon: he cant unless ht onside that was my point|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: I try to get the info the write down on notepads and pass around but sometimes no one asks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they|pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North has choices ... 3@s = strong relay, only asks controls|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c = weak relay, asks for max and controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: before everyone yelled at mne lol|pg||
nt|chorush: Not that often that 2NT is right as "save" over 2 spades; here it is going to make when 2 spades also would have made (I think)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@d = signoff, asks partner to bid 4@h, so that he can pass or bid the final contract|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: lets see if fred can save 1 imp making 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss trying to find an escort to leave the room and ginossar tells him just to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some back and forth between boards about the alleged tempo break|pg||
nt|wstuart: is it better for katz to dbl again?|pg||
nt|rhelle: and 4@s = a slight invitation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: Asked by a spec;  I think His DBL of 2@S is probably more strongly penalty oriented.|pg||
nt|chorush: Depends on what their methods are. They might as well not play 2 spades dbld because I don't think they will beat it. Could be wrong though|pg||

nt|ritong: his hand is limited|pg||

nt|ahollan1: curious that Moss opens playing 2/1  and Verhees did NOT playing a Big Club system|pg||
nt|dburn: then, he has the ace and jack of spades, and the lead is in dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP  (3)4+@D|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rhelle: 1@s = 9+, 4+@h, unbalanced|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: NS play precision so 1@D can be many kinds of hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: very nice slam - hard to bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for specs unfamiliar with the treatment    2N showed Balanced Game Force   a totally new concept that was introduced in 1920s|pg||
nt|bg: this pair obviously use 2nt as a balanced openig bid vs others who use Jacoby--both styles have their merits|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: that sounds right according to their pre alert|pg||

mb|5D|nt|ritong: not sure about their style, but this @c Ax is surely worth an effort|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C must deny 3+@S|pg||
nt|wstuart: Spec asks what is the diff between the 2@S cue and a potential 2@C cue.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h = 2=2=5=4 exactly, 6-8 points|pg||
nt|passell: moss may raise 5dia though|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: hard not to|pg||
mb|6D|nt|wstuart: Many play that the higher cue is more trumps and less HCP then the lower cue.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h also promises at least 1 control, so North will be wondering what to do next. 6@d looks possible|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: just not sure if 6th @C shown|pg||
nt|chorush: different pairs have different uses. Could be 2 spades shows 4 card support and 2C shows 3. Each to his own|pg||
nt|passell: needs 2 3-2 breaks and a lot more|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: i think double dummy defense can set this 4    starts with @H lead|pg||
nt|ritong: now a battle of undertricks|pg||
nt|ritong: three looks like a lot of them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then they must untangle @S winners while retaining transportation in @H -- extremely unlikely|pg||
nt|bg: rebid of the minor usually shows 6 with 3 hearts better to raise hearts with unbalanced hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: right Bruce -- but there is slight impact playing transfer responses|pg||
nt|ritong: try @c hook, loses, a @h back|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 11 3@H -2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: now the contract makes with @d K on|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: depending on 1N rebid -- 1@H can be used to show exactly 3@H [1N=weak balanced hand] or 2/3@H  [1N=18-19]|pg||
nt|harmon: Hedy why u disconnect tables??|pg||
nt|ritong: offer him an entry!|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: last board.  thanks all for watching.  quarterfinals start tomorrow at 1pm EDT|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play variable 14-16 and 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Jan must have reconnected|pg||
nt|algraves: they play more like 13 to bad 16|pg||
nt|wstuart: An interesting consideration on these 3NT rebids is what opener's holding in responder's suit is - it's reasonable to define it as with showing 1 or less or 2 or more.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: There are many slam hands where that is the crucial and hard to determine peice of information if you don't ahve a specific agreemnt.|pg||
nt|rhelle: very hard to see ... you see, even at this level they slip up in defence|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: but teams can agree to start earlier|pg||
nt|ritong: an other difficult decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok we have the scores now, great!|pg||
nt|algraves: versace right on the rule of 2 or 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 tricks, no outside defense, classic|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: when raised, what to do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 1pm EDT = 5pm GMT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S easy  -- Moss 4@S probably easy too  since @Dxx|pg||
mb|2D|an|9-11 3 card|nt|rhelle: 1@d = 11-15, 3+@d, unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is a real chance for Fleisher|pg||
nt|dburn: five diamonds (even six diamonds) look vastly preferable to 3NT|pg||
nt|wstuart: Prob 2NT showing the str NT?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: enterprising 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Open Room  Greco thought a long time before passing 3@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: short break and then 2nd segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if in 4@S, i think declarer has a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: take the plus|pg||
nt|algraves: and lauria adds his three tricks and there you have it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wot hapen there?|pg||
nt|wstuart: but Chip will likely just kick it in to 3NT knowing he is facing at least some @H wastage for a slam.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could bid 3@h, just to make sure|pg||
nt|wstuart: true, they still have chances here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: good match, shakes hands with opps.  fred: good play cashing @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: thsi must imply a @D fit.|pg||
nt|ritong: no tilt|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chorush: Stanby probably will bid 3S|pg||
nt|ritong: muller is a great player|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and quick refresh now shows Grue [original 21] beat Cayne [ 4]     Fleisher [7] over Nickell [2]|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: i mentioned because South hand opposite a 14-16 NT improved during the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: well done Chip - knew you wouldn't let me down|pg||
nt|wstuart: I assume 3@C after 2NT would not have been forcing.|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know enuf about their methods|pg||
nt|wstuart: Although, after a 2 level nerg DBL opposite a str NT it seems like it should be.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h looks like a make - especially with the @d Ace before the king|pg||
nt|rhelle: a game on pretty minimal values|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if EW negotiate @C ruff beat is easy|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the other room North opened 1NT - for reasons he better understand than I|pg||
nt|rhelle: and they made slam tried, all the way to 5@h :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: this was a very exciting set, been a long time since I saw so many swings|pg||
nt|rhelle: at this level, that is - my Monday night game produces them as well :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz is going to have a good idea what to lead if it plays here|pg||
nt|wstuart: Chip's sequence expresses doubt about 3NT and Lew's stopper is surely about as weak as they come.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - he cant pass, can he?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|algraves: now diamond and diamond will eventually beat it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: but in real world ...|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he can't|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfe: my computer is having some problem|pg||
nt|algraves: now Versace will have to guess TX in trumps to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: just a little bit more Liz! |pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: so we will be back about 15 minutes after all finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry lag not responding|pg||
nt|algraves: pershaps south did overtake and it was missed by recorder|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he just misguessed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I tried to key it|pg||
nt|algraves: thrid diamond, and if neccessary 4th diamond promotes trump ten|pg||
nt|hedyg: np Liz, you didnt a good job! thanks @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: you did a good job* my keyboard too!|pg||
nt|algraves: even if south did not overtake it seems natural for West to misguess the third diamond after south wins trump ace|pg||
nt|sillafu: how can he misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: Liz it is minus 1 for sure?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the result of -1 confirmed|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now they need to not overstate their values.|pg||
nt|wstuart: VWD for Martel-Stansby!|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a reason they have won so many championships.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chorush: looks like this one can't be beaten|pg||
