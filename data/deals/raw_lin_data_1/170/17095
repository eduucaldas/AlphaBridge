nt|brolucius: @HK-x. Declarer ruffed the next round high from A-K-Q-x and Zia's J-x-x in trumps was promoted. Brilliant!|pg||

nt|rhelle: hello everyone|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yuval10: 5NT is interesting, of course in standart bridge it means to pick between 6 or 7, but it doesn't seem likely considering West' strength|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess North might bid 4NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: West leaps to 4@S rather than tip his hand with a cue-bid response. Interesting. He makes life more difficult for N/S that way.|pg||
nt|dburn: intending to convert clubs to diamonds to show 6-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: with 5-5, he would bid diamonds at once|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann exhales deeply. looks tired|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: oh -- missed the note 4N=@H cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: The problem was that both were cue-bidding second round controls |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP  4+@S  maybe 4@S and any 5+ other suit|pg||
mb|2C|an|GF|nt|ahollan1: Verhees doesn't care about a 2nd suit :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but then again ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: with 5@S & 5@H the opening bid would be 1@H -- so vP sequence shows LONGER @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Verhees asks about 3@s and Greco says showed club support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other match is playing different boards, but you can still get dizzy watching the other 3 tables using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@D will probably talk Greco out of leading that suit -- so 5@S will probably make [if vP doesn't get excited by @C void]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: We thought they'd change the lineup here so there would be one slow and one fast at each table, but they didn't (Schwartz had seed this 1/4)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry - didn't mean that to be public, but was discussing the fact that we don't have the close Jacobs-Kang match on because they hadn't compared when this match was ready to start ...|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there's a theory about which when to sit Big Club vs Big Club when you have the seating rights -- i just can't remember the details :(|pg||

mb|1S|nt|chorush: hi Wayne|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: NS in the OR judged very well to bid to the 5 level|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: don't worry - the play is not likely to be too fast for you to keep up with from now on|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: We are all indebted to BBO for letting us watch these top tournaments free of charge. I hope they don't change their mind one day...|pg||

mb|3H|nt|hedyg: 1@c= 2+|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will still be free for commentators, Hedy. No need to worry.|pg||
nt|chorush: that dbl has just transformed this hand from something resembling a push to a swing for Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: chip wrote 12-14|pg||
nt|wstuart: He wrote 12-14 on the notepad the operator says.  This is very un-Chip-like.  He's a very aggressive player and I wouldn't expect him to downgrade a controlish 15 HCP, even though ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: it is 4333.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: well at least im here now for the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c looks like a decent contract - not easy to bid though|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ritong: a short fight, finally|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss grimaces a bit, points at dummy, still making plans|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|ritong: shorter than next room, where EW pushed a bit|pg||
nt|chorush: It may only be 3rd 4th position vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: South must've been convinced that his Partner has void @s|pg||
nt|wstuart: At one time they played 12-14 in all seats *except* 3rd, where it was 15-17.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|yuval10: on surface it looks like N's double meant to discourage his Partner of carry on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although if the kibitzers had to pay they would probably be less tolerant of the mistakes that the commentators make.|pg||
nt|dburn: optimistic, that - should South really have both majors stopped and the ace of clubs?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: still, this lead may let him escape for down only one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the result is an impossible 3NT in the wrong hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzfe: some question whether the 84-44 carryover is correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol no Liz|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is E/W bidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't make it with these cards, but maybe has more chance on the actual borad 3|pg||
nt|dburn: no, this is North-South bidding - they're just not bidding board 2 again|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: A@S?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if one of the majors was bare, West might have made an unlucky choice of lead. It was adventurous bidding by N/S that could have worked better.|pg||
nt|dburn: true, and I guess if South had a couple of aces, the unstopped major might well be 4-4 anyway|pg||

mb|1C|nt|chorush: Every conventional use of a bid has some downside. Stayman, probably the most uniformly played convention of all time, had a big downside on this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|wstuart: I'm sure Stansby will upgrade this hand to a 15-17 NT evaluation.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|wstuart: 2@D was GF checkback, I assume.|pg||
nt|chorush: Specs are asking why Stansby would upgrade his hand. the reason is the good 5 card suit mostly|pg||
nt|wstuart: The very fine controls are another reason.|pg||
nt|wstuart: I more true method than the A=4, K=3, Q=2, etc evaluation is to count Aces as 4.5, kings as 3 and Q and J as a little less than the Goren HCP representatoin.|pg||
nt|chorush: There is no obvious eighth trick here much less a ninth, so Meckwell did well to make 2NT|pg||

pc|c6|nt|wstuart: Aces and Kings gain power the more distributional the contract hands are, and aces and Kings combined with a 5 card suit for NT is a very big plus.|pg||
nt|rhelle: At first glance this looks as 1 of 2 finesses. 5@c tricks, 2@d, 1@h, 2@s = 10. An extra trick can be developed in @h or @s|pg||

nt|wstuart: possible.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rhelle: this trick will not be what South was waiting for|pg||
nt|rhelle: Chances are that the @sQ is with West now - he can see 6@h and 2@c in East already|pg||
nt|harmon: needs more than that|pg||
nt|rhelle: So he needs a double squeeze - @s@d against West, @h@d against East. But he has no @d entry ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: of course when she got disconnected the players went on|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: time to get one or two solid shots for israeli pair|pg||
nt|chorush: These two teams have a lot of history in the past 2 years, mostly in the US Team Trials|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: hi yuv hi all|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Losing the connection is hardly your fault, Liz, unless you were unlucky where you spilt your coffee.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|yuval10: salut Henri|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann makes a fist to show that 2@H is strong.  gitelman gently passes|pg||
nt|wstuart: Not looking good for 4@S here, though it is a fine contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: if Lew finesses he can make, but I doubt he will do that.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Maybe however.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Interesting choice here at T1|pg||
nt|wstuart: Nvm|pg||
nt|chorush: he is going to make 11 tricks whether he finesses or not, in my opinion|pg||
nt|wstuart: @H lead gives it away|pg||
nt|wstuart: I was looking at the play before I saw the @H lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|dburn: question of whether this goes down quickly or slowly, I guess|pg||
nt|chorush: Only way to have beaten this contract is with a club lead and a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: 2NT artif prolly any gf hand with no suitable rebid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of gazzilli, just upscaled|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: just the manner, softly placing the card on the tray|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar: not the worst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: then asks who wants water; moss accepts|pg||
nt|rhelle: NS play reverse count and attitude - so the 4 is from an even number|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s8|nt|dburn: a club lead would mean quickly, this means slowly - assuming the defense does nothing silly|pg||
nt|wstuart: Doesn't 3 rds of @C beat it too, Ira?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: so far eldad has shown a strong 2 in @hs with questionable suit quality|pg||
nt|yuval10: double-dummy 6@h looks quite fair, but not today|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT is a kind of puppet, asking opener to come back to his opening suit|pg||
nt|ritong: unless ha has real good news|pg||

nt|harmon: be nice to tavel tod but that has dangers|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|ritong: they did not want to try the coup three in a row  remained possible, though|pg||
nt|ritong: in this context, 3@c instead of 2NT would be forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: here, pachtmann had relatively good news|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman seems always in control, never on tilt, never in a hurry|pg||
nt|ritong: moss cares about the excited part|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chorush: Eventually, declarer will lead a diamond toward the dummy and on the showout, will take 3 diamond tricks|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: he ruffed the queen? really?|pg||
nt|harmon: 6c hand was played from otherside and got a spade into the KJ made it easier I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|wstuart: True, though it doesn't really require a friendly layout to make.|pg||
nt|Jacki: Live streaming available here:   www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  If anyone knows the names of the players at the table, share with us|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: this one looks routine|pg||
nt|ritong: other room EW got offboard due to the systemic 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ritong: showing the equivalent of a very good weak 2 in @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: if you wonder how they treat very strong hands, big @c is the answer|pg||
nt|ritong: any 16+ hand is opened 1@c|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a school of thought that one shouldn't Michaels with a 6 card Maj, however, I don't know if much analysis has been done on 7-5 bidding.  :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  looks liek Robert Levin|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The East hand is worth an extra point, with those controls and the five-card spades.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the convention card that I am looking at, 2NT shows only 20-21. That's puzzling.|pg||
nt|dburn: Cheek may well lead a heart, which will work rather well for him|pg||
nt|hedyg: except the @s suit is not nice and stiff AK not great for NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he downgraded?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Top players rarely downgrade.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: Mind you, they don't miscount very often either.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have 20-21(22) may have a 5 card major|pg||
nt|wstuart: As you can see from the 3@S bid - Martel is a very aggressive player, which is why I was surprised when he downgraded a control righ 15 HCP to a 12-14 NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  and can't miss Meckstroth....|pg||
nt|robbg:  Weinstein (r) meck (l) with backs to us|pg||
nt|chorush: I would think Katz would close the bidding with 6 hearts here, unless he thinks he has a good way to get to 7 if it is there|pg||
nt|robbg:  Levin facing|pg||
nt|rhelle: systematically, NS have to open 1@h with 55 majors|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: a diamond wn't work so well|pg||
nt|algraves: hello everyone|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: 2@d is 18-19(20)|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, it may not work at all|pg||
nt|dburn: though declarer will still have to guess the play extremely well|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@S is a control bid in @S showing a good hand and making a slam try in @Hs.|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4NT is likely RKC|pg||
nt|wstuart: Katz will likely jump showing the number of keycards and a void.|pg||
nt|chorush: They will have a way to show a void but Katz cannot be sure the void is not opposite an ace, as it happens to be here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jillan:  3 aces and a spade void|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yuval10: 9 easy tricks from top|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is visibly sitting on the benefits|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry, got knocked off the internet but didn't miss any of the bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: seems normal|pg||
nt|wstuart: (RKC = Roman Keycard Blackwood) where there are 5 controls -  the 4 aces and the trump K.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "that's too fast", takes time to study dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: just trying to avoid big swings|pg||
nt|ritong: if he was not doing that, he would certainly raise @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss wrote: if you bid 1NT, X would be takeout. haven't discussed here|pg||
nt|ritong: which were freely bid by his pard|pg||
nt|hedyg: so now he knows no @D in N|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: 4d could be beaten2 so this is better|pg||
nt|rhelle: it bites them here ... 4@h or 4@s looks solid|pg||
nt|harmon: they play canape??|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: why @c rather than @H?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|bg: some may try to run club 8 now but not at imps risk of losing 4 dia tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he probably knew that anyway - he would not expect Cheek to lead from @dAQ108 only against 2NT - all pass|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|harmon: oh ok|pg||

nt|wstuart: Right - Nickell was playing it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: east took a short break|pg||
nt|wstuart: 6@D will make on this deal, but it is an odds-off contract.|pg||
nt|jillan:  can't they make 6@D here as the cards break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all players are back now|pg||
nt|chorush: This hand should be played in the very good 5 diamonds. 3NT undeservedly gains 2 imps so justice not served|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: east tried a 1NT overcall in other room i d be surprised to see gitelman duplicate this|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, they are surging ahead now|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: aside from being off the @SA, 6@D requires both the @H finesse and 2-1 @D which will fail 22% of the time.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: assuming 1@s is the response here|pg||
mb|d|nt|jillan:  I know the percentage BUT you can't argue with the layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Sadam Hussein would describe this as the mother of all misfits.|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South will do well to go plus on these|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: what about the 1NT rebid?|pg||
nt|chorush: Most players will not rebid a 5 card minor nor reverse with such skimpy values, so 1NT is chosen as the alternative|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|harmon: when they restarted Geoff shda passed:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: a nightmare to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Was 3@D available?|pg||
nt|dburn: better not bid any more, or he may have a doubled nightmare to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: will Lauria double if Cheek bids again?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 2@s showed 6-5...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: EW in trouble now|pg||
mb|d|nt|chorush: 50 years ago it would  have been universal to open East's hand 1 heart and rebid 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|r|nt|algraves: no could have been only 4 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't agree that it should show 5-6 (on the basis that North has denied four spades). That is a reasonable auction to describe a strong 4-6 hand. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: this contract has a lot of play|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h looks makeable, so Schwartz team likely gets some imps back|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman studying the trick before turning it|pg||
nt|ritong: trump looks clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: then why bid 3@H?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|ritong: 7|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz' 3H bid here is announcing some black suit worry|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: brad has doubled, and not with a trump stack|pg||
nt|ritong: so he has values, including @h control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann lowers screen, asks about carding, gitelman answers UDCA|pg||
nt|dburn: he doesn't have a bad hand for hearts, or so he hopes - that @sJ would be a working card, and he has an ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: The question was posed that if EW knew both hands, why would they not bid 6@D (not knowing the NS layout).|pg||
nt|rhelle: lead: either a small trump or the @dK|pg||
nt|harmon: prob d3 uless defense slips|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|algraves: down 2 or 3 it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, 3@d is pretty much bound to be hopeless unless partner miraculously has two of them|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever for Lauria to double, as I see it. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: ron tried a small @h to his stiff jack, but unfortunately moss was aware about that card|pg||
nt|jillan:  because it is a poor slam|pg||
nt|chorush: mainly because it is about a 41% contract|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: All I know for sure is that Hampson said 3@h showed 5 spades, 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: since if South delcares 3NT and West leads a club, South may have enough to set up and use the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: but it is now dangerous for the Cayne team, because this auction is off the rails|pg||
nt|algraves: Ishmael Del Monte is the best Australian player of his generation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Del Monte asked Seamon something and all I could hear of the answer was "this is all natural" (except for 3@c 4sf)|pg||
nt|algraves: and I suspect plays a lot of rubber bridge down under where it is still popular to have good rubber clubs|pg||

nt|wstuart: Since the IMP returns are +11 IMPs for 920 vs 420 and -10 IMPs for -50 vs -400, the slam needs to be an 11:21 favorite in order to break even, wihch is 52%|pg||

nt|algraves: so all reasonable lines of play will work it seems|pg||
nt|robbg:  anyway that is backwards, if those were the only 2 possible results the needed odds would be 10/21|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@D= fit and a singleton. 3@H asking etc|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzfe: fred asked about 3H and brad asked about 3D but I didn't get conclusive answers|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: a limited hand, no more than 4-5 controls|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is reassuring when he takes so long to work out the best plan. Makes you want to give up the game when they pick up 12 tricks without pausing for breath.|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not easy|pg||
nt|algraves: lol, very complicated if you are trying to make with spades 3-1 as you would like to ruff 3 clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: he may start @cA, club ruff, @dQ intending to pitch a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: or, I suppose, he may just take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: don't see any other serious runners, but far from clear which of those two is favourite|pg||
nt|harmon: I think he needs the ht finesse, but I let better analysts decide|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he may be thinking of heart finesse and then if that works to finesse club with fall back on 2-2 spades with king on side|pg||
nt|brolucius: East did choose the splinter bid art the other table and, as you see, they have netted 1430 at the other table. If you put your cursor over the result, you can see the auction.|pg||
nt|algraves: first really big hand of the match as slam may not be bid in other room|pg||
nt|algraves: oh i see|pg||
nt|algraves: that is a great feature|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump lead made it a bit easier.|pg||

nt|brolucius: We will see if he agrees with Allan by finessing in clubs next!|pg||

nt|harmon: Q of d my prediction|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|dburn: that may come now|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders will be muttering to themselves under their breath. 'How many finesses is this guy going to take?!'|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s lead in OR|pg||
nt|harmon: ok Q of d now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ruff a @c first|pg||
nt|brolucius: The famous English player, Jeremy Flint, used to advise that you commit a huge amount of energy to the important boards. Operation Big Deal. That is exactly what Versace is doing.|pg||
nt|dburn: ace of hearts also not impossible, just to see whether he needs a heart pitch at all, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that's probably too risky if the king doesn't drop|pg||

nt|brolucius: Another slam - just when I have to head for my wine-tasting. Ah well, it was 75 minutes very enjoyably spent. Bye!|pg||
nt|chorush: One of the disadvantages is that is allows the opponents to overcall freely at the one level. A major advantage is that it hinders the opponents from their natural bidding when ...|pg||
nt|chorush: they have the weak NT opener|pg||
nt|rhelle: as 1@d is artificial, 4@d must be pass or correct|pg||
nt|rhelle: North is looking for a save,|pg||
mb|d|nt|chorush: 2 clubs has not been alerted, but I believe it is a transfer to 2D which is a cue bid raise with 3 trumps|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe that should have been @D|pg||
nt|algraves: the downside to 2 suited interference is the distributional information it gives away|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: moss trying to find an escort to leave the room and ginossar tells him just to go|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|wstuart: Asked by a spec;  I think His DBL of 2@S is probably more strongly penalty oriented.|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: NS play precision so 1@D can be many kinds of hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: very nice slam - hard to bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for specs unfamiliar with the treatment    2N showed Balanced Game Force   a totally new concept that was introduced in 1920s|pg||
nt|bg: this pair obviously use 2nt as a balanced openig bid vs others who use Jacoby--both styles have their merits|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: awkward for South, this|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|wstuart: Did east miss his chance by not splintering over the 2@H rebid?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|dburn: still, what with Seamon going down in 3@d instead of making 3@h, I suppose the Cayne team was lucky that it had a poor board in both rooms|pg||

mb|3H!|an|2-2-5-4|mb|p|nt|wstuart: Many play that the higher cue is more trumps and less HCP then the lower cue.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: then they must untangle @S winners while retaining transportation in @H -- extremely unlikely|pg||
nt|bg: rebid of the minor usually shows 6 with 3 hearts better to raise hearts with unbalanced hand|pg||

nt|dburn: well, he doesn't know very much about spades - declarer could easily have four|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: really???   playing semi-force 1N  i would think 2@C usually 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Only pass 1NT with balanced minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4+ if min, (2)3+ if not min|pg||
nt|dburn: now in theory, declarer can make - but he may not bang down the ace of spades (or the queen)|pg||
nt|warrens:  even with a black card from E at trick 2, I think W gets endplayed|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: he didn't - he played for West to have @sKJ long, and to develop some endgame on that basis|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Now has the @d Q out|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I'm not sure Cayne was playing for a layout that would actually help|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|warrens:  a tough hand to play or defend.  I agree that 3 rounds of @c's after winning the @H at trick one was enough to beat it for sure|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S instead of 1N means Moss ON DEFENSE gets 100 honors|pg||

nt|ritong: but imps no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: even if few|pg||
nt|hedyg: far left is Cayne, far right Amoils|pg||

pc|cA|nt|rhelle: with the @hs breaking 22|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chorush: Nick won't|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's interesting that EW do'nt ahve any special methods here to try and get the contract played by the hand that has a @C stopper|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|chorush: Guess that is commentator's curse|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's reasonable to play pass to say he doesn't have any reason for a @C lead to come up to his hand, then try and get the major suit contracts played by east, who might have a @C ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: stopper.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: and a @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d by Versace would have shown both majors|pg||
nt|rhelle: the @C 9 was upside down count - the @s2 upside down attitude|pg||
nt|rhelle: so North has an odd number of @cs and likes @ss|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think this might make double dummy.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|ritong: best is to duck that|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh  bigtrain [Walter Johnson] says if scoring error  it would be Nickell +1 with 1 to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing our match had ANY spectators|pg||

nt|dburn: if only he knew - he had the ten of diamonds and the ten-eight of spades, which was plenty|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ritong: grue cheek found the red/white save|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Jan -- will we see 2 matches again tomorrow??|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Louk said: "sorry, not much"|pg||

nt|rhelle: 1@c = 16+|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|algraves: he had to draw exactly 2 @H then play on clubs. Lauria can win thrid club and play @S but you ruff in dummy and ruff club and play last heart to dummy to draw trumps|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 2 scores in  Fleisher leads by 37 over Onstott    Berg over Lynch by 74|pg||
nt|chorush: One moral of this story is that when you play cards to help partner, it may help declarer as much or more. the diamond 9 was a tipoff, with the K he would have no reason to ...|pg||
nt|chorush: discourage a diamond return|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3NT on these auctions shows specifically long and good @D since 2NT would be bid on 18-19 bal hands.|pg||

nt|rhelle: 3@c = mild invitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: on the other hand, 1NT with four trumps, a singleton and a king would be fancy|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: Bergen would bid 1@S-3@S   that might convince East to Pass|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and probably easier to find 9 tricks in 3@S than in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which really?   3@S with West   or   Pass from East??|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean 1) would bergen preempt two passed hands and 2) would west give up?|pg||
nt|ritong: esat*|pg||
nt|ritong: east**|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure 3@S -- descriptive     East Passing -- that's why i said "might"  only 5 trump, 3 quick outside losers [3@S won't have Ace]|pg||

nt|hedyg: they play variable 14-16 and 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Jan must have reconnected|pg||
nt|algraves: they play more like 13 to bad 16|pg||
nt|wstuart: An interesting consideration on these 3NT rebids is what opener's holding in responder's suit is - it's reasonable to define it as with showing 1 or less or 2 or more.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: There are many slam hands where that is the crucial and hard to determine peice of information if you don't ahve a specific agreemnt.|pg||
nt|rhelle: very hard to see ... you see, even at this level they slip up in defence|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: but teams can agree to start earlier|pg||
nt|ritong: an other difficult decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok we have the scores now, great!|pg||
nt|algraves: versace right on the rule of 2 or 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 tricks, no outside defense, classic|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: when raised, what to do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 1pm EDT = 5pm GMT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S easy  -- Moss 4@S probably easy too  since @Dxx|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rhelle: 1@d = 11-15, 3+@d, unbalanced|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: this is a real chance for Fleisher|pg||
nt|dburn: five diamonds (even six diamonds) look vastly preferable to 3NT|pg||
nt|wstuart: Prob 2NT showing the str NT?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: enterprising 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Open Room  Greco thought a long time before passing 3@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: short break and then 2nd segment|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: if in 4@S, i think declarer has a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: take the plus|pg||
nt|algraves: and lauria adds his three tricks and there you have it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wot hapen there?|pg||
nt|wstuart: but Chip will likely just kick it in to 3NT knowing he is facing at least some @H wastage for a slam.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could bid 3@h, just to make sure|pg||
nt|wstuart: true, they still have chances here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: good match, shakes hands with opps.  fred: good play cashing @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: thsi must imply a @D fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Stanby probably will bid 3S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i mentioned because South hand opposite a 14-16 NT improved during the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: well done Chip - knew you wouldn't let me down|pg||
nt|wstuart: I assume 3@C after 2NT would not have been forcing.|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know enuf about their methods|pg||
nt|wstuart: Although, after a 2 level nerg DBL opposite a str NT it seems like it should be.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h looks like a make - especially with the @d Ace before the king|pg||
nt|rhelle: a game on pretty minimal values|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if EW negotiate @C ruff beat is easy|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the other room North opened 1NT - for reasons he better understand than I|pg||
nt|rhelle: and they made slam tried, all the way to 5@h :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: this was a very exciting set, been a long time since I saw so many swings|pg||
nt|rhelle: at this level, that is - my Monday night game produces them as well :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chorush: Katz is going to have a good idea what to lead if it plays here|pg||
nt|wstuart: Chip's sequence expresses doubt about 3NT and Lew's stopper is surely about as weak as they come.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - he cant pass, can he?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|algraves: now diamond and diamond will eventually beat it|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we will be back about 15 minutes after all finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry lag not responding|pg||
nt|algraves: pershaps south did overtake and it was missed by recorder|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he just misguessed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I tried to key it|pg||
nt|algraves: thrid diamond, and if neccessary 4th diamond promotes trump ten|pg||
nt|hedyg: np Liz, you didnt a good job! thanks @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: you did a good job* my keyboard too!|pg||
nt|algraves: even if south did not overtake it seems natural for West to misguess the third diamond after south wins trump ace|pg||
nt|sillafu: how can he misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: Liz it is minus 1 for sure?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the result of -1 confirmed|pg||
