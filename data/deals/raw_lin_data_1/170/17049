nt|ehsana: both these teams ahve been winners however today it seems data steel is running all ove candyland|pg||
nt|ehsana: thye mean it is their product name :)|pg||
nt|ehsana: Tahir Massood and Jawad is a new partnership|pg||
nt|ady: good day all|pg||
nt|junaid: hello everyone again|pg||
nt|junaid: does this score include the carryover as well|pg||
nt|junaid: and does anyone know how much it was to begin with?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: this includes the carry over|pg||
nt|jcwla: Live from Karachi, the Pakistan Open Team National Trials.  Welcome to this second of five 12-board segments of the final, with Datasteel storming out to an early lead over Solox ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: through 20%.|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: and this segment is like the 7th game of tennis set...candyland have to make some inroads, they cant afford to fall too far back|pg||
nt|ehsana: Tehsin plays for Data steel|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcwla: Looks like a normal 4@S making 6 on the friendly layout.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|junaid: looks like a misundertanding right off the bat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: to me seems a difficult brd for both teams..anything can happen...declarer will face problems|pg||
nt|ady: west pass?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|junaid: please remember that NS are a first time partnership|pg||
nt|junaid: hello everyone|pg||
nt|junaid: welcome back for the 3rd segment|pg||
pc|h3|nt|junaid: a pretty light overcall by TM but thats his style and it has worked for him often enough|pg||
pc|hT|nt|junaid: and his partner should be surprised to find him w/ this hand|pg||
nt|junaid: should NOT|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|junaid: works out well|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ehsana: 2Nt may end up in the red :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back|pg||
nt|jcwla: This hand right at the tip-top of the range for the 2@C-2NT rebid.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: plucky balance from east    |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|junaid: S plays namyats, N does not:)|pg||
nt|junaid: but 3NT should make for EW tho it will take play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last segment of 12 boards|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|jcwla: Barry Crane: "God deals you A-K so you don't have a lead problem."|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk3: Udspil fra Jxxx koster altid et stik|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT   but would have to play well on a spade lead|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|Walddk3: Ingen undtagelse her|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tipu: hello again|pg||

nt|sybarra: may in fact be a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: Well seems not much bright chances for Gulzar Bilal|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|junaid: this is dicey for solox, not a hot result at the other table...an undesciplined pass by E|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: Rashidul Ghazi scrambled to game after Michaels with a passed hand partner at both nonvul, quite reasonable|pg||

pc|cT|nt|sybarra: oh how helpful of Defense|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|junaid: the defense had to help there...S needed to unblock @sQ|pg||

nt|ebrok: men spar ud er også 9 stik. |pg||
nt|junaid: and a correct @c guess would even allow him to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|junaid: this could turn into an 11imp pickup for sabres|pg||
nt|tipu: this will be an interesting segment as we all expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: North telling E to just enjoy his game and not take any pressure :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ehsana: any bets on 4S by East:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|tipu: rightly so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Karen Allison|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oosmanb: Surely cant be namyats, if South has AK@H... |pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|tipu: W is a man likely to get under pressure in these situations|pg||
nt|kareno:  Good morning from cloudy New York City :)|pg||
nt|tipu: Hello Karen|pg||
nt|tipu: but East is as cool as ice:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: But I guess if you agreed on a convention and it comes your way, you trust it :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|ady: part score hand   e/w 3@C|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ehsana: 5D on too|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead should beat it and w/ trump control, TM will likely find the lead and then finding entry in N hand is not a matter of choice, only one option|pg||
nt|ehsana: 5D playable cntrct|pg||
nt|tipu: East Uzair Kamal is responsible for making a lit of good yougsters to excell |pg||
nt|tipu: lot |pg||
nt|Walddk4: West you mean|pg||
nt|jcwla: S elects to make the 3@C despite holding only six @C and a mediocre four-card @H suit on the side, finds a nice catch.  A pass might have kept NS out of the auction entirely, and ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: now a super-protective reopening double by E and N is in a happy place.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|junaid: nothing else makes sense...also, has no one every opened namyats missing the AK of trumps?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oosmanb: No, by definition|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tipu: yes West|pg||
nt|tipu: thnk God I mentioned the name Uzair I meant:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yasser Rahim|pg||
nt|yr: hi all|pg||
nt|tipu: welcome Yasir|pg||
nt|yr: a strange looking contract here,, 5@c is more normal|pg||
nt|kareno:  What was the 1@c bid?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|yr: this should go down on accurate defence|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|ebrok: Det var en rigtig stor pas i øst!?|pg||
nt|junaid: even then, E can bank on @hs for @c pitches after 2 rounds of trumps...interesting play problem|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oosmanb: However  NS might get lucky, since 4@S nor 5@C makes on the last board, on correct defence|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|ady: should be 10 tricks without spade lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|junaid: no option here but to hook|pg||
nt|ehsana: early pressure :)|pg||
nt|junaid: Qxx in N way less probable|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: Yes, what was 1@C|pg||
nt|yr: i really have no idea what wwas 1@c,,maybe a psych|pg||
mb|2C|nt|junaid: true, but unless @s is played by N, there will be no @c lead and then W will have to shift to a @c after a high @d lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  dom Ã¤r lÃ¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥ngsamma vid andra bordet|pg||
nt|ady: north may go to game|pg||

mb|d|nt|vugraphzaa: allt är relativt :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: men Troberg-Knutsson är nog bland de långsammare paren i den här tillställningen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: little to make here    2@S  may or may not make|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: and sibanda just hit a 4 off gul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hardly when West bid 2@D|pg||
nt|kareno:  5@c down on diamond ruff assuming north leads that or a heart.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|ehsana: face savings pass of 2D by East|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe they play reversed minor openings?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: apologies for the lack of play on last brd, E/W's hands were dealt the other way round here|pg||
nt|yr: then maybe operator error|pg||
nt|tipu: another unlucky contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|junaid: well done by EW, not easy to reach...friendly black suits lie will allow it to make|pg||
nt|ady: only 2 top losers   but no way to make 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Offshape double will not deter them.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|junaid: 9 top tricks here|pg||
nt|junaid: 10 now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|oosmanb: I think that's a very reasonable defence, after A@D, dummy is void in @h so no future there, you can see 10@C so pd might even be ruffing the first one|pg||
nt|ajq: this may be the 10th :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT certainly will make on that lead|pg||
nt|kareno:  Yes, doomed on the spade lead|pg||
nt|junaid: not anymore|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk3: Brunzell är i 3NT vid andra bordet|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kareno:  That explains the auction!!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk3: 1 bet snart|pg||
nt|junaid: strange decision from E not to invite, but this might work out quite well|pg||
nt|junaid: i keep getting proven wrong...lol|pg||
nt|ady: east needs to play low|pg||

nt|ady: well played|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno:  So are they dealt backwards in the CR also?  or is that a fouled board?|pg||

nt|ady: dubious for west to rake action|pg||

nt|jcwla: So S rewarded for a call that described the essence of what the hand was about.|pg||
nt|ajq: hello|pg||
nt|junaid: to put it mildly|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Ahsan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: skipping brd 15 for the time being, will get back to it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Has north an opening bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s have possibilities of a minor suit slam|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|ehsana: 4H by East ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: EW are really fast players  so i can understand the operator having problems|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno:  Nice diamond slam ifthey dan find it.|pg||
nt|tipu: yes right|pg||
nt|ajq: the pair of Chandna and Liaqat have done very well during the round robin matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: this should be a routine 4@h contract|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT  also look likely to make|pg||
nt|ady: can take 13 tricks on good heart view|pg||
nt|kareno:  can|pg||
nt|tipu: minor slam|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubtless south will get to 4 spades now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oosmanb: 4 of either major seems fine|pg||
nt|ehsana: a major game for E/W|pg||
nt|jcwla: A normal light opener here with A-A-K connected, I don't love 2NT with such woeful @D's but if ever this is the vul for it, 3@C looks like invitational or better values with @H's, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: and 5@C escapes without an ax.|pg||
nt|junaid: omg...trump leads are almost mandatory in such acutions|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 4S will be take n to teh Cleaners |pg||
nt|ady: likely to end in small slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 4S looks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 3NT bästa kontrakt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|junaid: S hand tailor made for walsh, showing 4441 GF|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well defence can still prevail|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but needs to be careful|pg||
nt|ady: chance on this lead|pg||
nt|ady: about the only lead it can make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ehsana: strange double|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: S asked W if 4@h was weak|pg||
pc|d8|nt|junaid: it would've ended up going to the cleaners if EW dbled, but that is not a clear at the table action|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: 3@d inquired about, alerted as natural|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Kommer att gå hem i 4@S också när klövermasken ordnar sig|pg||
nt|jillan:  det hÃ¤r borde gÃ¥ bra ocksÃ¥, eftersom bl a @S J Ã¤r hos Ã¶st|pg||
nt|oosmanb: After that lead.. yes :) declarer must be scared|pg||
nt|yr: here comes the good old 4nt,,,,|pg||
nt|junaid: not that it would make a difference here|pg||
nt|junaid: since the contract is not dbld|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well the heart was best, but on some lines there is a trump promo it seems|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|ehsana: my humble opinion 4S bettr than 4H :)|pg||
nt|tipu: yes they did|pg||
nt|tipu: still have to guess the @c right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|junaid: even now they seem to be on their way to 6m...needs luck, but its there, minors breaking and one of the two red hooks on|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT has merit here as 6@D might fail with bad trump split and badly place with 6NT making |pg||
nt|vugraphzar: explained, rather than alerted|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|yr: its normal to play some sort of Kickback in minor suit slam auctions but NS here are from the old school|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzar: 3@h sorry|pg||
nt|kareno:  Pitch on heart|pg||
nt|yr: the declarer is Very competent & id bet on him making this|pg||
nt|tipu: I meant @s|pg||
nt|tipu: thnx for correcting Karen|pg||
nt|junaid: N showed something like a 5431 and S chose to play game in a 4-3 fit at the 4 level rather than in 5@c...very reasonable from S's angle|pg||
pc|d5|nt|junaid: :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S10 will doom it|pg||
nt|ady: yes   4th diamond|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if the diamond is cashed, trump ten can be promoted, otherwise 2 hearts to lose|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|ehsana: some systems can expose dual major holdings:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: making this harder by messing up entries for @C ruffs.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|junaid: luckily for dec only one way hook available in @d and that happens to work|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|h9|nt|ehsana: In 4S he had almost 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: no way of knowing which 4 is better during auction|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so lets call them both good contracts :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|junaid: thats another result DS can take to the bank|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno:  Yes, but it's normal to play the spades for queen (at least) on declarer's right.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ehsana: .BUT 4H struggles :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Sabres have picked up 14 imps for board 1|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|oosmanb: Seldom contracts that struggle, only declarers :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno:  He needed to play the spade when he was in dummy with the diamond ace!!|pg||

pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ehsana: 4H and 3Nt  both possible with N/S|pg||
nt|junaid: 5@d should be reachable now?|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

nt|jcwla: W elects not to go to war with just K-fourth opposite E's shortness and they've chosen the @H game which can come home.|pg||

nt|ady: weak 2  or multi South?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: discussions among both partnerships before proceeding to the next board|pg||
nt|junaid: i think N has to refuse the ruff to give E problems, but declarer should still prevail|pg||
mb|1D|nt|junaid: not worth it imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@C-X-P-??|pg||

mb|1S|nt|yr: good try by declarer but he was destined for faliure|pg||
mb|2C|nt|oosmanb: More imps for sabres in brd 14|pg||
nt|ehsana: part game for N/S|pg||
nt|junaid: actually, not even close imo...but declarer might have enough confidence in the defensive discards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yr: a typical modern day 3rd seat opener|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: spade intervention made that difficult |pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 200 points in each direction..should be a good tussle to buy the cntrct :)\|pg||
nt|ehsana: sryyyyyyyyyyyyy 20 points|pg||
nt|junaid: sabres have come out firing:)|pg||
nt|ady: no problems here    might even make 10 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@D certainly can't be accused of overbidding.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oosmanb: :) I was wondering if you multiply your scale by 10 for the fun of it|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Would be interesting,, 150-170 1NT :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Just to confuse the opponents|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: This is the kind 1NT contract I hate declaring|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|oosmanb: @D seems to be the best suit. pip wise|pg||
nt|junaid: now...how many would pass 1@c here w/ a fit and an A?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|junaid: they've gotten lucky here, W should support @ds and then no idea where u'll end up|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ehsana: question is how many down :)|pg||
nt|yr: but the problem with this for a normal partnership is u have to pass a 1@s response,,,not so much for them as they play 1@s response to 1@h as 5+|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead good    cutting off route to clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 7 was needed!|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like going 2 or 3 down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we can see all cards, but the club J makes 3 tricks difference|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as a heart lead now kills the clubs for -3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|ady: spade lead was best even into AQ  as long as north wins first round of clubs and plays a 2nd spade|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, this was souths only lead to give declarer a chance|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|junaid: this should lose 2@c, 1@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|junaid: claimer for 6 now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzar: and done so|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: yes   7@C  on first round and contract makes   |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: if defence attacks clubs  that gives declarer an extra trick to discard a diamond  and if they dont attack clubs declarer can set up 4th diamond to discard a club|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Opportunity missed for Solox|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: hearts 3-3 as well|pg||
pc|cT|nt|oosmanb: South should cash K@H before that exit, |pg||
nt|oosmanb: make life easier for N to cash out|pg||
pc|c6|nt|oosmanb: South could be caught on an endplay if North ducks this trick|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and if he overtakes he's himself endplayed|pg||
nt|junaid: but N should know that S doesnt have another @s so he cant let his entry go|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oosmanb: -1|pg||
nt|yr: still down via uppercut|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oosmanb: The 2@S bid caused problems for East. who couldnt bid 2NT anymore|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But I think the 2@D bid over 2@C cue caused the problem|pg||
nt|oosmanb: West had a very nice overcall|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Perhaps he couldve still recovered with 3@S over 3@D (showing @S stop) asking for @C?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ajq: happy ending for Solox on this board, there was every reason go over board|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, and given that N found a passout-seat raise with nothing but losers, S with this hand might have thought about one more push.|pg||

nt|yr: well its still down,,but cudaa ben more|pg||

nt|junaid: unlikely to get to game, but if S somehow manages to get there, he might very well make it on a @d lead|pg||
nt|yr: the other table also played 5@d & went down in 17 for a push|pg||
nt|yr: 14 i mean|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so good recovery, but spade switch gave it it seems|pg||
nt|ady: I got disconnected    but when J@C lost to the king  looked at best 7 tricks?|pg||
nt|ady: better of to have led the spade in 1st place|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 1@h- (1NT) |pg||
nt|oosmanb: interesting from that point on :)|pg||
nt|junaid: i dont see why u wouldnt cash it, u can see the @ds controlled in your own hand and pard has clearly signalled for @s...but its not that clear at the table|pg||
nt|junaid: that board was a disaster for solox as well|pg||
mb|1S|nt|oosmanb: i think K@C is crystal clear :)|pg||

nt|tipu: a lot will depend on   16 result|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: anyone for 4H :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: In any case you're not establishing a trick for declarer by cashing K@H and are unblocking yourself, so I just dont see how it loses|pg||
nt|junaid: yes it is...w/ the @s in dummy, u dont know if pard's entry is the A or K and your own holding is such that if u play @s before @d u may set up their tricks there and if play @d ...|pg||
nt|junaid: before u may set up tricks there|pg||
nt|junaid: entry is usually not the only issue going thru your mind and sometimes that makes u do funny things at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I like 4@H at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|junaid: yes, nice bid|pg||
nt|junaid: wonder what chandna is thinking|pg||
nt|oosmanb: In the other room South had a chance to bring this 3NT home but didnt take it |pg||
nt|junaid: they had a chance for a nice pickup, an opportunity missed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ehsana: 4H play should be interesting too :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4NT for minors??? Surely not|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely to play 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|junaid: surely not about sacrificing...but surely not about dbling either:)|pg||

nt|junaid: tricky board|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: this shd end the auction but u never know with umer at the helm|pg||
nt|junaid: lack of aces is the main problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 2NT asks 3 or 4@S I suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|ebrok: 4 sp i N-S|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Better not lead a @D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|oosmanb: Still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|junaid: but NS negotiate it extremely well...but the pass from N is very strange|pg||

pc|sA|nt|junaid: both of making mistakes on the same lead...lol|pg||

nt|oosmanb: might be easier here since he can see dummies @h quality?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: The 9xx @D with East is stopping 3@D tricks|pg||

pc|s4|nt|jcwla: These auctions are a bit too courteous for me.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|oosmanb: But notice that declarer can win 3@S tricks, by finessing the 10|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|junaid: S was given a chance to make 3NT but he made a play that could not succeed...but by then he had to drop the stiff @d honor from W, still better hope than none|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Yes. over here, West wouldve gotten 1 more chance when in with Q@S|pg||
nt|junaid: yes, but w/ N as declarer, this switch is not so hard to find. at the other table W never switched to @h|pg||
nt|junaid: it was much harder to do it there|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yes agreed|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|h5|nt|junaid: crucial @d guess involved here...and the defense solves that one for him|pg||

nt|ehsana: another 4H coming up :)|pg||
nt|junaid: this not looking too good for solox, DS are not only playing better, they're getting the better of luck as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1NT rebid looks best after 1@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 4@H again here inspite of @S ruff|pg||
nt|yr: Hasan askari showed a lot of restraint in 15 to play in 3@c & earn 6 imps for his team|pg||
mb|2D|nt|oosmanb: 2@S was making here, so 3@H - 2 wont be that bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: wajahat and Kamal have played a lot together and they are a good pair, though they've been playing with different partners through this tourney|pg||
nt|oosmanb: What does W bid here? |pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3NT?|pg||
nt|ady: re all   had connection problem|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I like 1@S more than 2@S by North|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ehsana: now in 4H ..spade ruff a surety :)|pg||
nt|junaid: that:)|pg||
nt|yr: its pretty tempting to simply bid 3N or at least invite|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: wrong claim ojn the last board, the score will be adjusted. contract was 1nt-2|pg||
nt|junaid: 3NT unbeatable from S but down 2 on a @h lead from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: dbl should be routine w/ 18 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: But perhaps 2@S now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: dubbelt?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: sure|pg||
nt|junaid: no other clear bid...clear case of the F word - Flexible|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I like K10x Of @S and AQ@d sitting over 2@s bid though|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ehsana: ponts equally distributed a part game struggle|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: not after 4@s though:)|pg||
nt|ehsana: $s is a doomed cntrct unless teh defenders wabt to prove me wrong :)|pg||
nt|farrukh: makes on @s lead only|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Good lead on both tables|pg||
nt|ady: this looks several down|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ehsana: 4S,,,|pg||
nt|ady: easy  3NT here|pg||
nt|junaid: and E should bid it too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oosmanb: But you dont know about @H fit so cant see source of tricks in 3NT.. Dbl seems best :)|pg||
nt|junaid: again u can see this is a new partnership...earlier N passed S's 1@c w/ a fit and an A and now S bids 1@s...they dont seem to be on the same plane|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|junaid: solox could get lucky here for an 11imp pickup|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yr: well a 4th best lead,,,its a rarity in this partnership,,they usually lead attitude cards|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yr: low likes,,, high dislikes|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk3: Hur kräver man med klöver då?|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|oosmanb: Now a discard setup on Q@C|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|junaid: on the run of the @cs, S has to pitch @hs and he ends up either blocking the @s suit or giving up @ds to give dec an OT|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|oosmanb: do we need to play this out?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c9|nt|jbennet: kanske D är UD i 2:a läget. |pg||

nt|ehsana: 1 Imp difference ONLY :)..not comfy|pg||
nt|junaid: actually no, the same tricks, as in, no difference|pg||
nt|ehsana: N/S  can go wrong again in abidding a major game|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: does'nt E get a @h ruff as well junaid bhai?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This was good for DS, Tullo opened 2@S @S + minor|pg||
nt|junaid: if they do, the 4@s going down is going to loom large on them|pg||
mb|1D|nt|farrukh: As they say down 1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: effectively shutting out opponent's @H|pg||
nt|junaid: thats another good result for DS|pg||
mb|2H|an|weak|nt|ady: 11 easy tricks in spades for e/w  and 12 if defence slip|pg||
nt|yr: sabres were the underdogs in this semi final,,,i must say they have played really well until now|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 16, where S played a quiet 5@C-1 here, the same contract was doubled and down 3 on a trump lead in the CR - hence an even bigger lead for DS.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ehsana: another possible 4H :):)|pg||
nt|junaid: but remember there must have been some carryover for solox, so sabres have outscored them in this match so far|pg||
nt|junaid: its what they call a plus position...if a swing occurs, it will be in the favour of DS...unless of course if something unusual happens|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Yes this session is 21-3|pg||
nt|tipu: here it comes 11 Imp's in Brd   16 for Sabers|pg||
nt|yr: nobody was giving them even a remote chance|pg||
nt|ady: 6 of either minor   but need luck with K@D singleton|pg||
mb|3N|nt|junaid: game in either black suit on for EW|pg||
nt|junaid: but it may get passed out in 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: right, neither does @d through work for an extra trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Matter of agreement - would expect it to be forcing one round for many or most.|pg||
nt|ajq: Chandna can re-value his hand and bid the game on his own|pg||
nt|junaid: i think he was always going to bid it, whether it makes or not|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|oosmanb: if 3@H was limit, it was a nice bid|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  could be a disaster    |pg||
pc|s7|nt|junaid: nicely done again...now u just need to make it:)|pg||
nt|junaid: even 6@c is a good sc|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can save at the 6 level for 500|pg||
nt|tipu: yes and the reason for that was purely the way they qualified   by only 1 VP margin|pg||
pc|s8|nt|junaid: dont see any problems there though|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|junaid: difficult for E to play S for 3 Js only|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|junaid: the only possible entry in W hand could be the @sA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: neither north or south sees fit to support his partners suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzkt: Datasteel Vs Candyland 48 - 15|pg||
nt|yr: that result just goes on to prove MEcstroths famous words " there are a lot of ways to win imps with a plus 480/490"|pg||
nt|tipu: as anothe team lost their last match 25-01:)|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead will allow it to make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: It doesn't come into play here b/c EW happens to have the hand - but 2@C over 1@D and 2@D over 1@C are great bids that put tremendous pressure on even good opps - so often they are ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: faced with tough choices whether to pass, make an imperfect negative double, or fudge their strength to show their suit.|pg||
nt|ajq: good bidding, even if Spades are J to four, 5C can make|pg||
nt|ady: may be bing swing for Solox|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: no blame attached to south    save could have been a phantom|pg||
nt|junaid: of course|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ady: big|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ehsana: strange play |pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosmanb: hmmm I dont know about the 2@S lead.. perhaps 10 to ask for @D if pd wins the trick?|pg||
nt|tipu: if they would ve lost 25-02 they would ve gone through:(|pg||
pc|d2|mc|6|nt|yr: mean while declarer plays another thin 1N contract|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You should also make 6, as singleton king in either hand is more likely than the jack with East|pg||
nt|junaid: he can hope to play E for stiff J|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: let me check some thing wrong here|pg||

mb|p|nt|yr: but 3N more likely|pg||
nt|kareno:  3nt more likelu|pg||
nt|junaid: solox picked up anoter 11 imps on board 30|pg||

nt|oosmanb: actually 6@d not that good|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: certainly 2@H and a diamond to lose in 4@H   and 4-1 break awkward|pg||
nt|ajq: Heart lead can sink the contract|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|yr: @h 10 id guess|pg||
nt|yr: as a lead knowing E|pg||
pc|d7|nt|junaid: well...it needs @ds to break for starters...and then either, if no @ds losers u need to hold @s losers to 1, and if a @d loser then u have to play @ss for no losers...|pg||

nt|junaid: 23 another good result for DS|pg||
nt|junaid: in CR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yr: yeah,,,but the point was that W held  a good hand so E cant have enough entries to establish & cash winners in a new suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Sidste 12 spil i weekenden|pg||
nt|junaid: but solox may get pushed there similarly|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|junaid: alright alright, i'll lower my expectations...lol|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oosmanb: 6@D makeable on inspired play... instead of finessing Q,, you can play @S to K and then Jack.. pinning doubleton 10 and promoting 9|pg||
nt|ehsana: 9tricks in spades |pg||
nt|kareno:  1nt by north I think, whether he opens it or rebids it|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|junaid: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: There's a theory that says.. in computer deals.. if you're in a "bad" slam... its usually still makeable but on antipercentage plays usually|pg||
nt|junaid: wow|pg||
nt|junaid: pass by E amazing|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: NS bid rather agressively to a failing game contract in the other room so a pickup for Solox likely here|pg||

pc|h4|nt|Walddk3: 7@C og ingen dobling fra Willquist :)|pg||
nt|ebrok: det var da en start!!|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 2@D in here on 19 was not duplicated in the CR, where NS got to 5@D doubled and down 2 -- 9 more to DS.|pg||
nt|ajq: 3NT or 5D both making on D fin for EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: And the hits keep coming.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well there is good news and bad news about that @D finesse.|pg||
nt|junaid: what can E have for his 5@h bid? |pg||
nt|junaid: W had to take a shot at slam imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: West just lays the cards down in style. Not saying a word, and claiming the rest |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ehsana: probably over reached again |pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oosmanb: 3NT struggles too|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk3: Det er ganske vist rigtigt, at ØV har en renonce, men det er Øst, og det er i trumf :)|pg||
nt|junaid: if W can bid 4@d, can he try 3NT on the way? he's already passed 3@d once |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kareno:  Aggressive is an understatement!|pg||

nt|khaled_m: yes|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|junaid: a good reason is that holding a wk hand, its quite often a good move to start w/ your 4 card suit because u're more likely to find help from partner there|pg||
