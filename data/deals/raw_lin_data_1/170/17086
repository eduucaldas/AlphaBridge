mb|p|nt|athene: and bid some number of spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: opening and closing his hand is Bas|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: He is now doing the thinking man pose|pg||
nt|athene: if you bid 5@S now is that only asking for a heart control|pg||
nt|athene: or is it just a general invitation?|pg||
nt|athene: partner could have a pretty respectable double and you could still be off a spade trick and the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: not easy|pg||
nt|athene: this is why i think it's good to open 4 of a major more often than most people do|pg||
nt|athene: you give the opponents a lot of headaches|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|athene: now south has a heart control AND good spades|pg||
nt|athene: so it will be hard to turn this one down|pg||
nt|athene: since those are the two things that 5@S usually asks for|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand south hasn't got anything else |pg||
nt|athene: so he might just pass anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Brink now thinking with hands on chin|pg||

nt|athene: too much work for a 4-4 trump fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: unlikely S plays @S now which could help declarer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even down 2 (thought that was impossible here)?|pg||
nt|athene: of course one advantage of reaching a doomed game these days is you know at least they will be going down in it in the other room too :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: small consolation though:)|pg||
nt|athene: brink thinking whether he needs to attack clubs before declarer sets up a spade, or whether he needs to play a trump to stop ruffs, or what|pg||
nt|athene: thin game contracts on 4-4 trump fits are hard to defend because there are many possible lines of defence which could be right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and he is still thinking:)???|pg||

nt|athene: he can plod away at a long-term strategy like cutting your communications with dummy for instance|pg||

nt|athene: assuming you get the diamonds right you can just cash out for 9|pg||

nt|athene: playing on the majors might see east win the @HA and west win a lot of spades|pg||

nt|athene: but in "normal" circumstances playing imps you just don't take these chances|pg||

pc|dK|nt|athene: "safety" finessing diamonds to keep east off lead to protect the @SKx isn't safe, though, is it?|pg||

nt|athene: do you have to ruff the @SQ down for a heart pitch?|pg||
nt|athene: or is there something better?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, spot on with this lead - not so spot on if North had chanced to lead a heart|pg||
nt|gavin:  drijver expects dummy to hit with weakness in both majors|pg||
nt|gavin:  since east could have bid 3@H or 3@S in an effort to reach 3NT|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: if you assume EW do have one major totally wide open|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree leading a heart can just give the contract so many times, a trump looked normal|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d on the 4-3 fit was good enough for 4 IMPs to Nickell|pg||
nt|athene: are there any sort of extra board things if the match is very close?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down in @H??|pg||
nt|dburn: when Wold and Bates tried 3NT, down, rather than 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: or is 1 imp a win?|pg||
nt|dburn: one is enough|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, 0.1 is enough if the Director imposes some adjustment or other|pg||
nt|athene: zia going for the psychological line|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told 7 extra boards if a tie|pg||
nt|dburn: he's not doing anything psychological particularly - maybe he can endplay North|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if N sees pd with @HK (no 3nt bis W) he plays x@H for @D switch i think|pg||
nt|dburn: "psychological" would be a low spade to the jack|pg||
nt|athene: well he did have the option of ruffing a spade to drop the queen|pg||
nt|dburn: he still does|pg||
nt|athene: and then throwing a heart from dummy on his @S10|pg||
nt|athene: yes but now he has let the defence cash two hearts|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a spec says S had to play @HK direct based on the same reasoning ( W not 3nt)|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||

nt|jaapfr: if my pd had @HK why he did not play it direct|pg||
nt|athene: i still think there was an element of psychology in the way zia played this|pg||
nt|athene: he was just relying on the fact that south would not take his honour|pg||
nt|athene: and he was known to have the king probably from the opening lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okay lost the play they did it so fast now|pg||

nt|gavin:  looks doable, north is entitled to 3 natural trump tricks, plus one heart ruff |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|gavin:  (they can get hte heart ruff by discarding a heart on the 3rd round of clubs)|pg||
nt|athene: three small in opener's suit proves a bad holding for the overcaller once again|pg||
nt|dburn: will Meckwell bid 3NT? is the Pope a Catholic?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: may be yes:)|pg||
nt|gavin:  however they must play a diamond through before taking the heart ruff, as declarer would use the 13th heart to pitch a diamond|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gavin:  compressing the diamond loser with one of the trump losers|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: as reply to yr 2nd question:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: meckwell will open south 1@D not 1@C of course, which makes the penalty pass fractionally less appealing, maybe?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: since north has more length in the bid suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia asking discards|pg||
nt|gavin:  south's club was suit preference for diamonds i imagine|pg||
nt|gavin:  since south knew that north was leading from shortness|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|gavin:  and north knew that south knew because declarer ducked (therefore south has the queen)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway a new leader expected after this board|pg||
nt|gavin:  so i expect a diamond from drijver |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gavin:  and the rest plays itself, an easy discard of a heart for north on the club|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|gavin:  or not so|pg||
nt|athene: this will work too; north just has to avoid getting endplayed, and south still has an entry with the heart, so there is no problem|pg||
nt|dburn: he can discard anything - as long as he doesn't pitch a trump, he should be OK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|dburn: but not now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: they do anything you ask (roughly same age as NS Gavin:)? |pg||
nt|gavin:  now overtake in dummy and lead a heart ?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence just had to make use of south being on lead, and playing another diamond wasn't really doing that|pg||
nt|athene: i think south expected that north would have a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha they failed here once to listen (at least Bas did)|pg||
nt|athene: and hence would be ruffing this trick|pg||
nt|athene: since north shifted to a BIG diamond from three small|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||

pc|dT|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: a kibitzer suggests north could have tried MUD in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. lead middle card to try to deny an honour but then follow with the higher one to deny a doubleton|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y would work fine then |pg||

nt|imp_jan: very very close match still|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 21 count and 5-3 fit, that is going some|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dburn: indeed they did - could be rather important, that one spade doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: it remains extremely tight with 2 boards to go|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|athene: there's no redress for incorrect acceptance of claim even after the board is over is there?|pg||
nt|dburn: yes|pg||
nt|athene: let alone after the set is over|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: oh ok|pg||
nt|dburn: even then|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|gavin:  i expect a 2@S bid by zia|pg||
nt|dburn: they have until the end of the Correction Period (usually 30 minutes after the end of play)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: rdbl = 3@h|pg||
nt|gavin:  i think he will not sell out to 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  this looks to be a pretty good spot, typically 4-3 fits are worse when the opponents can force you to ruff with your 4 card suit|pg||
nt|athene: NS should know this is a 4-3 fit because with four spades zia would have bid them first time|pg||
nt|gavin:  here it doesnt cause much concern with trumps breaking|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: getting forced in the long trump holding is only bad if you really fear losing trump control|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i still believe that with the last 4 tricks left W played @S and N returned @S (easier to believe 1 player did something wrong then that 3 players were wrong about the claim)|pg||
nt|athene: and that is only bad if you have some big side suit you need to cash|pg||
nt|jaapfr: b59|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia says solid and then thank you and lead in partners suit is ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they all agreed to claim|pg||
nt|athene: often at a low level you can just go with it if they force you, and scramble a healthy number of tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gavin:  these guys have a lot of experience playing in 4-3 fits, two of the best in the game at it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks|pg||
nt|athene: well hamman used to play 4-card majors|pg||
