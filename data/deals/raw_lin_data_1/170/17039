nt|ehsana: both these teams ahve been winners however today it seems data steel is running all ove candyland|pg||
nt|ehsana: thye mean it is their product name :)|pg||
nt|ehsana: Tahir Massood and Jawad is a new partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: and this segment is like the 7th game of tennis set...candyland have to make some inroads, they cant afford to fall too far back|pg||
nt|ehsana: Tehsin plays for Data steel|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|junaid: looks like a misundertanding right off the bat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: to me seems a difficult brd for both teams..anything can happen...declarer will face problems|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|junaid: please remember that NS are a first time partnership|pg||
mb|2H|nt|junaid: a pretty light overcall by TM but thats his style and it has worked for him often enough|pg||
mb|2N|nt|junaid: and his partner should be surprised to find him w/ this hand|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ehsana: any bets on 4S by East:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|oosmanb: Surely cant be namyats, if South has AK@H... |pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ehsana: 5D on too|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead should beat it and w/ trump control, TM will likely find the lead and then finding entry in N hand is not a matter of choice, only one option|pg||
nt|ehsana: 5D playable cntrct|pg||
mb|4S|nt|junaid: nothing else makes sense...also, has no one every opened namyats missing the AK of trumps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: No, by definition|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ebrok: Det var en rigtig stor pas i øst!?|pg||
nt|junaid: even then, E can bank on @hs for @c pitches after 2 rounds of trumps...interesting play problem|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|oosmanb: However  NS might get lucky, since 4@S nor 5@C makes on the last board, on correct defence|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Hi|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|junaid: true, but unless @s is played by N, there will be no @c lead and then W will have to shift to a @c after a high @d lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|ehsana: For Cricket Lovers...Zimbawi  9 for 2 in 4 overs  against Pakistan |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzaa: allt är relativt :)|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think that's a very reasonable defence, after A@D, dummy is void in @h so no future there, you can see 10@C so pd might even be ruffing the first one|pg||

nt|farrukh: @c lead was correct only thing that could make declarer go wrong after cashing 2@cs was a @h shift|pg||
mb|1C|nt|farrukh: now he had multiple options|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|farrukh: either finesse a @h or go up with the king assuming @s are 3-3 and he guesses it right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Solox Vs Sabres 39 - 59|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: so on a @d lead, do you play for 3-3 @S or 4-2 and @H finesse|pg||
nt|oosmanb: if you play third @S they have entries for the @D ruff|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|farrukh: after @d lead you know that @s are not braking and the leader is likely to hold long @s so you need to finesse @h and get rid of your @c loser|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|oosmanb: if you play AK and then finesse @H twice to discard @C, thats good declarer play.. but the definition of a "test' |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I dont think you know any such thing. When you lead your singleton you should NOT have a natural trump trick|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so there's no evidence to Qxxx or Qxx either way|pg||

pc|dA|nt|oosmanb: as it is.. you lose 11 by not dbling|pg||
