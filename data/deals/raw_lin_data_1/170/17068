pc|dA|nt|henryb:  this appears to have six losers, but I think the defense will have difficulty collecting all their tricks. West will probably get end played at some point|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|brolucius: There is a heart loser if spades are trumps, so they will hope to end in clubs.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if one of the ice relay experts could translate, it would be more enjoyable for the masses|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: That will allow two heart discards from the East hand on West's spades.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: and 11+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|brolucius: Relay bids tend to be the next available bid, so you can see that West's bids are all relays, after the strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is a about a 2% chance that an auction of this type does not end in 7@C. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I am in the camp that finding good slams is good for the game, even if the method is somewhat opaque|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The other table has stopped in 6@S, I am told.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: baldursson thinking, scratching  his forehead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Magnus Magnusson|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hurray!!!|pg||
nt|iceking: hehe i used to play this system 10 years ago. But today i dont remember any of it:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: You liar! Of course you can explain all these relay bids.|pg||
nt|iceking: What is going on though is Baldursson is asking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nunes now reading the daily bulletin|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does that explain the system?|pg||
nt|iceking: Jonsson first shows bal hand GF no 5card major no stiff |pg||
nt|iceking: then his shape-controls-location of controls-locations of Q in the end|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: for everyone not in louisville: www.acbl.org/nabc will get you to the daily bulletins|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the face of it, this should be exactly the right type of deal for a relay system. But the long pause is worrying - for Icelandic fans.|pg||
nt|iceking: so in the end Baldursson will know Jonsson has 3controls-control in Black suits and @H Q and @C Q|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'Either the connection has failed or... perhaps they are playing a relay system.'|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: baldursson briefly makes motions with his hand as if counting|pg||

mb|r|nt|harmon: not a good leaner Joe??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both pairs use upside-down count & attitude|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: they may well do, but was this really the auction?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|swanson: This is one of those hand where you want to get the king of the dangerous suit on opening lead - tough to develope a system for that.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Horrible as defender to see that spade combination in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have all been there|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems a normal line to win and play a club to the ace and another|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: declarer long pause|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer is not certain how to avoid losing a trick in each suit plus a ruff.  If he plays trumps early his only certain entry to dummy is gone.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: certainly not playing too quickly at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: random guess   4@D=denial cue   slam interest but NO @D card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|harmon: hard to recover from 2n|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: natural auction works better here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the treatment does seem to eat up a lot of space when holding only 3-fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4@D showed 4 clubs and a certain number of key cards -- not sure of the definition of key card here|pg||
nt|harmon: then 6s was a lazy bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: that sounds like a system that might have got them to the grand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: baldurssons pad said "SCRAMBLING" for 2NT, jonssons said 4-3 or 44 minors|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: baldursson reading CC and asking when fantoni would open 2@H|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: nunes lets baldurrson see his hand!|pg||

nt|brolucius: It is not natural to bid the four-card hearts first on a strong hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: "I thought you had 4-2 in clubs not 5-2"|pg||
nt|iceking: ok good point|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fantoni will claim that he would not have revoked if the bidding had been explained properly.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Neat hand. Diamonds are frozen for the defence|pg||

nt|ahollan1: south never bid in the other room   but i doubt that affects the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer must be careful to preserve transportation to pull 4th round of trump without having winning @D ruffed|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: some who play REAL Multi, include the old Roman 2@D [strong 3-suiter]  but otherwise  good 4441 tough in standard|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe those mighty heart spots came to the rescue|pg||
nt|dburn: ...oh, OK - he did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: um @D|pg||
nt|ritong: justin will lead a @c, he just checks auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: uneven tempo here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yep|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: this looks good for Strul - 3NT not certain to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction provided to confirm that things really have changed since  2007 Convention Card |pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table West was able to double a conventional 3@s bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: HH had a great set|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: here, I suppose he can double a conventional 1@s bid if that's in his repertoire|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: THIRD SEAT 1@c MIGHT HAVE WORKED WONDERS|pg||
nt|ybob: now if 2@C Drury fit, S can X|pg||
nt|peachy: Sorry, Caps, oops|pg||
nt|ybob: i like 1@C from S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nunes opened North a systemic 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: they probably have a general agreement that doubling an artificial bid shows the suit|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer can still succeed by going up with the queen on a spade lead to a top honor and a low spade back|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: no way 4@H +1|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2N|nt|iceking: yes so it was 4@S +1|pg||
nt|iceking: Nunes would never pass 4@H there |pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: Not after a raise, with a void heart.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's 3@H suggests a normal single raise. He would bid one of the minors (usually 3@D) with a sound heart raise.|pg||
nt|iceking: Fantoni will i think bid 4@C here |pg||
mb|d!|nt|iceking: looks at least normal 2 me|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: impossible because west has not more than 13 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: yes john|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: P-P-1@H-2N//  some form of unusual vs unusual?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ritong: awkward hand for hemant|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: what he did might work pretty well|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just 3@H competitive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or ..... PASS  nope didn't really think about that one|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ybob: hard bid to W  now, pass or X ?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: though surely one of his opponents will bid soon...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Multon's hand really does have great defense rather than offense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: good|pg||
nt|ybob: now 5@D|pg||
nt|peachy: Kib asked what if they didn't bid game after 2C is doubled?  The loss would be negligible 1 imp of they stayed un partscore while 4S making on any other lead would have been big|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: ...or maybe they won't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 2@D opener is Precision [3-suit short @D] so this is only way to show weak 2  --  unlike NS who use 2@D for really weak and 2@H/@S as constructive|pg||
nt|ritong: nice pot stealing|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Duboin did not necessarily have @C for 2@C -- could have been some strong hands|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
