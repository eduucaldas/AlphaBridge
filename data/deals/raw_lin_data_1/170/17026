nt|sybarra: hello Stephen and all |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ayrshirebridge.co.uk/|pg||
nt|toobad: another|pg||
nt|dburn: London buses, these - you wait all day for a slam, then three come along at once|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a bit of a 5 or 7 deal on a @s lead|pg||
nt|mamos: mmmmm|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but in six you might cash two clubs and play hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  except the doubleton @dQ may come to the rescue|pg||
nt|dburn: perecentages not at all easy to calculate|pg||
nt|mamos: have you got an envelope handy David?|pg||
nt|dburn: though certainly you should not neglect the extra chance in diamonds, so not a "true" five or seven hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  must have got the clubs wrong at the other table|pg||
nt|toobad: You seem to have drawn the short straw with your connection Stephen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mamos: hi all|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: back to spelling classes...|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks for catching up|pg||
nt|dburn: not surprising, perhaps, in view of weak 2@s opening by South|pg||
nt|toobad: the thing to do, if you are only in 5!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  midly surprised that East did not add on a point for the 10-9 of @h |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  for results|pg||
nt|idc: Stephen is our operator, network troubleshooter & parttime commentator|pg||
nt|idc: a man of many talents|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: mmm...|pg||
nt|idc: I see East rather panicked in 3NT last hand, played @d from hand and went one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: play lost in connection error|pg||
nt|mamos: 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|toobad: a quiet pass by west|pg||
nt|mamos: EW seem to have been too passive here|pg||
nt|sybarra: West not a fun hand to lead from |pg||
nt|mamos: and are maybe a bit lucky that game is not making their way|pg||
nt|toobad: d would be good, but prob AS|pg||
nt|mamos: as it happens West  cannot do much harm |pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: W will be endplayed a lot on this hand|pg||
nt|toobad: great start for defence|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|dburn: still, no one will bid a slam now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a poor contract|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it does have the merit of nine on top|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: well...it does have 9 top tricks :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  unfortunate :(|pg||

nt|idc: Hard to see this one not being flat as well|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round there will be a long break for dinner. Restart at 20.00 local time, in about 3 hours and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have a lot of high cards but poor shape and two top @d losers|pg||
nt|mamos: bet you didnt expect @d9 to win last trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability is going to make this board less interesting than it might|pg||
nt|dburn: one thing about these players - they have a refreshing attitude towards getting on with the game|pg||
nt|idc: v 4@h North needs to switch to @d at trick 2, continued @c in OR and declarer had 10|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - we should be finished in time to watch the highlights of the 1st world cup game|pg||
nt|toobad: no time penalties!|pg||
nt|toobad: lightening play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does other room result look right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|toobad: sounds good Guthi|pg||
nt|idc: A point of technique on this hand:|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT agrees spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks goofy |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|idc: in 4@s on say trump or @h or @c lead: draw trump, eliminate side suits finishing in dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  card also says that 2NT shows slam interest - maybe West thought he was not good enough |pg||
nt|idc: then a @d to Q and claim - South endplayed even if they began with AK @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  true - but most of the time South has dxA-K he will lead one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dA-K|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: seems to think he has now :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|idc: Of course, they might have led one from @dAK, but no reason not to play it properly :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Do not understand this bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|toobad: n might pass this, nope|pg||
nt|mamos: oh its the terrorist 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North will need to switch to a @d at trick two to stop the overtrick|pg||
nt|idc: spotlight on North then...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  results |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: Many players go through this stage in their bridge careers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is hoping for a 6th @s but optimistic even then|pg||
nt|idc: Lose patience on potential slam hand and use Blackwood |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West should have responded 2NT and so not felt the need to take control later|pg||
nt|dburn: chance for Northern Ireland - right defence not all that far-fetched|pg||
nt|sybarra: lebs |pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: Yes, the 2@c bid left them stuck a little over 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: West is worth no more than a "sound raise " to 4@S  some pairs play 3NT shows this sort of hand as  response to 1M|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: declarer not looking too aghast...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: not overtrick - for the contract|pg||
nt|dburn: and it might even stop the contract|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mamos: Jones's 2@C shows a weak hand without Clubs |pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: i think they said it was minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and includes one major?|pg||
nt|mamos: or with Clubs or something|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  three rounds of clubs at other table too|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about that @c8 - seemed to be a half-way house between shwoing count and discouraging|pg||
nt|dburn: but a more usual attitude @c5 might have got the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  foul @d split here|pg||
nt|idc: if playing attitude perhaps she thought @cT might have suit preference overtones|pg||
nt|idc: sorry, meant reverse attitude|pg||
nt|dburn: if playing attitude, your cards do not have "suit preference overtones" - this isn't Humpty Dumpty bridge|pg||
nt|idc: just discouraging with 5 clearly best if normal attitude|pg||
nt|idc: it is if I say it is!|pg||
nt|toobad: Scotland on a roll|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: OK ...Let's hope connection holds up a little now :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  East was probably wondering whether West is showing a hand too good to open 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks Stephen - a slight overbid then if GF|pg||
nt|idc: In the other room, SOuth led @s2 v 3NT, and North put in @s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only 8 tricks in view (and that is with @h 3-3)|pg||
nt|idc: so the 10 won trick one|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: Any thoughts on North's dbl?   I quite like it opposite a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the right shape certianly|pg||
nt|dburn: don't mind it at these colours, but might tip declarer to a line he would not otherwise find|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|dburn: still, it's a bidders' game, and North-South certainly play it that way|pg||
nt|mamos: might misplace @SK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: The English EW  are both experienced and perhaps less "excitable" than many JUniors  Id expect a reasonably steady performance from them|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes = declarer needs to duck the 1st @s really|pg||
pc|c4|nt|toobad: should be 2 off |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: could very well do|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South dozing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: Robertson may make this   but even 1 off will be a couple of imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  double dummy I can see how to make it: knock out the @hA, cash @h/@c winners and exit with 3rd @d|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - declarer wasn't going to run the four, although he would have made some kind of history if he had|pg||
pc|d6|nt|idc: A guess declarer may be able to put pressure on North, who is holding most of the defensive values|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is leading twice towards the hearts in case North has A-x|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: close to making but 1 off seems right |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to duck a spade to North to keep an entry|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|toobad: if he runs 10c he will make it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: still, maybe he should have done - four diamonds, three hearts, one of each black suit...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|idc: All eggs in 3-3 @c split basket, not that I can blame West for that|pg||
nt|idc: hmm, North should have covered that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would have been better to play second heart here|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but he needed more time and more entries than he had to set those up|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|mamos: this will work|pg||

pc|c3|pc|h6|nt|toobad: bingo|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: and very pretty - well done West (if he does it)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  N needed to play more quickly here|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a kind of three-suit strip squeeze without the count|pg||
nt|idc: yes, when you are going to be under pressure best to plan early so you can make crucial discard smoothly|pg||
nt|dburn: and one of these days, I expect to see a full discussion of the topic by Julian Pottage|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  mind you - once South turns up with the @sK North's shape becomes pretty well marked|pg||

nt|mamos: eleven :)|pg||
nt|mamos: ive goy about 5 tricks thats half way and partner has 15 +  |pg||
nt|mamos: wow the hand shave been enormous in this set|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@h looks rather better than 6NT|pg||
nt|dburn: seems odd that the score should be only 7-3 - these boards have had the potential for it to be 47-43|pg||
nt|fifee: hi John|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike Amos, left us to carve the sunday dinner (left us no menu) |pg||

nt|skorchev: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: some difference in the speed of this and the Camrose|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  mind you - 12 on top in both thanks to the @dJ|pg||
nt|vbman: yes it must be an end of a period of time so they are even tired maybe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: wont take long to complete the round|pg||
nt|idc: 2@s seems normal, and down one certainly likely if not two|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 1@s 1@h 2@d 2@c to lose|pg||
nt|mamos: Becky not prepared to sell out to 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: s would love to defend s here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  double is presumably a game try|pg||
nt|idc: I like to play that as a game-try dbl, I do hope N-S don't|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: not alerted but presumably a game try|pg||
nt|dburn: why - can they beat three hearts?|pg||
nt|mamos: i was wondering if it was alerted but remembered that its EBL regs|pg||
nt|skorchev: yeah, furthermore all teams are 4-handed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: why does s not push vul opps|pg||
mb|2N|nt|toobad: s should be bidding 3c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he knows n is almost certainly void in s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Stephen Peterkin, welcome to you too|pg||
nt|vbman: what about that 2sp anyone?|pg||
nt|skorchev: too aggressive :)|pg||
nt|vbman: but shuts the h suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: come to that, can they beat four hearts?|pg||
nt|idc: Take your point David but I was worrying that any pair who think South has a game try|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: no doubles alertable in Scotland...|pg||
nt|idc: may also think North has an accept :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not "on top" - suppose East led his singleton spade against 6@h|pg||
nt|idc: even the 3rd best slam, 6@s, should be ok|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the best contract is six hearts by South, but that might be a bit difficult to organise|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  @h lead best as cards lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but West may score a @c ruff to make up the club trick lost on the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: @CQ   is an interesting lead|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the -2 in OR came when South didn't have trump control to set up a long club trick|pg||
nt|dburn: he may, but this lead may also have lost a tempo - declarer would have problems keeping control on a heart lead|pg||
nt|mamos: (is fearless the code?)|pg||
nt|idc: whereas this lead should give him that, so perhaps -2 for a flat board|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a likely push |pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: i wd ask her if she overcalled for the single h|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: just pesky that spades are 4/1|pg||
nt|toobad: not under enough pressure in 2... 3 would have been more interesting|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: @cQ would have worked better|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: make a lot of tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: played by North, this might be closer to a five or seven deal than the previous candidate|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that West did not double 5@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is trying to work out whether 6@c shows no kings or the @cK?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: good catch - I suspect that he was asleep (understandably given the hour)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 5NT asks for Kings  odd time for \south to be thinking|pg||
nt|toobad: i think they are all just v tired|pg||
nt|toobad: 7 now!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  given how quickly they play, it would have been possible to arrange the schedule for an earlier finish |pg||
nt|dburn: seven? if North believes South's bidding, she should bid at least eight|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: and ew will almost certainly bid 3d|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamonds plays well for East  -- and a heck of a lot better thaN @s|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: not ridiculous to try for game with the South cards - those kings look well placed (though one of them isn't)|pg||
nt|toobad: wow|pg||
nt|mamos: it is exhausting watching Junior bridge emotions fluctuate wildly  brilliance turns to idiocy and then back again in a twinkling  |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  anyone who has been following the snooker, it is heading for a last frame decider between Selby and Maguire - not that we want to stop you from watching here :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|mamos: THOUGH THIS IS NOT SO GOOD|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East did well to read the lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: East could just have tried to cash top cards because North had to ruff with winners|pg||
nt|toobad: good to see Richard thinking about best defence|pg||
nt|idc: except for 'brilliance' you could be talking about any of my games|pg||
nt|vbman: akd, k, d maybe thinking cl king is on|pg||
nt|skorchev: she was doubleton @H|pg||
nt|vbman: by the way 3h looks cold to me|pg||
nt|vbman: oh true|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|idc: Well, no UCB 2@d by partner, so it is a little pushy|pg||
nt|dburn: facing three trumps to the queen and clubs headed by A10 or K10, game would have reasonable play|pg||
nt|dburn: so trying for game is only mildly fearless|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  considering what some people overcall on non-vul these days South was hugely better than he might be|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: though in fact trump was best|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: perhaps need to be a bit careful |pg||

nt|idc: Interesting auction by East in OR|pg||
nt|idc: If you have a penalty dbl of 3NT, I think you also have one of 4@c|pg||
nt|mamos: in a way the result does suggest that South was hopelessly over optimistic|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 26 HCP EW figure to reach game|pg||

nt|mamos: 3NT?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  with the hearts blocked, it looks like declarer can even afford a diamond loser|pg||
nt|idc: I like that: both sides wanted to play in 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North-South had been allowed to play 3NT, they would on best defence have achieved an above-par result of minus 600|pg||
nt|dburn: good bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 5@h 2@c 2@d|pg||
nt|skorchev: it's a good game because there is no duplication in @S|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: yes if the double showed Diamonds quite surprising not to try a little push|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|yorkbeach:  let S know that a @c return is futile|pg||

pc|dT|nt|dburn: nah - no match would ever get beyond the second board|pg||

nt|dburn: I suppose you could implement a system like they have in tennis - three undos per set|pg||
nt|vbman: the great shuffler is at work|pg||
mb|1H|nt|toobad: slam not easy on a h lead|pg||
nt|dburn: rather less bidding than one might expect at the other table|pg||
nt|sybarra: little imps as we say |pg||
nt|sybarra: but it could well matter|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mamos: i wonder if declarer thought about those little Hearts  5 was lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed but good fun to play|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wales did well there|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont agree with either of those two calls|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed they did, and who knows - playing penalty doubles of 1@h might work well for them here also|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  not a fan of canape openings either |pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: explained as Jump fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 1NT or pass are reasonable for East but not double|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: there is going to be a break after this one .. |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|toobad: Scotland are doing the business so far|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|jcomyn: dont agree with x|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what will s do if n bids 3h|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont mind canape openings in some situations but thats a really good six card suit and a hopeless five card one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this has no chance|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 4@H is  /&%¤ !!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 5@H is ............................|pg||
nt|dburn: no doubt North thought South's 3@d implied a heart fit|pg||
nt|dburn: and still thinks so|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: got a little out of control....|pg||
nt|dburn: Robson and Segal's book ought not to be allowed to be read by people under 25|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East might find a double here but is trying to avoid doing with with undue haste|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: N thinks jump fit...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: 2 @C was stretching my imagination  (even with the new systems)|pg||
nt|toobad: We might be in for a tense finish............. always a good thing|pg||
mb|5D|nt|idc: tennis is a dangerous game for bridge to ape: Brits never win anything|pg||
nt|sybarra: BBO seems to specialize in those |pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|idc: As long as East started with two ir more red cards in her box .. phew|pg||
nt|dburn: and not very many people over it, either|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mamos: East probably checking the colour of the backs of her cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  not very sincere 'thank you partner'|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: they never win anything at bridge either - I don't see the problem|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: NS not on same wavelnght here  South should rebid 3NT?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|toobad: s has one of those 14 counts where u have to pass.......... not easy for a junior......... and a lot of seniors i know too|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|idc: Does someone want to mention Burn's Law here?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: USA Neth. finals (Venice Cup)  USA finals in World cup to name a few |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I suppose South does have a sort of fit jump - he has 4-4 in the red suits; the trouble is that both red suits are diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|nt|idc: indeed|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: u most certainly do and i agree a lot of senior players x|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: well, 2NT if that were forcing, as it probably should be|pg||
nt|toobad: v well played|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: the we didnt come herer to pass brikgade|pg||
nt|toobad: or they bid a filthy 2c lol|pg||
nt|mamos: I do think double is completely wrong  - Pass is fine  - even 2@C  but double will shows 4 Hearts in my (humble!!) opinion  and more Diamonds and just asks for trouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is heading to a nasty score for ireland|pg||
nt|mamos: I bet  NOrth wishes hed bid the filthy 2@C  then he'd be playing it rather than North in a filthy 3@d|pg||
nt|toobad: as the cards ly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i couldnt agree more about a x of spades. it MUST show hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: and Pass would have left East playing an uncomfortable 1@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 24-6 with a board to go|pg||
