nt|Vugraphzfd: opening and closing his hand is Bas|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: He is now doing the thinking man pose|pg||
nt|athene: if you bid 5@S now is that only asking for a heart control|pg||
nt|athene: or is it just a general invitation?|pg||
nt|athene: partner could have a pretty respectable double and you could still be off a spade trick and the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: not easy|pg||
nt|athene: this is why i think it's good to open 4 of a major more often than most people do|pg||

nt|athene: so it will be hard to turn this one down|pg||
nt|athene: since those are the two things that 5@S usually asks for|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand south hasn't got anything else |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Fleisher also ducked @HA  but Kamil kept his @H  so expect Hamman to go down on  3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: on the run of the @D, katz bared @HA. then when weinstein played @H up, nickell rose K|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: but i think NS might go here to 4@S|pg||

pc|h7|nt|athene: north will try and play it in 3nt|pg||

pc|s4|nt|jaapfr: my fears were right or Debbie is teasing us all:)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, South was wise to override an attempt to play in four diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: 2N did NOT promise 4@H|pg||
nt|algraves: that is the first time today in the entire world has asked if there were Gazilii implications for anything much less 2@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: denies a 16+ hand here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|athene: this will be ok though|pg||
nt|athene: with the @S9 coming down?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I would never tease|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia asking ????|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect many would PASS 1N with Ralph Katz's hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: katz made this wishy-washy gesture over his 2C to suggest it might not include a major|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: this will be tick, so 1 imp to level the match|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would you bid 3nt with all these Aces as N or @S?|pg||
nt|athene: well as north i would want to play 3n, with the trick source|pg||
nt|athene: but as south i would want to play in spades because i don't think partner will have tricks without the spades|pg||
nt|dburn: if I knew partner had the jack of clubs, I would prefer to play in 3NT|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to gavin wolpert|pg||
nt|gavin:  hey|pg||
nt|gavin:  its times like this that its wonderfull the vanderbilt runs so late|pg||
nt|athene: it's a bit fiddly how you play this  - west has a lot of tempi with that trump holding|pg||
nt|gavin:  finished playing the pair game and still get to watch 12 hands in a close match|pg||
nt|athene: he can plod away at a long-term strategy like cutting your communications with dummy for instance|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@C 12-14 or 18-20 with 2+@C or 4@C with > 12 hcp bid NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 12-14 and 18-20 balanced|pg||

pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: NS lead vs NT = ATTITUDE |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nickell chides weinstein for having the Jacks over his tens; weinstein laughs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: carding reverse Attitude, standard Count  Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein fidgeting with played tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: with many billions of opportunities|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: if they play the Polish way, then not only was 2NT 18-20, it also denied three spades|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|hedyg: 1st gazzilli i see today|pg||
nt|hedyg: did i miss any?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: if not playing gazilli E might be too strong to pass - but not strong enough for 3H to make|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|hT|nt|athene: i don't think they play 1@C - 1@S; 2@D the way the poles would|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: 1@C is more natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smith Echo [some play reverse Smith]  is a way for each partner to say whether happy about the opening lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: HA pulled and put back|pg||
nt|algraves: So Gazilli is the popular european treatment where a bid , say 2@C is dual purpose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: curtis not always showing me his cards - might get one wrong sooner or later|pg||
nt|algraves: either natural or strong and artificial, forcing one round obviously|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: plays them vertically facing the table|pg||
nt|algraves: so since 2@c would have been Gazilli, then 2@H is limited|pg||
nt|algraves: like a big club system|pg||

mb|3C|nt|jaapfr: but 4@S with @S 3-3 likely makes|pg||
nt|athene: yes i wonder how the play went|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2N will show @d but ... 7-carder|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: 3nt doesn't look much fun on a heart lead|pg||
nt|gavin:  I've seen meck do that a lot.  Open a weak 2 bid and then lead a different suit|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess it went something like non-heart lead - calim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher-Kamil play transfers over 1@C -- that's why Fleisher bid 1@S|pg||

nt|athene: not a coded lead|pg||

nt|gavin:  his first decision is whether to duck or win the spade|pg||
nt|dinos1: good X|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: with the club finesse into south you would win, if that were the only consideration|pg||
nt|athene: but the missing @HA makes it a bit harder|pg||
nt|algraves: to the well once more, this can go down a lot with best defdense|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gavin:  if he thinks his right hand opponent will regain the lead, then he cannot afford to win the ace of spades|pg||
nt|gavin:  as he expects the queen of spades to be with south|pg||
nt|gavin:  when north gets in (and south holds the queen) they could play a spade through his jack|pg||
nt|gavin:  by ducking the spade, he takes away that chance|pg||
nt|athene: north might be considering @H10 shift? play his pd for a miracle @HKxx?|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: if declarer knows the match is this tight he might consider playing for overtricks where it isn't totally safe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bob asking questions|pg||
nt|athene: assuming you get the diamonds right you can just cash out for 9|pg||
nt|gavin:  the @S8 could be from Q8 , he is not sure that the aq are onside|pg||
nt|gavin:  or a8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: might take the ""wrong"" @D finesse to protect @SK|pg||
nt|athene: playing on the majors might see east win the @HA and west win a lot of spades|pg||
nt|athene: sure it's not likely that west has all the spades|pg||
nt|athene: but in "normal" circumstances playing imps you just don't take these chances|pg||
nt|gavin:  his first order of business|pg||
nt|gavin:  is to figure out who is likely to be longer in diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|gavin:  I think he is taking his time to see if theres some information available to him that can help|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: when the bridge stalls my fingers get bored, have to type something :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: "safety" finessing diamonds to keep east off lead to protect the @SKx isn't safe, though, is it?|pg||
nt|gavin:  and perhaps he felt like losing to west queen of diamonds was better than east|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well he has gone for that anyway|pg||
nt|jaapfr: luckily @HA not wrong place but for declarer this hand a nightmere|pg||
nt|athene: but if you lose to west's @DQ you might still go down if the cards lie badly e.g. heart to east's ace and a spade through|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: katz takes a deep breath|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: seems strange to win quickly with Ace and THEN pause|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nickell: in the middle of the hand, attitude|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: trying to assess if @S5 gives count implication|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and whether to hold up to prevent a ruff|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in the other match  thru 7    Cayne 15  v  Grue 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin and weinstein going to smoke - nickell declines to accompany them, so they look for a chaperone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we're on break -- do you want me to ramble about anything or should i break too?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many would pay to keep me quiet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: in the vugraph matches especially players are not supposed to leave the table unescorted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: so they cannot get unauthorized information about the score or future boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nickell and katz recruited me to accompany them while they went for coffee|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia is wondering around the room -- Brink tells him to come back and play  -- some laughter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 of 9 boards pushed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: at trick 2, nickell asked weinstein if it was a smith situation and whether H3 was count or attitude.  weinstein said: "if you let us tell we'll never screw it up"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: grue: what were your diamonds? cheek: queen and one. grue: so you took 4 - 8 - 9?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very difficult . probably 8 @S for 7, after 4 and after need to guess ...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dinos1: 8 will be wrong if E had stiff 7 left|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rather sound 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Kamil did NOT open East hand|pg||

mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein looking down with the bill of his cap pulled over his forehead - as usual|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: NS might get themselves doubled if they bid too many hearts here|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps hard for EW to double without trump tricks|pg||
nt|gavin:  Its very important with souths hand to pass here|pg||
nt|gavin:  since you only have 4 points, either west or north has a strong hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  if you freely bid 3@H here, even when you are correct, your partner will take you too seriously|pg||

pc|d4|nt|dburn: may be disappointed that Bob couldn't bid three again|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ányway 4@C spot on|pg||
nt|gavin:  with good diamonds drijver decided to lead passively , not fearing the major suit losers dissappearing|pg||
nt|athene: do you have to ruff the @SQ down for a heart pitch?|pg||
nt|athene: or is there something better?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, spot on with this lead - not so spot on if North had chanced to lead a heart|pg||
nt|gavin:  drijver expects dummy to hit with weakness in both majors|pg||
nt|gavin:  since east could have bid 3@H or 3@S in an effort to reach 3NT|pg||
nt|gavin:  he was unaware which major was zia's problem for 3NT|pg||
nt|gavin:  so he elects not to gamble |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: like everyone else -- I wonder what else Nick needed to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nickell pulled SA first but put it back - don't know what their agreements are here|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - I didn't expect him to lead a heart, or anything but a club|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: Joe did announce 2@D was Game Force|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: here weinstein confirmed it with nickell at the end of the auction|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if it was spades, though, that would give south @SAK, so maybe hearts is the % weak spot|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: if you assume EW do have one major totally wide open|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree leading a heart can just give the contract so many times, a trump looked normal|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d on the 4-3 fit was good enough for 4 IMPs to Nickell|pg||
nt|athene: are there any sort of extra board things if the match is very close?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down in @H??|pg||
nt|dburn: when Wold and Bates tried 3NT, down, rather than 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: or is 1 imp a win?|pg||
nt|dburn: one is enough|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, 0.1 is enough if the Director imposes some adjustment or other|pg||
nt|athene: zia going for the psychological line|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told 7 extra boards if a tie|pg||
nt|dburn: he's not doing anything psychological particularly - maybe he can endplay North|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if N sees pd with @HK (no 3nt bis W) he plays x@H for @D switch i think|pg||
nt|dburn: "psychological" would be a low spade to the jack|pg||
nt|athene: well he did have the option of ruffing a spade to drop the queen|pg||
nt|dburn: he still does|pg||
nt|athene: and then throwing a heart from dummy on his @S10|pg||
nt|athene: yes but now he has let the defence cash two hearts|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a spec says S had to play @HK direct based on the same reasoning ( W not 3nt)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of thinking sigh by Bas|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he keeps playing with card|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@s is makeable only dbl-dummy - dbl @c fin|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfd: katz trying to muddle the position|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so i think that is the worry of N|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if my pd had @HK why he did not play it direct|pg||
nt|athene: i still think there was an element of psychology in the way zia played this|pg||
nt|athene: he was just relying on the fact that south would not take his honour|pg||
nt|athene: and he was known to have the king probably from the opening lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okay lost the play they did it so fast now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gavin:  4@C making or not will be a loss for the Nickell team|pg||
nt|nkgupt: if the @sq was comming 3rd he was always cold...now playing ak@s and letting N hold @sq discarding a @d|pg||
nt|gavin:  ew have bid 3NT and got a diamond lead from the king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: making there was an easier way to do this says Zia and now all are laughing|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfd: duboin frequently pulls cards uncalled and when sementa led @H2 from hand and called A, duboin pulled the J|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfd: discussing 5@D, weinstein: "depends how I defend it"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia in 6@C   fast/furious auction   1@C-2@C-5@C-5@S//6@C|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: in college we talked about writing a book  "What's Going On?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein whispers softly : undiscussed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: it came from auction that started    1@C-2@C-3@C-5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: then levin alerts 4C when the tray comes through|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: the answer --  4th hand misheard [pre bid boxes] opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@H or 5@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose PASS is still possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs who play (1@C)-2@D as Michaels  have a 2nd bid to show STRONG Michaels vs 2@D as weak version|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT could be a lot weaker|pg||
nt|hedyg: could just be limit raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sementa wants to make a move, grabbed a bid but didn't pull one|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 3 card fit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gavin:  king of clubs lead will be best against 1@S X|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Drijver out for blood|pg||
nt|dburn: may spill some, too|pg||
nt|athene: need 3 down; must have game on|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but will they bid 3nt here?|pg||
nt|gavin:  looks doable, north is entitled to 3 natural trump tricks, plus one heart ruff |pg||
nt|ahollan1: there goes last hand pickup of 9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin winces, says "thanks", groans|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|gavin:  (they can get hte heart ruff by discarding a heart on the 3rd round of clubs)|pg||
nt|athene: three small in opener's suit proves a bad holding for the overcaller once again|pg||
nt|dburn: will Meckwell bid 3NT? is the Pope a Catholic?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: may be yes:)|pg||
nt|gavin:  however they must play a diamond through before taking the heart ruff, as declarer would use the 13th heart to pitch a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  compressing the diamond loser with one of the trump losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: as reply to yr 2nd question:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: meckwell will open south 1@D not 1@C of course, which makes the penalty pass fractionally less appealing, maybe?|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing Q@S with the extra @s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sementa says possibly 3 spades|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: since north has more length in the bid suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia asking discards|pg||
nt|gavin:  south's club was suit preference for diamonds i imagine|pg||
nt|gavin:  since south knew that north was leading from shortness|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|gavin:  and north knew that south knew because declarer ducked (therefore south has the queen)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway a new leader expected after this board|pg||
nt|gavin:  so i expect a diamond from drijver |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d7|nt|gavin:  and the rest plays itself, an easy discard of a heart for north on the club|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gavin:  or not so|pg||
nt|athene: this will work too; north just has to avoid getting endplayed, and south still has an entry with the heart, so there is no problem|pg||
nt|dburn: he can discard anything - as long as he doesn't pitch a trump, he should be OK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: but not now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: they do anything you ask (roughly same age as NS Gavin:)? |pg||
nt|gavin:  now overtake in dummy and lead a heart ?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence just had to make use of south being on lead, and playing another diamond wasn't really doing that|pg||
nt|athene: i think south expected that north would have a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha they failed here once to listen (at least Bas did)|pg||
nt|athene: and hence would be ruffing this trick|pg||
nt|athene: since north shifted to a BIG diamond from three small|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|d6|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: eyes darting back and forth across the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: squeeze is so much more pleasurable than a simple finesse|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: leading high from three small is just bad because partner gets the count wrong|pg||
nt|athene: well in my experience this happens a lot|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: grue whispers to sementa and shows him his hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: lead @h and see if N splits honors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: duboin shakes his head again - guess sementa craning over didn't give it away|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: a kibitzer suggests north could have tried MUD in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. lead middle card to try to deny an honour but then follow with the higher one to deny a doubleton|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y would work fine then |pg||
nt|athene: i prefer just lead low from three to say you have three|pg||
nt|athene: but of course it all depends on circumstances|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia asks if he has 4 tricks and Bob says yes and laughter and then says really only 3  I can't make more says Zia|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia talking to himself and claiming|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 21 count and 5-3 fit, that is going some|pg||
mb|1C!|an|strong|nt|dburn: indeed they did - could be rather important, that one spade doubled|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jaapfr: it remains extremely tight with 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein:"it's hard to do" and that he didn't want to give away the club situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: there's no redress for incorrect acceptance of claim even after the board is over is there?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  i expect a 2@S bid by zia|pg||

nt|imp_jan: rdbl = 3@h|pg||
nt|gavin:  i think he will not sell out to 2@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3S just competitive - X would be game try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nickell sitting so cockeyed levin would be looking into his hand if not for the screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: please specs stop asking me how he made 4@HX, we do not know|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: joe/curtis discussing how much 1NT there would show|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: quick inaudible discussion before katz picks up his bids|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the play in 4HX went very fast, fastre than I could follow or write down - was meanwhile struggling to get the connection back up|pg||
nt|hedyg: np John ! not your fault|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: it was not even obvious that it had made when he claimed but joe said he thought hed made it and everyone wrote 790|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gavin:  this looks to be a pretty good spot, typically 4-3 fits are worse when the opponents can force you to ruff with your 4 card suit|pg||
nt|athene: NS should know this is a 4-3 fit because with four spades zia would have bid them first time|pg||
nt|gavin:  here it doesnt cause much concern with trumps breaking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: grue takes a walk|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: getting forced in the long trump holding is only bad if you really fear losing trump control|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i still believe that with the last 4 tricks left W played @S and N returned @S (easier to believe 1 player did something wrong then that 3 players were wrong about the claim)|pg||
nt|athene: and that is only bad if you have some big side suit you need to cash|pg||
nt|jaapfr: b59|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia says solid and then thank you and lead in partners suit is ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they all agreed to claim|pg||
nt|athene: often at a low level you can just go with it if they force you, and scramble a healthy number of tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gavin:  these guys have a lot of experience playing in 4-3 fits, two of the best in the game at it|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Hamman's 3@S actually made it easier for EW to compete to 5@H|pg||

pc|d4|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|hedyg: last 2 boards of this segment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sementa muttering in italian after his @DJ got hooked|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: another colorful board|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: 2@H-1 i guess?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|hedyg: segments 3 and 4 in 2 and half hours|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4H two-way opposite limited 1H. could be game values or preemptive|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: will zia try another 3-card major bid here?|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@H might have been beaten on a black-suit lead, but Wold reasonably chose a diamond|pg||
mb|d!|nt|athene: or will he bid an honest notrump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Good point Al, which reminds me of board 11, where the jump to 5@C pushed opps into bidding at 5 level|pg||
nt|debrose: while in this room jumping only to 4@C ended with buying the hand in 5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: katz writes levin a note in tiny letters then quickly scratches it out|pg||
mb|5H|nt|debrose: certainly some randomness there, but I've observed that bidding more to "make the opponents guess" does fairly often have this effect|pg||
nt|dinos1: XX now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: X asks joe to pull with the preemptive hand and pass with the value hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: no reaction from W with 2 aces?|pg||
nt|dinos1: what wd be XX by Duboin?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sementa grabs a bid, releases it, whispers something to grue|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: you'd have to ask duboin|pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: ok, he doesn't have to decide|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 1@D = 0-6 hcp|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oeff 2@H AND 2@S made at 62|pg||
nt|athene: and west finessed against dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: cheek cocks his head at the 5@S bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|6D|nt|ahollan1: 3@C much safer spot but @H layout means Weinstein choice of 1N is safe|pg||
nt|debrose: However, on board 14, I believe Hamman's 3@S overcall might have been systemicly showing that sort of hand, rather than a wildly strong preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS published range is   good 14-17|pg||
nt|debrose: 3@C was an interesting spot - not exactly safe, since could lose two diamonds, and a trick in each of the other suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: other tables in this room have finished - we still have one board to go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm with you Debbie   i think 14 was result of very tiny differences yielding significant differences|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: red vs white sac? or twoway?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|dburn: that gave Meckstroth a tempo, and his eighth trick before the defenders could get six|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  NOBODY can stop in 2@C :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: not likely to lose 7 imps here|pg||
nt|athene: it wouldn't matter anyway with a spade going away|pg||
nt|dburn: I think 14 was the result of Fleisher bidding 2@h then 5@h - the sort of thing that produces a swing, but not always in your column|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: joe: OK! some hand!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|debrose: sorry for typos, on a laptop I'm not used to.  I think Kamil believe declarer might have a singleton diamond, in which case a trump shift could prove effective|pg||
nt|dburn: possible, but he can be fairly sure East is 4-4 in the red suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: oops sorry, typoed D2 for S2|pg||
nt|dinos1: 500 vs 920|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: "good luck"|pg||
pc|s4|nt|debrose: Especially having made a takeout double, if Kamil had not shift to a trump he would have had a short of scoring his club Q.  He had a tough trick two problem (or trick three if ...|pg||
nt|debrose: he'd cashed a diamond first).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein reviewing EW defense to NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with Nickell showing so much -- is it possible that Weinstein will misguess @C?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: "K is your big lead?" nickell nods. "asks for unblock of an honor except in this situation!" - points to @DTxxx on table|pg||
nt|bigtrain: buckeyes on shortly.... grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr|pg||
nt|dburn: so may not play him for 4=4=4=1 shape|pg||
nt|debrose: and if needing to ruff diamonds in hand, declarer was likely not be able to ever afford club finesse into his Q|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|dburn: well, you might want to watch the last board in this one first|pg||
nt|gavin:  we had a nice discussion on our site which lead to the following article about how involved vugraph commentators should be in the accuracy of results. http://bridgewinners.com/jason-feldman/321-instant-replay  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: knowing both suits -- 2@H & 2@S both available as cue bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so players use similar treatment as Unusual vs Unusual|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin reaches for a bid, pulls back...|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  operators rather|pg||
nt|jaapfr: forgot b64|pg||
nt|debrose: Standard "unusual vs. unusual" is 2@H limit + in clubs and 2@S inv + in diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: whispers inaudible explanation|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty John, you are really an excellent operator|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thank you. and thanks all for joining us.  third quarter in  2 and a half hours|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfd: then weinstein inquires about the pass|pg||
nt|debrose: other treatments for those Q-bids are also possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: will forward any details I am able to glean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: before UvU  people would play 2M=stopper|pg||
nt|debrose: such as stopper showing, but I think very few if any experts play that way these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: In theory the players behind screens are required to write their explanations - ideally largely and clearly for the vugraph operators benefit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hilarious  2N alerted because Natural|pg||
nt|debrose: In practice, the inaudible whispering is all too common|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: don't know which matches we'll have - depends on halftime scores|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|debrose: It looks funny Al, but the reality is behind screens players tend to explain all their bids that might not be totally obvious to their screenmates|pg||
nt|debrose: There is no clear distinction between alertable and not alertable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh i know -- but there is no humor value there|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@h - sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sementa departs|pg||
nt|hedyg: going to smoke|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|debrose: So the operator may be alerting us here, and entering an explanation, as is very helpful, because one was given|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was about to follow-up with     i played convention card where we said 2N is NEVER Natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein: what did you show? nickell: clubs and diamonds, invitational values|pg||

nt|jbennet: to do"|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: just looking at the diamond suit here you should cash the king first as you can pick up 4-0 with west but not east|pg||
