nt|junaid: hi all, welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: welcome from a very hot and sunny karachi:)|pg||
nt|ehsana: both these teams ahve been winners however today it seems data steel is running all ove candyland|pg||
nt|ehsana: thye mean it is their product name :)|pg||
nt|ehsana: Tahir Massood and Jawad is a new partnership|pg||
nt|ady: good day all|pg||
nt|junaid: hello everyone again|pg||
nt|junaid: does this score include the carryover as well|pg||
nt|junaid: and does anyone know how much it was to begin with?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: this includes the carry over|pg||
mb|1N|nt|junaid: and this segment is like the 7th game of tennis set...candyland have to make some inroads, they cant afford to fall too far back|pg||
nt|ehsana: Tehsin plays for Data steel|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|junaid: looks like a misundertanding right off the bat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: to me seems a difficult brd for both teams..anything can happen...declarer will face problems|pg||
nt|ady: west pass?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|junaid: please remember that NS are a first time partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: a pretty light overcall by TM but thats his style and it has worked for him often enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: and his partner should be surprised to find him w/ this hand|pg||
nt|junaid: should NOT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|junaid: works out well|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ehsana: 2Nt may end up in the red :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: plucky balance from east    |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|junaid: S plays namyats, N does not:)|pg||
nt|junaid: but 3NT should make for EW tho it will take play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last segment of 12 boards|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d7|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Udspil fra Jxxx koster altid et stik|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT   but would have to play well on a spade lead|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|Walddk3: Ingen undtagelse her|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|junaid: and i think climbing to 5@d was a consequence of not getting to game earlier|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @C lead would cause problems maybe?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Well that and what I like to call "the preemption effect".. suddenly opponents start stretching just because they feel you're trying to preempt them|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 1@D followed by 3@S as the auction went. was a responder reverse. essentially gf. And south did not have that bid.. If he wanted to compete. I think a Dbl was best. |pg||
pc|hT|pc|d5|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||

nt|junaid: right|pg||

nt|oosmanb: The lead here gave declarer an extra trick, but I think he always had 9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|ebrok: men spar ud er også 9 stik. |pg||
nt|junaid: and a correct @c guess would even allow him to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|junaid: this could turn into an 11imp pickup for sabres|pg||
nt|tipu: this will be an interesting segment as we all expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: North telling E to just enjoy his game and not take any pressure :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: any bets on 4S by East:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tipu: rightly so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Karen Allison|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Surely cant be namyats, if South has AK@H... |pg||
mb|1H|nt|tipu: W is a man likely to get under pressure in these situations|pg||
nt|kareno:  Good morning from cloudy New York City :)|pg||
nt|tipu: Hello Karen|pg||
nt|tipu: but East is as cool as ice:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|oosmanb: But I guess if you agreed on a convention and it comes your way, you trust it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ady: part score hand   e/w 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ehsana: 5D on too|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead should beat it and w/ trump control, TM will likely find the lead and then finding entry in N hand is not a matter of choice, only one option|pg||
nt|ehsana: 5D playable cntrct|pg||
nt|tipu: East Uzair Kamal is responsible for making a lit of good yougsters to excell |pg||
nt|tipu: lot |pg||
nt|Walddk4: West you mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: nothing else makes sense...also, has no one every opened namyats missing the AK of trumps?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oosmanb: No, by definition|pg||
mb|p|nt|tipu: yes West|pg||
nt|tipu: thnk God I mentioned the name Uzair I meant:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yasser Rahim|pg||
nt|yr: hi all|pg||
nt|tipu: welcome Yasir|pg||
nt|yr: a strange looking contract here,, 5@c is more normal|pg||
nt|kareno:  What was the 1@c bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: this should go down on accurate defence|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|ebrok: Det var en rigtig stor pas i øst!?|pg||
nt|junaid: even then, E can bank on @hs for @c pitches after 2 rounds of trumps...interesting play problem|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|oosmanb: However  NS might get lucky, since 4@S nor 5@C makes on the last board, on correct defence|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: should be 10 tricks without spade lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|junaid: no option here but to hook|pg||
nt|ehsana: early pressure :)|pg||
nt|junaid: Qxx in N way less probable|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Miran made the bidding easy by opening 1NT, with his 2452 hand|pg||
mb|1D|mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Preemption working great at this table. So West decides to bid 3@C, why not :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|oosmanb: This is going to be scary for declarer, to say the least|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: If East has A@D he needs to duck this|pg||
nt|oosmanb: if West has it, he must take the first one|pg||
nt|junaid: but he should still make it...scared or not:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He plays the preemptor for no outside Ace|pg||
nt|oosmanb: No sir, he's down now|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Hi|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Yes, what was 1@C|pg||
nt|yr: i really have no idea what wwas 1@c,,maybe a psych|pg||
mb|3D|nt|junaid: true, but unless @s is played by N, there will be no @c lead and then W will have to shift to a @c after a high @d lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jillan:  dom Ã¤r lÃ¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥ngsamma vid andra bordet|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ehsana: For Cricket Lovers...Zimbawi  9 for 2 in 4 overs  against Pakistan |pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzaa: allt är relativt :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: men Troberg-Knutsson är nog bland de långsammare paren i den här tillställningen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: little to make here    2@S  may or may not make|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: and sibanda just hit a 4 off gul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hardly when West bid 2@D|pg||
nt|kareno:  5@c down on diamond ruff assuming north leads that or a heart.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|ehsana: face savings pass of 2D by East|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe they play reversed minor openings?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: apologies for the lack of play on last brd, E/W's hands were dealt the other way round here|pg||
nt|yr: then maybe operator error|pg||
nt|tipu: another unlucky contract|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|oosmanb: I think that's a very reasonable defence, after A@D, dummy is void in @h so no future there, you can see 10@C so pd might even be ruffing the first one|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT certainly will make on that lead|pg||
nt|kareno:  Yes, doomed on the spade lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk3: Brunzell är i 3NT vid andra bordet|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno:  That explains the auction!!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk3: 1 bet snart|pg||
nt|junaid: strange decision from E not to invite, but this might work out quite well|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno:  So are they dealt backwards in the CR also?  or is that a fouled board?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ehsana: nice pass by Kamal..probably 9 tricks for wajahat Suri|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d8|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: n/s have possibilities of a minor suit slam|pg||

nt|tipu: yes right|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: this should be a routine 4@h contract|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT  also look likely to make|pg||
nt|ady: can take 13 tricks on good heart view|pg||
nt|kareno:  can|pg||
nt|tipu: minor slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 4 of either major seems fine|pg||
nt|ehsana: a major game for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 4S will be take n to teh Cleaners |pg||
nt|ady: likely to end in small slam|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ehsana: 4S looks better|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk3: 3NT bästa kontrakt|pg||
pc|s7|nt|junaid: S hand tailor made for walsh, showing 4441 GF|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ehsana: strange double|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: S asked W if 4@h was weak|pg||
pc|c7|nt|junaid: it would've ended up going to the cleaners if EW dbled, but that is not a clear at the table action|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: 3@d inquired about, alerted as natural|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk3: Kommer att gå hem i 4@S också när klövermasken ordnar sig|pg||
nt|jillan:  det hÃ¤r borde gÃ¥ bra ocksÃ¥, eftersom bl a @S J Ã¤r hos Ã¶st|pg||
nt|oosmanb: After that lead.. yes :) declarer must be scared|pg||
nt|yr: here comes the good old 4nt,,,,|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ehsana: my humble opinion 4S bettr than 4H :)|pg||
nt|tipu: yes they did|pg||
nt|tipu: still have to guess the @c right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|junaid: even now they seem to be on their way to 6m...needs luck, but its there, minors breaking and one of the two red hooks on|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT has merit here as 6@D might fail with bad trump split and badly place with 6NT making |pg||
nt|vugraphzar: explained, rather than alerted|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yr: its normal to play some sort of Kickback in minor suit slam auctions but NS here are from the old school|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: 3@h sorry|pg||
nt|kareno:  Pitch on heart|pg||

nt|tipu: thnx for correcting Karen|pg||
pc|h4|nt|junaid: :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ehsana: some systems can expose dual major holdings:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: making this harder by messing up entries for @C ruffs.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|junaid: luckily for dec only one way hook available in @d and that happens to work|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ehsana: In 4S he had almost 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: no way of knowing which 4 is better during auction|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oosmanb: so lets call them both good contracts :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kareno:  Yes, but it's normal to play the spades for queen (at least) on declarer's right.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ehsana: .BUT 4H struggles :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Sabres have picked up 14 imps for board 1|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oosmanb: Seldom contracts that struggle, only declarers :)|pg||

pc|sT|pc|h8|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||

nt|junaid: the defense of 4@s turned out to be harder than we anticipated after looking at all 4 hands...it usually does:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Like Junaid bhai predicted 4@S defence wasnt easy :)|pg||
nt|ehsana: yes nicely played by wajaha|pg||
nt|yr: i think he played too quickly|pg||
nt|tipu: fine contract but unlucky|pg||

nt|yr: he has loads of talent as a declarer|pg||

nt|ady: weak 2  or multi South?|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: not worth it imo|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yr: good try by declarer but he was destined for faliure|pg||
mb|1D|nt|oosmanb: More imps for sabres in brd 14|pg||
nt|ehsana: part game for N/S|pg||
nt|junaid: actually, not even close imo...but declarer might have enough confidence in the defensive discards|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: a typical modern day 3rd seat opener|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ehsana: 200 points in each direction..should be a good tussle to buy the cntrct :)\|pg||

nt|ady: no problems here    might even make 10 tricks as they lay|pg||
mb|2D|nt|oosmanb: :) I was wondering if you multiply your scale by 10 for the fun of it|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Would be interesting,, 150-170 1NT :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Just to confuse the opponents|pg||
nt|yr: whichreally can be a lot worse in their style|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|junaid: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: This is the kind 1NT contract I hate declaring|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|oosmanb: @D seems to be the best suit. pip wise|pg||
nt|junaid: now...how many would pass 1@c here w/ a fit and an A?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|ehsana: question is how many down :)|pg||
nt|yr: but the problem with this for a normal partnership is u have to pass a 1@s response,,,not so much for them as they play 1@s response to 1@h as 5+|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ady: hearts 3-3 as well|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South should cash K@H before that exit, |pg||
nt|oosmanb: make life easier for N to cash out|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oosmanb: South could be caught on an endplay if North ducks this trick|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and if he overtakes he's himself endplayed|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: The 2@S bid caused problems for East. who couldnt bid 2NT anymore|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But I think the 2@D bid over 2@C cue caused the problem|pg||
nt|oosmanb: West had a very nice overcall|pg||

nt|junaid: u have the boss suit, no stopper in their suit and no fit for partner and u make a bid that comes out smelling like roses...wonderful game this bridge:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: North takes all the credit in that hand.. bid with Qx @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|junaid: and the bid showed nothing close to what u had|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|junaid: i guess he has to compensate if pard can have this hand for his 3@h...maybe 3@h promised half a stopper|pg||

nt|junaid: unlikely to get to game, but if S somehow manages to get there, he might very well make it on a @d lead|pg||
nt|yr: the other table also played 5@d & went down in 17 for a push|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 1@h- (1NT) |pg||

nt|junaid: i dont see why u wouldnt cash it, u can see the @ds controlled in your own hand and pard has clearly signalled for @s...but its not that clear at the table|pg||
nt|junaid: that board was a disaster for solox as well|pg||
mb|1S|nt|oosmanb: i think K@C is crystal clear :)|pg||

nt|tipu: a lot will depend on   16 result|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: anyone for 4H :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: In any case you're not establishing a trick for declarer by cashing K@H and are unblocking yourself, so I just dont see how it loses|pg||
nt|junaid: yes it is...w/ the @s in dummy, u dont know if pard's entry is the A or K and your own holding is such that if u play @s before @d u may set up their tricks there and if play @d ...|pg||
nt|junaid: before u may set up tricks there|pg||
nt|junaid: entry is usually not the only issue going thru your mind and sometimes that makes u do funny things at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I like 4@H at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|junaid: yes, nice bid|pg||
nt|junaid: wonder what chandna is thinking|pg||
nt|oosmanb: In the other room South had a chance to bring this 3NT home but didnt take it |pg||
nt|junaid: they had a chance for a nice pickup, an opportunity missed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ehsana: 4H play should be interesting too :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4NT for minors??? Surely not|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|junaid: surely not about sacrificing...but surely not about dbling either:)|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Some nice hands so far|pg||
nt|ehsana: 1 Imp difference ONLY :)..not comfy|pg||
nt|junaid: actually no, the same tricks, as in, no difference|pg||
nt|ehsana: N/S  can go wrong again in abidding a major game|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: does'nt E get a @h ruff as well junaid bhai?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This was good for DS, Tullo opened 2@S @S + minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|farrukh: As they say down 1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: effectively shutting out opponent's @H|pg||
nt|junaid: thats another good result for DS|pg||
mb|2S|an|8-11 6+!s|nt|ady: 11 easy tricks in spades for e/w  and 12 if defence slip|pg||
nt|yr: sabres were the underdogs in this semi final,,,i must say they have played really well until now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: another possible 4H :):)|pg||
nt|junaid: but remember there must have been some carryover for solox, so sabres have outscored them in this match so far|pg||
nt|junaid: its what they call a plus position...if a swing occurs, it will be in the favour of DS...unless of course if something unusual happens|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Yes this session is 21-3|pg||
nt|tipu: here it comes 11 Imp's in Brd   16 for Sabers|pg||
nt|yr: nobody was giving them even a remote chance|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|junaid: right, neither does @d through work for an extra trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: if 3@H was limit, it was a nice bid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|junaid: nicely done again...now u just need to make it:)|pg||
nt|junaid: even 6@c is a good sc|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can save at the 6 level for 500|pg||
nt|tipu: yes and the reason for that was purely the way they qualified   by only 1 VP margin|pg||
pc|s3|nt|junaid: dont see any problems there though|pg||
pc|s9|nt|junaid: difficult for E to play S for 3 Js only|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|junaid: the only possible entry in W hand could be the @sA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzkt: Datasteel Vs Candyland 48 - 15|pg||
nt|yr: that result just goes on to prove MEcstroths famous words " there are a lot of ways to win imps with a plus 480/490"|pg||
nt|tipu: as anothe team lost their last match 25-01:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: no blame attached to south    save could have been a phantom|pg||
nt|junaid: of course|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yr: the result on brd 16 i mean|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ehsana: strange play |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: hmmm I dont know about the 2@S lead.. perhaps 10 to ask for @D if pd wins the trick?|pg||
nt|tipu: if they would ve lost 25-02 they would ve gone through:(|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|yr: mean while declarer plays another thin 1N contract|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|junaid: its usually not a good idea to ruff air, and here it will make life easy for declarer...since he'll now be almost sure of catching the @cK onside and w/ the @h friendly he'll ...|pg||
nt|junaid: canter home|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|junaid: he needed to have the @ds set up to tempt N into letting his trumps get picked up|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Next Segment 11.50|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|oosmanb: agreed|pg||
nt|oosmanb: making +1 now infact|pg||
nt|yr: anything but a @c wud have led to 1|pg||
nt|junaid: but this may get ducked because S may have trouble counting the hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yr: now declarer has a chance|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d6|nt|ehsana: only 11 despite this play of small dmnd|pg||
nt|junaid: but W could see the A in his hand, so after the @d ruff he should cater to E holding @hAx|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|junaid: tough hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Good contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: is 2NT an asking bid, or bid your minor?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: It's usually 3@C pass/correct and 2NT asks strength etc|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: yes 2NT asking to bid the minor|pg||
nt|oosmanb: How many @H does NS make?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|oosmanb: Did North play 8 or 2 of @D ?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|junaid: but @c should make more if S takes the ace here...nice duck|pg||

nt|vugraphzaa: vi gör ett hopp bland brickorna för att få in lite resultat från slutna|pg||
nt|junaid: that play is almost impossible to find on the table auction...unless S reverses, W will not have the inspiration to defend it that way|pg||
nt|ehsana: some mess up on this brd is being sorted out |pg||
nt|vugraphzar: the hands as i can see are the opposite on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: E has W's cards and N has S's|pg||
nt|junaid: was this bd played at the other table? maybe it got reversed there...or maybe the dealing machine fouled it up|pg||
nt|yr: anther 3N here NS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk3: så får vi sammenligninger igen, når vi vender tilbage til spil 15|pg||
nt|oosmanb: finally some points for NS :)|pg||
nt|junaid: 4@h was cold on the lie of the cards on 33|pg||
nt|ehsana: pass 14 ponts|pg||
nt|junaid: is that pass correct Qasim?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: let me check some thing wrong here|pg||
nt|junaid: on 30 3NT proved too difficult to beat after a @d lead...W needs to bang down the @hA to beat it when he wins the @cA|pg||
nt|yr: maybe 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: but 3N more likely|pg||
nt|kareno:  3nt more likelu|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: 4@S should make e/w|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno:  likely|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: should not have a problem getting to game|pg||
nt|yr: yes Karen:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|oosmanb: 6@D? |pg||
nt|yr: 2N3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 3nt  hopefully not over bid :) by E/W|pg||
nt|ehsana: ..sryyyyyyyyy N/S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@D is very decent  I think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not making here..|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 4@H      hav e to play more carefully|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk3: Det er blevet et populært interval, 10-13|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Der må væfre en årsag, det må jeg ha' studeret|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Fantunes bruger det også|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: i Sverige kallas öppningen för Askeröd och är Arnes favoritkonvention|pg||
nt|ehsana: any slam will be hard work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: actually 6@d not that good|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: certainly 2@H and a diamond to lose in 4@H   and 4-1 break awkward|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|yr: @h 10 id guess|pg||
nt|yr: as a lead knowing E|pg||
pc|h6|nt|junaid: well...it needs @ds to break for starters...and then either, if no @ds losers u need to hold @s losers to 1, and if a @d loser then u have to play @ss for no losers...|pg||
nt|junaid: so dont think 6@d is such a hot contract|pg||
nt|yr: there it is!|pg||
nt|kareno:  Time for tea ... (_)?  ... and cookies ... OOOO|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oosmanb: yup|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|yr: yeah sure|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|oosmanb: however much hotter than 6@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|junaid: this NS p'ship was very good in the RR but we're now beginning to see problems|pg||
nt|junaid: ouch...thats a big bid facing shortness|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ehsana: scoop S10 6S may make :)|pg||
nt|junaid: the lack of partnership understanding is clear...bd 13 and now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Well I can see the problem|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its whether you play checkback here or not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and what the implies about 3@S |pg||
nt|ady: I see the 6@D was a swing to Solox    5@D played in CR|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: accident here      bad score for Sabres|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Declarer has a wry smile, seeing the dummy lay down|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahlnil0: Arne är dessutom från Askeröd :)|pg||

pc|h8|pc|d8|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Ofcourse. I meant 6@C CAN be made. not that it will be made|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or bid|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Finessing @c is the percentage play|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||

mc|11|nt|junaid: actually there's a much better line available on a red suit lead|pg||
nt|junaid: eliminate the reds, cashing the @cA on the way and if the K hasnt fallen exit a @c...if N started w/ Kx he will now be endplayed, if S has it, u take the @s hook|pg||

nt|ehsana: I cant tell you every ting BUT there was a mess up :)|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|junaid: alright alright, i'll lower my expectations...lol|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oosmanb: 6@D makeable on inspired play... instead of finessing Q,, you can play @S to K and then Jack.. pinning doubleton 10 and promoting 9|pg||
nt|ehsana: 9tricks in spades |pg||
nt|kareno:  1nt by north I think, whether he opens it or rebids it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|oosmanb: There's a theory that says.. in computer deals.. if you're in a "bad" slam... its usually still makeable but on antipercentage plays usually|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h8|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|junaid: a good reason is that holding a wk hand, its quite often a good move to start w/ your 4 card suit because u're more likely to find help from partner there|pg||
