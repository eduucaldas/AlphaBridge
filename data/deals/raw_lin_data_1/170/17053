mb|d|nt|psridhar: some play it as " i hv nothing to say "|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: some play it as " i wd hv passed 1@h X  "|pg||
nt|psridhar: everything has its merit but if undiscussed the guessing at table has no merit |pg||
nt|peachy: It is an older version so to speak, to play it as penalty, by math alone, it is almpost impossible for E to have penalty pass, three hands have shown opening or near opening valus|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|peachy: Here heart lead is not "from doubleton" in a sense, he is leading partner's suit|pg||

nt|lestergold: bonkers|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: and that was just the bid that S wanted to hear |pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south says why bid my known 8 card fit when i will probaBLY BUY A LOW SINGLETON IN MY SUIT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|santyclz: I think I would bid 3@d intending to bid 3@S over 3@h.|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|am007: little too ambitious|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: really?|pg||
nt|xenya: so the defence seems to have thrown 2 tricks here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz: The auction called for a trump lead.  In addition, the more unbalanced opening leader's hand is, the more the trump lead is appropriate.  0 for 2.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: you can read north's distribution on the auction and you know that hearts will be ruffed in dummy|pg||

nt|psridhar: usually he spends long time fig out such things losing a few hair in the process ( present count of his hair is ....any guess? ) :)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: this time they'll get to 6nt|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|peachy: In closed, E opened this 1NT. The late Grant Baze once wrote, if you open 1NT with five card major, you should have also three of the other major in case partner transfers|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|psridhar: admittedly difficult to diagnose the fits after the preempt-but i guess u shd cope playing a national final|pg||
nt|peachy: It seems that the Indian style new suit is nonforcing, and must cue to force|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: i think 4@d by W over 3@s =100% forcing ; but sumit probably wanted to show a @s fit to make auction easier|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: perhaps so, albeit only doubleton but a good doubleton|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|peachy: Well done both rooms|pg||
nt|psridhar: unfortunately tewari had a flat hand -else with 4 trump support he wd hv boosted the preempt|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 4@c is off 800 NV|pg||
nt|nkgupt: even w/ that he sud occupy 4@c cue at least:)|pg||
