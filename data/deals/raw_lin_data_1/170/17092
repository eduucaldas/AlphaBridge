nt|brolucius: I heard about a great defense from Zia this morning. His partner, who had opened 4H led the @HA against a slam. Dummy went down with a singleton and Zia false-carded the @HK from ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: @HK-x. Declarer ruffed the next round high from A-K-Q-x and Zia's J-x-x in trumps was promoted. Brilliant!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: eventually the scores from all matches will show here : http://www.bridgewinners.com/round-of-8|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yuval10: already some excitement, 6@d was made in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some commotion as other tables restart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss still studying.  deck may seem to have too many points in it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hamman had only a sevn-card suit but it might easily have been 8-card.|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann asks about 4D.  Gitelman writes: "I think splinter"|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yuval10: 5NT is interesting, of course in standart bridge it means to pick between 6 or 7, but it doesn't seem likely considering West' strength|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess North might bid 4NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: West leaps to 4@S rather than tip his hand with a cue-bid response. Interesting. He makes life more difficult for N/S that way.|pg||
nt|dburn: intending to convert clubs to diamonds to show 6-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: with 5-5, he would bid diamonds at once|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann exhales deeply. looks tired|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfe: green cards placed delicately on the tray|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar leans back, crosses his legs, still thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is great to see the top stars bid these competitive deals - a very difficult area for most of us.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue's strength limited by failure to open Precision @C|pg||

nt|dburn: as it is, diamonds may play better than hearts|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "sorry if this was wrong"|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 6@d actually a lot better than 6NT, you can make it even when the K@h is off ( playing small @s from hand towards the Q, then if south doesn't jump you discard the K@s over the 4th ...|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c and if he does you can discard 2 @h's )|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||

mb|p|nt|chorush: hi Wayne|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yuval10: NS in the OR judged very well to bid to the 5 level|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|brolucius: We are all indebted to BBO for letting us watch these top tournaments free of charge. I hope they don't change their mind one day...|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: EW put maximum pressure over South|pg||
nt|hedyg: shhhhhhh! dont give them ideas!|pg||
nt|wstuart: Have Chips and Lew changed to a str NT vul?|pg||
nt|wstuart: *Chip|pg||
nt|chorush: yes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: always thinking  about chips?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: but it seem as if he has a 5@h now|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@c= 2+|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will still be free for commentators, Hedy. No need to worry.|pg||
nt|chorush: that dbl has just transformed this hand from something resembling a push to a swing for Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: chip wrote 12-14|pg||
nt|wstuart: He wrote 12-14 on the notepad the operator says.  This is very un-Chip-like.  He's a very aggressive player and I wouldn't expect him to downgrade a controlish 15 HCP, even though ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: it is 4333.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: a short fight, finally|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss grimaces a bit, points at dummy, still making plans|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: shorter than next room, where EW pushed a bit|pg||
nt|chorush: It may only be 3rd 4th position vul|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: South must've been convinced that his Partner has void @s|pg||
nt|wstuart: At one time they played 12-14 in all seats *except* 3rd, where it was 15-17.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: on surface it looks like N's double meant to discourage his Partner of carry on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although if the kibitzers had to pay they would probably be less tolerant of the mistakes that the commentators make.|pg||
nt|dburn: optimistic, that - should South really have both majors stopped and the ace of clubs?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: still, this lead may let him escape for down only one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the result is an impossible 3NT in the wrong hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzfe: some question whether the 84-44 carryover is correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol no Liz|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is E/W bidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't make it with these cards, but maybe has more chance on the actual borad 3|pg||
nt|dburn: no, this is North-South bidding - they're just not bidding board 2 again|pg||
nt|harmon: theyve crossed rooms|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|wstuart: No real problems discarding with Katz's hand.  Martel is hoping for a miracle, but it doesn't appear to be a religious holiday for him.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|hedyg: A@S?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if one of the majors was bare, West might have made an unlucky choice of lead. It was adventurous bidding by N/S that could have worked better.|pg||
nt|dburn: true, and I guess if South had a couple of aces, the unstopped major might well be 4-4 anyway|pg||

nt|ferlema: ok|pg||
nt|wstuart: I would not have opened 1@H, either, unless in the context of a strong @C system.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Every conventional use of a bid has some downside. Stayman, probably the most uniformly played convention of all time, had a big downside on this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|wstuart: So, I tihnk their NT in 3rd seat white is 12-14 (15-17 vul 4rd only).|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|wstuart: I'm sure Stansby will upgrade this hand to a 15-17 NT evaluation.|pg||
nt|chorush: you are probably correct Wayne|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzfe: kibitzer sits behind brad.  our first as opposed to the mob hovering at the zia-hamman table|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman, after sitting still for a minute, grabs the pass card off his tray|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ritong: he had no real reason to get involved here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: a strong @c?|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: a hard job to do|pg||
nt|wstuart: Let me type tihs more accurately**So, I think their NT in 3rd seat white is 12-14 (15-17 vul 3rd only).|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wstuart: 2@D was GF checkback, I assume.|pg||
nt|chorush: Specs are asking why Stansby would upgrade his hand. the reason is the good 5 card suit mostly|pg||
nt|wstuart: The very fine controls are another reason.|pg||
nt|wstuart: I more true method than the A=4, K=3, Q=2, etc evaluation is to count Aces as 4.5, kings as 3 and Q and J as a little less than the Goren HCP representatoin.|pg||
nt|chorush: There is no obvious eighth trick here much less a ninth, so Meckwell did well to make 2NT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|yuval10: time to stop now|pg||

pc|c2|pc|h4|nt|yuval10: this seem to have no play at all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wstuart: Aces and Kings gain power the more distributional the contract hands are, and aces and Kings combined with a 5 card suit for NT is a very big plus.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|wstuart: Specs ask if a 1NT rebid could conceal 1 or 2 4 card majors the way Martel-Stansby are playing, and I believe the answer is yes, they tend to rebid 1NT to show the Strong NT when ...|pg||

nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of gazzilli, just upscaled|pg||
nt|bg: letssee|pg||
nt|ritong: you think he should act?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: just the manner, softly placing the card on the tray|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar: not the worst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: then asks who wants water; moss accepts|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: a club lead would mean quickly, this means slowly - assuming the defense does nothing silly|pg||
nt|wstuart: Doesn't 3 rds of @C beat it too, Ira?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: so far eldad has shown a strong 2 in @hs with questionable suit quality|pg||
nt|yuval10: double-dummy 6@h looks quite fair, but not today|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT is a kind of puppet, asking opener to come back to his opening suit|pg||
nt|ritong: unless ha has real good news|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|nt|ritong: they did not want to try the coup three in a row  remained possible, though|pg||
nt|ritong: in this context, 3@c instead of 2NT would be forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: here, pachtmann had relatively good news|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman seems always in control, never on tilt, never in a hurry|pg||
nt|ritong: moss cares about the excited part|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chorush: Eventually, declarer will lead a diamond toward the dummy and on the showout, will take 3 diamond tricks|pg||

nt|chorush: no diamond will be lost; delarer will pitch his two losing diamonds on the AK of hearts|pg||

mb|3S|nt|yuval10: this one looks routine|pg||
nt|ritong: other room EW got offboard due to the systemic 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ritong: showing the equivalent of a very good weak 2 in @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: if you wonder how they treat very strong hands, big @c is the answer|pg||
nt|ritong: any 16+ hand is opened 1@c|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a school of thought that one shouldn't Michaels with a 6 card Maj, however, I don't know if much analysis has been done on 7-5 bidding.  :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  looks liek Robert Levin|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The East hand is worth an extra point, with those controls and the five-card spades.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the convention card that I am looking at, 2NT shows only 20-21. That's puzzling.|pg||
nt|dburn: Cheek may well lead a heart, which will work rather well for him|pg||
nt|hedyg: except the @s suit is not nice and stiff AK not great for NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he downgraded?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Top players rarely downgrade.|pg||

nt|hedyg: i have 20-21(22) may have a 5 card major|pg||
nt|wstuart: As you can see from the 3@S bid - Martel is a very aggressive player, which is why I was surprised when he downgraded a control righ 15 HCP to a 12-14 NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  and can't miss Meckstroth....|pg||
nt|robbg:  Weinstein (r) meck (l) with backs to us|pg||

nt|dburn: in fact, it may not work at all|pg||
nt|dburn: though declarer will still have to guess the play extremely well|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@S is a control bid in @S showing a good hand and making a slam try in @Hs.|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4NT is likely RKC|pg||
nt|wstuart: Katz will likely jump showing the number of keycards and a void.|pg||
nt|chorush: They will have a way to show a void but Katz cannot be sure the void is not opposite an ace, as it happens to be here|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|jillan:  3 aces and a spade void|pg||

nt|jillan:  Nick bid hearts first so he should be playing right|pg||
nt|wstuart: Right - Nickell was playing it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: east took a short break|pg||
nt|wstuart: 6@D will make on this deal, but it is an odds-off contract.|pg||
nt|jillan:  can't they make 6@D here as the cards break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all players are back now|pg||
nt|chorush: This hand should be played in the very good 5 diamonds. 3NT undeservedly gains 2 imps so justice not served|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: east tried a 1NT overcall in other room i d be surprised to see gitelman duplicate this|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: aside from being off the @SA, 6@D requires both the @H finesse and 2-1 @D which will fail 22% of the time.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: assuming 1@s is the response here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  I know the percentage BUT you can't argue with the layout|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Sadam Hussein would describe this as the mother of all misfits.|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South will do well to go plus on these|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: what about the 1NT rebid?|pg||
nt|chorush: Most players will not rebid a 5 card minor nor reverse with such skimpy values, so 1NT is chosen as the alternative|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: a nightmare to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Was 3@D available?|pg||
nt|dburn: better not bid any more, or he may have a doubled nightmare to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: will Lauria double if Cheek bids again?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 2@s showed 6-5...|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chorush: 50 years ago it would  have been universal to open East's hand 1 heart and rebid 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|3H|nt|algraves: no could have been only 4 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't agree that it should show 5-6 (on the basis that North has denied four spades). That is a reasonable auction to describe a strong 4-6 hand. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: this contract has a lot of play|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h looks makeable, so Schwartz team likely gets some imps back|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman studying the trick before turning it|pg||
nt|ritong: trump looks clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: then why bid 3@H?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ritong: 7|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz' 3H bid here is announcing some black suit worry|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: brad has doubled, and not with a trump stack|pg||
nt|ritong: so he has values, including @h control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann lowers screen, asks about carding, gitelman answers UDCA|pg||
nt|dburn: he doesn't have a bad hand for hearts, or so he hopes - that @sJ would be a working card, and he has an ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|wstuart: The question was posed that if EW knew both hands, why would they not bid 6@D (not knowing the NS layout).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: down 2 or 3 it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, 3@d is pretty much bound to be hopeless unless partner miraculously has two of them|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever for Lauria to double, as I see it. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ron tried a small @h to his stiff jack, but unfortunately moss was aware about that card|pg||
nt|jillan:  because it is a poor slam|pg||
nt|chorush: mainly because it is about a 41% contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jillan:  it has ONE virtue - it makes|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|ritong: no clear reason to give up on trump attack|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lauria said he miscounted last hand, thought he had 21|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Did he really, though, or was that just to annoy N/S?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|bg: Fred may regret tossing Dia|pg||
nt|bg: now if S ruffs a dia he cannot get off dummy without E playng another dia but he can discarf a club now Fred doent have anther dia|pg||
nt|ritong: far sighted, bruce|pg||
nt|yuval10: other room has already played twice as many boards as played here|pg||
nt|bg: if he ruffs a club now he has to finesse the dia|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wstuart: To expand on my answer from above, the @H finesse is 50% and 3-0 @D is 22%, so the slam will fail 61% of the time (0.5 * 0.22).|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chorush: Commendable bidding from EW will cost them 1 imp|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: they are joking that it might go all pass at othe table|pg||

nt|brolucius: Looks good for a splinter bid.|pg||
mb|2H|an|nat inv|nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|wstuart: Since the IMP returns are +11 IMPs for 920 vs 420 and -10 IMPs for -50 vs -400, the slam needs to be an 11:21 favorite in order to break even, wihch is 52%|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|bg: yes 2h =5spades 4 hearts|pg||
nt|chorush: That's true, Wayne, when you compare it with 5 of a minor but not when 3NT is an alternative|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: West in the OR chose 1NT after South decided to open 1@d|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: possible 11 tricks  let s see|pg||

nt|hedyg: a joke it is for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: any shortness, 3@H ask and 3@S= singleton @C|pg||

nt|algraves: so all reasonable lines of play will work it seems|pg||
nt|robbg:  anyway that is backwards, if those were the only 2 possible results the needed odds would be 10/21|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: 3@D= fit and a singleton. 3@H asking etc|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfe: fred asked about 3H and brad asked about 3D but I didn't get conclusive answers|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: a limited hand, no more than 4-5 controls|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is reassuring when he takes so long to work out the best plan. Makes you want to give up the game when they pick up 12 tricks without pausing for breath.|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not easy|pg||
nt|algraves: lol, very complicated if you are trying to make with spades 3-1 as you would like to ruff 3 clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: he may start @cA, club ruff, @dQ intending to pitch a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: or, I suppose, he may just take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: don't see any other serious runners, but far from clear which of those two is favourite|pg||
nt|harmon: I think he needs the ht finesse, but I let better analysts decide|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he may be thinking of heart finesse and then if that works to finesse club with fall back on 2-2 spades with king on side|pg||
nt|brolucius: East did choose the splinter bid art the other table and, as you see, they have netted 1430 at the other table. If you put your cursor over the result, you can see the auction.|pg||
nt|algraves: first really big hand of the match as slam may not be bid in other room|pg||
nt|algraves: oh i see|pg||

nt|hedyg: ruff a @c first|pg||
nt|brolucius: The famous English player, Jeremy Flint, used to advise that you commit a huge amount of energy to the important boards. Operation Big Deal. That is exactly what Versace is doing.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: so partner doesn't make a costly opening lead from an unsupported king or something|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: usually after big club openers the defenders use 1NT as a surrogate cuebid|pg||

nt|brolucius: Another slam - just when I have to head for my wine-tasting. Ah well, it was 75 minutes very enjoyably spent. Bye!|pg||
nt|chorush: One of the disadvantages is that is allows the opponents to overcall freely at the one level. A major advantage is that it hinders the opponents from their natural bidding when ...|pg||
nt|chorush: they have the weak NT opener|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chorush: 2 clubs has not been alerted, but I believe it is a transfer to 2D which is a cue bid raise with 3 trumps|pg||
mb|d|nt|bg: NS have 7 losers hope they do not vul get them into unprofitable sac|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||

nt|algraves: so cheek and gure play negative doubles after 2NT unusual|pg||

nt|chorush: A double by Katz here might have turned what will be a minus into a plus|pg||

mb|p|nt|harmon: no diff|pg||

nt|ritong: a decision, al|pg||

nt|ritong: when south can have @d HHx, i agree small to ten is better|pg||
nt|dburn: might have been easier in hearts, this|pg||
nt|jillan:  this will cost....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: pass over 1@s is three @ss and mini values|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: will be down 2 since Martel won't get th diamond lead he was hoping for|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzfe: east says he forgot pass was forcing|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: now of course, if north ducks smoothly..|pg||
nt|ritong: redouble is " please look closer"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: and pass over 2@h is " no, really sorry mate"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: brad sees dummy, calls director, suggests ginossar has broken tempo over 2@S|pg||
nt|ritong: my perso style would be a fitjump in 2@s after pass|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: showing 5@s 4@d inviting values|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: none of these players will pass immediately with no problem as some others do|pg||
nt|dburn: in spades, declarer will have to pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: and he may not have the entries to do it, once he finds that East has four|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: after @SA lead @Dx seems even clearer -- then @DA and if suit not running, hope for 5@C 1@D 2@H 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if North wins @D -- well you're no worse off|pg||

pc|s7|nt|ritong: he had to decide early|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that should have been @D|pg||
nt|algraves: the downside to 2 suited interference is the distributional information it gives away|pg||
nt|dburn: Cheek may have been uncertain as to whether 4@h was an offer to play, or a control-bid for spades|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: for specs unfamiliar with the treatment    2N showed Balanced Game Force   a totally new concept that was introduced in 1920s|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: awkward for South, this|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chorush: Most partnerships have a rule that there are generally no new suits bid at the four level. So 4D is a cue for heartswith slam interest|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: depending on 1N rebid -- 1@H can be used to show exactly 3@H [1N=weak balanced hand] or 2/3@H  [1N=18-19]|pg||

nt|kit: Now East has to judge what his hand is worth opposite that -- and what bids mean maybe|pg||
nt|athene: you need some way of asking for aces on this sequence|pg||
nt|imp_jan: the sight of the @DJ might encourage east, he knows that @d are running|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder if they have had any discussion on followup meanings after 3NT call here.|pg||

mb|3S|nt|chorush: Stanby probably will bid 3S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i mentioned because South hand opposite a 14-16 NT improved during the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: well done Chip - knew you wouldn't let me down|pg||
nt|wstuart: I assume 3@C after 2NT would not have been forcing.|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know enuf about their methods|pg||
nt|wstuart: Although, after a 2 level nerg DBL opposite a str NT it seems like it should be.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if EW negotiate @C ruff beat is easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Katz is going to have a good idea what to lead if it plays here|pg||
nt|wstuart: Chip's sequence expresses doubt about 3NT and Lew's stopper is surely about as weak as they come.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - he cant pass, can he?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|algraves: now diamond and diamond will eventually beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but in real world ...|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he can't|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: my computer is having some problem|pg||
nt|algraves: now Versace will have to guess TX in trumps to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: just a little bit more Liz! |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so we will be back about 15 minutes after all finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry lag not responding|pg||
nt|algraves: pershaps south did overtake and it was missed by recorder|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he just misguessed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I tried to key it|pg||
nt|algraves: thrid diamond, and if neccessary 4th diamond promotes trump ten|pg||
nt|hedyg: np Liz, you didnt a good job! thanks @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: you did a good job* my keyboard too!|pg||
nt|algraves: even if south did not overtake it seems natural for West to misguess the third diamond after south wins trump ace|pg||
nt|sillafu: how can he misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: Liz it is minus 1 for sure?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the result of -1 confirmed|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now they need to not overstate their values.|pg||
nt|wstuart: VWD for Martel-Stansby!|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a reason they have won so many championships.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chorush: looks like this one can't be beaten|pg||
nt|wstuart: (VWD = very well done)|pg||

nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
