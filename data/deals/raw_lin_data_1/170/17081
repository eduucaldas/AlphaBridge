nt|athene: west just intending it as "extras" and east as a lot more penalty-oriented|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: and bid some number of spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: opening and closing his hand is Bas|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: He is now doing the thinking man pose|pg||
nt|athene: if you bid 5@S now is that only asking for a heart control|pg||
nt|athene: or is it just a general invitation?|pg||
nt|athene: partner could have a pretty respectable double and you could still be off a spade trick and the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: not easy|pg||
nt|athene: this is why i think it's good to open 4 of a major more often than most people do|pg||
nt|athene: you give the opponents a lot of headaches|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|athene: now south has a heart control AND good spades|pg||
nt|athene: so it will be hard to turn this one down|pg||
nt|athene: since those are the two things that 5@S usually asks for|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand south hasn't got anything else |pg||
nt|athene: so he might just pass anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Brink now thinking with hands on chin|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: @CA lead very bad|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: well the defence are ok as long as hamman doesn't try to cash his other ace|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: but no reason to do that|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: if north has a club in his hand, this contract is never making|pg||
