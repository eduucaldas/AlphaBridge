nt|ady: west pass?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|junaid: please remember that NS are a first time partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: a pretty light overcall by TM but thats his style and it has worked for him often enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: and his partner should be surprised to find him w/ this hand|pg||

nt|ebrok: men spar ud er også 9 stik. |pg||
nt|junaid: and a correct @c guess would even allow him to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|junaid: this could turn into an 11imp pickup for sabres|pg||
nt|tipu: this will be an interesting segment as we all expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: North telling E to just enjoy his game and not take any pressure :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ehsana: any bets on 4S by East:)|pg||
mb|2C|an|5-5 majors|nt|tipu: rightly so|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ehsana: 5D on too|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead should beat it and w/ trump control, TM will likely find the lead and then finding entry in N hand is not a matter of choice, only one option|pg||
nt|ehsana: 5D playable cntrct|pg||
nt|tipu: East Uzair Kamal is responsible for making a lit of good yougsters to excell |pg||
nt|tipu: lot |pg||
nt|Walddk4: West you mean|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|junaid: nothing else makes sense...also, has no one every opened namyats missing the AK of trumps?|pg||

nt|tipu: welcome Yasir|pg||
nt|yr: a strange looking contract here,, 5@c is more normal|pg||
nt|kareno:  What was the 1@c bid?|pg||
mc|10|nt|yr: this should go down on accurate defence|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzaq: sorry its EW whose hands are inverted.|pg||
nt|junaid: this should be a good result for sabres...but then we dont know what the auction was|pg||
nt|junaid: 3NT is cold for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: EW in 5@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so enter 5@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: by someone|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: Yes, what was 1@C|pg||
nt|yr: i really have no idea what wwas 1@c,,maybe a psych|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: true, but unless @s is played by N, there will be no @c lead and then W will have to shift to a @c after a high @d lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jillan:  dom Ã¤r lÃ¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥ngsamma vid andra bordet|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: For Cricket Lovers...Zimbawi  9 for 2 in 4 overs  against Pakistan |pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzaa: allt är relativt :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: men Troberg-Knutsson är nog bland de långsammare paren i den här tillställningen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: little to make here    2@S  may or may not make|pg||
mb|3N|nt|junaid: and sibanda just hit a 4 off gul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hardly when West bid 2@D|pg||
nt|kareno:  5@c down on diamond ruff assuming north leads that or a heart.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ehsana: face savings pass of 2D by East|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe they play reversed minor openings?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: apologies for the lack of play on last brd, E/W's hands were dealt the other way round here|pg||
nt|yr: then maybe operator error|pg||
nt|tipu: another unlucky contract|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think that's a very reasonable defence, after A@D, dummy is void in @h so no future there, you can see 10@C so pd might even be ruffing the first one|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|ady: 1NT certainly will make on that lead|pg||
nt|kareno:  Yes, doomed on the spade lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk3: Brunzell är i 3NT vid andra bordet|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kareno:  That explains the auction!!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk3: 1 bet snart|pg||
nt|junaid: strange decision from E not to invite, but this might work out quite well|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|kareno:  So are they dealt backwards in the CR also?  or is that a fouled board?|pg||

nt|ady: dubious for west to rake action|pg||
nt|yr: i thought it was heading for down 4,,,|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s have possibilities of a minor suit slam|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ehsana: 4H by East ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: EW are really fast players  so i can understand the operator having problems|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kareno:  Nice diamond slam ifthey dan find it.|pg||
nt|tipu: yes right|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: this should be a routine 4@h contract|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT  also look likely to make|pg||
nt|ady: can take 13 tricks on good heart view|pg||
nt|kareno:  can|pg||
nt|tipu: minor slam|pg||
mb|4D|nt|oosmanb: 4 of either major seems fine|pg||
nt|ehsana: a major game for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 4S will be take n to teh Cleaners |pg||
nt|ady: likely to end in small slam|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ehsana: 4S looks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 3NT bästa kontrakt|pg||
mb|5H|nt|junaid: S hand tailor made for walsh, showing 4441 GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: strange double|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: S asked W if 4@h was weak|pg||
mb|6D|nt|junaid: it would've ended up going to the cleaners if EW dbled, but that is not a clear at the table action|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: 3@d inquired about, alerted as natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Kommer att gå hem i 4@S också när klövermasken ordnar sig|pg||

nt|yr: here comes the good old 4nt,,,,|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ehsana: my humble opinion 4S bettr than 4H :)|pg||
nt|tipu: yes they did|pg||
nt|tipu: still have to guess the @c right|pg||
pc|h3|nt|junaid: even now they seem to be on their way to 6m...needs luck, but its there, minors breaking and one of the two red hooks on|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT has merit here as 6@D might fail with bad trump split and badly place with 6NT making |pg||
nt|vugraphzar: explained, rather than alerted|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yr: its normal to play some sort of Kickback in minor suit slam auctions but NS here are from the old school|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: 3@h sorry|pg||
nt|kareno:  Pitch on heart|pg||

pc|d3|nt|junaid: :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ehsana: some systems can expose dual major holdings:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: making this harder by messing up entries for @C ruffs.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|junaid: luckily for dec only one way hook available in @d and that happens to work|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ehsana: In 4S he had almost 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: no way of knowing which 4 is better during auction|pg||
pc|d8|nt|oosmanb: so lets call them both good contracts :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kareno:  Yes, but it's normal to play the spades for queen (at least) on declarer's right.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ehsana: .BUT 4H struggles :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Sabres have picked up 14 imps for board 1|pg||

pc|h6|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||

nt|oosmanb: In any case you're not establishing a trick for declarer by cashing K@H and are unblocking yourself, so I just dont see how it loses|pg||
nt|junaid: yes it is...w/ the @s in dummy, u dont know if pard's entry is the A or K and your own holding is such that if u play @s before @d u may set up their tricks there and if play @d ...|pg||
nt|junaid: before u may set up tricks there|pg||

nt|vugraphzaa: vi gör ett hopp bland brickorna för att få in lite resultat från slutna|pg||
nt|junaid: that play is almost impossible to find on the table auction...unless S reverses, W will not have the inspiration to defend it that way|pg||
nt|ehsana: some mess up on this brd is being sorted out |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk3: så får vi sammenligninger igen, når vi vender tilbage til spil 15|pg||

nt|junaid: 4@h was cold on the lie of the cards on 33|pg||
nt|ehsana: pass 14 ponts|pg||
nt|junaid: is that pass correct Qasim?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: let me check some thing wrong here|pg||
nt|junaid: on 30 3NT proved too difficult to beat after a @d lead...W needs to bang down the @hA to beat it when he wins the @cA|pg||
nt|yr: maybe 5@d|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yr: but 3N more likely|pg||
nt|kareno:  3nt more likelu|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S should make e/w|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno:  likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: should not have a problem getting to game|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 6@D? |pg||

mb|2N|nt|ehsana: 3nt  hopefully not over bid :) by E/W|pg||
nt|ehsana: ..sryyyyyyyyy N/S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@D is very decent  I think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not making here..|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 4@H      hav e to play more carefully|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Det er blevet et populært interval, 10-13|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Der må væfre en årsag, det må jeg ha' studeret|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk3: Fantunes bruger det også|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: i Sverige kallas öppningen för Askeröd och är Arnes favoritkonvention|pg||
nt|ehsana: any slam will be hard work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: actually 6@d not that good|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: certainly 2@H and a diamond to lose in 4@H   and 4-1 break awkward|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yr: @h 10 id guess|pg||
nt|yr: as a lead knowing E|pg||
pc|hT|nt|junaid: well...it needs @ds to break for starters...and then either, if no @ds losers u need to hold @s losers to 1, and if a @d loser then u have to play @ss for no losers...|pg||
nt|junaid: so dont think 6@d is such a hot contract|pg||
nt|yr: there it is!|pg||
nt|kareno:  Time for tea ... (_)?  ... and cookies ... OOOO|pg||
pc|h6|nt|oosmanb: yup|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yr: yeah sure|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|oosmanb: however much hotter than 6@S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|junaid: this NS p'ship was very good in the RR but we're now beginning to see problems|pg||
nt|junaid: ouch...thats a big bid facing shortness|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ehsana: scoop S10 6S may make :)|pg||
nt|junaid: the lack of partnership understanding is clear...bd 13 and now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Well I can see the problem|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its whether you play checkback here or not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and what the implies about 3@S |pg||
nt|ady: I see the 6@D was a swing to Solox    5@D played in CR|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: accident here      bad score for Sabres|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Declarer has a wry smile, seeing the dummy lay down|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|ahlnil0: Arne är dessutom från Askeröd :)|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|junaid: a good reason is that holding a wk hand, its quite often a good move to start w/ your 4 card suit because u're more likely to find help from partner there|pg||
