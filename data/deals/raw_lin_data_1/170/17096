mb|p|nt|chorush: Well, Jon, I would bid 3 would 4 clubs in a 4-4-3-2 and this hand is a trick better. but that's just me|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is quite aggressive|pg||
nt|chorush: Certainly perfectly reasonable to bid 3|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C forces to 3@S so zia knows 3@H isn't ending the auction|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to actually give NS a problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pulls pass, reconsiders|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h : bidding my cards. very often right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H correct with balanced weak hand - with 5431 need to bid more that 3 after dbl at 1 @S of p|pg||
nt|athene: people sometimes bid 4@H in these situations hoping to induce a 4@S sac which might be a costly phantom|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: did his thing of pointing around the tray, waved his hand as if giving up, pulled pass, then put it back|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: but at this vulnerability you don't expect north to bid 4@S without some chances of making|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|chorush: A match like this is physically and mentally exhausting. Every player knows that the match might hinge on any card played or bid made|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|poohbear: This is a slam on the @h position. On a @d lead need 3-2 but on a non @d lead you can lead twice toward the Q10x and pick up many 4-1 breaks|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3-2 and a correct guess but no guess here|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|chorush: Looks like a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer finds the @CK before he has to attack trumps he might drop the @SK, but that doesn't really help unless he can get a trump coup going|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Hamman crosses his arms and looks askew at the tray|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfd: something seems to have gone awry|pg||
nt|chorush: definite misunderstanding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hamman perhaps thinks it was system on in which case 3@S might be both minors with short spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that's a common response to 1nt - 3major = minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|chorush: In the normal course of events 3S would probably have been a singleton with 5-4-3-1 pattern|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: fleisher asking.  zia: he probably forgot that's a natural bid. all 3bids after NT overcall are natural|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chorush: Weinstein going to see what i always see on the heart K lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: rusinow @HQ, K is the big lead to ask for unblock|pg||
nt|poohbear: lotta blockage|pg||
nt|chorush: However, even though there are 9 tricks available, it may not be possible to take them all|pg||
nt|poohbear: Zia Needs to guess which ace Weinstein has in order to KO it first|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hamman has scratched out the 690 and written 720 on his scorecard|pg||
nt|poohbear: so the match is tied|pg||
nt|poohbear: but it wont be after this hand|pg||
nt|chorush: This will definitely be a swing. I dont see how he can make it. Weinstein will duck the KQ of spades and then?|pg||
nt|poohbear: If declarer ducks the first @h a @c shift beats it|pg||
nt|poohbear: Though it might be a good play as who would play declarer for the @h ace|pg||
nt|poohbear: wellll its Zia :)|pg||
nt|drewsky: I would ALWAYS play declarer for the heart ace if he took this long at trick one.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: particularly a declarer who seldom takes time at trick 1 to make plans|pg||
nt|passell: can make it dbl dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: could probably clean up board 60 while we're waiting but will do it after this hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats why it should be routine to always take some time when dummy hits|pg||

pc|s8|nt|poohbear: this might work too|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, he can make it now |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hamman takes of his glasses, sits upright, crosses his arms|pg||
nt|drewsky: I think if north returned the heart nine instead of the spade he had a legitamate beat|pg||
nt|poohbear: If he plays the Ace he is playing for stiff Honor offside or 2-2 @ss and @cs 3-3. But the 8 is a very suspicious card. If Weinstein had Q84 he prob returns the 4|pg||
nt|poohbear: and he didnt even think about it|pg||
nt|passell: he had no chance with a heart back|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chorush: He might. We will never find out|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Im sure he will bid 4 spades here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was worried his partner might pass a 2@S raise with a minimum hand but heart fit and they could miss 4M|pg||
nt|athene: but surely 2@S is the normal action|pg||
nt|chorush: Think he is worried that there could be a slam as indeed there would if pard had the club ace instead of diamond ace|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|kit: I think Meckstroth should have bid 1NT, not 2@C|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: so did Rodwell|pg||
nt|dinos1: even vul 3N is less than heavy penalty|pg||
nt|kit: this should be down 5 at least, I think, maye 6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can go for an above -1100 and will close the match with Fleisher as winners|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 63 could be a swing to Nickell, if they get to 3N -- 9 tricks there aren't there|pg||
nt|wstuart: Good point, Kit.  S played N for 5 @C when he didn't pull to 1NT|pg||
nt|dinos1: agree, 1N is most flexible|pg||

nt|jaapfr: for EW|pg||
nt|passell: match would have been tied had zia made a difficult 3nt on 61|pg||

nt|dinos1: win 10|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can you give the final answer to b61 could it be made if @SKQ soon and ducked??|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: zia says if hamman bids a suit over 3Nt it should be a cuebid for spades.  fleisher then asks kamil how they play it|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he tries to ruff a @C, perfect defense would get him 3, but cashing one trump prevented that|pg||

nt|chorush: its going to end very close. Probably 10 imps to Nickell here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Still plenty of hands left in @d Berg match|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia turns over h5 at once.  weinstein makes him leave it up - thinking about the hand|pg||
nt|chorush: Keep in mind that the scores we have up here are not official|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: "you can play a @c but I'm still going to think"|pg||
nt|poohbear: yu mean to fleisher|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfd: zia very fast again - not one to take time making plans - fleisher has to ask to see the spots again|pg||
nt|athene: south might duck this to give declarer a losing option - he could then try a low spade playing for Ax / Jxx|pg||
nt|athene: but he shouldn't do that because with Ax the defender should not duck the queen|pg||
nt|athene: it would just be a grosvenor|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jaapfr: ty |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: clarifying that @H6 is count and @C7 is smith - but academic in the face of 1100|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: levin looks at some previous hand then slams the board onto the floor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: small condoleance : making results in -10 imps here as even if it was not made it was -15 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia still staring at the dummy.  levin sighs for the thousandth time|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3 called but 2 played|pg||
nt|athene: if anyone is not sure about "grosvenor" - the basic idea is, you should not play for a defender to have done something "wrong"|pg||
nt|athene: so|pg||
nt|athene: let's say south did duck the @SQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia: "I thought you were showing out!" when kamil took @SA|pg||
nt|athene: you should still continue with the king from hand, not a little one|pg||
nt|athene: because if the ace was doubleton, they could always have got 2 tricks legitimately anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so you never lose by it|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|athene: what you want to avoid is losing 2 tricks where you "shouldn't" with best play all round|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfd: everyone clusters around to check the score.  that's all for now, back in maybe 20 minutes|pg||

pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: in other words to lose with 108-131  or 108-136 (theoretically if down) not a big deal to end with|pg||
