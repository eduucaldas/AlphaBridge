nt|junaid: welcome back for the 3rd segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: a pretty light overcall by TM but thats his style and it has worked for him often enough|pg||
nt|yr: hi tony|pg||
nt|yr: ordinary bidding by E here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|junaid: and his partner should be surprised to find him w/ this hand|pg||
nt|junaid: should NOT|pg||
nt|yr: that seq shows sumthing like a 19 count|pg||
nt|golfergolf: In the OR mow|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|junaid: works out well|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 diamonds shows values it seems, and east takes a pot at 3N|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ehsana: 2Nt may end up in the red :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back|pg||
nt|jcwla: This hand right at the tip-top of the range for the 2@C-2NT rebid.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: plucky balance from east    |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|junaid: S plays namyats, N does not:)|pg||
nt|junaid: but 3NT should make for EW tho it will take play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last segment of 12 boards|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcwla: Barry Crane: "God deals you A-K so you don't have a lead problem."|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk3: Udspil fra Jxxx koster altid et stik|pg||
nt|yr: which will cost him dearley|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT   but would have to play well on a spade lead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Ingen undtagelse her|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tipu: hello again|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h2|pc|dT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yr: if they play leb,,then the W hand was an OK 3@d bid,, but really E shd pass it,,,,,it shows sumthing like 8-bad 11 hcp|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tipu: thnx Roland:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ebrok: "altid" er nu alligevel meget, men hvad ellers?|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|oosmanb: Is this right?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Namyats?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcwla: This smells like 1 to Solox but here we're feeding comparisons to the CR so on to the next.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ehsana: 8 tricks some struggle :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||

nt|ebrok: men spar ud er også 9 stik. |pg||
nt|junaid: and a correct @c guess would even allow him to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|junaid: this could turn into an 11imp pickup for sabres|pg||
nt|tipu: this will be an interesting segment as we all expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: North telling E to just enjoy his game and not take any pressure :)|pg||
nt|yr: -500 is a disaster anyway,,,,,if dbled it cudve been a catastophe!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ehsana: any bets on 4S by East:)|pg||
nt|yr: well i think W shd use leb if available|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the may have retreated to 4 diamonds if doubled|pg||
nt|yr: 4@h EW here|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|tipu: rightly so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Karen Allison|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|oosmanb: Surely cant be namyats, if South has AK@H... |pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|tipu: W is a man likely to get under pressure in these situations|pg||
nt|kareno:  Good morning from cloudy New York City :)|pg||
nt|tipu: Hello Karen|pg||
nt|tipu: but East is as cool as ice:)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: But I guess if you agreed on a convention and it comes your way, you trust it :)|pg||
nt|yr: yes tony,,,,they might as well have ran from 3N dbled so passing was very wise of south|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand   e/w 3@C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yr: another leb seq to reach the par contract of 4@h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ehsana: 5D on too|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead should beat it and w/ trump control, TM will likely find the lead and then finding entry in N hand is not a matter of choice, only one option|pg||
nt|ehsana: 5D playable cntrct|pg||
nt|tipu: East Uzair Kamal is responsible for making a lit of good yougsters to excell |pg||
nt|tipu: lot |pg||
nt|Walddk4: West you mean|pg||
nt|jcwla: S elects to make the 3@C despite holding only six @C and a mediocre four-card @H suit on the side, finds a nice catch.  A pass might have kept NS out of the auction entirely, and ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: now a super-protective reopening double by E and N is in a happy place.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|junaid: nothing else makes sense...also, has no one every opened namyats missing the AK of trumps?|pg||
nt|yr: should make without too many problems on this lead|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|oosmanb: No, by definition|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps north may have considered doubling the 3 spades for the lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tipu: yes West|pg||
nt|tipu: thnk God I mentioned the name Uzair I meant:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yasser Rahim|pg||
nt|yr: hi all|pg||
nt|tipu: welcome Yasir|pg||
nt|yr: a strange looking contract here,, 5@c is more normal|pg||
nt|kareno:  What was the 1@c bid?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yr: this should go down on accurate defence|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ebrok: Det var en rigtig stor pas i øst!?|pg||
nt|junaid: even then, E can bank on @hs for @c pitches after 2 rounds of trumps...interesting play problem|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|oosmanb: However  NS might get lucky, since 4@S nor 5@C makes on the last board, on correct defence|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yr: correct,,, & Jay usually dosnt miss the oppurtunity|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: should be 10 tricks without spade lead|pg||
nt|yr: delarer on the right track|pg||
pc|c4|nt|junaid: no option here but to hook|pg||
nt|ehsana: early pressure :)|pg||
nt|junaid: Qxx in N way less probable|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks   south should get end played |pg||
nt|ady: sorry    likely 7 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yr: EW are a very steady pair,,, so the last hand 500 was rather uncharacteristic|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|junaid: hello everyone|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|yr: a @c ruff shd be teh last defensive trick|pg||

pc|h4|nt|junaid: this will be interesting...if the defense cash their 2@d tricks early it'll make, else go down a trick and will result in 10 to solox|pg||

nt|ajq: yes, 4H has a good play for Solox|pg||
nt|junaid: moreover, they need to dbl 5@c and lead trump at every opportunity to get the max|pg||
nt|junaid: 5@cX sould be par|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: hello all :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@H - 2@C - 2NT - 3NT or some variant likely here.|pg||
nt|yr: p-p-1@c-p-p-p looks normal,but S is known to respond on weaker hands than this|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|Walddk4: Yes, what was 1@C|pg||
nt|yr: i really have no idea what wwas 1@c,,maybe a psych|pg||
nt|yr: my bet is S will bid 1@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|junaid: true, but unless @s is played by N, there will be no @c lead and then W will have to shift to a @c after a high @d lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south will bid ok|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jillan:  dom Ã¤r lÃ¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥ngsamma vid andra bordet|pg||
nt|ady: north may go to game|pg||
nt|ady: 5 card support   free bid 2nd round from south|pg||
nt|yr: he does!|pg||
mb|d|nt|ehsana: For Cricket Lovers...Zimbawi  9 for 2 in 4 overs  against Pakistan |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzaa: allt är relativt :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: men Troberg-Knutsson är nog bland de långsammare paren i den här tillställningen|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: little to make here    2@S  may or may not make|pg||
nt|yr: they may reach game in @s  now|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: and sibanda just hit a 4 off gul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hardly when West bid 2@D|pg||
nt|kareno:  5@c down on diamond ruff assuming north leads that or a heart.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
nt|golfergolf: sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ehsana: face savings pass of 2D by East|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe they play reversed minor openings?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: apologies for the lack of play on last brd, E/W's hands were dealt the other way round here|pg||
nt|yr: then maybe operator error|pg||
nt|tipu: another unlucky contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: well done by EW, not easy to reach...friendly black suits lie will allow it to make|pg||
nt|ady: only 2 top losers   but no way to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Interesting choice by north|pg||
nt|yr: well N goes for 3N after showing 3@s via supp dbl & S stands for it,,|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcwla: Offshape double will not deter them.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|junaid: 9 top tricks here|pg||
nt|junaid: 10 now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oosmanb: I think that's a very reasonable defence, after A@D, dummy is void in @h so no future there, you can see 10@C so pd might even be ruffing the first one|pg||
nt|ajq: this may be the 10th :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: 1NT certainly will make on that lead|pg||
nt|kareno:  Yes, doomed on the spade lead|pg||
nt|junaid: not anymore|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk3: Brunzell är i 3NT vid andra bordet|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno:  That explains the auction!!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 1 bet snart|pg||
nt|junaid: strange decision from E not to invite, but this might work out quite well|pg||
nt|junaid: i keep getting proven wrong...lol|pg||
nt|ady: east needs to play low|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: well played|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kareno:  So are they dealt backwards in the CR also?  or is that a fouled board?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ehsana: nice pass by Kamal..probably 9 tricks for wajahat Suri|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: Often wrong but never in doubt :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 spades down on careful defence, so this could be a great decision|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yr: right,,,,,its going to make now|pg||
nt|golfergolf: 1 chance left, will make|pg||
pc|s8|nt|junaid: lol|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sK|nt|oosmanb: making exactly|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: that was just a one off board|pg||
nt|yr: if he takes the @c hook|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pc|c2|nt|ehsana: quits a few players contort the system they play...this pass is one case :)|pg||

nt|junaid: the thoughless 2nd round of @s was the problem...if he really wanted to play a @s, he should have played the K from hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: skipping brd 15 for the time being, will get back to it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Has north an opening bid?|pg||
nt|yr: hi qasim|pg||
nt|yr: another big hand for N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Qasim|pg||
nt|yr: 3N looks like the final resting place here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s have possibilities of a minor suit slam|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ehsana: 4H by East ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: EW are really fast players  so i can understand the operator having problems|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno:  Nice diamond slam ifthey dan find it.|pg||
nt|tipu: yes right|pg||
nt|ajq: the pair of Chandna and Liaqat have done very well during the round robin matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: this should be a routine 4@h contract|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT  also look likely to make|pg||
nt|ady: can take 13 tricks on good heart view|pg||
nt|kareno:  can|pg||
nt|tipu: minor slam|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubtless south will get to 4 spades now|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|oosmanb: 4 of either major seems fine|pg||
nt|ehsana: a major game for E/W|pg||
nt|jcwla: A normal light opener here with A-A-K connected, I don't love 2NT with such woeful @D's but if ever this is the vul for it, 3@C looks like invitational or better values with @H's, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: and 5@C escapes without an ax.|pg||
nt|junaid: omg...trump leads are almost mandatory in such acutions|pg||
nt|yr: south uses leb|pg||
nt|yr: cant see a reason though,,,,a direct 3N bid shd be ok|pg||
nt|yr: but maybe hes worried about @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 4S will be take n to teh Cleaners |pg||
nt|ady: likely to end in small slam|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ehsana: 4S looks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 3NT bästa kontrakt|pg||
nt|yr: & now,,,he may choose the 43 @s fit|pg||
nt|golfergolf: hopes 3N with @C Qx|pg||
nt|yr: when N bids out his shape shoing a singlton @c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: will bid 3N|pg||
mb|4S|nt|junaid: S hand tailor made for walsh, showing 4441 GF|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well defence can still prevail|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but needs to be careful|pg||
nt|ady: chance on this lead|pg||
nt|ady: about the only lead it can make|pg||
nt|golfergolf: doesn't know stiff K|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: strange double|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: S asked W if 4@h was weak|pg||
nt|yr: i doubt it,,,i|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: it would've ended up going to the cleaners if EW dbled, but that is not a clear at the table action|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: 3@d inquired about, alerted as natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Kommer att gå hem i 4@S också när klövermasken ordnar sig|pg||
nt|jillan:  det hÃ¤r borde gÃ¥ bra ocksÃ¥, eftersom bl a @S J Ã¤r hos Ã¶st|pg||
nt|oosmanb: After that lead.. yes :) declarer must be scared|pg||
nt|yr: here comes the good old 4nt,,,,|pg||
nt|junaid: not that it would make a difference here|pg||
nt|junaid: since the contract is not dbld|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well the heart was best, but on some lines there is a trump promo it seems|pg||
nt|yr: he did go for the moysian fit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|qasim2003: shud'nt he bid 3N even if N has a singleton @c rag...as @d and @h are the source of tricks?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: with Jxxx, he should not want to play there|pg||
nt|yr: he dosnt know if @d are solid,,,4@s makes sense,,|pg||
nt|yr: but now he has his work cut out,,,he needs to make this|pg||
nt|yr: wats the best line here , Tony|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: go back and bid 3N is the best line, to bid 4 spades is crazy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ehsana: my humble opinion 4S bettr than 4H :)|pg||
nt|tipu: yes they did|pg||
nt|tipu: still have to guess the @c right|pg||
nt|qasim2003: :)|pg||
nt|yr: :) |pg||
nt|qasim2003: he needs @d's 3-3 for sure |pg||
nt|qasim2003: maybe ruff 2 @c's in dummy to start with ?|pg||
nt|yr: 1 ruff is needed,,,but he cant enjoy the @ds without somehow drawing trumps|pg||
nt|qasim2003: all cards lie very badly for the declarer ...so the best line is ask for an undo and bid 3N:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Well he is still thinking|pg||
nt|yr: he needs to,,,& i cant think of a reasonable line even seeing all cards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: will do well to be -1, really|pg||
pc|c6|nt|junaid: even now they seem to be on their way to 6m...needs luck, but its there, minors breaking and one of the two red hooks on|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT has merit here as 6@D might fail with bad trump split and badly place with 6NT making |pg||
nt|vugraphzar: explained, rather than alerted|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|yr: its normal to play some sort of Kickback in minor suit slam auctions but NS here are from the old school|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzar: 3@h sorry|pg||
nt|kareno:  Pitch on heart|pg||
nt|yr: the declarer is Very competent & id bet on him making this|pg||
nt|tipu: I meant @s|pg||
nt|tipu: thnx for correcting Karen|pg||
nt|junaid: N showed something like a 5431 and S chose to play game in a 4-3 fit at the 4 level rather than in 5@c...very reasonable from S's angle|pg||
pc|d6|nt|junaid: :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S10 will doom it|pg||
nt|ady: yes   4th diamond|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if the diamond is cashed, trump ten can be promoted, otherwise 2 hearts to lose|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|ehsana: some systems can expose dual major holdings:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: making this harder by messing up entries for @C ruffs.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|junaid: luckily for dec only one way hook available in @d and that happens to work|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|h3|nt|ehsana: In 4S he had almost 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: no way of knowing which 4 is better during auction|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so lets call them both good contracts :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|junaid: thats another result DS can take to the bank|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno:  Yes, but it's normal to play the spades for queen (at least) on declarer's right.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ehsana: .BUT 4H struggles :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Sabres have picked up 14 imps for board 1|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|h5|nt|oosmanb: Seldom contracts that struggle, only declarers :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kareno:  He needed to play the spade when he was in dummy with the diamond ace!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange exit|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tipu: now he needs 2 entries for @s hook:)|pg||
nt|yr: o/e discards for EW,,so E has told the truth with @s 7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|h6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: hand 1 was an 11 imps swing for Sabres    3NT for e/w went down in CR|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|oosmanb: Timing was hard in this hand, so declarer did well to make|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|yr: opps|pg||
nt|tipu: @c finnese i coming|pg||
nt|junaid: but since no game makes, this may not be a big loss|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|junaid: that was quite a likely result|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tipu: oooopss|pg||
nt|kareno:  Very costly error there.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yr: that was a pretty reasonable line of play,,,,tough luck for south|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Like Junaid bhai predicted 4@S defence wasnt easy :)|pg||
nt|ehsana: yes nicely played by wajaha|pg||
nt|yr: i think he played too quickly|pg||

nt|ady: 2@H may have a minor   west looking for a better spot  |pg||

mb|p|nt|ehsana: 10 tricks available in Clubs for E/W|pg||

nt|jcwla: A quiet pass here from S.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: I'm impressed by that, well judged by both teams|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jillan:  Jag skulle ha vÃ¤ldigt svÃ¥rt att bjuda 3@H med Pias kort|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  cant make on a club lead   in fact  3@H goes down |pg||
nt|yr: yes & so the match is ON|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4H and 3Nt  both possible with N/S|pg||
nt|junaid: 5@d should be reachable now?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|junaid: no, E prefers to play a possible 4-3 fit when he should know that a 5-3 or better exists|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ajq: even 4H should be making easily|pg||
nt|jcwla: W elects not to go to war with just K-fourth opposite E's shortness and they've chosen the @H game which can come home.|pg||

nt|ehsana: part game for N/S|pg||

mb|p|nt|yr: a typical modern day 3rd seat opener|pg||

nt|junaid: sabres have come out firing:)|pg||
nt|ady: no problems here    might even make 10 tricks as they lay|pg||

nt|yr: well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oosmanb: :) I was wondering if you multiply your scale by 10 for the fun of it|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|oosmanb: @D seems to be the best suit. pip wise|pg||
nt|junaid: now...how many would pass 1@c here w/ a fit and an A?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|junaid: they've gotten lucky here, W should support @ds and then no idea where u'll end up|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ehsana: question is how many down :)|pg||
nt|yr: but the problem with this for a normal partnership is u have to pass a 1@s response,,,not so much for them as they play 1@s response to 1@h as 5+|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead good    cutting off route to clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 7 was needed!|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like going 2 or 3 down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we can see all cards, but the club J makes 3 tricks difference|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as a heart lead now kills the clubs for -3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|ady: spade lead was best even into AQ  as long as north wins first round of clubs and plays a 2nd spade|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, this was souths only lead to give declarer a chance|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|junaid: this should lose 2@c, 1@s and 1@d|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: this a bit unlucky it seems|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||

pc|d4|nt|oosmanb: South should cash K@H before that exit, |pg||
nt|oosmanb: make life easier for N to cash out|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oosmanb: South could be caught on an endplay if North ducks this trick|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and if he overtakes he's himself endplayed|pg||

pc|dT|nt|oosmanb: -1|pg||
nt|yr: still down via uppercut|pg||
mc|9|nt|oosmanb: The 2@S bid caused problems for East. who couldnt bid 2NT anymore|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But I think the 2@D bid over 2@C cue caused the problem|pg||

nt|junaid: unlikely to get to game, but if S somehow manages to get there, he might very well make it on a @d lead|pg||
nt|yr: the other table also played 5@d & went down in 17 for a push|pg||
nt|yr: 14 i mean|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so good recovery, but spade switch gave it it seems|pg||
nt|ady: I got disconnected    but when J@C lost to the king  looked at best 7 tricks?|pg||
nt|ady: better of to have led the spade in 1st place|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: heart back at that point -3, even diamond -1, spade was just wrong|pg||
nt|yr: it looked all but over after the first 2 segments|pg||
nt|yr: with DS leading by some 50 imps|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just warming up nicely|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 1@h- (1NT) |pg||
nt|oosmanb: interesting from that point on :)|pg||
nt|junaid: i dont see why u wouldnt cash it, u can see the @ds controlled in your own hand and pard has clearly signalled for @s...but its not that clear at the table|pg||
nt|junaid: that board was a disaster for solox as well|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|oosmanb: i think K@C is crystal clear :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Candyland Vs Datasteel 15 - 44|pg||
nt|tipu: a lot will depend on   16 result|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: anyone for 4H :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: In any case you're not establishing a trick for declarer by cashing K@H and are unblocking yourself, so I just dont see how it loses|pg||
nt|junaid: yes it is...w/ the @s in dummy, u dont know if pard's entry is the A or K and your own holding is such that if u play @s before @d u may set up their tricks there and if play @d ...|pg||
nt|junaid: before u may set up tricks there|pg||
nt|junaid: entry is usually not the only issue going thru your mind and sometimes that makes u do funny things at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I like 4@H at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|junaid: yes, nice bid|pg||
nt|junaid: wonder what chandna is thinking|pg||
nt|oosmanb: In the other room South had a chance to bring this 3NT home but didnt take it |pg||
nt|junaid: they had a chance for a nice pickup, an opportunity missed|pg||
nt|yr: brd 17 is a plus position for solox,,,if they make 4@h they will gain 11 imps & we will have a new leader|pg||
nt|yr: they did,,,,,new leader! |pg||
mb|3H|nt|ehsana: 4H play should be interesting too :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4NT for minors??? Surely not|pg||
nt|yr: but 10 imps to them not 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely to play 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 hearts ok here it seems|pg||
mb|4H|nt|junaid: surely not about sacrificing...but surely not about dbling either:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: W seems just a touch frustrated after the last brd, expected the contract to go down more|pg||
nt|junaid: tricky board|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: this shd end the auction but u never know with umer at the helm|pg||
nt|junaid: lack of aces is the main problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 2NT asks 3 or 4@S I suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|ebrok: 4 sp i N-S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes spade lead gives the defence the tempo as it happens|pg||
nt|yr: yes pretty normal|pg||

pc|c3|nt|junaid: the turns out to be safe, if not dynamic:)|pg||

nt|yr: well, S goes for the safety of the 63 fit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ebrok: "Ø-W naturligvis|pg||
nt|kareno:  I would share his frustration.  The defense did not do well.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@c was 3@S. so they end up in 3NT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Better not lead a @D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oosmanb: Still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|junaid: but NS negotiate it extremely well...but the pass from N is very strange|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tipu: So do I |pg||
pc|h2|nt|junaid: both of making mistakes on the same lead...lol|pg||
nt|oosmanb: as long as West finds the switch|pg||
nt|ady: may have problems with 4-1 split|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tipu: @d 2 is asking @c|pg||
nt|yr: yes,,,defence was pretty ordinary actually,,,,,but by both of them :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: might be easier here since he can see dummies @h quality?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: The 9xx @D with East is stopping 3@D tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the clubs are tricky|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcwla: These auctions are a bit too courteous for me.|pg||
nt|yr: @s was the winning lead here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|nt|oosmanb: But notice that declarer can win 3@S tricks, by finessing the 10|pg||
nt|ady: will need to play clubs early    even losing a club ruff can still make|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c5|pc|hQ|nt|junaid: S was given a chance to make 3NT but he made a play that could not succeed...but by then he had to drop the stiff @d honor from W, still better hope than none|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can't really see why he should get them right|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|junaid: i would've thought it wud be very hard to keep him out of game now that he knows of the dbl fit as well as a shortness|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yes. over here, West wouldve gotten 1 more chance when in with Q@S|pg||
nt|junaid: yes, but w/ N as declarer, this switch is not so hard to find. at the other table W never switched to @h|pg||

nt|jcwla: 1NT rebid looks best after 1@S.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|oosmanb: 4@H again here inspite of @S ruff|pg||
nt|yr: Hasan askari showed a lot of restraint in 15 to play in 3@c & earn 6 imps for his team|pg||
mb|d|nt|oosmanb: 2@S was making here, so 3@H - 2 wont be that bad|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not sure where the +1 came from tho'|pg||
mb|1D|nt|junaid: wajahat and Kamal have played a lot together and they are a good pair, though they've been playing with different partners through this tourney|pg||
nt|oosmanb: What does W bid here? |pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3NT?|pg||
nt|ady: re all   had connection problem|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I like 1@S more than 2@S by North|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ehsana: now in 4H ..spade ruff a surety :)|pg||
nt|junaid: that:)|pg||
nt|yr: its pretty tempting to simply bid 3N or at least invite|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: wrong claim ojn the last board, the score will be adjusted. contract was 1nt-2|pg||
nt|junaid: 3NT unbeatable from S but down 2 on a @h lead from N|pg||
nt|yr: 11C is a bit old fasioned|pg||
nt|yr: 1@c|pg||
mb|2C|nt|junaid: dbl should be routine w/ 18 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: But perhaps 2@S now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: dubbelt?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: sure|pg||
nt|junaid: no other clear bid...clear case of the F word - Flexible|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I like K10x Of @S and AQ@d sitting over 2@s bid though|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: ponts equally distributed a part game struggle|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: not after 4@s though:)|pg||
nt|ehsana: $s is a doomed cntrct unless teh defenders wabt to prove me wrong :)|pg||
nt|farrukh: makes on @s lead only|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ehsana: 4S,,,|pg||
nt|ady: easy  3NT here|pg||
nt|junaid: and E should bid it too|pg||
nt|yr: the contract is reasonable though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oosmanb: But you dont know about @H fit so cant see source of tricks in 3NT.. Dbl seems best :)|pg||
nt|junaid: again u can see this is a new partnership...earlier N passed S's 1@c w/ a fit and an A and now S bids 1@s...they dont seem to be on the same plane|pg||
pc|h3|nt|junaid: solox could get lucky here for an 11imp pickup|pg||

nt|oosmanb: This was good for DS, Tullo opened 2@S @S + minor|pg||
nt|junaid: if they do, the 4@s going down is going to loom large on them|pg||
mb|1N|nt|farrukh: As they say down 1 is good bridge|pg||

nt|junaid: thats another good result for DS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 11 easy tricks in spades for e/w  and 12 if defence slip|pg||
nt|yr: sabres were the underdogs in this semi final,,,i must say they have played really well until now|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 16, where S played a quiet 5@C-1 here, the same contract was doubled and down 3 on a trump lead in the CR - hence an even bigger lead for DS.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ehsana: another possible 4H :):)|pg||
nt|junaid: but remember there must have been some carryover for solox, so sabres have outscored them in this match so far|pg||
nt|junaid: its what they call a plus position...if a swing occurs, it will be in the favour of DS...unless of course if something unusual happens|pg||

nt|tipu: here it comes 11 Imp's in Brd   16 for Sabers|pg||

nt|ady: 6 of either minor   but need luck with K@D singleton|pg||
mb|2S|nt|junaid: game in either black suit on for EW|pg||
nt|junaid: but it may get passed out in 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: right, neither does @d through work for an extra trick|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcwla: Matter of agreement - would expect it to be forcing one round for many or most.|pg||

nt|junaid: even 6@c is a good sc|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can save at the 6 level for 500|pg||

nt|vugraphzaa: vi gör ett hopp bland brickorna för att få in lite resultat från slutna|pg||
nt|junaid: that play is almost impossible to find on the table auction...unless S reverses, W will not have the inspiration to defend it that way|pg||
nt|ehsana: some mess up on this brd is being sorted out |pg||
nt|vugraphzar: the hands as i can see are the opposite on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: E has W's cards and N has S's|pg||
nt|junaid: was this bd played at the other table? maybe it got reversed there...or maybe the dealing machine fouled it up|pg||
nt|yr: anther 3N here NS|pg||
nt|junaid: certainly looks like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: så får vi sammenligninger igen, når vi vender tilbage til spil 15|pg||
nt|oosmanb: finally some points for NS :)|pg||
nt|junaid: 4@h was cold on the lie of the cards on 33|pg||
nt|ehsana: pass 14 ponts|pg||
nt|junaid: is that pass correct Qasim?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: let me check some thing wrong here|pg||
nt|junaid: on 30 3NT proved too difficult to beat after a @d lead...W needs to bang down the @hA to beat it when he wins the @cA|pg||
nt|yr: maybe 5@d|pg||
nt|yr: what a final we are having , exciting stuff|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yr: but 3N more likely|pg||
nt|kareno:  3nt more likelu|pg||
nt|junaid: solox picked up anoter 11 imps on board 30|pg||
nt|ady: likely to be same contract as CR     12 tricks though is more than expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S should make e/w|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kareno:  likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: should not have a problem getting to game|pg||
nt|yr: yes Karen:)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 6@D? |pg||
nt|yr: 2N3N|pg||
nt|yr: E needed to get his @ss in|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ehsana: 3nt  hopefully not over bid :) by E/W|pg||
nt|ehsana: ..sryyyyyyyyy N/S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@D is very decent  I think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not making here..|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 4@H      hav e to play more carefully|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, I dont think the contract will be the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Det er blevet et populært interval, 10-13|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Der må væfre en årsag, det må jeg ha' studeret|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk3: Fantunes bruger det også|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: i Sverige kallas öppningen för Askeröd och är Arnes favoritkonvention|pg||
nt|ehsana: any slam will be hard work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: actually 6@d not that good|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: certainly 2@H and a diamond to lose in 4@H   and 4-1 break awkward|pg||
nt|ajq: Heart lead can sink the contract|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yr: @h 10 id guess|pg||
nt|yr: as a lead knowing E|pg||
nt|yr: unnessary bid of 2N i think,,,even if S has raised on 3 @hs a 4@h bid is in order |pg||
mb|4C!|nt|junaid: well...it needs @ds to break for starters...and then either, if no @ds losers u need to hold @s losers to 1, and if a @d loser then u have to play @ss for no losers...|pg||
nt|junaid: so dont think 6@d is such a hot contract|pg||
nt|yr: there it is!|pg||
nt|kareno:  Time for tea ... (_)?  ... and cookies ... OOOO|pg||
mb|d|nt|oosmanb: yup|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|yr: yeah sure|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so sorry, I was still on the last hand|pg||
nt|yr: there is NO slam opposite a 12-14 opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: however much hotter than 6@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Im surprised norths messing about here, he has an obvious 4 hearts over 2 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: this NS p'ship was very good in the RR but we're now beginning to see problems|pg||
nt|junaid: ouch...thats a big bid facing shortness|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ehsana: scoop S10 6S may make :)|pg||
nt|junaid: the lack of partnership understanding is clear...bd 13 and now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Well I can see the problem|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its whether you play checkback here or not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and what the implies about 3@S |pg||
nt|ady: I see the 6@D was a swing to Solox    5@D played in CR|pg||
nt|yr: Exactly, Tony|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: accident here      bad score for Sabres|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Declarer has a wry smile, seeing the dummy lay down|pg||
nt|junaid: its all his own doing imo|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|yr: well!!!@he has slam ambitions!!|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahlnil0: Arne är dessutom från Askeröd :)|pg||
nt|ady: would have been better had east opened 2@S    surely they would have played 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yr: thats a bit strange,,,,id play another @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: & lands in a precarious 5@h|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: its a close match now it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lucky not to lose here|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

pc|h2|nt|junaid: finally, u get to see EW do something well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk3: är det i Skåne?|pg||

nt|ahlnil0: Ja ett litet samhälle |pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|yr: so declarer sails home|pg||
nt|kareno:  That ten of hearts was surely from a short suit - so try another suit|pg||
nt|ady: also 12 tricks|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||

nt|junaid: 23 another good result for DS|pg||
nt|junaid: in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: yeah,,,but the point was that W held  a good hand so E cant have enough entries to establish & cash winners in a new suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk3: Sidste 12 spil i weekenden|pg||
nt|junaid: but solox may get pushed there similarly|pg||
nt|ady: duplication in hearts    but diamonds lay well so 4@S makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzar: And i can see he is too much disappointed now .|pg||
mb|2H|nt|junaid: alright alright, i'll lower my expectations...lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 6@D makeable on inspired play... instead of finessing Q,, you can play @S to K and then Jack.. pinning doubleton 10 and promoting 9|pg||
nt|ehsana: 9tricks in spades |pg||
nt|kareno:  1nt by north I think, whether he opens it or rebids it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|junaid: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: There's a theory that says.. in computer deals.. if you're in a "bad" slam... its usually still makeable but on antipercentage plays usually|pg||
nt|junaid: wow|pg||
nt|junaid: pass by E amazing|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: NS bid rather agressively to a failing game contract in the other room so a pickup for Solox likely here|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk3: 7@C og ingen dobling fra Willquist :)|pg||

nt|junaid: what can E have for his 5@h bid? |pg||
nt|junaid: W had to take a shot at slam imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: West just lays the cards down in style. Not saying a word, and claiming the rest |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ehsana: probably over reached again |pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oosmanb: 3NT struggles too|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk3: Det er ganske vist rigtigt, at ØV har en renonce, men det er Øst, og det er i trumf :)|pg||
nt|junaid: if W can bid 4@d, can he try 3NT on the way? he's already passed 3@d once |pg||
pc|h8|nt|kareno:  Aggressive is an understatement!|pg||
nt|ady: only 11 tricks last hand scored|pg||

pc|hK|nt|yr: absolutely!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, the 5 diamonds lucky to be undoubled|pg||
pc|hA|nt|junaid: a good reason is that holding a wk hand, its quite often a good move to start w/ your 4 card suit because u're more likely to find help from partner there|pg||
