nt|sybarra: hello Stephen and all |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ayrshirebridge.co.uk/|pg||
nt|toobad: another|pg||
nt|dburn: London buses, these - you wait all day for a slam, then three come along at once|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a bit of a 5 or 7 deal on a @s lead|pg||
nt|mamos: mmmmm|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but in six you might cash two clubs and play hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  except the doubleton @dQ may come to the rescue|pg||
nt|dburn: perecentages not at all easy to calculate|pg||
nt|mamos: have you got an envelope handy David?|pg||
nt|dburn: though certainly you should not neglect the extra chance in diamonds, so not a "true" five or seven hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  must have got the clubs wrong at the other table|pg||
nt|toobad: You seem to have drawn the short straw with your connection Stephen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mamos: hi all|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: back to spelling classes...|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks for catching up|pg||
nt|dburn: not surprising, perhaps, in view of weak 2@s opening by South|pg||
nt|toobad: the thing to do, if you are only in 5!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  midly surprised that East did not add on a point for the 10-9 of @h |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  for results|pg||
nt|idc: Stephen is our operator, network troubleshooter & parttime commentator|pg||
nt|idc: a man of many talents|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: mmm...|pg||
nt|idc: I see East rather panicked in 3NT last hand, played @d from hand and went one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: play lost in connection error|pg||
nt|mamos: 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|toobad: a quiet pass by west|pg||
nt|mamos: EW seem to have been too passive here|pg||
nt|sybarra: West not a fun hand to lead from |pg||
nt|mamos: and are maybe a bit lucky that game is not making their way|pg||
nt|toobad: d would be good, but prob AS|pg||
nt|mamos: as it happens West  cannot do much harm |pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: W will be endplayed a lot on this hand|pg||
nt|toobad: great start for defence|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|dburn: still, no one will bid a slam now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a poor contract|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it does have the merit of nine on top|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: well...it does have 9 top tricks :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  unfortunate :(|pg||

nt|idc: Hard to see this one not being flat as well|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round there will be a long break for dinner. Restart at 20.00 local time, in about 3 hours and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have a lot of high cards but poor shape and two top @d losers|pg||
nt|mamos: bet you didnt expect @d9 to win last trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability is going to make this board less interesting than it might|pg||
nt|dburn: one thing about these players - they have a refreshing attitude towards getting on with the game|pg||
nt|idc: v 4@h North needs to switch to @d at trick 2, continued @c in OR and declarer had 10|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - we should be finished in time to watch the highlights of the 1st world cup game|pg||
nt|toobad: no time penalties!|pg||
nt|toobad: lightening play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does other room result look right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|toobad: sounds good Guthi|pg||
nt|idc: A point of technique on this hand:|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT agrees spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks goofy |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|idc: in 4@s on say trump or @h or @c lead: draw trump, eliminate side suits finishing in dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  card also says that 2NT shows slam interest - maybe West thought he was not good enough |pg||
nt|idc: then a @d to Q and claim - South endplayed even if they began with AK @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  true - but most of the time South has dxA-K he will lead one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dA-K|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: seems to think he has now :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|idc: Of course, they might have led one from @dAK, but no reason not to play it properly :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Do not understand this bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|toobad: n might pass this, nope|pg||
nt|mamos: oh its the terrorist 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North will need to switch to a @d at trick two to stop the overtrick|pg||
nt|idc: spotlight on North then...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  results |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: Many players go through this stage in their bridge careers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is hoping for a 6th @s but optimistic even then|pg||
nt|idc: Lose patience on potential slam hand and use Blackwood |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West should have responded 2NT and so not felt the need to take control later|pg||
nt|dburn: chance for Northern Ireland - right defence not all that far-fetched|pg||
nt|sybarra: lebs |pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: Yes, the 2@c bid left them stuck a little over 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: West is worth no more than a "sound raise " to 4@S  some pairs play 3NT shows this sort of hand as  response to 1M|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: declarer not looking too aghast...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: not overtrick - for the contract|pg||
nt|dburn: and it might even stop the contract|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mamos: Jones's 2@C shows a weak hand without Clubs |pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: i think they said it was minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and includes one major?|pg||
nt|mamos: or with Clubs or something|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  three rounds of clubs at other table too|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about that @c8 - seemed to be a half-way house between shwoing count and discouraging|pg||
nt|dburn: but a more usual attitude @c5 might have got the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  foul @d split here|pg||
nt|idc: if playing attitude perhaps she thought @cT might have suit preference overtones|pg||
nt|idc: sorry, meant reverse attitude|pg||
nt|dburn: if playing attitude, your cards do not have "suit preference overtones" - this isn't Humpty Dumpty bridge|pg||
nt|idc: just discouraging with 5 clearly best if normal attitude|pg||
nt|idc: it is if I say it is!|pg||
nt|toobad: Scotland on a roll|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: OK ...Let's hope connection holds up a little now :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  East was probably wondering whether West is showing a hand too good to open 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks Stephen - a slight overbid then if GF|pg||
nt|idc: In the other room, SOuth led @s2 v 3NT, and North put in @s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only 8 tricks in view (and that is with @h 3-3)|pg||
nt|idc: so the 10 won trick one|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: Any thoughts on North's dbl?   I quite like it opposite a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the right shape certianly|pg||
nt|dburn: don't mind it at these colours, but might tip declarer to a line he would not otherwise find|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|dburn: still, it's a bidders' game, and North-South certainly play it that way|pg||
nt|mamos: might misplace @SK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: The English EW  are both experienced and perhaps less "excitable" than many JUniors  Id expect a reasonably steady performance from them|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes = declarer needs to duck the 1st @s really|pg||
pc|c4|nt|toobad: should be 2 off |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: could very well do|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South dozing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: Robertson may make this   but even 1 off will be a couple of imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  double dummy I can see how to make it: knock out the @hA, cash @h/@c winners and exit with 3rd @d|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - declarer wasn't going to run the four, although he would have made some kind of history if he had|pg||
pc|d6|nt|idc: A guess declarer may be able to put pressure on North, who is holding most of the defensive values|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is leading twice towards the hearts in case North has A-x|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: close to making but 1 off seems right |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to duck a spade to North to keep an entry|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|toobad: if he runs 10c he will make it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: still, maybe he should have done - four diamonds, three hearts, one of each black suit...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|idc: All eggs in 3-3 @c split basket, not that I can blame West for that|pg||
nt|idc: hmm, North should have covered that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would have been better to play second heart here|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but he needed more time and more entries than he had to set those up|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: and very pretty - well done West (if he does it)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  N needed to play more quickly here|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a kind of three-suit strip squeeze without the count|pg||
nt|idc: yes, when you are going to be under pressure best to plan early so you can make crucial discard smoothly|pg||
nt|dburn: and one of these days, I expect to see a full discussion of the topic by Julian Pottage|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  mind you - once South turns up with the @sK North's shape becomes pretty well marked|pg||

nt|mamos: ive goy about 5 tricks thats half way and partner has 15 +  |pg||
nt|mamos: wow the hand shave been enormous in this set|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@h looks rather better than 6NT|pg||
nt|dburn: seems odd that the score should be only 7-3 - these boards have had the potential for it to be 47-43|pg||
nt|fifee: hi John|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike Amos, left us to carve the sunday dinner (left us no menu) |pg||

nt|skorchev: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: some difference in the speed of this and the Camrose|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  mind you - 12 on top in both thanks to the @dJ|pg||
nt|vbman: yes it must be an end of a period of time so they are even tired maybe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: wont take long to complete the round|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 1@s 1@h 2@d 2@c to lose|pg||
nt|mamos: Becky not prepared to sell out to 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: s would love to defend s here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  double is presumably a game try|pg||
nt|idc: I like to play that as a game-try dbl, I do hope N-S don't|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: not alerted but presumably a game try|pg||
nt|dburn: why - can they beat three hearts?|pg||
nt|mamos: i was wondering if it was alerted but remembered that its EBL regs|pg||
nt|skorchev: yeah, furthermore all teams are 4-handed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: why does s not push vul opps|pg||
mb|2N|nt|toobad: s should be bidding 3c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he knows n is almost certainly void in s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Stephen Peterkin, welcome to you too|pg||
nt|vbman: what about that 2sp anyone?|pg||
nt|skorchev: too aggressive :)|pg||
nt|vbman: but shuts the h suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: come to that, can they beat four hearts?|pg||
nt|idc: Take your point David but I was worrying that any pair who think South has a game try|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: no doubles alertable in Scotland...|pg||
nt|idc: may also think North has an accept :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not "on top" - suppose East led his singleton spade against 6@h|pg||
nt|idc: even the 3rd best slam, 6@s, should be ok|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the best contract is six hearts by South, but that might be a bit difficult to organise|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  @h lead best as cards lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but West may score a @c ruff to make up the club trick lost on the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: @CQ   is an interesting lead|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the -2 in OR came when South didn't have trump control to set up a long club trick|pg||
nt|dburn: he may, but this lead may also have lost a tempo - declarer would have problems keeping control on a heart lead|pg||
nt|mamos: (is fearless the code?)|pg||
nt|idc: whereas this lead should give him that, so perhaps -2 for a flat board|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a likely push |pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: i wd ask her if she overcalled for the single h|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: just pesky that spades are 4/1|pg||
nt|toobad: not under enough pressure in 2... 3 would have been more interesting|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: @cQ would have worked better|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: make a lot of tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: played by North, this might be closer to a five or seven deal than the previous candidate|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that West did not double 5@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is trying to work out whether 6@c shows no kings or the @cK?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: good catch - I suspect that he was asleep (understandably given the hour)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 5NT asks for Kings  odd time for \south to be thinking|pg||
nt|toobad: i think they are all just v tired|pg||
nt|toobad: 7 now!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  given how quickly they play, it would have been possible to arrange the schedule for an earlier finish |pg||
nt|dburn: seven? if North believes South's bidding, she should bid at least eight|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: and ew will almost certainly bid 3d|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamonds plays well for East  -- and a heck of a lot better thaN @s|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: not ridiculous to try for game with the South cards - those kings look well placed (though one of them isn't)|pg||
nt|toobad: wow|pg||
nt|mamos: it is exhausting watching Junior bridge emotions fluctuate wildly  brilliance turns to idiocy and then back again in a twinkling  |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  anyone who has been following the snooker, it is heading for a last frame decider between Selby and Maguire - not that we want to stop you from watching here :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|mamos: THOUGH THIS IS NOT SO GOOD|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East did well to read the lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: East could just have tried to cash top cards because North had to ruff with winners|pg||
nt|toobad: good to see Richard thinking about best defence|pg||
nt|idc: except for 'brilliance' you could be talking about any of my games|pg||
nt|vbman: akd, k, d maybe thinking cl king is on|pg||
nt|skorchev: she was doubleton @H|pg||
nt|vbman: by the way 3h looks cold to me|pg||
nt|vbman: oh true|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|idc: Well, no UCB 2@d by partner, so it is a little pushy|pg||
nt|dburn: facing three trumps to the queen and clubs headed by A10 or K10, game would have reasonable play|pg||
nt|dburn: so trying for game is only mildly fearless|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  considering what some people overcall on non-vul these days South was hugely better than he might be|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: though in fact trump was best|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: perhaps need to be a bit careful |pg||

nt|idc: If you have a penalty dbl of 3NT, I think you also have one of 4@c|pg||
nt|mamos: in a way the result does suggest that South was hopelessly over optimistic|pg||

pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  with the hearts blocked, it looks like declarer can even afford a diamond loser|pg||
nt|idc: I like that: both sides wanted to play in 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North-South had been allowed to play 3NT, they would on best defence have achieved an above-par result of minus 600|pg||
nt|dburn: good bid|pg||

nt|skorchev: it's a good game because there is no duplication in @S|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|dburn: I suppose you could implement a system like they have in tennis - three undos per set|pg||
nt|vbman: the great shuffler is at work|pg||
mb|1H|nt|toobad: slam not easy on a h lead|pg||
nt|dburn: rather less bidding than one might expect at the other table|pg||
nt|sybarra: little imps as we say |pg||
nt|sybarra: but it could well matter|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mamos: i wonder if declarer thought about those little Hearts  5 was lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed but good fun to play|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wales did well there|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont agree with either of those two calls|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed they did, and who knows - playing penalty doubles of 1@h might work well for them here also|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  not a fan of canape openings either |pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: explained as Jump fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 1NT or pass are reasonable for East but not double|pg||

nt|jcomyn: what will s do if n bids 3h|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont mind canape openings in some situations but thats a really good six card suit and a hopeless five card one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this has no chance|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 4@H is  /&%¤ !!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 5@H is ............................|pg||
nt|dburn: no doubt North thought South's 3@d implied a heart fit|pg||
nt|dburn: and still thinks so|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: got a little out of control....|pg||
nt|dburn: Robson and Segal's book ought not to be allowed to be read by people under 25|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East might find a double here but is trying to avoid doing with with undue haste|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: N thinks jump fit...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: 2 @C was stretching my imagination  (even with the new systems)|pg||
nt|toobad: We might be in for a tense finish............. always a good thing|pg||
mb|5D|nt|idc: tennis is a dangerous game for bridge to ape: Brits never win anything|pg||
nt|sybarra: BBO seems to specialize in those |pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|idc: As long as East started with two ir more red cards in her box .. phew|pg||
nt|dburn: and not very many people over it, either|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mamos: East probably checking the colour of the backs of her cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  not very sincere 'thank you partner'|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I suppose South does have a sort of fit jump - he has 4-4 in the red suits; the trouble is that both red suits are diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|nt|idc: indeed|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: u most certainly do and i agree a lot of senior players x|pg||

nt|toobad: v well played|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: the we didnt come herer to pass brikgade|pg||
nt|toobad: or they bid a filthy 2c lol|pg||
nt|mamos: I do think double is completely wrong  - Pass is fine  - even 2@C  but double will shows 4 Hearts in my (humble!!) opinion  and more Diamonds and just asks for trouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is heading to a nasty score for ireland|pg||
nt|mamos: I bet  NOrth wishes hed bid the filthy 2@C  then he'd be playing it rather than North in a filthy 3@d|pg||
nt|toobad: as the cards ly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i couldnt agree more about a x of spades. it MUST show hearts|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  I can see that a partnership between Marc Smith and David is not about to happen - Marc loves raising with three|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 11 and 12 have yet to be scored, and Northern Ireland have about 20 IMPs worth of plus positions in those|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: for allowing us to bring you the vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|toobad: will N bid 2S?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hope EW do not have the misunderstaning about whether this is a fit jump that we saw earlier|pg||
nt|idc: BGB and their representative Sandra Claridge and Fiona Abbott the Match|pg||
nt|mamos: is there a chance of beating  game here?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: there will be a break after this deal |pg||
nt|skorchev: 5 min break or?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: and as always, BBO itself and you specs for turning up and putting up with myself & fellow commentators|pg||

nt|mamos: why didnt she just bid 3NT?|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  wish I knew|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphb1: a cigarette break|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|idc: but it has made for an exciting match for us watching|pg||

nt|Walddk5: I can understand her way of thinking. Two empty suits, she was scared of notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it must be frustrating for the npcs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they see what the piars can do in practice matches but when it comes to the real thing...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are very inexperienced and playing in front of 500+ specs is pressure|pg||
nt|dburn: good grief|pg||
nt|idc: Manager for the Scottish Bridge Union for letting us cover the event.|pg||
nt|idc: And to my fellow commentators, David, Julian and Mike.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: E unsure about 2@H|pg||
nt|skorchev: wow, what a bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, it might make - South leads a spade, North plays the king, East drops @cQ, etc|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure how they will defeat this|pg||

nt|toobad: they have my full confidence|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expecting 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|mamos: well Scotland have one more match in hand so something like 21-9 or more to Scotland will leave things pretty level|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mamos: but if England win or hold their own they certainly will be in a strong position|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|toobad: they only made 11 in the other room on 8 too........ 12 not easy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: lucky break in trumps. always 4-1 when i bid this one|pg||
nt|mamos: 2Nt is probably the value bid but West would surely bid game|pg||
nt|toobad: assuming Scotland get 25 from their match in hand|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure 4@h is right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: oh dear|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sybarra: not sure you shouldnt let pard play 3 nt |pg||
nt|mamos: Diamond leads may leave declarer struggling|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|mamos: this should make s!A was oinside  but  the opening lead will make declarer feel more comfortable|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  slightly surprised that West did not open 2NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not that 2NT is a great bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with diamonds 3-2 and the king onside, this has play|pg||
nt|mamos: @DK onside but 4-1 trumps will be too much|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  entry situation dictates ruffing hearts rather than clubs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer may ruff third heart high and lose a trump trick|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Wales have a complete dearth of juniors such that they have had to make an U25 side out of their U25s and U20s. Accordingly, no Wales in the Peggy Bayer (U20)|pg||
nt|idc: That explains the enquiry from East then|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am not sure whether this pair could play in U20s|pg||
nt|idc: for many Juniors, an 11 count is an average strength 1 opening :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Harris-Richards could play U20s this year|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  for results|pg||
nt|idc: I guess West is thinking of coming again, holding 6-4 shape|pg||
nt|idc: looks like both 4@s and 5@d are making too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think it must be a connection problem|pg||
nt|idc: I used to have partners with connection problems - between their bids and their actual hands|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West may have been thinking but not this long|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: 1 @H=3 hts usually|pg||

nt|toobad: i'm coaching for Lady Milne and one of them overcalled a worse suit than that 2 weeks ago|pg||
nt|dburn: is his Dad allowed to play in the Junior Camrose?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  With a full 15 HCP outside of clubs, West should insist on a slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told that I was wrong,  could well be dblton or fewer |pg||
nt|mamos: Pass loks a little odd nonetheless|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  East is a little mystifed as he is looking at the @sQ|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is presumably trying to show extras|pg||
nt|idc: indeed, I expect West has shown the @sQ and East is wondering if two Queens of @s will threaten slam|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|idc: You may have heard the expression "duplication of values" - I guess both E & W having @sQ counts as that|pg||

nt|lestergold: this is feeble|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stewball: ,,dont care for S's evaluation,,maybe easier if N bid @hs|pg||
nt|stewball: but S has a huge hand on this auction|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not convinced this is the moment for the Moysian|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surely 2NT would show a hand too weak to open 1NT on EW system|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s seems silly|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: 2@S is slightly silly...if strong NT 2NT has to be allowed to be this...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jbgood: clubs behave, so just a matter of overtrick|pg||

nt|toobad: same horrible 2H bid at both tables|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: 12 tricks is alot|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: close 3n avaialble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a very good result for the English EW|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|sybarra: might be right Mike, but some times you bid and somedays its right|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: W might bid 6@H now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  I would have doubled as South|pg||
nt|toobad: another 3N from NS|pg||
mb|6H|nt|lestergold: with n/s the intermnediates make 3n a fair contract|pg||
nt|stewball: well the good thing about being junior is that they have lots of time to get better|pg||
nt|lestergold: norh has a very good 14 worth an upgrade?|pg||
nt|stewball: and these hands have been pretty instructive for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 31 combined only 10 tricks available tho|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|mamos: im sure thats true its what you do  but perhaps you shouldnt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  less certainty that 2@h is six |pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  more sensible contract than the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Ha! No danger of 12 here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with clubs 2-2, 4@s doubled is down only one|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|toobad: 4S is very frisky bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: amazed that East didnt express an opinion about 4@h in OR|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, South had a tough lead at the other table|pg||
nt|toobad: oops|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bessi2: 5@d is the best spot but nearly impossible to bid|pg||
nt|nicksan: And they may well double their lead here. Not sure where the 10th trick came from in CR|pg||
nt|lestergold: just total overbidding|pg||
nt|toobad: nees jc lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suppose north was worth a quantitative try on thier methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: but no more|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a lot of chances for this one|pg||
mc|12|nt|galadriel: agreed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even @cAx in East not enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky spades 3/3 for the tenth trick!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand a good exmaple of how unreliable point count is when hands are so duplicated|pg||
nt|toobad: nice safe lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: poor old NS can't be enjoying this|pg||

nt|mamos: but good result for NI in Or here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does anyone know the link to show the running scores?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tough for NS to flatten this result|pg||

nt|toobad: bidding and play|pg||
nt|toobad: once the wheels come off, it destroys confidence, especially in the very young|pg||

nt|mamos: 2@d  must show something like limit in Clubs|pg||
mb|r|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: at least this board should be a breather|pg||
nt|lestergold: careful Mike bidding isnt finished|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it ought to be|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: interesting - but this should make|pg||
nt|nicksan: Lovely, something different! Should make, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|nicksan: What's that, 560?|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: 560, yes|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  what do we think 2@d is?|pg||
nt|mamos: well  it seems to have worked what ever it meant  -- a bit of a mystery to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: well indeed but what ought here isnt always what is|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Surely North is worth a further move? But slam is very marginal|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: N slightly good for a splinter ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: did S have to bid?|pg||
nt|stewball: no|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: seer what i mean|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2N bid is complete tilt|pg||
nt|toobad: as an npc its important to lift them when this sort of set happens|pg||
nt|stewball: sometimes W pulls this|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would wrigglke into a suit contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what did 2@c mean here over the double|pg||
mb|4C|nt|toobad: home now |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a criss-cross raise?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: there were some conection problems and we had to restart the broadcast so now the result is not correct|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: there are 2 board untill the end |pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: good switch|pg||
nt|mamos: from the fact that West bid 3NT  I suspect 2@d showed a better hand than East really had|pg||
nt|toobad: entry problems now to set up 2nd spade|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  system cad says weak jump shifts at the two level|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: We can see that Boye can make two tricks in each suit, but things can happen. |pg||
nt|toobad: it has happened to us all at some sort ofv level|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I do not know the exact score .. |pg||
nt|anton72: 28 for Bolero|pg||
mb|d|nt|nicksan: Probably, East's best chance is a small diamond shift  (!)|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think Boye would sniff tha out|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner asked for a heart lead whu club|pg||
nt|lestergold: dummy's lovely spades destined for the skip|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: If you count the @cK maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: that must be majors I think Julian|pg||
nt|stewball: stayman apparently|pg||
nt|anton72: was 12 imps for Bonsist last one|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: it was +40 for Bolero now they lost 12 in board 18 so it is around 28 imps for bolero|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: but I agree  the 2 @D has to be something speical|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  found it now - limit raise with 4+@c|pg||
nt|toobad: wd Julian.......... top research!! lol|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so it is a criss-cross raise - very rare over this side of the pond|pg||
