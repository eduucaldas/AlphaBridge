mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: to see the auction from the othe room, point your mouse over the Closed Room result  |pg||
nt|davidstern: Double by East?|pg||
nt|psridhar: why should they bid up to 2N|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|psridhar: defend 2@h|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would prefer double by East than 1@S gets it all off your chest in one go|pg||

nt|lestergold: or a club duck as pointed out by spec|pg||
nt|lestergold: what fun and games arfe we in for here?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of man?|pg||
nt|lestergold: my prediction is that someone will go off in a high level major suit contract|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps @ds by s after 1@h 2nt?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing plays well |pg||
nt|sybarra: above the 2 level or so|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we here? or losing connex |pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Vlad :) |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h is a reasonable contract for e/w only needs 3/2 trumps and find Q@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pretty bad suits for a vul unusual nt though.|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Shirley :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi Vladimir|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: hello Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: not with a gun to my head do i bid 2n at these colours with 2 playing tricks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: a pretty scary 2N|pg||
nt|lestergold: bonkers|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and that was just the bid that S wanted to hear |pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south says why bid my known 8 card fit when i will probaBLY BUY A LOW SINGLETON IN MY SUIT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: I think I would bid 3@d intending to bid 3@S over 3@h.|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has had enough |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well so far my prediction looks corfrect|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: 2N shows the minors, Joe?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (But I would expect more from pd.)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's the theory.|pg||
nt|lestergold: auctio0n called for a trump lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: why is west trying to help declarer set up a suit?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|xenya: indeed -- at least for a trump switch -- E must be well equipped in the minors for his double|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d9|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: dont beed tio see dummy on that auction a trump would have beem out of my hand at the speed of light|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|am007: little too ambitious|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: really?|pg||
nt|xenya: so the defence seems to have thrown 2 tricks here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|santyclz: The auction called for a trump lead.  In addition, the more unbalanced opening leader's hand is, the more the trump lead is appropriate.  0 for 2.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: you can read north's distribution on the auction and you know that hearts will be ruffed in dummy|pg||

nt|mdgraham: good phrase, that - "unorthodox methods"|pg||
nt|psridhar: well, thats as polite as i could get |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it can be a good tactic to raise a pre-empt on a singleton sometimes. The enemy will misestimate each other's length,and you won't get doubled |pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: declarer might hv tried setting up his Dia earlier and made it easily|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but at 24 down maybe you should play for swings if you think they will be in 4@S in the other room as well  |pg||

mc|8|nt|mdgraham: but that sort of thing is difficult to judge - the opps have staggered into 4@s, and with a singleton in South there is a good chance of a bad trump break  |pg||
