mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@D will probably talk Greco out of leading that suit -- so 5@S will probably make [if vP doesn't get excited by @C void]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: We thought they'd change the lineup here so there would be one slow and one fast at each table, but they didn't (Schwartz had seed this 1/4)|pg||
