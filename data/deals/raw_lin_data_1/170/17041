nt|junaid: does this score include the carryover as well|pg||
nt|junaid: and does anyone know how much it was to begin with?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: this includes the carry over|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: and this segment is like the 7th game of tennis set...candyland have to make some inroads, they cant afford to fall too far back|pg||
nt|ehsana: Tehsin plays for Data steel|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|junaid: looks like a misundertanding right off the bat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: to me seems a difficult brd for both teams..anything can happen...declarer will face problems|pg||
nt|ady: west pass?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|junaid: please remember that NS are a first time partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: a pretty light overcall by TM but thats his style and it has worked for him often enough|pg||
mb|d|nt|junaid: and his partner should be surprised to find him w/ this hand|pg||
nt|junaid: should NOT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|junaid: works out well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ehsana: 2Nt may end up in the red :)|pg||

nt|ebrok: men spar ud er også 9 stik. |pg||
nt|junaid: and a correct @c guess would even allow him to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|junaid: this could turn into an 11imp pickup for sabres|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ehsana: any bets on 4S by East:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|oosmanb: Surely cant be namyats, if South has AK@H... |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: But I guess if you agreed on a convention and it comes your way, you trust it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand   e/w 3@C|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|ehsana: 5D on too|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead should beat it and w/ trump control, TM will likely find the lead and then finding entry in N hand is not a matter of choice, only one option|pg||
nt|ehsana: 5D playable cntrct|pg||
pc|d3|nt|junaid: nothing else makes sense...also, has no one every opened namyats missing the AK of trumps?|pg||

nt|junaid: even then, E can bank on @hs for @c pitches after 2 rounds of trumps...interesting play problem|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|oosmanb: However  NS might get lucky, since 4@S nor 5@C makes on the last board, on correct defence|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ehsana: 4H by East ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|junaid: this should be a routine 4@h contract|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT  also look likely to make|pg||
nt|ady: can take 13 tricks on good heart view|pg||
mb|3D|nt|oosmanb: 4 of either major seems fine|pg||
nt|ehsana: a major game for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 4S will be take n to teh Cleaners |pg||

mb|4D|nt|junaid: S hand tailor made for walsh, showing 4441 GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: strange double|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: S asked W if 4@h was weak|pg||
mb|4S|nt|junaid: it would've ended up going to the cleaners if EW dbled, but that is not a clear at the table action|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: 3@d inquired about, alerted as natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Kommer att gå hem i 4@S också när klövermasken ordnar sig|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ehsana: my humble opinion 4S bettr than 4H :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|junaid: even now they seem to be on their way to 6m...needs luck, but its there, minors breaking and one of the two red hooks on|pg||

nt|golfergolf: so 5@D?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ehsana: ,,,,,2NT by N was the bid which could find the slam way|pg||

nt|ehsana: any slam will be hard work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: actually 6@d not that good|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: certainly 2@H and a diamond to lose in 4@H   and 4-1 break awkward|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|junaid: well...it needs @ds to break for starters...and then either, if no @ds losers u need to hold @s losers to 1, and if a @d loser then u have to play @ss for no losers...|pg||
nt|junaid: so dont think 6@d is such a hot contract|pg||
mb|5C|nt|oosmanb: yup|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: however much hotter than 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: this NS p'ship was very good in the RR but we're now beginning to see problems|pg||
nt|junaid: ouch...thats a big bid facing shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: scoop S10 6S may make :)|pg||
nt|junaid: the lack of partnership understanding is clear...bd 13 and now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Well I can see the problem|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its whether you play checkback here or not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and what the implies about 3@S |pg||
