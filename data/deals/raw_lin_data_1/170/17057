mb|p|nt|leao: looking at Jxx in @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: He has some help in clubs, so 3NT is not a worry. North has to calculate whether 6@D is possible. He decides it is not worth a further move.|pg||

nt|henryb:  I think 4@s is dangerous: partner may play you for 3-4-5-1 distribution|pg||

nt|henryb:  afraid of showing 5-6 perhaps?|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok i am told 4@D was keycard|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: No, as I understood at the table, 4@s was a cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: north can't really ask for keycards with no club control|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: They both explained that 4@h would have been keycard|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: If you put your cursor over the Closed Room result, you can see the bidding at the other table.|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d2|nt|joest: I'm a little surprised that Cayne sold out to 3@d here.  Even though partner might have rejected his game try, 5-5 is usually enough distribution for a 'law' violation|pg||
nt|leao: but EW bought the contract, thanks to Dorsi choice of opening bid|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|leao: hello|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has two options over 3@D with a weak hand: he could pass or bid 3@S. Presumably Pass was the weaker of the options, the way they play.|pg||

pc|h8|pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: I have always thought it better to open 1@C with 4-4 in the minors, but most US bridge teachers prefer 1@D (for some reason).|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|joest: it's interesting theoretically whether you can 'unforce' yourself.  had east passed, north-south were bound to play at least three spades|pg||

nt|leao: he plans on making 2 @c tricks|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|brolucius: It seems a bit strange to allow E/W to choose trumps at the three-level when you have already made a game-try in spades.|pg||
