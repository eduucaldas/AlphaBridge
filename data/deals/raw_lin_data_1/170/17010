mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: the play in 6@s is not quite clear after a trumph lead. 6@d is easier|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chick: trump and trump continuation after a club forces the heart finesse, but it works|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Declarer has to chose between setting up the @h or finess in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't understand why you want to show 6 of your cards rather than at least 9 (2@D)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: or if East plays @h to the ace and a heart ruff, he has enough entries to handle the hearts 4-2 :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Whu play on that @dJ will drop? isn´t the finess for @dJ another chance?|pg||
