nt|psridhar: @d lead and 1c shift wd hv beaten|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|mb|3N|nt|nkgupt: a phantom in OR|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|psridhar: i wonder what was 2nt by tewari last hand? lebensohl showing @c or @d? if so 2@s showing both minors wd hv helped|pg||
mb|4D|nt|psridhar: Praba may even hv competed to 4@c making|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|henryb:  Declarer misguessed hearts (which may be technically right). In this room I think declarer has better chances|pg||
nt|psridhar: same phantom appeared here too - tough to avoid i guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  especially after this lead he may make an overtrick!|pg||
nt|psridhar: shows the power of leading an ACE in a preemptive auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: Surely @c king is the last card u expect in decl's hand?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is cold as long as @h are 4-3|pg||
nt|psridhar: with H king coming down in 3 rds it seems makeable yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: But decl may take the same @h finesse here too -to park his @s 'loser' |pg||

pc|d7|pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|henryb:  For what it is worth, there are good methods over Michaels: a free bid of the fourth suit (the other minor) or a raise of partner is constructive but not forcing|pg||

pc|d5|pc|h2|nt|psridhar: this looks d1|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|henryb:  The two cue bids: 2@h and 2@s show respectively a forcing hand in the other major and a forcing hand in partner's minor|pg||
nt|psridhar: see the diff in hand evaluation between the two Souths- here he didnt bid at 2 lev; other room he bid at 3 level :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  other minor, sorry|pg||
nt|psridhar: this individual diff is one of the things that make this game so interesting|pg||
nt|psridhar: in my judgment South hand is worth competing at 2 level but not at 3 lev|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psridhar: i would have Xed 2D expressing my willingness for 2 of either major ( in  my methods) -here this room|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|henryb:  you can apply the same principles over unusual 2N: 3@c shows a forcing hand in the other major, 3@d shows a limit raise or better in partner's major, 3 of the other major is not forcing|pg||
nt|psridhar: 12 bds now for DSM to recover 26|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: No, and I said that while you were away|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  There were several strange plays on this hand, starting with East's failure to overtake the second spade, and blocking the suit|pg||
