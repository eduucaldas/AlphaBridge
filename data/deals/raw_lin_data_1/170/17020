nt|bvdahl: I think I agree that 4@h is probably best in the long run...|pg||
nt|iceking: yes and you usually make overtrick so given that 3@H has to be underbid|pg||
nt|jillan:  Will he upgrade this to 8 points|pg||
nt|jcwla: Was dead to rights on beating 4@C but 4@D not so much, whatevah...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and we have 2 more boards of today's schedule|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5@d against 5@h?|pg||
nt|garnetts: tight match |pg||
nt|stewball: this is another example of the inefficiency of a 2nt opening..I've always thought that its the hardest opener to deal with in standard|pg||
nt|jcwla: Has S fully shown this hand?  Or did it take some mention of @D by N for S to know just how great it was?|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 9@C from E would have been better|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi erik, spectators|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Goodmorning all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: hey|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi, back for another dose of Forcing Pass|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|othered1: maximim weak pass by north|pg||
nt|jcwla: I guess if 8-card suits are almost always trump then 9-card suits must always be trump.|pg||
nt|bobholl: this should be no problem ...|pg||
mb|2C!|an|4+!H 4+ohter (Asptro)|nt|sfoxa:  2 next boards, we'll compare the scores, but please disregards the results - it's pair event with IMPs scoring across the field|pg||
nt|rmb1: Roland would be proud of 6@D here|pg||
nt|xenya: there weren't too many forcing passes in the first segment -- just one i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: NS plays 4444, 15-17 and 3 weak 2's|pg||
nt|xenya: usually they bid something|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: The @DQ the key here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, NS have all the power, but may overboard well|pg||
nt|kjadams: likely would not have affected the final result, but a low spade lead rather than the Jack and our declarer might be still playing the hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: last 2 boards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the gap between 1st and 2nd place is narrowing, but Gawrys-Tuszynski are still 10 IMPs ahead |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sfoxa:  in @s game, NS have to guess @d right|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, Lauria-Versace bid 3NT and made 11 tricks after @s lead from E|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as Polish spec pointed out, interview with Piort Gawrys appeared in the main daily paper of Poland on 18th-Feb|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lot of photos, interesting questions |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  yes, they are 26-34 as for now |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r7.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: no puppet here|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why a @s lead at trick one would have put a lot of pressure on S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: declarer should win the race to 7 tricks here.|pg||
nt|stewball: Lauria chose 1@h in the OR--I;m with him|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and for all specs who keep telling me in the polish club the rebid of 2@h would show 6, need to look at Krzysztof Jassem's book on the Polish club:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jillan:  the 2@S opening bid shows 0-7 and 5+@S is this to strong|pg||
nt|ybob: Q@D and @C finesse to 8 tricks, M lead was down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  unexpected end of auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: this might keep them out of slam?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have to be sure they have no 2 losers in @s now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: granth will have to take charege at some point, 6@C or 6nt good|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: NS plays swedish @C (11-13NT or 17+ any) |pg||
pc|d4|nt|iceking: this is makeable looking at all hands|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess 2NT is the other room was natural, many would play it as artificial: scramble (or lebensohl)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W was really lucky to find @cK in partner's very few points|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, with a 0 count.   They pass = 0-7 or 18+|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: 2@C some Gazzili type bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmm  They both did well to keep low |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W was on th right track|pg||
nt|hedyg: N has no @s stopper and S doesnt like his K@S anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: EW plays a Pass-system; 0-7 any or 17+ any, 1@C 12-16 alomost any hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  same start. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W's @s holding is not bold enough, IMHO, to convert passed partner's dbl into penalty|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S would hardly make the contract, but @d game by EW is missed|pg||
nt|hedyg: so lets try to play in @c.......|pg||
nt|hedyg: Tuszynski has a stick|pg||
nt|hedyg: this board will cost EW some|pg||
nt|xenya: not much to the play here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Identical auction.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bobholl: you have to be very sure that 4@C isn't a cue |pg||
nt|hedyg: E could have come in over 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: and there it is|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  7th trick had been stolen|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  his first good move was to bid 4@h|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: Lauria misguessed @DQ OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: The old adage of the Q behind the J......|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  bad news|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, that's the leading team E/W |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so the result|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass over 3@s X denied stopper|pg||
nt|kjadams: The Imp comparisons you see in Movie show vs the Open room, but this is an IMP Pairs competition scored across 8 tables.|pg||
nt|kjadams: again, the nice trump spots will simplify the play.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bessi2: indeed Sælensminde lead a @h vs 2N but followed low when Lauria played towards the Q of @d|pg||
nt|rmb1: At some stage West will have to play another @H to get his ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  as for now, tha matter of course follows the same way as next door|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  trump return?|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has a chance to go wrong - dont know pd has @SK...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  both red suits don't look promising for lead |pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW dont have a good round so far...|pg||
nt|bobholl: will put J|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  may be, only 4@h from S show negative and 4@c - cue with some values in @s, whereas rdbl - 1st class comtril in @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *control, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was a slam invite in @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: would probably not bid 4@c without at least the K@S or a singleton|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: since N denied control|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in OR, W got @h A and cashed @d K to receive a signal from partner. E must have been discouraged @d and W hoped to beat contract with @s continuation|pg||
nt|hedyg: cross ruff for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has to rely on @S 3-2|pg||
mc|10|nt|sfoxa:  now, for instance|pg||
nt|rmb1: Getting urgent :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer has to find @hQ to win, but who cares now...|pg||

nt|jcwla: rebid" but so often it is not the case, you end up not able to show the hand.|pg||

nt|hedyg: we will be back very shortly with the last match|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@S 8-11, one would deduce |pg||
nt|xenya: a wild hand, this|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  last board of this round|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andyv:  and now the final board of this set|pg||
nt|hedyg: Last board of the tournament. Thanks to Yvan Voloshenin, our outstanding operator. Our appreciation goes to the Organising Committee (Pavel Portnoy), the sponsors and all those who ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: have been instrumental in bringing this event to the BBO audience. Thanks to my co-commentators Sveta Bodrenkova , Mark Horton , John Adams and George Holland for sharing their ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: time and wisdom with us. And, of course, to all spectators for their witty and helpful comments.  |pg||
nt|xenya: slow start|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sfoxa:  thanks to all the  specs for watching and providing with hints, great thanks to our operator, job well done!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N may well dream about @d small slam if partner has the right values|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess NS will reach 3NT (eventually) and make +3|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C very fine contract but diffcult to reach after multi|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in ca 25 minutes|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s by N...|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 4@c by S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be :)|pg||
nt|mareczek: multi 2@d weak two in a major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South gets into the spirit of general insansint|pg||
nt|bjacobs: insanity|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: Big round for NS and Lauria-Versace struggling next door|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, NS managed to win 6@c after @h lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: fast board)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they both deserved having a breath :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  both pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: the next match starts soon|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye for now!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|iceking: 1@C simular to magic @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with such a superfit, EW have a lot of aces to concede |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if RDBL shows @d honour, NS here wouldn't  have their life as easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@s is on too |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is 6@s worse?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@S protects the K@H but is on a guess in @D plus @s finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is too final imo|pg||
nt|hedyg: or does it just mean no fit in @d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow Bessis has a great hand now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@S surely F so gives up on slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Does S hand deserves one more bid after "final" 4@s ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and one more round of today's schedule is coming soon, after short break|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next round after very short break, so stay tuned|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sfoxa:  S hoped for his own play when bidding 1@s, not 2 |pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: thx everyone )|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty to Sveta and ty to our wonderful operator, Ivan Volozhenin|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  next round follows right now, so stay tuned|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  currently, NS are providing 40-20 and keep the lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: strikes me that 4@D now would sort this |pg||
nt|hedyg: surely yes, it is a great hand after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|mareczek: dbl of 3@h, what do you think should be?|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2N natural and 3H pass or correct.   3N preempts East from showing suit.|pg||
nt|mareczek: hearts or points?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: even the same |pg||
nt|stewball: Drijver judged to pass 2@c in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: aggressive 1@s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sfoxa:  when EW will find sacrifice (very cheap this time), N would better assess his values and score small plus in 4@s dbld|pg||
nt|hedyg: they make it look so easy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: another fast arrival bid by Volcker|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D 32 is enough so no @D guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: or just trump 2@H |pg||
nt|hedyg: clearly N refused to cuebid anything else so Bessis should pass|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not easy contract at all. especially after @c lead threatening with ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are not scared|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be N should have tried a "natural" 6@C says spec but that isn't natural i fear |pg||
nt|hedyg: and surely would show 1st rd control in @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: true and with the single @D not attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Variations on a theme here.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm, not so S. definitely, no expecting partner with such @s values|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: Just been told that is Brink's birthday |pg||
nt|andyv:  thank yous to Sveta, Sudhir, Vladimir, Ivan our operator and to all the specs who joined us.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 1S generally promises a 5 card suit, and he has one.|pg||
nt|kjadams: just not spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 other pairs played in 2@s as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: slow continuation|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: I think that 2@s solved all problems of N|pg||
nt|mareczek: his problem now is 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Ns hand deserves one more move|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S can have at all valueless hand, kind of xxxx QJx xxx xxx - but only this case is really bad for N|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think that rdbl was "bid your suit" and 2@s promises some values in this case|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3@c must have been very precise with its meaning|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  kind of "maximal hand, both majors. @c values"|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the last board of the round, thanks to all involved in bringing us this event including my fellow commentator Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so N denies his dream|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H = fit in @s and 1st rd ctrl in @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  In OR, NS competed to 4@h and E took the save at 5@d|pg||
nt|xenya: if E had followed suit and bid 4@S, he would have been rewarded|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 5@H defeat 500 with @D leads from S ( played by E) , hard to do|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  will N find @h lead?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thanks to our operator Ivan - half a job well done!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, declarer failed in 6@d trying one plan after another|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3nt may well go down after @h lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  I haven't seen yet how 6@d goes down.. it looks pretty easy to make|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All contracts look easy when you can see all four hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: http://imtransfer.im4mobile.com/uploads/7590129819616131734/Image.jpg|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: online photo)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But not a bad auction at all, when all is said and done|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  the only chance for defence|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Robin, welcome to the last board of the round|pg||
nt|garnetts: They did not get a Diamond lead against 6@C next door |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we'll have 3 more rounds after lunch break|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: No way, this is cheap insurance time, nobody knows who is making what and they're not going to voluntarily allow a possible double swing.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  careful now! E has to play @c, not @d  in return|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next one is coming soon|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Expert's voice to hear! hi Mark|pg||
nt|sga1: NS haven't bid well here. S should make a bid with 4-4 in majors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  was N afraid of second DBL after 3@d?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:   let's add spices to this game! - Zaleski|pg||
nt|kjadams: double of 3H works when partner has 4H, but otherwise it just lets west in on the hand.|pg||
nt|mareczek: no nie|pg||
nt|mareczek: sorry, priv|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whatever you've agreed.  If haven't agreed, natural for now and we make the agreement after the hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I have to admit, bridge players in photos are just not that exciting.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jillan:  maybe S should have ducked that|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting defence here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: East has done well to go past 3NT, easily down on a heart lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: one played 2@c= , 1 went off in 2@H and 1 went off in 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: but 4@S is quite close|pg||
nt|xenya: looks as if only a trump now might hold|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, would keep declarer to 7 spades and two top red cards|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rmb1: Next round at 14:30 CET (13:30 GMT) in 1 hour 40|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rmb1: Sorry.  I thought we had started the next round early :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nor here either |pg||
nt|mareczek: unlucky choice of Zmudzinski|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Mark|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bessi2: he must play a spade from dummy now if he want to avoid a guess|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is the last board of this segment.  Thanks to Roland, Ivan, John and Marek, and all kibs. |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mareczek: thanks a lot, bye :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good partner finds correct lead, very good one - finds one more trick in the suit |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  idea about cashing @c ace seems better - if partner discourages, E has possibility to switch to @d|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|iceking: yes looks clear duck trick one |pg||
nt|jillan:  gives W entries to play @C from dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: in 2 @s all made overtricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bessi2: and now another diamond and declarer must guess|pg||
nt|ybob: was better play K@D and @S to hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. east must not ponder too long though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but N has to establish his @h trick or attack the @ds|pg||
nt|mareczek: but it is hard to imagine that opponents can have only 3 cards in one of majors|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he has a @D guess :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what for? LOL|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: see you all in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty Hedy, see you soon|pg||
nt|bobholl: tya cu later|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW are going to 6@d as well, imo. so we'll follow one more example of declarer play|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  current standing to be found here http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r8.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  cashing 2 more @s grants declarer with the contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceking: will just use it to play @C to Ten i assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's dbl of 3@h will get the defense off the the right lead against 6@d|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rmb1: spec says 3@C = max with both majors (2NT = min with both)|pg||
nt|mareczek: so the heart was sensible option|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|jillan:  now I see why....'|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even this ruff doesn't prevent declarer from making|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - a push|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kjadams: down 1.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think they will make it|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The hand will turn on the play of the club suit|pg||
nt|kjadams: the trump lead here was the killer.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: we will start next round in 1 hour 22 minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  see you. thanks to all|pg||
nt|kjadams: passing 2C was the winner on this hand.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: This is the last board of this round - 14 more rounds to follow.  We'll be back soon|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should admit, you joined the most interesting board of the round :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: looks like the normal play|pg||
nt|andyv:  why Mark?  don't you ever finesse for 10s in slams?:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jillan:  normal result|pg||
nt|othered1: south m ade two odd plays there|pg||
nt|jillan:  10 or eleven tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lots more bridge on BBO today|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4H would likely make by north south, so not really a loss for Multi.|pg||
nt|mareczek: N nie musia³e mieæ czterech pików, adam mia³ ich sporo|pg||
nt|mareczek: sorry again|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hedyg: it did help him clear the @ss with just 1 loser|pg||
nt|kjadams: club misguess did not help|pg||

nt|hedyg: everybody is waiting for Gawrys to finish, all other tables are through|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  NS lost a bunch of imps, but can find consolation in retaining pair's moral. Leading partner's suit. |pg||

nt|jcwla: Strange stuff here.  |pg||
nt|andyv:  I've seen NS have much better days...this was a rough set for them|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: Anyway, thanks Sveta and Ivan and all kibs.  For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|kjadams: seeing all the hands makes North's problem hard to see, but the play of the club suit suggests different holdings for declarer than he actually has.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  from both side, I'd say |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thank you Jordan|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thanks to all the specs and special "bravo" to our operator - one should try this jib once to understand :)|pg||

nt|jcwla: For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|kjadams: This is such an outstanding event.   The organizers must be thanked for bringing this quality field together.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  Full list of participants looks impressive - we have a little more time to examine it http://www.slavacup.com/list.of.participants.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: Hello|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm   for results and running scores.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello to all. Round 12 of Slava Cup is about to start |pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: Hello|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all - round 13 of Slava Cup|pg||
nt|hedyg: suspense for NS|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for those who joined us now - this event consists of 2 independent groups, Top-16 especially invited by organizers|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS in 6th place|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  splits are awful for each side playing|pg||
nt|daman: Hi John|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: Hello|pg||
mb|p|an|0-7/17+|nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the 7th round of Slava Cup, the most prestigeous tournament in Russia |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tournament site http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm |pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello Bob. re-hi Ivan, our splendid operator|pg||
nt|andyv:  hello ao all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Sudhir, re-hi Ivan|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm for current standing|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Sudhir, Sveta and Ivan, our operator|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and Top-40 - part of them invited as well, second part - for recent sports achievement|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/israel/Herbst-Herbst.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: still, +200 is not bad|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzyv: hello|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  re-hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: Hello|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Polish experience vs. Dutch drive|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW may well land in 3NT having 25 points, but the mission of collecting 9 tricks may be impossible |pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d not everybodies choice|pg||
nt|kjadams: Gawrys/Tuszinski are leading,   Herbst/Herbst are 3rd|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have no CC for EW, sry|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: 20-20 hand.  W has no call over 1@S.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW can hardly win the bidding, although... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let' see|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello to all - round 6 of Slava Cup is about to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nothing like a slam to start things off.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marek Wójcicki|pg||
nt|mareczek: hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marek, Roland, John, Ivan.|pg||
nt|andyv:  welcome all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  N showed @h and @c two-suiter and E seems to be happy to dbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: preempt over preempt|pg||
nt|kjadams: With one match to go, 1st is 30 VPs (Half a full match score) ahead of Lauria/Versace|pg||
nt|hedyg: they were vice european junior champions in ..1978? and until last year played rather rarely together|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mareczek: Gromow Dubinin play strong club, Precision style|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for those who joined as today - this tournament consist of 2 groups, Top-16 and Top-40 |pg||
nt|andyv:  Ivan Volozhenin will be our operator|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are following the first one and current standing is here http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  low @s will net this contract|pg||
nt|sga1: 5@d seems to be makeable contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  W does not have an easy lead but the K@s would make the papers|pg||
nt|sga1: with low @s, even 3N will score|pg||
nt|hedyg: i love the 2NT by Gawrys protecting his Q@H! as well as the @s honours|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the runners-up - Lauria-Vercase are playing vs. Gromov-Dubinin - not an easy opps|pg||
nt|hedyg: by not opening 1@c his hand is limited|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: dont think S should upgrade his hand |pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brother play natural system with transfer responses after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|bobholl: could be 3NT NS|pg||
nt|hedyg: ( i am counting on our Polish specs to help me out )|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south upgrades to 12, OK with 2.5 honor tricks, I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: hi to all|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N maybe an inquiry as to type of raise|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW are leaders now|pg||
nt|hedyg: there go the @d losers|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North might have doubled 4@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might have done a lot of things, like consider slam opposite AQ@H|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Depends on your preemptive style |pg||
nt|hedyg: except he has probably seen his pd's 3@H openings before|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes hi Mark :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow 4@D has not left him space to explore|pg||
nt|hedyg: results  and standings: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: very long think|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: make little sense to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT a challenge - 4@S better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, not a coffee-board for a start|pg||
nt|sharkey: nope - East may have overbid slightly - a little to good for 3@S over 3@H.  Needs to take @H finesse I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: West looking at @SQ and @HA....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brothers, sorry|pg||
nt|mareczek: they both use the same system :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  current standing is here http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm |pg||
nt|rmb1: Only nine tricks in spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The point of the 0-7 / 17+ pass is that next hand can't really interfere with it ... so the gain here for the Forcing Pass system is that it will likely get less interference on ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it's "big club" type auctions|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: 5-3-3-2 shape bad suit cant see the reason|pg||
nt|jillan:  with a system as this I agree with Magnus|pg||
nt|jcwla: A false preference to 2@S would be better, perhaps those @H's looked like six to N.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If at first you don't succeed ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The hand sitting over the pass needs to play "normally" - i.e. open its opening bids, or pass otherwise|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the 3rd round of Slava Cup http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and current standing of Top-16 http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|kjadams: this missing heart Q will stop this at 6.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's a pairs event with IMPs scoring across the field, so the scores that appear should be considered indirectly|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to assess the size of his bad luck|pg||
nt|hedyg: great spots in @H|pg||
nt|kjadams: agree on the 2N.  Very nice call.  Right sides hand, and he can infer help in Hearts from auction.|pg||
nt|daman: it will be hard to defeat this one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think this can fairly be called a poor contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ew better find the penalty double cards|pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: well judged|pg||
nt|jillan:  would need at least another 10 LOL|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 1N was just generic point-showing, so south had to bid|pg||
nt|iceking: assume now S has shown 12-13hcp with 5@S |pg||
nt|mareczek: Dubinin assumed that partner does not have @dxxx|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N will have to find 4 discards on @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is his 9th trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think one starts watching this table armed with a cup of strong coffee.  The explanation of the 1@D bid beggars the mind|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|iceking: N took a very good view stop now, i would be little bid interested in 3nt looking at his hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  getting fit, W will bid game|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can play the @hs himself for 2 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  EW did their best to win the bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. but even now, N can manage his tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S is clearly showing a spade shortage |pg||
nt|andyv:  slam a poor proposition |pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  at the tournament web-site, one can find the participants lists (quite impressive) and results for both groups - Top-16 and Top-40|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Brink-Driver won round 1 and are still doing well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not even a false preference in this case.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tournament is being played in 2 groups - Top 16 includes mostly international stars (Lauria-Versace, ex.)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Something of an overbid in my view|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and Top-40 - mainly Russian players, but with invited guests as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: must play @H before @D to get to the 2nd @H trick|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's better line than playing @c - when S comes on lead, he'll return @s|pg||
nt|kjadams: Diamond to dummy, heart to the T wins in North has the King.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: difficult decision now but anything is good|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|hedyg: hello :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Bob :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and hello to Yvan , our operator |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like organizers intended to provide each nation with BBO-starring opportunity here, whereas Open room is occupied by Lauria-Versace |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Sveta :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls dont send our specs to the OR :(|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  young Bessis is attractive to watch as well :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they all 4 are|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 very talented young players|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS - one of the best Russian pair, national representetatives lot of times|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  helping hand from defence?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for 10th trick|pg||
nt|rmb1: Help = playing diamonds for declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: so their CC says nv random preempt, vuln disciplined|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  when in dbld partscore, always lead trump - this regulation rarely sucks |pg||
nt|andyv:  18 hcp responding hands hard to keep down|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW will not be able to generate 4@h tricks so 3N will make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  looks impossible|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it seems, EW have no game to play|pg||
nt|hedyg: hardly with 20 hcps in N|pg||
nt|kjadams: do not need double finesse that way|pg||
nt|hedyg: i love spotcards :)|pg||
nt|daman: timing is everything|pg||
nt|kjadams: If south has king, contract probably doomed, so a heart now seems sensible.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Even 2 is too high|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: Our operator, William Hernebrink, advises sys on after W 1@h, 1NT on 1@c 8-11 balanced hand |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3@h by NS looks good, even @h game is possible with non-accurate defence|pg||
nt|rmb1: The Polish specs agree it is not possible|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hello|pg||
nt|stewball: hi all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hi John|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and hi John :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcwla: Presumably 5@C is one keycard, 5@D asks for the @HQ, and 5@H denies it - 5NT is a surprise but they've stopped in the making small slam.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should fail even on a @h lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  unlikely to lead a @c here|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will probably settle for a @d lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: i would play small @D now but i guess he knows better than that|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h lead will be ok but auction doesn't call for it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  why is E leading?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will need to get back to hand and lead @s to board|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kjadams: Two John's today   I can go by KJ  if it helps :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  something awry here|pg||
nt|xenya: NS don't have enough points, nor enough trumps, nor enough shape -- yet they reached 4@H in 2 bids -- hard to commentate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: may as well try to draw trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's the 11 opposite 11 syndrome|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North was stuck a little, and has decided to pray that partner holds @D8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: after 8 rounds EW are 5th, NS 10th|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sga1: N is declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: rather than show count in @H S showed suit preference in @C|pg||
nt|kjadams: From North's perspective, Ace of clubs in South is enough.  KQ is disappointing.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West is also stuck a little ...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  lol...my 3rd line of bidding disappeared!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: It is understandable why N might choose to bid 2@H, this is the type of hand that could make a @H game with the right holding and some extras in S.  Also, the suit has nice ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: texture.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if he does other way he has 2 losers in @ss|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  I thought they stopped at 3N|pg||
nt|sga1: :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  scent of chance: @s to the table, ruff @h and concede @c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hoping S has no more @cs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and the chance of finding @dA second remains|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4of @s is an entry|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North might have led a heart at trick one|pg||
nt|daman: take the money and run|pg||
nt|xenya: i remember trying a strong pass over a forcing pass -- that is you pass with a strong (semi)balanced hand, then start doubling -- seemed to work quite well -- was fun, at any rate|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And South :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|iceking: he has a very good 11 i would say|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, either way it's a guess and N did well here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: William plays the same system and is able to explain when he alerts. Excellent!|pg||
nt|garnetts: The cards are very forgiving for NS --6-3 spade break plus both aces in west hand |pg||
pc|sA|nt|iceking: maybe he needs to downgrade his hands if his pd is always upgrading:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in Poland, they say: luck is a privilege of a strong player|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 9th trick hurrah :)|pg||

nt|kjadams: I suspect sacrificing trumps and then tapping dummy would have netted another on defense.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rmb1: We missed that chance|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: It is true that a more passive lead might beat it --but we would all lead a spade except that the 3NT bid seems to indiicate two stops |pg||

nt|hedyg: even being last in this field is excellent :p|pg||
nt|kjadams: Love to know what 5N requested.    Certainly Jxxxxx would be a good Grand...|pg||
nt|jcwla: For most 5NT would confirm the presence of all keycards and the queen of trumps.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this slam well under 50%|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS should get to 3N at this vul|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A solid result for the winners|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or are they allowed to downgrade?|pg||
mb|1D!|an|8-11 0+!D|nt|jillan:  ormally not good when one puts on the breaks all the time and the other one has the gas pedal well footedf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C by N now, can be 15-17 balanced|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S will depend on how the spade suit is tackled |pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway score is the same|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nope - downgrading is for wimps, which E/W are not|pg||
mb|1S|nt|iceking: alot of pdships actually work like that|pg||
nt|kjadams: but not after the Queen ask and denial|pg||
mb|1N!|an|5+!C|nt|sfoxa:  with 25 points, EW have no game to play, but NS can compete till 3@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: Likely 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: wheather he open 3 or 1@C they will reach 3nt|pg||
nt|stewball: 3nt coming|pg||
nt|sga1: Double Dummy, 13 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW may well land in 6@d|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: it is a complete guess |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more example of contemporary style - 1@d opening|pg||
nt|hedyg: too good for a 3@c opening|pg||
nt|kjadams: She's not sung yet.    30 VP lead going into final match on a 60 point scale is not a lock.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: Any game here's a challenge.... - perhaps 4@H the better|pg||
nt|hedyg: Polish @c opening|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW can rich 4@h here, tough this contract have no play seemingly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  NS have enough for the game, but bidding it looks easier than making|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c is on with the @d finesse|pg||
nt|sga1: 6@D shud be final spot|pg||
nt|daman: the Herbst's are in 3rd place|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyv: Hello to all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and EW - famous and experienced pair from the Netherlands |pg||
nt|bobholl: after the double 6@C looks good|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  rather marked with dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be alble to make it without much problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  able|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@D transfer to 2@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: actaully I am talking rubbish--need a coffee--you can't really get it wrong can you?  |pg||
nt|hedyg: now he just has to make it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W could lead a small @s giving the contract, but with E on lead this game looks like impossible|pg||
nt|sga1: What system EW r playing?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzyv: very cold)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, looks easier as in previous board|pg||
nt|andyv:  another no play contract...unfortunately tough to stay out of|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if @s will be lead, declarer has to cash 2 top @ds in attempt to pitch @s loser on @h thereafter|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, and will make 7 that way|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so we, but they have different mind|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W's turn ... this is not bridge|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  looks like|pg||
nt|jcwla: A pretty moth-eaten vul opener but nothing sits too badly here.|pg||
nt|rmb1: or not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  commentator's curse :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd opt for 3nt as well, but...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, another red suit must be ruffed to bring success for defence|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer can probably survive a @D ruff by South|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  For S, it's hard to imagine @d ruff is of no use this time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: more overbidding here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  so, the right time to stick to the bridge table for round the day :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: or as Michael Barel says setting up the 5th @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: marked is assuming , W could well have the Q@D |pg||
nt|bjacobs: misbidding really|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S may be ok too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS can overboard easily|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first board played was a good illustration of normal matter of course: bid what you have and lead what you have. Suppose, it will be repeated several times.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't know of too many Ws that would lead a low @s from that holding but I'm sure they are out there!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. the first one was from the topic "don't show it to beginners", but this one is notmal|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: south looks at this fine spot and is happy he's not vulnerable|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, both @h and @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  altough without it, EW would hardly bid game|pg||
nt|bobholl: as he has the @H queen :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: Even with poor guessing this one should come home|pg||
nt|stewball: declarer doesnt know everything is sitting perfectly\|pg||
nt|kjadams: 9 with bad guesses, 11 with good guesses.|pg||
nt|stewball: @s seems to be 4/4 that will help|pg||
nt|kjadams: Lot's of speculation that it's extra length ask.   Seems reasonable, but can't confirm.|pg||
nt|hedyg: unavoidable 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You have to call it as it is.  Sure, they play 8-11 openings, but in no way does that West hand resemble 8 points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like a 3 count to me|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  they are over 3nt, seemingly 4@h finishes the bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but E can survive without @d lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no, he couldn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see how|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I was wrong|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: I agree Sveta--everyone opens this sort of hand these days--except me--I prefer Roth-Stone ideology where first and second seat bids are sound |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I can find 1 losing option: playing @sJ in the first round of the suit|pg||
nt|rmb1: Presumably East will run the 10 once he has checked his calculations|pg||
nt|hedyg: a question of timing now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd like to know what did 1@s bid mean|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sfoxa:  as a kibitser pointed out, S like his hand much more than it's worth|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and only @h lead will beat this contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: Open room playing faster (3 boards scored).  Open room NS did not let through 4S on  27.  10IMP to Dutch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even  now, @h return creates problem for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|sga1: May be 4th suit force|pg||
nt|sga1: if natural bidding|pg||
nt|sga1: any one knows system of EW?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I was told exactly the same by several French specs. Merci.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4th-suit, game forcing|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have played a @D as N -- but hardly matters here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: and not doubled|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have liked N to bal with 1nt here instead of dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead best|pg||
nt|sharkey: But East on lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  attempt to pitch @d losers on @c will reduce W trump holding destined to 2 tricks anyway with this @h split|pg||
nt|sharkey: This plays better from N - else @S lead wud also disrupt communicarions|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even with E hand, trump start looks better than any other|pg||
nt|sharkey: *communications|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @h continuation after @sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: of course a defensive mistake is always possible, but at this level we do not expect too many of those|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  declarer sees a lot of possibilities, I suppose|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, the question is which one to choose?|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is IMP scoring and the scores from all 8 tables are included.  On the Movie button you'll see the score from the other BBO table, but the IMP score may not be correct.|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think all options are losing ones Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are aware of it, not so declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see, how it goes. Should admit, trump lead created the biggest bundle of problems for declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *normal, sorry|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he has it right|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  juicy result for NS|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@c - they play double checkback, so 2@c showed any invitational hand|pg||
nt|sga1: Also they seem to be playing 1@h rebid forcing.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has impossible task of finding a @s lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N should decide for @s lead, even from his unattractive (for lead) holding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d suit - is a base one of E, @h lead looks like being for nothing|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like a @h lead coming up|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, with @h lead N wouldn't help declarer, yes|pg||
nt|sga1: unbid suit is @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  there are we seeing @sQ by S, not so N :)|pg||
nt|sga1: with @S lead he may well sell the contract, he doesn't know.|pg||
nt|sga1: spec says 3NT by W says 4-card @S suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  right time for @d lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: not happy to lead @d from K@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play @H|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @h is ok, not so @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: Roland will need to make a new list of slow players|pg||
nt|xenya: instead of the @SA i mean|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  so this N quest is rather for feeling, not for logic|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: South is trying to find a way of defeating this --but he can see there is virtually none by now unless a club trick is on the way |pg||
nt|jcwla: This hand could conceivably depend on W's rebid after 1@H - if W is on lead to NT, has an easy @C lead that might make the difference.|pg||
nt|kjadams: This is a really impressive event.   16 of the best players in the world competing for $10,000 Top Prize|pg||
nt|hedyg: even coming last is prestigeous!|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 5th @S will develop|pg||
nt|daman: prestige isn't translated into cash unfortunately :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Vladimir|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: N that is.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: voila the |pg||
nt|hedyg: H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  this time, altough, both declarer and defence are on the thin path. 8 tricks aren't the question, but if somebody bids game...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this tournament was nominated to the best bridge event in Russia in 2007, giving Russian player "live" expereince of meeting Hacketts or Zia at the table|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d lead was a kind of trap for declarer - playing this suit by himself, he'll rather find @d A onsite |pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes @H now succeed for defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  that lead was not worth the wait|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  even @s brings a trick now |pg||
nt|rmb1: Oh|pg||
nt|xenya: ciao Giorgio|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: Did the double distinguish between possible hands?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that way seems better than other options|pg||
nt|andyv:  althouth 3N may be normal, W opening 1@s might have slowed N down with only 1 @s stopper.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  either way, EW didn't have to strain too hard on this defense.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kjadams: club shift found in time|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
nt|sga1: true|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm -1 now instead of -2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  case closed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: i doubt everybody will bid this slam|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  but we ought remember - being at the table under BBO spot - is a kind of additional pressure.|pg||

nt|bridge_one: hi Bill |pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jillan:  yeah but not together with Pards hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Here's a good chance for east to get back into the match|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NT game for EW looks good|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  6@s without problem in play, may be hard to bid after N opening|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 'almost any' 12-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@S I think is the bid of choice...|pg||
nt|mareczek: another slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after all, we have next board|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@d transfer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  isn't my choice, but I now few who would willing |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s Q is presumably by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  same with previous board - 3nt doesnt look like easy contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h by N... favorable vul for EW will get them in auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW probably play ELC with their take out doubles|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sfoxa:  oh, going wrong. this time N decided to remain silent|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, @c and little bit strenght vs. hearts and a little bit lenght|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  oh. I'm wrong.  but can't agree with considering N's hand as destructive one|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H=@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E find @d lead, EW can beat 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: what should w bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H maybe |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  contemporary openings became lighter till impossible - S hand wasn't opening worth in accordance with Acol standartds |pg||
nt|mareczek: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r2.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one looks better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this wouldn't prevent EW from bidding high, suppose|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs to get into this bidding soon|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Polish Club by EW - 1@c may include strong opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: running scoers|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW would better to stop low|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@S denies 4 cards|pg||
nt|kjadams: Interesting point John.   Smith in that case would say I am known not to have the Jack, therefore encouraging is extra length.   Still requires sound agreements.|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s inquires as to type of raise (some play it as which suit would responder accept a game try|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play acol style with 5 card @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: N Splinter bid 4@H - as suggested by kib|pg||
nt|mareczek: scores|pg||
nt|garnetts: Spotlight on South now |pg||
nt|stewball: i think the NS action in the OR guaranteed they would bid slam|pg||
nt|stewball: propelled them|pg||
nt|kjadams: not to have T. |pg||
nt|stewball: 4@s now?|pg||
nt|kjadams: Zia won last year, playing with Roy Welland|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W don't depart from their system even when their opponents open the bidding (at least with 1@C) - this is totally mysterious to me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still they've nailed N/S here ... or more accurately, N/S have nailed themselves|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Martínez|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for me, 2 aces isn't my dream hand for Multi (desctructive) opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: well done |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  once more - lucky NS, this time with @h split |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the North hand is too good for a weak two--nearer to a strong two in my view lol :)  |pg||
nt|hedyg: here without transfer bids N could hardly enter the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  funny in modern bridge how you can't get the @c suit in the auction (if you are overcaller) after opps open 1@c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 rounds of @d and one more after in with @hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jillan:  3NT should make....|pg||
nt|jillan:  or could anyhow|pg||
nt|othered1: This hand might work better without the 2@C opening -- a common result with a minor 1-suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: scroll back :)|pg||
nt|iceking: horrible hand in any system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but what is your rebid after 1@D  1M?|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@s and 3 @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have to defend carefully to beat it|pg||
nt|sga1: well done|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice lead to find|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H shows 5-5, the E hand is limited to 15 hcps by opening 1@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a stronger hand he would have opened 1@c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: Today I think all players would open 3rd hand - many also 1. & 2. hand|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi Roland, hi everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Roberto|pg||
nt|ybob: Hello :)|pg||
nt|ybob: what is 1@D by S ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good question|pg||
nt|ybob: i agree with 1@H but i like pass 1@S|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@D = no 5M|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer has no chance to play @c wrong, and 1 trick in @s is enough|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price is right for 5@c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's only first step, 3 more to follow|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N can see that @h lead will rather attack declarer communication line|pg||
nt|hedyg: our kind Polish specs point out that he is limited to 17|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would not deny 4 cards @d in my 2nd bid even with a minimum opening|pg||
nt|daman: same here|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|daman: finding your fit is important in bridge|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: 2 other major|pg||
nt|othered1: easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  however NS may already be a little shellshocked from the first 2 boards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The poor hearts.  Looks like about 7 off in total in the last 4 boards.  But of course this one is a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|bridge_one: e/w in this hand have many chance playing 3Nt - also 4@H can be made with a help by opps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|iceking: 2sp probably over 1@H if you open 1@D |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, Italian style|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent treatment|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant see open this east hand 1@D |pg||
nt|jillan:  me neither|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10 or 11 tricks here - coffee time...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, really - 3rd hand allows that. I disregarded this "pecularity".|pg||
nt|ybob: pd shows 5@S so this shows limits values|pg||
nt|daman: now they have a bit of trouble|pg||
nt|daman: 1@H - 2@D - 3@D - 3NT would be too easy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: EW may have missed a good sac|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - @s game is cool|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 1@s looks better even with 2cards by W|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 3@H was 15-17 5-5|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty specs !|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcwla: Not my idea of a red weak 2 in @H's with 12 "berries": A 10 K 9 Q 6 J 5 T 4 9 2 8 1 -- would want more like 18.  And yet again S defers to N's "hearts."  Really surprised @S's not ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: mentioned at all, deep position.|pg||
nt|kjadams: possible auction confusion here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is: oh grrrrrrr he doesnt know i have 4 card fit, i have to show it now|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|iceking: problem doing so is you have such a powerful hand, you will need rest of your bidding trying to recover |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can because a jump in the other major is artificial as I play it|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3 @D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|iceking: and usually end up just guessing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can be a hand too good for a 3@D rebid|pg||
nt|ybob: 5 tricks by EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and points count should help avoid @h finess |pg||
nt|hedyg: a slow 3@ds :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they would better to stop here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in 4NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: Actually, in Kaplan-Sheinwold, it can go 1@D -1M - 3@D forcing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guessing @c right ends declarer's problems, even if not, he can escape finding W with short @h but 2 trumps only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh! I'm wrong|pg||
nt|kjadams: well done|pg||
nt|andyv:  this can make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W is on the right track|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ybob: now K ?|pg||
nt|ybob: K shows 3@C and good time to play another @S from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have to attack @d in time|pg||
nt|ybob: @D will play from S|pg||
nt|ybob: K@C , @S, and S low @D |pg||
nt|stewball: next|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h probably down 1 on a @d lead by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how you would ever know when to sac is a mystery however|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcwla: Evidently.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: 4NT to play for me|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so for me (and seemingly for S with his black holdings)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could cue @s or soemthing for slam and why would he want to play slam when he bid 3NT earlier?|pg||
nt|daman: apparently    an immediate 3@D shows a strong hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iceking: but it doesnt show a hand to good for 1@D opening:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for the defense, W has one J too many|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|kjadams: I usually punish my partners for pulling me out of 3N by bidding slam.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it does, but over 2@d the N hand is nice |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: showing a hand you'd have opened 2@C if suit were a major and you have hand an extra natural bid along the way.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I try to avoid opening 2@C with a long minor, especially diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  hand pretty much plays itself|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, both contracts are close -- but should be defeated|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: have had|pg||
nt|rmb1: A Roland slam, missed and not making 12 :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|daman: a plethora of 10's|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer will do very well to get out for 2 off here ... needs a first round heart finesse it seems|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To Martin's point ... West had no clue about @DAKxxxx opposite - |pg||
nt|bjacobs: so they are indeed bidding totally in the dark|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|iceking: i agree its the worsed seq after 2@C opening|pg||
nt|othered1: If you generally open old-fashioned soundly, you get some edges on the big hands . . |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW have piece of luck as well - S is holding @s 6 ( not 10) fourth|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think he can avoid 3@H losers|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mareczek: 4@c + 4@s + ruff + @hAK +@dA = 12|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW are granted wit 1 trick|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|ybob: hi :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  after all, 12 tricks are here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good move by N - his only chance is @s, not @d|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  W wondering whether to ruff and switch but A@h would indicate E doesn't want switch|pg||
nt|chessmaste: If you don't start with 1@C you are always limited |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|othered1: If I jump shift without a fit, the field likely would have opened 2@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  so it turns out that EW needed to do the sacrificing on this hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: After previous hand de Wijs and Muller may still be "shell shocked"|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  cheap escape|pg||
nt|hedyg: or 3@cs :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think he makes or 2@C 3@H or 2@H 3@C losers|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am not sure what a @s from E would have provoked as defense|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S 8 growing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: there was no entry to the S hand so playing K@s was np|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  yes, Marek, you are correct|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ybob: yes, rare play by N|pg||
nt|hedyg: but ofc Ron cannot know that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And this is a sequence of plays that does indeed lead to 3 off|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The system seemed to prevent East from showing AK-seventh in a good hand.  After just 5 boards, I never want to see this system again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might be acceptable with some intermediate strength natural 2 openings|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We haven't found out what the 2 openings are ... |pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 2m 8-11 5+ w/o 4cM|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 2@H 5+@H5+@S 8-11, 2@S 0-7 5+@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 12-14|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is redundant with 1X openings, truely stupid system design|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So apart from their weak NT, all their 12-17 point hands are opened 1@C|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|iceking: makes now|pg||
nt|mareczek: twelve no problem tricks - so he takes the insurance|pg||
nt|mareczek: with safety play in clubs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, it's IMP game|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: can we play NT now?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: so now Q@C and K@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: Bridge is such an odd game--I would not have bid over 2@H also would not have opned 2@H--so many different views |pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: If it wasn't for the fact they are leading this event, I would say it's totally unplayable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q and K better|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|vugraphzwe: It|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: It's good when they have 8-11 hands|pg||
nt|xenya: that would have saved a trick, yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and many imp|pg||
nt|xenya: still +3 imps as EW bid and made 3N in the other room|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|jcwla: If they bid and make a bunch of spades against you on that last one, crawl back in bed.|pg||
nt|sga1: simple 13 tricks in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  why did W reject his last chance to win, if @h behaving well with small defence mistake? just by the way|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  bundle of points by EW, they have to make good use from them|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry yes Vice Champions|pg||
nt|daman: the fat lady is starting to drink tea and honey|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Pass = 0-7 of 18+|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Forcing pass systems work mainly through the surprise factor - they quickly fade after opponents in the geographical area get used to them|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ybob: good result to Ew, NS win 8 tricks NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and the number of boards played provides you with pros and cons of your approach. |pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C lead directing with @H fit ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|kjadams: You will find two events there.    A "top 16" which is what we are watching.|pg||
nt|kjadams: It is invitational only and has only superstars|pg||
nt|chessmaste: It seems unfair that you could make game in a 4-3 spade fit, or a 5-1 heart fit, but not a 5-4 diamond fit (and 3Nt was cold as well) |pg||
mb|3H|nt|iceking: i guess you overcall 1@S |pg||
nt|othered1: impossible because east won't let it play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after all, yes. good for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this trump suit is better in W's point of view|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Each round consist of 8 board and the scoring is on IMPs converted to VPs - max score per round is 60-0|pg||
nt|jcwla: From the nature of this W bed it looks like E probably meant the 2@C on prev hand as xfr cuebid.|pg||
nt|jcwla: bid not bed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Wow, east is really walking t his|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As the cards lie, EW can make 5@D|pg||
nt|iceking: and should make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you guess diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @H lead keeps 3NT on 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: imo Gino thought Bessis had 4 cards in @H|pg||
nt|stewball: an uncomfortable 3@d i'm sure|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Top spot, 3NT by N|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  could help E decide either to defend or not|pg||
nt|hedyg: they lost against Duboin Ferraro !|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West's 2@D is transfer to @H - either to play or GF I assume|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm, will S decide to convert this dbl into penalty?|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - dont think so - choice between pest and cholera....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it would be useful for NS, but hardly possible|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  somebody draws conclusions, somebody - doesn't|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with J1087 is fine|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 4@S isn't so bad? More or less on a @C hook?|pg||
nt|xenya: or 4@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South certainly has to bid something|pg||
nt|xenya: with AK, yes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: Now east is sure to guess @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  re-hello|pg||
nt|garnetts: cards poorly placed for NS--they stopped pretty low but this will suffer a club ruff in due cousre too|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the friendly @H position slam is on|pg||
nt|kjadams: Glad Hammon did not see that auction.   3N was a possible contract...|pg||

nt|kjadams: yes, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Will East let him play there? No|pg||

nt|hedyg: would Gawrys make an effort if he knew about the @H fit?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North's sequence is very strong - not how I would have bid it actually, preferring 2@S the first time|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 tricks are ON|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so better 3n|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mareczek: 1@s - acceptance with 3 cards probably, 2@h natural, inv+|pg||
nt|mareczek: Rusinow lead - second from the sequence of honours|pg||
nt|bessi2: this lead will not paralyse declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however also 3N is dangerous with @D leads|pg||
nt|xenya: not on a heart lead and diamond continuation, Giorgio|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: 2@S x wud be off 2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Round 4 of Slava Cup in progress. torunament site http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  don't be surprised with the opening - 1@c can include 5332 with 5@d, 1@d opening - unbalanced hands|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: East bid 5@D all by himself|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can prevent declarer from 9th trick, but it isn't obvious|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now S has to cash @c A and continue @h |pg||
nt|hedyg: everybody will lead @h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - also the continuetion @D need the finesse in @C|pg||
nt|xenya: tough to find, admittedly|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  bearing in mind, W may pass in the first round and re-open with DBL thereafter, EW can land into 3@d - not so easy to beat|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W can beat 4@s underleading @h ace, and even without this lead, defenders will take 1 heart and 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|kjadams: 8 tricks if guess clubs.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: at 3N opps can make a mistake, at 4@S impossible|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jillan:  he got HIGH from the last hand >)(|pg||
nt|iceking: neither table overcalled 4@S |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS are off to a good start and won't take unnecessary risks I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  "peacful" hand after all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *peaceful|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after this bidding and first lead (nothing to ruff) - coffee-board :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 5, NS got to 3N making 4 for a 12 imp swing and on board 4, EW did not get to slam in OR for another 12 imp swing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a good example of the fundamental that grand slams have no play - the are claimed, if the bidding was correct|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, despite me saying I never wanted to see it again, a combined kibitzer has sent me a link to the system:  http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/cc/sh-ta.pdf|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Takes a trumplead to beat this?|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: I guess I thought east was walking this before I saw the other table's actions.  Inconceivable that I"d sell to 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: i bid in my world is just clear-cut |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this one will be claimed at trick one|pg||
nt|xenya: this might make|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stewball: this will require very careful play |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but the matter of course would be rather the same (2@h instead of 2@d for pairs not using transfers)|pg||
nt|garnetts: excellent play to lead the @D earlier but it wont help |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 clubs, sorry|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  that helps declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would seem so.  Declarer can ruff one club, and all the other club losers go on the majors|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rmb1: Yes.  So 5@H is a phantom|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  better small gain than unknown win/loss game|pg||
nt|stewball: @s endplay|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rmb1:  28 was flat in 4@S-1 on the same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|stewball: or careless defence:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and in 4@S there are also this problem|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They have to be careful here, or the thing still makes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: 6 trumps, club ruff and 4 tricks in the majors |pg||
nt|xenya: you can simply play hearts at every opportunity, in 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: beat all return her|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not at all ... if he had played a black suit, declarer will make|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  actually, we should disregard the scores here - it's pair tournament with IMPs scoring across the field|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlikely to find the winning play of top honours in @H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Draw all the trumps, then developing a heart trick by force|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But he's found the red suit play, and now East must follow up by exterminating South's @HJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can play 4 trump, @C in the dummy and J@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so only @H and @D beat|pg||
nt|xenya: @D doesn't|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now only @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: before only @D|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: before also @D|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: This is a Pair Contest with IMP score.  EW and NS all play on the Dutch National team and are pitted against each other first round|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  these pairs faced each other last year in Ostend representing their countries|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  actually, Top-16 of the Slava Cup consisted of top stars of nations |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after 3 rounds, the NS are 4th and EW- 3rd, as you may guess|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It was a great bid if East had let him play there|pg||
nt|iceking: north can never ever bid 3nt there without Qxx in @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have passed 4@D|pg||
nt|othered1: right, so it was a serious effort, not something to mislead east|pg||
nt|ybob: easy 4@H here|pg||
nt|stewball: N not able to get the @h count|pg||
nt|kjadams: unfortunate defense.  I'd have liked to see how declared attacked spades for 1 loser|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly. you'll be in a good company getting one down in game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|andyv:  we are on board 31 after we played 32 first|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This time we are going to have a strange auction where both West and North make opening bids ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For E/W's system, see: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/cc/sh-ta.pdf|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S in open room made with a great help by opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  @s game based on distribution, not on power|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think most pairs would do better to agree 2NT is never natural in comp.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: sry ofc also lose 1@c|pg||
mb|p!|nt|sfoxa:  will NS manage to reach it?|pg||
nt|stewball: strip @cs and a duck a @s to N|pg||
nt|kjadams: since North did not make a takeout double, might be tough to play for 11 HCP|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 tens upgraded S hand, seemingly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H X -2 was worth 13 imps to NS on bd 11 when Lauria took off to 6NT!|pg||
nt|hedyg: the bidding there was 3@H-4@D-6NT-X|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not really - the datum is currently 2 IMPs for E/W on the deal |pg||
nt|xenya: strong pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: before after DBL North could, the second round, DBL again|pg||
mb|1C|nt|iceking: undo on W pass please|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in each round, 2 pairs have to split 60VP between them, 30:30 means  a draw|pg||
nt|hedyg: so there must have been some more fun|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  suppose, several EW will be in 3@c or even 4@c (S should compete), so this result isn't awful |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 5@D on - may need @S finesse|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like another tiny game |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm  for results and running scores|pg||
nt|rmb1: Traditional shape and values for take-out double !|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r8.htm for livescores|pg||
nt|kjadams: ducking spade to north loses when south has King.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  once more - don't pay much attention to the scores. it's pairs event with IMPs scoring|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D is Italian style 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did pass|pg||
nt|iceking: no undo?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: nope|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW should find their way to 5@d |pg||
nt|hedyg: double= a 2suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: another 4@H coming?|pg||
mb|d|nt|stewball: well in that case you play the Q:)|pg||
nt|kjadams: given the ace king of hearts, i'd error by tossing south in with spade.|pg||
nt|stewball: like i said,it required careful play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now NS can compete with 3@d, if N is brave enough|pg||
nt|stewball: looks like a normal 3@d bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  leading EW to the bold game|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c by S leaddirecting, rather than bidding 2@H with xxxx|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would have bid 2@H with the South hand :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and her Mom as well :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: After a XX, rebidding before parner has a chance to double is generally a warning to partner|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Many players would suugest that 2@C says that is the only suit I am playable in partner |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  from the other hand, in 3NT from W seat, N may choose @h honour for the first lead, allowing to make the contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  having spades, E has to concede to the partner's @h for playing game|pg||
nt|andyv:  13 tricks available|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT minors?hmmm or Rubensohlish?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N's dbl is near to promise 4 cards in @h, so our Moms would|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Will be hard for EW to reach 3NT now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|iceking: 2aces and 6-5 shape with void |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I was optimistic :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm with N in his decision. 14 points, but 5 cards suit and 10-s|pg||
nt|bobholl: now the battle is on @S vs @D |pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure that 1@s shows more than 4 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Yvan|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told 4@H= better @ss than @H but you play pd|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@D does not show 4 cards necessarily|pg||
nt|hedyg: so N brings the long @cs into the picture|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe he should have bid his suits naturally rather than 2NT?|pg||
nt|xenya: this time a good one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: At least on this layout|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Do they want to?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: strong pass by West - i don't know if it is possible to play so in all competitions |pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: and he won't go for 800. Silence is golden|pg||
nt|ybob: rare t out with single @H :) but works fine !|pg||
nt|hedyg: a matter of agreements|pg||
nt|kjadams: did 2H show values?|pg||
nt|hedyg: since over 2NT his pd's bid really doesnt tell him much|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: only @H lead defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  several pairs use Bergen raises in N position - could make it easier|pg||
nt|bobholl: X is i had @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: Volcker:" like i care"|pg||
nt|stewball: likley p/c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W is willing to compete so much|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: he did though avoid the 800 |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but they reached game, after all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  he was about to steal the contract from EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looking for 4cards in @s?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 2@c relay|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  game temptation...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  current results are here http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r13.htm|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Hard to reach 3NT on these cards|pg||
nt|xenya: yet E knows they have game-going values?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: might be their strategy against this arcane system.  What's your defense to 1@C?|pg||
nt|iceking: seems like there stragety is to not bid at all|pg||
nt|bvdahl: rehi, everyone. Had a sudden emergency, but now I should be back in business :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double as generic takeout, overcalls natural|pg||
nt|othered1: generic takeout of what?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: any suit|pg||
nt|iceking: majorish |pg||
nt|othered1: maybe west just didin't have a bid for th is specific pattern?|pg||
nt|iceking: dbl of 1@C usually played in sweden as takout with 4-4 in majors|pg||
nt|iceking: could always bid 1@S i doubt that means anything else then @S |pg||
nt|hedyg: especially since 1@d was a 3rd seat opening, i.e. could be weak|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS are already beyound their possibilities|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5 tricks to concede|pg||
nt|hedyg: a good time to pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: he "knows"|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I don't believe all this - I have sent a runner to the table to check|pg||
nt|hedyg: 7 anything is on|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Pls disregard the score you see Team 2 12 IMPs Team 1 0 IMPs. |pg||
nt|rmb1: Perhaps 2NT shows a maximum 10/11 in which case 3@D may be GF ,,, no its not|pg||
nt|bobholl: he hasn't passed yet :)|pg||
nt|sga1: seems -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: strange looking dbl by west|pg||
nt|jcwla: Need to have agreement about meaning of 3@S here: general GT, trump quality GT, 1-2-3 Stop, etc.  |pg||
nt|stewball: pass or correct|pg||
nt|jcwla: So many finesses, so little time.|pg||
nt|kjadams: spade finesse first since that has reentry if fails.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid game Game  - Vul Bonus being 500|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not a good round for EW|pg||
nt|mareczek: 5@c looks like sensible |pg||
nt|mareczek: contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer has to work hard to escape to 1 down only|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be he loses 3 @D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s was cold so np to go off|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  he got a chance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not at ll, but E can rely on several pts by partner - 1NT was passed by N |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W did well with such opening. these 10 points deserve it|pg||
nt|andyv:  hand a little too rich to open as a multi|pg||
nt|hedyg: after all this noise i feel let down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1C in North work very well - opps don't know id @C are 4th or 5th|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however a try by West need (my opinion) - so not pass but 2@C now to investigate|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  6@s as sacrifice may well lead to 7@d under pressure|pg||
nt|hedyg: after XX you know it is not your board so giving pd a leaddirector looks right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe so, but the end result of their auction is a very good one - so we need to credit that|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3N is down, however|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  to collect 9 tricks in 3@d is much easier than in 3NT|pg||
nt|kjadams: If north has king and ducks, back to guessing.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|iceking: he is very lucky not going minus  420 here vs his own 650  imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: "For the rich they sing."|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  wow! they are more ambitious |pg||
nt|mareczek: even after club lead it makes...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E has to establish @d s to win|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like their agreement worked as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  counting the 13th trick will be the key for E|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this opening, I do prefer to score -50 (or 100) in tiny game, than +170 ot +200 in dull partscore|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Chagas finess in @c helps, but W have to decide for|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, no, sorry, I'm wrong|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 6@h S is happy to dbl|pg||
nt|kjadams: Neet to shift to clubs and then back to diamonds to beat 4S.  Continuing D will not do it.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Are we heading for a major upset? Boye B's are hot favourites despite the 21 IMP handicap they sustained|pg||
nt|mareczek: E takes in hand, cashes @dA, crosses toi the dummy with @cQ, ruffs diamod high, draws trumps and concedes @d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now it's possible to score 4 ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|othered1: but some of us dont like to get our shorter suit into the auction as an initial action.  West likely thought he's have another chance, then just chose to "stay fixed."|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 5N|pg||
nt|andyv:  Gawrys too fast for me:)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can see 12 tricks... the 13th is hard to spot (the 6th @h)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: Some fix.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|iceking: Is there a link Roland to Boyes fan club|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Piotr Gawrys doesn't play much, but is very famous for both - sharp bridge mind and sharp tongue|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Sveta pointed out a creative 3 NT from W may also have worked on @HQ lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: the cards again lie well |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s return can create communication troubles, but slightly ones only|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bvdahl: I'd bet anything that Boye B would be winning after scoring the first 38 IMP's of the match|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|d5|pg||

pc|dT|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|kjadams: does not help to finesse spade if Diamonds 4-2|pg||

pc|sK|nt|bessi2: normal result for n-s but if I were to pick a pair most likely to score +620 it would be Lauria - Versace|pg||

pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  ok, next board please|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  looks like average, but each option - 10, 11 or 12 tricks - is possible |pg||
nt|kjadams: a puppet stayman auction.   Right system for these cards.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  rather not 10|pg||
nt|jcwla: Against big club if ever but in any case - what is the XX?  And still another X?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will signal for @c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and helping hand from defence looks unnatural|pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: doesn't that normally imply shortness in 4th suit?|pg||
nt|rnc: Cue, I'm told (sitting 2 mtrs from the table)|pg||
nt|iceking: good bidding with no extras w will bid 6@H now |pg||
nt|rnc: Should be short, in my opinion|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in the CR, EW used 5 bids to get to 4@h. Here they might use less than that to arrive in slam...|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 5 bidding rounds|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a comeback for Vintage.|pg||
nt|iceking: east bidding in closed room looks just surreal |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one doesn't looks very special|pg||
nt|sharkey: should be off as dummy very short of entries.....|pg||
nt|mareczek: they have found the contract which is difficult do double|pg||
nt|mareczek: East knows that they have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mareczek: should play spade after @cA|pg||
nt|mareczek: otherwise, declarer can play @sJ|pg||
nt|mareczek: and if W will not cash the spades, EW can be in troubles|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  to create problems for declarer,N have to lead opp's suit - @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @c lead appears helpful|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would you have passed throughout as S, Sveta?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first lead well choosen - E is known to have more points than W, so N hopes to find partner with some values|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even without @c swith now, declarer has to concede 4 tricks|pg||
nt|kjadams: Running the Jack in slam would be nominated for play of the tournament|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  5@d is good as well|pg||
nt|ybob: S prefer wait to bid NT if pd has H stiff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  well done!|pg||
nt|andyv:  this has not been a very good set for Brink and Drijver while Bessis and Volcker have been flawless|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont see how East can avoid @D loser|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  would have considering this option, but triple, not only twicr|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *twice, sorry|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, @s lead had worked as well|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but the most interesting point - this contract could be made|pg||
nt|mareczek: usually in this position East's bidding causes the most suspicions|pg||
nt|sga1: Hope don't get over board to 6@C|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW climbed on 3rd position - they have very good round indeed|pg||
nt|daman: cash the Ace   then run the Jack|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told "dynamic 1NT"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ybob: now pass|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|iceking: ok iam trying to see what extras W has someone help me|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good philosophy. Bid the contract that makes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @d split 3-3, one @d finess and one ruff is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Sorry, some problems with the connection|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: If the Vintage team advance the good news for us is that Hed and Andersson will be available as operators for future broadcasts :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: If it's Rosenkranz style I dislike it with the queen (even tho that is part of the book treatment).|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a great slam|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although we don't need them when we have William and Magnus. They are great!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what should be S's next move?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 of @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: or Q|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's great|pg||
nt|hedyg: Thomas is afraid of nothing :p|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10hcps out of 16 in opps suits|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  no dbl - no trouble, will S think seeing the dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: (every time i say that somebody tells me i am wrong and it is a wonderful slam)|pg||
nt|kjadams: But it would actually be the wrong play given no information.   QT + Q9 are twice as likely as just T9, so restricted choice would lead to misguess.|pg||
nt|daman: the "Dynamic 1NT" is a holdover from the Romex system|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sfoxa:  squeeze can really work, if S have been playing small @s at the first trick keeping 10@s as a menace at the table|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the hand is over before it starts|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  only @hA and @h continuation, but not here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  hands like these at least don't put a strain on declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big prize money. 1st place = $ 10,000, then 6,000, 4,000, 3,000, 2,000, 1,000. Money to 6 out of 16, not bad|pg||
nt|kjadams: Also T or 9 from T9xx is possible falsecard.|pg||
nt|daman: but with Romex it is only when you open 1NT|pg||
nt|daman: we can find many holdings to offset my premise|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnc: Don't forget there is a Consolation Cup too. But I might bench them to do the broadcasting... :):)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's strong willed of them -- I might be out the door, never to return (during this event.)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  but not this time, yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: can only get to dummy by playing @H - thus no ruff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  alas|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  helpful hand from defence?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not from this players, though|pg||
nt|sharkey: B has shown @C by X I think - S may contionue with @CK and more @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: *N|pg||
nt|kjadams: but it would be pretty to see the play :-)|pg||
nt|daman: it was just a thought ...."PROVIDED he pins the doubleton 109 of @H"|pg||
nt|kjadams: Did I hear a collective sigh of relief from the Polish fans after Easy final pass?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  start was good from both sides. let's see the next move |pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl might hurt the defense if W playes in 6@c and a low @s is led|pg||
nt|kjadams: Easts|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  this should end matters quickly|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W have to pick up ALL his luck and "being wizard" skills from previous boards to win this contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible. looks like "present in return" to NS rather|pg||
nt|sga1: I  agree.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: Gawrys showed fit and maximum for pass with @c control|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sga1: good lead and hope continues, no switch to small @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder why J@d was not played|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if 2@d is encouraging|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it would be helpful for N who has to continue small(!) @d now|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW couldn't stay out of slam in @cs in OR either... down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @s switch?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  is 5 high enough to be promoted? yes, it is. |pg||
nt|8252: hi|pg||
nt|bobholl: thomas had gldly missed his @D 9 :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  first attempt to gain 9th trick failed|pg||
nt|bobholl: gladly|pg||
nt|andyv:  It seems that S made this harder than it needed to be.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kjadams: unfortunate that North did not support diamonds at some point.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: regular count by N/S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  4 @d rounds force 4 discards from dummy, hence @c  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 7NT was bid twice on bd 15 so it is still a plus for EW in -1700!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|kjadams: those good hearts just too tempting.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: Q@D|pg||

pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Good defence - didnt even get a pitch on @SK...|pg||
nt|hedyg: missed the A@S now|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gawrys had to play @s back|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: but Gino has seen this play before|pg||
nt|kjadams: now declarer may have to pitch before knowing if hearts split.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rnc: Remember that both broadcasters are in the trailing team. (And they are still alive...as far as I can see)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  unfortunately, E didn't cash 2 @s tricks before @h lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  point of truth|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W couldn't afford to cash last trump|pg||
nt|garnetts: It seems like a total guess to me|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  +1|pg||
nt|hedyg: what did you expect George?|pg||
nt|kjadams: the spade 8 being high offers safe play for 5|pg||
nt|hedyg: max for 1@d ofc sry|pg||
nt|daman: in 5?     playing the AK :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  and now E is endplayed|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|bjacobs: 4@H is ok though isn't it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 4@H looks cold to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and 4@H seems to make also|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So 5@D was no phantom - pity it went down more than the value of game!|pg||
nt|xenya: you might try 7 though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: strong pass by west|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|rnc: In the above shown standings all hcp-IMP's are included|pg||

nt|jillan:  SO EW here started with 21 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: Simple weak NT auction, except that NS's NT can be opened on 4-4-4-1 hands.|pg||
mb|6N|nt|bvdahl: for a while I thought E was going to miss the @s suit, but they found it in the end.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnc: For the CC of N/S, pls check under Convention Cards at http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc11/fc_main_en.htm |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: with @D onside 3@S should have no problems |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7N are ON here bec must play the automatic squeeze @H K@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Agreed, but you cannot make the overtrick in 6NT, because you must play clubs early to establish the 12th trick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bvdahl: And 3@s seems very makeable|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: Well done by EW, if a bit high|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|rnc: E/W are playing rather natural ('Acolish' style)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: playing Nt by East can play for automatic squeeze|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny. There is a Swedish European Tour top golfer named Andersson Hed|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: And our appreciation goes to the SBF Ostra Mellansvenska district (Carl Ragnarsson) for putting this event on BBO|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|othered1: south has to avoid puntinig game here|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant see that happen|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like 9 tricks in @h is the highest spot for either side|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Final board of the set and many thanks to our excellent operator Erik Fryklund|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Thx all! Hope to see you all when we restart in 15 mins|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: wrong again |pg||
nt|bridge_one: same contract that in OR|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|othered1: And south didn't force game with his 7-loser hand|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, if N is ever to pass, he has to do so with that hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And well done to my fellow commentators Martin and Vladimir for navigating the strange system used by E/W|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation goes to the SBF Ostra Mellansvenska district (Carl Ragnarsson) for putting on this show|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|cK|nt|iceking: i wouldnt have bid 3@H here, for me S just 2 strong|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: small @C now is routine|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: only 6 tricks here?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: this 8-11 is enough for slam, having experimented with this range for openings myself, i know you need just as many tools to follow these bids as in standard methods|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bvdahl: 2 small spades is not a very good holding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very difficult to find the seven trick for N|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: W might need to unblock the @DK to avoid an endplay|pg||
nt|xenya: but W has just thrown away a trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, seam A@D best stop for N|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: best spot|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: I agree, south took a very conservative position|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but need to play A @D fast|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not at end :)|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: now late|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bvdahl: 4 small cards in minors are not so promising, perhaps?|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@D here !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to give at p the J second|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not discard small @d, so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can still make it on an endplay even if West unblocks @DK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: noe easy unblock the K|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Was difficult for Andersson to know that he threw a trick on the 3rd club|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly helps, Giorgio -- declarer gets a herat trick anyway|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|bvdahl: got a little help from his friends|pg||
