mb|4S|nt|lestergold: south says why bid my known 8 card fit when i will probaBLY BUY A LOW SINGLETON IN MY SUIT|pg||

pc|h8|nt|sybarra: really?|pg||
nt|xenya: so the defence seems to have thrown 2 tricks here|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|nt|santyclz: The auction called for a trump lead.  In addition, the more unbalanced opening leader's hand is, the more the trump lead is appropriate.  0 for 2.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
