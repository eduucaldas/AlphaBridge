nt|ady: good day all|pg||
nt|junaid: hello everyone again|pg||
nt|junaid: does this score include the carryover as well|pg||
nt|junaid: and does anyone know how much it was to begin with?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: this includes the carry over|pg||
nt|jcwla: Live from Karachi, the Pakistan Open Team National Trials.  Welcome to this second of five 12-board segments of the final, with Datasteel storming out to an early lead over Solox ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: through 20%.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|junaid: and this segment is like the 7th game of tennis set...candyland have to make some inroads, they cant afford to fall too far back|pg||
nt|ehsana: Tehsin plays for Data steel|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like a normal 4@S making 6 on the friendly layout.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|junaid: looks like a misundertanding right off the bat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: to me seems a difficult brd for both teams..anything can happen...declarer will face problems|pg||
nt|ady: west pass?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|junaid: please remember that NS are a first time partnership|pg||
nt|junaid: hello everyone|pg||
nt|junaid: welcome back for the 3rd segment|pg||
pc|hK|nt|junaid: a pretty light overcall by TM but thats his style and it has worked for him often enough|pg||
pc|h4|nt|junaid: and his partner should be surprised to find him w/ this hand|pg||
nt|junaid: should NOT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|junaid: works out well|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ehsana: 2Nt may end up in the red :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back|pg||
nt|jcwla: This hand right at the tip-top of the range for the 2@C-2NT rebid.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: plucky balance from east    |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|junaid: S plays namyats, N does not:)|pg||
nt|junaid: but 3NT should make for EW tho it will take play|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcwla: Barry Crane: "God deals you A-K so you don't have a lead problem."|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk3: Udspil fra Jxxx koster altid et stik|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT   but would have to play well on a spade lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|ebrok: men spar ud er også 9 stik. |pg||
nt|junaid: and a correct @c guess would even allow him to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|junaid: this could turn into an 11imp pickup for sabres|pg||
nt|tipu: this will be an interesting segment as we all expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: North telling E to just enjoy his game and not take any pressure :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: any bets on 4S by East:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tipu: rightly so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Karen Allison|pg||
mb|2H|nt|oosmanb: Surely cant be namyats, if South has AK@H... |pg||
mb|p|nt|tipu: W is a man likely to get under pressure in these situations|pg||

nt|tipu: Hello Karen|pg||
nt|tipu: but East is as cool as ice:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|oosmanb: But I guess if you agreed on a convention and it comes your way, you trust it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand   e/w 3@C|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|ehsana: 5D on too|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead should beat it and w/ trump control, TM will likely find the lead and then finding entry in N hand is not a matter of choice, only one option|pg||
nt|ehsana: 5D playable cntrct|pg||
nt|tipu: East Uzair Kamal is responsible for making a lit of good yougsters to excell |pg||
nt|tipu: lot |pg||
nt|Walddk4: West you mean|pg||
nt|jcwla: S elects to make the 3@C despite holding only six @C and a mediocre four-card @H suit on the side, finds a nice catch.  A pass might have kept NS out of the auction entirely, and ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: now a super-protective reopening double by E and N is in a happy place.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|junaid: nothing else makes sense...also, has no one every opened namyats missing the AK of trumps?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|oosmanb: No, by definition|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|tipu: yes West|pg||
nt|tipu: thnk God I mentioned the name Uzair I meant:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yasser Rahim|pg||
nt|yr: hi all|pg||
nt|tipu: welcome Yasir|pg||
nt|yr: a strange looking contract here,, 5@c is more normal|pg||
nt|kareno:  What was the 1@c bid?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yr: this should go down on accurate defence|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|ebrok: Det var en rigtig stor pas i øst!?|pg||
nt|junaid: even then, E can bank on @hs for @c pitches after 2 rounds of trumps...interesting play problem|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|oosmanb: However  NS might get lucky, since 4@S nor 5@C makes on the last board, on correct defence|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|ady: should be 10 tricks without spade lead|pg||

nt|yr: i really have no idea what wwas 1@c,,maybe a psych|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: true, but unless @s is played by N, there will be no @c lead and then W will have to shift to a @c after a high @d lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jillan:  dom Ã¤r lÃ¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥Ã¥ngsamma vid andra bordet|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: For Cricket Lovers...Zimbawi  9 for 2 in 4 overs  against Pakistan |pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzaa: allt är relativt :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: men Troberg-Knutsson är nog bland de långsammare paren i den här tillställningen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: little to make here    2@S  may or may not make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|junaid: and sibanda just hit a 4 off gul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hardly when West bid 2@D|pg||
nt|kareno:  5@c down on diamond ruff assuming north leads that or a heart.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ehsana: face savings pass of 2D by East|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe they play reversed minor openings?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: apologies for the lack of play on last brd, E/W's hands were dealt the other way round here|pg||
nt|yr: then maybe operator error|pg||
nt|tipu: another unlucky contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|junaid: well done by EW, not easy to reach...friendly black suits lie will allow it to make|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: Offshape double will not deter them.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|junaid: 9 top tricks here|pg||
nt|junaid: 10 now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think that's a very reasonable defence, after A@D, dummy is void in @h so no future there, you can see 10@C so pd might even be ruffing the first one|pg||
nt|ajq: this may be the 10th :)|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|kareno:  So are they dealt backwards in the CR also?  or is that a fouled board?|pg||

nt|ajq: the pair of Chandna and Liaqat have done very well during the round robin matches|pg||

nt|ady: 6NT  also look likely to make|pg||
nt|ady: can take 13 tricks on good heart view|pg||
nt|kareno:  can|pg||
nt|tipu: minor slam|pg||
mb|2H|an|4th suit forcing|nt|oosmanb: 4 of either major seems fine|pg||
nt|ehsana: a major game for E/W|pg||
nt|jcwla: A normal light opener here with A-A-K connected, I don't love 2NT with such woeful @D's but if ever this is the vul for it, 3@C looks like invitational or better values with @H's, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: and 5@C escapes without an ax.|pg||
nt|junaid: omg...trump leads are almost mandatory in such acutions|pg||
mb|d|nt|ehsana: 4S will be take n to teh Cleaners |pg||

mb|4S|nt|junaid: S hand tailor made for walsh, showing 4441 GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: strange double|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: S asked W if 4@h was weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: it would've ended up going to the cleaners if EW dbled, but that is not a clear at the table action|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: 3@d inquired about, alerted as natural|pg||

nt|yr: here comes the good old 4nt,,,,|pg||
nt|junaid: not that it would make a difference here|pg||
nt|junaid: since the contract is not dbld|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|ehsana: my humble opinion 4S bettr than 4H :)|pg||
nt|tipu: yes they did|pg||
nt|tipu: still have to guess the @c right|pg||
pc|h3|nt|junaid: even now they seem to be on their way to 6m...needs luck, but its there, minors breaking and one of the two red hooks on|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT has merit here as 6@D might fail with bad trump split and badly place with 6NT making |pg||
nt|vugraphzar: explained, rather than alerted|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|yr: its normal to play some sort of Kickback in minor suit slam auctions but NS here are from the old school|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|vugraphzar: 3@h sorry|pg||
nt|kareno:  Pitch on heart|pg||
nt|yr: the declarer is Very competent & id bet on him making this|pg||
nt|tipu: I meant @s|pg||
nt|tipu: thnx for correcting Karen|pg||
nt|junaid: N showed something like a 5431 and S chose to play game in a 4-3 fit at the 4 level rather than in 5@c...very reasonable from S's angle|pg||
pc|h2|nt|junaid: :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|ehsana: some systems can expose dual major holdings:)|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|ehsana: In 4S he had almost 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: no way of knowing which 4 is better during auction|pg||

nt|oosmanb: so lets call them both good contracts :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|junaid: thats another result DS can take to the bank|pg||

mb|p|nt|ehsana: anyone for 4H :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: In any case you're not establishing a trick for declarer by cashing K@H and are unblocking yourself, so I just dont see how it loses|pg||
nt|junaid: yes it is...w/ the @s in dummy, u dont know if pard's entry is the A or K and your own holding is such that if u play @s before @d u may set up their tricks there and if play @d ...|pg||
nt|junaid: before u may set up tricks there|pg||
nt|junaid: entry is usually not the only issue going thru your mind and sometimes that makes u do funny things at the table|pg||

nt|junaid: wonder what chandna is thinking|pg||

nt|ehsana: N/S  can go wrong again in abidding a major game|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: does'nt E get a @h ruff as well junaid bhai?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This was good for DS, Tullo opened 2@S @S + minor|pg||
nt|junaid: if they do, the 4@s going down is going to loom large on them|pg||
mb|p|nt|farrukh: As they say down 1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: effectively shutting out opponent's @H|pg||
nt|junaid: thats another good result for DS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: 11 easy tricks in spades for e/w  and 12 if defence slip|pg||
nt|yr: sabres were the underdogs in this semi final,,,i must say they have played really well until now|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 16, where S played a quiet 5@C-1 here, the same contract was doubled and down 3 on a trump lead in the CR - hence an even bigger lead for DS.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ehsana: another possible 4H :):)|pg||
nt|junaid: but remember there must have been some carryover for solox, so sabres have outscored them in this match so far|pg||
nt|junaid: its what they call a plus position...if a swing occurs, it will be in the favour of DS...unless of course if something unusual happens|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Yes this session is 21-3|pg||
nt|tipu: here it comes 11 Imp's in Brd   16 for Sabers|pg||
nt|yr: nobody was giving them even a remote chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: game in either black suit on for EW|pg||
nt|junaid: but it may get passed out in 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: right, neither does @d through work for an extra trick|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcwla: Matter of agreement - would expect it to be forcing one round for many or most.|pg||
nt|ajq: Chandna can re-value his hand and bid the game on his own|pg||
nt|junaid: i think he was always going to bid it, whether it makes or not|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|oosmanb: if 3@H was limit, it was a nice bid|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|junaid: nicely done again...now u just need to make it:)|pg||
nt|junaid: even 6@c is a good sc|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can save at the 6 level for 500|pg||
nt|tipu: yes and the reason for that was purely the way they qualified   by only 1 VP margin|pg||
pc|h2|nt|junaid: dont see any problems there though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|junaid: difficult for E to play S for 3 Js only|pg||
pc|hT|nt|junaid: the only possible entry in W hand could be the @sA|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Datasteel Vs Candyland 48 - 15|pg||
nt|yr: that result just goes on to prove MEcstroths famous words " there are a lot of ways to win imps with a plus 480/490"|pg||
nt|tipu: as anothe team lost their last match 25-01:)|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead will allow it to make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: It doesn't come into play here b/c EW happens to have the hand - but 2@C over 1@D and 2@D over 1@C are great bids that put tremendous pressure on even good opps - so often they are ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: faced with tough choices whether to pass, make an imperfect negative double, or fudge their strength to show their suit.|pg||
nt|ajq: good bidding, even if Spades are J to four, 5C can make|pg||

nt|tipu: if they would ve lost 25-02 they would ve gone through:(|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yr: mean while declarer plays another thin 1N contract|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|junaid: its usually not a good idea to ruff air, and here it will make life easy for declarer...since he'll now be almost sure of catching the @cK onside and w/ the @h friendly he'll ...|pg||
nt|junaid: canter home|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|junaid: that is a very strange line of play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|junaid: he needed to have the @ds set up to tempt N into letting his trumps get picked up|pg||

pc|c5|nt|oosmanb: agreed|pg||
nt|oosmanb: making +1 now infact|pg||
nt|yr: anything but a @c wud have led to 1|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|yr: now declarer has a chance|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|ehsana: only 11 despite this play of small dmnd|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: let me check some thing wrong here|pg||

nt|yr: maybe 5@d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yr: but 3N more likely|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|yr: @h 10 id guess|pg||
nt|yr: as a lead knowing E|pg||
