nt|Vugraphzfd: Kranyak/Deutsch/Michel just arrived.  clock down to 50 forthe first 8|pg||
nt|lc: We have the 2nd quarter (16 boards) of a Round of 16 Vanderbilt Match.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: EW playing "old-fashioned" and standard carding|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: A likely 4@S for N-S -- but very bad splits could cause trouble.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2D = 22-23 BAL or 8-8.5tricks unbal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: deutsch studying his hand after getting the explanation|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: zia writes 15-17 on pad, brink nods yes|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lc: Against 4@S West will have a tough opening lead choice -- I think only a @C would keep him alive to beat 4@S.|pg||
nt|peachy: It is common in Europe to have two strong openings, 2C and 2D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lc: Presumably South, not North, bid 3@S ?|pg||
nt|peachy: Trance and some other places|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: deutsch bid 3S|pg||
nt|peachy: *F|pg||
nt|lc: Wow.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I am not sure exactly what it shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: had some glitches in the 1st qtr but at this pace I can keep up|pg||
nt|lc: I guess we won't get to see the lead against 4@S.  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: score confirmed by players pending protest over board15|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lc: Incidentally, North (Thomas) is the son of South (Michel) -- for those wondering.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: No doubt, a Forcing Pass from North.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: deutsch nibbling on a sandwich - protest caused the other room to finish late|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: It would seem Deutsch can survive any lead against FIVE @S.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: folds his hand, takes another bite, points at 2H for explanation|pg||
nt|peachy: It would seem a defensive error is needed to allow five to make, unlikely :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: in no hurry despite the clock and the new slow play regulations|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: 2@S = 3 hearts and maximum|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia asking if either of them could have 4 spades on this auction.  dont know all the details of their method|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lc: Not an easy lead problem.  Any votes for @DQ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: at least one player on your side|pg||
nt|peachy: Larry, your crystall ball is working :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: zia: AKQ AKQ- you miscounted, that's for sure|pg||

nt|lc: I don't like 5-card weak 2's, but with this chunky suit and being 3rd-seat, fav -- anything goes.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: if he ruffs and ruffs the clubs good, north has more trumps than either of the other two hands :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: je signale aux spectateurs franco[hones qu'ils sont invites de me lancer des questions ou commentaires dans leur langue maternelle:)|pg||
nt|lc: Flat 17 opposite flat 15, so not obvious to reach 6 -- let's see if they do.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: very primey S hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2S doesn't show extra strength, just 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: What language is spoken in Monaco.  French, too?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: after the tray is passed back, zia asks who had @DJ|pg||
mb|4D|an|cuebid|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hearts are poor but controls very sexy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|lc: 2NT, presumably a forcing ask -- and 3NT showing balanced max.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the monegasques:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N also has good controls plus reasonably robust trumps. only flaw there is 4333|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thomas considerately writes his explanations and turns the sheet where deutsch and I can read it|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is the music will stop in 6@S|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lc: Nobody has any 10's or 9's -- usually that can tip the scales to staying lower.|pg||
nt|athene: hmm, that's interesting - according to textbooks of old, it's not the done thing to cue a shortage in partner's suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still I belive 2@D sat minimum force to 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: you are supposed to have an honour|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: brink scribbled something I can't read|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|an|1/4|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|athene: in these 2/1 auctions where no-one limits his hand you really need some sort of serious/non-serious bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: both hands have such crisp values i predict a slam, esp bec Thomas is an aggressive bidder|pg||
mb|5H|an|!SQ+!HK|nt|athene: otherwise it can be pretty hard for either player to know whether they are in slam/grand slam territory|pg||
nt|athene: maybe just asking for specific kings will do the job here, though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: brink folds his hand and sits up straight, studying the tray|pg||
nt|athene: if the hearts need to be ruffed good, much may depend on the strength of north's spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Grand will not be bidded I belive|pg||
nt|athene: you might need him to have the ten and like him to have the nine, for 7@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might wrong.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia yawns|pg||
nt|athene: south will be trying to play the hand through in his mind - always something you try to do in slam auctions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, clearly trying to take 13 tricks before contracting for them|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. if hearts are 4-1, will there be a big problem? if north had the @CK maybe you could throw a heart on that and still ruff them out|pg||
nt|athene: but if south fondly believes that 4@D = @DK, he might think he has a source of tricks there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: There you go!|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
mb|5N|nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry - of course that was brink thinking, hamman passed in tempo|pg||
nt|athene: the NS card does say serious NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: An easy opening lead problem, anyway -- for all it will gain West.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pick up the bidding cards then ask about the auction on both sides of screen|pg||
mb|6H|nt|lc: Does anyone know N-S opening 1NT range?  Presumably he had a max for 2@H.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: believe thomas said he had shown 12-14 balanced with 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: which means that with a good hand, north would bid 3nt over 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: so 4@D showed a minimum|pg||
nt|athene: 5NT asking for more, 6@H = @HK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 5@H already showed HK|pg||
nt|athene: now south knows pretty much exactly what he is facing i think|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes sorry|pg||
nt|athene: so 6@H must be the sixth heart|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec said: Might 6@C from Brink and 6@D N for bid 7.|pg||
nt|athene: so south knows he is facing @SQxxx @HAKxxxx and a diamond control|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and some willingness to cooperate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: kibitzers growing impatient.  hamman stoic|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|nt|lc: Looks like 15 to me.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, the spade spots were always going to be the problem - maybe the pause was south trying to think of some way he could ask about just the spade quality|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: but that was never going to be possible really because it's not even the jack he is interested in|pg||
nt|athene: they might reach it in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: drijver now gets his turn to work out the line for 13|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to follow all tables: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: riffles his cards and leans back, fans his cards then tosses them back onto the table|pg||
nt|athene: well he's fine on a decent heart break|pg||
nt|athene: @CA throwing club, @CA, heart to hand, club ruff, heart to hand, heart ruff, draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that zia will drop the @HQ on the first round just to make declarer unhappy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite good % anyway I belive William.|pg||
nt|athene: but the chances of success against 4-1 hearts are so low, i think you pretty much have to just discount that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: drijver coughs, mumbles "yeah", sits back again, riffles his cards, leans forward|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told Meckwell stopped in six|pg||
nt|athene: zia knows he is going to make this |pg||
nt|athene: almost for sure|pg||
nt|athene: but no harm letting him tire himself out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: clock on 34, no great hurry (yet)|pg||
nt|rodal f: % for 4-1 @H as 4-1@S is small. 4-1@H behind make problems. Odd on I belive.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: drijver shrugs, mumbles something.  can't read his lips, particularly if he's murmuring in dutch|pg||
nt|athene: it is worth noticing how useful the great trump spots are|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|athene: so there was a bit of good luck for NS|pg||

nt|tez: hi all|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||

nt|marlowepi: makes you pay bitterly. this is especially true of downgrading a "bad 1" to 1NT|pg||
nt|lc: On 20, where E-W played in only 2@S, Fantoni-Nunes opened a systemic 2@H and played there.  Not going well for Monaco.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bad 18|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|athene: when you are using a 4-4 trump fit for ruffing a suit good and getting back and forth you have to be very cautious about cashing any trumps just for the sake of it|pg||

pc|s2|nt|peachy: Well maybe he really should have a spade stopper for it , one minor detail|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|lc: Now they discussed this a few minutes ago.  Did they agree to play Nex X?|pg||
nt|lc: If not, 3@C could buy it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: kranyak advocated negX and deutsch seemed to agree|pg||
nt|lc: Or, will East bid 3@S and reach  the lucky 4@S?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfd: a trick did not get turned and I had to doublecheck what was happening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: agreed that defense gets a trick and making 5|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lc: If viewers are wondering why E-W in the Vandy R16 don't have sophisticated methods ---  Deutsch plays a very simple card -- nothing fancy.  I applaud that -- if you can't remember ...|pg||
nt|lc: lots of stuff, then KISS.|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if hamman would make that same double with the minors reversed?|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. is there some equal level conversion issue here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: given zia's explanation earlier he well might|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: kranyak: "no, you should pass, but when I reopen you could bid 4@S"|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||

nt|athene: before the trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: fanned his cards then folded them again, leaning forward with elbow on the table and chin in his hand.  shrugs.|pg||
nt|athene: zia could cash the @CA to get a suit preference card perhaps?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hamman by contrast is very still at the table|pg||
nt|athene: hamman tells him whether to play a diamond or a heart|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfd: kib recruited to turn dummy|pg||
nt|lc: So, this will pay off some 50's -- but it is N-S hand for hearts, so no big deal.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: there we are|pg||
nt|tez: zia led  k of @c because he has doubleton in @c..king and ace showing doubleton|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead AK reverse way round to show a doubleton, often, you want partner to say where his entry is so you can get a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but it can work just as well if you need to get him in to do something else|pg||
nt|athene: the problem now is that hamman has to work out that a heart back is needed rather than a club for a trump promotion|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hamman moves @H2 to the end of his hand, removes his glasses again to look at dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|lc: I'd think Michel would have played his @D in different order to show @S cards.  Unless the play U.D. S.P.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: good defence|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: brink sighs|pg||

nt|athene: hard to find a trump lead from AQ9|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|gavin:  wow, suprising pass from south|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|gavin:  Thomas doesn't even know the grief his father has spared him from|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4 tables in play 4 finished in this room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: zia often plays/bids instantly|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gavin:  just what you want to hear with north, a 3c opener from partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: h3 detached|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: having worked it out before it's his turn|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hamman: afraid the rot is beginning to sink in|pg||
nt|athene: not that easy a lead decision for north here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gavin:  north south have no chance at beating this due to lack of communication|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: kranyak apologizes for dummy as he puts it down|pg||
nt|gavin:  these tens and nines make this hand quite simple|pg||
nt|gavin:  the only thing east will need to be carefull with|pg||
nt|gavin:  is allowing north to establish a long trick in one of the red suits|pg||
nt|athene: @HJ not a bad shot i guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gavin:  on this actual hand ew dont even need a club trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thomas studying, still, not much expression|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: kranyak again very busy as dummy, moving around in his chair|pg||
nt|gavin:  i predict he plays low|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|gavin:  thought he would think his only chance at beating|pg||
nt|athene: brink can probably work out what is going on|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gavin:  was if the 7@S was indeed 4th best|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|tez: nice lead for defence|pg||
nt|athene: now @SAK and a heart back?|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: many would double with S hand but NS style is very active and at these colors 5 hearts somewhat less likely so SW judges primary upside is in minors|pg||
nt|tez: hard choice for rodwell|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: for results so far - http://www.bridgewinners.com/round-of-16|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4th quarter will start after a short break but not sure which matches will be shown|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i would assume that this will be one as it's still competitive|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|warrens:  7 of @C upside suit preference (I assume), so he's showing a @D honor or two|pg||
nt|warrens:  upside down, that is|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but of course as we all know...  assume makes a hindquarter out of u and me|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: last board of the set. clock on 49 so 4th quarter might have to wait a while|pg||
nt|athene: some might open that 3@S given the vulnerability but i would think it's much too strong in zia's style|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia mumbles: 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, maybe he is playing Hamman Style these days|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|peachy: Thanks kibitzers for your input, and specialthanks to the excellent commentators Larry Cohen and Gavin Wolpert|pg||
nt|athene: @H5 now|pg||
nt|athene: THAT would be a good lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfd: hamman: got a few tickets for you|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gavin:  ty|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: drijver: would be very aggressive bidding game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: drijver has not turned the trick, still looking at dummy.  again zia played from it the second it hit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: finally turned the CK and fanned his hand, still thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: drijver: hmmm|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|peachy: scores from all four matches will be available her as soon as they are finished|pg||
nt|gavin:  a good spot for a takeout double from deutsch, |pg||
nt|peachy: http://bridgewinners.com/round-of-16|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gavin:  he knows his partner does not have 3@H assuming they play support doubles|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfd: "I'll take it"|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|gavin:  looks like theres nothing north south could do, ew was destined for a plus after they bid on past 2@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: everyone else turns the trick, "can I see these once more?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: still searching for the 5th trick for the defense|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gavin:  they will go down a trick here |pg||
nt|gavin:  losing 2@H 1 eventual diamond, 1@S 1@C|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphzfd: this is the last table in play. still 14 on the clock|pg||
nt|athene: bit late for this to work now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: about 3 tricks too late in fact|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|athene: 3 tricks and a lot of sighing and humming :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia: how many tricks have I lost? 3?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: They all have heeded the new slow play regulations then :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: evening session begins at 8pm EDT|pg||
nt|athene: if he can afford to lose a spade he plays ace and another to minimize chances of a ruff|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: that was last board i think?|pg||
nt|tez: enjoyed..ty all:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: last board of the quarter.  other room on  46.  then will be 15-20 minutes break before 4th quarter|pg||
nt|tez: nice job William /John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks and thanks for your expert insight|pg||
nt|tez: in this last segment last round will be start soon|pg||
nt|tez: i dont know when|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director comes to claim the boards. "wish I knew who told them they get bonus points for making the messiest pile"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: helness having a laugh at the next table.  screen opens to reveal dummy, he exclaims "oh my god!" laughs again, "well I have chances".  room is otherwise silent, four tables still ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: in play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director tells kranyak's table: if you want to play all the boards, you'll have to play faster.  ACBL trumpeting slow play regulations this year.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: other room has finished.  closing down.  join us again for the finale|pg||
