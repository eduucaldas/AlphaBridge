nt|Vugraphzfc: welcome -- second half of the round of 8 match at the Vanderbilt in Louisville|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lc: Game for E-W (with 24 HCP) due to @CQ onside -- but not clear they will bid it.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lc: Light 3rd seat white opening fairly "normal" these days.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D shows a "normal" single raise|pg||
nt|lc: Weinstein not likely to appreciate his cards to raise to 4 here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Little does he know that the @HQJ are working.  The @C10 turns out to be a huge card.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|lc: It used to be that Meckwell were the  1 U.S. Pair and there was no  2.  It was a multi-way tie for  2-6.|pg||
nt|lc: But now, many feel that Levin-Weinstein are  2.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, there are others still in the discussion -- who might resent me declaring L-W as  2.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jillan:  Zia and Hamman maybe  >)(|pg||
nt|lc: Well, lots of talent there, but not nearly as much partnership history and understandings.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lc: Also in discussion would be:|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lc: Greco Hampson    Gitelman Moss    Martel Stansby|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hampson-greco|pg||
nt|lc: Certainly the longest-running would be Martel-Stansby -- about 30 years, I think.|pg||
nt|lc: Although Meckwell are close.|pg||
nt|lc: Meckwell started in the late 70's !|pg||
nt|lc: If anyone want me to talk about the play in 3@S, I apologize.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't look like it will be too challenging|pg||
nt|jillan:  noone does Larry |pg||
nt|lc: White at IMPs, there is no urgency to be in a game such as this -- a little worse than 50-50.|pg||
nt|lc: If VUL, it would be worthwhile -- but still hard to bid.|pg||
nt|lc: Take away the @C10 or even the @C9 and game is lousy.  Hard for players to diagnose such things -- no matter what the methods.|pg||

nt|lc: So, while we watch the boring 3@S, as there are new viewers out there, let's talk about the pairs a little more...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|lc: N-S, as I said a 30+ year partnership, use their own Strong @C system.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lc: Luckily, we have big-train, Walter Johnson, commentating with us -- he might know the system better than they do!|pg||
nt|lc: Meckwell are in many people's mind the best pair in the world.|pg||
nt|lc: E-W are Levin-Weinstein, a 10-year partnership.|pg||
nt|lc: They have been real hot of late -- with many big wins.|pg||
nt|lc: Throughout the past 10 years they have amazed by winning the presteigous Cavendish Pairs over and over.|pg||
nt|jillan:  I would think in 99% of all bridge players mind through out the world|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lc: 5 times, i think?  Anyone know?|pg||

nt|lc: I guess Levin is one of them.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|lc: Easy 4@S now|pg||
nt|lc: Nice to be white against Red -- otherwise, Weinstein's 4@S would be scary.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I guess not too tough.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jillan:  still scary, but I do not think he expects to win this|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, though, he can't be copmfortable passing with only 1 @S.  I guess he would need a 5-card suit to bid on the 5-level (and some shape).|pg||
nt|jillan:  just put pressure on the otehrs|pg||
nt|lc: So this looks like an easy 500 for N-S -- but do they have anything there way is the question?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose 5@D isn't bad.|pg||
nt|jillan:  but he may have bittenhis thumb here|pg||
nt|lc: Looks like with a @D and a @S to lose, it would come down to the hearts.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lc: Normal to play the hearts right (since you can pick up more heart splits if WEST has the @HQ), so I think 5@D would have been +600.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lc: Rodwell, had he bid, would have tried 4NT takeout, and Meck would have played 5@D.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lc: Meck planning a delayed 3@S (3-card raise), but probably was tempted to bid only 2@S opposite a white 1st seat opener.|pg||

pc|c7|nt|lc: I doubt Meck was happy about bidding 3@S (suspecting only 8 trumps).  Walter--I presume Rodwell could have doubled 2@C with shortness there (even if iminimum?)|pg||
nt|lc: Because, if South denied short clubs, North knows there are at most 16 trumps on this deal -- in which case bidding 3 on a flattish hand like North's (with lots of "junk" on the ...|pg||
nt|lc: side  @HJ  @DJ  @C10) feel anti-Law.|pg||
nt|lc: Although the guy does have 68,000 masterpoints.|pg||

nt|lc: I would be happy to have 16 partscore deals for a set of deals.  As a player.  Not as a commentator or writer, though.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfd: dummy hits.  hamman: "oh well"|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|chorush: Hamman is concerned that 3NT was a make. And it might be|pg||
nt|jbgood: or was it "not so well"?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia spreads dummy's clubs halfway across the table.  fleisher asks if he can straighten them.  zia: put them wherever you want - kamil and kibitzers have a laugh|pg||
nt|wstuart: Note that Hamman was content that his vlaues were expressed by the simple 3@D bid in competition.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hamman takes his glasses off, says "well" again, still planning|pg||
nt|wstuart: I see many players who bid 3@D on very minimal values regularly, but when they have a goodish hand, they have no way to bid it.|pg||
nt|chorush: I'm not sure that is true. I don't know what dbl of 2H would mean as they play|pg||
nt|jbgood: quite a few would have bid 1 NT instead of 2@d on Zia's hand. Perhaps he regrets it . in the post mortem|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: kamil bobs his head to some rhtyhm only he can hear|pg||
nt|chorush: 5 clubs is a good contract that would be done in by the 4-0 break. If they tap Hamman hand by making him ruff a heart kamil gets a third club trick in 5 clubs|pg||

nt|jbgood: still I think Hamman would get 2 spades .5 diamonds a club and a heart?|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|lc: I think 3rd seat 1NT is 15-17 here, so 18-19 makes sense.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  would they want to find hearts both hands being 4-3-3-3?|pg||
nt|lc: The seven from dummy looks like a useful play here!|pg||
nt|lc: If dummy plays low, the 6 forces the 10 and then East has a @H trick.|pg||
nt|lc: If the 7 is played, then N-S have 4 @H tricks.|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lc: Meck -- you are too fast.  But good!!!!|pg||
nt|lc: Nice play.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lc: Probably the 7 couldn't hurt but could only help.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Jeff is now up to eight tricks|pg||
nt|lc: As to how Levin feels now, that is why I am happy to be in retirement.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, @S would have worked much better.|pg||
nt|lc: But, he just led 4th from longest and strongest.|pg||
nt|lc: Actually, I didn't let such things like that bother me much.  You can't worry about those things.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Larry, what 3 pitches do you think Weinstein will make?|pg||
nt|lc: You just lead 4th best and don't zig and zag and luck will even out (you'd think).|pg||
nt|emre kaya: normalde böyle laflar edemem belki:)|pg||
nt|emre kaya: sry|pg||
nt|lc: Oh -- Weinstein has to make 3 pitches?  Against 3NT by Meck? That is another reason I am happily retired. :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  lol|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lc: Let's see -- Probably he can painlessly throw spades -- I'd think he has to keep @C and @D.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|casenjo:  Larry, your audience wants you to unretire|pg||
nt|lc: Usually, though, you try to pitch from the 5-card suit not right away -- because it tends to give it away when you throw one immediately (something about the idle 5th).|pg||
nt|lc: If they want me to unretire, I can't do Vugraph. :)  Maybe that's why they want it. :) :)|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, Levin can give only so much help by the order in which he is playing his hearts.|pg||
nt|lc: You would think Weinstein would have to guard both minors with his hand  -- although, surely, a @S discard could easily be fatal on many layouts of that suit.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lc: So, where there are 8 tricks, there are usually 9. This looks complicated.|pg||
nt|lc: Bob Hamman, Jeff Meckstroth -- those are the players who have been here a thousand times -- and you would want at the wheel in this situation.|pg||
nt|lc: Whereas the average player can't even remember the discards, Meck will not only know the discards, but be able to read something into them (table feel).|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Jeff is usually a very fast player, but will take his time on this one|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|lc: There is a good chance he suspects the actual remaining shapes.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lc: Potential endplay positions all over the place -- and everyone knows this is 10-12 big IMPs at stake in a close match.|pg||
nt|lc: I feel the intensity from here.|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, most viewers know they can click GIB -- and know that declarer "can" prevail.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: even Rodwell (dummy) seems to be thinking hard |pg||
nt|lc: Even looking at all 4 hands, though, it is not obvious which plays work -- so for Meck, single dummy, this is quite a challenge.|pg||
nt|lc: 3 suits in play -- and all 3 have endplay potential.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  on King of spades and a spade won't Weinstein be squeezed?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lc: Weinstein will win and play a @S, you would think.|pg||
nt|lc: Weinstein doesn't want to break either minor, so a @S is straightforward -- but maybe he is thinking of tactical reasons to try something else.|pg||
nt|lc: Many of you may know, that Weinstein is one of the world's best Poker players.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|lc: And that is a poker-like play.|pg||
nt|lc: The straight-forward spade would have made things more interesting.  Now we are done.|pg||
nt|lc: What might he have been thinking?  I can't say I see it.|pg||
nt|lc: Meck did do quite well to play the @D9 and not the @D7 -- and quickly, too.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|casenjo:  perhaps he was following Bobby Levin's order of heart spots, he did signal for diamonds|pg||

nt|athene: north got a heart lead against 3nt in the other room (they never investigated hearts)|pg||

nt|bigtrain: back from picking up dinner... i miss anything?  :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|lc: But, no need to, as Meck has an obvious 3@S bid with his shape -- doesn't want to defend a 3-level contract.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lc: So, apparently 39 is being played in the awful 4@H at the other table, which means Nickell is about to take the lead.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  39 was a big pickup for Nickell after they went down 2 in 4 hearts|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, responder to 1@C (the 18-count) showed @H (in effect) and North "raised" to 3@H -- nobody ever got off the heart train into notrump.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  wonder why Weinstein didn'[t continue clubs with 4 trump|pg||
nt|lc: Still, we can't expectg 3NT would have made -- especailly without a helpful @H lead.|pg||
nt|lc: I think he saw that it wouldn't help, since the @CJ would set up and be a stopper.|pg||
nt|lc: One of the hardest things to do in bridge, is to refocus after the awful taste -600 on the previous board.|pg||
nt|lc: Levin-Weinstein have to get that out of their head and focus on the final 25 boards of this match or they can get run over.  |pg||
nt|lc: anyone can concentrate/focus when things go well.  When they go poorly, it is a test of mental stamina and discipline.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  good time to get up from the table to get a glass of water|pg||
nt|lc: Many a player succombs to this phenomenom -- which is why Meckwell so often steamroll opponents.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  works for me :)|pg||
nt|lc: In a long match, they invartiably get a roll of a few thin +600's and +620's -- and often the world caves in after that for the opponents.|pg||
nt|lc: So, it is a good sign to see Levin digging in hard here against 3@S -- I'd expect nothing less.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|casenjo:  that's why they call a timeout in football or basketball, when the other team is on a roll|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s8|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lc: Neither defender knows for sure the nature of declarer's 3@S bid -- or that the @D are running.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's been my experience that you steel yourself before the match to have a couple of gigglers against the boys and that helps when they actually come up|pg||
mc|9|nt|lc: Yup -- good idea Walter.|pg||
nt|lc: This is quite a line-up for a quarterfinal  2 vs.  7 match.|pg||
nt|lc: Smoking break?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: short break|pg||
nt|casenjo:  looks like they took my advice for a water break|pg||
nt|lc: Water?   Smokey water, I think.  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they had planned a brief break after 8 bds|pg||
nt|lc: 3 smokers -- all probably desparate by now.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  only for Meckstroth|pg||
nt|lc: Rodwell is the only one who might be going for water.|pg||

nt|casenjo:  good idea|pg||
nt|bigtrain: does anyone have the site address for the streaming video?|pg||
nt|lc: David would be so mopey about that -600 in 3NT -- I would have to play psychologist and calm him down.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lc: What percent of players in the Round of 8 would open 2@S with East?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: I am not one of them, but I'd guess about half.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is limit raise or better|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bigtrain: with a 4+fit|pg||
nt|lc: They are already way too high :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D is an artificial game try|pg||
nt|lc: Based on what? :)|pg||
nt|lc: His good looks?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: his boyish charm?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Is 3 Jacks good in bridge?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lc: They can make 1@H -- and are trying for 4@H.|pg||
nt|lc: Duplication of values and all 4 jacks turn out to be wasted.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  people have been asking me ab out the seeding|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck does have a minimum LR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I can comment on the seeding as we watch 3@H go down 1 or 2.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|casenjo:  if you look at the bracket sheet, the number in () is the original seed number|pg||
nt|lc: Everyone has "seeding Points" -- earned on merit over the years.|pg||
nt|lc: Foreigners are sometimes awarded points if they haven't been playing much in U.S.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lc: Most you can have is 50 (all 4 players at this table have 50).|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the defenders are the '1' seed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lc: Each team is averaged and seeded according to their number of seeding points.|pg||
nt|lc: 3-4  and  5-8  and 9-12, etc. get shuffled.|pg||

nt|casenjo:  another question: can anyone play in the Vanderbilt?|pg||
nt|lc: I'm told the method of seeding foreigners is still evolving -- but obviously you have to give seeding points if the top player in Country X enteres the Spingold.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|casenjo:  the only requirement is to be a life master|pg||
nt|lc: I think you need 100 masterpoints to enter.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lc: Anyway, one thing about seeding points is they decay. You lose 10% a year.  Mine are eroding as I sit here typing  :(|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jillan:  mine to....|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Master Mixed team requirement is 100 ponts|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think the big teams is different, but could be wrong|pg||
nt|lc: Usually you get a few very inexperienced teams who enter just for the thrill - with no real chance --  but they get to maybe play 64 boards against world-class players. Not bad.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I have been told that the Vanderbilt is an 'open KO' and anyone can play, but the Spingold is a 'Life Master KO'|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Again, I am being corrrected: POKER and FENCING|pg||
nt|lc: Fencing?|pg||
nt|jillan:  fencing?|pg||
nt|poohbear: fencing?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  so I'm told, but I've certainly never participated|pg||
nt|lc: Although, I have to say, I wouldn't want to compete against the world's best, in say, boxing!  :(|pg||
nt|jillan:  Poker I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Weinstein wondering where is the "game try" -- but he didn't open 1NT (is that 14-16)/|pg||
nt|jillan:  croquet a kibbitzer says|pg||
nt|poohbear: and curling|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, i assume 3@H will be 2 down for 1 IMP to Fleisher.|pg||
nt|lc: Many people I know whine and complain when they have to play against the best.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Now, CHESS and CURLING have been added to the list|pg||
nt|poohbear: not clear . If weinstein thinks the @c k with declarer then he will exit a @d|pg||
nt|jillan:  equestrian|pg||
nt|lc: No fair -- you've been watching the play?|pg||
nt|lc: When I started duplicate bridge (1970's) there were no FLights, no Junior games, etc.  I got to play the best all the time (in NY area).|pg||
nt|jillan:  hahaha, one kibbitzer said  although "sit down" is questionable for most of these|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: zia asking kamil about the board while fleisher decides how/whether to come in|pg||

mb|3H|an|mixed raise|nt|lc: Now some sort of 3-level bid -- a Mixed Raise?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H is a "mixed" raise|pg||
nt|lc: These days, with 9 trumps, most pairs know to get it to the 3-level ASAP and make it tough on the opps.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|warrens:  does X by W now show @H's? or just cards?|pg||
nt|lc: The thinking is you have 3-level saftey with 9 trumps, so just do it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Double now -- probably cards, I;d think.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lc: Weinstein didn't want to bid 4@H -- but there was no room.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lc: So, it looks as if the bad trump split will doom this -- Rodwell just has to tap declarer in @S to get a 2nd heart trick and the @DAK.|pg||
nt|lc: Similar to Board 38.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: a mixed raise is 4+card fit for the major and about 8-9 dummy points|pg||
nt|lc: With less, he'd have bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: basically a 4-fit single raise|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lc: Some people describe MIXED as: "more than a preempt, less than limit."|pg||
nt|lc: It is a nice tool -- but I find most of my students forget it (forget to use it, and forget when partner uses it).|pg||
nt|lc: I know a spec who is watching (i won't name him) who always forgets it.  :) :)|pg||
nt|lc: In case anyone thinks they can remember it, the Mixed Raise is used when: Partner overcalls, and you jump-cue bid the opponents suit on the 3-level.|pg||

nt|casenjo:  they were in 4 spades down 1 at the other table|pg||
nt|lc: By putting your Cursor over "Closed Room" you see a similar auction, but North bid 4@S over 4@H.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell doesn't play bergen raises as most know them...  3@C and 3@D would have different meanings here|pg||
nt|lc: There is a motto to always bid "4@S over 4@H" -- but Meck suspected it would be -500, so probably wasn't tempted (event though it would have been down only 1)>|pg||

nt|athene: 4@H is quite aggressive|pg||
nt|chorush: Certainly perfectly reasonable to bid 3|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|chorush: He might. We will never find out|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Im sure he will bid 4 spades here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was worried his partner might pass a 2@S raise with a minimum hand but heart fit and they could miss 4M|pg||
nt|athene: but surely 2@S is the normal action|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: zia says if hamman bids a suit over 3Nt it should be a cuebid for spades.  fleisher then asks kamil how they play it|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: zia very fast again - not one to take time making plans - fleisher has to ask to see the spots again|pg||
nt|athene: south might duck this to give declarer a losing option - he could then try a low spade playing for Ax / Jxx|pg||
nt|athene: but he shouldn't do that because with Ax the defender should not duck the queen|pg||
nt|athene: it would just be a grosvenor|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3 called but 2 played|pg||
nt|athene: if anyone is not sure about "grosvenor" - the basic idea is, you should not play for a defender to have done something "wrong"|pg||
nt|athene: so|pg||
nt|athene: let's say south did duck the @SQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia: "I thought you were showing out!" when kamil took @SA|pg||
nt|athene: you should still continue with the king from hand, not a little one|pg||
nt|athene: because if the ace was doubleton, they could always have got 2 tricks legitimately anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so you never lose by it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|athene: what you want to avoid is losing 2 tricks where you "shouldn't" with best play all round|pg||
mc|11|nt|Vugraphzfd: everyone clusters around to check the score.  that's all for now, back in maybe 20 minutes|pg||
