nt|Vugraphzfd: Kranyak/Deutsch/Michel just arrived.  clock down to 50 forthe first 8|pg||
nt|lc: We have the 2nd quarter (16 boards) of a Round of 16 Vanderbilt Match.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: EW playing "old-fashioned" and standard carding|pg||
mb|2D!|an|strong but not GF|nt|lc: A likely 4@S for N-S -- but very bad splits could cause trouble.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2D = 22-23 BAL or 8-8.5tricks unbal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: deutsch studying his hand after getting the explanation|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|an|forced|mb|p|mb|2S|an|!S|nt|lc: Against 4@S West will have a tough opening lead choice -- I think only a @C would keep him alive to beat 4@S.|pg||
nt|peachy: It is common in Europe to have two strong openings, 2C and 2D|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4S|nt|lc: Presumably South, not North, bid 3@S ?|pg||
nt|peachy: Trance and some other places|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: deutsch bid 3S|pg||
nt|peachy: *F|pg||
nt|lc: Wow.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I am not sure exactly what it shows|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Vugraphzfd: had some glitches in the 1st qtr but at this pace I can keep up|pg||
nt|lc: I guess we won't get to see the lead against 4@S.  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: score confirmed by players pending protest over board15|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Incidentally, North (Thomas) is the son of South (Michel) -- for those wondering.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: No doubt, a Forcing Pass from North.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: deutsch nibbling on a sandwich - protest caused the other room to finish late|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: It would seem Deutsch can survive any lead against FIVE @S.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: folds his hand, takes another bite, points at 2H for explanation|pg||
nt|peachy: It would seem a defensive error is needed to allow five to make, unlikely :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: in no hurry despite the clock and the new slow play regulations|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|lc: Not an easy lead problem.  Any votes for @DQ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|harmon: as kibs pointed out he couldve ruffed with the 4 and not wasted the 6|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: EW system uses ALL 1-level opening bids as 1 round force  usually 14+ HCP|pg||

nt|hedyg: OR 5@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: no double|pg||
nt|hedyg: W opened a weak 2 @H there|pg||
nt|chorush: This seems to me to be asking too much of double: to show spades with or without extras?|pg||
nt|chorush: Pass is an incipient disaster|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Strul was leading by 72-26 after the first quarter. Remarkable comeback by Lall in the second|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chorush: trumps are best but 303 clubs will probably let him survive|pg||
nt|hedyg: well pd bid a vulnerable 3@d, this is doesnt cost more than bidding 4@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: but pass..|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt S would have doubled if he thought his pd would pass|pg||
nt|chorush: If Fantoni wins in hand and ducks a club, defense has to stitch to tapping dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room Larry Cohen commenting on West Opening   "As Marty Bergen used to tell me: "3rd seat Fav is not bridge.""|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and others confirm Fantoni didn't really promise 10 HCP here -- just less than 1@H opening|pg||
nt|hedyg: E in OR bid 4@H on 3@D and S flew to 5@D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: but still only 7 of top [current] 16 seeds leading at the half|pg||
nt|jbennet: agree fully and the  1 NT opening got what it deserved with 2 open suits and no tenaces what soever  opening 1 NT will most often only achieve a) confirming alfa male status. and ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there are still a few who open 1@C with 55 blacks -- when strong enough to jump shift on 2nd round|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: NS from 2010 European  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|harmon: 7c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|friggi: this one fits the decription|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other side of the spectrum -- opening 1@C/@D DENIES 5@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: But they did not play much together since|pg||
nt|chorush: that is on the high side of 10-13|pg||
nt|hedyg: W is surely maximum for his 2@H bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=10-13, 5+@H unbal [6322 = unbal] NOT 4+@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=11-16 HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Q3 results at http://bridgewinners.com/round-of-32|pg||
nt|harmon: I dont agree clubs are not good enuff|pg||
nt|harmon: change ace of d for club then yes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: last announcement:  other room is visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|c6|nt|harmon: 4d probably kc|pg||
nt|harmon: in clubs I hope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I agree Harmon -- this isn't right hand even if system allows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kool option would be 4@D asks KC in BOTH suits|pg||
nt|harmon: it might|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2n was again 11-14 with 3 spades -- i can't read what 4D is|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 11-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N max, not 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For instance, they now play transfer responses to 1@C. They did not in 2007|pg||
pc|h7|nt|harmon: not a good leaner Joe??|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: both pairs use upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|chorush: I have some doubts about doing this with a 5 card side suit but who can dispute their results?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: they may well do, but was this really the auction?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: he decided not to upgrade, didnt like Qx in @s?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|swanson: This is one of those hand where you want to get the king of the dangerous suit on opening lead - tough to develope a system for that.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Horrible as defender to see that spade combination in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have all been there|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems a normal line to win and play a club to the ace and another|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: declarer long pause|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer is not certain how to avoid losing a trick in each suit plus a ruff.  If he plays trumps early his only certain entry to dummy is gone.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: certainly not playing too quickly at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: random guess   4@D=denial cue   slam interest but NO @D card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  i'm not sure if 10-11 can open 2@H with 4@S  --- but 12-13 4@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|harmon: hard to recover from 2n|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|harmon: natural auction works better here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the treatment does seem to eat up a lot of space when holding only 3-fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4@D showed 4 clubs and a certain number of key cards -- not sure of the definition of key card here|pg||
nt|harmon: then 6s was a lazy bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: that sounds like a system that might have got them to the grand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: it is puzzling, isn't it David|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d all pass I could understand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh   4@D SHOWING key cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe if @DA was @CA instead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|swanson: Sorry - thought it was passed out in 3@C.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tlc: that cant be right..|pg||
nt|dburn: and was this really the play?|pg||
nt|hedyg: even with 11 hcps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: I expected 3@C to end auction too John  --  guess it becomes constructive after 2@D   for THIS pair|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Saælensminde probably winning the king now|pg||
nt|tlc: 2D is inv or better and with 15, hard to turn down invite|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then he has 96 still|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, it's true that the honors were in the rwong suit(s)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: singleton Ace - greatly overrated for offense|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: or Q@S Q@c|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: well guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry, figity mouse here, moves by itself|pg||
nt|Walddk4: np|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's the ghost of terence reese|pg||
nt|dburn: you're not supposed to play the ten with this suit, and surely Villas-Boas knows it|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: Two winning lines. He can set up clubs and rely on the heart finesse, or he can play a spade first|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Icelanders are relaying  7th round of bidding and they're only at 4@H right now|pg||

nt|lc: A good 6@H here for N-S.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the monegasques:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N also has good controls plus reasonably robust trumps. only flaw there is 4333|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thomas considerately writes his explanations and turns the sheet where deutsch and I can read it|pg||
mb|4C|an|cue|nt|lc: Nobody has any 10's or 9's -- usually that can tip the scales to staying lower.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: both hands have such crisp values i predict a slam, esp bec Thomas is an aggressive bidder|pg||

nt|lc: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: An easy opening lead problem, anyway -- for all it will gain West.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|lc: Does anyone know N-S opening 1NT range?  Presumably he had a max for 2@H.|pg||

nt|chorush: Looks like a routine 6 hearts here|pg||

nt|jbgood: first segment Nunes opened 2 @s - next man bid 3 @h and Fantoni 3 @s - 4 @h and all pass - were cold for 5 spades... seems the intermediate opener has its weak points - or is it ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: just judgement?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: makes you pay bitterly. this is especially true of downgrading a "bad 1" to 1NT|pg||
nt|lc: On 20, where E-W played in only 2@S, Fantoni-Nunes opened a systemic 2@H and played there.  Not going well for Monaco.|pg||

mb|4C|nt|lc: Well, East was a passed hand.  There must be something between 2@C and 3NT. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Well maybe he really should have a spade stopper for it , one minor detail|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe 3NT was a tactical bid -- West knows N-S likely have big @S fit -- and he can always run to 4@C if doubled.|pg||

mb|p|nt|warrens:  why pull 2@S X?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@C by E..|pg||
nt|chorush: If the spade K is led it will be down 2. Likely down 2 even on heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without interference  2@S was 1-round force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after the dbl -- who knows :(|pg||
pc|sK|nt|harmon: Im analysing good you would be proud|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Duboin 2N would have been INV -- i wonder how that differs from 2@H|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|chorush: Jonsson is fortunate the the club 9 is doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my! Michel Bessis (S) in OR bid 4@S!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jfaria:  strange... with N hand I would be happy to transfer and pray :)|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps he asked his partner whether he had any spades, and then decided to open anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th seat 1N=15-17  so  Justin showing 12-14  [probably WOULD pass with only 11]|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: mopping of Brazilian brow - East could not have been too keen on the way things were going|pg||
nt|harmon: rpobably lead a spade here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D9 makes slam sooooo close    but i think best is 6@D EAST|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: kranyak asking questions quietly on his side of the screen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also in 3N -- with Jonsson responding 1@H |pg||
nt|harmon: thats a strAnge response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: establishing game force with 2@C has a lot going for it -- especially when you define opener's rebids|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lc: Unless he opened light with 1@S.|pg||
nt|peachy: Much of the bridge playing world has adopted that style|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: commenting because he seems to offer tells to his screenmate with his mannerisms|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, if this deal were played at 10 tables, I'd expect E-W to get into spades (4@S over 4@H) at 9 of them.  This is the 10th -- and will almost surely send a swing to Monaco.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lc: Also, if declarer plays @H first and West fires back a diamond, declarer could conceivable go wrong by rising ace (in case the opening lead was from @DKxx.).|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|c9|pg||

mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2 or 3?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW use that 2@H bid only NV    when Vul  2@H = 5+@H & 4+@C/@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes, different according to vul|pg||
nt|warrens:  2 or 3 @D by W now (allowing partner to correct to the blacks)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D or 3@D??|pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  Warren got there 1st|pg||
nt|chorush: The tactic of using crash is for responder to bid as high as he feels like in the suit he would like least if responder held that color|pg||
nt|chorush: so here, if opener holds reds, Fantoni would like to get to 3 diamonds. When Nunes corrects, he will bid 4 pades|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: that was then and this is now... down two is customary, and down three undoubled is almost a triumph|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|harmon: instead of par monaco scored a birdie|pg||
nt|warrens:  why did N pass over 3@D (or did we miss a bid)?|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange|pg||
nt|chorush: Im not sure. I know I would have bid 3 hearts|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: tricky, this|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: since 4@h is down on the normal diamond lead from South|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: he did pass over 3@D|pg||
nt|chorush: Specs are asking how 4 hearts fails. I dont know the answer|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H is on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: maybe with min he passes, even with 4 hearts|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@H doesn't make with @D ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: @D lead beats|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: and not at all clear what declarer's best shot it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spot card leads against NT presumably ATTITUDE |pg||
nt|ahollan1: might have selected @S3 instead of @S5 to prevent Sementa from trying to find help anywhere else  |pg||
nt|dburn: he could have succeeded by winning the first spade, or he could have looked very silly by so doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he knows that holding 13 HCP|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: or Deutsch bogey -- hit into the trap    [oy - sorry about that]|pg||
pc|h2|nt|swanson: Declarer can establish a club for a diamond discard, but no quick entry to use it.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: that should not beat 4?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|ritong: he has a throw in plan|pg||
nt|dburn: doubtless involving a towel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Henri -- that's another option that doesn't work|pg||
nt|ritong: unless brogeland cooperates|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i'm ashamed to admit -- i don't remember if Brogeland won Bermuda Bowl with this or a different partner|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Helgemo-Helness, Brogeland-Sælensminde, Grøtheim-Tundal|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Neat hand. Diamonds are frozen for the defence|pg||
nt|tlc: however west can rise with the spade K on the first lead and cause a problem|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer might well judge to make this, expecting hearts 3-1 offside.  Establishes spades before trying to ruff diamonds.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if declarer ducks -- no convenient @H return from East|pg||

nt|ahollan1: south never bid in the other room   but i doubt that affects the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer must be careful to preserve transportation to pull 4th round of trump without having winning @D ruffed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @SA must be onside|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: on 25, kranyak played HA at trick 12 and I misentered it for whoever was confused|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|3C|nt|lc: Now they discussed this a few minutes ago.  Did they agree to play Nex X?|pg||
nt|lc: If not, 3@C could buy it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: kranyak advocated negX and deutsch seemed to agree|pg||
nt|lc: Or, will East bid 3@S and reach  the lucky 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: If viewers are wondering why E-W in the Vandy R16 don't have sophisticated methods ---  Deutsch plays a very simple card -- nothing fancy.  I applaud that -- if you can't remember ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: likely|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, I'm not quite sure how he made six|pg||
nt|ritong: Q10 and A 10 are attractive holdings to receive the lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: from 2007    Support DBL only thru 2@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Kranyak checking to see all hands from same board|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but never fewer than 0|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ritong: as geo tislevoll underlines, any hold em hand is dangerous:)|pg||
nt|swanson: This time South holds 3-card support AND a good hand.  Difficult problem now.|pg||
nt|ritong: brogeland would prefer @s x and @c Axx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course, playing 4-deal [chicago] bridge   sometimes it is right to open that garbage to "steal the vulnerability"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice Duboin did NOT bypass @D to bid that bad 4-card @S suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: isn't it actually 0-11 HCP?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi everybody|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ritong: stiff aces are not as pretty as our intermediate/advanced specs might think|pg||
nt|tlc: not sure how they made 6 at the other tbl..|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: newer players think south trump holding GREAT when partner transfer shows 5+ but as you see @SK & @SJ are redundant here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the term often used is  "trump poor"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stronger hands bid at 2-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: short break here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fantoni not surprised until dummy comes down -- Nunes response to 2N was 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone remember -- is this [renamed] Zimmermann team intact from last year's win, or did Fantunes replace a different 3rd pair?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: daily bulletins at http://www.acbl.org/nabc/index.php?a=2011&b=Spring&c=daily_bulletins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure one of them lists defenders of all events from last year|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helgemo-Helness as 3rd pair sounds right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: back|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ybob: cold 3NT, any def, 1@S work fine here|pg||
nt|dburn: they got a ruff and discard when East was in with @cA|pg||
nt|tlc: well, then.that would do it|pg||
nt|dburn: which allowed them to establish a trick in whichever suit they pitched from the South hand|pg||
nt|ritong: 6 welcomed imps|pg||
nt|ritong: i am asked by several persons, so i try to develop) a bit|pg||
nt|ritong: stiff ace looks cute because it represent absolute control|pg||
nt|ritong: but|pg||
nt|ritong: especially in opponent's raised suit|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not an " active" card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room is on final board of the segment [48]|pg||
nt|tlc: well,,then with absolute control and 15-17..no 1NT opening??|pg||
nt|ritong: you have absolute control, but no use to develop tricks with it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no time trouble here at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 46 minutes on clock|pg||
nt|ritong: and, even i f i m not fond of hcp scale, a stiff ace is worth 4 points, not more not less|pg||
nt|tlc: with 6 more bds to play this qtr|pg||
nt|chorush: Fantoni will pick up spades even faster than he normally would given North's bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 11+ is 2 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: and gf|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ybob: hi |pg||
pc|c8|nt|ybob: over 2@S W could bid 2NT |pg||
nt|peachy: West has a little more than can be expected by E|pg||
nt|ybob: super max after the pass over 1@S|pg||
nt|peachy: Pass on 1S was a little conservative, IMO|pg||
nt|ybob: W could bid the same over 2@C with xxx KJ10x  xxxx  xx|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|dburn: well, he seems to have bypassed 3NT because of that bad spade suit|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: since boards are NOT duplicated across matches -- if teams finish early, they can restart early|pg||
nt|dburn: at single dummy, of course, Brogeland isn't cold for five, so he has something about which to think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: typically 15 minute break after final board complete|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 65 minutes for 8  boards|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: and all options work since @C & @H both 33|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 3@S was a "last train" attempt to get to 3N   or maybe artificially showed @H shortness??|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c6|pc|s5|nt|dburn: maybe Duboin expected Sementa to bid 3NT with his actual hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|swanson: It looks like declarer needs either the C!A onside or 3-3 clubs - he doesn't have time to check everything.|pg||
nt|swanson: @CA|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like making 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Fantoni asking what 1@C - 2@C by Baldursoon would have been|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s + 5@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: or ?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|dburn: not that 3NT would necessarily have made, of course, but I had expected it to be the final contract|pg||

nt|chorush: Id be on the move if I were Baldursson|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: THIRD SEAT 1@c MIGHT HAVE WORKED WONDERS|pg||
nt|ybob: now if 2@C Drury fit, S can X|pg||
nt|peachy: Sorry, Caps, oops|pg||
nt|ybob: i like 1@C from S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nunes opened North a systemic 2@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: they probably have a general agreement that doubling an artificial bid shows the suit|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer can still succeed by going up with the queen on a spade lead to a top honor and a low spade back|pg||
nt|kerasidis: known?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, he might not|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: then i think defense slipped a trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Nice swing here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: showing 10-13 HCP, unbal [6@S or 5@S and not 4+@H]|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: 5@d would have been really amusing|pg||
nt|dburn: ...so this is a somewhat fortunate gain for Strul, who would have lost a lot of IMPs if the diamond finesse had been right|pg||
nt|chorush: all roads seem to lead to a push|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||

nt|hedyg: and in a bit over 2 hours segment 3 and 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: we will be back at 8:00 local time; 2 hours and 10 min from now|pg||
nt|chorush: a rather short dinner break since play resumes in 1 hr: 42 minutes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: impossible because west has not more than 13 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: yes john|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: P-P-1@H-2N//  some form of unusual vs unusual?|pg||

mb|d|nt|ritong: awkward hand for hemant|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: what he did might work pretty well|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just 3@H competitive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or ..... PASS  nope didn't really think about that one|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ybob: hard bid to W  now, pass or X ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: though surely one of his opponents will bid soon...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Multon's hand really does have great defense rather than offense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: good|pg||
nt|ybob: now 5@D|pg||
nt|peachy: Kib asked what if they didn't bid game after 2C is doubled?  The loss would be negligible 1 imp of they stayed un partscore while 4S making on any other lead would have been big|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: because of suit openings at 1 and 2 level -- 1N covers some shapes that seem foreign to us mortals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but always 12-14 HCP|pg||

nt|hedyg: http://bridgewinners.com/round-of-16|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: ...or maybe they won't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 2@D opener is Precision [3-suit short @D] so this is only way to show weak 2  --  unlike NS who use 2@D for really weak and 2@H/@S as constructive|pg||
nt|ritong: nice pot stealing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: still 15 minutes on the clock|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: 2@C-2@D Gazzilli|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 3@D specifically showed @S|pg||
