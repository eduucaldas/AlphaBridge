nt|junaid: hi all, welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: welcome from a very hot and sunny karachi:)|pg||
nt|ehsana: both these teams ahve been winners however today it seems data steel is running all ove candyland|pg||
nt|ehsana: thye mean it is their product name :)|pg||
nt|ehsana: Tahir Massood and Jawad is a new partnership|pg||
nt|ady: good day all|pg||
nt|junaid: hello everyone again|pg||
nt|junaid: does this score include the carryover as well|pg||
nt|junaid: and does anyone know how much it was to begin with?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: this includes the carry over|pg||
nt|jcwla: Live from Karachi, the Pakistan Open Team National Trials.  Welcome to this second of five 12-board segments of the final, with Datasteel storming out to an early lead over Solox ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: through 20%.|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: and this segment is like the 7th game of tennis set...candyland have to make some inroads, they cant afford to fall too far back|pg||
nt|ehsana: Tehsin plays for Data steel|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like a normal 4@S making 6 on the friendly layout.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|junaid: looks like a misundertanding right off the bat|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ehsana: to me seems a difficult brd for both teams..anything can happen...declarer will face problems|pg||
nt|ady: west pass?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|junaid: please remember that NS are a first time partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: a pretty light overcall by TM but thats his style and it has worked for him often enough|pg||
mb|3H|nt|junaid: and his partner should be surprised to find him w/ this hand|pg||
nt|junaid: should NOT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|junaid: works out well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: 2Nt may end up in the red :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back|pg||
nt|jcwla: This hand right at the tip-top of the range for the 2@C-2NT rebid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: plucky balance from east    |pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|junaid: S plays namyats, N does not:)|pg||

nt|ebrok: men spar ud er også 9 stik. |pg||
nt|junaid: and a correct @c guess would even allow him to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|junaid: this could turn into an 11imp pickup for sabres|pg||
nt|tipu: this will be an interesting segment as we all expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: North telling E to just enjoy his game and not take any pressure :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: any bets on 4S by East:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tipu: rightly so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Karen Allison|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Surely cant be namyats, if South has AK@H... |pg||
mb|p|nt|tipu: W is a man likely to get under pressure in these situations|pg||

nt|tipu: Hello Karen|pg||
nt|tipu: but East is as cool as ice:)|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand   e/w 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ehsana: 5D on too|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead should beat it and w/ trump control, TM will likely find the lead and then finding entry in N hand is not a matter of choice, only one option|pg||
nt|ehsana: 5D playable cntrct|pg||
nt|tipu: East Uzair Kamal is responsible for making a lit of good yougsters to excell |pg||
nt|tipu: lot |pg||
nt|Walddk4: West you mean|pg||
nt|jcwla: S elects to make the 3@C despite holding only six @C and a mediocre four-card @H suit on the side, finds a nice catch.  A pass might have kept NS out of the auction entirely, and ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: now a super-protective reopening double by E and N is in a happy place.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|junaid: nothing else makes sense...also, has no one every opened namyats missing the AK of trumps?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oosmanb: No, by definition|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tipu: yes West|pg||

nt|tipu: welcome Yasir|pg||
nt|yr: a strange looking contract here,, 5@c is more normal|pg||
nt|kareno:  What was the 1@c bid?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|yr: this should go down on accurate defence|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|ebrok: Det var en rigtig stor pas i øst!?|pg||
nt|junaid: even then, E can bank on @hs for @c pitches after 2 rounds of trumps...interesting play problem|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oosmanb: However  NS might get lucky, since 4@S nor 5@C makes on the last board, on correct defence|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|ady: should be 10 tricks without spade lead|pg||

nt|yr: i really have no idea what wwas 1@c,,maybe a psych|pg||
mb|1S|nt|junaid: true, but unless @s is played by N, there will be no @c lead and then W will have to shift to a @c after a high @d lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|ehsana: For Cricket Lovers...Zimbawi  9 for 2 in 4 overs  against Pakistan |pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzaa: allt är relativt :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: men Troberg-Knutsson är nog bland de långsammare paren i den här tillställningen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: little to make here    2@S  may or may not make|pg||
mb|2N|nt|junaid: and sibanda just hit a 4 off gul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hardly when West bid 2@D|pg||
nt|kareno:  5@c down on diamond ruff assuming north leads that or a heart.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ehsana: face savings pass of 2D by East|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe they play reversed minor openings?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: apologies for the lack of play on last brd, E/W's hands were dealt the other way round here|pg||
nt|yr: then maybe operator error|pg||
nt|tipu: another unlucky contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Offshape double will not deter them.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|junaid: 9 top tricks here|pg||
nt|junaid: 10 now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|oosmanb: I think that's a very reasonable defence, after A@D, dummy is void in @h so no future there, you can see 10@C so pd might even be ruffing the first one|pg||
nt|ajq: this may be the 10th :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Like Junaid bhai predicted 4@S defence wasnt easy :)|pg||
nt|ehsana: yes nicely played by wajaha|pg||
nt|yr: i think he played too quickly|pg||
nt|tipu: fine contract but unlucky|pg||
nt|kareno:  Not unlucky, tipu.  misplayed it.|pg||
nt|yr: he has loads of talent as a declarer|pg||
nt|tipu: lacked a backup plan|pg||
nt|yr: so im disappointed by tha effort|pg||
nt|tipu: agreed|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|oosmanb: But cashing AK@D was pretty unimaginative...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|oosmanb: dont know what he thought his other 2 tricks would be|pg||
nt|ehsana: 3NT a possiblity for E/W|pg||

nt|ehsana: .......4S great..play will also be interesting|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think most would have chosen 3@S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tipu: unlucky in a sense as @c hook is either way he guessed it wrong|pg||
nt|yr: !2 lead|pg||
nt|yr: @c 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: i was wrong:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ehsana: 10 tricks available in Clubs for E/W|pg||

nt|jcwla: A quiet pass here from S.|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|jillan:  Jag skulle ha vÃ¤ldigt svÃ¥rt att bjuda 3@H med Pias kort|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ehsana: 4H and 3Nt  both possible with N/S|pg||
nt|junaid: 5@d should be reachable now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: no, E prefers to play a possible 4-3 fit when he should know that a 5-3 or better exists|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ajq: even 4H should be making easily|pg||
nt|jcwla: W elects not to go to war with just K-fourth opposite E's shortness and they've chosen the @H game which can come home.|pg||

nt|ady: weak 2  or multi South?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: discussions among both partnerships before proceeding to the next board|pg||

nt|ady: no problems here    might even make 10 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1@D certainly can't be accused of overbidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: :) I was wondering if you multiply your scale by 10 for the fun of it|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Would be interesting,, 150-170 1NT :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Just to confuse the opponents|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|oosmanb: @D seems to be the best suit. pip wise|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|ehsana: question is how many down :)|pg||
nt|yr: but the problem with this for a normal partnership is u have to pass a 1@s response,,,not so much for them as they play 1@s response to 1@h as 5+|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|junaid: this should lose 2@c, 1@s and 1@d|pg||

nt|oosmanb: South should cash K@H before that exit, |pg||

pc|s9|nt|oosmanb: South could be caught on an endplay if North ducks this trick|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and if he overtakes he's himself endplayed|pg||

nt|oosmanb: In any case you're not establishing a trick for declarer by cashing K@H and are unblocking yourself, so I just dont see how it loses|pg||
nt|junaid: yes it is...w/ the @s in dummy, u dont know if pard's entry is the A or K and your own holding is such that if u play @s before @d u may set up their tricks there and if play @d ...|pg||
nt|junaid: before u may set up tricks there|pg||
nt|junaid: entry is usually not the only issue going thru your mind and sometimes that makes u do funny things at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I like 4@H at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|junaid: yes, nice bid|pg||
nt|junaid: wonder what chandna is thinking|pg||
nt|oosmanb: In the other room South had a chance to bring this 3NT home but didnt take it |pg||

pc|dK|nt|oosmanb: Still only 8 tricks|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Some nice hands so far|pg||
nt|ehsana: 1 Imp difference ONLY :)..not comfy|pg||
nt|junaid: actually no, the same tricks, as in, no difference|pg||
nt|ehsana: N/S  can go wrong again in abidding a major game|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: does'nt E get a @h ruff as well junaid bhai?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This was good for DS, Tullo opened 2@S @S + minor|pg||
mb|1D|nt|farrukh: As they say down 1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: effectively shutting out opponent's @H|pg||
nt|junaid: thats another good result for DS|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: 11 easy tricks in spades for e/w  and 12 if defence slip|pg||
nt|yr: sabres were the underdogs in this semi final,,,i must say they have played really well until now|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 16, where S played a quiet 5@C-1 here, the same contract was doubled and down 3 on a trump lead in the CR - hence an even bigger lead for DS.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ehsana: another possible 4H :):)|pg||
nt|junaid: but remember there must have been some carryover for solox, so sabres have outscored them in this match so far|pg||
nt|junaid: its what they call a plus position...if a swing occurs, it will be in the favour of DS...unless of course if something unusual happens|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oosmanb: Yes this session is 21-3|pg||
nt|tipu: here it comes 11 Imp's in Brd   16 for Sabers|pg||
nt|yr: nobody was giving them even a remote chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: game in either black suit on for EW|pg||
nt|junaid: but it may get passed out in 2@s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|junaid: right, neither does @d through work for an extra trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Matter of agreement - would expect it to be forcing one round for many or most.|pg||
nt|ajq: Chandna can re-value his hand and bid the game on his own|pg||
nt|junaid: i think he was always going to bid it, whether it makes or not|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: if 3@H was limit, it was a nice bid|pg||
mb|5C|nt|junaid: nicely done again...now u just need to make it:)|pg||
nt|junaid: even 6@c is a good sc|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can save at the 6 level for 500|pg||
nt|tipu: yes and the reason for that was purely the way they qualified   by only 1 VP margin|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: dont see any problems there though|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: difficult for E to play S for 3 Js only|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: the only possible entry in W hand could be the @sA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzkt: Datasteel Vs Candyland 48 - 15|pg||
nt|yr: that result just goes on to prove MEcstroths famous words " there are a lot of ways to win imps with a plus 480/490"|pg||
nt|tipu: as anothe team lost their last match 25-01:)|pg||
nt|junaid: @d lead will allow it to make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: It doesn't come into play here b/c EW happens to have the hand - but 2@C over 1@D and 2@D over 1@C are great bids that put tremendous pressure on even good opps - so often they are ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: faced with tough choices whether to pass, make an imperfect negative double, or fudge their strength to show their suit.|pg||
nt|ajq: good bidding, even if Spades are J to four, 5C can make|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

nt|junaid: of course|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yr: the result on brd 16 i mean|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|ehsana: strange play |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|oosmanb: hmmm I dont know about the 2@S lead.. perhaps 10 to ask for @D if pd wins the trick?|pg||
nt|tipu: if they would ve lost 25-02 they would ve gone through:(|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|yr: mean while declarer plays another thin 1N contract|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|junaid: its usually not a good idea to ruff air, and here it will make life easy for declarer...since he'll now be almost sure of catching the @cK onside and w/ the @h friendly he'll ...|pg||
nt|junaid: canter home|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|junaid: that is a very strange line of play|pg||
pc|s7|nt|junaid: he needed to have the @ds set up to tempt N into letting his trumps get picked up|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: agreed|pg||
nt|oosmanb: making +1 now infact|pg||
nt|yr: anything but a @c wud have led to 1|pg||
nt|junaid: but this may get ducked because S may have trouble counting the hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yr: now declarer has a chance|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h2|nt|ehsana: only 11 despite this play of small dmnd|pg||
nt|junaid: but W could see the A in his hand, so after the @d ruff he should cater to E holding @hAx|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kareno:  Spade now.  No guts, no glory|pg||
nt|ajq: yes, no safety play :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|nt|yr: as simple as playing a @s to the king|pg||

nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
mc|10|nt|junaid: he had it made, even now...just continue @ss and profit from the lucky lie of the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: E realised the mistake right after asking dummy to play @c and claimed 1 off|pg||

nt|vugraphzaa: vi gör ett hopp bland brickorna för att få in lite resultat från slutna|pg||
nt|junaid: that play is almost impossible to find on the table auction...unless S reverses, W will not have the inspiration to defend it that way|pg||
nt|ehsana: some mess up on this brd is being sorted out |pg||
nt|vugraphzar: the hands as i can see are the opposite on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: E has W's cards and N has S's|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk3: så får vi sammenligninger igen, når vi vender tilbage til spil 15|pg||

nt|ehsana: pass 14 ponts|pg||
nt|junaid: is that pass correct Qasim?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: let me check some thing wrong here|pg||
nt|junaid: on 30 3NT proved too difficult to beat after a @d lead...W needs to bang down the @hA to beat it when he wins the @cA|pg||
nt|yr: maybe 5@d|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yr: but 3N more likely|pg||
nt|kareno:  3nt more likelu|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 6@D is very decent  I think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not making here..|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 4@H      hav e to play more carefully|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Det er blevet et populært interval, 10-13|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Der må væfre en årsag, det må jeg ha' studeret|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Fantunes bruger det også|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: i Sverige kallas öppningen för Askeröd och är Arnes favoritkonvention|pg||
nt|ehsana: any slam will be hard work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: actually 6@d not that good|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: certainly 2@H and a diamond to lose in 4@H   and 4-1 break awkward|pg||
nt|ajq: Heart lead can sink the contract|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|yr: @h 10 id guess|pg||
nt|yr: as a lead knowing E|pg||
pc|h8|nt|junaid: well...it needs @ds to break for starters...and then either, if no @ds losers u need to hold @s losers to 1, and if a @d loser then u have to play @ss for no losers...|pg||
nt|junaid: so dont think 6@d is such a hot contract|pg||
nt|yr: there it is!|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yup|pg||

nt|junaid: ouch...thats a big bid facing shortness|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ehsana: scoop S10 6S may make :)|pg||
nt|junaid: the lack of partnership understanding is clear...bd 13 and now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Well I can see the problem|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its whether you play checkback here or not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and what the implies about 3@S |pg||
nt|ady: I see the 6@D was a swing to Solox    5@D played in CR|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: accident here      bad score for Sabres|pg||

nt|junaid: this one was the only really good board at the other table...nice lead and defence|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|junaid: i wouldnt say not befitting a final, because the final is a pressure game and that can crack a lot of people...but the standard could've been better|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: any comments on pass by W on 35?|pg||
nt|yr: so then,, last brd coming up at this table|pg||
nt|jcwla: The nice @H lead against 3NT is gonna be too little too late.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Last board of the segment now - thanks to all.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This should be a pickup for Solox as DS found a way to post a minus on this layout.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahlnil0: Fin start , nu är Pia stensur :(|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Reagerer hon så där?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Shit happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: Hon ler iaf inte|pg||
mb|p|nt|tipu: yeah if you dont open 1NT dont think you still have to show extras later on just treat it normally|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ebrok: Hvad mon det koster? Ø-W kan ikke rigtigt vinde noget og slap u-doblet|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: EW did well to get to 4@S here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yr: E upgrades to a strong Nt & now will run to 2@c|pg||
nt|yr: well west runs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ady: seems closed room well behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: I like 2@S instead of 1@S more, if playing weak jumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|junaid: yes, @s lead gives nothing away while developing own tricks and the other suits not kind...good result in CR|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|yr: S is in dbling gear:)|pg||
nt|tipu: ohh|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ebrok: ja, det koster nok det gode humør!|pg||
nt|junaid: but why would u lead a @s when u have 5@h|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno:  Trying to thank Hamza :)|pg||
nt|tipu: had to pas 2@d for a sure plus here|pg||
nt|yr: but thats the problem u see, best to pass 2@d & take a SURE plus!|pg||
nt|kareno:  For his excellent job!|pg||
nt|junaid: 10 or 11 badly needed imps for solox|pg||
nt|ajq: at last some good news for Solox on the last board of this round|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|junaid: a good reason is that holding a wk hand, its quite often a good move to start w/ your 4 card suit because u're more likely to find help from partner there|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jillan:  trots att de Ã¤r sÃ¥ samspelta sÃ¥ hÃ¤nder det saker|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Thanks everyone for joining us|pg||
nt|oosmanb: We should have the next very soon|pg||

nt|ehsana: scroll back.........determination :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|junaid: E knows pard doesnt have the @hj, so pitching a @h was safe|pg||
nt|junaid: now dec has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzar: my pleasure|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|junaid: that @d discard was fatal to the defense|pg||
nt|ehsana: sucidal !!|pg||

nt|junaid: let me check|pg||
