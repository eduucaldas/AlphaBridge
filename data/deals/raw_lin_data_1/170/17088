nt|brolucius: I heard about a great defense from Zia this morning. His partner, who had opened 4H led the @HA against a slam. Dummy went down with a singleton and Zia false-carded the @HK from ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: @HK-x. Declarer ruffed the next round high from A-K-Q-x and Zia's J-x-x in trumps was promoted. Brilliant!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|hedyg: eventually the scores from all matches will show here : http://www.bridgewinners.com/round-of-8|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: already some excitement, 6@d was made in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some commotion as other tables restart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss still studying.  deck may seem to have too many points in it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hamman had only a sevn-card suit but it might easily have been 8-card.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann asks about 4D.  Gitelman writes: "I think splinter"|pg||
mb|4N|nt|yuval10: 5NT is interesting, of course in standart bridge it means to pick between 6 or 7, but it doesn't seem likely considering West' strength|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess North might bid 4NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: West leaps to 4@S rather than tip his hand with a cue-bid response. Interesting. He makes life more difficult for N/S that way.|pg||
nt|dburn: intending to convert clubs to diamonds to show 6-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: with 5-5, he would bid diamonds at once|pg||

mb|5H|nt|vugraphzfe: fingering @DA and @DQ|pg||

nt|dburn: as it is, diamonds may play better than hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "sorry if this was wrong"|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 6@d actually a lot better than 6NT, you can make it even when the K@h is off ( playing small @s from hand towards the Q, then if south doesn't jump you discard the K@s over the 4th ...|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c and if he does you can discard 2 @h's )|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess that after the ruff, Grue can pick up the hearts|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|brolucius: Spade switch is clear, but West can give a suit preference card anyway.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: here you have to rely on the @h finesse, but it worked so 2 imps for diamond |pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: South must've been convinced that his Partner has void @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: on surface it looks like N's double meant to discourage his Partner of carry on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although if the kibitzers had to pay they would probably be less tolerant of the mistakes that the commentators make.|pg||
nt|dburn: optimistic, that - should South really have both majors stopped and the ace of clubs?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|dburn: still, this lead may let him escape for down only one|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some question whether the 84-44 carryover is correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol no Liz|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is E/W bidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't make it with these cards, but maybe has more chance on the actual borad 3|pg||

nt|brolucius: Even if one of the majors was bare, West might have made an unlucky choice of lead. It was adventurous bidding by N/S that could have worked better.|pg||
nt|dburn: true, and I guess if South had a couple of aces, the unstopped major might well be 4-4 anyway|pg||

nt|yuval10: double-dummy 6@h looks quite fair, but not today|pg||

nt|ritong: any 16+ hand is opened 1@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The East hand is worth an extra point, with those controls and the five-card spades.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the convention card that I am looking at, 2NT shows only 20-21. That's puzzling.|pg||
nt|dburn: Cheek may well lead a heart, which will work rather well for him|pg||

nt|hedyg: if 2@s showed 6-5...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: no could have been only 4 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't agree that it should show 5-6 (on the basis that North has denied four spades). That is a reasonable auction to describe a strong 4-6 hand. |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: this contract has a lot of play|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h looks makeable, so Schwartz team likely gets some imps back|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman studying the trick before turning it|pg||
nt|ritong: trump looks clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: then why bid 3@H?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|ritong: 7|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: brad has doubled, and not with a trump stack|pg||
nt|ritong: so he has values, including @h control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann lowers screen, asks about carding, gitelman answers UDCA|pg||
nt|dburn: he doesn't have a bad hand for hearts, or so he hopes - that @sJ would be a working card, and he has an ace|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|algraves: down 2 or 3 it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, 3@d is pretty much bound to be hopeless unless partner miraculously has two of them|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever for Lauria to double, as I see it. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: ron tried a small @h to his stiff jack, but unfortunately moss was aware about that card|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: no clear reason to give up on trump attack|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lauria said he miscounted last hand, thought he had 21|pg||

pc|d5|pc|h8|pg||

nt|bg: now if S ruffs a dia he cannot get off dummy without E playng another dia but he can discarf a club now Fred doent have anther dia|pg||
nt|ritong: far sighted, bruce|pg||
nt|yuval10: other room has already played twice as many boards as played here|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|algraves: Lauria played too quickly there as it was clear to not play a third spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: they prolly have a tool to show 5@s 4@h limit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they are joking that it might go all pass at othe table|pg||
nt|dburn: but 6@s is pretty good - not straightforward to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks good for a splinter bid.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: that too|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|bg: yes 2h =5spades 4 hearts|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yuval10: West in the OR chose 1NT after South decided to open 1@d|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ritong: possible 11 tricks  let s see|pg||
nt|marinesa: many pairs play 2h is 5s,4h 0-9 and 2s is 5s,4h and 10-11 something in this range|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|marinesa: especially precision pairs|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D shows a mixed raise.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: on the previous hand that is|pg||
nt|algraves: a lot of work to do in slam , KX spades is very favourable of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: a joke it is for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: any shortness, 3@H ask and 3@S= singleton @C|pg||
nt|dburn: to say nothing of 4-3 diamonds with the king right, and the heart finesse on should North lead the suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that this method appears on their card.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ritong: the @h 9 had for purpose to diagnose if south has a stiff honor|pg||
nt|ritong: noone would cover with Hx(x)|pg||

nt|yuval10: bye|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is not the only facetious one around this table, seems|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well bid, anyway. They are over the first hurdle of a two-hurdle-race.|pg||
nt|algraves: so all reasonable lines of play will work it seems|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: 3@D= fit and a singleton. 3@H asking etc|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|vugraphzfe: fred asked about 3H and brad asked about 3D but I didn't get conclusive answers|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: a limited hand, no more than 4-5 controls|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is reassuring when he takes so long to work out the best plan. Makes you want to give up the game when they pick up 12 tricks without pausing for breath.|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not easy|pg||
nt|algraves: lol, very complicated if you are trying to make with spades 3-1 as you would like to ruff 3 clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: he may start @cA, club ruff, @dQ intending to pitch a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: or, I suppose, he may just take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: don't see any other serious runners, but far from clear which of those two is favourite|pg||
nt|harmon: I think he needs the ht finesse, but I let better analysts decide|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he may be thinking of heart finesse and then if that works to finesse club with fall back on 2-2 spades with king on side|pg||
nt|brolucius: East did choose the splinter bid art the other table and, as you see, they have netted 1430 at the other table. If you put your cursor over the result, you can see the auction.|pg||
nt|algraves: first really big hand of the match as slam may not be bid in other room|pg||
nt|algraves: oh i see|pg||
nt|algraves: that is a great feature|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump lead made it a bit easier.|pg||

nt|harmon: Q of d my prediction|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: that may come now|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders will be muttering to themselves under their breath. 'How many finesses is this guy going to take?!'|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s lead in OR|pg||
nt|harmon: ok Q of d now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ruff a @c first|pg||
nt|brolucius: The famous English player, Jeremy Flint, used to advise that you commit a huge amount of energy to the important boards. Operation Big Deal. That is exactly what Versace is doing.|pg||
nt|dburn: ace of hearts also not impossible, just to see whether he needs a heart pitch at all, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that's probably too risky if the king doesn't drop|pg||
