nt|Walddk3: Commentators are Jim Griffin and Peter Lund|pg||
nt|tlc: Good morning Roland |pg||
nt|tlc: and Peter|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|tlc: or should I say - Afternoon--  morning here in California still|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2@h is a good weak two -- they use multi for bad weak twos|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|tlc: a weak 2 in @h is just what Fleisher of course wanted to hear with his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|tlc: so the inevitable 3NT is reached..|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: same bidding - same lead in CR|pg||
nt|tlc: the foul club break makes it appear that he will be a trick short|pg||
nt|pelu: yes - for sure I cant find the 9. trick :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|tlc: even with @D 3-3 there isnt time to develop a 9th trick before the heart shift comes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|tlc: unless NS set up a spade trick for fleisher..which seems unlikely|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: or S could be endplayed to lead @c|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tlc: only a defensive error is going to allow this to make..which seems unlikely|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein verifies that everything is natural.  inaudible whispers on other side of the screen|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfd: katz blinking and studying dumy|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: looks like a misunderstanding about the second double|pg||
nt|athene: west just intending it as "extras" and east as a lot more penalty-oriented|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise surely east would be bidding 3@C with that hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein had his hand folded, had to fish out @CJ, mumbles sorry|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: well the defence can pull three rounds of trumps now i guess|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfd: levin leans over the table deciding whether to overtake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 2 vugraph matches are NOT playing same boards, but you can still [try to] watch all tables via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sits straight and sighs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nickell asks if they're playing the same boards at other tables|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin detaches d9|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@S was forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: why 3@s forcing Joe?|pg||
nt|tlc: with 3-3 @D and the J@c onside,this should make an easy 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: cause they said so :)|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tlc: the 11th trick will probably not materialize as it risks going down now tho|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|tlc: wrong again :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|debrose: If their system defines 3@S as forcing, which does surprise me, Kamil doesn't really have any choice|pg||
nt|pelu: no u were right - the operator juyst show how to take 11 tricks|pg||
nt|tlc: ahhh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he bid 3 forcing spades because he "knew I had the right hand" (with 4 little hearts)|pg||
nt|debrose: Although he probably didn't mind much, knowing partner was short in hearts with 6+ spades - in fact might have even bid 4@S if 3@S weren't forcing|pg||
nt|tlc: for a bal 12 count,,Qxx of his partner's 6 card suit and no wastage in hearts isnt a bad hand|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4S7HAK9752DQT7C952,SAKJT42HD9632CQ43,S953HQJTDJ85CAJ86,SQ86H8643DAK4CKT7|sv|n|mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|athene: if south doubles, north might get excited|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: and bid some number of spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: opening and closing his hand is Bas|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: He is now doing the thinking man pose|pg||
nt|athene: if you bid 5@S now is that only asking for a heart control|pg||
nt|athene: or is it just a general invitation?|pg||
nt|athene: partner could have a pretty respectable double and you could still be off a spade trick and the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: not easy|pg||
nt|athene: this is why i think it's good to open 4 of a major more often than most people do|pg||
nt|athene: you give the opponents a lot of headaches|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|athene: now south has a heart control AND good spades|pg||
nt|athene: so it will be hard to turn this one down|pg||
nt|athene: since those are the two things that 5@S usually asks for|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand south hasn't got anything else |pg||
nt|athene: so he might just pass anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Brink now thinking with hands on chin|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: @CA lead very bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well the defence are ok as long as hamman doesn't try to cash his other ace|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: but no reason to do that|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|athene: if north has a club in his hand, this contract is never making|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|athene: ok that was cute|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: fell behind when connection dropped and katz playing very fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he does that :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: 4@S played from East in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: established the long diamond, lost CQ to CA and did not hook coming back|pg||

pc|h9|nt|pelu: against 3NT in CR West - Katz - missed the defense: @H10 to J, then 3x@D and East played @C???|pg||
nt|pelu: sprry West @C|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|debrose: While it is often right to pass 1N with 8 HCP, I think most would bid with Zia's hand.  With a four card major, and not 4-3-3-3, I recommend trying for game unless very poorly ...|pg||
nt|debrose: place values|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c3|nt|debrose: With QTxx of diamonds instead of @HQ would be much clearer|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that East on the @D discarded 2 x@H - so all the blame on East - not West :)|pg||
nt|tlc: I assume the lead of the 9@H shows 0 or 2 higher cards...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|debrose: No, the lead of the @H9 is Rusinow, promising the Ten|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|debrose: I've played often against this pair, and know that is what they play|pg||
nt|tlc: ok...so it just promises the ten or shortness|pg||
pc|d6|nt|debrose: This has been a very common expert approach against NT.  Many play Rusinow only with 4+ cards in the suit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|debrose: Ace from A-K, with King for count of unblock.  So must lead Q from KQ regardless of how many cards in suit (unless want unblock)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s2|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s3|pc|c4|nt|debrose: This has become a common approach, I meant|pg||
nt|tlc: it's also true that coded 10s and 9s are unpopular with many experts because it helps declarer at trick 1 more then the defenders|pg||
mc|8|pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SAQ63HQ75DT743C82,SK97HA62DQJ5C7654,S82HJ4DAK862CAKQ9,SJT54HKT983D9CJT3|sv|e|nt|athene: the "textbook" example of that particular swindle is when you give false count on partner's AK lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi william warren gm|pg||
nt|athene: unblocking a king is a bit more spectacular|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks John|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: zia might be disappointed to find that swindle was unnecessary of course|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: alert 1 s and alert 2h|pg||
nt|athene: it was still good though|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: and psychologically it will be worth a lot|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: it will likely still hit the Bullettin:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: i really doubt this hand was passed out in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: we saw 4@H until trick 3|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: that would be a very cautious view from east|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H likely down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry trying to reconstruct the play now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Hamman asking questions to Bas|pg||

nt|athene: you might be able to build a spade trick for a club pitch|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see how you can do everything you need to do|pg||
nt|athene: too much work for a 4-4 trump fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: unlikely S plays @S now which could help declarer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even down 2 (thought that was impossible here)?|pg||
nt|athene: of course one advantage of reaching a doomed game these days is you know at least they will be going down in it in the other room too :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: small consolation though:)|pg||
nt|athene: brink thinking whether he needs to attack clubs before declarer sets up a spade, or whether he needs to play a trump to stop ruffs, or what|pg||
nt|athene: thin game contracts on 4-4 trump fits are hard to defend because there are many possible lines of defence which could be right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and he is still thinking:)???|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|debrose: I think they play 15-17, unless they've recently changed, but with good controls and that chunky diamond holding, Kamil evaluated as more|pg||

nt|pelu: for sure invite for 3NT|pg||

nt|jaapfr: would you bid 3nt with all these Aces as N or @S?|pg||
nt|athene: well as north i would want to play 3n, with the trick source|pg||
nt|athene: but as south i would want to play in spades because i don't think partner will have tricks without the spades|pg||

nt|athene: he can plod away at a long-term strategy like cutting your communications with dummy for instance|pg||

nt|athene: not a coded lead|pg||
nt|athene: so hamman doesn't know the spades are so nice|pg||
nt|gavin:  his first decision is whether to duck or win the spade|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: with the club finesse into south you would win, if that were the only consideration|pg||
nt|athene: but the missing @HA makes it a bit harder|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  if he thinks his right hand opponent will regain the lead, then he cannot afford to win the ace of spades|pg||
nt|gavin:  as he expects the queen of spades to be with south|pg||
nt|gavin:  when north gets in (and south holds the queen) they could play a spade through his jack|pg||
nt|gavin:  by ducking the spade, he takes away that chance|pg||

nt|debrose: Fleisher falsecarded on the first trick because he didn't want declarer to know he had both club honors|pg||

nt|debrose: This type of falsecard is dangerous, and can cause partner to misdefend, so should be used judiciously.  Fleisher was perhaps hoping for declarer to go up with the @SK with Kx, and ...|pg||
nt|debrose: didn't think declarer would play him for AK, A as a passed hand|pg||

nt|debrose: And now we see the falsecard coming back to haunt Fleisher.  Also might be something of an ethical problem, becuase of time taken at trick one|pg||
nt|debrose: True, some players would always take time to plan defense before winning club Ace, and I think Fleisher may be one who tries to do that, but not sure how consistently|pg||
nt|tlc: I agree..I dont think taking time at trick 1 to plan the defense would necessarily cause an ethical problem..|pg||

nt|athene: assuming you get the diamonds right you can just cash out for 9|pg||
nt|gavin:  the @S8 could be from Q8 , he is not sure that the aq are onside|pg||
nt|gavin:  or a8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: might take the ""wrong"" @D finesse to protect @SK|pg||
nt|athene: playing on the majors might see east win the @HA and west win a lot of spades|pg||
nt|athene: sure it's not likely that west has all the spades|pg||
nt|athene: but in "normal" circumstances playing imps you just don't take these chances|pg||
nt|gavin:  his first order of business|pg||
nt|gavin:  is to figure out who is likely to be longer in diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|gavin:  I think he is taking his time to see if theres some information available to him that can help|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: "safety" finessing diamonds to keep east off lead to protect the @SKx isn't safe, though, is it?|pg||
nt|gavin:  and perhaps he felt like losing to west queen of diamonds was better than east|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: well he has gone for that anyway|pg||
nt|jaapfr: luckily @HA not wrong place but for declarer this hand a nightmere|pg||

mb|3D|an|5-5 game force|nt|Vugraphzfc: that's big for them (with transfer responses over 1@C)|pg||
nt|debrose: Judgement as to when to sacrafice is very tough, and does swing a lot of imps.  If the cards were a little different, 4@S might be going down.  Down two sacrifices only gain 3 or 4 ...|pg||
nt|debrose: IMPs when their game is making, and lose 8 or 12 (depending on vul) when they weren't making|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they just accept the transfer with a min bal hand|pg||
nt|debrose: @H transfer rersponses showed spades.  1N now shows balanced 18-19|pg||
nt|pelu: we can see that 4@S is easy game - but some would bid 3Nt here - the short @S-stopper indicat that 4@S best game|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry short @H-stopper|pg||
nt|tlc: so with all minimum hands,, he has to rebid 1@S?|pg||
nt|debrose: Many who play this system play 14-16 NT openings, so 1N starts at 17, but I believe this pair plays 15-17.  Fleisher's hand is worth at least 18, and he chooses to treat it as ...|pg||
nt|debrose: balanced|pg||
nt|debrose: The 1@H response is just like a standard 1@S response - 4+ spades, any strength|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes, with min bal hand and 2 or 3 spades (or 4 spades in a terrible hand), accept the transfer -- with 4 spades normally bid 2@S|pg||
nt|tlc: thanks joe|pg||

nt|debrose: this system, I'll be glad to pass it on|pg||

nt|pelu: a contructiv bid from West could be 3@h|pg||
nt|tlc: marty will be worried with Ax of hearts about whether to head for 3NT or play in a pointed suit...slam oppsitave a passed hand will be tought o gauge|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia is wondering around the room -- Brink tells him to come back and play  -- some laughter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 of 9 boards pushed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: at trick 2, nickell asked weinstein if it was a smith situation and whether H3 was count or attitude.  weinstein said: "if you let us tell we'll never screw it up"|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Kamil did NOT open East hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: then when levin played S5, katz jokingly asked if that was count or suit preference|pg||
mb|2D|an|GF|nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein looking down with the bill of his cap pulled over his forehead - as usual|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: NS might get themselves doubled if they bid too many hearts here|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps hard for EW to double without trump tricks|pg||
nt|gavin:  Its very important with souths hand to pass here|pg||
nt|gavin:  since you only have 4 points, either west or north has a strong hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  if you freely bid 3@H here, even when you are correct, your partner will take you too seriously|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room again in 5@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin wearing light jacket from his jaunt outside|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia thinking|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: he listened and passes:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: he wants to hear 3@H so he can bid 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: brutal bid from Bobby|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfd: levin: "I'm sorry, this could be a huge one, but--"|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Bob says some good some not so good|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: may be disappointed that Bob couldn't bid three again|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ányway 4@C spot on|pg||
nt|gavin:  with good diamonds drijver decided to lead passively , not fearing the major suit losers dissappearing|pg||
nt|athene: do you have to ruff the @SQ down for a heart pitch?|pg||
nt|athene: or is there something better?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, spot on with this lead - not so spot on if North had chanced to lead a heart|pg||
nt|gavin:  drijver expects dummy to hit with weakness in both majors|pg||
nt|gavin:  since east could have bid 3@H or 3@S in an effort to reach 3NT|pg||
nt|gavin:  he was unaware which major was zia's problem for 3NT|pg||
nt|gavin:  so he elects not to gamble |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: like everyone else -- I wonder what else Nick needed to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nickell pulled SA first but put it back - don't know what their agreements are here|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|dburn: oh, sure - I didn't expect him to lead a heart, or anything but a club|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: Joe did announce 2@D was Game Force|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: here weinstein confirmed it with nickell at the end of the auction|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|athene: if it was spades, though, that would give south @SAK, so maybe hearts is the % weak spot|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|athene: if you assume EW do have one major totally wide open|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree leading a heart can just give the contract so many times, a trump looked normal|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d on the 4-3 fit was good enough for 4 IMPs to Nickell|pg||
nt|athene: are there any sort of extra board things if the match is very close?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down in @H??|pg||
nt|dburn: when Wold and Bates tried 3NT, down, rather than 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: or is 1 imp a win?|pg||
nt|dburn: one is enough|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, 0.1 is enough if the Director imposes some adjustment or other|pg||
nt|athene: zia going for the psychological line|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told 7 extra boards if a tie|pg||
nt|dburn: he's not doing anything psychological particularly - maybe he can endplay North|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if N sees pd with @HK (no 3nt bis W) he plays x@H for @D switch i think|pg||
nt|dburn: "psychological" would be a low spade to the jack|pg||
nt|athene: well he did have the option of ruffing a spade to drop the queen|pg||
nt|dburn: he still does|pg||
nt|athene: and then throwing a heart from dummy on his @S10|pg||
nt|athene: yes but now he has let the defence cash two hearts|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a spec says S had to play @HK direct based on the same reasoning ( W not 3nt)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lots of thinking sigh by Bas|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he keeps playing with card|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: katz trying to muddle the position|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d2|nt|jaapfr: so i think that is the worry of N|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if my pd had @HK why he did not play it direct|pg||
nt|athene: i still think there was an element of psychology in the way zia played this|pg||
nt|athene: he was just relying on the fact that south would not take his honour|pg||
nt|athene: and he was known to have the king probably from the opening lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okay lost the play they did it so fast now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin:  4@C making or not will be a loss for the Nickell team|pg||

nt|dburn: will Meckwell bid 3NT? is the Pope a Catholic?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: may be yes:)|pg||
nt|gavin:  however they must play a diamond through before taking the heart ruff, as declarer would use the 13th heart to pitch a diamond|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gavin:  compressing the diamond loser with one of the trump losers|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: as reply to yr 2nd question:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: meckwell will open south 1@D not 1@C of course, which makes the penalty pass fractionally less appealing, maybe?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: since north has more length in the bid suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia asking discards|pg||
nt|gavin:  south's club was suit preference for diamonds i imagine|pg||
nt|gavin:  since south knew that north was leading from shortness|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|gavin:  and north knew that south knew because declarer ducked (therefore south has the queen)|pg||

mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|gavin:  this looks to be a pretty good spot, typically 4-3 fits are worse when the opponents can force you to ruff with your 4 card suit|pg||
nt|athene: NS should know this is a 4-3 fit because with four spades zia would have bid them first time|pg||
nt|gavin:  here it doesnt cause much concern with trumps breaking|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: getting forced in the long trump holding is only bad if you really fear losing trump control|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i still believe that with the last 4 tricks left W played @S and N returned @S (easier to believe 1 player did something wrong then that 3 players were wrong about the claim)|pg||
nt|athene: and that is only bad if you have some big side suit you need to cash|pg||
nt|jaapfr: b59|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: zia says solid and then thank you and lead in partners suit is ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they all agreed to claim|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: or will he bid an honest notrump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Good point Al, which reminds me of board 11, where the jump to 5@C pushed opps into bidding at 5 level|pg||
nt|debrose: while in this room jumping only to 4@C ended with buying the hand in 5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: katz writes levin a note in tiny letters then quickly scratches it out|pg||
pc|dK|nt|debrose: certainly some randomness there, but I've observed that bidding more to "make the opponents guess" does fairly often have this effect|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: ok, he doesn't have to decide|pg||

nt|athene: and west finessed against dummy|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C much safer spot but @H layout means Weinstein choice of 1N is safe|pg||
nt|debrose: However, on board 14, I believe Hamman's 3@S overcall might have been systemicly showing that sort of hand, rather than a wildly strong preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS published range is   good 14-17|pg||
nt|debrose: 3@C was an interesting spot - not exactly safe, since could lose two diamonds, and a trick in each of the other suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: other tables in this room have finished - we still have one board to go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm with you Debbie   i think 14 was result of very tiny differences yielding significant differences|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|dburn: that gave Meckstroth a tempo, and his eighth trick before the defenders could get six|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  NOBODY can stop in 2@C :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not likely to lose 7 imps here|pg||
nt|athene: it wouldn't matter anyway with a spade going away|pg||
nt|dburn: I think 14 was the result of Fleisher bidding 2@h then 5@h - the sort of thing that produces a swing, but not always in your column|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: oops sorry, typoed D2 for S2|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: they use 2@D here for majors so 2@C can be natural since EW open all balanced min with 1@c (even with 5-3-3-2 with 5 diamonds)|pg||
nt|debrose: And if declarer had a stiff diamond, trump shift might be effective|pg||
nt|imp_jan: tempting for zia to go all the way to 4M|pg||
nt|tlc: those who wondered why 2C wasnt majors:  many experts these days are playing that over a "could be short" 1@c, that 2@c is natural and 2@D takes the place of Michales|pg||
mb|2H|nt|debrose: Fleisher played his middle diamond there - I believe that is defined as standard attitude for them, and he didn't want to play low because he had nothing in spades, the suit ...|pg||
nt|debrose: partner would be likely to shift to|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2@H some raise i suppose|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@C by zia, cue bidding galore|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: likely limit + with clubs|pg||
nt|debrose: agree, Joe|pg||
nt|tlc: popular treatment is: 2@h=limit+@C and 2@s=game forcing in @ds|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or reversed|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3N|nt|imp_jan: wow, zia underbidding, that's rare|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: I think invitation + in @D is the more standard "unusual vs. unusual" treatment, but perhaps some do play as tlc describes|pg||
nt|tlc: or as deb sez, inv+ as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: what does the dbl mean? no heart lead? :)|pg||
nt|tlc: altho zia has points.. he actually has a 1-count in the majors--the 2 suits his partner has shown|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|tlc: and at fav vul, the michaels bid might not be that great|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Kamil:  "I lose at 'chicken,' as usual"|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|debrose: The double meant he thought they were going down........  or else he thought they were making it wanted them to run:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|debrose: I doubt it meant no heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Zia claims 3 more tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last board of the set|pg||
mb|1C|nt|debrose: Anyway, I see 3@C was indeed safer, since down 2 sure wasn't happening:)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: usually about 15 minute break until next set  --   but teams can agree to start sooner|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein: majors. we're copying you|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|dburn: well, you might want to watch the last board in this one first|pg||
nt|gavin:  we had a nice discussion on our site which lead to the following article about how involved vugraph commentators should be in the accuracy of results. http://bridgewinners.com/jason-feldman/321-instant-replay  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: knowing both suits -- 2@H & 2@S both available as cue bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so players use similar treatment as Unusual vs Unusual|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin reaches for a bid, pulls back...|pg||
mb|2N!|an|NAT INV|nt|gavin:  operators rather|pg||
nt|jaapfr: forgot b64|pg||
nt|debrose: Standard "unusual vs. unusual" is 2@H limit + in clubs and 2@S inv + in diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: whispers inaudible explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: then weinstein inquires about the pass|pg||
nt|debrose: other treatments for those Q-bids are also possible|pg||
mb|3C|an|min, if !S=!H, then short !C|nt|Vugraphzfd: will forward any details I am able to glean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: before UvU  people would play 2M=stopper|pg||
nt|debrose: such as stopper showing, but I think very few if any experts play that way these days|pg||
mb|3D|nt|debrose: In theory the players behind screens are required to write their explanations - ideally largely and clearly for the vugraph operators benefit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hilarious  2N alerted because Natural|pg||
nt|debrose: In practice, the inaudible whispering is all too common|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|debrose: It looks funny Al, but the reality is behind screens players tend to explain all their bids that might not be totally obvious to their screenmates|pg||
nt|debrose: There is no clear distinction between alertable and not alertable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh i know -- but there is no humor value there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|debrose: So the operator may be alerting us here, and entering an explanation, as is very helpful, because one was given|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was about to follow-up with     i played convention card where we said 2N is NEVER Natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein: what did you show? nickell: clubs and diamonds, invitational values|pg||
nt|jbennet: on an artificial 2 NT in compettive situations many pair use D as "im interested to compete" whereas pass should indicates "not interested to bid above their level" or "i know what ...|pg||
nt|jbennet: to do"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: just looking at the diamond suit here you should cash the king first as you can pick up 4-0 with west but not east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin: hmm! at sight of dummy|pg||
nt|debrose: sorry to spoil your joke Al:(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: players all seem ready for a breather|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: nick cranes his head to check the score|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: but entries are (as usual) a bit of a problem for considerations of that nature|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|imp_jan: NEXT :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Katz has done some magical things as declarer -- but this won't be an example|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: hard to see a swing on this board|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jaapfr: unlikely b64 generates anything else but a push (agree?)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: praying for 2-2 @C split|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he may not have as much info as weinstein gave nickell|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: so tx all bye|pg||
nt|jbennet: so west passed 2 NT and that should have warned east from bid again. (he could have waited for opponents to stop in 3 major and then D to show a possible 4 of a minor contract. )|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough situation having to decide how to bid East hand  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe he should delay 2nd bid after the artificial 3@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin sighs. weinstein sighs.  katz looking for a miracle|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|c5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin reluctantly played S8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: katz has a card detached for several seconds, replaces it, counts his tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: weird - if Katz plays a low heart now, he may be out for down only one|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|dburn: good shot|pg||
nt|murat e: çok fazla bilgi alýþveriþi oldu|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|c7|nt|dburn: since he can strip South's majors and play a diamond|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: well done to find 8 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: overran by 4 minutes.  2nd quarter soonish.  closing down for now|pg||
