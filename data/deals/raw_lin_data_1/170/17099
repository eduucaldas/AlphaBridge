nt|chorush: What about the contract being 2 diamonds in the other room?|pg||

nt|brolucius: I heard about a great defense from Zia this morning. His partner, who had opened 4H led the @HA against a slam. Dummy went down with a singleton and Zia false-carded the @HK from ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: @HK-x. Declarer ruffed the next round high from A-K-Q-x and Zia's J-x-x in trumps was promoted. Brilliant!|pg||
nt|sybarra: not showing my age, just showing my knowledge of old movies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cayne match also exchanged about 100 imps last set for a negligible change in the match|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|yuval10: already some excitement, 6@d was made in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some commotion as other tables restart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss still studying.  deck may seem to have too many points in it|pg||

mb|1H!|an|8-11|nt|yuval10: 5NT is interesting, of course in standart bridge it means to pick between 6 or 7, but it doesn't seem likely considering West' strength|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess North might bid 4NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: West leaps to 4@S rather than tip his hand with a cue-bid response. Interesting. He makes life more difficult for N/S that way.|pg||
nt|dburn: intending to convert clubs to diamonds to show 6-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=656&Itemid=284|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: with 5-5, he would bid diamonds at once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-8 HCP  or  9+ with no more than 1 King|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann exhales deeply. looks tired|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS play a version of Precision   EW 2/1 with lots of special agreements|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ HCP  unbal  17+ bal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rhelle: 1NT by North is normally 12.5 - 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: green cards placed delicately on the tray|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar sees them when the tray comes back, puts his cards down and his hands to his temples|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: nice easy board to start the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar leans back, crosses his legs, still thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is great to see the top stars bid these competitive deals - a very difficult area for most of us.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue's strength limited by failure to open Precision @C|pg||
nt|ritong: and leading a @c from Jx is highly unlikely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visibe using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|5S|nt|vugraphzfe: fingering @DA and @DQ|pg||
nt|ritong: +|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, diamonds may play better than hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: this probably isn't the real auction|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have no idea what is going on - looks like a transcription error|pg||
nt|sybarra: good flop as Henri says?|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with a potential trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads/carding  3rd/5th vs suit  4th vs NT    upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure both matches playing the same boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = any 8-11, FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "sorry if this was wrong"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'll give link for EW as soon as they're identified :)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|yuval10: 6@d actually a lot better than 6NT, you can make it even when the K@h is off ( playing small @s from hand towards the Q, then if south doesn't jump you discard the K@s over the 4th ...|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c and if he does you can discard 2 @h's )|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|dburn: but both contracts have issues of trump control|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 5@S showed specifically @S & @C|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb 4@s4m?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well actually it does NOT include 8+ HCP, 5+@S  [1@S]   all other positive responses to 1@C show 12+ HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Score not correct,  real score is 41-25|pg||

nt|hedyg: doesnt|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has three top tricks - the club ruff is for down two|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess that after the ruff, Grue can pick up the hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he can handle it all|pg||
nt|ritong: he can|pg||
nt|ritong: fred has two @cs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Jacki: welcome Ira chorush|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade switch is clear, but West can give a suit preference card anyway.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|yuval10: here you have to rely on the @h finesse, but it worked so 2 imps for diamond |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss that 5N was pick a slam,  Gitelman thought it was choose 6 or 7|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Joanna, thanks |pg||
pc|s2|nt|chorush: This is an agressive 6 spade contract which might make on a good day, which this is not|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman: "I have to admit it occurred to me you were psyching there"|pg||
nt|hedyg: picked up the Q@H?|pg||
nt|dburn: but judging by that, he did well|pg||
nt|brolucius: A splendid opening board for us.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry i just walked in and I'm afraid I missed the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: we lost our connection|pg||
nt|ritong: and we start with slammy hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the match ends with board 64 [unless tie]  winners play in Semi-Finals tomorrow   losers  maybe watch vugraph|pg||
nt|ritong: previous set was WoW about these|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome a well rested Henri|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chorush: hi Wayne|pg||
nt|ritong: interesting hand, regarding style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2010 Trials Convention cards online for both teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: NS in the OR judged very well to bid to the 5 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N=good 14 to 17|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer to @D and 3 nt?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think they play   3@C=@D  [weak or FG]|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think brad will content himself with that, shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well Shirley's sequence should be mild slam try  otherwise just 1N-3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: matter of agreements re the transfer sequence|pg||
nt|ritong: there are other considerations|pg||
nt|sybarra: or another sequence maybe be game force stayman...and..|pg||
nt|ritong: one is moss' hand is really good and justifies more than a mild try|pg||
nt|ritong: an other is, when you transfer for @ds and bid 3NT afterwards, there must be a reason  for us, it shows @c shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room has already crashed once -- are we in holding pattern because of connection or is Brad in the tank?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=656&Itemid=284|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: don't worry - the play is not likely to be too fast for you to keep up with from now on|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is on page 240 of the system notes right? |pg||
nt|ritong: not really|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 142|pg||
nt|ritong: will levin repeat @ds or raise @hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=659&Itemid=284|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: We are all indebted to BBO for letting us watch these top tournaments free of charge. I hope they don't change their mind one day...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yuval10: EW put maximum pressure over South|pg||
nt|hedyg: shhhhhhh! dont give them ideas!|pg||
nt|wstuart: Have Chips and Lew changed to a str NT vul?|pg||
nt|wstuart: *Chip|pg||
nt|chorush: yes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: always thinking  about chips?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: but it seem as if he has a 5@h now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyone believe that was a typo??|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@c= 2+|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will still be free for commentators, Hedy. No need to worry.|pg||
nt|chorush: that dbl has just transformed this hand from something resembling a push to a swing for Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: chip wrote 12-14|pg||
nt|wstuart: He wrote 12-14 on the notepad the operator says.  This is very un-Chip-like.  He's a very aggressive player and I wouldn't expect him to downgrade a controlish 15 HCP, even though ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: it is 4333.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: well at least im here now for the auction|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally so:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c looks like a decent contract - not easy to bid though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  4@H Ace Ask   taking control|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: a short fight, finally|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss grimaces a bit, points at dummy, still making plans|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i should say Key Card Ask      5@C=2 without Q|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: shorter than next room, where EW pushed a bit|pg||
nt|chorush: It may only be 3rd 4th position vul|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|yuval10: South must've been convinced that his Partner has void @s|pg||
nt|wstuart: At one time they played 12-14 in all seats *except* 3rd, where it was 15-17.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if non-imp scoring would change Levin's choice of rebid|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yuval10: on surface it looks like N's double meant to discourage his Partner of carry on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although if the kibitzers had to pay they would probably be less tolerant of the mistakes that the commentators make.|pg||
nt|dburn: optimistic, that - should South really have both majors stopped and the ace of clubs?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 1st leader change of the set  --  how many more will we see?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this lead may let him escape for down only one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the result is an impossible 3NT in the wrong hand|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzfe: some question whether the 84-44 carryover is correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol no Liz|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is E/W bidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't make it with these cards, but maybe has more chance on the actual borad 3|pg||
nt|dburn: no, this is North-South bidding - they're just not bidding board 2 again|pg||
nt|harmon: theyve crossed rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: we got disconnected sorry|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss:"just to show off"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 1st of 4 16-board quarters for the Semi-Finals of the Vanderbilt Cup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: short break between sets 1&2  3&4   long break at the half|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually raise on 3 is more appealling with WEAKER trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with strong trump ruffing risk is that declarer might have very weak holding to cover opponent's trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember -- modern game bids 1M with suit of 5432|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in old days the response of 1Major required some suit quality  but  now we be with xxxx  [5432]|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|chorush: yes, and a fat 13 imps to Nickell|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ritong: levin should hold this to down one|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: underbid|pg||
nt|ritong: i won t have time to develop about the transfer sequel|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to be critical, but perhaps it was "lazy" bidding at other table|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|nt|wstuart: No real problems discarding with Katz's hand.  Martel is hoping for a miracle, but it doesn't appear to be a religious holiday for him.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told there was webcam yesterday -- if anyone knows about coverage for today -- please send the URL and i'll announce to the room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greco shakes his head (behind screen) when @C ruffed|pg||
nt|ritong: 9 and 10 of @d indicate doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Levin asks about Q lead|pg||
nt|ritong: hampson would play jack from J109|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: promises J or shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: and low at some point from 109x|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: A@S?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if one of the majors was bare, West might have made an unlucky choice of lead. It was adventurous bidding by N/S that could have worked better.|pg||
nt|dburn: true, and I guess if South had a couple of aces, the unstopped major might well be 4-4 anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
nt|dburn: downgrade previous comment to "mildly optimisitic"|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: was worth 4NT imho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs use Rusinow Leads  [2nd of touching honors]  but only versus NT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: agree Henri |pg||
nt|sybarra: something more that 3 nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Bertens-Bakkeren 1N opener can be half point less at the top -- but still|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe even 3 @H cue?|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the fact that opener denied interest with 3@d enters the pic|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: bertens decided slam was at best on a finesse, likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when transfer is any strength, rebid of 3@H/@S usually shows shortness|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|nt|hedyg: so he did play the A@S|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||

nt|ferlema: ok|pg||
nt|wstuart: I would not have opened 1@H, either, unless in the context of a strong @C system.|pg||
nt|passell: 15 and a good 6 card suit seems too much to make a light invitation|pg||
nt|ritong: hi mike welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Every conventional use of a bid has some downside. Stayman, probably the most uniformly played convention of all time, had a big downside on this hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yes we agreed on that point|pg||
nt|passell: hi   this is quite a match|pg||
nt|ritong: sure enough!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited by failure to open 1@C  -- and could be 5@H & 5@S|pg||
nt|passell: congrats to the Berg teams great performance througout this event|pg||
nt|passell: they were way to tough for me yesterday|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set was exactly 100 imps exchanged for net difference of about 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: we just threw the imps in the air|pg||
mb|1N!|an|15-17|nt|sybarra: and they landed....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: So, I tihnk their NT in 3rd seat white is 12-14 (15-17 vul 4rd only).|pg||
nt|ritong: might need an other coffee:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bertens overcalled 1N rather than Moss' DBL   looks close to me|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wstuart: I'm sure Stansby will upgrade this hand to a 15-17 NT evaluation.|pg||
nt|chorush: you are probably correct Wayne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: historically   that is really 14+ to 17|pg||
nt|ritong: @s 7 comes from three small, when north would not lead from KJ7 here|pg||
nt|ritong: so greco will duck twice|pg||
nt|ritong: keeping his precious 10|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzfe: kibitzer sits behind brad.  our first as opposed to the mob hovering at the zia-hamman table|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@s = @h, 9+, unbalanced|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman, after sitting still for a minute, grabs the pass card off his tray|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@c = 4+@c|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ritong: he had no real reason to get involved here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok -- i'm sure i would have bid 1N at the table|pg||
nt|ritong: and other potential swing|pg||
nt|passell: sorry i had to miss the last quarter|pg||
nt|ritong: gee|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: a strong @c?|pg||
nt|dburn: by the look of things|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@d = relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if DBL by Fred would absolutely deny 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on previous board   Diamond-Platnick play a Big Club [very similar to Greco-Hampson version of RM Lite]|pg||
pc|h4|nt|passell: this may actually make |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he can't really risk hearing @D from partner|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|rhelle: 2@s = at least 55 in @h and @c|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT = relay|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you proceed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so they had toy for East to show ALL of   Good Hand [for non-1@C], 6@D, 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond in 3@H West|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rhelle: 3@s = eaxctly 3=5=0=3|pg||
nt|passell: will take careful defense|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|007 joosth: a hard job to do|pg||
nt|wstuart: Let me type tihs more accurately**So, I think their NT in 3rd seat white is 12-14 (15-17 vul 3rd only).|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@D was GF checkback, I assume.|pg||
nt|chorush: Specs are asking why Stansby would upgrade his hand. the reason is the good 5 card suit mostly|pg||
nt|wstuart: The very fine controls are another reason.|pg||
nt|wstuart: I more true method than the A=4, K=3, Q=2, etc evaluation is to count Aces as 4.5, kings as 3 and Q and J as a little less than the Goren HCP representatoin.|pg||
nt|chorush: There is no obvious eighth trick here much less a ninth, so Meckwell did well to make 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: claim -- let opponents figure it out|pg||
nt|ritong: the @c stack is hidden|pg||
nt|ritong: and south did not lead his singleton|pg||
nt|passell: yes club lead down for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: however, north might switch to a @c in order to open trick(s) before @ds are good|pg||
nt|passell: looks like a trick short|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: lacks a tempo|pg||
nt|sybarra: but a tap in the long trump hand  kills it doesnt it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 53  Nickell 13-0 for the set  now leads Fleisher by 20|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some would say  the only true "precious" card is The Beer Card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone have the URL that explains details/history of Beer Card?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rhelle: 3NT is to play|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|yuval10: time to stop now|pg||

nt|brolucius: That lead would have paid off if East held a singleton club.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 17 opposite 16+ ... he won't stop under slam|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c = 4 controls, 15+|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW convention card from 2010 Trials   http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblcards/GrecoHampson.jpg|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wstuart: Aces and Kings gain power the more distributional the contract hands are, and aces and Kings combined with a 5 card suit for NT is a very big plus.|pg||
nt|rhelle: At first glance this looks as 1 of 2 finesses. 5@c tricks, 2@d, 1@h, 2@s = 10. An extra trick can be developed in @h or @s|pg||
nt|rhelle: so finding trick 12 is what it's all about - before giving away 2|pg||

pc|d4|nt|vugraphzfe: had @H2 out but put it back|pg||
nt|passell: unreal|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is type of hand that shows weakness of double dummy software -- much more interesting when defense can't see the cards|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wstuart: Specs ask if a 1NT rebid could conceal 1 or 2 4 card majors the way Martel-Stansby are playing, and I believe the answer is yes, they tend to rebid 1NT to show the Strong NT when ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: possible.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rhelle: this trick will not be what South was waiting for|pg||
nt|rhelle: Chances are that the @sQ is with West now - he can see 6@h and 2@c in East already|pg||
nt|harmon: needs more than that|pg||
nt|rhelle: So he needs a double squeeze - @s@d against West, @h@d against East. But he has no @d entry ...|pg||
nt|rhelle: Not enough entries to ruff the @ds high either|pg||
nt|rhelle: Looks like he'll need the double @s finesse against West|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||

pc|s2|pc|d5|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: good read/discards from Steve Weinstein to minimize damage|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann makes a fist to show that 2@H is strong.  gitelman gently passes|pg||

mb|p|nt|wstuart: if Lew finesses he can make, but I doubt he will do that.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Maybe however.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Interesting choice here at T1|pg||
nt|wstuart: Nvm|pg||
nt|chorush: he is going to make 11 tricks whether he finesses or not, in my opinion|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: question of whether this goes down quickly or slowly, I guess|pg||

mb|3S|an|6!S-4!H|nt|ritong: 2NT artif prolly any gf hand with no suitable rebid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar: not the worst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: then asks who wants water; moss accepts|pg||
nt|rhelle: NS play reverse count and attitude - so the 4 is from an even number|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  just some tool for Weinstein to complete shape|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: a club lead would mean quickly, this means slowly - assuming the defense does nothing silly|pg||
nt|wstuart: Doesn't 3 rds of @C beat it too, Ira?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: so far eldad has shown a strong 2 in @hs with questionable suit quality|pg||
nt|yuval10: double-dummy 6@h looks quite fair, but not today|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT is a kind of puppet, asking opener to come back to his opening suit|pg||

nt|ritong: it seems that a top @c lead would be bad|pg||

pc|cK|nt|Jacki: did you use our payment screens?  b/c your deposit didn't go through.  The error message usually means a wrong card type (it's a drop down menu) or a wrong CVV number|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Diamond stops in 2@S after  Platnick Semi-Force 1N|pg||
nt|ritong: weinstein has few options at that point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting that Diamond did NOT show @H|pg||
nt|drewsky: A trump lead probably would have defeated this contract for sure.|pg||
nt|ritong: ya drew|pg||
nt|ritong: hampson considered his lead for a long time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with @H strength trump sure seems like 1st or 2nd choice|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Levin pacing in empty room|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|ritong: they did not want to try the coup three in a row  remained possible, though|pg||
nt|ritong: in this context, 3@c instead of 2NT would be forcing|pg||

nt|ritong: moss cares about the excited part|pg||

nt|hedyg: he ruffed the queen? really?|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|drewsky: Most would say that these 2 teams are BOTH considered 2 of the top 3 or 4 teams in the United States, so they BOTH want to beat the other so badly that they will take a long time ...|pg||
nt|drewsky: to complete this match.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chorush: no diamond will be lost; delarer will pitch his two losing diamonds on the AK of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if memory serves  this is rematch of finals from 2010 Team Trials AND 2010 Spingold|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|bg: these club discards are risky if W swithches now it is not safe to set up hearts|pg||

nt|wstuart: ah, of course.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: speaking of good front runners   Nickell now 20-0 for the set  leads Fleisher by 27|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- how many don't know the term "rubber match"?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: In Rubber Bridge   [before 4-deal/Chicago]   2 games out of 3 won a Rubber|pg||
nt|ritong: surprising move by greco anyway|pg||
nt|drewsky: For many many years, the Nick Nickell team was always considered the 'chalk' in the national knockout events. Lately both the Diamond team and the Fleisher team have been added to ...|pg||
nt|drewsky: that 'chalk'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so if 1 win each   the 3rd match is the Rubber Match|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer is known 6430, not sure how @d A can be good|pg||
nt|drewsky: 10 imps to Fleisher here....|pg||

nt|ahollan1: one window per table|pg||
nt|ritong: two trump tricks with that J643 holding are really unlikely|pg||
nt|ritong: well next|pg||
mb|3N!|an|solid 7 card suit|nt|hedyg: Liz is going to have a tough time if they play and claim so quickly|pg||
nt|chorush: Very friendly diamond layout for this slam, presuming it is reached|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know their methods assuming there are methods for hands like these|pg||
nt|drewsky: Open 3@H or 4@H at these colors ? I would open 3@H, but I am conservative|pg||
mb|4C|nt|wstuart: True, though it doesn't really require a friendly layout to make.|pg||
nt|Jacki: Live streaming available here:   www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  If anyone knows the names of the players at the table, share with us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Kantar created the convention where 3N showed solid MAJOR|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: this one looks routine|pg||
nt|ritong: other room EW got offboard due to the systemic 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ritong: showing the equivalent of a very good weak 2 in @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: if you wonder how they treat very strong hands, big @c is the answer|pg||
nt|ritong: any 16+ hand is opened 1@c|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a school of thought that one shouldn't Michaels with a 6 card Maj, however, I don't know if much analysis has been done on 7-5 bidding.  :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  looks liek Robert Levin|pg||
nt|sybarra: open a browser for each room you want to see|pg||
nt|ritong: moss will probably bid 4@s directly|pg||
nt|ritong: to me it is a textbook 3@h at unfav  but i am VERY conservative reg preempts|pg||
nt|jaapfr: half of the scoreboard keeps reading as a beercard since you started to talk about the beercard @D7|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The East hand is worth an extra point, with those controls and the five-card spades.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the convention card that I am looking at, 2NT shows only 20-21. That's puzzling.|pg||
nt|dburn: Cheek may well lead a heart, which will work rather well for him|pg||
nt|hedyg: except the @s suit is not nice and stiff AK not great for NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he downgraded?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Top players rarely downgrade.|pg||
nt|ritong: after the raise, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Mind you, they don't miscount very often either.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have 20-21(22) may have a 5 card major|pg||
nt|wstuart: As you can see from the 3@S bid - Martel is a very aggressive player, which is why I was surprised when he downgraded a control righ 15 HCP to a 12-14 NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  and can't miss Meckstroth....|pg||
nt|robbg:  Weinstein (r) meck (l) with backs to us|pg||
nt|chorush: I would think Katz would close the bidding with 6 hearts here, unless he thinks he has a good way to get to 7 if it is there|pg||
nt|robbg:  Levin facing|pg||
nt|rhelle: systematically, NS have to open 1@h with 55 majors|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: a diamond wn't work so well|pg||
nt|algraves: hello everyone|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: 2@d is 18-19(20)|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, it may not work at all|pg||
nt|dburn: though declarer will still have to guess the play extremely well|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@S is a control bid in @S showing a good hand and making a slam try in @Hs.|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4NT is likely RKC|pg||
nt|wstuart: Katz will likely jump showing the number of keycards and a void.|pg||
nt|chorush: They will have a way to show a void but Katz cannot be sure the void is not opposite an ace, as it happens to be here|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jillan:  3 aces and a spade void|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy bid   |pg||
nt|ritong: experts hate leads from xxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW auction would have been interesting after 4@H opening|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yuval10: 9 easy tricks from top|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is visibly sitting on the benefits|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry, got knocked off the internet but didn't miss any of the bridge|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard promises 4 @s and opener|pg||
nt|ritong: i think they can raise on 3 now and then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H2 is ATTITUDE|pg||
pc|sK|nt|algraves: seems normal|pg||
nt|wstuart: (RKC = Roman Keycard Blackwood) where there are 5 controls -  the 4 aces and the trump K.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "that's too fast", takes time to study dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: just trying to avoid big swings|pg||
nt|ritong: if he was not doing that, he would certainly raise @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss wrote: if you bid 1NT, X would be takeout. haven't discussed here|pg||
nt|ritong: which were freely bid by his pard|pg||
nt|hedyg: so now he knows no @D in N|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|harmon: 4d could be beaten2 so this is better|pg||
nt|rhelle: it bites them here ... 4@h or 4@s looks solid|pg||
nt|harmon: they play canape??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i played those a lot in the 70s/80s  and to be honest  i have no idea how/why they work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh  soo sorry vs suit 3rd/5th|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: a @c now and...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: why @c rather than @H?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: oy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rhelle: no, just to keep the relays symmetrical - it's an exception|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bg: some may try to run club 8 now but not at imps risk of losing 4 dia tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he probably knew that anyway - he would not expect Cheek to lead from @dAQ108 only against 2NT - all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how so you say that in French Henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: oy²|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice H @H|pg||
nt|passell: great lead ace and a diamond for sure he would go down|pg||
nt|ritong: he s not home and dry, but indeed would have been tougher|pg||
nt|passell: may still make on a dbl squeeze  but great guessing involved|pg||
nt|passell: he will probably play to ruff in queen of diamonds  then guess the end position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other than  it works   was there any reason Muller could find @C shift|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t think moss can afford to check if @h was an underlead or not|pg||
nt|ritong: so many winning other solutions|pg||
nt|passell: club shift would be bad he would be forced to guess the dia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room the opening lead was @D    then @C10 shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: but is club shift, with 106xx |pg||
nt|sybarra: you just dont have a club spot in the S hand|pg||
nt|passell: maybe he will guess it anyway since a low dia wasnt shifted to  he might have without the queen|pg||
nt|passell: a truly great hand of cat and mouse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cool inference Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree MIke,  can be making, -1, making, +1 etc |pg||

nt|jillan:  Nick bid hearts first so he should be playing right|pg||
nt|wstuart: Right - Nickell was playing it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: east took a short break|pg||
nt|wstuart: 6@D will make on this deal, but it is an odds-off contract.|pg||
nt|jillan:  can't they make 6@D here as the cards break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all players are back now|pg||
nt|chorush: This hand should be played in the very good 5 diamonds. 3NT undeservedly gains 2 imps so justice not served|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: huh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry I played the wrong card brad played the squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: he guessed it?   |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: east tried a 1NT overcall in other room i d be surprised to see gitelman duplicate this|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, they are surging ahead now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wstuart: aside from being off the @SA, 6@D requires both the @H finesse and 2-1 @D which will fail 22% of the time.|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  do you confirm the score operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he made 4|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: but I had him in the dummy when he was in hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: assuming 1@s is the response here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@s does not include 5@S & 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he made 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match  push at 5@D +1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open Precision 1@C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jillan:  I know the percentage BUT you can't argue with the layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Sadam Hussein would describe this as the mother of all misfits.|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South will do well to go plus on these|pg||
nt|passell: well guessed when he ruffed the diamond north was squeezed|pg||
mb|3C!|an|5!S-4+!D-!C shortness|nt|007 joosth: what about the 1NT rebid?|pg||
nt|chorush: Most players will not rebid a 5 card minor nor reverse with such skimpy values, so 1NT is chosen as the alternative|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2 amazing hands in a row for declarer |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sure is a space-saving agreement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D is 100% game force|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, KQxxx facing the singleton are not awesome, although opener must have goodies onside to offer this " minisplinter"|pg||
mb|3D|nt|harmon: when they restarted Geoff shda passed:)|pg||
nt|ritong: with four small trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: a nightmare to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Was 3@D available?|pg||
nt|dburn: better not bid any more, or he may have a doubled nightmare to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet    2@C transfer to @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: it was alerted but no one gave any info|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly more|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|algraves: will Lauria double if Cheek bids again?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 2@s showed 6-5...|pg||
nt|ritong: this might get bloody|pg||
nt|passell: escaped the ouble  fred knows he is doing well  not chancing an accident|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: EW in trouble now|pg||
nt|ritong: at 50 a piece, though|pg||
nt|ritong: so hampson should get highly interested|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|chorush: 50 years ago it would  have been universal to open East's hand 1 heart and rebid 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: no could have been only 4 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't agree that it should show 5-6 (on the basis that North has denied four spades). That is a reasonable auction to describe a strong 4-6 hand. |pg||
nt|sybarra: N  has the hands my pards usually have :(|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|ritong: this contract has a lot of play|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h looks makeable, so Schwartz team likely gets some imps back|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman studying the trick before turning it|pg||
nt|ritong: trump looks clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: then why bid 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: no trumps etc|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: alot of pointing alerts with no written explanations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H Key Card ask for @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C=2 without Q|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ritong: 7|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz' 3H bid here is announcing some black suit worry|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: brad has doubled, and not with a trump stack|pg||
nt|ritong: so he has values, including @h control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann lowers screen, asks about carding, gitelman answers UDCA|pg||
nt|dburn: he doesn't have a bad hand for hearts, or so he hopes - that @sJ would be a working card, and he has an ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: The question was posed that if EW knew both hands, why would they not bid 6@D (not knowing the NS layout).|pg||
nt|rhelle: lead: either a small trump or the @dK|pg||
nt|harmon: prob d3 uless defense slips|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|algraves: down 2 or 3 it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, 3@d is pretty much bound to be hopeless unless partner miraculously has two of them|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever for Lauria to double, as I see it. |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: ron tried a small @h to his stiff jack, but unfortunately moss was aware about that card|pg||
nt|jillan:  because it is a poor slam|pg||
nt|chorush: mainly because it is about a 41% contract|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jillan:  it has ONE virtue - it makes|pg||
nt|harmon: need to start spades for 5th trick|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd start with @h ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel-Stansby seem to be on their way to slam too|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|ritong: no clear reason to give up on trump attack|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lauria said he miscounted last hand, thought he had 21|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: so do we have a guess re 2 @C?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did he really, though, or was that just to annoy N/S?|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally, when opps go down a bunch, the first reaction should be " hey, did we have something to play" instead of " har har har  suckers"|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dJ|nt|bg: Fred may regret tossing Dia|pg||
nt|bg: now if S ruffs a dia he cannot get off dummy without E playng another dia but he can discarf a club now Fred doent have anther dia|pg||
nt|ritong: far sighted, bruce|pg||
nt|yuval10: other room has already played twice as many boards as played here|pg||
nt|bg: if he ruffs a club now he has to finesse the dia|pg||
nt|sybarra: trans. to @D?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|wstuart: To expand on my answer from above, the @H finesse is 50% and 3-0 @D is 22%, so the slam will fail 61% of the time (0.5 * 0.22).|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chorush: Commendable bidding from EW will cost them 1 imp|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: new leader  only 58 boards remaining|pg||
mb|1C|nt|algraves: Lauria played too quickly there as it was clear to not play a third spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson's 1@C opener was 16+|pg||
mb|2N|an|reds|nt|ritong: they prolly have a tool to show 5@s 4@h limit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they are joking that it might go all pass at othe table|pg||

nt|brolucius: Looks good for a splinter bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: result is accurate|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|wstuart: Since the IMP returns are +11 IMPs for 920 vs 420 and -10 IMPs for -50 vs -400, the slam needs to be an 11:21 favorite in order to break even, wihch is 52%|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|bg: yes 2h =5spades 4 hearts|pg||
nt|chorush: That's true, Wayne, when you compare it with 5 of a minor but not when 3NT is an alternative|pg||
nt|harmon: sometimes opening light gets you, this was one of em|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco probably surprised how quickly his drek improved|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: sorry BAL 9-11|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Diamond will open 2@C  that will really change tone of auction in other room|pg||
nt|ritong: we often observe that, but again, see how experts are reluctant with stiff aces|pg||
nt|ritong: stiff ace is "total control" of the suit, but in reality it is an inactive card|pg||
mb|5H|nt|yuval10: West in the OR chose 1NT after South decided to open 1@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well my copy of convention card also says 1@C=16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: possible 11 tricks  let s see|pg||
nt|marinesa: many pairs play 2h is 5s,4h 0-9 and 2s is 5s,4h and 10-11 something in this range|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  Stansby  buys 4@H south  after  2@C-2@H-3@C-P//4@C-4@D-P-4@H//end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 4@H North|pg||
nt|ritong: here, i guess hampson, with small singleton in @c and @s Ax would have passed, offering pard to go on|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: long ause by each player at every opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to mention -- even if you lead Ace from AK -- at 5 level and higher that should switch back to King from AK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the idea is you need to know whether or not to cash out   and  higher chance that you'll want to lead unsupported Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Ace gets attitude   and King gets count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greco-Levin (screenmates) talking inaudibly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hope this hasn't been discussed already ....|pg||
nt|ritong: inactive card means it will be unuseful to develop tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think NS play Rodwell's  Inversion   where  others play DBL in Forcing Pass situations as "don't bid"  i think this DBL says the opposite -- i'm ok with you bidding more|pg||
nt|ritong: my point is, for intermediate/advanced player, it is awesome to hold stiff ace in opponent s suit|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not bad, of course, but not as great as one might think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: singleton Ace overrated in a lot of situations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or   since this is probably NOT a Forcing Pass situation   DBL may just say "extras"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: looks like 1 off, another 11 IMP swing|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe -2, actually|pg||

nt|dburn: to say nothing of 4-3 diamonds with the king right, and the heart finesse on should North lead the suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that this method appears on their card.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: 6@c demands several good news|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: but..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: the @h 9 had for purpose to diagnose if south has a stiff honor|pg||
nt|ritong: noone would cover with Hx(x)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: if 3@S was shortness   North hand has gotten much worse|pg||
nt|ritong: of course i am not aware about tarzan's subtleties|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wstuart: very true, Ira|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: however, it seems that 3@h should come from Hx rather than xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we had a system expert doing commentary last set - but it is very late where he is now  [poland]|pg||
nt|ritong: just my (uninformed) two cents|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: why tarzan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H could also have been just shape showing|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|ritong: weiss/muller|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yuval10: have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|yuval10: bye|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is not the only facetious one around this table, seems|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well bid, anyway. They are over the first hurdle of a two-hurdle-race.|pg||
nt|algraves: so all reasonable lines of play will work it seems|pg||
nt|robbg:  anyway that is backwards, if those were the only 2 possible results the needed odds would be 10/21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@C a relay rather than showing @C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: 3@D= fit and a singleton. 3@H asking etc|pg||
nt|sybarra: weiss/muller, sounds like wiesmuiler who played tarzar in 1930's (also champion swimmer)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 58  Nickell over Fleisher by a mere 4 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell original  2 seed    Fleisher  7|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, we had few opportunities to observe it, but muller is a rreal tough guy, especially in the opening lead compartiment|pg||
nt|sybarra: Johnny Weissmuller....correct spelling |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond  3 seed and Berg has risen from  22|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: fred asked about 3H and brad asked about 3D but I didn't get conclusive answers|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: a limited hand, no more than 4-5 controls|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is reassuring when he takes so long to work out the best plan. Makes you want to give up the game when they pick up 12 tricks without pausing for breath.|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not easy|pg||
nt|algraves: lol, very complicated if you are trying to make with spades 3-1 as you would like to ruff 3 clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: he may start @cA, club ruff, @dQ intending to pitch a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: or, I suppose, he may just take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: don't see any other serious runners, but far from clear which of those two is favourite|pg||
nt|harmon: I think he needs the ht finesse, but I let better analysts decide|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he may be thinking of heart finesse and then if that works to finesse club with fall back on 2-2 spades with king on side|pg||
nt|brolucius: East did choose the splinter bid art the other table and, as you see, they have netted 1430 at the other table. If you put your cursor over the result, you can see the auction.|pg||
nt|algraves: first really big hand of the match as slam may not be bid in other room|pg||
nt|algraves: oh i see|pg||
nt|algraves: that is a great feature|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump lead made it a bit easier.|pg||
nt|harmon: Fleischer leading Nickell 20-0 after 6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfe: and did not see what went under SK|pg||
nt|chorush: that's true, and not known by most players|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|harmon: Hey if Alfredo agrees with me I cant be tooo wrong|pg||
nt|brolucius: He didn't agree with you very quickly...|pg||
nt|harmon: as long as he did lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: We will see if he agrees with Allan by finessing in clubs next!|pg||
nt|rhelle: defence needs to be careful not to be thrown in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delay was NOT all player  --  i'm told connection played a role too|pg||
nt|ritong: 1 imp at stake here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at 3 years of age, chickenpox is not so bad as at 10 years of age|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greco thinking, all other players have left the room!|pg||
nt|ritong: nervous atmosphere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: just me and Greco, kinda eerie|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|algraves: lol, easy when you see all the cards|pg||
nt|harmon: Q of d my prediction|pg||
nt|ritong: so 13 it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Weinstein bid 5@C without shortness somewhere??|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: you probably know him as Olympic Swimmer|pg||
nt|ritong: ya sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: tarzan is just a comics hero:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he played Tarzan in movies |pg||
nt|sybarra: (black and white movies btw)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  Weissmuller did win a number of gold medals before becoming hollywood's tarzan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in case we forgot --- nice stop in 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell lead no just 2    5 boards to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry everyone -- i don't know if there is webcam this set|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: 5 clubs within a hair of making here|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: will eldad suggest slam?|pg||

nt|dburn: been in worse slams than 6@s on these cards|pg||

nt|dburn: sorry, than 6@c|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7|nt|dburn: although it is certainly true that I have also been in worse slams than 6@s|pg||
nt|dburn: but not as many of them|pg||

nt|chorush: We are back to the nearly 5 club hand|pg||
nt|jillan:  can you make it double dummy Ira|pg||
nt|ritong: @hs behave, so no big deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||

nt|algraves: that is an interesting treatment , lots of merit in it |pg||
nt|chorush: I don't see how unless you get a trump lead or a heart and a heart continuation|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: vulnerable brad would try|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@h = relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S 4+@S forcing   if 4@S then 5+@C/@D|pg||
mb|2N|an|4!S-5+minor|nt|bg: true Henri this is an imp scale type of hand|pg||

nt|jillan:  I ment you personally >)(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical auctions -- go figure|pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly everything behaves |pg||
nt|passell: 2dia was a winning bid if he had rebid 1nt fred would be hard pressed to raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: non vulnerable possible gain is not much bigger than possible loss|pg||
nt|ritong: so, better go quietly and avoid adrenalina rushes|pg||
nt|ritong: not that brad tends to avoid that:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@d = 3=5=4=1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sry possible correction from down 3 to down 2|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with two baby hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think if Moss thought hand was balanced he would open 1N [good 14] rather than downgrade|pg||
nt|passell: one reason I am on the side line I would rebid 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N -- YOU MADE ME BID|pg||

mb|3D|nt|chorush: you need to lead trumps twice from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry we were disconnected|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike - would you do that in your Big Club partnerships too?|pg||
nt|passell: probably open 1nt as it is in range for the big clubbers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 to play    Nickell now over Fleisher by ONE|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  you certainly need som e luck here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director has not ruled yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: score correction in the other match   4 to play, match is TIED|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if 2N guarantees the canape hand, but it   seems balanced would NOT have bid 1@S|pg||

nt|ritong: but two keys off|pg||

nt|brolucius: Versace was exhausted after the previous board and bid 3@S so that his partner could take a fair share of the work.|pg||
nt|dburn: third slam in a row|pg||
nt|ritong: he found a way to overcome 4/2@h break and, naturally, they were 3/3|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this one rather better than the last|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: another 'quiet' board - we're being spoilt tonight!|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 is better, for a full tie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel-Stansby play Flannery 2@D   if you think that is bizarre,  so do Levin-Weinstein|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mslair: likely another 13 IMPs to the Diamond team|pg||
nt|ritong: unclear|pg||
nt|ritong: brad might make it short|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mslair: short by opening 4 hearts|pg||

nt|harmon: 6h makes 6d goes down on roght lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: great EW result here|pg||
nt|harmon: yes|pg||
nt|rhelle: and 7@c is a cheap save, of course - 3 off|pg||
nt|chorush: Martel-Stansby use Flannery, which would discourage a spade overcall|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ritong: or try some joke|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman showed interest when the tray came back.  usually is very stoic|pg||
nt|ritong: good time to have a gadget for minors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another slam - just when I have to head for my wine-tasting. Ah well, it was 75 minutes very enjoyably spent. Bye!|pg||
nt|chorush: One of the disadvantages is that is allows the opponents to overcall freely at the one level. A major advantage is that it hinders the opponents from their natural bidding when ...|pg||
nt|chorush: they have the weak NT opener|pg||
nt|rhelle: as 1@d is artificial, 4@d must be pass or correct|pg||
nt|rhelle: North is looking for a save,|pg||
mb|d|nt|chorush: 2 clubs has not been alerted, but I believe it is a transfer to 2D which is a cue bid raise with 3 trumps|pg||
nt|rhelle: and will be surprised his partner's suit is @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 comparisons left|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N very anti-systemic according to my copy of their CC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best retort:  they also play flannery, or they also think it's bizarre? :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@D = 6/9 4 cartas|pg||
nt|ritong: greco has not a great hand, and the @ss behind him do not improve matters|pg||
nt|ybob: sry private|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time i did not intend double entendre -- but it turned out to be decent straight line|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bg: NS have 7 losers hope they do not vul get them into unprofitable sac|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|dburn: and seven making on a fluke if you accidentally bid it|pg||
nt|chorush: Martel must now have a way to show his strong NT|pg||
nt|harmon: he knows his suit is clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: north wrote to east that he "thought 3d showed diamonds but not 100% sure"|pg||
nt|harmon: pard asked for d stop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D meant to be mixed??  or is that their preempt|pg||
nt|chorush: I think it is mixed|pg||
mb|4D|nt|chorush: Most experts play that 2 spades is Nickells weakest action|pg||
nt|rhelle: does he? Partner can't have @ds after the precision 1@d opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: at least that is what the note said|pg||
nt|harmon: oh ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: not sure how east kept a straight face during that explanation|pg||

nt|chorush: Which seems an overstatement, if true|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chorush: Pass would be stronger|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 2NT forcing, no doubt a useful treatment, but Versace is a bit cramped for room now|pg||
nt|rhelle: 5NT = pick a slam, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i scrambled thinking 1st seat favorable MIGHT be 9-12 but nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Lauria has shown 16+ with 5+@d 4@H and no 3@ss|pg||
nt|rhelle: asking partner to choose between 6@d and 6@h|pg||
nt|rhelle: great bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: pick a slam sort of bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT probably denies 6 @ds now|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes 5NT= pick a slam|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ritong: pachtmann lost a big chance imho|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h will sound bizarre to fred's ear|pg||
nt|ritong: if any:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL either Responsive  [since hampson essentially bid 3@H]  or specifically showing @D length  [suggested by Weinsteins 4@D]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 hands in a row where opening bid made huge difference in rest of auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@D meant as natural|pg||

nt|algraves: well bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz' double was a very good tactic; he really wanted the opps out of 3NT looking at his club holding|pg||
nt|jillan:  well done!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. this table is WAY behind|pg||
pc|d9|nt|algraves: well he was probably no 0454 as no 3@C so 6@C 1453|pg||
nt|harmon: 6n wrong sided but safe|pg||

pc|s8|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: did Greco give declarer a chance for extra trick by failure to split honors?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit of a Grosvenor|pg||
nt|chorush: Weinstein has picked up 2 pieces of news, both bad.  Trumps are not splitting and the club ace is wrong|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Hampson could have scored both of his trump tricks on this line|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|algraves: some might open east hand 1NT or if 1@D then rebid 2@C afraid to reverse with marginal reversing values so credit to Lauria for just bidding naturally |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: levin will say " sry mate" and weinstein " np  i would do same"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, if game is cold and his counterparts find @ds too, it would be an important loss|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: So Katz' double transformed a loss to a gain. Hard to blame Stansby for thinking that 3NT wasn't going to make|pg||

mb|5D|nt|dburn: were they? wasn't North going to be show-up-squeezed in hearts and clubs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sry i always try to say when declarer claims t1 because people ask why I didn't type in the cards that went by|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually other room only on 59   but other match at least 4 boards faster|pg||
nt|ritong: muller has to move|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and good interference in our room too|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 3@s is @s and @c, since likely 2@s would be forcing already|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  13 is that pushed grand|pg||
nt|chorush: They have received the same sort of preemption here with one important difference: Greco knows that Hampson has a GAME FORCE with spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director just walked in, warning upcoming|pg||
nt|chorush: In the other room it went 1C-1D-1S so North's hand was very ill-defined|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ritong: mrs greenberg is brad's mom|pg||
nt|algraves: so cheek and gure play negative doubles after 2NT unusual|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: south said he was able to pitch|pg||
nt|chorush: A double by Katz here might have turned what will be a minus into a plus|pg||
nt|jillan:  yes a double from Katz wold have made it a bit simpled for Nickell|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 2@s hoping pard can bid NTs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: greco hand is HUGE on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: grue coulda pitched his q of d|pg||
nt|dburn: he was right about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting DBL|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what, south has a rockcrusher for @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can Hampson envision @H void?    no way they bid the grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but big gain just be getting to 6level|pg||
nt|chorush: Since Hampson has received a grand slam invitation, he may be able to bid it now with his trumps|pg||
mb|6S|nt|harmon: no diff|pg||
nt|wstuart: Surely Nick will bid here, prob 5@C rather than 4NT.|pg||
nt|chorush: Mind you Katz has a terrible hand but he does have what he knows are a wasted AK of hearts|pg||
nt|wstuart: wrong again.|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: grue needed Q10 of d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||

nt|ritong: on the other hand, he s not certain small slam will be bid other room|pg||

nt|chorush: Hampson Greco will worry that they have lost 13 imps and be very pleased to discover they have won 13|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|rhelle: and another interesting hand ...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rhelle: 1@s = relay|pg||
mb|2S|nt|algraves: how does he make after the ruff sluff?|pg||
nt|chorush: Its a good question Al, but with his Jxxx of trumps I personally don't think he would bid 6D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe the real point    opponent interference makes confident small/grand slam bidding very difficult|pg||
mb|d!|an|support|nt|ahollan1: with 3 to score   O'Rourke leads Nickell by 7|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think DBL showed a 5+ card minor + 4 card major?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|hedyg: 1@H or 1@s?|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = 4+ @s|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@c = relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since other room didn't get to slam    small vs grand  insignificant imp difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director "you need to hurry"|pg||
mb|d|nt|wstuart: It's interesting that Martel didn't jam with 3@H here - I guess he thought he had enough defense with both majors that he wasn't worried about getting outbid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: diredctor "the boards ween't that hard at at any other table"|pg||
nt|ritong: ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other match has finished 1st Quarter    Grue over Kang  57-35|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: hampson " i promise we won't play ant faster with you standing over the table"|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
mb|r|nt|rhelle: 3@h = 4=6=2=1 exactly|pg||
nt|chorush: battle of nerves here|pg||
nt|poohbear: The  " I hope they run " redouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice Support DBL even when Hampson's 1@S implies 5+|pg||
nt|chorush: 4Hxx down 2 with trumps led early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i say implies since not sure if they'll bid 1@S with really good 4-card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 3@h now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought previous set 1N was Semi-Force     maybe Semi over 1@H and absolute over 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: can t be 4, since 2@d denied 4@h imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: he cant unless ht onside that was my point|pg||
nt|harmon: Im glad u know the relays Rob:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: by heart :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I try to get the info the write down on notepads and pass around but sometimes no one asks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they|pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North has choices ... 3@s = strong relay, only asks controls|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c = weak relay, asks for max and controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: before everyone yelled at mne lol|pg||
nt|chorush: Not that often that 2NT is right as "save" over 2 spades; here it is going to make when 2 spades also would have made (I think)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@d = signoff, asks partner to bid 4@h, so that he can pass or bid the final contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: lets see if fred can save 1 imp making 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss trying to find an escort to leave the room and ginossar tells him just to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some back and forth between boards about the alleged tempo break|pg||
nt|wstuart: is it better for katz to dbl again?|pg||
nt|rhelle: and 4@s = a slight invitation|pg||
nt|chorush: potentially 600 coming provided a trump shift is made after the first club lead|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|wstuart: Asked by a spec;  I think His DBL of 2@S is probably more strongly penalty oriented.|pg||
nt|chorush: Depends on what their methods are. They might as well not play 2 spades dbld because I don't think they will beat it. Could be wrong though|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: whoa baby   Fleisher just picked up another 10    2 to play  Fleisher leads Nickell by 16|pg||
nt|ritong: fred could try for slam|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think Fleisher vs Diamond would be rematch from final of the 2010 Team Trials  and  final of 2010 spingold??|pg||
nt|ritong: his hand is limited|pg||
nt|ritong: but he took the low road|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: Greco should get this right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: nearly 30 minutes behind|pg||
nt|chorush: A spec has pointed out that Levin's redbl will cost only 3 imps relative to passing and that it had the potential to turn a minus into a plus|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if hampson had played !AH @H  then might be harder for south|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|imp_jan: yess|pg||
nt|rodal f: Good conrol EW now, I belive.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|rodal f: control*|pg||
nt|imp_jan: usually 2n is a relay asking for lenght and strenght|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway a force|pg||
nt|henryb:  both tables in the other match bid this grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Vugraphzfc: 2N asks, usually shows shape|pg||
nt|imp_jan: seems poss as opps cant interfere..|pg||
nt|henryb:  In most methods it asks whether opener has four trumps|pg||
nt|imp_jan: indeed|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and a rebid in a m shows length in m and denies 4crd supp|pg||
nt|imp_jan: does that make west happy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: well, he's scratching head, opening and folding cards, so maybe not so much|pg||
nt|imp_jan: he is sure about six, but how to find out about the grand?|pg||
nt|henryb:  some play a step kind of rebid: 3@c = min, 3 trumps, 3@d = max, 3 trumps, higher bids show four trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|imp_jan: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  but in a big club context it probably makes more sense to show minor suit length with 3 of a minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems ure right there Henry.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|po-s: probably better to reverse the first two steps, gives room to switch trumps at a conveient level|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: trumps are set on the auction, but their writing is small and confusing, that is all i am sure of|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|rodal f: 4@C que    5@C=0-3?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@C kick back?|pg||
nt|henryb:  4N would be 2 with the Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|Vugraphzfc: 5@H was king ask, 6@C shows @H K, no minor Ks|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|henryb:  but who actually knows (except John and Brian)? :)|pg||
nt|po-s: he better be careful - soon East might pass a club bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|imp_jan: hm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: something rotten here|pg||
nt|henryb:  Maybe they are in Denmark?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: played the club 9 on the last|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sort of my way of saying  --   i don't think any single player is to blame for this table being slow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond-Platnick stopped in 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1@c = 16+|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rhelle: 1@d = 0-8|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: for the extra trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: then claimed|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: 6 diamonds was a great result in the other room  a bad contract that made|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: thought Acol introduced 2N as invite  and artificial Game Force was Ozzie & Jim Jacoby  early 60s??|pg||
nt|harmon: oh yea lol|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@h = 19+|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Does the 3rd segment of these 64 boards start at 8p local time (5p BBO time)?|pg||
nt|wstuart: The operator says yes.|pg||
nt|chorush: The 3 dominant teams in American bridge over the past couple of years have been the two you are watching here and Diamond. The winner of this match will face Diamond should Diamond ...|pg||
nt|chorush: win today|pg||
nt|jillan:  will maybe be in bed by then...it is 11 pm here now...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THIS is the hand that was pushed at 7@S= min the Grue-Kang match|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: not sure about their style, but this @c Ax is surely worth an effort|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C must deny 3+@S|pg||
nt|wstuart: Spec asks what is the diff between the 2@S cue and a potential 2@C cue.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h = 2=2=5=4 exactly, 6-8 points|pg||
nt|passell: moss may raise 5dia though|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: hard not to|pg||
mb|3C|nt|wstuart: Many play that the higher cue is more trumps and less HCP then the lower cue.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h also promises at least 1 control, so North will be wondering what to do next. 6@d looks possible|pg||
nt|harmon: can he have 2 controls??|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s asks for controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|hedyg: bd 9 6NT +1|pg||
nt|passell: well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder what 2@S-P-P-4@S shows?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S-P-P-4@C/@D often @H & the minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would have been relay for more info    not sure about implications of direct 3@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: just not sure if 6th @C shown|pg||
nt|chorush: different pairs have different uses. Could be 2 spades shows 4 card support and 2C shows 3. Each to his own|pg||
nt|passell: needs 2 3-2 breaks and a lot more|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think double dummy defense can set this 4    starts with @H lead|pg||
nt|ritong: now a battle of undertricks|pg||
nt|ritong: three looks like a lot of them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then they must untangle @S winners while retaining transportation in @H -- extremely unlikely|pg||
nt|bg: rebid of the minor usually shows 6 with 3 hearts better to raise hearts with unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ritong: but|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Bruce -- but there is slight impact playing transfer responses|pg||
nt|ritong: try @c hook, loses, a @h back|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 11 3@H -2|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: now the contract makes with @d K on|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: depending on 1N rebid -- 1@H can be used to show exactly 3@H [1N=weak balanced hand] or 2/3@H  [1N=18-19]|pg||
nt|harmon: Hedy why u disconnect tables??|pg||
nt|ritong: offer him an entry!|pg||
nt|passell: if the Q of clubs didnt fall would need that hand to have 2 trumps|pg||
nt|ritong: pitch @d J|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: i like how he thinks  he says sorry if you can make 7|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ritong: so 3@h 2@s 1@c 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann picked up his bidding cards, trying to end the auction before the tray passed back. perhaps has given up|pg||
nt|hedyg: moi?|pg||
nt|harmon: vous|pg||
nt|hedyg: jamais!|pg||
nt|hedyg: score is 28-7|pg||
nt|hedyg: for Cayne|pg||
nt|wstuart: However, there is a difference when you have overcalled 1M and 1m - when you've overcalled 1m 3NT is a likely contract and it is useful to play that you cue the one that you have a ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: stopper in, while after 1M the number of trumps and hand type is more important.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he is facing his hand|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't know what the NS undersdtanding is here.|pg||
nt|jillan:  a wll played match with a lot of interesting hands and actions|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann toying with his cards, trick 1 still faced|pg||
nt|chorush: This seems very hard hand to bid to grand because each hand had features that are essential to the success of the contract and they meld very well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good idea from spec   2N with 4@S  other bids guarantee 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S = 2 Key Cards + Q|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rhelle: at least they managed to right-side it - should be a few overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not clear if Levin has shown @C shortness|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|ritong: steve won t like the dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: too good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now it is clear that Levin did NOT ever show his @C singleton|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: tsk tsk|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bg: do you try to make or play dia ace and concede down one;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen lowered while moss whispers a question|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: stretches, sighs, cracks his knuckles behind his head|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: certainly not acting like the match is decided|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@C was natural slam try -- then Levin 4@C probably shows @C HONOR  rather than shortness|pg||
pc|c7|nt|harmon: Versace/Lauria playing GREAT!!!!|pg||

nt|dburn: well, if their opponents had made 6NT at the other table, they might not want it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helps to have sequence that shows invite with exactly 4333|pg||
nt|dburn: 6NT was... well, I've seen worse|pg||
nt|passell: moss gittleman having their way here  their team mates dont suspect they are in this great shape|pg||
nt|warrens:  isn't it about 70%, either a finesse or 3-3 @C's or a black suit squeeze|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot worse, to be honest - almost convincing myself it's a good contract|pg||
nt|passell: yes  at least 70 percent slam|pg||
nt|ritong: i would be very sad not to be in it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: having seen Brad in action -- might just bid 6N here|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||

nt|hedyg: live streaming from the OR: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|dburn: but it would have been wrong to bid eight - that really was against the odds|pg||

nt|wstuart: *Chip's|pg||
nt|ritong: but things do not come to slam|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: untouchable today|pg||

nt|ritong: but imps no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: even if few|pg||
nt|hedyg: far left is Cayne, far right Amoils|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle: with the @hs breaking 22|pg||
nt|dburn: when did this match start?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Nick won't|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's interesting that EW do'nt ahve any special methods here to try and get the contract played by the hand that has a @C stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: long ago|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, on approximately what day?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chorush: 2:25 ago|pg||
nt|ritong: hampson and the director won t go to holidays together|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting non-strength showing reverse in comp   when partner has implied no 4-card major|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: but as we see  Weinstein obviously does bid 1N over DBL with 4-card major  so good to have partnership agreement|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chorush: Guess that is commentator's curse|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's reasonable to play pass to say he doesn't have any reason for a @C lead to come up to his hand, then try and get the major suit contracts played by east, who might have a @C ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: stopper.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: and a @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d by Versace would have shown both majors|pg||
nt|rhelle: the @C 9 was upside down count - the @s2 upside down attitude|pg||
nt|rhelle: so North has an odd number of @cs and likes @ss|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wstuart: I think this might make double dummy.|pg||

nt|ritong: yoou are in zeitnot when alloted time is almost trespassed   chess expression|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: forgotten :)|pg||
nt|passell: 4 spades is the best spot here also|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzfe: fred calling cards more audibly this hand|pg||
nt|multiphren: it means you do not have to write down your moves anymore zeitnot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like German or Yiddish word|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bergen would bid 1@S-3@S   that might convince East to Pass|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and probably easier to find 9 tricks in 3@S than in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which really?   3@S with West   or   Pass from East??|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean 1) would bergen preempt two passed hands and 2) would west give up?|pg||
nt|ritong: esat*|pg||
nt|ritong: east**|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure 3@S -- descriptive     East Passing -- that's why i said "might"  only 5 trump, 3 quick outside losers [3@S won't have Ace]|pg||
nt|dinos1: german, zeit = time|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|rhelle: and that is 9 tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: it is German - it literally means "time need"|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: hi larry|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfe: room is actually clearing out|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bg: does bergen apply by a passed hand? 3s is just a preempt with good hands use drury|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course playing the @s 10 is his only legitimate chance of making his contract|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 3 results posted at http://bridgewinners.com/round-of-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell showing as +3 but unofficial|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: no finals posted yet  but they'll filter in to   http://bridgewinners.com/round-of-8|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S still preempt -- but 2N/3@C/3@D meanings do change by passed hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: make opponents guess  --  that is key feature of these top level matches  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not only in bidding -- but also during play/defense|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: why no 1NT opening in S?|pg||
nt|dburn: he wants the finesse to be right, beacause then maybe his opponents could make 4@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|imp_jan: one brd in segment 1 that is|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: last board.  thanks all for watching.  quarterfinals start tomorrow at 1pm EDT|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play variable 14-16 and 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Jan must have reconnected|pg||
nt|algraves: they play more like 13 to bad 16|pg||
nt|wstuart: An interesting consideration on these 3NT rebids is what opener's holding in responder's suit is - it's reasonable to define it as with showing 1 or less or 2 or more.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: There are many slam hands where that is the crucial and hard to determine peice of information if you don't ahve a specific agreemnt.|pg||
nt|rhelle: very hard to see ... you see, even at this level they slip up in defence|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: but teams can agree to start earlier|pg||
nt|ritong: an other difficult decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok we have the scores now, great!|pg||
nt|algraves: versace right on the rule of 2 or 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 tricks, no outside defense, classic|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: when raised, what to do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 1pm EDT = 5pm GMT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S easy  -- Moss 4@S probably easy too  since @Dxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're actually ahead of other room now!!|pg||
mb|1N|an|F|nt|rhelle: 1@d = 11-15, 3+@d, unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is a real chance for Fleisher|pg||
nt|dburn: five diamonds (even six diamonds) look vastly preferable to 3NT|pg||
nt|wstuart: Prob 2NT showing the str NT?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: enterprising 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Open Room  Greco thought a long time before passing 3@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: short break and then 2nd segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if in 4@S, i think declarer has a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: take the plus|pg||
nt|algraves: and lauria adds his three tricks and there you have it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wot hapen there?|pg||
nt|wstuart: but Chip will likely just kick it in to 3NT knowing he is facing at least some @H wastage for a slam.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could bid 3@h, just to make sure|pg||
nt|wstuart: true, they still have chances here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: good match, shakes hands with opps.  fred: good play cashing @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: thsi must imply a @D fit.|pg||
nt|ritong: no tilt|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Stanby probably will bid 3S|pg||
nt|ritong: muller is a great player|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and quick refresh now shows Grue [original 21] beat Cayne [ 4]     Fleisher [7] over Nickell [2]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i mentioned because South hand opposite a 14-16 NT improved during the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: well done Chip - knew you wouldn't let me down|pg||
nt|wstuart: I assume 3@C after 2NT would not have been forcing.|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know enuf about their methods|pg||
nt|wstuart: Although, after a 2 level nerg DBL opposite a str NT it seems like it should be.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h looks like a make - especially with the @d Ace before the king|pg||
nt|rhelle: a game on pretty minimal values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play precision so 3@S weaker than playing 'standard'|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if EW negotiate @C ruff beat is easy|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the other room North opened 1NT - for reasons he better understand than I|pg||
nt|rhelle: and they made slam tried, all the way to 5@h :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: this was a very exciting set, been a long time since I saw so many swings|pg||
nt|rhelle: at this level, that is - my Monday night game produces them as well :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chorush: Katz is going to have a good idea what to lead if it plays here|pg||
nt|wstuart: Chip's sequence expresses doubt about 3NT and Lew's stopper is surely about as weak as they come.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - he cant pass, can he?|pg||
nt|lc: I always tell my students : "Don't lay down"  or "underlead" aces.  I hope they don't see this deal. :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|algraves: now diamond and diamond will eventually beat it|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in real world ...|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he can't|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lc: Of course, after @CA, @C, West would have to switch to SPADES -- not DIAMONDS to beat it.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzfe: my computer is having some problem|pg||
nt|algraves: now Versace will have to guess TX in trumps to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: just a little bit more Liz! |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we will be back about 15 minutes after all finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry lag not responding|pg||
nt|algraves: pershaps south did overtake and it was missed by recorder|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he just misguessed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I tried to key it|pg||
nt|algraves: thrid diamond, and if neccessary 4th diamond promotes trump ten|pg||
nt|hedyg: np Liz, you didnt a good job! thanks @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: you did a good job* my keyboard too!|pg||
nt|algraves: even if south did not overtake it seems natural for West to misguess the third diamond after south wins trump ace|pg||
nt|sillafu: how can he misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: Liz it is minus 1 for sure?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the result of -1 confirmed|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now they need to not overstate their values.|pg||
nt|wstuart: VWD for Martel-Stansby!|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a reason they have won so many championships.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chorush: looks like this one can't be beaten|pg||
nt|wstuart: (VWD = very well done)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: Diamond also in 4@S on  14   but Stansby never bid with North hand|pg||

mc|11|nt|ritong: merci a tous   see you soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they finished all boards!!   that was far from automatic 25 minutes ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  15 minute break after other room finishes|pg||
nt|chorush: actually "only" 20 minutes late|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2 minutes late|pg||
nt|chorush: with screens they allow about 2:15 for 16 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all rooms will start at the same time, with duplicated hands|pg||
