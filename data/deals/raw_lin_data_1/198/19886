nt|vugraphzkg: ...hii all...welcome back...good evening all...:)|pg||
nt|runnerup: some challence but 4 @h makes as cards are|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharkey: i know the EW pair - assume they play natural - perhaps with transfers after 1@C opening|pg||

nt|poky: hi all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: By East, not a pleasant spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...welcome back all...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Tomi and Rodal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a hard force by an 8er.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...well...we have problems...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Shows spade support|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: NS on vrong table...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh right|pg||
nt|rodal f: Eve for u two Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S pair not on the AJ Connector team|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi again Tomislav|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@C = weak 2 or strong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...this is second day of open teams in Pula....7th round...enjoy...|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: and Dean|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poky: hi all|pg||
pc|h7|nt|finch:  3NT is also hopeless on a heart lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyone might take a while in 4@c! after all, until you finish playing the hand you aren't down yet|pg||
nt|jallerton: the play in 3NT will be faster|pg||
nt|dimi: Hi Roland and Dean|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears the 2@C opening got EW too high here|pg||
nt|runnerup: north pays for him having a sidesuit this time |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|finch:  Shows the effect of pre-empting, it made West decide to force to game (quite reasonably)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...hii all...welcome back...|pg||
nt|dimi: hello Carl|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hii Dean, hii Roland, hii all...:)|pg||
nt|poky: NS is one of best croatian pairs and thay play a pretty sopisticated system full of 2way bids|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Dimitri & Dean|pg||
nt|poky: this one meant: w2@D or 20+|pg||
nt|runnerup: south thought he is balanced 4-3-3-3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|gsper:  6@C makes but is not a good contract.|pg||
nt|poky: NS are a young croatian pair. they play a fairly natural system with mini 1NT|pg||
nt|runnerup: clever switch |pg||
pc|s2|nt|finch:  and they end up in a hopeless contract in a combined 23-count|pg||
nt|penseur9: looks like 3@C will go down here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gsper:  Ty, Dean. Valuable info. Any about EW methods?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gsper:  To put it mildly.|pg||
nt|penseur9: :) I'm always a mild person :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  E-W will gain two imps in this undignofied contract|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|penseur9: I can appreciate Lindermann dilmna here|pg||
nt|runnerup: but declarer got it rigth|pg||
pc|dT|nt|poky: sorry, I do not know nothing about the austrian pair|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Hi Tomislav, specs and co commentators.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gsper:  Franz Terraneo used to play Blue Team Club 30 years ago.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|finch:  they can call it a good save against 3H on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|poky: good stop in 5@C, pity that whole @DKQ is on and slam could be made|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|poky: I'm informed that EW probably play strong 1@C with canape openings (4carder majors)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  or against 4@h, which is cold double dummy on any lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|finch:  down 1?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2 down I think|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dimi: probelm with multi openings is: what to do after after a lot of bidding by opponents|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Now we get the right pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...sry for a delay all...enjoy now....:)|pg||
nt|poky: a variant of the Blue Club system|pg||
nt|penseur9: I've been trying to reach the sight for overall results with partial success: http://www.crobridge.com/pula/eng/|pg||
nt|poky: 4@S that is hard to beat on this one|pg||
nt|gsper:  5@DX in other room, so it may have paid not to find @D.|pg||
nt|penseur9: good point|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sharkey: EW got off cheaply NV|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 NT now?|pg||
nt|poky: as you can see, NS are pretty aggressive bidders|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|dimi: 3nt can be made i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit strange nick at east. Will not tell what it mean in Norwegian. Better that he do down there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkg: ...lead from wrong side...director called...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Willl W overrule E.|pg||
nt|penseur9: who would jump to 4@S here?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  That is a Very forcing NT|pg||
nt|gsper:  Though it is close to making now!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dimi: 4@h fails by @s ruff|pg||
nt|poky: besides that, N is often very practical - he mostly bid what he thinks he could make|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2@S should make here but with little to spare|pg||
nt|penseur9: wow... 5@D made in CR for 12 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: ...an doubles whatever he thinks can set :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: on  1 I mean|pg||
pc|c6|nt|poky: well, maybe not so hard if N will be so brave to underlead hearts (after the natural @h lead) to get @C back|pg||
nt|poky: surely, he is capable of those moves|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Slam try from W.|pg||
nt|gsper:  5@H would have been a good sac IF 4@S makes.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|poky: lets see|pg||
nt|poky: good @H10|pg||
nt|poky: faking QT|pg||
nt|poky: very nice play by Terraneo|pg||
nt|poky: will this trap be enough?|pg||
nt|poky: well, to be honest, from 964 south would have lead the 4|pg||
nt|poky: since they lead 3/5, not MUD|pg||
nt|poky: Stankovic should get it right|pg||
nt|gsper:  But presumably 6 from 64|pg||
nt|poky: this is surely possible|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: 3 NT play better than 4@H I think|pg||
nt|runnerup: overbid is the most obvious treat here,but west didnt believe in just rigth cards and rigth he was|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jallerton: it's either forcing or it isn't|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Ryszard|pg||
nt|gsper:  !|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodal f: W a well known player from Norway         and E better than his brother? |pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: :)  Henry loves that debate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I had it with him the other day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I claim that thereis no such thing as semi-forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but most who play forcing NT do not include game forces in the bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either a bid is forcing or it is not|pg||
nt|finch:  semi-forcing NT is about as meaningful as grand slam force (which at least is forcing!)|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes just right|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bob Holl|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poky: excellent play by Andrea!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jallerton: I disagree. If you don't include any game forces in your 1NT response then why play it as forcing?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By NT at the right hand...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ryskiel_: good evening - I m Ryszard Kielczewski from Poland|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dimi: Dean what is the temperature in Pula ?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|poky: as I predicted :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: I asked Henry if a woman can be semi-pregnant. He did not reply. Either she is or she is not, period.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Nice to see u.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|finch:  Declarer has a difficult problem on the club back|pg||
nt|finch:  he might need the finesse for his 9th trick, but if the majors come in and East has the @CK he's just off by finessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: yeah but no diffrent which card to play here:) lucky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Forcing 1N was originally used to allow invitational hands to bid 1N rather than at the two level, and facilitate 2/1 gf|pg||
nt|finch:  I wonder what declarer can infer from West winning the first spade with the queen and the second with the 10|pg||
nt|finch:  what holdings would do that?|pg||
nt|jallerton: KQ10 and KQ104|pg||
nt|finch:  or as has just be suggested to me, someone with the @CK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think if E had the @ck he would have returned the @d2|pg||
nt|finch:  there are plenty of positions where you just don't bother given suit preference without an ace|pg||
nt|finch:  and this is one of them|pg||
nt|jallerton: @s 3-3 seems more likely than @s4-2 with both rounded suits coming in|pg||
nt|finch:  why would East want to help declarer by showing whether or not he has the @CK?|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: stil thinking|pg||
nt|rodal f: @SK and a @C?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not a great result for N-S|pg||
nt|finch:  admittedly not very likely, but an extra chance|pg||
nt|dimi: only, well i was the last 2 years in Pula and i think it was a littel bit warmer even in the night:)|pg||
nt|poky: 1@C with transfer responses here|pg||
nt|gsper:  Is Andrea male or female?|pg||
nt|poky: Male|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 7 than 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hii Roland, Bob an Povl and all kibs...welcome all....:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: double or 2@C now as west ?|pg||
nt|penseur9: now it's North with long suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Fun to come here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|sharkey: Can they bid slam?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @s only -1|pg||
mb|5S|nt|poky: S hand is between 2@C/3@C/2@H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: we can saw Grzegorz Narkiewicz, silver medalist of European Championships from Ostend and bronze medalist in Open Pairs - Pozna 2011|pg||
nt|poky: even though Andrea is most often a female name, even here in Croatia|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  I think they must have had a bidding misunderstanding at the other table|pg||
nt|rodal f: If precission 2@C are ok. But some might love a 3@C opening for pressure.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: likely to bid slam now that 2@c has been opened, one would think|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes -2 overruff |pg||
nt|rodal f: Well done by EW|pg||
mb|6H|nt|sommer: X ok followed by 3@C ..as done|pg||
nt|poky: probably 2@C is the best bid, because it carries most flexibility|pg||
nt|gsper:  This should not make I believe, but things happen.|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like -50 .meanwhile @s is -140 ,but not so easy to come in|pg||
nt|penseur9: NS certainly like to open light but may pay off here|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch:  after a 2@C opening and a heart suit, North has a virtual slam force|pg||
nt|rodal f: An X to come from E?|pg||
nt|gsper:  None of the names here make the gender clear to a Scandiavian.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@H should set the suit and ask for a cuebid|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3nt is gone as it was after they supported each other in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: nasty 5:0 break in @d ... d! slam will be hard to make|pg||
nt|poky: but as I already told, they both like to bid it aggressively :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: North will have a problem showing the power of his @D suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: his partner Cezary Serek grow up as bridge player only few years ago bu climbed in his bridge skilfull|pg||
nt|penseur9: In French we have André= male and Andrée = female|pg||
nt|chrisky: hi to all  3@S is safe here|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Chris welcome|pg||
nt|penseur9: ho ho|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  the old-fashioned way to play is the 3@H asks for a first round control, responder bids 3NT with a king but no ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which it probably did|pg||
nt|jallerton: assuming 2@C was their strongest bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: But N will not give up.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|finch:  with that understanding 3@S showed the ace|pg||
nt|poky: strange bit, it should be stopper asking and not hidden suit showing|pg||
pc|d4|nt|poky: but, to be honest, they like to be very creative in most undiscussed sequences :)|pg||
nt|poky: bit=bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps N shud have shown @D suit first - then bid @S twice...|pg||
nt|poky: this wasn't possible|pg||
nt|poky: because 1@S response is relayish, it doesn't show @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt 1@S show @D suit or NT?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|finch:  but with that understanding so did 5@C, so they may be cuebidding first or second|pg||
nt|finch:  redouble here will show first round club control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't he also bid 3NT with a singleton, Frances? Any second round control? I don't know Acol that well|pg||
nt|finch:  yes, sorry, 3NT with a second round control; cue with a first round control|pg||
nt|henryb:  As I played that, 3@s showed the @sA and no other ace. 4N would show two aces|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|poky: 1NT would have been invitational for the balanced range|pg||
nt|runnerup: Lindermann took his view and wrong this time|pg||
nt|penseur9: one @D too many|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jallerton: In original Acol, you were supposed to make a positive on any hand with 2 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to André Vallée|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hii :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: Hi Tomislav|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|poky: and 1@S is showing all the weak hands w/o 4M and some strong hands|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: possibly make 10 tricks - but both sides have his troubles|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gsper:  So N passed 3d hand, at favourable in other room. Some people just don't do that at all.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was that last @D by any|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|dimi: agressive X ... demands the @d lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont like Herland's x - might have saved NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: Though 6@D down on split|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes should have had 10 @h -not only 9 --reary such suit appears|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|poky: aggressive bidding with thin values and misfit in spades backfires|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jallerton: 5NT should show something extra but no further 2nd round control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to play, not so at the table|pg||
nt|bobholl: J would have been easier for P :)|pg||
nt|sommer: very lucky start for the young, nice ladies from Austria10 + 11 from "nowhere" (6@D was too hard)|pg||
nt|poky: 1@D opened here because 1NT would have been 9-12|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|poky: but it is only -1 since the @H lead didn't come|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - Herland asked for @S lead - dummy's first bid suit?|pg||
nt|poky: yeah|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, I thought I was in 7|pg||
nt|finch:  yes I think 6 isn't so hard|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suppose the right way to play this is @cA, @c ruff, @h, @c ruff, @d finesse|pg||
nt|finch:  not in 6 it isn't|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not?|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d ruff?|pg||
nt|finch:  the ace of diamonds might get ruffed off|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, making 7 is an imp|pg||
nt|henryb:  Once both opponents follow to three clubs and one heart, the probability of a stiff diamond becomes vanishingly small|pg||
nt|finch:  so you need it to be a smaller chance than 1 in 21 that there is a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Chris Hatzopoulos|pg||

mb|2C|mb|3S|nt|danilo1: guess 6@H doubled by East (on the lead) final|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|othered1: Here, too, Blue Team makes east's first action different from Standard 5-card majors.  West could have @Sxxxx for his opening|pg||
nt|othered1: what was 2@C and why?|pg||
nt|danilo1: if table present, with @S fit, East should judge no clear Dble on 5@H ... and if East pass, than Wast has to bod 5@S|pg||
nt|danilo1: but what about South is thinking .. he already bid @D (2@C is @D transfer) .. ans single @H .. thk about Dbling - with no controls?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|othered1: I've had about all possible suggestions including, "maybe old style negative bid -- first unbid suit 0-6 points."|pg||

mb|p|nt|chrisky: what finesse you make @S or @H|pg||
nt|poky: 3@S here was a simple game choice between 3NT and 4@H, cause NT has to be played from the right (stronger) side|pg||

nt|poky: Fantunes styled openings on 2nd position|pg||

nt|gsper:  According to a kib: EW very modified Acol, weak NT, 1,3,5.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Though this board does not seem very inspiring:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|finch:  3-3 is probably sufficient to make it though|pg||
nt|jallerton: defending 2@sx would do instead|pg||
nt|bobholl: good fit bid |pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is good sac and puts pressure on S|pg||

nt|rodal f: One round force by 1NT|pg||
nt|gsper:  More or less:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|finch:  this auction is typically used to show a hand too good to overcall 2NT the first round|pg||

nt|sharkey: cud be -800...|pg||
nt|poky: 3@S by north|pg||

nt|rodal f: E feelt bad by his opening?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Shall we guess 7 tricks?|pg||
nt|gsper:  3@S, 1@D and 3@C, though one more could easily happen.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I did not notice that EW use 4 card major. So 1NT was not force.|pg||
nt|penseur9: usually with 4 card support and 6-9 points... should he bid 3@H instead of two?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  W pass in 3d hand a little surprising, but there have been no suitable bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: quite obvious, tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  I woud rather have expected D.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|penseur9: 2@C should make if declarer figures out the trump distribution|pg||
nt|poky: aggressive raise to the game|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jallerton: @ha, duck a @h, lead towards K|pg||
nt|finch:  declarer can afford to play ace of hearts and duck a heart before playing towards the queen|pg||
nt|finch:  hearts are very likely to be 4-2 from 2@S bid selected by West|pg||
nt|poky: N opts to describe his hand|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes a little|pg||
pc|dK|nt|poky: which is strange|pg||

nt|vugraphzna: small break here|pg||
nt|jallerton: Blame whoever invented the "law" of total tricks|pg||
nt|poky: and I'm told they are on good road to 7NT|pg||
nt|dimi: 7NT for E-W|pg||
nt|poky: the only problem is, they cannot show 8carder suits|pg||
nt|poky: only 7+ carder|pg||
nt|sharkey: Namyats wud be effective here - showing solid Major|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt for ns|pg||
nt|gsper:  -1. Could declarer have handled his communications better?|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new discusion EW?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|poky: W opens the bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: that makes a difference....|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: hardly anyone plays 1@H-4@D as Namyats for spades :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some hopefully learnd a bit now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some slam to see now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: you migth loose entry to your hand in 4 @s here -if bidden|pg||
mb|2H|nt|finch:  South has plenty of ways to show a strong spade raise here, so 3@S is a nice semi-preemptive call|pg||
nt|penseur9: will they go higher though?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C as semi @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: n derves a 4@H bid now :(|pg||
nt|sommer: inventive 1NT, but how did 4@S go 2 down??|pg||
nt|bobholl: deserves|pg||
nt|sharkey: havent seen that recently....:)|pg||
nt|poky: maybe someone will find the unlucky 7@H?|pg||
nt|rodal f: *@D|pg||
nt|runnerup: nicely found slam in other table|pg||
mb|3C|an|!|nt|finch:  North still has much the same problem, with 7 of the things|pg||
nt|poky: but this isnt probably since East should remove it to 7@S|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Frank.. welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: WE can lost his @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Look at the @H contract compared the @S.|pg||
nt|poky: 2@H on 4th position is usually played as 10-14|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mr. Gamlemshaug looking at his @C?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|poky: without much thought|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud thin East wud insist on @S|pg||
nt|gsper:  Where 8 tricks should be easy and the 9th will probably come somehow.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Mr who??|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: North does have 3 extra spades, and his only side card in partner's suit. Tough not to bid 5@s here|pg||
nt|penseur9: I guess not |pg||
nt|chrisky: in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: what is the best lead here?|pg||
nt|chrisky: @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  ace of clubs, AK of hearts on which West shows a doubleton, heart ruffed high, spade finesse?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's not a solid suit, the 10 missing :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S seems to kill.|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
nt|gsper:  May lose 2@S, 1@H, 1@D and 1@C before the 9th comes in.|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes distink possibility|pg||
nt|gsper:  Easts @S honors are of no interest. Still slam on.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2!V to be seen as a underbid from S.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: @H lead @D underlead @H ruff is only 1 down so i don't understand either|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here we go.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Andree:) U are always at my @H|pg||

nt|rodal f: *2@C.|pg||
nt|runnerup: so ew stole this in 3 @h -meanwhile 4 @s sits |pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: *bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: makable now after same lead|pg||
nt|penseur9: this will give Terraneo team the lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: and won't finesse @H now either so may be a make|pg||
nt|sommer: ..S has exactly room for @HK + @DKQ, but...|pg||
nt|poky: maybe it would be nice to play 4NT as BW, after the strong 1@C opening|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lucked out....|pg||
nt|poky: and then bid 7@S, after asking for kings :)|pg||
nt|poky: (I'm talking about the other room)|pg||
nt|dimi: great grand slam with 29 hcp|pg||
nt|poky: Occam's razor = keep the things simple|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: A @H drop?|pg||
nt|chrisky: very good score in  closed room|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes it is|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharkey: No reason why Våge shudnt ask in 4 NT?|pg||
nt|penseur9: maybe be easier played by south|pg||
nt|gsper:  E may even dream of making this, but the @D distribution will kill that,|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gsper:  and 4@S would have been -1 or even -2, right?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr @S waited.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|finch:  ok, that was a bit of fantasy|pg||
nt|sommer: @C first|pg||
pc|c3|nt|poky: because it is a shame to play a very sophisticated relay and find only 6 on this board, I would say|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|chrisky: no after the Q@d diff  played the Q@h......|pg||
nt|penseur9: must establish @C or he will be down|pg||

nt|danilo1: looks like missunderstood 3@C bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|othered1: unless they play good-bad 4N, where 4N has to be bid to show it's a save . . . |pg||
nt|danilo1: I now it is not agreed, but .. West DID NOT Dble 4@C |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like everyone wants to play in @C|pg||

nt|vugraphzkf: no need|pg||
nt|othered1: Dpon|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Don't forget the 2@H call by north on a so-so hand.|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... 5@C by West would not surprise me .. as first .. let they Dble - than I bid 5@H :) .. but 5@C by South is more schock than surprise|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||

nt|rodal f: I see NS at a 5|pg||
nt|runnerup: not so easy now to find those 14 top tricks|pg||
mb|3C|nt|poky: 8-12|pg||
nt|gsper:  That was a big surprise to me. Surely it should not have made?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|poky: 5+@H|pg||
nt|dimi: and 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW has a good sac in 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: not typical bid by North|pg||
nt|gsper:  In 3NT declarer may have to guess between @S and @D finesses.|pg||
nt|runnerup: tx all-bad but makeable slam here -so 4 @h +2 maybe|pg||
mb|4N|nt|penseur9: this is the last board for this match... does anyone know when is the following one?|pg||
nt|poky: but probably they will lead a club|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new try?|pg||
mb|6D|nt|finch:  I was just thinking that East has a take-out double at matchpoints|pg||
nt|finch:  but that's quite aggressive at imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...he claimed 11 and it was accepted...|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jallerton: Pachtman does not like to pass|pg||
nt|poky: they are on good road to 6@D|pg||
nt|poky: knowing their aggressiveness|pg||
mb|7D|nt|poky: 2@C Gazzilli by Mestric|pg||
mb|7N|nt|sommer: ..E should (of course) rested on 4@HX|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you bid slam (40% or so) you'd better bid it in @S |pg||
nt|dimi: this would fail by one trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poky: big discipline on this one|pg||
nt|poky: which was a very unlucky choice|pg||
nt|poky: because 2@S by North is 2@S 4-7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stig's brother is married with a lady who is married with a milliarder. Those two brothers made some fun with him at his wedding.|pg||
nt|gsper:  At that stage, yes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  unfortunately NS can't see the full layout, or they would have doubled|pg||
nt|sharkey: Still has to find @HQ...|pg||
nt|poky: since Zoric knows Borevkovic shoves to slam with almost any non-minimum hand :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Was Souths pass really alerted?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -ns beaten here |pg||
nt|penseur9: yes they may have pushed them to it though|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ryskiel_: probably 2 down and 6 imps to Praha|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|othered1: These auctions can get rather complex|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT now and it will be tough for EW to bid the grand|pg||
nt|othered1: Just from the EW hands alone.   South will have something to say about it, however.  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|danilo1: may not be easy .. but .. should go ... 2@C-2@D-3@C (1 side stop)-3@D (which one)-3@S=@S-5N= really :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You dreaming Danilo. Did you really think South would pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2@H is terrible to be honest|pg||
nt|danilo1: honestly .. did not look at South hand Roland .. seen 7NTand - Blue Club problem :)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|Walddk2: Put some pressure on them and bid 4NT|pg||
nt|othered1: I've had some abysmal results with the 2@D relay response on hands with long major suits, the better the hand the worse the problem.  So we play new major forcing o ver 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is as boring as kissing one's sister. It leads to nothing|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will S give up here|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, Roland.  I'd rather not bid at all than bid all of 2@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: very very diffult 7 to find ... do they have time that East discocver both ... @SK and closed @C ?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|othered1: In classical Blue Team, 2@C openings show goodish suits, but not this good.|pg||
