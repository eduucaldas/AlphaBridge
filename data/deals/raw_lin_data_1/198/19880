nt|vugraphzkg: ...enjoy...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkey: i know the EW pair - assume they play natural - perhaps with transfers after 1@C opening|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: By East, not a pleasant spot|pg||

nt|rodal f: Quite a hard force by an 8er.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Shows spade support|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: NS on vrong table...|pg||

nt|rodal f: Eve for u two Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S pair not on the AJ Connector team|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@C = weak 2 or strong?|pg||

nt|gsper:  Hi.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: and Dean|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: hi all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|finch:  3NT is also hopeless on a heart lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyone might take a while in 4@c! after all, until you finish playing the hand you aren't down yet|pg||
nt|jallerton: the play in 3NT will be faster|pg||
nt|dimi: Hi Roland and Dean|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears the 2@C opening got EW too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  Shows the effect of pre-empting, it made West decide to force to game (quite reasonably)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...hii all...welcome back...|pg||
nt|dimi: hello Carl|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hii Dean, hii Roland, hii all...:)|pg||
nt|poky: NS is one of best croatian pairs and thay play a pretty sopisticated system full of 2way bids|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Dimitri & Dean|pg||
nt|poky: this one meant: w2@D or 20+|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|gsper:  6@C makes but is not a good contract.|pg||
nt|poky: NS are a young croatian pair. they play a fairly natural system with mini 1NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|finch:  and they end up in a hopeless contract in a combined 23-count|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|gsper:  Ty, Dean. Valuable info. Any about EW methods?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  E-W will gain two imps in this undignofied contract|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|poky: sorry, I do not know nothing about the austrian pair|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|gsper:  Franz Terraneo used to play Blue Team Club 30 years ago.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|finch:  they can call it a good save against 3H on a diamond lead|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s7|pg||
nt|henryb:  or against 4@h, which is cold double dummy on any lead|pg||

pc|s4|pc|cA|pc|s9|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|april7: 6@C will be made because @D suit behaves!|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, and cannot go wrong as on non @d lead @h bhaves too|pg||
mb|2D|nt|santyclz: @H break makes the @d situation moot.|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: no @D lead, it will be @S lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|danilo1: do not believe Sout will try slam |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Now we get the right pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...sry for a delay all...enjoy now....:)|pg||
nt|poky: a variant of the Blue Club system|pg||
nt|penseur9: I've been trying to reach the sight for overall results with partial success: http://www.crobridge.com/pula/eng/|pg||
nt|poky: 4@S that is hard to beat on this one|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sharkey: EW got off cheaply NV|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 NT now?|pg||
nt|poky: as you can see, NS are pretty aggressive bidders|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dimi: 3nt can be made i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkg: ...lead from wrong side...director called...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  That is a Very forcing NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dimi: 4@h fails by @s ruff|pg||
nt|poky: besides that, N is often very practical - he mostly bid what he thinks he could make|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: ...an doubles whatever he thinks can set :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|poky: well, maybe not so hard if N will be so brave to underlead hearts (after the natural @h lead) to get @C back|pg||
nt|poky: surely, he is capable of those moves|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Slam try from W.|pg||
nt|gsper:  5@H would have been a good sac IF 4@S makes.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|poky: lets see|pg||
nt|poky: good @H10|pg||
nt|poky: faking QT|pg||
nt|poky: very nice play by Terraneo|pg||
nt|poky: will this trap be enough?|pg||
nt|poky: well, to be honest, from 964 south would have lead the 4|pg||
nt|poky: since they lead 3/5, not MUD|pg||
nt|poky: Stankovic should get it right|pg||
nt|gsper:  But presumably 6 from 64|pg||
nt|poky: this is surely possible|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: 3 NT play better than 4@H I think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jallerton: it's either forcing or it isn't|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Ryszard|pg||
nt|gsper:  !|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: :)  Henry loves that debate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I had it with him the other day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I claim that thereis no such thing as semi-forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but most who play forcing NT do not include game forces in the bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either a bid is forcing or it is not|pg||
nt|finch:  semi-forcing NT is about as meaningful as grand slam force (which at least is forcing!)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bob Holl|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|poky: excellent play by Andrea!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jallerton: I disagree. If you don't include any game forces in your 1NT response then why play it as forcing?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By NT at the right hand...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ryskiel_: good evening - I m Ryszard Kielczewski from Poland|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not a great result for N-S|pg||
nt|finch:  admittedly not very likely, but an extra chance|pg||
nt|dimi: only, well i was the last 2 years in Pula and i think it was a littel bit warmer even in the night:)|pg||
nt|poky: 1@C with transfer responses here|pg||
nt|gsper:  Is Andrea male or female?|pg||
nt|poky: Male|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 7 than 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hii Roland, Bob an Povl and all kibs...welcome all....:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: double or 2@C now as west ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sharkey: Can they bid slam?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|poky: S hand is between 2@C/3@C/2@H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: we can saw Grzegorz Narkiewicz, silver medalist of European Championships from Ostend and bronze medalist in Open Pairs - Pozna 2011|pg||
nt|poky: even though Andrea is most often a female name, even here in Croatia|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch:  I think they must have had a bidding misunderstanding at the other table|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jallerton: likely to bid slam now that 2@c has been opened, one would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: X ok followed by 3@C ..as done|pg||
nt|poky: probably 2@C is the best bid, because it carries most flexibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  after a 2@C opening and a heart suit, North has a virtual slam force|pg||
nt|rodal f: An X to come from E?|pg||
nt|gsper:  None of the names here make the gender clear to a Scandiavian.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@H should set the suit and ask for a cuebid|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3nt is gone as it was after they supported each other in @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dimi: nasty 5:0 break in @d ... d! slam will be hard to make|pg||
nt|poky: but as I already told, they both like to bid it aggressively :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: North will have a problem showing the power of his @D suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: his partner Cezary Serek grow up as bridge player only few years ago bu climbed in his bridge skilfull|pg||
nt|penseur9: In French we have AndrÃ©= male and AndrÃ©e = female|pg||
nt|chrisky: hi to all  3@S is safe here|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Chris welcome|pg||
pc|hA|nt|finch:  the old-fashioned way to play is the 3@H asks for a first round control, responder bids 3NT with a king but no ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which it probably did|pg||
nt|jallerton: assuming 2@C was their strongest bid|pg||
pc|h6|nt|finch:  with that understanding 3@S showed the ace|pg||
nt|poky: strange bit, it should be stopper asking and not hidden suit showing|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|poky: but, to be honest, they like to be very creative in most undiscussed sequences :)|pg||
nt|poky: bit=bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps N shud have shown @D suit first - then bid @S twice...|pg||
nt|poky: this wasn't possible|pg||
nt|poky: because 1@S response is relayish, it doesn't show @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt 1@S show @D suit or NT?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|finch:  but with that understanding so did 5@C, so they may be cuebidding first or second|pg||
nt|finch:  redouble here will show first round club control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't he also bid 3NT with a singleton, Frances? Any second round control? I don't know Acol that well|pg||
nt|finch:  yes, sorry, 3NT with a second round control; cue with a first round control|pg||
nt|henryb:  As I played that, 3@s showed the @sA and no other ace. 4N would show two aces|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|poky: 1NT would have been invitational for the balanced range|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jallerton: In original Acol, you were supposed to make a positive on any hand with 2 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to AndrÃ© VallÃ©e|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hii :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: Hi Tomislav|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|poky: and 1@S is showing all the weak hands w/o 4M and some strong hands|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: possibly make 10 tricks - but both sides have his troubles|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|dimi: agressive X ... demands the @d lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont like Herland's x - might have saved NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: Though 6@D down on split|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poky: aggressive bidding with thin values and misfit in spades backfires|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5NT should show something extra but no further 2nd round control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to play, not so at the table|pg||
nt|bobholl: J would have been easier for P :)|pg||
nt|sommer: very lucky start for the young, nice ladies from Austria10 + 11 from "nowhere" (6@D was too hard)|pg||
nt|poky: 1@D opened here because 1NT would have been 9-12|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|poky: but it is only -1 since the @H lead didn't come|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - Herland asked for @S lead - dummy's first bid suit?|pg||
nt|poky: yeah|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, I thought I was in 7|pg||
nt|finch:  yes I think 6 isn't so hard|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suppose the right way to play this is @cA, @c ruff, @h, @c ruff, @d finesse|pg||
nt|finch:  not in 6 it isn't|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not?|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d ruff?|pg||
nt|finch:  the ace of diamonds might get ruffed off|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, making 7 is an imp|pg||
nt|henryb:  Once both opponents follow to three clubs and one heart, the probability of a stiff diamond becomes vanishingly small|pg||
nt|finch:  so you need it to be a smaller chance than 1 in 21 that there is a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Chris Hatzopoulos|pg||

nt|gsper:  According to a kib: EW very modified Acol, weak NT, 1,3,5.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|finch:  3-3 is probably sufficient to make it though|pg||
nt|jallerton: defending 2@sx would do instead|pg||

nt|sommer: 4@S is good sac and puts pressure on S|pg||

nt|poky: 3@S by north|pg||

mb|p|nt|sommer: quite obvious, tho|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9: 2@C should make if declarer figures out the trump distribution|pg||
nt|poky: aggressive raise to the game|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jallerton: @ha, duck a @h, lead towards K|pg||
nt|finch:  declarer can afford to play ace of hearts and duck a heart before playing towards the queen|pg||
nt|finch:  hearts are very likely to be 4-2 from 2@S bid selected by West|pg||
nt|poky: N opts to describe his hand|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes a little|pg||
pc|d7|nt|poky: which is strange|pg||
nt|poky: because 3@D is the right bit if he has 5-7 hcp without game ambitions|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - One table gamled on 7 - the other didnt find it...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...thx all...well come back in 5-10 mins...|pg||
nt|penseur9: very costly...12 IMPs for praha team|pg||
nt|chrisky: 6@H?|pg||
nt|poky: naah|pg||
nt|poky: 4M here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dimi: 5@c or 5@d for NS is on|pg||
nt|poky: probably 4@H|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes|pg||
nt|poky: which need a carefull play after the @DA lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|poky: Fantunes 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: 8-12|pg||
mb|1N|nt|poky: 5+@H|pg||
nt|dimi: and 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW has a good sac in 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: not typical bid by North|pg||
nt|gsper:  In 3NT declarer may have to guess between @S and @D finesses.|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: this is the last board for this match... does anyone know when is the following one?|pg||
nt|poky: but probably they will lead a club|pg||
mb|2C|nt|finch:  I was just thinking that East has a take-out double at matchpoints|pg||
nt|finch:  but that's quite aggressive at imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Pachtman does not like to pass|pg||
nt|poky: they are on good road to 6@D|pg||
nt|poky: knowing their aggressiveness|pg||
mb|2S|nt|poky: 2@C Gazzilli by Mestric|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..E should (of course) rested on 4@HX|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you bid slam (40% or so) you'd better bid it in @S |pg||
nt|dimi: this would fail by one trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poky: big discipline on this one|pg||
nt|poky: which was a very unlucky choice|pg||
nt|poky: because 2@S by North is 2@S 4-7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|finch:  unfortunately NS can't see the full layout, or they would have doubled|pg||
nt|sharkey: Still has to find @HQ...|pg||
nt|poky: since Zoric knows Borevkovic shoves to slam with almost any non-minimum hand :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ryskiel_: probably 2 down and 6 imps to Praha|pg||
nt|poky: pity|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobholl: RKC now and no slam :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|sommer: 2@H both MA .."N relais..3@S 6-4|pg||
nt|sommer: two cues, @DA denied, 4NT for aces|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sommer: %@H: no @SQ|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|penseur9: very|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sommer: 5@H..|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he knows it will be a 40% slam or so but bids it anyway  |pg||
nt|sommer: well done|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|poky: but he doesn't like at all singleton honors|pg||
nt|poky: as @SK on this one|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chrisky: i think the best play is AK@s and @D finesse|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobholl: disagree just lucky although the J of @S adds it up |pg||
nt|sommer: .."wd" ONLY BECAUSE IT MAKES:)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poky: but even if he bid 2@H, hardly Stankovic would have raised to 3@H|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|poky: he even insist his partner should bid he's hand as balanced, if he has some singleton K|pg||
nt|poky: he's=his|pg||
nt|sharkey: So the Jerkers will win this match|pg||
nt|dimi: well done, see ya!|pg||
nt|poky: it seems so|pg||
nt|poky: ty all|pg||
pc|s8|nt|finch:  another club towards dummy looks very effective at this point|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gsper:  But he had to make up his mind now,|pg||
nt|poky: not easy to find the game here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzkg: ---that was the last board...thx all...see you in 10 minutes or less---bye...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|bobholl: and a push :)|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@C is best..you have Extras for @H3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...will be back in 15-20 minutes...see ya...|pg||
nt|bobholl: tya cu later|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|finch:  said just too late!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzna: bad play..ginossar said sorry partner i need to make it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|poky: maybe south should've tried 3@H?|pg||
nt|poky: hard to tell|pg||
mc|10|nt|chrisky: now -1|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|penseur9: last hand here... |pg||
nt|poky: ty all|pg||
nt|penseur9: the schedule shows a 30 minutes break but I suspect they will be back sooner|pg||
nt|penseur9: Thanks Dean and Chris|pg||
nt|chrisky: ok|pg||
nt|penseur9: following the next round, there will be a lunch break for them|pg||

mb|3H|nt|vugraphzkf: try now :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|danilo1: too agressive bidding by South ... surprised North did not Dble 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: I don't think N can pass now with ace of @S and 4@H cards!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, lot of bidding, & not the way one would have expected|pg||

nt|santyclz: Clearly a singleton...|pg||
nt|april7: if E thinks to long, S might suspect a bad break and not continue @Hif E ducks|pg||
nt|april7: if ducks quickly S might continue playing trump|pg||
