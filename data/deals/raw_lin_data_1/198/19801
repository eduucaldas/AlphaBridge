nt|mathat: 3@s is 3 suit |pg||
nt|psyck: Results will be added here later: http://www.hellasbridge.org/apotelesmata/club/13|pg||
nt|athene: many specs are saying south should bid clubs second time rather than 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course, we can see it's better|pg||
nt|athene: but there are many hands north might have with, say, two hearts, where you score more in 4@H than 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: you can't bid 4@C to offer the choice because that isn't forcing|pg||
nt|athene: and you have way too much playing strength|pg||
nt|athene: even when partner has only one heart, 4@H will often be fine|pg||
