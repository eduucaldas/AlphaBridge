nt|Walddk2: 4@C is the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: yeah you know that good ah roland?:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: hope the weather is better in Pula than Norway|pg||

nt|penseur9: you're both welcomed :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  I understand NS play Blue Team Club, as good Austrians. How about EW?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...hii all...welcome back...good evening all...:)|pg||
nt|runnerup: some challence but 4 @h makes as cards are|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: i know the EW pair - assume they play natural - perhaps with transfers after 1@C opening|pg||
nt|penseur9: it seems we start where we left off... with a great bidding contest|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzkg: ...hii all...welcome---_)|pg||
nt|poky: hi all|pg||
mb|r|nt|Walddk2: By East, not a pleasant spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...welcome back all...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Tomi and Rodal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a hard force by an 8er.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...well...we have problems...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Shows spade support|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: NS on vrong table...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh right|pg||
nt|rodal f: Eve for u two Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S pair not on the AJ Connector team|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi again Tomislav|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: 2@C = weak 2 or strong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...this is second day of open teams in Pula....7th round...enjoy...|pg||
nt|gsper:  Tino, could be the new generation.|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Dean|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...hii all...welcome...|pg||
nt|runnerup: strange but ns has game |pg||
nt|rodal f: Quit a nice problem to see|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Dimi|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jallerton: perhaps they should have spent more time on the auction then|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...secont round of open teams just started...|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi.|pg||
nt|runnerup: this also|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: A fail at @H? don't belive it.|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Markku and Frank... welcome back|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: and Dean|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@D to come?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: hi all|pg||
mb|5D|nt|finch:  3NT is also hopeless on a heart lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyone might take a while in 4@c! after all, until you finish playing the hand you aren't down yet|pg||
nt|jallerton: the play in 3NT will be faster|pg||
nt|dimi: Hi Roland and Dean|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears the 2@C opening got EW too high here|pg||
nt|runnerup: north pays for him having a sidesuit this time |pg||
nt|penseur9: 5@D may be one to many here|pg||
nt|runnerup: lucky quess -some % chance and it is on|pg||
nt|penseur9: as you say Markku.. may be on|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 finesses and no @h looser so some %|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  Shows the effect of pre-empting, it made West decide to force to game (quite reasonably)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...hii all...welcome back...|pg||
nt|dimi: hello Carl|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hii Dean, hii Roland, hii all...:)|pg||
nt|poky: NS is one of best croatian pairs and thay play a pretty sopisticated system full of 2way bids|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Dimitri & Dean|pg||
nt|poky: this one meant: w2@D or 20+|pg||
nt|runnerup: south thought he is balanced 4-3-3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gsper:  6@C makes but is not a good contract.|pg||
nt|poky: NS are a young croatian pair. they play a fairly natural system with mini 1NT|pg||
nt|runnerup: clever switch |pg||
pc|sK|nt|finch:  and they end up in a hopeless contract in a combined 23-count|pg||
nt|penseur9: looks like 3@C will go down here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|gsper:  Ty, Dean. Valuable info. Any about EW methods?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|gsper:  To put it mildly.|pg||
nt|penseur9: :) I'm always a mild person :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  E-W will gain two imps in this undignofied contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|penseur9: I can appreciate Lindermann dilmna here|pg||
nt|runnerup: but declarer got it rigth|pg||
pc|d2|nt|poky: sorry, I do not know nothing about the austrian pair|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tomislav, specs and co commentators.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gsper:  Franz Terraneo used to play Blue Team Club 30 years ago.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|finch:  they can call it a good save against 3H on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|poky: good stop in 5@C, pity that whole @DKQ is on and slam could be made|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes great |pg||

nt|vugraphzkg: hii :)...welcome|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c8|pc|s3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|poky: I'm informed that EW probably play strong 1@C with canape openings (4carder majors)|pg||
pc|h7|mc|11|nt|henryb:  or against 4@h, which is cold double dummy on any lead|pg||
pg||

nt|danilo1: interesting board .. even more with 3@C by North|pg||
nt|athene: but if you haven't discussed it thoroughly they can just give you more room to get tangled up|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: you have double, cue, pass then double, double then double...etc etc|pg||
nt|athene: i think immediate double should be takeout of the suit since you might need to get in fast with that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly. Does double show clubs or is it a takeout of diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but any sensible method is ok|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|danilo1: does South really have any option (except calm 3@D) after East's Dble?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, yes, he has lots of options, such as 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess 3@D is reasonable|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2A are to much to thk about opponents  game|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk2: re Ed|pg||
nt|athene: if EW haven't discussed this then east has a problem now|pg||
nt|athene: if he bids 3@S, is that a second suit, having shown primary clubs with the double?|pg||
nt|danilo1: I prefer 3@D and - if need 4@D later - that tells partner that he has defensive values|pg||
nt|athene: or is it just showing a monster with spades, the first double being general strength?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: That's how I play this auction, but maybe not with this  hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: west does have t hose nice @C, but the @DK is likely not of value and there are n o  other redeeming features|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: There you go; West thinks double is generic takeout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have no agreement it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like west took double as takeout of |pg||
nt|othered1: @D|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: south might take a swing at this, i think|pg||
nt|athene: not likely to be making overtricks :)|pg||
nt|athene: and the bidding doesn't sound exactly brimming with confidence|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|othered1: do you think east sees 4@H as a forward-going cue-bid?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: huge board for NS in the other room|pg||
nt|danilo1: difficukt to find better bidding in EW - even if not sure agreed situation|pg||
nt|danilo1: I believe 4@C promissed 1 4M .. so 4@H nat|pg||

nt|vugraphzkg: ...this is oure first match of open teams...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should be a Polish pair NS here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u R. But are the hand good enough+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Other room OK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now we get the right pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...sry for a delay all...enjoy now....:)|pg||
nt|poky: a variant of the Blue Club system|pg||
nt|penseur9: I've been trying to reach the sight for overall results with partial success: http://www.crobridge.com/pula/eng/|pg||
nt|poky: 4@S that is hard to beat on this one|pg||
nt|gsper:  5@DX in other room, so it may have paid not to find @D.|pg||
nt|penseur9: good point|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sharkey: EW got off cheaply NV|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 NT now?|pg||
nt|poky: as you can see, NS are pretty aggressive bidders|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|dimi: 3nt can be made i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit strange nick at east. Will not tell what it mean in Norwegian. Better that he do down there.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzkg: ...lead from wrong side...director called...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Willl W overrule E.|pg||
nt|penseur9: who would jump to 4@S here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  That is a Very forcing NT|pg||
nt|gsper:  Though it is close to making now!|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: semiweak 2 @d -with 5 cards -so maybe shows opening hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: 4@h fails by @s ruff|pg||
nt|poky: besides that, N is often very practical - he mostly bid what he thinks he could make|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2@S should make here but with little to spare|pg||
nt|penseur9: wow... 5@D made in CR for 12 IMPs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|poky: ...an doubles whatever he thinks can set :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: on  1 I mean|pg||
pc|c5|nt|poky: well, maybe not so hard if N will be so brave to underlead hearts (after the natural @h lead) to get @C back|pg||
nt|poky: surely, he is capable of those moves|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: Slam try from W.|pg||
nt|gsper:  5@H would have been a good sac IF 4@S makes.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|runnerup: now at least ew knew what to lead and no chance this will be made|pg||
pc|h6|nt|poky: lets see|pg||
nt|poky: good @H10|pg||
nt|poky: faking QT|pg||
nt|poky: very nice play by Terraneo|pg||
nt|poky: will this trap be enough?|pg||
nt|poky: well, to be honest, from 964 south would have lead the 4|pg||
nt|poky: since they lead 3/5, not MUD|pg||
nt|poky: Stankovic should get it right|pg||
nt|gsper:  But presumably 6 from 64|pg||
nt|poky: this is surely possible|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: 3 NT play better than 4@H I think|pg||
nt|runnerup: overbid is the most obvious treat here,but west didnt believe in just rigth cards and rigth he was|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jallerton: it's either forcing or it isn't|pg||
nt|penseur9: to say that it does not looking good for Terraneo... would it be an understatement?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are ttih enogh for find them  bad enouhg?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Ryszard|pg||
nt|gsper:  !|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: W a well known player from Norway         and E better than his brother? |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: :)  Henry loves that debate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I had it with him the other day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I claim that thereis no such thing as semi-forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but most who play forcing NT do not include game forces in the bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either a bid is forcing or it is not|pg||
nt|finch:  semi-forcing NT is about as meaningful as grand slam force (which at least is forcing!)|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes just right|pg||
pc|s9|nt|runnerup: what is east thinking -really small -ok|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bob Holl|pg||
pc|c8|nt|poky: excellent play by Andrea!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jallerton: I disagree. If you don't include any game forces in your 1NT response then why play it as forcing?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By NT at the right hand...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: good evening - I m Ryszard Kielczewski from Poland|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dimi: Dean what is the temperature in Pula ?|pg||
nt|runnerup: some strange decisions in defence,but |pg||
pc|d5|nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|poky: as I predicted :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I asked Henry if a woman can be semi-pregnant. He did not reply. Either she is or she is not, period.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Nice to see u.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|finch:  Declarer has a difficult problem on the club back|pg||
nt|finch:  he might need the finesse for his 9th trick, but if the majors come in and East has the @CK he's just off by finessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: yeah but no diffrent which card to play here:) lucky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Forcing 1N was originally used to allow invitational hands to bid 1N rather than at the two level, and facilitate 2/1 gf|pg||
nt|finch:  I wonder what declarer can infer from West winning the first spade with the queen and the second with the 10|pg||
nt|finch:  what holdings would do that?|pg||
nt|jallerton: KQ10 and KQ104|pg||
nt|finch:  or as has just be suggested to me, someone with the @CK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think if E had the @ck he would have returned the @d2|pg||
nt|finch:  there are plenty of positions where you just don't bother given suit preference without an ace|pg||
nt|finch:  and this is one of them|pg||
nt|jallerton: @s 3-3 seems more likely than @s4-2 with both rounded suits coming in|pg||
nt|finch:  why would East want to help declarer by showing whether or not he has the @CK?|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: stil thinking|pg||
nt|rodal f: @SK and a @C?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|sommer: hello:)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|poky: but during the day it is much warmer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: In CR South passed and bid a careful 3@H over pd's 2 NT - different styles like you mentioned Dean|pg||

mc|7|pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4ST96HJ986DQ765CA7,SK72HK43DKJ842C43,SA8543HQ52DACQT85,SQJHAT7DT93CKJ962|sv|n|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|athene: NS likely to get this one in 2@S whether west opens or not, you would think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S better than double with 5-3 in the majors|pg||
mb|r|nt|danilo1: 1@D is 2+ cards @D, no 4M|pg||
nt|athene: not sure about that double though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: south's pass is interesting too|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@S all pass?|pg||
nt|athene: with rubbish but preference for hearts he should surely bid 1@H there|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps he thinks by passing first and then introducing hearts (or notrumps) he can show a fair hand|pg||
nt|othered1: east is a passed hand, so 2@C might imply @D fit for the redouble|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@H was a MUST for South, agree|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: well, with that shape but no HCP, most would bid 1@H, yes|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe he thinks he is too GOOD for 1@H directly over the redouble|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: of course his subsequent inaction suggests otherwise|pg||
nt|othered1: south obviously did  not come to bid|pg||
nt|athene: this is why 1@S works better than the double|pg||
nt|athene: you lose that fifth spade|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S over 1@D i mean|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: south could double 2@C if that's takeout; or bid 2@H maybe? i think he just allowed the redouble to scare him off|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: but to be fair he didn't think his side had any fit|pg||
nt|athene: he felt north was just scrambling, so maybe 4-3-2-4 or something like that|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: of course north could have four hearts for the double of 1@D, but then the way it went, it sounded as though he didn't, when he bypassed them to bid 1@S|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|hT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|danilo1: info sais that they play transfers also on Rdble ... (does not say if pass is @H) - so he could not bid 1@H|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|athene: south's bids over the redouble are transfers? that is a bit mad i think|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can pass show hearts? What if he does not have them?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what is he supposed to bid with 3343?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: well, i guess NS decide that he is stuck with that hand if it goes (1@D) X (pass)|pg||
nt|athene: so he isn't MORE stuck|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not ask me .. I play natural ... but I am also sure that INFO is rite :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: but you might as well use the redouble to allow you to scramble more efficiently surely|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: and transfers don't do that|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|c8|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not a great result for N-S|pg||
nt|finch:  admittedly not very likely, but an extra chance|pg||
nt|dimi: only, well i was the last 2 years in Pula and i think it was a littel bit warmer even in the night:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9: these are goulash hands :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes a like --here 3nt ew ,but can they come in|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: Can they bid slam?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @s only -1|pg||
nt|penseur9: not easy unless 2NT by east shows 5-5 in minors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are NS to win this?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|poky: S hand is between 2@C/3@C/2@H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: we can saw Grzegorz Narkiewicz, silver medalist of European Championships from Ostend and bronze medalist in Open Pairs - Pozna 2011|pg||
nt|poky: even though Andrea is most often a female name, even here in Croatia|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  I think they must have had a bidding misunderstanding at the other table|pg||
nt|rodal f: If precission 2@C are ok. But some might love a 3@C opening for pressure.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jallerton: likely to bid slam now that 2@c has been opened, one would think|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes -2 overruff |pg||
nt|rodal f: Well done by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: X ok followed by 3@C ..as done|pg||
nt|poky: probably 2@C is the best bid, because it carries most flexibility|pg||
nt|gsper:  This should not make I believe, but things happen.|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like -50 .meanwhile @s is -140 ,but not so easy to come in|pg||
nt|penseur9: NS certainly like to open light but may pay off here|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  after a 2@C opening and a heart suit, North has a virtual slam force|pg||
nt|rodal f: An X to come from E?|pg||
nt|gsper:  None of the names here make the gender clear to a Scandiavian.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@H should set the suit and ask for a cuebid|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3nt is gone as it was after they supported each other in @H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dimi: nasty 5:0 break in @d ... d! slam will be hard to make|pg||
nt|poky: but as I already told, they both like to bid it aggressively :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: North will have a problem showing the power of his @D suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: his partner Cezary Serek grow up as bridge player only few years ago bu climbed in his bridge skilfull|pg||
nt|penseur9: In French we have André= male and Andrée = female|pg||
nt|chrisky: hi to all  3@S is safe here|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Chris welcome|pg||
nt|penseur9: ho ho|pg||
pc|h2|nt|finch:  the old-fashioned way to play is the 3@H asks for a first round control, responder bids 3NT with a king but no ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which it probably did|pg||
nt|jallerton: assuming 2@C was their strongest bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: But N will not give up.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|finch:  with that understanding 3@S showed the ace|pg||
nt|poky: strange bit, it should be stopper asking and not hidden suit showing|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|poky: but, to be honest, they like to be very creative in most undiscussed sequences :)|pg||
nt|poky: bit=bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps N shud have shown @D suit first - then bid @S twice...|pg||
nt|poky: this wasn't possible|pg||
nt|poky: because 1@S response is relayish, it doesn't show @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt 1@S show @D suit or NT?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|finch:  but with that understanding so did 5@C, so they may be cuebidding first or second|pg||
nt|finch:  redouble here will show first round club control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't he also bid 3NT with a singleton, Frances? Any second round control? I don't know Acol that well|pg||
nt|finch:  yes, sorry, 3NT with a second round control; cue with a first round control|pg||
nt|henryb:  As I played that, 3@s showed the @sA and no other ace. 4N would show two aces|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|poky: 1NT would have been invitational for the balanced range|pg||
nt|runnerup: Lindermann took his view and wrong this time|pg||
nt|penseur9: one @D too many|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jallerton: In original Acol, you were supposed to make a positive on any hand with 2 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to André Vallée|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hii :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: Hi Tomislav|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|poky: and 1@S is showing all the weak hands w/o 4M and some strong hands|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: possibly make 10 tricks - but both sides have his troubles|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gsper:  So N passed 3d hand, at favourable in other room. Some people just don't do that at all.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was that last @D by any|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dimi: agressive X ... demands the @d lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont like Herland's x - might have saved NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: Though 6@D down on split|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes should have had 10 @h -not only 9 --reary such suit appears|pg||
pc|s7|nt|poky: aggressive bidding with thin values and misfit in spades backfires|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5NT should show something extra but no further 2nd round control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to play, not so at the table|pg||
nt|bobholl: J would have been easier for P :)|pg||
nt|sommer: very lucky start for the young, nice ladies from Austria10 + 11 from "nowhere" (6@D was too hard)|pg||
nt|poky: 1@D opened here because 1NT would have been 9-12|pg||
mc|10|nt|runnerup: east bravely bid 3 @d and that helped ,is he going to bid twice -ok nicely no -so 630 -4@s only 500,but guessed bidding already so no chance to that|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|othered1: south has a very normal-looking weak 2 in @H, if available.  And he does, 2@D looks to be multi, promising a major in most cases|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe you can make 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes 3nt ok as the majors lie, you have time to set up the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can because West has @S10|pg||
nt|othered1: better than maybe|pg||
mb|d|nt|danilo1: if East bids now, thk 3NT by West next|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: thk East should bid 3@H now|pg||
nt|othered1: and now, with east's h and?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stuck|pg||
nt|athene: tricky...east might go for 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|othered1: East will t hink par;tner is likely @S-oriented.|pg||
nt|othered1: Really, methods control east's action here.  2N could be many things, etc.|pg||
nt|athene: west hasn't really got anything like the hand his partner expects|pg||
nt|athene: well, i doubt he has anyway|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|danilo1: he had to show strenght .. and 3@H only option .. but .. should he pass 3NT thanß|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if they have some way of showing a pure t/o double of either major directly over 2@D, then the delayed double is either light or else this sort of weak notrump hand i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4nt keeps things simple|pg||
nt|danilo1: actually .. I thk much better bid by Bepo (West) would be 2NT than Dble|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but they have broken a lesser-known Burn's Law|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: "find out how many aces are held by opps, take it away from 8, and don't bid at that level"|pg||
nt|othered1: I laike east's judgment here, even if it wasn't a winner.|pg||
nt|athene: many people in england use the immediate double of 2@D to show exactly that sort of weakish balanced hand that west has|pg||
nt|athene: that would give them more chance of finding 3nt of course|pg||
nt|othered1: I use it to show a strongish balanced hand, with many partners.|pg||
nt|danilo1: lot depends on whish abgeement they have .. what Dble on 2@D means|pg||
nt|athene: although it might mean you are forced to pass 2@d with a t/o double of a major, which might be too high a price to pay if opps can pre-empt|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|danilo1: judgement hand in South ... after 1@H opening, thk obvious to force slam |pg||

mb|3S!|mb|4S|nt|athene: easy to see how slam or a grand slam might depend on not getting a diamond lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: I would rather bid just 3@C (if forcing - to start with) ... on both- 3@S or 4@C, 4@S is probable bid by West ... but than 3@C gives better info|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: since 5@C forced to 5@H, i don't think 5@D should show any extras|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north just feels he is subminimum so he is not going to offer any encouragement at all|pg||
nt|danilo1: after he Dbled 4@D, thk he had to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: and if partner only needs a diamond control and is now worried opps have @DAK, that is too bad|pg||
nt|danilo1: *Dbled 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that north might also be worried that if he bids 5@D his partner might think it's the ace|pg||

nt|poky: 1NT 9-12|pg||
mb|3H|nt|finch:  would have been, rather|pg||
nt|rodal f: One round force by 1NT|pg||
nt|gsper:  More or less:)|pg||
nt|runnerup: can ns find @h -3 @d would have been better .now yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  this auction is typically used to show a hand too good to overcall 2NT the first round|pg||
nt|poky: X showing the strong balaced variant|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud be -800...|pg||
nt|poky: 3@S by north|pg||
nt|poky: probably|pg||
nt|poky: and 3NT|pg||
nt|poky: or pass by N|pg||
nt|poky: the problem is, South can be 2344|pg||
nt|rodal f: E feelt bad by his opening?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Shall we guess 7 tricks?|pg||
nt|gsper:  3@S, 1@D and 3@C, though one more could easily happen.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I did not notice that EW use 4 card major. So 1NT was not force.|pg||
nt|penseur9: usually with 4 card support and 6-9 points... should he bid 3@H instead of two?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gsper:  W pass in 3d hand a little surprising, but there have been no suitable bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: quite obvious, tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  I woud rather have expected D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: 2@C should make if declarer figures out the trump distribution|pg||
nt|poky: aggressive raise to the game|pg||
nt|penseur9: the dealer has been doing a great job with many chalangeing hands|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jallerton: @ha, duck a @h, lead towards K|pg||
nt|finch:  declarer can afford to play ace of hearts and duck a heart before playing towards the queen|pg||
nt|finch:  hearts are very likely to be 4-2 from 2@S bid selected by West|pg||
nt|poky: N opts to describe his hand|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes a little|pg||
pc|c2|nt|poky: which is strange|pg||
nt|poky: because 3@D is the right bit if he has 5-7 hcp without game ambitions|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cud even have gone for -1100 - Herland got away with one|pg||
nt|poky: but as I said, they like creative solutions|pg||
pc|c4|nt|poky: especially when they know they'll blast any 3NT that has the chace of making 30% or more :)|pg||
nt|poky: very hard to understand the 3@H from south|pg||
nt|gsper:  I believe 5-card @S and 4-card @H is standard in Norway?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|poky: chaNce|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did N have for that bid? A was saaid.|pg||
nt|poky: where he could pass 3@Dx|pg||
nt|poky: since N has at least good invitational values|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|sommer: the only entrance must be used for @CQ|pg||
nt|bobholl: you don't feel pretty but you have to|pg||
nt|sharkey: Meckwell style bridge sounds like|pg||
nt|poky: yep|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes seems quite selfish to deside what to play when you have 4-4-4-1 |pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodal f: Tkx for ure signal "tomtegubbe":)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|poky: which means 12+ points|pg||
nt|poky: most often|pg||
nt|chrisky: yes 3@D goes -1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|gsper:  And I would have led a trump automatically.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|gsper:  There is no translation that brings out the flavour of "tomtegubbe":)|pg||

nt|gsper:  If he ruffs a heart, trump guess may not be needed.|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Herland went out of his way to bid the @S suit and Våge wudnt even lead it :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gsper:  Since the 2@C bid was a bit eccentric, it is difficult for E to know what S has.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzkg: ...director at the table...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: Not unbelivable that EW play "BIN-standard" as there system. A norwegian system builded up by 4 card opening. Let us see.|pg||

nt|vugraphzna: small break here|pg||
nt|jallerton: Blame whoever invented the "law" of total tricks|pg||
nt|poky: and I'm told they are on good road to 7NT|pg||
nt|dimi: 7NT for E-W|pg||
nt|poky: the only problem is, they cannot show 8carder suits|pg||
nt|poky: only 7+ carder|pg||
nt|sharkey: Namyats wud be effective here - showing solid Major|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt for ns|pg||
nt|gsper:  -1. Could declarer have handled his communications better?|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new discusion EW?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|poky: W opens the bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: that makes a difference....|pg||
mb|2D|nt|poky: hardly anyone plays 1@H-4@D as Namyats for spades :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some hopefully learnd a bit now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some slam to see now.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|runnerup: you migth loose entry to your hand in 4 @s here -if bidden|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  South has plenty of ways to show a strong spade raise here, so 3@S is a nice semi-preemptive call|pg||
nt|penseur9: will they go higher though?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C as semi @H?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bobholl: n derves a 4@H bid now :(|pg||
nt|sommer: inventive 1NT, but how did 4@S go 2 down??|pg||
nt|bobholl: deserves|pg||
nt|sharkey: havent seen that recently....:)|pg||
nt|poky: maybe someone will find the unlucky 7@H?|pg||
nt|rodal f: *@D|pg||
nt|runnerup: nicely found slam in other table|pg||
nt|runnerup: interesting 6 @s -makes but can you bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  North still has much the same problem, with 7 of the things|pg||
nt|poky: but this isnt probably since East should remove it to 7@S|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Frank.. welcome|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ryskiel_: WE can lost his @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Look at the @H contract compared the @S.|pg||
nt|poky: 2@H on 4th position is usually played as 10-14|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mr. Gamlemshaug looking at his @C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: without much thought|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud thin East wud insist on @S|pg||
nt|gsper:  Where 8 tricks should be easy and the 9th will probably come somehow.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Mr who??|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jallerton: North does have 3 extra spades, and his only side card in partner's suit. Tough not to bid 5@s here|pg||
nt|penseur9: I guess not |pg||
nt|chrisky: in @C|pg||
mb|d|nt|penseur9: what is the best lead here?|pg||
nt|chrisky: @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  ace of clubs, AK of hearts on which West shows a doubleton, heart ruffed high, spade finesse?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's not a solid suit, the 10 missing :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S seems to kill.|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
nt|gsper:  May lose 2@S, 1@H, 1@D and 1@C before the 9th comes in.|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes distink possibility|pg||
nt|gsper:  Easts @S honors are of no interest. Still slam on.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2!V to be seen as a underbid from S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: @H lead @D underlead @H ruff is only 1 down so i don't understand either|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here we go.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Andree:) U are always at my @H|pg||
mb|r|nt|sharkey: picky - picky Roland....|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: E:) Stig Gamlemshaug.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|poky: well|pg||
nt|penseur9: tks :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: east didnt think he can support west |pg||
nt|rodal f: Feel that E had an other did here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *2@C.|pg||
nt|runnerup: so ew stole this in 3 @h -meanwhile 4 @s sits |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sommer: makable now after same lead|pg||
nt|penseur9: this will give Terraneo team the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: and won't finesse @H now either so may be a make|pg||
nt|sommer: ..S has exactly room for @HK + @DKQ, but...|pg||
nt|poky: maybe it would be nice to play 4NT as BW, after the strong 1@C opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Lucked out....|pg||
nt|poky: and then bid 7@S, after asking for kings :)|pg||
nt|poky: (I'm talking about the other room)|pg||
nt|dimi: great grand slam with 29 hcp|pg||
nt|poky: Occam's razor = keep the things simple|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A @H drop?|pg||
nt|chrisky: very good score in  closed room|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes it is|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: No reason why Våge shudnt ask in 4 NT?|pg||
nt|penseur9: maybe be easier played by south|pg||
nt|gsper:  E may even dream of making this, but the @D distribution will kill that,|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns lost also this change|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gsper:  and 4@S would have been -1 or even -2, right?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Sr @S waited.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|finch:  ok, that was a bit of fantasy|pg||
nt|sommer: @C first|pg||

nt|runnerup: not so easy now to find those 14 top tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: 8-12|pg||
nt|gsper:  That was a big surprise to me. Surely it should not have made?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: 5+@H|pg||
nt|dimi: and 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW has a good sac in 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: not typical bid by North|pg||
nt|gsper:  In 3NT declarer may have to guess between @S and @D finesses.|pg||
nt|runnerup: tx all-bad but makeable slam here -so 4 @h +2 maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: this is the last board for this match... does anyone know when is the following one?|pg||
nt|poky: but probably they will lead a club|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new try?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|finch:  I was just thinking that East has a take-out double at matchpoints|pg||
nt|finch:  but that's quite aggressive at imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: ...he claimed 11 and it was accepted...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jallerton: Pachtman does not like to pass|pg||
nt|poky: they are on good road to 6@D|pg||
nt|poky: knowing their aggressiveness|pg||
pc|hK|nt|poky: 2@C Gazzilli by Mestric|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sommer: ..E should (of course) rested on 4@HX|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you bid slam (40% or so) you'd better bid it in @S |pg||
nt|dimi: this would fail by one trick|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|poky: big discipline on this one|pg||
nt|poky: which was a very unlucky choice|pg||
nt|poky: because 2@S by North is 2@S 4-7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stig's brother is married with a lady who is married with a milliarder. Those two brothers made some fun with him at his wedding.|pg||
nt|gsper:  At that stage, yes.|pg||
nt|penseur9: bye|pg||
pc|d2|nt|finch:  unfortunately NS can't see the full layout, or they would have doubled|pg||
nt|sharkey: Still has to find @HQ...|pg||
nt|poky: since Zoric knows Borevkovic shoves to slam with almost any non-minimum hand :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Was Souths pass really alerted?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -ns beaten here |pg||
nt|penseur9: yes they may have pushed them to it though|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|poky: but he doesn't like at all singleton honors|pg||
