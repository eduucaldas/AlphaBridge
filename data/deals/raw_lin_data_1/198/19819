nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are right Joao|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: a bit cloudy in London today |pg||
nt|jfaria:  could well be a transfer, just guessing :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jfaria:  with 4 loosers hard to guess a happy ending|pg||
nt|jfaria:  same result both rooms i think|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|bg: good spot for first board s/b 110|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  and margin is 13 VP till 2nd placed team|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the T can be costy...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I would play 2@c to show A@d rather than 10@c because of danger of discarding @d's|pg||
nt|jfaria:  must play a @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but they might have diffrent signals|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @S|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  plain board for a start|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bg: good contract the old moysian fit:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  though, without N's bid, EW may well land into 3NT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  comfortable standing|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bg: I guess systemically that N could not bid 3 spades over 3 hearts|pg||
nt|kjadams: Perfect fit here. |pg||
pc|d6|nt|bg: S playing for  a club honor onside this isnt going to work|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this start, S can rely on double finess in @c, but it doesn't work, unfortunately|pg||
nt|bg: W worried about possible but improbable 5 card trump stack may now switch to dia and let them ruff|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|vugraphznr: not sure what Artu's plan is now|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  discarding 2 @d now is easy|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bg: the spade 9 would control a heart return|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 rounds of @d could have following by 2 rounds of @c - just to become sure neither defernder has 5 spades|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all, bid and made - that matters|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  luckily. @s J is second|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  otherwise, finess is necessary now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: and @s was thrown away by N|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  and 4 more tricks for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Janet played 2-5-6 hearts showing no @d values but it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bg: but bidding 3 spades to me is better than a pass even if it showed 4 spades|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|kemperg: Or areplaying board 39 and 40|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|kemperg: no comparison now|pg||
nt|bg: 2nd hand should also be +110:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  they started from 39, indeed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  looks like partscore battle, especially after W's bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  @s game for NS, no more|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: we playing 31 to 40 in this round|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  nice bid opposite passed partner - NS are out of bidding|pg||
nt|bg: this should make lose 3 hearts dia and a spade|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  supposingly, 1@h bid was for spades|pg||
nt|kjadams: really aggressive 3N.   This is not going to do well.|pg||
nt|bg: NS destined to fail no matter where they end up|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sfoxa:  20 to 20 points - Roland's favourite hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but now Janet may have trouble with bidding her hand, i suppose|pg||
nt|jfaria:  micro st by E|pg||
nt|jfaria:  stolling many @c contract to NS|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hm. not impossible|pg||
nt|bg: aggressive|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  I'd like to know the reason not to bid @s with W hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes, it was transfer|pg||
nt|jfaria:  or even a @h game|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, landed safely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S woke up in time :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:  I wonder, which card E chooses for return |pg||
pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  oh, I anticipated @c|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  yes, defenders have no chance to @c trick |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C start needed|pg||
nt|kjadams: seems that with misfit, going low can win, and 2H likely to make.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|bg: I agree 2 H by N enough if South has a bigger Michaels then he will bid again|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kjadams: Good partner returning my suit!|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bg: E doesnt know that N has only one spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but @s switch seems to be safe|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after @s discard from dummy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bg: good switch now we will see if EW on same wavelenght as to count|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  admit, this time the lay of the cards isn't pretty good for EW, but playing 2@s seems good|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bg: W duck one dia continue club Q no play|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s7|nt|kemperg: in other systems W could do 2 @S, 4-8, 6crd|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C must have been gameforcing|pg||
nt|kjadams: now the hard part.  playing partner for club Q not so easy.   maybe since partner did not pitch one?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E has to find return now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bg: wrong play now 2 clubs makes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bg: had to kill dummy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, spade return could have been better|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now will play for dropping 10@c I think|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  good play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now @h ruff and @c ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: would you have bid 3@H? not me|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bg: I agree with you Sveta I do not understand why many players will bid 1nt after 1 heart instead of 1 spade|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 4-3-3-3 split - quite OK, but this time...|pg||
nt|bg: just lead club to J and lead dia J|pg||
nt|kemperg: would have been interesting here:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may overruf, but has to play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jfaria:  very brave i guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: not me|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kemperg: no defense any more|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  I should consider this approach - positive bid having an ace in hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bg: silly defense|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sJ|pc|d8|nt|kemperg: just collect AK of @H|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|sfoxa:  not obvious line at the table|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kemperg: any grand is on for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  huge hand for EW|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S's tiny opening allows EW staying low, I hope|pg||
nt|kemperg: but 6 is normal bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but they have to discover their might|pg||
nt|kemperg: Very distracting to hear Roland talking:):)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kemperg: modern bidding by EW, 2@D as switch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now 4@s bid looks like obligatory|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S had been @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W should find reasons to continue the bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: how do you find @SK is missing?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  no way - it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: Open room North bid 3S directly on bd 21|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|kemperg: N on the brink of an invite|pg||
nt|kemperg: I couldn't|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - grand relied of a finess of trump K - isn't the good one|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl lokking for a better suit then @H?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  or the team match pressure worked? it seems so|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @S finesse now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after this lead he will play spades from top|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and after this start, @sK is going to take the trick - declarer may be afraid of @d ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bg: then S misplayed only made 5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bg: good decision by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hot start|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H competitive, dbl = invite|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bg: aggressive E might have been better off trying 2 dia instead of 2 hearts showing 10 points or so sure spade support is weak but the alternative of 2 Hearts led them too high|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, even 2 tricks in @s for NS become problematic|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree - distribution encourages|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N just does not believe...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|sfoxa:  yes, W could be hardly blamed for his 3@h bid - E may well have an ace more|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  EW have easy 3NT, but this juicy defence brings more |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|bg: E should balance I think usually bad result to let opps play 1h-2h|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h7|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphznr: what would be 3@d instead of 3@h ? isnt like better /weak support with heart fit ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this agreement suits well to the situation|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and a lot of pairs playing opps suit as maximum (passed or bid) hand with fit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|bg: good thought but depends on partnership understanding Engine and caboose have to be on same track|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, this time 7 tricks are in view - not bad|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@h must be @h and... with 11 cards and @h fit W decided to take a chance|pg||
nt|jfaria:  this may proove expensive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a swing as expected on B 1|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c3|nt|jfaria:  but B2 may even scores|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  and one can count of defenreds' omission|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h9|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  5@c seems safe|pg||
nt|bg: have to be careful in heart slam a finesse would be fatal|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  with N as declarer, contract is safe|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  same for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sfoxa:  what would you lead with W hand after such an auction?|pg||
nt|kemperg: W almost endplayed now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: @C for me|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @s for me - both of no use this time|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d looks as the same pain|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4 diamonds, 4 hearts, 1 club 1 spade..  Needs two club ruffs, but the overruff is a problem.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kemperg: no, dnl for me|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: btw 2@s was a good decision, may would bid simply 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: many*|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sfoxa:  @s game looks not worse, actually|pg||
nt|kemperg: same start in OR, but S rebid 2 @S , @D was not mentioned|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: here 2@s would be 6+@s, thats what N explained|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: we can see that Rabbi's rule works (when the stiff king offside, Drop it), but at the table, I'd probably go down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  12 imps gain on B2, again as expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: Let's say he starts with ace and a club...  after the over ruff, still has to guess hearts.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  and this line may well reduce declarer's tricks with 9 only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may clear @d now|pg||
nt|bg: this line guards against a heart switch but turns out ok since W has club ace|pg||
nt|bg: right if he drops king then slam makes|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's good bid opposite passed partner - when no game is in view|pg||

pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  another way possible - now W waits with @d and @cQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bg: yes 4 hearts depends on club guess|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: some discussion at the table about  prev board but dont know Bulgarian :/|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  still no push :) what a final match!|pg||
nt|jfaria:  to loose just 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: well done at both tables|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  they are fast - 7 boards in half-an-hour and little bit more|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|kemperg: very fast|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  special challenge for the operator :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I've done more challenging ones :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: another 8 suit|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|kjadams: Many pairs play transfer advances of partners major after a negative double.  |pg||
mb|3H|nt|kjadams: where transfer to opps suit = limit raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: here is a great slam make 7 double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  @h fit is discovered, but right contract is NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  fine boards for the last match, when swings are necessary )))|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: other table 4hxx ... in prev , now playing|pg||
nt|bg: 2 D should be about a 10 point raise N should bid 2 spades and thats it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kemperg: do the Romanians have Bulgarian?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS are from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeh, but their opps not|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: if -1 no bid deal :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: hmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  from one hand, 5@d is a good save, from another - you may well force your opps to go higher|pg||
nt|kjadams: transfer to our suit = constructive raise, and bidding our suit is garbage.|pg||
nt|bg: not sure what 2 H meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 1 down at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Herman team got hard stroke in  1, when EW next door bid and went down in 3NT, but now, imp by imp, they gain the lead|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2H should be a last train type of game try in case 2D stronger than limit.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  after @dQ falls, only @h finess is necessary|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  obvious 3NT, but after informative bidding|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jfaria:  same ten tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  normal line of play in @h brings 9th trick|pg||

pc|d7|nt|kjadams: Seems to me that east was worth a direct 2S Q|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a no swing board? :)|pg||
nt|bg: all lines of play work here but declarer not sure of any of them|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphznr: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: will it be @s switch now ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  any other chance for defence?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kemperg: OR finished, here 2 boards in the last 20 mins|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|nt|vugraphznr: Gustwasson is not happy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this line keeps open all the options|pg||
nt|bg: that is a good play test clubs before hearts|pg||
nt|bg: rewarded with over trick|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Bjornlund just claimed 9 tricks|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|patricck: Just needs either the @D finesse or the @S break to make 12 tricks. Neither works|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: Bessis team was sold on auction for 3800 GBP|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  good fits - no game|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jfaria:  now @h vs @s duel 4 sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: another not unreasonable slam that will fail on distribution|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sfoxa:  is it the top amount?|pg||
nt|bg: I can imagine  spade break un lucky but no need to cash spade king|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: and this was the top amount|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and how does the standing look like, actually?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, EW prevented opps from @h game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tiny, but game|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: lead of @C 9 what was the system on that?|pg||
nt|kemperg: all pass|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphznr: 2@c Precision style|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  EW next door manage to bid this slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what about this pair?|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont see the 1 up|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sfoxa:  and vul. sacrifice that works |pg||
nt|jfaria:  W is looking at colours remebering B3|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: vuln. save:)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but this time he guessed ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: good board for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d start is necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after @s lead 5@h should make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting choice|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sfoxa:  with the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Gustawsson was sold for 500|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: do not like 2nt rebid 2 dia reverse then raise hearts better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  only when defence goes asleep|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 2@s was corrected to 3|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: so should jump a@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: overall pool money are 22.500 gbp|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  kind of gadget could be usefull for EW, showing 6 cards suit and not minimum hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: lost of comment by specs, nice:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots:(|pg||
nt|kemperg: S had a pass on 2 @D so N knows they are high enough|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  and cash @d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I meant 3NT by S - rather demonstrating @s stopper|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|kemperg: 2@S of W said if you have @H then bid else pass|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  looks like NS are on their way to @c  slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  grand???|pg||
nt|bg: now they cannot know about club queen they may bid 7 and get lucky|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky indeed - no possibility to get wrong|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphznr: 1. Gustawsson - 3800, 2. Ventin - 3500 3. Herman - 2400 |pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 4. Widoger - 2100, 5. De Botton - 1600, 6. Garvey - 1400|pg||
nt|kjadams: should lose 1S 1D.  next.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphznr: there are many imps in this round in both ways|pg||
nt|kemperg: @SK now?|pg||
nt|kemperg: entrys are a big problem here|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont see more then 8 tricks max.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  each line of play choosen by declarer, leads to one down, unfortunately |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if defence makes no mistake|pg||
nt|bg: this will tighten up the match|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  OR bid uncontested and used a lot of relays|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|sfoxa:  overall results (by groups) are to be found here http://www.tgrsbridge.com/|pg||

pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  great job Jacek!|pg||

nt|kjadams: best defense can set this.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in OR, E opened his hand and went down 2 in 2 @s, here E was more carefully|pg||
nt|kemperg: so far so good|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|bg: N could use 3 spades as minor suit interest but this pair may not have that in their system South would accept such a bid since a majority of his points are in the minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  particulary for this hand - very useful agreement|pg||
nt|bg: W needs a heart shift after two spades ducked|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
