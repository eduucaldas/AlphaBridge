nt|vugraphzkg: ...this is oure first match of open teams...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should be a Polish pair NS here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u R. But are the hand good enough+|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Now we get the right pair|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sharkey: EW got off cheaply NV|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 NT now?|pg||
nt|poky: as you can see, NS are pretty aggressive bidders|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|dimi: 3nt can be made i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkg: ...lead from wrong side...director called...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  That is a Very forcing NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dimi: 4@h fails by @s ruff|pg||
nt|poky: besides that, N is often very practical - he mostly bid what he thinks he could make|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: ...an doubles whatever he thinks can set :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Slam try from W.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: 3 NT play better than 4@H I think|pg||

nt|jallerton: it's either forcing or it isn't|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Ryszard|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: :)  Henry loves that debate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I had it with him the other day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I claim that thereis no such thing as semi-forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but most who play forcing NT do not include game forces in the bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either a bid is forcing or it is not|pg||
nt|finch:  semi-forcing NT is about as meaningful as grand slam force (which at least is forcing!)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bob Holl|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jallerton: I disagree. If you don't include any game forces in your 1NT response then why play it as forcing?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By NT at the right hand...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ryskiel_: good evening - I m Ryszard Kielczewski from Poland|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dimi: Dean what is the temperature in Pula ?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: I asked Henry if a woman can be semi-pregnant. He did not reply. Either she is or she is not, period.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Nice to see u.|pg||
mc|12|nt|finch:  Declarer has a difficult problem on the club back|pg||
nt|finch:  he might need the finesse for his 9th trick, but if the majors come in and East has the @CK he's just off by finessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: yeah but no diffrent which card to play here:) lucky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Forcing 1N was originally used to allow invitational hands to bid 1N rather than at the two level, and facilitate 2/1 gf|pg||
nt|finch:  I wonder what declarer can infer from West winning the first spade with the queen and the second with the 10|pg||
nt|finch:  what holdings would do that?|pg||
nt|jallerton: KQ10 and KQ104|pg||
nt|finch:  or as has just be suggested to me, someone with the @CK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think if E had the @ck he would have returned the @d2|pg||
nt|finch:  there are plenty of positions where you just don't bother given suit preference without an ace|pg||
nt|finch:  and this is one of them|pg||
nt|jallerton: @s 3-3 seems more likely than @s4-2 with both rounded suits coming in|pg||
nt|finch:  why would East want to help declarer by showing whether or not he has the @CK?|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: stil thinking|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not a great result for N-S|pg||
nt|finch:  admittedly not very likely, but an extra chance|pg||
nt|dimi: only, well i was the last 2 years in Pula and i think it was a littel bit warmer even in the night:)|pg||
nt|poky: 1@C with transfer responses here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 7 than 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hii Roland, Bob an Povl and all kibs...welcome all....:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: double or 2@C now as west ?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Can they bid slam?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|poky: S hand is between 2@C/3@C/2@H|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: we can saw Grzegorz Narkiewicz, silver medalist of European Championships from Ostend and bronze medalist in Open Pairs - Pozna 2011|pg||
mb|2D|nt|finch:  I think they must have had a bidding misunderstanding at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: likely to bid slam now that 2@c has been opened, one would think|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sommer: X ok followed by 3@C ..as done|pg||
nt|poky: probably 2@C is the best bid, because it carries most flexibility|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch:  after a 2@C opening and a heart suit, North has a virtual slam force|pg||
nt|rodal f: An X to come from E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@H should set the suit and ask for a cuebid|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3nt is gone as it was after they supported each other in @H|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dimi: nasty 5:0 break in @d ... d! slam will be hard to make|pg||
nt|poky: but as I already told, they both like to bid it aggressively :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: North will have a problem showing the power of his @D suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: his partner Cezary Serek grow up as bridge player only few years ago bu climbed in his bridge skilfull|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  the old-fashioned way to play is the 3@H asks for a first round control, responder bids 3NT with a king but no ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which it probably did|pg||
nt|jallerton: assuming 2@C was their strongest bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  with that understanding 3@S showed the ace|pg||
nt|poky: strange bit, it should be stopper asking and not hidden suit showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: but, to be honest, they like to be very creative in most undiscussed sequences :)|pg||
nt|poky: bit=bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps N shud have shown @D suit first - then bid @S twice...|pg||
nt|poky: this wasn't possible|pg||
nt|poky: because 1@S response is relayish, it doesn't show @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt 1@S show @D suit or NT?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|finch:  but with that understanding so did 5@C, so they may be cuebidding first or second|pg||
nt|finch:  redouble here will show first round club control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't he also bid 3NT with a singleton, Frances? Any second round control? I don't know Acol that well|pg||
nt|finch:  yes, sorry, 3NT with a second round control; cue with a first round control|pg||
nt|henryb:  As I played that, 3@s showed the @sA and no other ace. 4N would show two aces|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|poky: 1NT would have been invitational for the balanced range|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jallerton: In original Acol, you were supposed to make a positive on any hand with 2 aces|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|poky: and 1@S is showing all the weak hands w/o 4M and some strong hands|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: possibly make 10 tricks - but both sides have his troubles|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|dimi: agressive X ... demands the @d lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont like Herland's x - might have saved NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: Though 6@D down on split|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poky: aggressive bidding with thin values and misfit in spades backfires|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5NT should show something extra but no further 2nd round control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to play, not so at the table|pg||
nt|bobholl: J would have been easier for P :)|pg||
nt|sommer: very lucky start for the young, nice ladies from Austria10 + 11 from "nowhere" (6@D was too hard)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|poky: but it is only -1 since the @H lead didn't come|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - Herland asked for @S lead - dummy's first bid suit?|pg||
nt|poky: yeah|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, I thought I was in 7|pg||
nt|finch:  yes I think 6 isn't so hard|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suppose the right way to play this is @cA, @c ruff, @h, @c ruff, @d finesse|pg||
nt|finch:  not in 6 it isn't|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not?|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d ruff?|pg||
nt|finch:  the ace of diamonds might get ruffed off|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, making 7 is an imp|pg||
nt|henryb:  Once both opponents follow to three clubs and one heart, the probability of a stiff diamond becomes vanishingly small|pg||
nt|finch:  so you need it to be a smaller chance than 1 in 21 that there is a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|s2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|poky: or probably fir the @D ruff|pg||

nt|rodal f: No bid from W over 1NT. |pg||
mb|2C|nt|finch:  would have been, rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  this auction is typically used to show a hand too good to overcall 2NT the first round|pg||
nt|poky: X showing the strong balaced variant|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud be -800...|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|jallerton: @ha, duck a @h, lead towards K|pg||
nt|finch:  declarer can afford to play ace of hearts and duck a heart before playing towards the queen|pg||
nt|finch:  hearts are very likely to be 4-2 from 2@S bid selected by West|pg||
nt|poky: N opts to describe his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: which is strange|pg||
nt|poky: because 3@D is the right bit if he has 5-7 hcp without game ambitions|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cud even have gone for -1100 - Herland got away with one|pg||
nt|poky: but as I said, they like creative solutions|pg||

nt|vugraphzna: small break here|pg||
nt|jallerton: Blame whoever invented the "law" of total tricks|pg||
nt|poky: and I'm told they are on good road to 7NT|pg||
nt|dimi: 7NT for E-W|pg||
nt|poky: the only problem is, they cannot show 8carder suits|pg||
nt|poky: only 7+ carder|pg||
nt|sharkey: Namyats wud be effective here - showing solid Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: W opens the bidding|pg||
nt|sharkey: that makes a difference....|pg||
mb|p|nt|poky: hardly anyone plays 1@H-4@D as Namyats for spades :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some hopefully learnd a bit now.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|finch:  South has plenty of ways to show a strong spade raise here, so 3@S is a nice semi-preemptive call|pg||

nt|sommer: inventive 1NT, but how did 4@S go 2 down??|pg||
nt|bobholl: deserves|pg||
nt|sharkey: havent seen that recently....:)|pg||
nt|poky: maybe someone will find the unlucky 7@H?|pg||
mb|2N|an|!|nt|finch:  North still has much the same problem, with 7 of the things|pg||
nt|poky: but this isnt probably since East should remove it to 7@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: WE can lost his @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Look at the @H contract compared the @S.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|poky: without much thought|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud thin East wud insist on @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: North does have 3 extra spades, and his only side card in partner's suit. Tough not to bid 5@s here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch:  ace of clubs, AK of hearts on which West shows a doubleton, heart ruffed high, spade finesse?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's not a solid suit, the 10 missing :)|pg||

nt|poky: Occam's razor = keep the things simple|pg||
