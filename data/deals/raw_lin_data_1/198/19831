nt|peachy: Lively looking hand to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andyv:  and S will have hard time ignoring the 6 card suit|pg||

nt|andyv:  watch out Jordan...they're moving faster and faster|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, but then come the undos -- no new bids, just an alert.|pg||
nt|rv: important system aspect for partnerships to discuss? 3@c could potentially show both majors with longer OM (@s here)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E trying to slow the train down|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think EW in CR are going to have a chat about this auction.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has a 3 loser hand...they should reach game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should 2@S not be forcing on the auction in the closed room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it is not, you have to bid 4@H over 1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Only on this planet, Roland, not on several others.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 2@C followed by something|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: wise to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...500-800 certainly possible in 5@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was -3 in the CR so still gains 3 imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd have a hard time bidding with the E hand on that aucition in the CR...only 100% force to cue bid and then bid @s|pg||

pc|h6|nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||
nt|andyv:  E here decides to show the @c stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W decides to dive off the deep end|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the best spot  is reached by West|pg||
nt|psyck:  With a hand unable to show @d's later, I'd prefer to open 1@d & rebid @c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: last set was 44-39 heaps of imps traded|pg||
nt|jcwla: To quote "Miracle Mile," What's the hurry, Harry?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will make with no problem losing 4 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: K&R has that last S hand at a generous 8.6: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ83+Q2+873+Q973 |pg||
nt|panosk: now secured , the friendly lie that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the difference between 6@H now and 6@H over1?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: will likely duck on sp  |pg||
nt|sybarra: *duck one |pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: I am not surprosed, it looked like a 7 count at first glance|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT seems like the field resting spot here.|pg||
nt|peachy: *surprised|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi aria|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she might as well have bid 6@H directly|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps less likely to make now?|pg||
nt|ssbux: why 3C, either 2c or 4c will be better and not misleading as notrump probe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  this looks more scientific, Roland...esp. when her partner showed her useful values in the @c suit|pg||

nt|gracelin: Hi Jean-Paul and Tommy|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: a decent save non-vul here as 4@H easy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: I am guessing that W took 3NT to show the high end of a 1@H-response in values.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panosk: redouble showing 1st round control in @S|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: at these colours asking for too much. pass the right decision.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice auction|pg||
nt|kerasidis: very usufull....|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately game not reached CR|pg||

nt|ssbux: Hi Patrick, will be seeing you playing next week|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|gracelin: oh  yes, in a similar event with Men's teams|pg||
pc|h9|nt|blewah: from the 3@h response to 2@s I think NS play 2/1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  nothing left but the @h gess and N may even lead that|pg||
nt|andyv:  guess|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|panosk: E showed 3 spades i think with mud|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi aria|pg||
nt|blewah: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: elimination play needed, which would be good play to avoid @S guess.|pg||

nt|gracelin: The prize money in this Hua-Yuen Cup totalled US$200,000 which exceeds the Yeh"s Cup.|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: You are unlucky if you go down in 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you will with both finesses off|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  trick is for NS to stay low |pg||
nt|rv: red blooded pre-empt by Marion Michielsen|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: board one was plyed in1 NT doubled and made in CR|pg||
nt|gracelin: The 8 teams will share a pool of US$150,000 in the teams.  Another US$50,000 for the pairs.|pg||
nt|twcho: the prize money is enviable for men. :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcwla: On the cards and S's opening, 6@H is not an outre spot on 2, but the best-bid hand award awaits further nominations.|pg||
nt|rv: what is 4@d here by Smith, some play it as good raise in @Cs, a few others play it as both majors|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer to play 4@d as both majors 5-5|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|jcwla: 1@D misguided in third seat.  It's their hand - put some pressure on.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now, let's talk about this double -- or the lack of a double by the N hand in similar situations.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats what i call trump support |pg||

nt|rnmalik: 3@C was bergen as I look at it and S upgraded his hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need this trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D Ace and @H back:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT is probably a sort of Lebensold to start a weak bid.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jcwla: Anybody have a problem with 3@D?|pg||
nt|rv: this slam is worse than 1 of 2 finesses, if @h finesse is off chances are not very bright|pg||
mb|p|nt|ssbux: are they playing Lebansohl after a reversed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the defense should be pretty easy as long as W doesn't get overly anxious and cashes out early|pg||
nt|ssbux: another unlucky slam for EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's all coming up orange so far.|pg||
nt|rv: still very decent slam just on @h finesse|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes very decent, but unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: looks like -1 again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep   could be -2 if they can get second ruff |pg||
nt|panosk: @D2 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd ruff = the same 2 trump tricks he started with?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 Nt is aking to go back to 3 @c in first stage|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and  last !!!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: You and your favorite partner need to have agreement on what it means: does it ask for a @D lead (so that if you don't double you are suggesting a different lead) or does it say "I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: have a 2@D rebid that they stole"?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Plenty of room for both major K's to be in N, let alone just the @HK.|pg||
nt|twcho: is this common method played in France?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rv: if @h finesse is off, you need @s finesse on and black suit squeeze|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: north, with a little extra, may consider to take action other than 3C, but she has a boarderline hand. |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rv: atleast 55% or so |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes   perhaps  South was not  very optimistec   it  not such a bad slam!!|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|jcwla: I prefer the latter meaning and trust that pd will lead my suit in the absence of a clearly better alternative; however, I do have some pds who require the double if I want the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: lead of that suit.|pg||
nt|peachy: Again, remembering Precision context|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panosk: bad break in trumps 4@H had no chance gd game though|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D isnt simple support in @D must be 2way checkback with game forc hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  at 50 a pop, down 1 or 2 shouldn't make much difference as it's almost impossible to stop in 2@s or 2@h with the NS hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: probably another push |pg||
nt|ssbux: ten of D, signal for S?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panosk: for more info check this link http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TwoWayCheckback.html|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @d would be easier|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: good unblock N after his good lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: now 2@H and still a @D to lose|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|cJ|nt|jcwla: Right - here, it is clearly showing @D length.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was a horrid contract created by E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: True, Aces needed for upgradation.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: unless|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|twcho: still they are NV so south no need to push so hard|pg||
nt|gracelin: south does have only one Q and 2 Jacks, but his minor suit fit plus a H shortage maybe enough to find a game invitation bid.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||

mb|1D|nt|panosk: this is the best way if you play it  :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nicola Smith and Sally Brock are very experienced, so they will get on with life and not let these results affect them|pg||
nt|rv: luck does even out in long tourney, British ladies should be resilient here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Precision NS then Raija?|pg||

nt|rv: incidentally 9 tricks are available for N-S with lucky lie of red suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: The bridge Championship is being played at Shenzen, a beautiful city adjacent to Hongkong. |pg||

mb|2S|nt|andyv:  everyone wiling to play 1N except the author of the bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will be fortunate to go down 1|pg||
nt|ssbux: very lucky 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: n/S being talked out of good spot in @S's|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: confirmed by a spec, thx|pg||
nt|peachy: I really do not have any first hand knowledge, but looks like Precision|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C shows more high cards indeed so in case EW go to 5 level N doent have a clue about pards hand|pg||
nt|loe48: many use 2nt as good raise in this pos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Carl|pg||
nt|loe48: invite + in spade|pg||
nt|panosk: with the 4@S bid that is, agree with Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes many alternative bids...depends on partners aggrements|pg||
nt|kemperg: to much in @C nothing in red suits, 4@S good for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: N was a bit conservative for me shud have tried 2 spades|pg||
nt|rv: anyone open 2n (20-21) with North hand, what does K-R say?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Michielsen showing 18-19 balanced with her 1NT|pg||
nt|twcho: south is conservative not to overcall|pg||
nt|gracelin: the winner of the 8-team competiton will take home US$30,000 and the  8 also has US$12,000.  At moment, France is leading after one match and the Dutch is lying 3rd.|pg||
nt|twcho: probably deterred by the spot cards she held|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ianmcc: @d most likely, will cost a trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Ns   remained silence with 25  hpc |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|rv: I suspect K-R will show more than 19 hcp for North hand, possibly not enough for 2n opening|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@h and @h|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcwla: 20.45 per KR|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|peachy: This event does not have website or any other information online|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S made on 3 so an early 12 imps to HuaChu|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ssbux: with a passed partner, no convenient bid|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: however can't beat 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: one of those hands that cries out for a trump lead|pg||
nt|loe48: but..as crazy cards can be..opponents may have contract too..so 4s is also blocking alot same it can make|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ssbux: dangerous with 1NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: I agree with south's pass over 1C, but may overcall 1H with the N hand.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: south is bit weak   to vercall 1 Nt and has 2 cards in @h not enogh to double she estimated|pg||
nt|gracelin: not for lead directing, of course, but allows partner to join the party with suitable hands.|pg||
nt|twcho: if the @c7 is replaced by @c10, I guess many will overcall 1NT then|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|nt|panosk: no |pg||
nt|panosk: with @D 2-2 and J10 @C dropping they can even make 3@C :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kiwibridge: the uppercut works !|pg||
nt|sybarra: miight get a trump now |pg||
nt|rv: will anyone in panel open 2n?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think 3@C is better as N will know S also have defensive values. I wud bid 4@S without @CKJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes indeed, Tommy.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on board 3 NL pir reached 3Nt which should nod be a success|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kerasidis: in one of them doubled could gain some imps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  making 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would only because I hate the rebids|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|twcho: some imps back to France then|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe it's good for NS to defend 2S rather than bidding their 25 points game which wouldn't make.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|panosk: my only concern is that if opps bid 5@C pass by N isnt forcing after 4@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: can see only 7 tricks for declarer.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: par contract par result perfect :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  S needs to cash A@h and exit with @s or @c|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: NT range possibly 14-16, but we have no evidence other than bidding and the fat they play Precision :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's fine otherwise. I have a @D suit that is well worth mentioning (playing in, leading) and I don't expect the counterpart to bid 2NT, so I would open 1@D.|pg||

nt|peachy: This is an invitational event, 8 sponsors with their teams|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: for the French pair  i have  an idea :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panosk: for me 4@S can be 6small spades and some single, but is a matter of approach |pg||
nt|rv: 2@d shows equal length (2-2 or 3-3) in majors usually|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: I was kind enough not to say anything about hte 1NT last hand, but the words are just bubbling on my tongue|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is just cruising for a bruising here.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H=4 card support good hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  no battle at all as S decided to open a light NT|pg||
nt|loe48: true|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume 1 NT =13-15 or 12-14|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a nice advantage of a system that leaves that step in between.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is exactly why you need 2@C for the majors, and not 2@D or 2@H as in Capp and DONT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: standard lead onthis bidding should be trump with strong opposition in minors|pg||

nt|sharkey: West made slam try in @D but E turned it down.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: do tell Gary |pg||
nt|rv: low @h best now|pg||
nt|rv: still likely to be trick short|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@D not unreasonable with decent trump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see declarer coming to 8 tricks with proper defense.  With club forcing fummy to ruff, defense will be ahead.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: sure Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: either club or trump return will be fine.|pg||
nt|twcho: and good shift to @d by north|pg||

nt|gracelin: thoughtful|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: in a Major it is always over the Jack he claimed|pg||

nt|panosk: ah yes and only played with people who aplied his rule too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: apparently his partners were forced to follow his rule|pg||

nt|rv: pitch a @c now and another on @HK, can he make it now?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

pc|c8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|panosk: since spades 3-3|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer may succeed when she gains the lead in dummy with @s9|pg||

nt|kerasidis: with a little try...cards lie favourable except dias|pg||

nt|sybarra: stuffed N in |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Helen Sobel also had a good method: she raised her dress above the knees, the man who looked did not hold the Queen :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  :) |pg||
nt|panosk: i mean if you get there you will have to make :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Playing highest @S to prevent short honors from taking tricks to extent possible and draw trumps like so.|pg||
nt|kemperg: destroyd the entrys for double hook in @D, 11 instead of 12 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|blewah: hard for W to find E entry |pg||

nt|gracelin: agree.  though they might also make 3H with D 3-3.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes because the second @s stop is almost invisible|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: they almost avoided the failing game|pg||
nt|twcho: there is a promotion chance with 4th @d|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Now you know!|pg||
nt|gracelin: West is thinking whether she should return a H after the first D, if declarer has a singleton HK.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|ianmcc: defence's start promising|pg||
nt|twcho: not easy for west to find the @d continuation|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: N achieved the desired result with that x. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W is flat and minumum so should decline the invite|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gracelin: in that case she needs to take their HA before the 4th D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, Tommy, unless East has a way to deny the holding of HA in her discard.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be west shoul have switched to @h at trick 2  keeping options|pg||
nt|twcho: unless east find the K discard|pg||
nt|twcho: @hK|pg||
nt|gracelin: East should know west has two Hearts by passing 2H, so maybe he could pitch HK to deny HA.  If West has it, West will cash it anyway.|pg||
nt|twcho: then it will be a masterpiece|pg||
nt|ssbux: difficult to discard HK, what if declarer hold AQ in heart and Ax in C|pg||
nt|twcho: and one of the best defended hand then|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: E had a good rebid on 1major|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panosk: they might even have 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h vs 4@s|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jcwla: Yes, far more worthy of a bid than the 1@D S egested on 1.|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl could be showing majors, a common def to strong C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same story can be repeated in CR:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect the CR auction to be widely duplicated.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: 7 imps quite a cruel penalty really|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2@c bid was reasonable on previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thought it should be only -1|pg||
nt|blewah: i think that's the most likely scenario, Rashed|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play 2@c (fourth suit) as Inv+ and not unconditional GF here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 1NT best now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing is ideal|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kiwibridge: DF makes 7@D on this hand :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 2@c as Inv+ with opener to show 2 ranges (11-bad 14) and good 14-17|pg||
nt|gracelin: bue even West did find the 4th round D play, declarer may still guess it right since SA is sure with East after west has shown an AKQxx suit in D.  also a likely honor in H.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: looks like a club system in action |pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe over 2NT an accepting 3@H and then back to 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Surely N is minimum for the original X?  Oh well, S would have done anyway and maybe should have to begin with.|pg||
nt|sybarra: on this bd|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11+11 = game vul I think|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 1-2 down|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer just needs to guess whether East start with AJ of trumps or AJ10|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Prec|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't understand these methods :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so bidding never got to the 4 level|pg||
nt|panosk: but +300 is much beter than -100|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: 4@D x was -3.|pg||

nt|sharkey: I think I wud|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panosk: depends on my mood, if serious no :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: makes even on the improbable @d lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|twcho: without any significant spot cards, west wisely chose 4@s to be the final contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: best contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we warn them about 6 @D|pg||
nt|panosk: 6nt looks gd as cards lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 12 in NT again a friendly K@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D I'm told is GF stayman, why he'd do it with only one major I don't know|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT in W or 2@D?|pg||
nt|blewah: NS would go for more if they know they also have fit in @c |pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: @CQ likely here to try to create an entry.|pg||

nt|panosk: the friendliest kind |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 5  6 @H a push |pg||

nt|sybarra: gm Henry :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  gm Shirley @h|pg||
nt|panosk: hi henry|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 0745 for us here, hence the gm |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or the @D do not behave H|pg||
nt|henryb:  you have 4@d tricks on any break: look at the spots|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm watching live cricket from England I bet Roalnd is too|pg||
nt|panosk: the real question here is shud he accept?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland it probably at the match  |pg||
nt|henryb:  England - India?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, and England again amassing a huge 1st innings score|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we in deep thought? or losing conex?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think thought |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D for me, welcome Rashed :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Playing 2/1, I think 2D is automatic|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: the more the merrier it is for me, one is quite lonely|pg||
nt|andyv:  since EW can make game, was E's 3@h bid conservative?|pg||
nt|kemperg: doubt, but we would end in 2|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wouldt either|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: 4@H makes whereas @S does not.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooer|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is the word oof|pg||
nt|panosk: that was a danger after 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N should possibly be converting|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see he should but at the table not sure you know to do that |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|panosk: bad lead for decl cant see bare K@H |pg||
nt|peachy: I think four is the perfect number, three is great too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|blewah: W bids reds and NT, E blacks only|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely end up playing 6NT or @D, as per their system.|pg||
nt|blewah: sure they are on the same wave |pg||
nt|ssbux: famous dish in Beijing, the Peking duck|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: high quality bridge as mentioned by Roland right at the start of this broadcast|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rnmalik: The least expected.:)|pg||
nt|blewah: i was wrong, ok.|pg||
nt|peachy: G'night all, enjoy the match!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesn't look like it thought E was heading for 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Bye Raija, nice sleep.|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW plays 2/1 I think - East showed limit raise with 3 trumps so they stopped in 3@S|pg||
nt|loe48: its not an opener 1,2 seat imo|pg||
nt|kerasidis: aceless with no alternative bid|pg||
nt|loe48: 3rd seat 1s okay|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: can he do 6 @d only loding 1 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be able to make it as E also has 4@C|pg||
nt|twcho: though even 3NT is cold with even break in minors|pg||
nt|twcho: but 4@s rates to be a superior contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer wisely won the first club trick, or a D shift might be damaging.|pg||
nt|gracelin: though with HA in south and, even an opening D lead will not hurt the contract.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ok 10 easy tricks  |pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks to the H10.|pg||
mc|10|nt|kemperg: N has enough to try make life diff. for strong @C|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes agree|pg||
nt|rv: now another @c, if finessed by Smith, North can win and back a @h, still declarer can get home for 9 tricks with @s breaking|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to say I prefer even the @C5 to the 7 for the opening salvo.|pg||
nt|rv: yes I like second best leads from poor suit, many experts even prefer attitude leads against nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed, 3NT .|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2N guarantees 4@s...many play garbage stayman and would have to bid 2@s with S hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|panosk: E doesnt know which major but he correctly thinks its spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are various methods, my multi 2@D = weak 2 either major OR 20-22 with a 5 card suit OR and 8+ playing tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a lot of folks include a strong bid in multi  |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not as a rule with most pard's I play with on bbo |pg||
nt|andyv:  but momentum may put them there|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: or 2 strong as in NZ version|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may try 5@d now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 @h should  show 5 5    usually|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|twcho: without fit with partner, east stayed low by bidding 2N instead of 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|twcho: and with much better than minimum hand, west happily accepts the invitation|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rnmalik: 2 finesses.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kemperg: no, with garbage you have both majors and pass 2@H|pg||
nt|panosk: yes there are various version , also 1 with strong 3 suiter|pg||
nt|ianmcc: and drop|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kemperg: next|pg||
nt|sybarra: in general,  multi is not/can not be played in usa|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  W must have realized the 4@c bid was already an overbid and did well to stop in 4|pg||
nt|blewah: agree, 4@c was an upgrade|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: I see 11 tricks, 12 made in CR|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: funny USA, trying to protect the innocent, actually it's easy enough to defend|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: with  9 minors cards known in West hand , East judged that she does not care to propose her second major suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: next week in Tienjin China will see another Men's Elite team invitational with high cash prize.  USA, Italy/England, Netherland, Sweden, Norway , 2 teams from China and the Asia ...|pg||
nt|gracelin: Stars will compete in this event.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: we need help from operator or spectators to decipher subsequent auction post 2n|pg||
nt|twcho: a very sensible auction|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  right...if they had garbage hand...but since 2N over 2@h would deny a 4 card major, they would have to bid 2@s with the invite hand and 4 spades.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzmc: 2NT show 4 support|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: agree Gary,  and many have heard me say I played in Neth.  and evey jr, youth and granny had a defense to multi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On the bidding CR had better chance of playing 6@D.|pg||
nt|rv: conventional (read traditional) response to jacoby 2n is 3 level bids show stiff, 3M denies stiff with extra length, 3n shows extras hcp possibly 15-17 (maybe 5422), 4 level bids ...|pg||
nt|rv: shows second 5 card suit, 4M shows sub-min/min opening with no redeeming feature|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to beg off here, thanks all, enjoy the rest.|pg||
nt|rv: there are plenty of variations to traditional jacoby and conventional jacoby is hardly played by most of the experts nowadays|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  Not true, Shirley. Multi can be used in any team game of 6+ boards where the players are "Flight A"|pg||
nt|panosk: yes if you dont know what to bid wait till they say their suit and then take action like double |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: our Juniors love to play and defend it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: Relaxing to know off a keycard, don't have to think.  Can't complain about this pace - halfway through in 40 mins.|pg||
nt|twcho: what is the prize size? it is comparable to this tournament?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: but it is limited Henry |pg||
nt|rv: seems to be a very complex jacoby variation by experienced British ladies here:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|c8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|gracelin: Men are not as worthy as Women, Tommy.  The prize money is less there.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: here's another possible slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 this time|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now here we do have a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now this is a slam and probably a flat board too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS should have no trouble getting to 6...question is if they have the tools to get to 7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: too many tricks.|pg||
nt|rv: well bid nonetheless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: ok|pg||
mb|1D|nt|panosk: the one i like and its completely banned is 2@H weak in unknown major|pg||
nt|gracelin: But every match has a match prize.  Winner take US$1,500 and loser $500.|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: thats really dangerous|pg||
nt|rv: last part of last auction can be explained 4NT = RKCB 5@D = 1 key cd 5@H = asking 2nd rd control 6@C = yes + 3rd rd control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D = 1 major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Multi defence to 1NT|pg||
nt|rv: sry 5@h is @sQ ask, 6@c shows @SQ and @CK|pg||
nt|twcho: I suspect that it is because of the strength of Chinese Women Team.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: these are 16 boards per match  a full round robin of 8 teams|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: back to this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: nice pANOS|pg||
nt|sharkey: You open N hand 1@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brock must be happy to learn that partner has a major|pg||
nt|ssbux: The Asia Stars shall comprise of the veteran pairs Lasut and Manoppo from Indonsia, Patrick Huang and his partner from Chinese Taipei and Samuel Wan and Dereck Zen from Hong Kong|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: Panos sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a dangerous 5@D bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @C holding in N hand and @h holding in S hand will be hard to describe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least her majors are equally good|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: nice bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H now competitive or inviting?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Precision 2@C here, 6+ in the absence of a major, now 7+  NS will shortly be in game.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S is good raise of @D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since about 60% of our tables are now in team events, either 2-day KOs or Swiss, its not true that it is even close to barred|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: thats tempting :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i would|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or is it bad|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I don't like vul 2 level O/C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you take the money as South or just bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|rv: sitting here I will surely take money|pg||
nt|rv: at the table, I will contemplate a bit more and still take the money|pg||
nt|rv: on accurate defense it could go for 800?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price right for a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all Thx Roland|pg||
nt|rv: Hi P.Sridhar, gm|pg||
nt|ssbux: welcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  gm P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am in full agreement with RV there- odds do not favour that 2@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: GM Andy/RV :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: high level competitors have tools these days to reach their contracts even after 2@d/2@s, so some usefulness of intervention is already lost|pg||
nt|psridhar: and the risk of going for 500/800 exixts still|pg||
nt|psridhar: exists|pg||
nt|rv: 800 is not possible for N-S, on perfect defense declarer could still get out for -500, not very costly|pg||
nt|ssbux: Sorry, I mean veteran pair|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kemperg: dbl should be inviting for me|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Too good for 2@H?|pg||
nt|loe48: to strong for 2h non vul|pg||
nt|twcho: who will be your partner, Patrick?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Logically, it should be that for others, too|pg||
nt|loe48: if vul 2h okay|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, weak 2 is 4-8 with green against red|pg||
nt|rv: Brock must have heaved sigh of relief|pg||
nt|psridhar: meanwhile appreciate how much better the E hand is if one of those minor honors she has -is in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least this can't be misinterpreted as a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: pref both:)|pg||
nt|rv: yes I would O/C with KQJ9XX, AX, XXX, XX even at these colors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Marion may think that this is a slam invite since Dekkers did not bid 4@H the round before|pg||
nt|psridhar: and that hand also is 10 HCP :)|pg||
nt|rv: and still may not with just J or Q in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand her way of thinking|pg||
nt|rv: 5 level is safe, no harm even if Marion bids 4@s|pg||
nt|ssbux: Herstein?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: weak 2 is out of the question in any vul for me|pg||
nt|loe48: vul vs non vul i open 2h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: just a max in other circumstances for me|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers will sign-off in 5@h quickly|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brock's pass of X must show @d , 2@d X is possibly a good spot for EW ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not bid 4@H before? Double + 4@H slam invitational she must be thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: Herstein Liu, used to be my teammate but in this tournament I will partner with him.|pg||
nt|twcho: good luck Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: tks, ust try not to disgrace ourself.  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: agree with you on the last hand, 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  W better lead a trump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can borrow one from E.:)|pg||
nt|panosk: if you need to open 1 is much beter |pg||
nt|gracelin: It's nice to see a natural 2D over the 1NT rebid.  Many play this as a GF check-back.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  anyone like N's 4@s bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still time for brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps S should keycard and then sign off in 5@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: Roland's point is very valid -but before that we should know whats X of 2@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding 5@h directly might give N some encouragement to bid on|pg||
nt|rv: Marion Michielsen has an excellent hand opposite unilateral jump to 4@h, a) no wastage in @h, b)4 trumps and c) all those controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double of 2@D would usually be "I want to double at least one major"|pg||
nt|psridhar: if it was a value showing X , N is justified in slam try; if it was a take out X, i think she has less cause|pg||
nt|psridhar: oh penalty X ?|pg||
nt|rv: I would treat North's hand as super-max for the auction so far|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: N agrees|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would not be my choice with 4-card @H's but they're obv on the same wavelength.|pg||
nt|peachy: North is delighted to go, five good trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the match is very tight   now 2 imps difference|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and what % are Flight A ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he can't have liked his 2@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 2 aces S must bid 5NT. GS.|pg||
nt|gracelin: then they also use 2C to force a 2D rebid to stop in 2D.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: I suspect that not many in North America and Europe have heard about the city Shenzhen in the Guangdong province, the venue for this tournament. Shenzhen has more than 10 million ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: inhabitants!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: French pair Ns  uses only 2 @c as a check back stayman|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: @C lead would be interesting.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if K@c is lead, E needs to rise with A and return @d|pg||
nt|psridhar: N has a difficult task -if she is required to guess that her partner made a "penalty oreineted X" and changed her mind later|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, no worries for 5@d:)|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure if N-S playing any last train cue bids, if they play Dekkers could have bid 5@d with any sort of interest and her 5@h would state I have no interest|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h = long @H, with that suit, she couldnt possibly have expected to defend 2@H X|pg||
nt|psridhar: good, thoughtful lead -will set 5N here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one probably won't make the textbooks|pg||
nt|blewah: and 5 card support|pg||
nt|rv: yes great lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what a horror double|pg||
nt|blewah: E "knew" S has his own suit|pg||
nt|twcho: a very comfortable contract for NS|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: why x in S where opps are being vul are in a losing contract.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you Roland, your suspicion is spot on, I'm sure|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, he can afford to misguess everything.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|kerasidis: this b would be very interesting in pair contest|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ssbux: ok, which room, Open?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West suprisingly did not continue @h losing a trick|pg||
nt|twcho: Even 4@h is not without chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe she feared partner would be ruffing with Qxx or A10x for a natural trump trick.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|rv: North should duck this to restrict damage|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  down 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may have been a battle between 500 and 550|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6N was indeed found CR for another 2 imps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  In Swiss, about a third; in KOs about a quarter; but anyone is allowed to play Flight A in a Swiss|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: Bill tells me CR in 6@C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: vul against non -vul.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so EW probably saved a couple of imps by pulling 5@dx|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lebridgeur: 4 @h   is very optimistc contract !|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|twcho: certainly. :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rv: you see luck has already evened out, E-W bid a good slam on deal 3 which went down, here 2@d O/C has caused problem to opps who have overreached|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|blewah: from +400 to -130|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcwla: N is known to have real @H's here - there was a hand in the 2010 Rosenblum final (written up by Howard Weinstein in the August Bridge World) where a 2@D preempt was doubled on a ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: big 4-4-3-2 and the 2@H raise advanced to four, which bombed when pd was 3-3-4-3. |pg||
nt|gracelin: south is a little conservative in rebidding 2D only.  Some might try an invitational 3D.|pg||
mc|9|nt|gracelin: but even after that  can't see NS reaching 4H.|pg||

nt|rv: with that hand with South, even GS on rite?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kiwibridge: 10 with W having all the rest|pg||
mb|1H|nt|panosk: 10 actually and yes why didnt he tried at least ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 10, with all suits behaving nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: right 10 |pg||
nt|psridhar: yes-so slam on with less one card less|pg||
nt|rv: even if South had one of the minor honor cards missing in PS's example hand, LS would be cold|pg||
nt|gracelin: Now a not so routine 3NT for NS.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|twcho: and 4@h will go down if defense find the @d switch in time|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 @h by North|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: showing good @d   and propose for NT contract|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|kiwibridge: more Precise here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: or EW may be in trouble...|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess it's a fit showing jump showing invitation strength.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck:  usually done with 5 card @c though|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: its not just the actual pts count he also had gd spots|pg||
nt|henryb:  Slam on a hook that loses|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@H down on the losing finesse|pg||

nt|psyck:  but this hand seems to be a good time to uise it with 4 esp woth those @d's|pg||
nt|twcho: with all those spot cards, 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3@c  shows @d and @c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: 6@C was -3 to make the carnage worth 15|pg||
nt|blewah: did it really make?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange and defence to other contracts after preempt by P.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure Jean-Paul is right.  3C showed a 3NT invitational hand with D fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer might return a H after winning HK.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: W keeps them out by bidding probably|pg||
nt|psridhar: but NS need to sort out if Dekkers wd bid that way holding such pattrens|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: only point for consideration, would South have bid 5@d as last train cue bid with such hands?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: weird in my opinion....N doesnt know south's 18 points hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Score another one for weak NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: to make sure she establish a 2nd H trick.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: no  3@c   shows limit fit in @d  with @c suit usually 5 4 the other way|pg||
nt|twcho: so another sensible auction leading to a cold contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: OK, Jeam-Paul must be right about the French girls bidding :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I've watched a lot of Meckwell and their slam bidding is quite weak, they do make up for it in other ways for sure|pg||
nt|blewah: so he was sure @sK would be left bare by S?|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@h probably asked for 3rd round control |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: and 5@S showed yes.|pg||
nt|blewah: they must have played together before|pg||
nt|kerasidis: West thinks now.. ouffff what a releif :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: The 2 Chinese ladies team met in the 1st match and saw a low scoring 16:14 VP split.  All other 3 matches were one-sided.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jcwla: As the linesmen used to say when we came on court at 6-5 in the third set, "We only come in to close."|pg||
nt|blewah: anyway, slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: an  easy 4 @s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: you are right 2 cards of @H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: But there S did bid 3NT over 2@H.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ending trick 11 W @SAX @CJ and E last trump and @SQx so south 100% squeezed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: to me this is the worst auction so far|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no multi S will he bid 4 now, yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: seems light for 2N|pg||
nt|rv: what is Brock's 2n here?, I would have passed and not even venture 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@d, one or both majors?|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone texas the hand?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think they dont like slams as much as they do games hence they become more conservative not that they cant |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourIndex.aspx?tourid=1174  for the tournament website in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer must lose a 2nd club trick so in fact will need HA to be on side, or a good guess if North leads one at some stage.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kemperg: seems 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One, the Multi defense|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Apologies for mentioning Germany before. They are not taking part, Canada is|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  I'd bid it|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: I abhor that fatuous 2NT resposne to the nebulous 1@D|pg||

nt|blewah: can make with the trump lay out|pg||
nt|andyv:  are there enough tricks on @h lead?|pg||
nt|blewah: needs to run @h from dummy twice|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may have draw too many trumps and doesn't have enough entry fr both setting up club and lead toward dummy's HK.|pg||

nt|kerasidis: and if he does why not bidding 2 nt over 2spades?|pg||
nt|loe48: no|pg||

nt|psyck:  yes, thanks Patrick, voice commentators were discussing it & i was replying to to them based on what you said|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cant be all bad|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andyv:  2@h is truly a dreamer's bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: I'm not privvy to their agreements nor that steady on Precision, what might 4NT mean I wonder|pg||

mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: CR in 5@S X I'm told so another swing coming|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid but makes 6@H as the cards are placed.|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: factor the passed hand pd in rv :)|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D is GF checkback, 2@s showed 3@s|pg||

nt|rv: she is thinking of catering to 4-1 @s break with @SAQ8X with East|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: E did not go for the possible penalty pass in W, |pg||

nt|jcwla: The case of the missing initial pass.|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad, 1@h by S would have been more fun|pg||

nt|kemperg: good in honneurs, but shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  no a matter of overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: the critical point was W not to get trick|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: 5@SX was 500 a 5 imps to jiegao|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree but timid pass by E of NT.:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed it was|pg||
nt|blewah: i don't see very often now, with 12 count|pg||
nt|rv: this shows 11-14, it could even go upto 15 hcp in some partnerships because of 1@s is inconvinient |pg||
nt|psyck:  5@d best here with 4@s in trouble|pg||
nt|twcho: and 3N hopeless|pg||
nt|gracelin: and 3NT in deeper trouble.|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@d should be a much better bid than 3@c imo|pg||
nt|psyck:  E intends this seq to show dobts about 3N|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, I agree with Tommy, East has better bid 3D instead of 3C last round.|pg||
nt|psyck:  i do agree that 3@d would have been preferable to 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh dear me |pg||
nt|panosk: wud have like 4 small spades vul |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H not best |pg||
nt|ssbux: can they stop in 3H?|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|kiwibridge: one day hopefully, we will put that to the test|pg||
nt|gracelin: Dekkers gets the message about doubt of 3NT.|pg||
nt|psyck:  W takes out 3N with no @c stop|pg||
nt|twcho: although 5@d needs careful handling to make|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: I only bid..look at the distribution....let pard know I have 3 @S  |pg||
nt|panosk: W cant acrually go higher, E might have KQ in @S|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h is a fair game-unlucky @c break beats it|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Thereis no point in playing negative doubles if East passes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if EW forgot what they were playing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|kemperg: no system against 1NT:(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@C by E and 2@D by W. |pg||
nt|andyv:  with 8 tricks off the top, this should be a nice pick up for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  W dbl, unless conventional, was ill advised.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a big Pass from East|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this could be expensive since EW don't have a game|pg||
nt|panosk: *actually|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have other forcing bids,  dbls etc |pg||
nt|twcho: ok, delayed @d|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, need almost double dummy to make.  Instead of ruffing 3rd round H, declarer need to ruff out SQ before playing K, and Q of trumps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: But as other room was -2 at 3NT, EW will not lose the board here, whatever the game they choose.|pg||
nt|twcho: but at least this line isn't impossible|pg||
nt|twcho: probably one round of trump first|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: E was too strong for 1NT anyway|pg||
nt|panosk: which wud be a waste|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s is doomed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: you are risking Spade 5-1 to protect H 7-1.  No declarer will find that double dummy play.|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer has a dilemma without solution|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: 3 losers and home.|pg||
nt|rv: yes in practise most partnerships will get to 4@h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: Many IMPs are lost by those who "compensate" for their underweight earlier actions by making non-systemic auction-ending passes later.|pg||
nt|andyv:  with dbl and michaels available, I wonder why S chose to bid such a raggedy suit|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|twcho: probably going for a finesse in trump now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|panosk: true|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: declarer is hopping north to have some 3-3-2-5 hands.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Especially when accompanied by those appealing black suits, the @H's look more like 4 than like a primary one-suiter.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|gracelin: so that she may lose only 1 trick each in S, D, and C.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: after this defense it is the 6-2 @s break in addn that defeats|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s9|nt|gracelin: now ruff a club and D|pg||
nt|twcho: but no entry to hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: why not small @C and duck by N.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: else declarer can take 2 @s ruffs in hand and make on dummy reversal?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ccba: France - netherland|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: France vs Netherlands in round 2 in about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|psridhar: Dekkers better not touch trumps now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16.15 local time, 10:15 CET, 9:15 UK, 18.15 Sydney|pg||
nt|rv: that could be precursor to potential Venice Cup SFs or even Finals:)|pg||
nt|rv: Dutch and France are 2 of the strongest nations in Ladies bridge|pg||
nt|psridhar: trump shift will enable declarer to ruff her @c with Ace aand pick up trumps for no loser |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|twcho: with the deadly @h break|pg||
nt|gracelin: if N is 3-3-2-5, declarer knock out DA and use H ruff to hand to clear trumps.|pg||
nt|twcho: since partner has discarded a @d|pg||
nt|twcho: so she must be in a position to ruff a @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: of course, with 6-2 in club, declarer knows she is doomed.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h7|nt|twcho: wow, make now|pg||
nt|gracelin: As I said, declarer is playing north to be 3-3-2-5 to have a chance to make.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|twcho: north shd be able to figure out the @d situation|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kerasidis: nice|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: I don't wonder why - obviously S wanted to show the 5 @H's right away and could X in later possibly - I just disagree w/it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I still wonder why|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
mc|10|nt|gracelin: did north miscounted clubs.  Partner cannot overriff S8 last time, so no chance for a trump promotion.|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: bidding weak suits in weak hands -3rd seat - not a gr8 idea|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: why not 2 @S? |pg||

nt|rnmalik: S would pull to 4@C or 3NT to play?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: favourable lead and all over.|pg||
nt|psridhar: weak hand = they are likely to win declaration probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: michaels |pg||

nt|loe48: well it was a marked stop as i dont like to see..but poor connection? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: May have been better take 1st @S trick here as @S blocked|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|loe48: but pretty much be the same as have entress anyways|pg||
nt|kerasidis: could even give the impression that he has Ajx in spdes :)'|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  if they played ELC, then N was on track to do just that (show the 2 suits)|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are doiing fine:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed to make the contract but timing of suit play  has to be good.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E only has 6 pts |pg||
pc|s4|nt|kemperg: duck and it goes of it own>)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that the X doesnt promise a bit more |pg||
nt|sybarra: from E |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: N's @S holding means S is not going to convert a X - and N not going to sit for @C's - so what is the point of X rather than a 2-suited bid that would surely slow S down?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: another big swing for Dutch here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: dealing with todays preempts means you sometimes have to lower the point requirements|pg||
nt|blewah: and they are minotities in this world of modern bidding|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|blewah: minorities|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|panosk: tough call i have no positive answer either|pg||
nt|sybarra: from my point of view,  the X would include k of @H's for example|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont think its enough for a X |pg||
nt|sybarra: now, if playing neg frees,  perhaps he bids 3 @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe with spade tolerance he can bid 3 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but that cuts the possible @H fit|pg||
nt|rv: inspite of unlucky slam deal for English ladies, Dutch women have definitely played more consistent bridge and deserve this victory|pg||
nt|twcho: so some more imps for Netherlands|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Something like what happened seems relatively foreseeable.|pg||
nt|andyv:  was S hand worth a 3@c bid with this vul?|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems bad but no problems now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even now makes.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: @D switch.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  with everyon play 2way new minor and xyz and pdq, etc....2@c has almost become non existent as a spot to play|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will have to be careful here not to lose 3@c tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: depends on  meaning of the dbl|pg||
nt|jcwla: We know from 14 that the double promises short @C's|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks everybody, g'night :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  gn Raija|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kemperg: bye Raija|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit early to go to sleep at half past 8 in the morning:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: In this case yes - other times may make a difference tempo wise|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's always hard and the 3@C was vul|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  S read the situation |pg||
nt|kemperg: easyer, no choices to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board of this set|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcwla: Nobody has weirder sleep times than Andy.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Jordan, I'm a greek living in los angeles...my hours are supposed to be messed up|pg||
nt|jcwla: On the 1@H overcall here that played opposite a stiff - in the CR NS played 4@S-1 and gained 7.|pg||
nt|andyv:  it could have been worse|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sputtering to a slowwwwwww close here.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: relaxed play to J@C.|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: had to be Q@S|pg||
nt|twcho: so another defensive error by north|pg||
mc|9|nt|kiwibridge: Q@S would have been a GREAT card|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: giving yourself an uppercut is always a nice feeling|pg||
