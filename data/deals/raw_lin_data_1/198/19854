nt|Walddk2: Not a great result for N-S|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 7 than 4|pg||

nt|bobholl: double or 2@C now as west ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|finch:  I think they must have had a bidding misunderstanding at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: likely to bid slam now that 2@c has been opened, one would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: X ok followed by 3@C ..as done|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  after a 2@C opening and a heart suit, North has a virtual slam force|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: 3@H should set the suit and ask for a cuebid|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3nt is gone as it was after they supported each other in @H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|finch:  the old-fashioned way to play is the 3@H asks for a first round control, responder bids 3NT with a king but no ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which it probably did|pg||
nt|jallerton: assuming 2@C was their strongest bid|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|finch:  with that understanding 3@S showed the ace|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|finch:  but with that understanding so did 5@C, so they may be cuebidding first or second|pg||
nt|finch:  redouble here will show first round club control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't he also bid 3NT with a singleton, Frances? Any second round control? I don't know Acol that well|pg||
nt|finch:  yes, sorry, 3NT with a second round control; cue with a first round control|pg||
nt|henryb:  As I played that, 3@s showed the @sA and no other ace. 4N would show two aces|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jallerton: In original Acol, you were supposed to make a positive on any hand with 2 aces|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jallerton: 5NT should show something extra but no further 2nd round control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to play, not so at the table|pg||
nt|bobholl: J would have been easier for P :)|pg||
nt|sommer: very lucky start for the young, nice ladies from Austria10 + 11 from "nowhere" (6@D was too hard)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, I thought I was in 7|pg||
nt|finch:  yes I think 6 isn't so hard|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suppose the right way to play this is @cA, @c ruff, @h, @c ruff, @d finesse|pg||
nt|finch:  not in 6 it isn't|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not?|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d ruff?|pg||
nt|finch:  the ace of diamonds might get ruffed off|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, making 7 is an imp|pg||
nt|henryb:  Once both opponents follow to three clubs and one heart, the probability of a stiff diamond becomes vanishingly small|pg||
nt|finch:  so you need it to be a smaller chance than 1 in 21 that there is a diamond ruff|pg||

nt|psyck: EW don't make too much in @s, so TD will likely ask them to play it out & then EW will let the score stand it it goes down|pg||
