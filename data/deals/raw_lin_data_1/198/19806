pc|d6|pc|c2|pg||

pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  good play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now @h ruff and @c ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bg: I agree with you Sveta I do not understand why many players will bid 1nt after 1 heart instead of 1 spade|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 4-3-3-3 split - quite OK, but this time...|pg||
nt|bg: just lead club to J and lead dia J|pg||
nt|kemperg: would have been interesting here:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may overruf, but has to play|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|kemperg: no defense any more|pg||

nt|kemperg: 4 now|pg||

nt|kemperg: but 6 is normal bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but they have to discover their might|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kemperg: modern bidding by EW, 2@D as switch|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  no way - it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|kemperg: N on the brink of an invite|pg||
nt|kemperg: I couldn't|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - grand relied of a finess of trump K - isn't the good one|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl lokking for a better suit then @H?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  or the team match pressure worked? it seems so|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @S finesse now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after this lead he will play spades from top|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and after this start, @sK is going to take the trick - declarer may be afraid of @d ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bg: good decision by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hot start|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H competitive, dbl = invite|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bg: aggressive E might have been better off trying 2 dia instead of 2 hearts showing 10 points or so sure spade support is weak but the alternative of 2 Hearts led them too high|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, even 2 tricks in @s for NS become problematic|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sfoxa:  agree - distribution encourages|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  yes, W could be hardly blamed for his 3@h bid - E may well have an ace more|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|pc|d7|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|h6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: what would be 3@d instead of 3@h ? isnt like better /weak support with heart fit ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this agreement suits well to the situation|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and a lot of pairs playing opps suit as maximum (passed or bid) hand with fit|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|bg: good thought but depends on partnership understanding Engine and caboose have to be on same track|pg||
