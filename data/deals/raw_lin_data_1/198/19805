nt|bobholl: good guess i guess :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: muddled thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: cANT DELETE MOOVIE RESULTS FROM SESJ 1.|pg||
nt|penseur9: action now|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be but we might be surprised|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|roswolf: 6@C would be cute |pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be trappy for n/s|pg||
nt|rodal f: A stolen spot?|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes... 2 loosers NS|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: players seem to be very conservative on vugraph|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: but unlucky if n/s inspired|pg||
nt|rv: I will go down in 6@s, will play for @SQ inside|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11H=@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobholl: 6@S is best pairs contract but will / migth fail|pg||

nt|rodal f: Bewtten|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Better|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes, understandable :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: good time to have a bidding misunderstanding|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H=@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have bid 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bvdahl: small @d lead...? :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: BUT too high|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: East has splinter option available in 2 suits, hence decided to just raise to 3@c and await developments|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: or continuation....|pg||
nt|penseur9: sneaky Baard :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: do you have 2 trump queens and 6 aces in this sequence ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead of @SA is logical here|pg||
nt|rv: normally when folks have fit in 2 suits, they play RKC for major even if minor fit was agreed first|pg||
nt|rv: a few others play DKC (double key card blackwood) where there are 6 aces (kings of both suits) and 2 queens|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: Esplin by E|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's 3@S BID HAS PAINTED A PICTURE|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Belive others also would lead @D here, but fatal.|pg||

nt|roswolf: i might have a wager on e/w for the event|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might get murky|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Don't think anyone will do it. Should be a very standard score|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Nice to see u all specs and Andre - Bård Vidar - Geooffrey:)|pg||

mb|5D|nt|rv: prefer natural 1@h by East instead of masterminding auction with 1n|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass can NEVER be right|pg||
nt|penseur9: Hi Frank... welcome|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Interesting hand. 10 tricks NS in @h's and probably 11 EW in @d|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: this could get murky|pg||
nt|rodal f: Trying to go for a posible better spot.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzkn: NS in doubt.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks an unnecessary think by north -passing would be a HUGE VIEW as would 3nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: Are still thinking.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: 8 @h tricks and 2 @s's|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: but perhaps well-timed |pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: is this match being telecast on a delayed basis, we seem to have all scores in movie already:)|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|rv: don't like East's pass of 1@s with 6 hcp and doubleton @s to boot|pg||
nt|roswolf: the website for the event is http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/0219/2011-09-03-foss1.htm|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: East @ST is crucial for game, that is only sure entry for taking @h finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: south doubles?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|rodal f: Hard for NS to come in now|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|roswolf: north passed - ye gods that is a pysche where i come from|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: definitely south being conservative|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4@s = looks normal. Maybe someone will make a bad sac in @h's EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi SS, close match|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ssbux: China team start coming in the middle of the second segment|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's double showed 4+ of spade, and when West bid 3D he denied 3-card spade.  So 3S now is 2-card aalso seeking H stopper for 3NT|pg||
nt|ssbux: Indonesia team found their best denomination but may be 1 level too high|pg||
nt|gracelin: East of course cannot bid 3NT, he will probably pass 3S if he trust his partner's bidding|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: this should help declarer and West should trot up his contract now|pg||
nt|roswolf: for what it is worth -assuming 4nt natural with extras -east should pass because of the void heart|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h6|nt|roswolf: holding this to 8 tricks should be a good score|pg||
nt|roswolf: -3 looks likely now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rv: Johnson (North) was possibly afraid of threat of @c suit in dummy, once South returned a @s he should have realised that @cs are bottled-up|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: for China, I meant|pg||
nt|rv: this deal would be fairly boring at IMPs, holds plenty of promise at MPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: srry, it's Indonesia already bid and made 7S, so it's up to the China to tie the board|pg||

nt|roswolf: 2@d=?|pg||

pc|h3|nt|gracelin: that's 13 imps to Indonesia to close the gap a bit.  |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence lost a tempo|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup didnt go for gold|pg||

pc|d2|nt|rv: if West had bid 2@s to show 5@h+5m, East might have still have bid 3n|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well bidded|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w brush their opps aside|pg||
nt|geot: Hi, a normal 4@S, making 4 or 5 depending on the spade guess|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: west should have passed imo|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rv: yes agree, if he had to bid I prefer 2@s especially if it is played as split range|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi Geo:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi geo|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|gracelin: I may try 3Nt with the West hand, his hand is very No trump oriented |pg||
nt|roswolf: effectively he psyched and deserves a poor score|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rv: 2@s is less of a distortion than 2@h|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|geot: Hi:) may be tempting to play for the king to drop, but the best way to play the spades isolated is to finesse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: ok we play 3nt there are some chunky intermediates|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|roswolf: true but it is still too rich for my stomach|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: East will settle for 8 tricks and not go more down|pg||
nt|geot: South can win 2@S. East has to duck first diamond to prevent +140 N/S|pg||
nt|geot: sometimes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: but there are not enough fast tricks|pg||
nt|penseur9: looks like -1 |pg||

nt|roswolf: but soth in the tank -what can he be thinking about?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|gracelin: south's trump shift is trying to find out whether he has a trump winner to help him decide the course for defense|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|rv: West in pre-balancing situation on South's 2@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is this? this guarantees a bottom|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzkn: sry 3 down:(|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: yes but it is hard to judge how this will compare with other tables|pg||
nt|rv: my preferred aucton 1@s-p-1n-p-2@s, now West will get in with 2n to show 2 places to play or @h+minor|pg||

nt|roswolf: difference|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: red card|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: exactly the same bidding in both rooms|pg||

pc|h7|nt|roswolf: and now n/s have found their best contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all.|pg||
nt|rv: North's hand not suitable for defense and I might have bid 2@d instead of passing redouble in earlier round of bidding|pg||
nt|geot: Good lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|geot: only two heart losers in 4@S, the diamond loser should disappear on the clubs |pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: south in the jacuzzi|pg||
pc|s5|nt|geot: If declarer takes the club finesse (remember, East made the t/o double) he will go down|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer imitates the rueful rabbit and bolts for home - great guardian angel|pg||
nt|roswolf: heh!?|pg||
nt|geot: oh well, this is a good one for E/W, for sure|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: What would u do at S cards?|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|penseur9: T/O was ok but 2NT ????|pg||
nt|penseur9: looks like -2 here|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Bit strange the W @C drop.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: I suspect North will not take another @c finesse:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well -2 should be 80% of the mps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: this is x-rated play - the guardian angel should get hazard pay|pg||
nt|geot: I think South was a bit soft, yes. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: what!?|pg||
nt|geot: Why would not declarer take another finesse in clubs? |pg||
nt|roswolf: well east would show out|pg||
nt|roswolf: magical mystery tour|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: 3 down after d dec risked c- finesse!|pg||
nt|geot: if it was 3 down, declarer must have taken another finesse in clubs early|pg||
nt|geot: can we blame him? the first finesse held, he is playing MP? |pg||
nt|rv: North could have settled for 10 tricks since he already got a bonus trick once opps didn't lead @hs, also @c7 should be suspicious|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the guardian angel got bored it seems - greed doesnt pay - but a double grosvenor coup is a bit special i suppose|pg||
nt|geot: I see your point Venky, but......that is so easy to say when we see West ducked the first club|pg||
nt|rv: another aspect North didn't consider if East had 4@cs, West will have 1 or both 4M and would have bid 1M|pg||
nt|rv: West's pass of redouble is an important aspect for North to consider in play|pg||
nt|rv: in addition to @C7 lead as well as non @h lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think we should draw a veil over that hand to protect the guilty|pg||
nt|rodal f: The pairs playing is....    But miss the result page. http://home.online.no/ svenpran/2011-09-03-foss1.htm?Resultatside=home.online.no%2F svenpran%2F2011-09-03-foss1.htm|pg||

nt|geot: Must be almost all the MPs for E/W, as even partscores in spades beat +50|pg||
nt|roswolf: INDEED|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: Still Aarebrekk- Uran NS and good old friends from Ski BC EV. :)|pg||
nt|geot: On the last board the 4@D bid was a winner, in a way, but I think North would have passed 3@S.. so it gave South another chance really|pg||
nt|geot: on the other hand, West did not really think N/S was cold for 5@S after this bidding, so 4@D was maybe fair enough...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: but dbl gets all the marbles|pg||

nt|roswolf: anything could happen here - 4@HX?|pg||

nt|roswolf: erupt|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is a lady?|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes... NS in 1st and EW in 3rd|pg||
nt|rodal f: A funny board EW|pg||
nt|penseur9: no problem Tore|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rodal f: A new funny board.|pg||
nt|geot: N/S will make only 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzkn: wk2|pg||
nt|roswolf: A GOOD WEAK2?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|geot: not a bad one:)|pg||
nt|penseur9: sorry EW in 4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: many Norwegian pairs play 8-11|pg||
nt|penseur9: this looks like a standard 4@H NS here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: 3nt perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west should dbl - this is our hand pard|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes also 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|geot: 2@C Drury would be ok here, then simply 4@S from South|pg||
nt|geot: 3@D is minisplinter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any for a X at W|pg||
nt|penseur9: lucky for EW that N bid here|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3H to come|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is trapping|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: singelton, but usually four card trump support|pg||
nt|rodal f: pliter and que from N and S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2|pg||
nt|penseur9: good call Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond lead puts pressure on declarer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|penseur9: last card I would have guessed for the lead :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@C que as well|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Vugraphzkn: EW: Rune Hauge- Anna Malinowski maybe do nt need any presentation! Both are experienced players at top nasjonal level, Rune also as football promoter (skill both in head and legs ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: LOL). Anna is playing on the norw lady team. Obtained a 6. award in mix- team at Lillehammer.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|penseur9: funny, it seems that 4@S makes here|pg||
nt|roswolf: does east suspect trumps are 3-0|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gracelin: Shi got himself into trouble with the double, even if he escapes a double, opponents inj 3NT will locate the DQ.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|geot: If West leads the @D10 slam will roll home....|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: when south didn't open in 3rd hand, North should admit that the hand belongs to the opponents.|pg||
nt|rodal f: New invit for slam by S|pg||
nt|geot: What is 3@S? well, agreement stuff, forcing or not. I prefer forcing.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree but not here i think|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|gracelin: declarer better ducks this|pg||
nt|geot: but South is asking for the trump Q, North says no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, asking for @SQ|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|gracelin: this will be a battle between -1 and -2 with the letter more likely, unless East rises SQ now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|roswolf: well missing 2 keycards this is to be expected|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr.U are right|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|geot: Should go two down. E/W in 4H has only three top losers, may get tapped in trumps, but still do all all right. Would have been an interesting challenge |pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Are EW underdugs at this table?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: declarer still could go off here|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: What is the different by 3@H trancfere and 3@S color?|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|geot: So only one down, and I cant see that being a bad board for N/S|pg||
nt|roswolf: nor can i|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: Ab 3.05 next session- start|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|c4|nt|geot: She could have ruffed the two diamonds, and made the contract when the trumps are friendly|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: or set up the hearts|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|gracelin: -1 for 7 imps.|pg||

nt|roswolf: may not score as badly as it looks|pg||
nt|rodal f: u mean 15.05 CET?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Made a good contract by the start|pg||

nt|penseur9: about time :))))|pg||
mb|1N|nt|penseur9: yes very|pg||
nt|roswolf: super slam|pg||
nt|penseur9: but som pairs will be in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|gracelin: unfortunately for Indonesia, the last board can create little swing.  The closed room result of 3D -1 seems normal.|pg||
nt|geot: I think it will score badly, many routes to 11|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: best minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a heavy weak2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: even a grand is possible in @C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodal f: A nice spot but some problems |pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a hard hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: TRUE BUT THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE SOUND|pg||
nt|penseur9: 2@D= no 4 card major|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: YES MAY WELL END UP IN 7NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzkn: H= s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a haqrd hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: even if declarer takes all 13 tricks, if wont be enough.  Guess we can congratulate China CNPC for winning this championships.|pg||
nt|roswolf: here it will rest|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzkn: Tomorrow is time for Gulasj distributions!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: 15 versus 17 is essentially worth a slam investugation - the players may be tired|pg||
pc|s8|nt|geot: Spade or a diamond lead? I dont mind leading from the five card suit after this bidding.|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like declarer must pick the hearts|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|penseur9: ok great Tore|pg||

nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: the grand can be made dd but in practice should go down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|geot: because of the @H7 there are some reasons to play hearts the other way....but on the other hand, South is likely to have diamond lenght,so....|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bvdahl: Will have to cash @hA and run all the minor winners. IF @sJ falls or is together with KQ of @h's the contract makes|pg||

nt|rodal f: WD Ana|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt all pass?|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm north taking a solo flight!?|pg||
nt|geot: wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: are they really playing 4 card majors?|pg||
nt|penseur9: surprising 4 card major opening here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: friendly lay-out in clubs, so even with two heart losers 4@H may have some play|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: imo that is a poor lead at mps|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is silly how can you miss a 5-4 fit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|geot: in teams this would have been a not so terrible 4@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Anyway it seems as NS will get a score up here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: west contemplating his options all bad|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|geot: I like Karlberg as player, he is very good, but I dont like his 2@S here|pg||
