nt|jallerton: the play in 3NT will be faster|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  Shows the effect of pre-empting, it made West decide to force to game (quite reasonably)|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|henryb:  That is a Very forcing NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|pc|h4|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: it's either forcing or it isn't|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: :)  Henry loves that debate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I had it with him the other day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I claim that thereis no such thing as semi-forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but most who play forcing NT do not include game forces in the bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either a bid is forcing or it is not|pg||
nt|finch:  semi-forcing NT is about as meaningful as grand slam force (which at least is forcing!)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bob Holl|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: I disagree. If you don't include any game forces in your 1NT response then why play it as forcing?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s2|pc|d5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: I asked Henry if a woman can be semi-pregnant. He did not reply. Either she is or she is not, period.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|dT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|finch:  Declarer has a difficult problem on the club back|pg||
nt|finch:  he might need the finesse for his 9th trick, but if the majors come in and East has the @CK he's just off by finessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: yeah but no diffrent which card to play here:) lucky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Forcing 1N was originally used to allow invitational hands to bid 1N rather than at the two level, and facilitate 2/1 gf|pg||
nt|finch:  I wonder what declarer can infer from West winning the first spade with the queen and the second with the 10|pg||
nt|finch:  what holdings would do that?|pg||
nt|jallerton: KQ10 and KQ104|pg||
nt|finch:  or as has just be suggested to me, someone with the @CK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think if E had the @ck he would have returned the @d2|pg||
nt|finch:  there are plenty of positions where you just don't bother given suit preference without an ace|pg||
nt|finch:  and this is one of them|pg||
nt|jallerton: @s 3-3 seems more likely than @s4-2 with both rounded suits coming in|pg||
nt|finch:  why would East want to help declarer by showing whether or not he has the @CK?|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: stil thinking|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|baardolav: Yes... and find the @d Q. 6@h is doomed|pg||

mb|p|nt|pauleger: why not 3@d? You still can bid 3NT afterwards|pg||
nt|baardolav: not sure if they open 1@d on 2344 so west know of only 8card @d fit|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|pauleger: Now W asks for @dQ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not a great result for N-S|pg||
nt|finch:  admittedly not very likely, but an extra chance|pg||
mb|1H|an|!|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 7 than 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hii Roland, Bob an Povl and all kibs...welcome all....:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: double or 2@C now as west ?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch:  I think they must have had a bidding misunderstanding at the other table|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jallerton: likely to bid slam now that 2@c has been opened, one would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: X ok followed by 3@C ..as done|pg||
mb|3S|nt|finch:  after a 2@C opening and a heart suit, North has a virtual slam force|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@H should set the suit and ask for a cuebid|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3nt is gone as it was after they supported each other in @H|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|finch:  the old-fashioned way to play is the 3@H asks for a first round control, responder bids 3NT with a king but no ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which it probably did|pg||
nt|jallerton: assuming 2@C was their strongest bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  with that understanding 3@S showed the ace|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|finch:  but with that understanding so did 5@C, so they may be cuebidding first or second|pg||
nt|finch:  redouble here will show first round club control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't he also bid 3NT with a singleton, Frances? Any second round control? I don't know Acol that well|pg||
nt|finch:  yes, sorry, 3NT with a second round control; cue with a first round control|pg||
nt|henryb:  As I played that, 3@s showed the @sA and no other ace. 4N would show two aces|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|jallerton: In original Acol, you were supposed to make a positive on any hand with 2 aces|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5NT should show something extra but no further 2nd round control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to play, not so at the table|pg||
nt|bobholl: J would have been easier for P :)|pg||
nt|sommer: very lucky start for the young, nice ladies from Austria10 + 11 from "nowhere" (6@D was too hard)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, I thought I was in 7|pg||
nt|finch:  yes I think 6 isn't so hard|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suppose the right way to play this is @cA, @c ruff, @h, @c ruff, @d finesse|pg||
nt|finch:  not in 6 it isn't|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not?|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d ruff?|pg||
nt|finch:  the ace of diamonds might get ruffed off|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, making 7 is an imp|pg||
nt|henryb:  Once both opponents follow to three clubs and one heart, the probability of a stiff diamond becomes vanishingly small|pg||
nt|finch:  so you need it to be a smaller chance than 1 in 21 that there is a diamond ruff|pg||

nt|vugraphzna: small break here|pg||
nt|jallerton: Blame whoever invented the "law" of total tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2S|an|!|nt|finch:  South has plenty of ways to show a strong spade raise here, so 3@S is a nice semi-preemptive call|pg||
mb|3D|an|!h|nt|bobholl: n derves a 4@H bid now :(|pg||
nt|sommer: inventive 1NT, but how did 4@S go 2 down??|pg||
nt|bobholl: deserves|pg||
mb|3S|nt|finch:  North still has much the same problem, with 7 of the things|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jallerton: North does have 3 extra spades, and his only side card in partner's suit. Tough not to bid 5@s here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|finch:  ace of clubs, AK of hearts on which West shows a doubleton, heart ruffed high, spade finesse?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobholl: @H lead @D underlead @H ruff is only 1 down so i don't understand either|pg||

nt|baardolav: anyone open 1nt in north hand?|pg||
nt|psyck: usually jumps cues are mixed raise in competition, but he did not have room to jump here :)|pg||

mc|13|nt|baardolav: testing spade first... and then if it does not brake... diamond ace in front of the king without the last spade... and then @h 3-3 or a @S @h squeeze vs west|pg||
nt|vugraphzkf: that was the last board of this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzkf: hope you have enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|pauleger: not the best line I think, @s to the K, @s to the A, if @ss are 3-1, lead a @d up and if E takes the A you still have squeezing chances in the majors against W|pg||
