nt|peachy: Lively looking hand to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||

nt|panosk: hi Gary|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcwla: This must be a very light 3rd seat 1@D by S?|pg||
nt|jcwla: If this auction is to make any sense?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or do we just have it all wrong?|pg||
nt|rv: South will double this, could be phantom save though|pg||
nt|andyv:  do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@Sis a two-suiter, known as Muiderberg in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|zhoufly: µÚ¶þÂÖ±ÈÈü¿ªÊ¼ÁË|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: Routine 4@S for NS.|pg||
nt|panosk: double is support i guess meaning 3hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with all bidding, a good stop, looks like just a make|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4333 in E not very appealing |pg||
nt|panosk: redouble probably honor in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes bet so panos|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi kibitzers and operator :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although a heart lead would have beaten it|pg||

nt|psyck:  This is generally played as invitational' sequence|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will not accept any invitation|pg||
pc|dK|nt|panosk: yes gd stop indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both pairs play 5-card majors, 2/1 responses are not GF|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck:  generally as 5+ card @s any inv hand, some also play it as 4+card @s inv hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Would you all bid 5@C at love all?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcwla: There are no words for my view on this 1@D opening.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Andy, no sleep:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: but 1 off|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Germ...how was breakfast?|pg||
nt|kemperg: fine ty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|psyck:  If W had a hand to accept inv, I assume E's plan was to say correct 3N to 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  Spec an listen to the voice commentary if using the browser version|pg||
nt|psyck:  *specs can...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this event is an 8 teams comptition after round 1 France with 25 vp is leading Sweden23 end netherlands 22  then come the 2 chinese teams england usa and canada|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|rv: not me with especially with @SQJX|pg||
nt|twcho: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|psridhar: the idea behind opening thaat E hand was the shape, but Larsson chickened out |pg||
pc|d6|nt|ssbux: it is also common in this part of the world, but usually 55|pg||
nt|jcwla: Something about rather trying to take 3 tricks than 11.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or even 4.|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes too much defensive value|pg||
nt|rv: I will take my medicine (even if fixed) and choose to quietly defend 4@s|pg||
nt|chnjcc:  åä½å¥½|pg||
nt|jcwla: This opening is so cheesy, really deserved a worse fate but the pressure bid pays off this time.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|panosk: re hi, slight connection error apparently|pg||
nt|rv: North might struggle to make even 9 tricks in @s strain|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: So joanna neve sit south and Danielle gaviard North|pg||
nt|peachy: heart lead is by NO MEANS obvious or even necessarily a good choice|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Fiona needs to drive out the A@C and get to dummy with a heart and lead up to the J@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|twcho: After 1st round, France is the leading team with 25 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: yes|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: standings can  be reached on bbo  programm of vu graph|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N a passed hand so likely a pass by S and it is.|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Even that is not necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kathrine is married to Swedish star Peter Bertheau|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|peachy: Majority of Chinese players play Precision or similar strong club system|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  I wonder if NS have a way to treat 5-5 in majors when they open 1N|pg||
pc|cK|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: Welcome back everybody. Here is the link to the tournament website with list of teams, running score/results and other info|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||
nt|sybarra: chinese commentary in closed room  english here|pg||
nt|psridhar: in general +180 on 20-20 deal should not be bad...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: We have different definitions of "just barely there."|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even on a heart lead South has to win the first club and play another one|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E may just bid game here|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D seem plausible here|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: shaky hand   South have the points  East the distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and S will have hard time ignoring the 6 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h or 4@s will make|pg||
nt|twcho: I believe EW is playing 5 card M with 1C including all bal hand outside NT range|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Henry, alway happy to have you join us|pg||
nt|peachy: Even if W had much less than she does, it is valuable interference after they open 1D, to overcall 2C.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it would be the Swedish equivalent to Gazzilli, named Häxan (the witch)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in 4@h, you don't have to worry as much about the Q@s.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=VeniceCup&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards%2F2011Veldhoven   for ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: convention cards|pg||
nt|rv: West will drive to game here, first bid 2@c as good raise in @h and then maybe bid and rebid @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/Netherlands/dekkers-michielson.pdf|pg||
nt|peachy: Many pairs, even experienced or experts, have trouble in the auction after that start|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although some may have doubled i prefer 2@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have bid 3@d as W, or started with double|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming 3@d means "bid 3N with a stopper, otherwise do something intelligent"|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a nice spot for EW.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: they played 4 @H's making in closed room |pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
nt|jcwla: This pace is glacial.|pg||
nt|andyv:  watch out Jordan...they're moving faster and faster|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, but then come the undos -- no new bids, just an alert.|pg||
nt|rv: important system aspect for partnerships to discuss? 3@c could potentially show both majors with longer OM (@s here)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E trying to slow the train down|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think EW in CR are going to have a chat about this auction.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has a 3 loser hand...they should reach game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should 2@S not be forcing on the auction in the closed room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it is not, you have to bid 4@H over 1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Only on this planet, Roland, not on several others.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 2@C followed by something|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kemperg: wise to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...500-800 certainly possible in 5@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was -3 in the CR so still gains 3 imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd have a hard time bidding with the E hand on that aucition in the CR...only 100% force to cue bid and then bid @s|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi all!|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi pano!|pg||
nt|loe48: Hi Dennis welcome :)|pg||
nt|panosk: even 7 @D is makeable as card lie but i doubt they will get there|pg||
nt|psridhar: N was close to a take out X in terms of shape but light on values and RED|pg||
nt|jcwla: And opp a passed pd - nothing to protect.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||
nt|andyv:  E here decides to show the @c stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W decides to dive off the deep end|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the best spot  is reached by West|pg||
nt|psyck:  With a hand unable to show @d's later, I'd prefer to open 1@d & rebid @c|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: last set was 44-39 heaps of imps traded|pg||
nt|jcwla: To quote "Miracle Mile," What's the hurry, Harry?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will make with no problem losing 4 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: K&R has that last S hand at a generous 8.6: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ83+Q2+873+Q973 |pg||
nt|panosk: now secured , the friendly lie that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the difference between 6@H now and 6@H over1?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: will likely duck on sp  |pg||
nt|sybarra: *duck one |pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: I am not surprosed, it looked like a 7 count at first glance|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT seems like the field resting spot here.|pg||
nt|peachy: *surprised|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi aria|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she might as well have bid 6@H directly|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps less likely to make now?|pg||
nt|ssbux: why 3C, either 2c or 4c will be better and not misleading as notrump probe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  this looks more scientific, Roland...esp. when her partner showed her useful values in the @c suit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||

nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: hello patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Jean-Paul and Tommy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: a decent save non-vul here as 4@H easy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: I am guessing that W took 3NT to show the high end of a 1@H-response in values.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panosk: redouble showing 1st round control in @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: operator are rooms connecting |pg||
nt|twcho: hi Shirley and Raija|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: at these colours asking for too much. pass the right decision.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice auction|pg||
nt|kerasidis: very usufull....|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately game not reached CR|pg||
nt|panosk: gd lead to try to defeat, spade is no use since auction revealed singleton opposite A|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psridhar: South might still have considered balancing 1@H -pd may bid some NT and wont be disappointed with the dummy-but when a fit exists.....|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panosk: even possible void (3@S)|pg||
nt|ssbux: Hi Patrick, will be seeing you playing next week|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes, bd 1 is a push, CR playing same boards as us|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: instead of gaining the sacrifice loses 7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi rashed|pg||
nt|twcho: the Netherlands has gained 8 imps from 1st bd|pg||
nt|gracelin: The prize money in this Hua-Yuen Cup totalled US$200,000 which exceeds the Yeh"s Cup.|pg||
nt|sybarra: you may want to ask operator in chinese,  if rooms are connected |pg||
nt|jcwla: Slightly unusual def and decl play but nothing much at stake there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: N doubled 5@H so defence was easy in 6@S in closed room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes I think they are|pg||
nt|twcho: This tournament is the one that offers the highest prize money for Women bridge players ever|pg||
nt|psridhar: as cards are however, NS havent lost anything |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|jcwla: A nice third-seat weak 2 if available.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a slam I'd rather be in|pg||
nt|sybarra: Star-studded international field. Click on  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You are unlucky if you go down in 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you will with both finesses off|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|andyv:  trick is for NS to stay low |pg||
nt|rv: red blooded pre-empt by Marion Michielsen|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: board one was plyed in1 NT doubled and made in CR|pg||
nt|gracelin: The 8 teams will share a pool of US$150,000 in the teams.  Another US$50,000 for the pairs.|pg||
nt|twcho: the prize money is enviable for men. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: The total prize money is US$200,000|pg||
nt|sybarra: teams from all over the world|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not 1NT by West before you may wonder. Because they play a 14-16 NT, a popular range in Sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: On the cards and S's opening, 6@H is not an outre spot on 2, but the best-bid hand award awaits further nominations.|pg||
nt|rv: what is 4@d here by Smith, some play it as good raise in @Cs, a few others play it as both majors|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer to play 4@d as both majors 5-5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E has a solid road here, showing @S and forcing now, can show the @H later.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|sybarra: if S bids his hearts.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@S denies a 4-card major|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ianmcc: partial for N/S but they could get higher|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c bergen I think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: par contract in 5 in a minor for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, they have very generous sponsors in this Hua Yuen Women Elite Cup|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would much rather have four counts all day than these 10- and 11-counts where you start to get your engine revved up and then shut it down.|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing Trf responses to 1@C opening that 1@s shows @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@D misguided in third seat.  It's their hand - put some pressure on.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now, let's talk about this double -- or the lack of a double by the N hand in similar situations.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats what i call trump support |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and does, finally a 10 point opener gets a good result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beegen raise I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bergen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and shows diamonds. 3@H a splinter|pg||
nt|psridhar: and 3@H =self splinter |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|blewah: and S decided he likes his hand a lot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C was bergen as I look at it and S upgraded his hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need this trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D Ace and @H back:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT is probably a sort of Lebensold to start a weak bid.|pg||
nt|twcho: with the winner taking 30,000|pg||
nt|twcho: and the last team will still have 12,000|pg||
nt|paulhac:  There are three events closely following each other this one, Beijing and Tianjin the later two being open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Over a more natural 1@C-1@D-1NT auction, E also could bid 3@H to pinpoint the concern.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Anybody have a problem with 3@D?|pg||
nt|rv: this slam is worse than 1 of 2 finesses, if @h finesse is off chances are not very bright|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally a splinter bid supports partner -a form of raise; but a self splinter suggests a good long suit that doesnt need much support + stiff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West promised a balanced hand, so East knows there's a fit and can splinter for diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the 4 matches going on in round  4 at: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=4&tourid=1174|pg||
nt|psridhar: borderline but we can see 3N is right here- West's 3@s will steer them away i expect|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, those intermediate @H spots come into play and though 3@S is thoughtful, it may give E no choice.|pg||
nt|psridhar: E may even think slam now|pg||
nt|psridhar: useful black cards |pg||
nt|jcwla: E would probably want a second @S honor to bid 4@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is Q986 enough to go for 3NT? Borderline|pg||
nt|psridhar: how would W bid @S AQXX,@H JXXX, @D QX, @C AXX ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ssbux: are they playing Lebansohl after a reversed|pg||
nt|psridhar: In my experience bidding 3N with a stopper of sorts AND length = u wont go wrong often|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the defense should be pretty easy as long as W doesn't get overly anxious and cashes out early|pg||
nt|ssbux: another unlucky slam for EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's all coming up orange so far.|pg||
nt|rv: still very decent slam just on @h finesse|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes very decent, but unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: looks like -1 again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep   could be -2 if they can get second ruff |pg||
nt|panosk: @D2 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd ruff = the same 2 trump tricks he started with?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 Nt is aking to go back to 3 @c in first stage|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and  last !!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: You and your favorite partner need to have agreement on what it means: does it ask for a @D lead (so that if you don't double you are suggesting a different lead) or does it say "I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: have a 2@D rebid that they stole"?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Plenty of room for both major K's to be in N, let alone just the @HK.|pg||
nt|twcho: is this common method played in France?|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd in the end the swedes !|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: if @h finesse is off, you need @s finesse on and black suit squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk2: perhaps 3NT should show stiff J or 10|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: north, with a little extra, may consider to take action other than 3C, but she has a boarderline hand. |pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: atleast 55% or so |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes   perhaps  South was not  very optimistec   it  not such a bad slam!!|pg||
nt|paulhac:  All are 8 team tournaments|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcwla: I prefer the latter meaning and trust that pd will lead my suit in the absence of a clearly better alternative; however, I do have some pds who require the double if I want the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: lead of that suit.|pg||
nt|peachy: Again, remembering Precision context|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|panosk: bad break in trumps 4@H had no chance gd game though|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D isnt simple support in @D must be 2way checkback with game forc hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  at 50 a pop, down 1 or 2 shouldn't make much difference as it's almost impossible to stop in 2@s or 2@h with the NS hand|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: probably another push |pg||
nt|ssbux: ten of D, signal for S?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|panosk: for more info check this link http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TwoWayCheckback.html|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @d would be easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a hand of various judgments where each bid sort of means what its bidder wanted to mean at the time.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Exactly, Roland.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: good unblock N after his good lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: now 2@H and still a @D to lose|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 3@S could have been a slightly better suit, the 3NT could have been a slightly better stiff, 4@D presumably would be forcing (but was there an ounce of fear that maybe it would ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: be passed), 4@S would likely have shown a slightly better second @S card, and on and on.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: Paul, I think you will be joining the Open events|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: Right - here, it is clearly showing @D length.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was a horrid contract created by E|pg||
nt|rnmalik: True, Aces needed for upgradation.|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is enroute to china now |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unless|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|pc|hK|nt|twcho: still they are NV so south no need to push so hard|pg||
nt|gracelin: south does have only one Q and 2 Jacks, but his minor suit fit plus a H shortage maybe enough to find a game invitation bid.|pg||
mc|10|nt|paulhac:  Tianjin only but my sons are playing in Beijing also|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: Tianjin's event is of higher prize money. :)|pg||

nt|panosk: absolutely|pg||
nt|sybarra: S coming in?  and how best?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should die at 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which could have been horribly wrong if West had weaker hearts|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: Exactly|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this lies badly for N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly, Jordan|pg||
nt|psridhar: that auction is highly desirable often Roland -but this deal i admire the auction by the Swedes|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: this is the best way if you play it  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C must be conventional for majors?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nicola Smith and Sally Brock are very experienced, so they will get on with life and not let these results affect them|pg||
nt|rv: luck does even out in long tourney, British ladies should be resilient here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The first part score battle|pg||
nt|sybarra: you sort of want to open N hand dont you?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: Precision NS then Raija?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW don't have enough to compete at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kerasidis: dont like emmediate 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: North's 1n shows 18-19 here|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally 9 tricks are available for N-S with lucky lie of red suits|pg||
nt|twcho: depends on the overall opening bid structure|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: The bridge Championship is being played at Shenzen, a beautiful city adjacent to Hongkong. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: catching up the scores now|pg||
nt|panosk: yes that was the threat but how can he know club honors not divided|pg||
nt|kerasidis: as it could be with weaker habnds|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hands|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 3@c maybe|pg||
nt|kemperg: did not know that, but @H had no use|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|kerasidis: there are partners with great aggrements with such hands...2@c or 3@c|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi carl|pg||
nt|ssbux: as I said previously, it is unusally to start with same boards when directed by Anthony|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If I was green I might be tempted|pg||
nt|sybarra: it just feels like a "good" hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  everyone wiling to play 1N except the author of the bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will be fortunate to go down 1|pg||
nt|ssbux: very lucky 3NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone for 2@H opening in fourth chair?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: n/S being talked out of good spot in @S's|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: confirmed by a spec, thx|pg||
nt|peachy: I really do not have any first hand knowledge, but looks like Precision|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C shows more high cards indeed so in case EW go to 5 level N doent have a clue about pards hand|pg||
nt|loe48: many use 2nt as good raise in this pos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Carl|pg||
nt|loe48: invite + in spade|pg||
nt|panosk: with the 4@S bid that is, agree with Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes many alternative bids...depends on partners aggrements|pg||
nt|kemperg: to much in @C nothing in red suits, 4@S good for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't this the hand for it?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|panosk: N was a bit conservative for me shud have tried 2 spades|pg||
nt|rv: anyone open 2n (20-21) with North hand, what does K-R say?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Michielsen showing 18-19 balanced with her 1NT|pg||
nt|twcho: south is conservative not to overcall|pg||
nt|gracelin: the winner of the 8-team competiton will take home US$30,000 and the  8 also has US$12,000.  At moment, France is leading after one match and the Dutch is lying 3rd.|pg||
nt|twcho: probably deterred by the spot cards she held|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: @d most likely, will cost a trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Ns   remained silence with 25  hpc |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 12-15 with 6 or some such|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I suspect K-R will show more than 19 hcp for North hand, possibly not enough for 2n opening|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  A@h and @h|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes shape and values suit 2@H opening -but some authorites feel the hand should not have > 4 controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards not lying well for Heather Dhondy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well that @C9 ain't bad.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must still lose 2 hearts, 1 diamond and 1 club|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: 20.45 per KR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And can easily go 2 down|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|peachy: This event does not have website or any other information online|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S made on 3 so an early 12 imps to HuaChu|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@s probably denies M|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ssbux: with a passed partner, no convenient bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW need to dodge the @s @d squeeze|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: oh oh  hope we are not losing it again  |pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes Shirley|pg||
pc|c6|nt|twcho: Paul, do you know about EW bidding system?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: however can't beat 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: one of those hands that cries out for a trump lead|pg||
nt|loe48: but..as crazy cards can be..opponents may have contract too..so 4s is also blocking alot same it can make|pg||
nt|twcho: and the double indicates @s suit|pg||
nt|peachy: The auction, to me, sounds like N did not believe South knew it was spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S= 1n?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I suppose Susan was afraid that if she bid 3@C she might push them into a makeable game|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl by S clearly penalty|pg||
nt|psridhar: but can be beaten yes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ssbux: dangerous with 1NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: I agree with south's pass over 1C, but may overcall 1H with the N hand.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: south is bit weak   to vercall 1 Nt and has 2 cards in @h not enogh to double she estimated|pg||
nt|gracelin: not for lead directing, of course, but allows partner to join the party with suitable hands.|pg||
nt|twcho: if the @c7 is replaced by @c10, I guess many will overcall 1NT then|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: declarer herself may seek an entry in @d queen|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panosk: no |pg||
nt|panosk: with @D 2-2 and J10 @C dropping they can even make 3@C :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the uppercut works !|pg||
nt|sybarra: miight get a trump now |pg||
nt|rv: will anyone in panel open 2n?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sharkey: I think 3@C is better as N will know S also have defensive values. I wud bid 4@S without @CKJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes indeed, Tommy.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on board 3 NL pir reached 3Nt which should nod be a success|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kerasidis: in one of them doubled could gain some imps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulhac:  If Norths X showed spades I wonder why she did not then bid 2@H if she was prepared to stand the X|pg||

nt|panosk: yes gd defence got rewarded|pg||
nt|sharkey: it is NOT :(|pg||
nt|kerasidis: good question|pg||
nt|psridhar: Dhondy didnt have the benefit of seeing the cards as we all can , i thnk she fought till the end reasonably|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another 10-count for Senior.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: yes and @S would restrict S to +!.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not sure of their system but I think they play transfer responses to 1C|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet we see a "utililty" 1 @D here |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 10 well-deserved IMPs to ZhuJiang there for getting to and making the @H game.|pg||
nt|sybarra: all 3 level contracts in last hand -1 |pg||
nt|andyv:  part score battle|pg||
nt|sharkey: cant be if S bids 4@S directly|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  1 nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NT range possibly 14-16, but we have no evidence other than bidding and the fat they play Precision :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's fine otherwise. I have a @D suit that is well worth mentioning (playing in, leading) and I don't expect the counterpart to bid 2NT, so I would open 1@D.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but most like a push board even after opening 2NT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@s  two suiter|pg||
nt|gracelin: West cannot afford to see which minor partner has.|pg||
nt|psyck:  5@s, 4+minor, 8-10hcp usually|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: west shoud pass   with obvious misfit|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sybarra: 3 @S's as well |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: appears we have now lost score comparisons which makes life harder|pg||
nt|kerasidis: correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  majors|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes, with Hx support|pg||
nt|twcho: any CC downloadable for this tournament?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Probably 14-16|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: *fact|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: I doubt it tommy|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes looks like it |pg||
mb|d!|nt|rv: 2@d by East could show no preference to majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d here...pick your major|pg||
nt|twcho: we have to guess the meaning of the bids then. :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: at last a swing on 3 NS pushed to 5 level by W's 5@D bid then X'd|pg||
nt|panosk: had to cash A@S first to defeat 3@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D forcing Stayman?|pg||
nt|sharkey: gf|pg||
nt|kerasidis: can anyone inform us pls|pg||
nt|kerasidis: from the kibbs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bertheau may just leap to game in spades now|pg||
nt|psridhar: this shd be a flat 4@s making 11 tricks i expect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would|pg||
nt|jcwla: Dhondy might have trotted out 2@D over the X.|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Walddk2: Scientific bidding, splinter for spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: bit of daisy picking -slam chances are remote|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But are you slam-going opposite a passed hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and you are too strong to invite, so just bid 4@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agreed.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is just helping opps.|pg||
nt|psridhar: may be KQXXX,XX,XXX,QXX and opener gets to ruff 2 diamonds..|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry even one ruff wd do there|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: This is an invitational event, 8 sponsors with their teams|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: for the French pair  i have  an idea :)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|panosk: for me 4@S can be 6small spades and some single, but is a matter of approach |pg||
nt|rv: 2@d shows equal length (2-2 or 3-3) in majors usually|pg||
nt|psridhar: THIS hand -if W is allowed 2 ruffs...slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: I was kind enough not to say anything about hte 1NT last hand, but the words are just bubbling on my tongue|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is just cruising for a bruising here.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H=4 card support good hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  no battle at all as S decided to open a light NT|pg||
nt|loe48: true|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume 1 NT =13-15 or 12-14|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a nice advantage of a system that leaves that step in between.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is exactly why you need 2@C for the majors, and not 2@D or 2@H as in Capp and DONT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: standard lead onthis bidding should be trump with strong opposition in minors|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: now he has to make 6 |pg||
nt|ianmcc: could be up for another -100|pg||
nt|loe48: 13-15|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner must be able to ask for the longer with 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when she has equal length|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jcwla: Has anyone heard from Basia lately?  We need her.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Germ|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi|pg||
nt|panosk: has to guess which finess|pg||
nt|loe48: prolly prec|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I was sent a story yestaerday on Barry cranes rules for finding the missing Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: with nothing to go on |pg||
nt|sharkey: West made slam try in @D but E turned it down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: do tell Gary |pg||
nt|rv: low @h best now|pg||
nt|rv: still likely to be trick short|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 6@D not unreasonable with decent trump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see declarer coming to 8 tricks with proper defense.  With club forcing fummy to ruff, defense will be ahead.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: sure Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: either club or trump return will be fine.|pg||
nt|twcho: and good shift to @d by north|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, thougful defense before declarer's diamond losers pitched on the good H.|pg||
nt|gracelin: thoughtful|pg||
nt|psridhar: @d lead and contn =slam rt?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulhac:  Looks a fairly dull hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: but she is getting a @h|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kemperg: same in CR|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: 2@s, 2@h and 1 trick in each minor for defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: daisy-picking was a term used by Hugh Kelsey in one of his books. Don't mess around when you know what the contract should be is what he meant|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: You expect to be getting a @H lead and you have a very unappetizing holding.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: in a Major it is always over the Jack he claimed|pg||
nt|sybarra: its something about if they dont cover they dont have it?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and it worked here|pg||
nt|panosk: ah yes and only played with people who aplied his rule too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: apparently his partners were forced to follow his rule|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: he certainly played enough hands to verify a theory |pg||
nt|rv: pitch a @c now and another on @HK, can he make it now?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gracelin: a trump return now will also see declarer one trick short|pg||
nt|gracelin: or CA, of course.|pg||
nt|sybarra: how many bds in match?   I forgot to look |pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: South ruffing with natural tricks|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h9|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|sharkey: NS will do some bidding here I think|pg||
nt|rv: England open their IMP account|pg||
nt|rv: well played by Sally Brock to capitalize on misdefense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the chance of a 4333 all round?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10.9 per KR on the S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer asking if there is time limit for bid and play. The Conditions of Contest say 2H 15 min is allotted for the whole match.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they are also fairly strict to that,  but Tommy or Paul could tell us|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes time penalties are enforced normally|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If South overcalls 1NT what should West bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik:  slam time.|pg||

nt|sharkey: 2@D transfer ..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have any mathematicians in the audience?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  With a doubleton heart x did not look like an option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S constructive, 8-11|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: the dreaded 2@cX|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will be happy to sit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: dbl on that:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont doubt it |pg||
nt|peachy: East will likely balance with a Dbl, at least he should or else neg dbl would be a worthless convention for them|pg||
nt|peachy: West at the crossroads, what to do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, in an ugly spot|pg||
nt|peachy: he cant leave it in|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S the least of evils|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which pill would you swallow, pass or 2@S?|pg||
nt|peachy: bitter pill, but 2S for me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: me too|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i can not imagine 2 pairs playing same contract here...so a swing will come|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can win the battle by playing 2NT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Probably the vulnerability put West off bidding as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S super accept and max?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@H down on @S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: now we have traded 30 imps in 5 boards|pg||

nt|sybarra: a transfer interference? |pg||
nt|andyv:  this could easly go down 800|pg||
nt|ianmcc: It isn't obvious but that suit not good enough|pg||
nt|panosk: why S passed ?|pg||

pc|cA|nt|kemperg: suppose so|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no, operator will fix|pg||
nt|rv: max of 6 tricks for E-W if they cash out|pg||
nt|twcho: difficult to find the 2N bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Statistician - real mathematicians can't count, I am told :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: with the Major suits lying as they are this contract needs some double dummy play |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kerasidis: no will he try to secrifise or can see defensive vallues ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: expected to beat 4@S I assume|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: ok but 4@C doesnt preclude 4@S :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree.  though they might also make 3H with D 3-3.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes because the second @s stop is almost invisible|pg||
nt|twcho: NS have won the battle with the master suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Precious practice for all the top teams ahead of the Venice Cup next month in the Netherlands|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|rv: this deal would be more interesting in MPs or BAM than at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: this one may not be a success |pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: they almost avoided the failing game|pg||
nt|twcho: there is a promotion chance with 4th @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 4th round D may put declarer into guessing the trump position to make 2S.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sharkey: I was surprised he passed 4@S...|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D made in closed|pg||
nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
nt|panosk: yes took some effort to make |pg||
nt|loe48: 2 inputs|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like this off 2 so shud be a good score for NS|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|cK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: should be 4 * (13 choose 3) * (13 choose 3) * (13 choose 3) * (13 choose 4) divided by (52 choose 13)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Now you know!|pg||
nt|gracelin: West is thinking whether she should return a H after the first D, if declarer has a singleton HK.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ianmcc: defence's start promising|pg||
nt|twcho: not easy for west to find the @d continuation|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: N achieved the desired result with that x. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W is flat and minumum so should decline the invite|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: in that case she needs to take their HA before the 4th D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, Tommy, unless East has a way to deny the holding of HA in her discard.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be west shoul have switched to @h at trick 2  keeping options|pg||
nt|twcho: unless east find the K discard|pg||
nt|twcho: @hK|pg||
nt|gracelin: East should know west has two Hearts by passing 2H, so maybe he could pitch HK to deny HA.  If West has it, West will cash it anyway.|pg||
nt|twcho: then it will be a masterpiece|pg||
nt|ssbux: difficult to discard HK, what if declarer hold AQ in heart and Ax in C|pg||
nt|twcho: and one of the best defended hand then|pg||
nt|gracelin: SS, then partner won't pass 2H with a singleton.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcwla: And even then I wouldn't jump out of bed at night to write home about it.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|lebridgeur: very   bright!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need @h ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  they'll get one simply by the fact they will run out of cashers|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West might|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: low@d now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: @c ace pitching @d, @c ruff, @d to king, @c ruff, cash 2 @d pitching @H from dummy and hope for an endplay in trumps on N was a possibility |pg||
pc|d5|nt|kemperg: but I prefer 4@C cue and max.|pg||
nt|rv: good switch|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|panosk: will try for K@D doubleton?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why bridge is so interesting - S never supports @C and N bids 5@C all by himself on the 5 card suit....|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: 5 was not flat as PS predicted. West underbid with 2@S over partner's double|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: sry - 6 card suit|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|rv: not rewarded enough at IMPs|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar: essentially she had to hope to limit her losses to 2@H and one trump|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 7 imps quite a cruel penalty really|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2@c bid was reasonable on previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thought it should be only -1|pg||
nt|blewah: i think that's the most likely scenario, Rashed|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play 2@c (fourth suit) as Inv+ and not unconditional GF here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 1NT best now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing is ideal|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasting into 3 nt  most likely |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: DF makes 7@D on this hand :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 2@c as Inv+ with opener to show 2 ranges (11-bad 14) and good 14-17|pg||
nt|gracelin: bue even West did find the 4th round D play, declarer may still guess it right since SA is sure with East after west has shown an AKQxx suit in D.  also a likely honor in H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some don't like to multi with a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have no strong feelings|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcwla: Not the most beautiful hand to lead from.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D can only be hearts if weak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H was forcing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: looks like a club system in action |pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe over 2NT an accepting 3@H and then back to 3NT.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: Surely N is minimum for the original X?  Oh well, S would have done anyway and maybe should have to begin with.|pg||
nt|sybarra: on this bd|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11+11 = game vul I think|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 1-2 down|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer just needs to guess whether East start with AJ of trumps or AJ10|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like Prec|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't understand these methods :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so bidding never got to the 4 level|pg||
nt|panosk: but +300 is much beter than -100|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/senior-dhondy.pdf|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: 4@D x was -3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A nice way to resolve the angst about the imperfect 1NT rebid.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kerasidis: would you open W hand?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think I wud|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The favourable heart lie can produce 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|panosk: depends on my mood, if serious no :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: makes even on the improbable @d lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see N leading a @D nor doest it really mater |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|twcho: without any significant spot cards, west wisely chose 4@s to be the final contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: best contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we warn them about 6 @D|pg||
nt|panosk: 6nt looks gd as cards lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 12 in NT again a friendly K@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D I'm told is GF stayman, why he'd do it with only one major I don't know|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT in W or 2@D?|pg||
nt|blewah: NS would go for more if they know they also have fit in @c |pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: @CQ likely here to try to create an entry.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: quanti raise |pg||
nt|panosk: the friendliest kind |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 5  6 @H a push |pg||
nt|henryb:  6N would look good wherever the @hK was: 2@s, 1@h, 5@c and 4@d tricks unless the clubs do not behave|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Henry :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  gm Shirley @h|pg||
nt|panosk: hi henry|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 0745 for us here, hence the gm |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or the @D do not behave H|pg||
nt|henryb:  you have 4@d tricks on any break: look at the spots|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm watching live cricket from England I bet Roalnd is too|pg||
nt|panosk: the real question here is shud he accept?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland it probably at the match  |pg||
nt|henryb:  England - India?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, and England again amassing a huge 1st innings score|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we in deep thought? or losing conex?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think thought |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D for me, welcome Rashed :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Playing 2/1, I think 2D is automatic|pg||
nt|rv: best lead, now if North can win and switch to @h, I suspect Smith will cash 3@hs and switch to @s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|peachy: We dont have access to the player's system details|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E must have a plan as he continues to force|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|blewah: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome also aria|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Gary and Raija.|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Gary|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nice play by N.|pg||
nt|rv: good play and defense|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: they'll live to regret the result anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: I am happy that we now have more commentators, I was hoping to leave soon. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the more the merrier it is for me, one is quite lonely|pg||
nt|andyv:  since EW can make game, was E's 3@h bid conservative?|pg||
nt|kemperg: doubt, but we would end in 2|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wouldt either|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: 4@H makes whereas @S does not.|pg||
nt|sybarra: scary shift for declarer maybe|pg||
nt|psridhar: one adv of Multi is the strong hand becomes declarer -if u bid game|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooer|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is the word oof|pg||
nt|panosk: that was a danger after 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N should possibly be converting|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see he should but at the table not sure you know to do that |pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect some to end in 2@H after an original P by S and an NT opening by N.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panosk: bad lead for decl cant see bare K@H |pg||
nt|peachy: I think four is the perfect number, three is great too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|blewah: W bids reds and NT, E blacks only|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely end up playing 6NT or @D, as per their system.|pg||
nt|blewah: sure they are on the same wave |pg||
nt|ssbux: famous dish in Beijing, the Peking duck|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: high quality bridge as mentioned by Roland right at the start of this broadcast|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: The least expected.:)|pg||
nt|blewah: i was wrong, ok.|pg||
nt|peachy: G'night all, enjoy the match!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesn't look like it thought E was heading for 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Bye Raija, nice sleep.|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW plays 2/1 I think - East showed limit raise with 3 trumps so they stopped in 3@S|pg||
nt|loe48: its not an opener 1,2 seat imo|pg||
nt|kerasidis: aceless with no alternative bid|pg||
nt|loe48: 3rd seat 1s okay|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he do 6 @d only loding 1 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be able to make it as E also has 4@C|pg||
nt|twcho: though even 3NT is cold with even break in minors|pg||
nt|twcho: but 4@s rates to be a superior contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer wisely won the first club trick, or a D shift might be damaging.|pg||
nt|gracelin: though with HA in south and, even an opening D lead will not hurt the contract.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ok 10 easy tricks  |pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks to the H10.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some player play a response of 3@D to show 4-4-1-4 or 4-3-1-5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kemperg: N has enough to try make life diff. for strong @C|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes agree|pg||
nt|rv: now another @c, if finessed by Smith, North can win and back a @h, still declarer can get home for 9 tricks with @s breaking|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to say I prefer even the @C5 to the 7 for the opening salvo.|pg||
nt|rv: yes I like second best leads from poor suit, many experts even prefer attitude leads against nt|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcwla: Here you can put on your best air of faux innocence but it's kind of a readout.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panosk: its not i agree , but im not always rational on table :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: dag i have seen you open weaker hands in 3 seat :)|pg||
nt|loe48: 7 hps :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think most players wud open - but Pass will get many votes too|pg||
nt|panosk: 3rd seat is quite different|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S 2@C gf or inv+ with 3@Ss, 2@D, less then 16 pts, 2@S inv with 3crd. end|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kemperg: no option for N i think|pg||
mc|10|nt|rv: against nt, many folks don't show count by leading 4th best or 3/5, leads are attitude showing interest (low card lead) or disinterest (high card lead) in continuing suit|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|kiwibridge: 2@D multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one can make 6 but hard to get to|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT a much better contract than 4@S here|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 2@s has to be the min of the range for raises|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I think they've found one they can't miss.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W hand not big enough for 4@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 6, 2@C x in CR.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: doing well for 450 odd|pg||
nt|blewah: as you predicted|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: I still think it's a bad 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should get them to 6|pg||
nt|blewah: another example that a singleton meets xxx can be very valuable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi=weak on one major|pg||
nt|ianmcc: who wants to be in 6?|pg||
nt|ssbux: Patrick, will you open W hand with precision 1NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not to stay out of slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: like a wk 2 bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree, no harm to pass 1@H and wait for P's response who is not a passed hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  still, need to guess @s Q and need K@d on side...so not a great slam|pg||
nt|rv: 2n seems to be jacoby showing 4+@s, 12+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: no no cant be S bidding 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: undo operator |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: 4@S is off from the top if they find the heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even now it has problems|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W is gonna leap to game on that hand then it is better to go via 1N on tht E hand even|pg||
nt|jcwla: EW eschewing any revealing bidding on a couple such auctions here, in both cases with the strong hand having a side 4-card @H suit that (besides 3NT) might also have been a ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: preferable alternative on other hands.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: E in good position to check on keycards |pg||
nt|rv: seems to be conventional (possibly home-grown) treatment subsequently|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed, 3NT .|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2N guarantees 4@s...many play garbage stayman and would have to bid 2@s with S hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|panosk: E doesnt know which major but he correctly thinks its spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are various methods, my multi 2@D = weak 2 either major OR 20-22 with a 5 card suit OR and 8+ playing tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a lot of folks include a strong bid in multi  |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not as a rule with most pard's I play with on bbo |pg||
nt|andyv:  but momentum may put them there|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 2 strong as in NZ version|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may try 5@d now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 @h should  show 5 5    usually|pg||
pc|sA|nt|twcho: without fit with partner, east stayed low by bidding 2N instead of 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|twcho: and with much better than minimum hand, west happily accepts the invitation|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: 2 finesses.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes maybe it was |pg||
pc|s5|nt|kemperg: no, with garbage you have both majors and pass 2@H|pg||
nt|panosk: yes there are various version , also 1 with strong 3 suiter|pg||
nt|ianmcc: and drop|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kemperg: next|pg||
nt|sybarra: in general,  multi is not/can not be played in usa|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|andyv:  W must have realized the 4@c bid was already an overbid and did well to stop in 4|pg||
nt|blewah: agree, 4@c was an upgrade|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: I see 11 tricks, 12 made in CR|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: funny USA, trying to protect the innocent, actually it's easy enough to defend|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: with  9 minors cards known in West hand , East judged that she does not care to propose her second major suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: next week in Tienjin China will see another Men's Elite team invitational with high cash prize.  USA, Italy/England, Netherland, Sweden, Norway , 2 teams from China and the Asia ...|pg||
nt|gracelin: Stars will compete in this event.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: we need help from operator or spectators to decipher subsequent auction post 2n|pg||
nt|twcho: a very sensible auction|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|sybarra: that was fairly fearless|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  right...if they had garbage hand...but since 2N over 2@h would deny a 4 card major, they would have to bid 2@s with the invite hand and 4 spades.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart pitch now will allow it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that did not happen|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzmc: 2NT show 4 support|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: agree Gary,  and many have heard me say I played in Neth.  and evey jr, youth and granny had a defense to multi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On the bidding CR had better chance of playing 6@D.|pg||
nt|rv: conventional (read traditional) response to jacoby 2n is 3 level bids show stiff, 3M denies stiff with extra length, 3n shows extras hcp possibly 15-17 (maybe 5422), 4 level bids ...|pg||
nt|rv: shows second 5 card suit, 4M shows sub-min/min opening with no redeeming feature|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to beg off here, thanks all, enjoy the rest.|pg||
nt|rv: there are plenty of variations to traditional jacoby and conventional jacoby is hardly played by most of the experts nowadays|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  Not true, Shirley. Multi can be used in any team game of 6+ boards where the players are "Flight A"|pg||
nt|panosk: yes if you dont know what to bid wait till they say their suit and then take action like double |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kiwibridge: our Juniors love to play and defend it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcwla: Relaxing to know off a keycard, don't have to think.  Can't complain about this pace - halfway through in 40 mins.|pg||
nt|twcho: what is the prize size? it is comparable to this tournament?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good defence by Heather Dhondy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: but it is limited Henry |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: thats a dangerous 5@D bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @C holding in N hand and @h holding in S hand will be hard to describe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least her majors are equally good|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: nice bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H now competitive or inviting?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Precision 2@C here, 6+ in the absence of a major, now 7+  NS will shortly be in game.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S is good raise of @D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since about 60% of our tables are now in team events, either 2-day KOs or Swiss, its not true that it is even close to barred|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: thats tempting :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i would|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or is it bad|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I don't like vul 2 level O/C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you take the money as South or just bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|rv: sitting here I will surely take money|pg||
nt|rv: at the table, I will contemplate a bit more and still take the money|pg||
nt|rv: on accurate defense it could go for 800?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price right for a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all Thx Roland|pg||
nt|rv: Hi P.Sridhar, gm|pg||
nt|ssbux: welcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  gm P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am in full agreement with RV there- odds do not favour that 2@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: GM Andy/RV :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: high level competitors have tools these days to reach their contracts even after 2@d/2@s, so some usefulness of intervention is already lost|pg||
nt|psridhar: and the risk of going for 500/800 exixts still|pg||
nt|psridhar: exists|pg||
nt|rv: 800 is not possible for N-S, on perfect defense declarer could still get out for -500, not very costly|pg||
nt|ssbux: Sorry, I mean veteran pair|pg||
nt|sybarra: could be either |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nevena Senior has been passing all set and lost patience. She loves to bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kemperg: dbl should be inviting for me|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Too good for 2@H?|pg||
nt|loe48: to strong for 2h non vul|pg||
nt|twcho: who will be your partner, Patrick?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Logically, it should be that for others, too|pg||
nt|loe48: if vul 2h okay|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, weak 2 is 4-8 with green against red|pg||
nt|rv: Brock must have heaved sigh of relief|pg||
nt|psridhar: meanwhile appreciate how much better the E hand is if one of those minor honors she has -is in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least this can't be misinterpreted as a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: pref both:)|pg||
nt|rv: yes I would O/C with KQJ9XX, AX, XXX, XX even at these colors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Marion may think that this is a slam invite since Dekkers did not bid 4@H the round before|pg||
nt|psridhar: and that hand also is 10 HCP :)|pg||
nt|rv: and still may not with just J or Q in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand her way of thinking|pg||
nt|rv: 5 level is safe, no harm even if Marion bids 4@s|pg||
nt|ssbux: Herstein?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: weak 2 is out of the question in any vul for me|pg||
nt|loe48: vul vs non vul i open 2h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: just a max in other circumstances for me|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers will sign-off in 5@h quickly|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brock's pass of X must show @d , 2@d X is possibly a good spot for EW ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not bid 4@H before? Double + 4@H slam invitational she must be thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: Herstein Liu, used to be my teammate but in this tournament I will partner with him.|pg||
nt|twcho: good luck Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: tks, ust try not to disgrace ourself.  |pg||
nt|jcwla: K&R 9.75 here, I tell you having all these 10's and 11's really can get to you.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Much easier to have 4 and 5's.|pg||
nt|psridhar: TWO aces the only feature of opener's hand |pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fairness, the 1NT rebid shows (11)12-14 according to their CC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 11 is legitimate|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kemperg: agree with you on the last hand, 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  W better lead a trump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can borrow one from E.:)|pg||
nt|panosk: if you need to open 1 is much beter |pg||
nt|gracelin: It's nice to see a natural 2D over the 1NT rebid.  Many play this as a GF check-back.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  anyone like N's 4@s bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still time for brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps S should keycard and then sign off in 5@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: Roland's point is very valid -but before that we should know whats X of 2@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding 5@h directly might give N some encouragement to bid on|pg||
nt|rv: Marion Michielsen has an excellent hand opposite unilateral jump to 4@h, a) no wastage in @h, b)4 trumps and c) all those controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double of 2@D would usually be "I want to double at least one major"|pg||
nt|psridhar: if it was a value showing X , N is justified in slam try; if it was a take out X, i think she has less cause|pg||
nt|psridhar: oh penalty X ?|pg||
nt|rv: I would treat North's hand as super-max for the auction so far|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: N agrees|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would not be my choice with 4-card @H's but they're obv on the same wavelength.|pg||
nt|peachy: North is delighted to go, five good trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the match is very tight   now 2 imps difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even @DA and a low heart through will not be enough|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and what % are Flight A ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he can't have liked his 2@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 2 aces S must bid 5NT. GS.|pg||
nt|gracelin: then they also use 2C to force a 2D rebid to stop in 2D.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when spades arefavourable|pg||
nt|psridhar: some times defense has to be content with declarer making the contract :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: What will come back a @H or a @C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't take bets :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: I suspect that not many in North America and Europe have heard about the city Shenzhen in the Guangdong province, the venue for this tournament. Shenzhen has more than 10 million ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: inhabitants!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: French pair Ns  uses only 2 @c as a check back stayman|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: @C lead would be interesting.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if K@c is lead, E needs to rise with A and return @d|pg||
nt|psridhar: N has a difficult task -if she is required to guess that her partner made a "penalty oreineted X" and changed her mind later|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, no worries for 5@d:)|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure if N-S playing any last train cue bids, if they play Dekkers could have bid 5@d with any sort of interest and her 5@h would state I have no interest|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h = long @H, with that suit, she couldnt possibly have expected to defend 2@H X|pg||
nt|psridhar: good, thoughtful lead -will set 5N here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like your question, Jordan|pg||
nt|psridhar: @d back is another format for submitting your resignation|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one probably won't make the textbooks|pg||
nt|blewah: and 5 card support|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what a horror double|pg||
nt|blewah: E "knew" S has his own suit|pg||
nt|twcho: a very comfortable contract for NS|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rnmalik: why x in S where opps are being vul are in a losing contract.|pg||
nt|twcho: CR NS bid to 3NT and make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is  Star-studded international field. Click on  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||

pc|d3|nt|sybarra: I am told the E player is young Aussie player,   Her mother Janet Brown is a well known player from the eastern coast of NSW (she plays in a seaside town called Ballina).|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True she nows lives in harrogate England and is the partner of the Irish international Hugh McGann|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you Roland, your suspicion is spot on, I'm sure|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, he can afford to misguess everything.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|kerasidis: this b would be very interesting in pair contest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well played|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ssbux: ok, which room, Open?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West suprisingly did not continue @h losing a trick|pg||
nt|twcho: Even 4@h is not without chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe she feared partner would be ruffing with Qxx or A10x for a natural trump trick.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|rv: North should duck this to restrict damage|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  down 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may have been a battle between 500 and 550|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6N was indeed found CR for another 2 imps|pg||
pc|cT|nt|henryb:  In Swiss, about a third; in KOs about a quarter; but anyone is allowed to play Flight A in a Swiss|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: Bill tells me CR in 6@C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: vul against non -vul.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so EW probably saved a couple of imps by pulling 5@dx|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lebridgeur: 4 @h   is very optimistc contract !|pg||
pc|h6|nt|twcho: certainly. :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  E/W are a young pair (both under 30) who have established themselves in the England team|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: you see luck has already evened out, E-W bid a good slam on deal 3 which went down, here 2@d O/C has caused problem to opps who have overreached|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|blewah: from +400 to -130|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|jcwla: Presumably E thought maybe just maybe this 4@S was on dist'n |pg||

nt|ianmcc: N/S probably unhappy but N/S closed not laughing either|pg||
nt|panosk: -1 shud be gd result for NS|pg||
nt|loe48: yes -1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|panosk: EW can make 4@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: The opening hands on Bd 9 and Bd 7 are rated equal according hand evaluator - 11 HCP http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQx+AKJx+AK98+Kx|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS likely to get to 3 NT here|pg||
nt|ssbux: as stated previous by Roland, the English pair is not affected the unlucky bd 2 and 3.  They are now coming back|pg||
nt|psridhar: slam on then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All the top teams next month in the Venice Cup in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand should be fun |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sybarra: 15 opposite 9 |pg||
nt|kerasidis: 1nt open by W here?|pg||
nt|rv: with that hand with South, even GS on rite?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 10 with W having all the rest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  2+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|panosk: 10 actually and yes why didnt he tried at least ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 10, with all suits behaving nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: right 10 |pg||
nt|psridhar: yes-so slam on with less one card less|pg||
nt|rv: even if South had one of the minor honor cards missing in PS's example hand, LS would be cold|pg||
nt|gracelin: Now a not so routine 3NT for NS.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|twcho: and 4@h will go down if defense find the @d switch in time|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 @h by North|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: showing good @d   and propose for NT contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: more Precise here|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|sharkey: or EW may be in trouble...|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess it's a fit showing jump showing invitation strength.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  usually done with 5 card @c though|pg||
nt|paulhac:  So with board 3 to score England take the lead for the first time|pg||
nt|psridhar: the @C suit is fast becoming a mere stepping sttone in all auctions|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panosk: its not just the actual pts count he also had gd spots|pg||
nt|henryb:  Slam on a hook that loses|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@H down on the losing finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: What's good for the goose is good for the gander here with the ace underleads to NT dummy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S doesnt know N has values - unless he x|pg||
nt|panosk: he will soon :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  but this hand seems to be a good time to uise it with 4 esp woth those @d's|pg||
nt|twcho: with all those spot cards, 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3@c  shows @d and @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: even those who bid it naturally do it on 2 cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: is 1@c forcing Roland? i thk not -Bd 1 we saw 1@c all pass by W|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: 6@C was -3 to make the carnage worth 15|pg||
nt|blewah: did it really make?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange and defence to other contracts after preempt by P.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure Jean-Paul is right.  3C showed a 3NT invitational hand with D fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer might return a H after winning HK.|pg||
mb|r|nt|kiwibridge: W keeps them out by bidding probably|pg||
nt|psridhar: but NS need to sort out if Dekkers wd bid that way holding such pattrens|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S is normally a weak NT, but the question is if you should still invite with 2NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: only point for consideration, would South have bid 5@d as last train cue bid with such hands?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: weird in my opinion....N doesnt know south's 18 points hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Score another one for weak NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: to make sure she establish a 2nd H trick.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: no  3@c   shows limit fit in @d  with @c suit usually 5 4 the other way|pg||
nt|twcho: so another sensible auction leading to a cold contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: OK, Jeam-Paul must be right about the French girls bidding :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, 1@C is NF|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: south shall x again|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats a shrewd 2@c escape attempt|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: Bertheau played 1C on board 2|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: could be 300|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 was not that difficult to bid on last hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats another crucial point rv|pg||
nt|peachy: Board 3 is already included in the 21 England has, it was a 1IMP for making 7, French pair made 6 |pg||
nt|sybarra: did E have a better play,  like J of hts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does she get the @D switch?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  benedct Cronier passed the hand Fiona Brown opened 1@H|pg||
nt|peachy: or is it?.  The website running score shows 16-20|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does she need the @D ruff?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: i'm a huge meckwell proponent as far as slam bidding is concerned need more than 50% chance to bid it |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: and - If N and W hands are reversed....|pg||
nt|loe48: if north bid 2h then bid 2s|pg||
nt|panosk: he wudnt run W|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: thanks Patrick :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Heart return is a sure play while to establish a club trick is not.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What would you do now, double or 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like double|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  but they needed to have the right asking bids|pg||
nt|psridhar: can she escape for d1?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice defense|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he could claim only if he knew that there was an auto black squeeze on S @SK @CJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble for the Swedes is that 3NT might make|pg||
nt|psridhar: losing just 2 trumps, 2 aces and 2 @s ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and this will likely only go 1 down|pg||
nt|jcwla: They were about to play 1NT, wtp|pg||
nt|psridhar: the @h 10 is coming down, so they better set up and cash their @s in time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like this auction by Dhondy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Questionable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a diplomat in my spare time|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3 rounds of trumps wont do i think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianmcc: that's what S said to N|pg||
nt|sharkey: What was 2@D?|pg||
nt|gracelin: not like in Yeh's Cup the winner almost takes all the prize home.  Here the prize money is much more evenly distributed from $30,000 to 25,000, to 20,000 and up to $12,000 for the ...|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I've watched a lot of Meckwell and their slam bidding is quite weak, they do make up for it in other ways for sure|pg||
nt|blewah: so he was sure @sK would be left bare by S?|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@h probably asked for 3rd round control |pg||
nt|psridhar: she has escaped d1 on misdef , but if defense had shifted to @s , it was -500|pg||
nt|psridhar: after that disastrous @H hook i mean|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: and 5@S showed yes.|pg||
nt|blewah: they must have played together before|pg||
nt|kerasidis: West thinks now.. ouffff what a releif :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: The 2 Chinese ladies team met in the 1st match and saw a low scoring 16:14 VP split.  All other 3 matches were one-sided.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: As the linesmen used to say when we came on court at 6-5 in the third set, "We only come in to close."|pg||
nt|blewah: anyway, slam now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lebridgeur: an  easy 4 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: you are right 2 cards of @H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: But there S did bid 3NT over 2@H.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ending trick 11 W @SAX @CJ and E last trump and @SQx so south 100% squeezed|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: to me this is the worst auction so far|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no multi S will he bid 4 now, yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: seems light for 2N|pg||
nt|rv: what is Brock's 2n here?, I would have passed and not even venture 3@d|pg||
nt|peachy: At first glance, I thought S had about 8 points, but it is 12...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can be 5 cards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  2@d, one or both majors?|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone texas the hand?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think they dont like slams as much as they do games hence they become more conservative not that they cant |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourIndex.aspx?tourid=1174  for the tournament website in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer must lose a 2nd club trick so in fact will need HA to be on side, or a good guess if North leads one at some stage.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kemperg: seems 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One, the Multi defense|pg||
nt|twcho: Patrick, you have a tight schedule. Playing in Beijing from Wednesday and then go to Tianjin next week|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, just anoter bridge week.|pg||
nt|sybarra: just a "first one" to 1 nt hand |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kemperg: not me|pg||
nt|panosk: bid them correctly that is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Martin|pg||
nt|sybarra: made a lot in the other room |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Martin welcome |pg||
nt|psridhar: whatever the merit of this system is , they have sacrificed Vs their 3@s here-as cards are|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: too weak.|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes on a @h lead|pg||
nt|rv: they will get to another slam here after this start to auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: E wont give up|pg||
nt|psridhar: i suspect this is going all the wway to slam|pg||
nt|rv: in my view, I will pass 2@s with West hand, will panel O/C 3@D, I presume not many will consider 2n|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Apologies for mentioning Germany before. They are not taking part, Canada is|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  I'd bid it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had a leap to 2 nt over a minor,  never sure waht it means |pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think 6@h is too hard|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I abhor that fatuous 2NT resposne to the nebulous 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: i "hate" is what is should say |pg||
nt|panosk: more or less same as what 1nt does :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: abhor = fancy word for hate :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: true but should not be bid.|pg||
nt|blewah: Precision EW|pg||
nt|rv: Nicola Smith has taken Sally Brock's 2n very seriously|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: there was no clue for her to not take it seriously :)|pg||
nt|rv: yes:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  N can force an entry to get this down 1|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  not now|pg||
nt|andyv:  in mp I agree....not sure in imps |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/LandyMulti.html|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as the Woolsey defense when it backfires, says Steve Robinson|pg||
nt|pfbr: morning Roland@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GM dear A @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  S would need to be clairvoyant and not lead a @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: knowing pard will open any pathetic 11 count should be good reason for not lurching to 2NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: tie for club nw|pg||
nt|gracelin: now|pg||
nt|gracelin: time|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: forgive my absence as I am cooking in order to be around for the last set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H/@S on @S finesse.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blewah: "i claim, S will have to have @sK and @cJ  when I play the 11th trick"|pg||
nt|blewah: @cQ. sry|pg||
nt|psridhar: can EW make 4@H? |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has 3 losers but 4@S had 4 tough hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S by Senior a two-way shut. Either it makes, or if it doesn't, maybe the opponents can make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *shot|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  5@h asks for quality of @h suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kerasidis: about the previous....does north know that his partner has 18 points?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: North has to lead Black?|pg||
nt|blewah: can make with the trump lay out|pg||
nt|andyv:  are there enough tricks on @h lead?|pg||
nt|blewah: needs to run @h from dummy twice|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may have draw too many trumps and doesn't have enough entry fr both setting up club and lead toward dummy's HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but south helped her for the H issue.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: but south hs done part of the job|pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer is home|pg||
nt|ssbux: sorry, have to go,emergency call from boss. bye|pg||
nt|gracelin: bye SS|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|blewah: need to ruf 1 @d only i think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to play.|pg||
nt|andyv:  harder than it looks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W tries to pitch on K@c, the contract should fail|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  nice play by N|pg||
nt|gracelin: south is trying to reach north for a club ruff, but that will be only defender's 3rd trick, andlast.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: testing, anyway|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|kemperg: perfect|pg||
nt|jcwla: E needed to take out the scissors.|pg||
nt|andyv:  very true|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to see the danger but probably a no cost play to lead a @s on trick 2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Play a @S right back before the @D ruffing pos'n established - |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the multi in CR bought 2NT which was -3|pg||
nt|blewah: ruff @d now and play another @h|pg||
nt|kerasidis: and if he does why not bidding 2 nt over 2spades?|pg||
nt|loe48: no|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rv: no entry to dummy, otherwise double finesse in @hs and hoping for 3-2 break was best chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shut was better than the word I wrote first |pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: I managed to edit, fortunately|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 4@H can make -another matter if EW wd reach it on their own steam|pg||
mc|9|nt|rnmalik: good play.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: justice here|pg||
nt|panosk: yes that was a lucky break|pg||
nt|andyv:  a @s lead would have tested W as both of his entries to dummy can be knocked out quickly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is very inconsiderate to have  u  and  i   next to each other on keyboards|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: thats why i mean he need to x again, to show big opener|pg||
nt|rv: in my view, E-W are over aggressive in their bidding based on deals in this session|pg||

nt|psridhar: i am ready to take the blame:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: sry, private|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 9 where we made 3nt (in1)  they were in 3 at the other table going down |pg||
nt|blewah: S stopped in 5 after finding out he missed 1 kc and Q trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a bit more agressive in this room |pg||
nt|sybarra: E didnt interfere in the CR |pg||
nt|twcho: will you overcall with east hand?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|andyv:  but impressive:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if 3N shows longer @cs|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl and then??|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 9, 5@D x -1 in CR.|pg||
nt|andyv:  best for N to pass|pg||
nt|panosk: i quite like 1nt here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: t|pg||
nt|loe48: 13-15. and x on same values..|pg||
nt|kerasidis: so would you stay in nt doubled with 6 points?|pg||
nt|loe48: so 15+|pg||
nt|panosk: for sure|pg||
mb|3C|nt|panosk: more informative than mere 2@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: splinter raise perfect for N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Gary and everyone.|pg||
nt|panosk: we have the lead too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be N shud bid 2 NT over 2@s?|pg||
nt|loe48: i sit on nt x with 6 100 of 100 times|pg||
nt|gracelin: and not as much :(|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other room the opening was 1C, E was rendered mute|pg||
nt|sybarra: that made a difference maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: he knows the Shenzen tong|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not totally without risk?  Or did the XX promise a 3-bagger?|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever it shows, E can't sit for it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the typo, should have been  ½   about mid way through the sentence|pg||
nt|peachy: Nice pull, as it turns out|pg||
nt|kemperg: N will, but E|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes you get to play it here |pg||
nt|gracelin: the bottom team will only get US$2,000 instead of US$12,000 here.|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, thanks Patrick, voice commentators were discussing it & i was replying to to them based on what you said|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if artificial maybe you should come in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @C was probably "could be 2"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cant be all bad|pg||
nt|rv: East's hand just about minimum for t/o with this shape (4333) or would panel require a bit more?|pg||
nt|gracelin: not sure what the double means exactly.  Maybe just sort of bid something double.|pg||
nt|sybarra: instead of better minor |pg||
nt|psridhar: Bd 10 3nt came home so another gain for Eng|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wow, 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@h is truly a dreamer's bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Rashed good to have your company @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: u said she likes to bid -that @C suit is provoking alright|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  you dream that S will have the right dummy for you|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could have perhaps balanced with 3c at the end |pg||
nt|peachy: The bidding diagram shows no alert, that does not mean a whole lot, unless they play 5542|pg||
nt|twcho: I will overcall 2@c and never consider 3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panosk: and if pard stronger i dont mind playing higher than 1|pg||
nt|blewah: and he proved he was right by misguessing the Q trump :)|pg||
nt|rv: no @c wastage and approx 14 hcp is my requirement with 4M333 shape for t/o double of minor opening|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you tommy |pg||
nt|sybarra: but maybe 2 @C meant something different |pg||
nt|sybarra: like michaels|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would probably balance|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are white!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C is fine by me, little danger of missing game opposite passed hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: I'm not privvy to their agreements nor that steady on Precision, what might 4NT mean I wonder|pg||
nt|sybarra: that puts it to declarer |pg||
nt|panosk: yes shud be torchoured a bit for his bid :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: how ever you spell tortured,  that is being done|pg||
nt|panosk: i meant tortured of course|pg||
nt|panosk: E carefully took with A@H so no clues|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N of course should pull to 2@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think with so many english words it is difficult for europeans |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CR in 5@S X I'm told so another swing coming|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid but makes 6@H as the cards are placed.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: we have words that sound the same and spelled differently |pg||
nt|gracelin: East was hoping West can bid NT with Kx of spade, but she dorgot partner doesn't has any H stopper to bid NT.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psridhar: factor the passed hand pd in rv :)|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D is GF checkback, 2@s showed 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers can play this deal easily, she knows location of all honor cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer needs to play @s twice and @h once - 3 entries to dummy needs and she has 3 alright|pg||
nt|rv: she is thinking of catering to 4-1 @s break with @SAQ8X with East|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kemperg: E did not go for the possible penalty pass in W, |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not a peep from EW to worry them either|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c forced 2@d I think|pg||
nt|blewah: XYZ convention or some sort|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree with 2nd double from South then N shud act|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud have ducked @D lead|pg||
nt|loe48: i mean, how much do they need to sit on it..not much hps left out now besides what he had|pg||
nt|gracelin: so eventually she bid NT herself and was raised to game.|pg||
nt|psyck:  should W have tried 3@s on 1@s then?|pg||
nt|psyck:  E|pg||
nt|twcho: with most favorable lie of @d, 3NT will roll in|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|andyv:  this should go down 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  float the 10|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kemperg: No opening in W so perhaps good decision|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of bidding being done |pg||
nt|andyv:  looking at all 4 hands, EW are hard pressed to bid and make anything|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Have to go thanks all Patrick Tommy Krishna and specs|pg||
nt|twcho: bye Jean-Paul|pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks Jean-Paul, you are most helpfl|pg||
nt|psyck:  thx Jean-Paul|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Martin  another good reason|pg||
nt|psridhar: can beat with trump switch,  perhaps Decl can find the @s end play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: now EW make 2NT on defence|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: only 10 tricks because of @c blockage?|pg||
nt|rv: East win second @s and play back second @d|pg||
nt|psridhar: rt|pg||
nt|psridhar: East shd hv won the first @s itself|pg||
nt|psridhar: but 4@S will make always|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  no useful pitch coming on J@c|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kerasidis: opps play weak nt so double can be weaker...that was my point|pg||
nt|loe48: 15+|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  somewhere the wheels came off or maybe W just decided to chance it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: Cannot blame E for this one I wouldn't think.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: almost|pg||
nt|panosk: or i shud have studied harder when my parents paid for my english classes :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: NAH,  you had a good time!|pg||
nt|panosk: long way from it yes :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|loe48: so u sit on 21+|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|rv: is this risky line if @cs are 5-2?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: the defence slip from grace|pg||
nt|panosk: as a fellow viewer pointed out E cant have all high cards in clubs since he didnt played it, so must have AK@H that was a clue|pg||
nt|panosk: gd point|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|loe48: and strong hand behind opener|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|h5|nt|gracelin: don't see the hurry to take DA by north, her only entry for the spade.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :) ok lets leave that i am sure that we could speak till tomorrow for that....more or less it was good for alayzing|pg||
nt|rv: I much prefer second @s by declarer|pg||
nt|twcho: so again east find the not so promising @s switch and let the contract make|pg||
mc|9|nt|psridhar: if E had switched to trump , W wd hv had to give her pd a @s relief for a 2nd trump -tough def|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 2s is so automatic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact i would hope to be studying dummy about now|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you consider a dble of 2 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what that would mean|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes with north hand to confirm real suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: and hope pard doesnt leap off the deep end in @D's|pg||
nt|peachy: Playing "could be 2" club, it could even mean "got them".  Other meanings also possible, like extra values or hearts and extra values|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is brown in browning motion|pg||
nt|peachy: we've had technical difficulties, lets hope this is not prelude to a crash|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen this slow bidding before here|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@c probably promise 3+ as noted with previous board|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe lots of questions and writing?|pg||
nt|peachy: N opened 1C with AKx diam and xx clubs earlier|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont care if 1c promises 0, 2c is by default a cue bid|pg||
nt|twcho: she opened 1@d with that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C has to be a spade raise |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think |pg||
nt|twcho: only the CR North opened 1@c|pg||
nt|psridhar: 14 Roland... Sweden will approve that 1N :)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: The case of the missing initial pass.|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad, 1@h by S would have been more fun|pg||
nt|andyv:  awkward dbl by W unless it shows a Major and Minor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that one will be hard to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S should be happy to sit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: me too Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: dangerous for us to play maybe Gary?|pg||
nt|twcho: what is 3@c?|pg||
nt|twcho: seems 3@d a better description for her hand|pg||
nt|psyck:  looking for a @c stop from pd for 3n i guess intending to go to 5@d else|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  ah, it is just that|pg||
nt|kemperg: good in honneurs, but shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  no a matter of overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: the critical point was W not to get trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 5@SX was 500 a 5 imps to jiegao|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree but timid pass by E of NT.:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed it was|pg||
nt|blewah: i don't see very often now, with 12 count|pg||
nt|rv: this shows 11-14, it could even go upto 15 hcp in some partnerships because of 1@s is inconvinient |pg||
nt|psyck:  5@d best here with 4@s in trouble|pg||
nt|twcho: and 3N hopeless|pg||
nt|gracelin: and 3NT in deeper trouble.|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@d should be a much better bid than 3@c imo|pg||
nt|psyck:  E intends this seq to show dobts about 3N|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, I agree with Tommy, East has better bid 3D instead of 3C last round.|pg||
nt|psyck:  i do agree that 3@d would have been preferable to 3@c|pg||
nt|twcho: with east overcalling, EW bid to the unbeatable 4@s contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh dear me |pg||
nt|panosk: wud have like 4 small spades vul |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H not best |pg||
nt|ssbux: can they stop in 3H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W does like her hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT will also be opened in the other room, but that will be 12-14 for EW there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and then West will not bid game|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: one day hopefully, we will put that to the test|pg||
nt|gracelin: Dekkers gets the message about doubt of 3NT.|pg||
nt|psyck:  W takes out 3N with no @c stop|pg||
nt|twcho: although 5@d needs careful handling to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Much depends on NT range|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and it is 14-16 for the Swedes|pg||
nt|psridhar: where is the making game ? 3N will go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did I say it will make?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: I only bid..look at the distribution....let pard know I have 3 @S  |pg||
nt|panosk: W cant acrually go higher, E might have KQ in @S|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h is a fair game-unlucky @c break beats it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Thereis no point in playing negative doubles if East passes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if EW forgot what they were playing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|kemperg: no system against 1NT:(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@C by E and 2@D by W. |pg||
nt|andyv:  with 8 tricks off the top, this should be a nice pick up for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  W dbl, unless conventional, was ill advised.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a big Pass from East|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could be expensive since EW don't have a game|pg||
nt|panosk: *actually|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have other forcing bids,  dbls etc |pg||
nt|twcho: ok, delayed @d|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|gracelin: yes, need almost double dummy to make.  Instead of ruffing 3rd round H, declarer need to ruff out SQ before playing K, and Q of trumps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: But as other room was -2 at 3NT, EW will not lose the board here, whatever the game they choose.|pg||
nt|twcho: but at least this line isn't impossible|pg||
nt|twcho: probably one round of trump first|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E was too strong for 1NT anyway|pg||
nt|panosk: which wud be a waste|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s is doomed|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: you are risking Spade 5-1 to protect H 7-1.  No declarer will find that double dummy play.|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer has a dilemma without solution|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: 3 losers and home.|pg||
nt|rv: yes in practise most partnerships will get to 4@h|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcwla: Many IMPs are lost by those who "compensate" for their underweight earlier actions by making non-systemic auction-ending passes later.|pg||
nt|andyv:  with dbl and michaels available, I wonder why S chose to bid such a raggedy suit|pg||
nt|peachy: you are all right, it was Closed rm N who did it. Sorry to talk nonsense, but sometimes nonsense happens!|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|twcho: probably going for a finesse in trump now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|panosk: true|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: declarer is hopping north to have some 3-3-2-5 hands.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcwla: Especially when accompanied by those appealing black suits, the @H's look more like 4 than like a primary one-suiter.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c7|nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|gracelin: so that she may lose only 1 trick each in S, D, and C.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: after this defense it is the 6-2 @s break in addn that defeats|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|gracelin: now ruff a club and D|pg||
nt|twcho: but no entry to hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
mc|8|nt|rnmalik: why not small @C and duck by N.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England had great results on 10 and 11 in the other room|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: S didn't open on 11 eventually gained 2 imps for his side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: USA has two teams|pg||
nt|psridhar: nice try by Smith -played for J10X in @h with N|pg||
nt|twcho: they has scored the game bonus despite in an inferior contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They made 3NT and 4@H respectively|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|jcwla: Well it is not like there are not potential losses from failing to identify a 5-bagger major.|pg||
nt|andyv:  HongMian on roll having scored the last 24 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: routine 3NT|pg||
nt|babs59: board 11 had a weird sort of symmetry Roland...|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|andyv:  there must by some system glich for W not to be able to show a weak hand with the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|andyv:  S will run to 3@c...then the fun should begin|pg||
nt|jcwla: And end - with 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: doesnt N have a michaels bid or something?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E better that a 2@S raise 3 for me|pg||
nt|babs59: Open Room NS bid 2S 4S,  Closed Room EW bid 2H 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Go on|pg||
nt|babs59: so the Swedes never took a bid in either room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  nope, both of us are wrong|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, my prediction was conditional upon yours.|pg||
nt|gracelin: will West choose to play the 5-3 or 6-2 major suit game after East showed her 5-6 distribution ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Swedes are very modest|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: EW only reached 3@S so just 1 imp|pg||
nt|blewah: NS play prec|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know because I am ½ Swedish|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 4@h seems safer which can stand the punching game by defenders|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm recalling North's (Rimstedt) 1NT opening on board 1 :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  ok, so the run was to 4@c...I was just premature|pg||
nt|kemperg: no transfers on weak 1NT and no Stayman relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play constructive raises  but also some form of bergen |pg||
nt|panosk: N has a 2@H bid i think|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd prefer a 1@d opg 3rd seat here|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like a Gazzilli action.  2C either natural or 17+, 2D showed 8+ and GF Vs the strong hand.|pg||
nt|psyck:  E chooses not to show the @s's|pg||
nt|twcho: another handsome pickup by England|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Systemic|pg||
nt|babs59: true - but hardly appealing even if 9-11|pg||
nt|psridhar: After this lead the @c suit is frozen for defense ( cant play it again profitably)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: bidding weak suits in weak hands -3rd seat - not a gr8 idea|pg||
nt|rv: in context of lead direction is more important than longer suit opp passed partner?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: why not 2 @S? |pg||
nt|blewah: OK, as a spec's information, they play weak NT and 4+@d, so N decided to pass in the previous board|pg||
nt|blewah: 13-15NT to be precised|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S would pull to 4@C or 3NT to play?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: favourable lead and all over.|pg||
nt|psridhar: weak hand = they are likely to win declaration probably|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: michaels |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we call ours Truscott in Acol 1@S-3@S = good raise to 2|pg||
nt|panosk: i like hearts :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but as passed hand,  you need a tool with that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like that bid Gary |pg||
nt|psridhar: 50% of the time pd will be on lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kemperg: possible to give less space to opps|pg||
nt|psridhar: here smith has no problems however|pg||
nt|ssbux: 3S can be defect on trump lead|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|rnmalik: no small @S and would make.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes,  difficult.|pg||
nt|blewah: but what options does he have?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aspredicted, England did not bid 3NT on 13|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andyv:  interesting contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am somehow not a fan of opening NT with 5 major. 3NT makes 9 tricks but 4@H a superior contract.|pg||
nt|ssbux: too late now|pg||
nt|psridhar: more imps for them |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT (12-14)  2NT = diamonds, 3@D  all pass|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm hoping to spend Christmas with Fiona Brown in England - so I have NO bias :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: thanks, it works very well, of course as we play 4 card majors it guaranteed 4 card support|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kemperg: 2@S worked very well for EW here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|blewah: likely 8 trick already available for cdecl|pg||

nt|gracelin: the SJ play on first trick helped declarer to locate where the SQ is.|pg||
nt|psyck:  was not in trouble after @s lead|pg||

nt|sybarra: I think any "leaping"  should be 4 card support |pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  this hand easy to play from here...at the table, N will have problems|pg||

nt|rnmalik: That low:)|pg||

nt|andyv:  if they played ELC, then N was on track to do just that (show the 2 suits)|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are doiing fine:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed to make the contract but timing of suit play  has to be good.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E only has 6 pts |pg||
nt|twcho: east secure her contract by establishing her @d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kemperg: duck and it goes of it own>)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that the X doesnt promise a bit more |pg||
nt|sybarra: from E |pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: N's @S holding means S is not going to convert a X - and N not going to sit for @C's - so what is the point of X rather than a 2-suited bid that would surely slow S down?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: another big swing for Dutch here|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: dealing with todays preempts means you sometimes have to lower the point requirements|pg||
nt|blewah: and they are minotities in this world of modern bidding|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|panosk: tough call i have no positive answer either|pg||
nt|sybarra: from my point of view,  the X would include k of @H's for example|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont think its enough for a X |pg||
nt|sybarra: now, if playing neg frees,  perhaps he bids 3 @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe with spade tolerance he can bid 3 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but that cuts the possible @H fit|pg||
nt|rv: inspite of unlucky slam deal for English ladies, Dutch women have definitely played more consistent bridge and deserve this victory|pg||
nt|twcho: so some more imps for Netherlands|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: Something like what happened seems relatively foreseeable.|pg||
nt|andyv:  was S hand worth a 3@c bid with this vul?|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems bad but no problems now|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: tks all see you again|pg||
nt|rnmalik: undo and np:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a precision auction here |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 25 imps in 15 boards is rare these days indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow where did 5@D come from :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland could be awake by then....I am sure you will have plenty of compamy |pg||
nt|psridhar: this is an interesting sequence that partnerships will do well to discusss thoroughly - 1@H-1N-2@s- now how doesn responder proceed?|pg||
nt|babs59: I'd happily be rebidding 3NT on South if 2S is natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that hand worth 2@S is the question|pg||
nt|psridhar: one popular method is responder starts with 2N on weak hands, direct bids at 3 level are nat and forward going|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: she who must be obeyed|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 13,  stop in 4 @H was rewarded|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prefer 2@H over 1@C = 4-7 6 card suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 top honours the way I play it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not play precision,  so no clue what is best |pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@S a safety play would work.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Ian, Rashed, Aria and all the specs for joining us|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a pleasure. Off to dinner|pg||
nt|blewah: thx everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  first break for N|pg||
nt|ianmcc: don't like @d 9|pg||
nt|twcho: a healthy win by the Netherlands|pg||
nt|psridhar: evidently NS play differently( or N plays it diff from S ? )|pg||
pc|d8|nt|panosk: ne neither but 3nt looks like the gd spot to be|pg||
nt|panosk: regardless of result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mm 4 top losers and bad @C break|pg||
nt|panosk: double was inspired|pg||
nt|rv: last but not the least, our gratitude to many specs who patiently listened to all of us with their insightful comments|pg||
nt|sybarra: *company |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been informed that winners of each match get bonus points and in case of a tie both get 1/2 point. Poor losers :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will have written as well as voice commentary in round 2. Remember to use the Web client for voice commentary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is making in comfort, so an opportunity for the Swedes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: 2@S was S + minor. 3@S showed max with @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Gary and all kibs.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely we may have a new leader by the end of this board:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: confirming next round in 1 hour 41 mins and last round 2.5 hours after that|pg||

nt|andyv:  seems|pg||
nt|loe48: u cant sac alone|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: This is where new players start by taking one hook, then go for the drop on round two - have to stick to your guns and repeat it.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play to this. Thanks all CU.|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK thans Rashed, Andy, specs and operator.|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye everyone|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: actual lead helps declarer I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no it doesn't|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Absent other considerations or information.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ah did not hear Andy and price to pay. J@S duck to W and then K@S by Ace in S and home.|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s is OK but will go down as the card lies|pg||
nt|twcho: of course, it will be difficult to find the @c fit after the preemption by NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a ps thank you to Paul Hackett who had been with us earlier en route to china |pg||

nt|panosk: thx Carl, Dag and Denni|pg||

pc|d5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which way :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: x gains 100 if down 1 - loses 170 if makes - not sure that's good business...|pg||
nt|sharkey: bye |pg||

pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: slam failed on 13 all of a sudden we have a new leader|pg||
nt|blewah: how is it set up, Malik?|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers playing for 3-3 @c or any honor doubleton, doesn't work here|pg||
nt|rv: right percentage line, unlucky in my view|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as they sing, it ain't over etc....|pg||
nt|panosk: had he played heart from dummy wud have made|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this play is not good|pg||
nt|twcho: wow, will down a lot|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: so this can go -3 and jiegao still win|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|blewah: W could have ducked too though|pg||
nt|rv: Nicola Smith must switch to @s now or after winning @CQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Round 2: France vs Netherlands|pg||
nt|rv: if she fails to switch, Dekkers can make if she can smoke out @h position |pg||
