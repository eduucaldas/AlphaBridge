nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are right Joao|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: a bit cloudy in London today |pg||
nt|jfaria:  could well be a transfer, just guessing :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jfaria:  with 4 loosers hard to guess a happy ending|pg||
nt|jfaria:  same result both rooms i think|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and margin is 13 VP till 2nd placed team|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the T can be costy...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I would play 2@c to show A@d rather than 10@c because of danger of discarding @d's|pg||
nt|jfaria:  must play a @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but they might have diffrent signals|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: or @S|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  plain board for a start|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bg: good contract the old moysian fit:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  though, without N's bid, EW may well land into 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  comfortable standing|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|nt|bg: S playing for  a club honor onside this isnt going to work|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this start, S can rely on double finess in @c, but it doesn't work, unfortunately|pg||
nt|bg: W worried about possible but improbable 5 card trump stack may now switch to dia and let them ruff|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: not sure what Artu's plan is now|pg||

pc|c5|pc|dJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|bg: the spade 9 would control a heart return|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 rounds of @d could have following by 2 rounds of @c - just to become sure neither defernder has 5 spades|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all, bid and made - that matters|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  luckily. @s J is second|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  otherwise, finess is necessary now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: and @s was thrown away by N|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 4 more tricks for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Janet played 2-5-6 hearts showing no @d values but it doesnt matter|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ianmcc: it's hard to X with a void|pg||

nt|andyv:  if S bids 3@c over a dbl by N, N may be tempted to rebid @hs as the @c bid raises the value of his hand|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  took time for count 10, i suppose :) |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  present for a start for Wigoder |pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I'm impressed of Bulgarian play yesterday, they play edexcellent bridge|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kemperg: Or areplaying board 39 and 40|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: no comparison now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sfoxa:  they started from 39, indeed|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sfoxa:  looks like partscore battle, especially after W's bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  @s game for NS, no more|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: we playing 31 to 40 in this round|pg||
mb|2S|an|invitational|nt|sfoxa:  nice bid opposite passed partner - NS are out of bidding|pg||
nt|bg: this should make lose 3 hearts dia and a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  supposingly, 1@h bid was for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  20 to 20 points - Roland's favourite hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but now Janet may have trouble with bidding her hand, i suppose|pg||
nt|jfaria:  micro st by E|pg||
nt|jfaria:  stolling many @c contract to NS|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  I'd like to know the reason not to bid @s with W hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes, it was transfer|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  ok, landed safely|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|kemperg: in other systems W could do 2 @S, 4-8, 6crd|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|cT|nt|bg: wrong play now 2 clubs makes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bg: had to kill dummy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, spade return could have been better|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now will play for dropping 10@c I think|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  good play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now @h ruff and @c ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: would you have bid 3@H? not me|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bg: I agree with you Sveta I do not understand why many players will bid 1nt after 1 heart instead of 1 spade|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 4-3-3-3 split - quite OK, but this time...|pg||
nt|bg: just lead club to J and lead dia J|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  to concede 1 club at the end|pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start seemed clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  not obvious line at the table|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|kemperg: any grand is on for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  huge hand for EW|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4 now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sfoxa:  S's tiny opening allows EW staying low, I hope|pg||
nt|kemperg: but 6 is normal bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but they have to discover their might|pg||
nt|kemperg: Very distracting to hear Roland talking:):)|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|nt|kemperg: modern bidding by EW, 2@D as switch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now 4@s bid looks like obligatory|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S had been @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W should find reasons to continue the bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: how do you find @SK is missing?|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  no way - it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|kemperg: N on the brink of an invite|pg||
nt|kemperg: I couldn't|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - grand relied of a finess of trump K - isn't the good one|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl lokking for a better suit then @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  or the team match pressure worked? it seems so|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @S finesse now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after this lead he will play spades from top|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and after this start, @sK is going to take the trick - declarer may be afraid of @d ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|bg: good decision by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hot start|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H competitive, dbl = invite|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bg: aggressive E might have been better off trying 2 dia instead of 2 hearts showing 10 points or so sure spade support is weak but the alternative of 2 Hearts led them too high|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, even 2 tricks in @s for NS become problematic|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree - distribution encourages|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N just does not believe...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  yes, W could be hardly blamed for his 3@h bid - E may well have an ace more|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  EW have easy 3NT, but this juicy defence brings more |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|hT|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphznr: what would be 3@d instead of 3@h ? isnt like better /weak support with heart fit ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this agreement suits well to the situation|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and a lot of pairs playing opps suit as maximum (passed or bid) hand with fit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|bg: good thought but depends on partnership understanding Engine and caboose have to be on same track|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@h must be @h and... with 11 cards and @h fit W decided to take a chance|pg||
nt|jfaria:  this may proove expensive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a swing as expected on B 1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h4|nt|jfaria:  but B2 may even scores|pg||

pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  and this line may well reduce declarer's tricks with 9 only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may clear @d now|pg||

pc|c8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's good bid opposite passed partner - when no game is in view|pg||
