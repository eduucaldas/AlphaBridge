nt|peachy: Lively looking hand to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||

nt|jcwla: If this auction is to make any sense?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or do we just have it all wrong?|pg||
nt|rv: South will double this, could be phantom save though|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@Sis a two-suiter, known as Muiderberg in the Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Routine 4@S for NS.|pg||
nt|panosk: double is support i guess meaning 3hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with all bidding, a good stop, looks like just a make|pg||

nt|andyv:  watch out Jordan...they're moving faster and faster|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, but then come the undos -- no new bids, just an alert.|pg||
nt|rv: important system aspect for partnerships to discuss? 3@c could potentially show both majors with longer OM (@s here)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E trying to slow the train down|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think EW in CR are going to have a chat about this auction.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has a 3 loser hand...they should reach game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should 2@S not be forcing on the auction in the closed room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it is not, you have to bid 4@H over 1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Only on this planet, Roland, not on several others.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 2@C followed by something|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kemperg: wise to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...500-800 certainly possible in 5@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was -3 in the CR so still gains 3 imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd have a hard time bidding with the E hand on that aucition in the CR...only 100% force to cue bid and then bid @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: hi all!|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Denni|pg||

nt|loe48: Hi Dennis welcome :)|pg||
nt|panosk: even 7 @D is makeable as card lie but i doubt they will get there|pg||
mb|6H|nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||
nt|andyv:  E here decides to show the @c stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W decides to dive off the deep end|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: last set was 44-39 heaps of imps traded|pg||
nt|jcwla: To quote "Miracle Mile," What's the hurry, Harry?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: K&R has that last S hand at a generous 8.6: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ83+Q2+873+Q973 |pg||
nt|panosk: now secured , the friendly lie that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the difference between 6@H now and 6@H over1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will likely duck on sp  |pg||
nt|sybarra: *duck one |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I am not surprosed, it looked like a 7 count at first glance|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT seems like the field resting spot here.|pg||
nt|peachy: *surprised|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi aria|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she might as well have bid 6@H directly|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps less likely to make now?|pg||
nt|ssbux: why 3C, either 2c or 4c will be better and not misleading as notrump probe|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  this looks more scientific, Roland...esp. when her partner showed her useful values in the @c suit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a decent save non-vul here as 4@H easy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcwla: I am guessing that W took 3NT to show the high end of a 1@H-response in values.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|panosk: redouble showing 1st round control in @S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: at these colours asking for too much. pass the right decision.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice auction|pg||
nt|kerasidis: very usufull....|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately game not reached CR|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|panosk: even possible void (3@S)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|blewah: from the 3@h response to 2@s I think NS play 2/1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  nothing left but the @h gess and N may even lead that|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi aria|pg||
nt|blewah: Hi Andy|pg||

mb|p|nt|panosk: N doubled 5@H so defence was easy in 6@S in closed room|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is a slam I'd rather be in|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: You are unlucky if you go down in 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you will with both finesses off|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  trick is for NS to stay low |pg||
nt|rv: red blooded pre-empt by Marion Michielsen|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: On the cards and S's opening, 6@H is not an outre spot on 2, but the best-bid hand award awaits further nominations.|pg||
nt|rv: what is 4@d here by Smith, some play it as good raise in @Cs, a few others play it as both majors|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer to play 4@d as both majors 5-5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E has a solid road here, showing @S and forcing now, can show the @H later.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: if S bids his hearts.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ianmcc: partial for N/S but they could get higher|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c bergen I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@D misguided in third seat.  It's their hand - put some pressure on.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now, let's talk about this double -- or the lack of a double by the N hand in similar situations.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats what i call trump support |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and does, finally a 10 point opener gets a good result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beegen raise I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bergen|pg||
mb|5H|nt|blewah: and S decided he likes his hand a lot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C was bergen as I look at it and S upgraded his hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need this trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D Ace and @H back:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Anybody have a problem with 3@D?|pg||
nt|rv: this slam is worse than 1 of 2 finesses, if @h finesse is off chances are not very bright|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the defense should be pretty easy as long as W doesn't get overly anxious and cashes out early|pg||
nt|ssbux: another unlucky slam for EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's all coming up orange so far.|pg||
nt|rv: still very decent slam just on @h finesse|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes very decent, but unlucky|pg||
mb|6N|nt|kiwibridge: looks like -1 again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep   could be -2 if they can get second ruff |pg||
nt|panosk: @D2 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd ruff = the same 2 trump tricks he started with?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: You and your favorite partner need to have agreement on what it means: does it ask for a @D lead (so that if you don't double you are suggesting a different lead) or does it say "I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: have a 2@D rebid that they stole"?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Plenty of room for both major K's to be in N, let alone just the @HK.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: if @h finesse is off, you need @s finesse on and black suit squeeze|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|rv: atleast 55% or so |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|jcwla: I prefer the latter meaning and trust that pd will lead my suit in the absence of a clearly better alternative; however, I do have some pds who require the double if I want the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: lead of that suit.|pg||
nt|peachy: Again, remembering Precision context|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|panosk: bad break in trumps 4@H had no chance gd game though|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D isnt simple support in @D must be 2way checkback with game forc hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  at 50 a pop, down 1 or 2 shouldn't make much difference as it's almost impossible to stop in 2@s or 2@h with the NS hand|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably another push |pg||
nt|ssbux: ten of D, signal for S?|pg||

nt|panosk: 2-1 is 78% it shud be|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: board 2 = push :)|pg||

mb|1D|nt|kemperg: @C 10 discard was :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: And I agree with E's bidding up until the self-raise to 4.|pg||
nt|panosk: absolutely|pg||
nt|sybarra: S coming in?  and how best?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should die at 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Exactly|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this lies badly for N/S|pg||
mb|d|nt|panosk: this is the best way if you play it  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C must be conventional for majors?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nicola Smith and Sally Brock are very experienced, so they will get on with life and not let these results affect them|pg||
nt|rv: luck does even out in long tourney, British ladies should be resilient here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: Precision NS then Raija?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW don't have enough to compete at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kerasidis: dont like emmediate 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: North's 1n shows 18-19 here|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally 9 tricks are available for N-S with lucky lie of red suits|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: The bridge Championship is being played at Shenzen, a beautiful city adjacent to Hongkong. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: catching up the scores now|pg||

nt|kerasidis: as it could be with weaker habnds|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hands|pg||

nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||

nt|kerasidis: there are partners with great aggrements with such hands...2@c or 3@c|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi carl|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  everyone wiling to play 1N except the author of the bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will be fortunate to go down 1|pg||
nt|ssbux: very lucky 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: n/S being talked out of good spot in @S's|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: confirmed by a spec, thx|pg||
nt|peachy: I really do not have any first hand knowledge, but looks like Precision|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C shows more high cards indeed so in case EW go to 5 level N doent have a clue about pards hand|pg||
nt|loe48: many use 2nt as good raise in this pos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Carl|pg||
nt|loe48: invite + in spade|pg||
nt|panosk: with the 4@S bid that is, agree with Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes many alternative bids...depends on partners aggrements|pg||
nt|kemperg: to much in @C nothing in red suits, 4@S good for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panosk: N was a bit conservative for me shud have tried 2 spades|pg||
nt|rv: anyone open 2n (20-21) with North hand, what does K-R say?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Michielsen showing 18-19 balanced with her 1NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ianmcc: @d most likely, will cost a trick|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect K-R will show more than 19 hcp for North hand, possibly not enough for 2n opening|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  A@h and @h|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: 20.45 per KR|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|peachy: This event does not have website or any other information online|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: however can't beat 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: one of those hands that cries out for a trump lead|pg||
nt|loe48: but..as crazy cards can be..opponents may have contract too..so 4s is also blocking alot same it can make|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|panosk: no |pg||
nt|panosk: with @D 2-2 and J10 @C dropping they can even make 3@C :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the uppercut works !|pg||
nt|sybarra: miight get a trump now |pg||
nt|rv: will anyone in panel open 2n?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: I think 3@C is better as N will know S also have defensive values. I wud bid 4@S without @CKJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kerasidis: in one of them doubled could gain some imps|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  making 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would only because I hate the rebids|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||

pc|h2|pc|d4|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||

nt|kerasidis: good question|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: yes and @S would restrict S to +!.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 10 well-deserved IMPs to ZhuJiang there for getting to and making the @H game.|pg||
nt|sybarra: all 3 level contracts in last hand -1 |pg||
nt|andyv:  part score battle|pg||
nt|sharkey: cant be if S bids 4@S directly|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NT range possibly 14-16, but we have no evidence other than bidding and the fat they play Precision :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's fine otherwise. I have a @D suit that is well worth mentioning (playing in, leading) and I don't expect the counterpart to bid 2NT, so I would open 1@D.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but most like a push board even after opening 2NT|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sybarra: 3 @S's as well |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: appears we have now lost score comparisons which makes life harder|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rv: 2@d by East could show no preference to majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d here...pick your major|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: at last a swing on 3 NS pushed to 5 level by W's 5@D bid then X'd|pg||
nt|panosk: had to cash A@S first to defeat 3@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D forcing Stayman?|pg||
nt|sharkey: gf|pg||
nt|kerasidis: can anyone inform us pls|pg||
nt|kerasidis: from the kibbs |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|peachy: This is an invitational event, 8 sponsors with their teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: for me 4@S can be 6small spades and some single, but is a matter of approach |pg||
nt|rv: 2@d shows equal length (2-2 or 3-3) in majors usually|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I was kind enough not to say anything about hte 1NT last hand, but the words are just bubbling on my tongue|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is just cruising for a bruising here.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H=4 card support good hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  no battle at all as S decided to open a light NT|pg||
nt|loe48: true|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume 1 NT =13-15 or 12-14|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a nice advantage of a system that leaves that step in between.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is exactly why you need 2@C for the majors, and not 2@D or 2@H as in Capp and DONT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: now he has to make 6 |pg||
nt|ianmcc: could be up for another -100|pg||
nt|loe48: 13-15|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner must be able to ask for the longer with 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when she has equal length|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|jcwla: Has anyone heard from Basia lately?  We need her.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I was sent a story yestaerday on Barry cranes rules for finding the missing Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: with nothing to go on |pg||
nt|sharkey: West made slam try in @D but E turned it down.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: do tell Gary |pg||
nt|rv: low @h best now|pg||
nt|rv: still likely to be trick short|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: 6@D not unreasonable with decent trump break|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kemperg: same in CR|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: 2@s, 2@h and 1 trick in each minor for defense|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in a Major it is always over the Jack he claimed|pg||
nt|sybarra: its something about if they dont cover they dont have it?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and it worked here|pg||
nt|panosk: ah yes and only played with people who aplied his rule too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: apparently his partners were forced to follow his rule|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: he certainly played enough hands to verify a theory |pg||

pc|c6|pc|s6|pg||

nt|kerasidis: with a little try...cards lie favourable except dias|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kemperg: copipying a terrible bid:(|pg||
nt|sybarra: stuffed N in |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Helen Sobel also had a good method: she raised her dress above the knees, the man who looked did not hold the Queen :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  :) |pg||
nt|panosk: i mean if you get there you will have to make :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Playing highest @S to prevent short honors from taking tricks to extent possible and draw trumps like so.|pg||
nt|kemperg: destroyd the entrys for double hook in @D, 11 instead of 12 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blewah: hard for W to find E entry |pg||

nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: interesting point of theory brought out by knowledgable spec on 1n-(2@c*-majors)-p-(2@d*-equal length), O/Cer bids his weaker major with 5-5 since opps likely to lead trumps and ...|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes they got too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @s was not such a bad spot |pg||

nt|kerasidis: now they discuss if WE has 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: then I understand...|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: E had a good rebid on 1major|pg||
mb|1D|nt|panosk: they might even have 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h vs 4@s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcwla: Yes, far more worthy of a bid than the 1@D S egested on 1.|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl could be showing majors, a common def to strong C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same story can be repeated in CR:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect the CR auction to be widely duplicated.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: 7 imps quite a cruel penalty really|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2@c bid was reasonable on previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thought it should be only -1|pg||
nt|blewah: i think that's the most likely scenario, Rashed|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play 2@c (fourth suit) as Inv+ and not unconditional GF here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 1NT best now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing is ideal|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: DF makes 7@D on this hand :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 2@c as Inv+ with opener to show 2 ranges (11-bad 14) and good 14-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: looks like a club system in action |pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe over 2NT an accepting 3@H and then back to 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Surely N is minimum for the original X?  Oh well, S would have done anyway and maybe should have to begin with.|pg||
nt|sybarra: on this bd|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11+11 = game vul I think|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 1-2 down|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Prec|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't understand these methods :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so bidding never got to the 4 level|pg||
nt|panosk: but +300 is much beter than -100|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: 4@D x was -3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A nice way to resolve the angst about the imperfect 1NT rebid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: would you open W hand?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think I wud|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: depends on my mood, if serious no :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: best contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we warn them about 6 @D|pg||
nt|panosk: 6nt looks gd as cards lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 12 in NT again a friendly K@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D I'm told is GF stayman, why he'd do it with only one major I don't know|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT in W or 2@D?|pg||
nt|blewah: NS would go for more if they know they also have fit in @c |pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: @CQ likely here to try to create an entry.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: quanti raise |pg||
nt|panosk: the friendliest kind |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 5  6 @H a push |pg||
nt|henryb:  6N would look good wherever the @hK was: 2@s, 1@h, 5@c and 4@d tricks unless the clubs do not behave|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Henry :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  gm Shirley @h|pg||
nt|panosk: hi henry|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 0745 for us here, hence the gm |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or the @D do not behave H|pg||
nt|henryb:  you have 4@d tricks on any break: look at the spots|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm watching live cricket from England I bet Roalnd is too|pg||
nt|panosk: the real question here is shud he accept?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland it probably at the match  |pg||
nt|henryb:  England - India?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, and England again amassing a huge 1st innings score|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we in deep thought? or losing conex?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think thought |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D for me, welcome Rashed :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Playing 2/1, I think 2D is automatic|pg||
nt|rv: best lead, now if North can win and switch to @h, I suspect Smith will cash 3@hs and switch to @s|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|peachy: We dont have access to the player's system details|pg||

nt|peachy: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|blewah: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome also aria|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Gary and Raija.|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Gary|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nice play by N.|pg||
nt|rv: good play and defense|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: they'll live to regret the result anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: I am happy that we now have more commentators, I was hoping to leave soon. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the more the merrier it is for me, one is quite lonely|pg||
nt|andyv:  since EW can make game, was E's 3@h bid conservative?|pg||
nt|kemperg: doubt, but we would end in 2|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wouldt either|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: 4@H makes whereas @S does not.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooer|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is the word oof|pg||
nt|panosk: that was a danger after 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N should possibly be converting|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see he should but at the table not sure you know to do that |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|panosk: bad lead for decl cant see bare K@H |pg||
nt|peachy: I think four is the perfect number, three is great too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|blewah: W bids reds and NT, E blacks only|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely end up playing 6NT or @D, as per their system.|pg||
nt|blewah: sure they are on the same wave |pg||
nt|ssbux: famous dish in Beijing, the Peking duck|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: high quality bridge as mentioned by Roland right at the start of this broadcast|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: The least expected.:)|pg||
nt|blewah: i was wrong, ok.|pg||
nt|peachy: G'night all, enjoy the match!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesn't look like it thought E was heading for 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Bye Raija, nice sleep.|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW plays 2/1 I think - East showed limit raise with 3 trumps so they stopped in 3@S|pg||
nt|loe48: its not an opener 1,2 seat imo|pg||
nt|kerasidis: aceless with no alternative bid|pg||
nt|loe48: 3rd seat 1s okay|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: can he do 6 @d only loding 1 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be able to make it as E also has 4@C|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kemperg: N has enough to try make life diff. for strong @C|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes agree|pg||
nt|rv: now another @c, if finessed by Smith, North can win and back a @h, still declarer can get home for 9 tricks with @s breaking|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to say I prefer even the @C5 to the 7 for the opening salvo.|pg||
nt|rv: yes I like second best leads from poor suit, many experts even prefer attitude leads against nt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: Here you can put on your best air of faux innocence but it's kind of a readout.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panosk: its not i agree , but im not always rational on table :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: dag i have seen you open weaker hands in 3 seat :)|pg||
nt|loe48: 7 hps :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think most players wud open - but Pass will get many votes too|pg||
nt|panosk: 3rd seat is quite different|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S 2@C gf or inv+ with 3@Ss, 2@D, less then 16 pts, 2@S inv with 3crd. end|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kemperg: no option for N i think|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rv: against nt, many folks don't show count by leading 4th best or 3/5, leads are attitude showing interest (low card lead) or disinterest (high card lead) in continuing suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: the 2nd 13 imp swing to jiegao|pg||

nt|andyv:  this one can make 6 but hard to get to|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I think they've found one they can't miss.|pg||

nt|ianmcc: doing well for 450 odd|pg||
nt|blewah: as you predicted|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ianmcc: I still think it's a bad 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should get them to 6|pg||
nt|blewah: another example that a singleton meets xxx can be very valuable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi=weak on one major|pg||
nt|ianmcc: who wants to be in 6?|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sybarra: like a wk 2 bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree, no harm to pass 1@H and wait for P's response who is not a passed hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  still, need to guess @s Q and need K@d on side...so not a great slam|pg||
nt|rv: 2n seems to be jacoby showing 4+@s, 12+hcp|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|peachy: E in good position to check on keycards |pg||
nt|rv: seems to be conventional (possibly home-grown) treatment subsequently|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed, 3NT .|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2N guarantees 4@s...many play garbage stayman and would have to bid 2@s with S hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|panosk: E doesnt know which major but he correctly thinks its spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are various methods, my multi 2@D = weak 2 either major OR 20-22 with a 5 card suit OR and 8+ playing tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a lot of folks include a strong bid in multi  |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not as a rule with most pard's I play with on bbo |pg||
nt|andyv:  but momentum may put them there|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: or 2 strong as in NZ version|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may try 5@d now|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2 finesses.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kemperg: no, with garbage you have both majors and pass 2@H|pg||
nt|panosk: yes there are various version , also 1 with strong 3 suiter|pg||
nt|ianmcc: and drop|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: next|pg||
nt|sybarra: in general,  multi is not/can not be played in usa|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  W must have realized the 4@c bid was already an overbid and did well to stop in 4|pg||
nt|blewah: agree, 4@c was an upgrade|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|kiwibridge: I see 11 tricks, 12 made in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: funny USA, trying to protect the innocent, actually it's easy enough to defend|pg||
mb|6C|nt|rv: we need help from operator or spectators to decipher subsequent auction post 2n|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  right...if they had garbage hand...but since 2N over 2@h would deny a 4 card major, they would have to bid 2@s with the invite hand and 4 spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmc: 2NT show 4 support|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: agree Gary,  and many have heard me say I played in Neth.  and evey jr, youth and granny had a defense to multi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On the bidding CR had better chance of playing 6@D.|pg||
nt|rv: conventional (read traditional) response to jacoby 2n is 3 level bids show stiff, 3M denies stiff with extra length, 3n shows extras hcp possibly 15-17 (maybe 5422), 4 level bids ...|pg||
nt|rv: shows second 5 card suit, 4M shows sub-min/min opening with no redeeming feature|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to beg off here, thanks all, enjoy the rest.|pg||
nt|rv: there are plenty of variations to traditional jacoby and conventional jacoby is hardly played by most of the experts nowadays|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  Not true, Shirley. Multi can be used in any team game of 6+ boards where the players are "Flight A"|pg||
nt|panosk: yes if you dont know what to bid wait till they say their suit and then take action like double |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: our Juniors love to play and defend it|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jcwla: Relaxing to know off a keycard, don't have to think.  Can't complain about this pace - halfway through in 40 mins.|pg||

nt|andyv:  NS should have no trouble getting to 6...question is if they have the tools to get to 7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: too many tricks.|pg||
nt|rv: well bid nonetheless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: ok|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panosk: the one i like and its completely banned is 2@H weak in unknown major|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|panosk: thats really dangerous|pg||
nt|rv: last part of last auction can be explained 4NT = RKCB 5@D = 1 key cd 5@H = asking 2nd rd control 6@C = yes + 3rd rd control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D = 1 major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Multi defence to 1NT|pg||
nt|rv: sry 5@h is @sQ ask, 6@c shows @SQ and @CK|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: back to this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: nice pANOS|pg||
nt|sharkey: You open N hand 1@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brock must be happy to learn that partner has a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Panos sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a dangerous 5@D bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @C holding in N hand and @h holding in S hand will be hard to describe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least her majors are equally good|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kemperg: nice bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H now competitive or inviting?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Precision 2@C here, 6+ in the absence of a major, now 7+  NS will shortly be in game.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S is good raise of @D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since about 60% of our tables are now in team events, either 2-day KOs or Swiss, its not true that it is even close to barred|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: thats tempting :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i would|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or is it bad|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I don't like vul 2 level O/C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you take the money as South or just bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|rv: sitting here I will surely take money|pg||
nt|rv: at the table, I will contemplate a bit more and still take the money|pg||
nt|rv: on accurate defense it could go for 800?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price right for a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all Thx Roland|pg||
nt|rv: Hi P.Sridhar, gm|pg||
nt|ssbux: welcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  gm P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am in full agreement with RV there- odds do not favour that 2@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: GM Andy/RV :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: high level competitors have tools these days to reach their contracts even after 2@d/2@s, so some usefulness of intervention is already lost|pg||
nt|psridhar: and the risk of going for 500/800 exixts still|pg||
nt|psridhar: exists|pg||
nt|rv: 800 is not possible for N-S, on perfect defense declarer could still get out for -500, not very costly|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kemperg: dbl should be inviting for me|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Too good for 2@H?|pg||
nt|loe48: to strong for 2h non vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Logically, it should be that for others, too|pg||
nt|loe48: if vul 2h okay|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, weak 2 is 4-8 with green against red|pg||
nt|rv: Brock must have heaved sigh of relief|pg||
nt|psridhar: meanwhile appreciate how much better the E hand is if one of those minor honors she has -is in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least this can't be misinterpreted as a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: pref both:)|pg||
nt|rv: yes I would O/C with KQJ9XX, AX, XXX, XX even at these colors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Marion may think that this is a slam invite since Dekkers did not bid 4@H the round before|pg||
nt|psridhar: and that hand also is 10 HCP :)|pg||
nt|rv: and still may not with just J or Q in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand her way of thinking|pg||
nt|rv: 5 level is safe, no harm even if Marion bids 4@s|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|panosk: weak 2 is out of the question in any vul for me|pg||
nt|loe48: vul vs non vul i open 2h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: just a max in other circumstances for me|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers will sign-off in 5@h quickly|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brock's pass of X must show @d , 2@d X is possibly a good spot for EW ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not bid 4@H before? Double + 4@H slam invitational she must be thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kemperg: agree with you on the last hand, 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  W better lead a trump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can borrow one from E.:)|pg||
nt|panosk: if you need to open 1 is much beter |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  anyone like N's 4@s bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still time for brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps S should keycard and then sign off in 5@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: Roland's point is very valid -but before that we should know whats X of 2@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding 5@h directly might give N some encouragement to bid on|pg||
nt|rv: Marion Michielsen has an excellent hand opposite unilateral jump to 4@h, a) no wastage in @h, b)4 trumps and c) all those controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double of 2@D would usually be "I want to double at least one major"|pg||
nt|psridhar: if it was a value showing X , N is justified in slam try; if it was a take out X, i think she has less cause|pg||
nt|psridhar: oh penalty X ?|pg||
nt|rv: I would treat North's hand as super-max for the auction so far|pg||
mb|5N|nt|kemperg: N agrees|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would not be my choice with 4-card @H's but they're obv on the same wavelength.|pg||
nt|peachy: North is delighted to go, five good trumps and a singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and what % are Flight A ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he can't have liked his 2@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 2 aces S must bid 5NT. GS.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I suspect that not many in North America and Europe have heard about the city Shenzhen in the Guangdong province, the venue for this tournament. Shenzhen has more than 10 million ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: inhabitants!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @C lead would be interesting.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if K@c is lead, E needs to rise with A and return @d|pg||
nt|psridhar: N has a difficult task -if she is required to guess that her partner made a "penalty oreineted X" and changed her mind later|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|andyv:  now, no worries for 5@d:)|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure if N-S playing any last train cue bids, if they play Dekkers could have bid 5@d with any sort of interest and her 5@h would state I have no interest|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h = long @H, with that suit, she couldnt possibly have expected to defend 2@H X|pg||
nt|psridhar: good, thoughtful lead -will set 5N here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one probably won't make the textbooks|pg||
nt|blewah: and 5 card support|pg||
nt|rv: yes great lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|jaapfr: what a horror double|pg||

pc|d4|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rv: North should duck this to restrict damage|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  down 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may have been a battle between 500 and 550|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: 6N was indeed found CR for another 2 imps|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  In Swiss, about a third; in KOs about a quarter; but anyone is allowed to play Flight A in a Swiss|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bill tells me CR in 6@C|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rnmalik: vul against non -vul.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so EW probably saved a couple of imps by pulling 5@dx|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: you see luck has already evened out, E-W bid a good slam on deal 3 which went down, here 2@d O/C has caused problem to opps who have overreached|pg||
pc|s9|nt|blewah: from +400 to -130|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c2|nt|jcwla: N is known to have real @H's here - there was a hand in the 2010 Rosenblum final (written up by Howard Weinstein in the August Bridge World) where a 2@D preempt was doubled on a ...|pg||

nt|sybarra: right 10 |pg||
nt|psridhar: yes-so slam on with less one card less|pg||
nt|rv: even if South had one of the minor honor cards missing in PS's example hand, LS would be cold|pg||

mb|4H|nt|rv: only point for consideration, would South have bid 5@d as last train cue bid with such hands?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: weird in my opinion....N doesnt know south's 18 points hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: sometimes you get to play it here |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: cant be all bad|pg||
nt|rv: East's hand just about minimum for t/o with this shape (4333) or would panel require a bit more?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@h is truly a dreamer's bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Rashed good to have your company @H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  you dream that S will have the right dummy for you|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: and if pard stronger i dont mind playing higher than 1|pg||
nt|blewah: and he proved he was right by misguessing the Q trump :)|pg||
nt|rv: no @c wastage and approx 14 hcp is my requirement with 4M333 shape for t/o double of minor opening|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: I'm not privvy to their agreements nor that steady on Precision, what might 4NT mean I wonder|pg||
nt|sybarra: that puts it to declarer |pg||
nt|panosk: yes shud be torchoured a bit for his bid :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: how ever you spell tortured,  that is being done|pg||
nt|panosk: i meant tortured of course|pg||
nt|panosk: E carefully took with A@H so no clues|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N of course should pull to 2@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think with so many english words it is difficult for europeans |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: CR in 5@S X I'm told so another swing coming|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid but makes 6@H as the cards are placed.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we have words that sound the same and spelled differently |pg||
pc|d3|nt|psridhar: factor the passed hand pd in rv :)|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D is GF checkback, 2@s showed 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers can play this deal easily, she knows location of all honor cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer needs to play @s twice and @h once - 3 entries to dummy needs and she has 3 alright|pg||
nt|rv: she is thinking of catering to 4-1 @s break with @SAQ8X with East|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: E did not go for the possible penalty pass in W, |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not a peep from EW to worry them either|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c forced 2@d I think|pg||
nt|blewah: XYZ convention or some sort|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree with 2nd double from South then N shud act|pg||

nt|andyv:  float the 10|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kemperg: No opening in W so perhaps good decision|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of bidding being done |pg||
nt|andyv:  looking at all 4 hands, EW are hard pressed to bid and make anything|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: now EW make 2NT on defence|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: only 10 tricks because of @c blockage?|pg||
nt|rv: East win second @s and play back second @d|pg||

nt|psridhar: but 4@S will make always|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  no useful pitch coming on J@c|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kerasidis: opps play weak nt so double can be weaker...that was my point|pg||
nt|loe48: 15+|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  somewhere the wheels came off or maybe W just decided to chance it|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: the defence slip from grace|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|blewah: not easy to find low @s from W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no small @S and would make.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes,  difficult.|pg||
nt|blewah: but what options does he have?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  interesting contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am somehow not a fan of opening NT with 5 major. 3NT makes 9 tricks but 4@H a superior contract.|pg||
nt|ssbux: too late now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: thanks, it works very well, of course as we play 4 card majors it guaranteed 4 card support|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S worked very well for EW here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|blewah: likely 8 trick already available for cdecl|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 or  5 card majors |pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: indeed I agree|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  on Board 11, N was on lead against 4@h and led the A@s, killing any chances to set the contract|pg||

pc|hT|nt|andyv:  @d lead probably would have held this to 3 but not much more for the defense|pg||

nt|panosk: and W shud pass|pg||
nt|panosk: i think best line is small spade from dummy|pg||
nt|loe48: yes if need to open it self..but last you do after checking spots|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Who gets the charge there?|pg||
nt|panosk: i dont like playing clubs either |pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  mastercard|pg||
nt|andyv:  no charge...NS very aggressive...didn't work|pg||
nt|andyv:  this hand a bit testy for NS....need to stop low or defend|pg||
nt|kerasidis: north could have the last trump|pg||
nt|loe48: you can play on honor double on both sides with success|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: undo|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: S has a nice hand in context of the X  -- arguably didn't give pd a lot of leeway but possibly N could show 2-suiter instead?|pg||
nt|panosk: constructive bids shud stay lower, in my opinion|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree panos |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no opening S no preempt W|pg||
nt|rv: North will bid game if South competes to 3@h via lebensohl or rubensohl|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rnmalik: routine hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: might make 1NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  this hand easy to play from here...at the table, N will have problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you have to have discussion with pard,  as to what bids mean as passed hand |pg||
nt|rnmalik: any major suit contract losing 3 aces only:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think S passed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That low:)|pg||
nt|blewah: pass?|pg||
nt|panosk: but its not beter than finess|pg||
nt|rv: I presume 3@d is transfer to @h (rubensohl)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  doubld dummy 4@c probably only goes down one|pg||
nt|andyv:  double|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  right Rashed:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: alas|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: disappointing|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe one of the few pairs in the world that can stop at 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: yes,3d have alert later|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: undo pl.|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think E bid 5@s|pg||
nt|panosk: double or 3@S with W hand?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I prefer double|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: no remedy for being conservative and losing a vul game.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzku: sry|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: sry:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: it's the first time i do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: except when pard misreads it|pg||
nt|sybarra: that maybe is result of X |pg||
nt|sybarra: W had best find 4 @S (imo)|pg||
nt|panosk: what do you think about double as t/o from E straight after 3@C?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS almost make 3N on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I prefer 3 @S,  not resulting,  but I do not have 4 @H's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ideal Panos, says I have @H + @D + tolerance for @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pause - North "knows" where @SJ is...?|pg||
nt|loe48: well it was a marked stop as i dont like to see..but poor connection? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: May have been better take 1st @S trick here as @S blocked|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|loe48: but pretty much be the same as have entress anyways|pg||
nt|kerasidis: could even give the impression that he has Ajx in spdes :)'|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  if they played ELC, then N was on track to do just that (show the 2 suits)|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are doiing fine:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed to make the contract but timing of suit play  has to be good.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E only has 6 pts |pg||
pc|h8|nt|kemperg: duck and it goes of it own>)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that the X doesnt promise a bit more |pg||
nt|sybarra: from E |pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: N's @S holding means S is not going to convert a X - and N not going to sit for @C's - so what is the point of X rather than a 2-suited bid that would surely slow S down?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rv: another big swing for Dutch here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: dealing with todays preempts means you sometimes have to lower the point requirements|pg||
nt|blewah: and they are minotities in this world of modern bidding|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|blewah: minorities|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panosk: tough call i have no positive answer either|pg||
nt|sybarra: from my point of view,  the X would include k of @H's for example|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont think its enough for a X |pg||
nt|sybarra: now, if playing neg frees,  perhaps he bids 3 @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe with spade tolerance he can bid 3 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but that cuts the possible @H fit|pg||
nt|rv: inspite of unlucky slam deal for English ladies, Dutch women have definitely played more consistent bridge and deserve this victory|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Something like what happened seems relatively foreseeable.|pg||
nt|andyv:  was S hand worth a 3@c bid with this vul?|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems bad but no problems now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even now makes.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: @D switch.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  with everyon play 2way new minor and xyz and pdq, etc....2@c has almost become non existent as a spot to play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  S will have to be careful here not to lose 3@c tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: depends on  meaning of the dbl|pg||
nt|jcwla: We know from 14 that the double promises short @C's|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks everybody, g'night :)|pg||
