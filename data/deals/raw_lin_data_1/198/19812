nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are right Joao|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: a bit cloudy in London today |pg||
nt|jfaria:  could well be a transfer, just guessing :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jfaria:  with 4 loosers hard to guess a happy ending|pg||
nt|jfaria:  same result both rooms i think|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bg: good spot for first board s/b 110|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sfoxa:  and margin is 13 VP till 2nd placed team|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the T can be costy...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I would play 2@c to show A@d rather than 10@c because of danger of discarding @d's|pg||
nt|jfaria:  must play a @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but they might have diffrent signals|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: or @S|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

pc|dA|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bg: good contract the old moysian fit:)|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  took time for count 10, i suppose :) |pg||

nt|vugraphznr: I'm impressed of Bulgarian play yesterday, they play edexcellent bridge|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kemperg: Or areplaying board 39 and 40|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kemperg: no comparison now|pg||
nt|bg: 2nd hand should also be +110:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sfoxa:  they started from 39, indeed|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  looks like partscore battle, especially after W's bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  @s game for NS, no more|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphznr: we playing 31 to 40 in this round|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  nice bid opposite passed partner - NS are out of bidding|pg||
nt|bg: this should make lose 3 hearts dia and a spade|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  supposingly, 1@h bid was for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  20 to 20 points - Roland's favourite hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but now Janet may have trouble with bidding her hand, i suppose|pg||
nt|jfaria:  micro st by E|pg||
nt|jfaria:  stolling many @c contract to NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bg: oops a little GGRESSIVE|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm. not impossible|pg||
nt|bg: aggressive|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  I'd like to know the reason not to bid @s with W hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes, it was transfer|pg||
nt|jfaria:  or even a @h game|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, landed safely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S woke up in time :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  I wonder, which card E chooses for return |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  oh, I anticipated @c|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sfoxa:  yes, defenders have no chance to @c trick |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C start needed|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  admit, this time the lay of the cards isn't pretty good for EW, but playing 2@s seems good|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bg: W duck one dia continue club Q no play|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|kemperg: in other systems W could do 2 @S, 4-8, 6crd|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C must have been gameforcing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bg: wrong play now 2 clubs makes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bg: had to kill dummy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, spade return could have been better|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now will play for dropping 10@c I think|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  good play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now @h ruff and @c ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: would you have bid 3@H? not me|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bg: I agree with you Sveta I do not understand why many players will bid 1nt after 1 heart instead of 1 spade|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 4-3-3-3 split - quite OK, but this time...|pg||
nt|bg: just lead club to J and lead dia J|pg||
nt|kemperg: would have been interesting here:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may overruf, but has to play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jfaria:  very brave i guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: not me|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: no defense any more|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  I should consider this approach - positive bid having an ace in hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bg: silly defense|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pc|c3|nt|kemperg: just collect AK of @H|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  to concede 1 club at the end|pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start seemed clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  not obvious line at the table|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kemperg: any grand is on for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  huge hand for EW|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S's tiny opening allows EW staying low, I hope|pg||
nt|kemperg: but 6 is normal bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but they have to discover their might|pg||
nt|kemperg: Very distracting to hear Roland talking:):)|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|kemperg: modern bidding by EW, 2@D as switch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now 4@s bid looks like obligatory|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S had been @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W should find reasons to continue the bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: how do you find @SK is missing?|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  no way - it seems|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|kemperg: N on the brink of an invite|pg||
nt|kemperg: I couldn't|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - grand relied of a finess of trump K - isn't the good one|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl lokking for a better suit then @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  or the team match pressure worked? it seems so|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @S finesse now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after this lead he will play spades from top|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and after this start, @sK is going to take the trick - declarer may be afraid of @d ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|bg: good decision by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hot start|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H competitive, dbl = invite|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bg: aggressive E might have been better off trying 2 dia instead of 2 hearts showing 10 points or so sure spade support is weak but the alternative of 2 Hearts led them too high|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, even 2 tricks in @s for NS become problematic|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  agree - distribution encourages|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N just does not believe...|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  yes, W could be hardly blamed for his 3@h bid - E may well have an ace more|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|sfoxa:  EW have easy 3NT, but this juicy defence brings more |pg||
pc|h9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bg: E should balance I think usually bad result to let opps play 1h-2h|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|vugraphznr: what would be 3@d instead of 3@h ? isnt like better /weak support with heart fit ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this agreement suits well to the situation|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and a lot of pairs playing opps suit as maximum (passed or bid) hand with fit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bg: good thought but depends on partnership understanding Engine and caboose have to be on same track|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, this time 7 tricks are in view - not bad|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jfaria:  2@h must be @h and... with 11 cards and @h fit W decided to take a chance|pg||
nt|jfaria:  this may proove expensive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a swing as expected on B 1|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|jfaria:  but B2 may even scores|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  end is good - everything's good|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  opne room started with  9 - so we have first comparison|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I think W forgot about colours...|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1D|nt|bg: Board one S had easy 3 nt with spade lead|pg||

mb|5C|nt|sfoxa:  oh - no need even|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: do you agree with S pass after 2@s?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  probably thet are playing variable nt or a strong believe not to open 1nt with 5 c M|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hard to say|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS may win 6@c on @s guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5@c seems safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  with N as declarer, contract is safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  same for 3NT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|sfoxa:  what would you lead with W hand after such an auction?|pg||
nt|kemperg: W almost endplayed now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kemperg: @C for me|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @s for me - both of no use this time|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d looks as the same pain|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kemperg: no, dnl for me|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: btw 2@s was a good decision, may would bid simply 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: many*|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  @s game looks not worse, actually|pg||
nt|kemperg: same start in OR, but S rebid 2 @S , @D was not mentioned|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: here 2@s would be 6+@s, thats what N explained|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jfaria:  12 imps gain on B2, again as expected|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  and this line may well reduce declarer's tricks with 9 only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may clear @d now|pg||
nt|bg: this line guards against a heart switch but turns out ok since W has club ace|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  that's good bid opposite passed partner - when no game is in view|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bg: N should bid 4 clubs show that he has a few clubs he has already shown three hearts anywat they stopped in right spot|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this game seems better than 4@h |pg||
pc|c5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  2@s I mean|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  communication problems are closer|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  I'll never know, why one is sure about @cA in this postion|pg||
nt|kemperg: are they playing 2/1?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  next door, EW prevented opps from @h game|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  with the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Gustawsson was sold for 500|pg||

nt|kemperg: S had a pass on 2 @D so N knows they are high enough|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  and cash @d|pg||

nt|kemperg: @SK now?|pg||
nt|kemperg: entrys are a big problem here|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont see more then 8 tricks max.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  each line of play choosen by declarer, leads to one down, unfortunately |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if defence makes no mistake|pg||
nt|bg: this will tighten up the match|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bg: N could use 3 spades as minor suit interest but this pair may not have that in their system South would accept such a bid since a majority of his points are in the minors|pg||
