nt|peachy: Lively looking hand to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: friendly.|pg||

nt|panosk: hi Gary|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: This must be a very light 3rd seat 1@D by S?|pg||
nt|jcwla: If this auction is to make any sense?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or do we just have it all wrong?|pg||
nt|rv: South will double this, could be phantom save though|pg||
nt|andyv:  do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@Sis a two-suiter, known as Muiderberg in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|zhoufly: µÚ¶þÂÖ±ÈÈü¿ªÊ¼ÁË|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: Routine 4@S for NS.|pg||
nt|panosk: double is support i guess meaning 3hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with all bidding, a good stop, looks like just a make|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4333 in E not very appealing |pg||
nt|panosk: redouble probably honor in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes bet so panos|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi kibitzers and operator :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although a heart lead would have beaten it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: hi Raija welcome|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: West will not accept any invitation|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panosk: yes gd stop indeed|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|psyck:  generally as 5+ card @s any inv hand, some also play it as 4+card @s inv hand|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: not apleasant lead for south|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  hi Rashed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you all bid 5@C at love all?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: There are no words for my view on this 1@D opening.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Andy, no sleep:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: but 1 off|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Germ...how was breakfast?|pg||
nt|kemperg: fine ty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|psyck:  If W had a hand to accept inv, I assume E's plan was to say correct 3N to 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  Spec an listen to the voice commentary if using the browser version|pg||
nt|psyck:  *specs can...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this event is an 8 teams comptition after round 1 France with 25 vp is leading Sweden23 end netherlands 22  then come the 2 chinese teams england usa and canada|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rv: not me with especially with @SQJX|pg||
nt|twcho: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ssbux: it is also common in this part of the world, but usually 55|pg||
nt|jcwla: Something about rather trying to take 3 tricks than 11.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or even 4.|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes too much defensive value|pg||
nt|rv: I will take my medicine (even if fixed) and choose to quietly defend 4@s|pg||
nt|chnjcc:  åä½å¥½|pg||
nt|jcwla: This opening is so cheesy, really deserved a worse fate but the pressure bid pays off this time.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|panosk: re hi, slight connection error apparently|pg||
nt|rv: North might struggle to make even 9 tricks in @s strain|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: So joanna neve sit south and Danielle gaviard North|pg||
nt|peachy: heart lead is by NO MEANS obvious or even necessarily a good choice|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Fiona needs to drive out the A@C and get to dummy with a heart and lead up to the J@D|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|twcho: After 1st round, France is the leading team with 25 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: yes|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: standings can  be reached on bbo  programm of vu graph|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: N a passed hand so likely a pass by S and it is.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@C a phantom save against 3@S.|pg||

nt|ianmcc: hi Gary|pg||
pc|dT|nt|panosk: 2 Aces missing so 5 is enough|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulhac:  Even that is not necessary|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|peachy: Majority of Chinese players play Precision or similar strong club system|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||

nt|andyv:  for many years, 2/1 players played 3@h as 5-5 invite and 3@s as 5-5 GF.|pg||

nt|sybarra: do I have commentators available for this room?|pg||
nt|peachy: I would not be surprised if this were a push. Heart lead does not stand out in any way|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: Welcome back everybody. Here is the link to the tournament website with list of teams, running score/results and other info|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||
nt|sybarra: chinese commentary in closed room  english here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcwla: We have different definitions of "just barely there."|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even on a heart lead South has to win the first club and play another one|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E may just bid game here|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D seem plausible here|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: shaky hand   South have the points  East the distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and S will have hard time ignoring the 6 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h or 4@s will make|pg||
nt|twcho: I believe EW is playing 5 card M with 1C including all bal hand outside NT range|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Henry, alway happy to have you join us|pg||
nt|peachy: Even if W had much less than she does, it is valuable interference after they open 1D, to overcall 2C.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in 4@h, you don't have to worry as much about the Q@s.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=VeniceCup&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards%2F2011Veldhoven   for ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: convention cards|pg||
nt|rv: West will drive to game here, first bid 2@c as good raise in @h and then maybe bid and rebid @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/Netherlands/dekkers-michielson.pdf|pg||
nt|peachy: Many pairs, even experienced or experts, have trouble in the auction after that start|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although some may have doubled i prefer 2@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have bid 3@d as W, or started with double|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming 3@d means "bid 3N with a stopper, otherwise do something intelligent"|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: they played 4 @H's making in closed room |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
nt|jcwla: This pace is glacial.|pg||
nt|andyv:  watch out Jordan...they're moving faster and faster|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, but then come the undos -- no new bids, just an alert.|pg||
nt|rv: important system aspect for partnerships to discuss? 3@c could potentially show both majors with longer OM (@s here)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E trying to slow the train down|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think EW in CR are going to have a chat about this auction.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has a 3 loser hand...they should reach game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should 2@S not be forcing on the auction in the closed room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it is not, you have to bid 4@H over 1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Only on this planet, Roland, not on several others.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 2@C followed by something|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kemperg: wise to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...500-800 certainly possible in 5@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was -3 in the CR so still gains 3 imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd have a hard time bidding with the E hand on that aucition in the CR...only 100% force to cue bid and then bid @s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi all!|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi pano!|pg||
nt|loe48: Hi Dennis welcome :)|pg||
nt|panosk: even 7 @D is makeable as card lie but i doubt they will get there|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||
nt|andyv:  E here decides to show the @c stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W decides to dive off the deep end|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the best spot  is reached by West|pg||
nt|psyck:  With a hand unable to show @d's later, I'd prefer to open 1@d & rebid @c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: last set was 44-39 heaps of imps traded|pg||
nt|jcwla: To quote "Miracle Mile," What's the hurry, Harry?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will make with no problem losing 4 tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcwla: K&R has that last S hand at a generous 8.6: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ83+Q2+873+Q973 |pg||
nt|panosk: now secured , the friendly lie that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the difference between 6@H now and 6@H over1?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: will likely duck on sp  |pg||
nt|sybarra: *duck one |pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: I am not surprosed, it looked like a 7 count at first glance|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT seems like the field resting spot here.|pg||
nt|peachy: *surprised|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi aria|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she might as well have bid 6@H directly|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps less likely to make now?|pg||
nt|ssbux: why 3C, either 2c or 4c will be better and not misleading as notrump probe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  this looks more scientific, Roland...esp. when her partner showed her useful values in the @c suit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: hello patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Jean-Paul and Tommy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: a decent save non-vul here as 4@H easy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: I am guessing that W took 3NT to show the high end of a 1@H-response in values.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panosk: redouble showing 1st round control in @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: operator are rooms connecting |pg||
nt|twcho: hi Shirley and Raija|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: at these colours asking for too much. pass the right decision.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice auction|pg||
nt|kerasidis: very usufull....|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately game not reached CR|pg||
nt|panosk: gd lead to try to defeat, spade is no use since auction revealed singleton opposite A|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|panosk: even possible void (3@S)|pg||
nt|ssbux: Hi Patrick, will be seeing you playing next week|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|gracelin: oh  yes, in a similar event with Men's teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Tommy welcome |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes, bd 1 is a push, CR playing same boards as us|pg||

nt|ianmcc: hi rashed|pg||
nt|twcho: the Netherlands has gained 8 imps from 1st bd|pg||
nt|gracelin: The prize money in this Hua-Yuen Cup totalled US$200,000 which exceeds the Yeh"s Cup.|pg||
nt|sybarra: you may want to ask operator in chinese,  if rooms are connected |pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: N doubled 5@H so defence was easy in 6@S in closed room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes I think they are|pg||
nt|twcho: This tournament is the one that offers the highest prize money for Women bridge players ever|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A nice third-seat weak 2 if available.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a slam I'd rather be in|pg||
nt|sybarra: Star-studded international field. Click on  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: You are unlucky if you go down in 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you will with both finesses off|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  trick is for NS to stay low |pg||
nt|rv: red blooded pre-empt by Marion Michielsen|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: board one was plyed in1 NT doubled and made in CR|pg||
nt|gracelin: The 8 teams will share a pool of US$150,000 in the teams.  Another US$50,000 for the pairs.|pg||
nt|twcho: the prize money is enviable for men. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: The total prize money is US$200,000|pg||
nt|sybarra: teams from all over the world|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: On the cards and S's opening, 6@H is not an outre spot on 2, but the best-bid hand award awaits further nominations.|pg||
nt|rv: what is 4@d here by Smith, some play it as good raise in @Cs, a few others play it as both majors|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer to play 4@d as both majors 5-5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E has a solid road here, showing @S and forcing now, can show the @H later.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: if S bids his hearts.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: partial for N/S but they could get higher|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c bergen I think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: par contract in 5 in a minor for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, they have very generous sponsors in this Hua Yuen Women Elite Cup|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@D misguided in third seat.  It's their hand - put some pressure on.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now, let's talk about this double -- or the lack of a double by the N hand in similar situations.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats what i call trump support |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and does, finally a 10 point opener gets a good result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beegen raise I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bergen|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: and S decided he likes his hand a lot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C was bergen as I look at it and S upgraded his hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need this trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D Ace and @H back:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT is probably a sort of Lebensold to start a weak bid.|pg||
nt|twcho: with the winner taking 30,000|pg||
nt|twcho: and the last team will still have 12,000|pg||
nt|paulhac:  There are three events closely following each other this one, Beijing and Tianjin the later two being open|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Anybody have a problem with 3@D?|pg||
nt|rv: this slam is worse than 1 of 2 finesses, if @h finesse is off chances are not very bright|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ssbux: are they playing Lebansohl after a reversed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  the defense should be pretty easy as long as W doesn't get overly anxious and cashes out early|pg||
nt|ssbux: another unlucky slam for EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's all coming up orange so far.|pg||
nt|rv: still very decent slam just on @h finesse|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes very decent, but unlucky|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kiwibridge: looks like -1 again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep   could be -2 if they can get second ruff |pg||
nt|panosk: @D2 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd ruff = the same 2 trump tricks he started with?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 Nt is aking to go back to 3 @c in first stage|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and  last !!!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcwla: You and your favorite partner need to have agreement on what it means: does it ask for a @D lead (so that if you don't double you are suggesting a different lead) or does it say "I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: have a 2@D rebid that they stole"?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Plenty of room for both major K's to be in N, let alone just the @HK.|pg||
nt|twcho: is this common method played in France?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: if @h finesse is off, you need @s finesse on and black suit squeeze|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gracelin: north, with a little extra, may consider to take action other than 3C, but she has a boarderline hand. |pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: atleast 55% or so |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes   perhaps  South was not  very optimistec   it  not such a bad slam!!|pg||
nt|paulhac:  All are 8 team tournaments|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: I prefer the latter meaning and trust that pd will lead my suit in the absence of a clearly better alternative; however, I do have some pds who require the double if I want the ...|pg||

nt|peachy: Again, remembering Precision context|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|panosk: bad break in trumps 4@H had no chance gd game though|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D isnt simple support in @D must be 2way checkback with game forc hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  at 50 a pop, down 1 or 2 shouldn't make much difference as it's almost impossible to stop in 2@s or 2@h with the NS hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: probably another push |pg||
nt|ssbux: ten of D, signal for S?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|panosk: for more info check this link http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TwoWayCheckback.html|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @d would be easier|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: good unblock N after his good lead|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|twcho: Paul, I think you will be joining the Open events|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcwla: Right - here, it is clearly showing @D length.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|twcho: still they are NV so south no need to push so hard|pg||
nt|gracelin: south does have only one Q and 2 Jacks, but his minor suit fit plus a H shortage maybe enough to find a game invitation bid.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

mb|1C|nt|jcwla: And I agree with E's bidding up until the self-raise to 4.|pg||
nt|panosk: absolutely|pg||
nt|sybarra: S coming in?  and how best?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should die at 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Exactly|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this lies badly for N/S|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|panosk: this is the best way if you play it  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C must be conventional for majors?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nicola Smith and Sally Brock are very experienced, so they will get on with life and not let these results affect them|pg||
nt|rv: luck does even out in long tourney, British ladies should be resilient here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The first part score battle|pg||
nt|sybarra: you sort of want to open N hand dont you?|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: Precision NS then Raija?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  EW don't have enough to compete at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kerasidis: dont like emmediate 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: North's 1n shows 18-19 here|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally 9 tricks are available for N-S with lucky lie of red suits|pg||
nt|twcho: depends on the overall opening bid structure|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: The bridge Championship is being played at Shenzen, a beautiful city adjacent to Hongkong. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: catching up the scores now|pg||
nt|panosk: yes that was the threat but how can he know club honors not divided|pg||
nt|kerasidis: as it could be with weaker habnds|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hands|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 3@c maybe|pg||
nt|kemperg: did not know that, but @H had no use|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|kerasidis: there are partners with great aggrements with such hands...2@c or 3@c|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi carl|pg||
nt|ssbux: as I said previously, it is unusally to start with same boards when directed by Anthony|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If I was green I might be tempted|pg||
nt|sybarra: it just feels like a "good" hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  everyone wiling to play 1N except the author of the bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will be fortunate to go down 1|pg||
nt|ssbux: very lucky 3NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: n/S being talked out of good spot in @S's|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: confirmed by a spec, thx|pg||
nt|peachy: I really do not have any first hand knowledge, but looks like Precision|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C shows more high cards indeed so in case EW go to 5 level N doent have a clue about pards hand|pg||
nt|loe48: many use 2nt as good raise in this pos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Carl|pg||
nt|loe48: invite + in spade|pg||
nt|panosk: with the 4@S bid that is, agree with Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes many alternative bids...depends on partners aggrements|pg||
nt|kemperg: to much in @C nothing in red suits, 4@S good for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: N was a bit conservative for me shud have tried 2 spades|pg||
nt|rv: anyone open 2n (20-21) with North hand, what does K-R say?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Michielsen showing 18-19 balanced with her 1NT|pg||
nt|twcho: south is conservative not to overcall|pg||
nt|gracelin: the winner of the 8-team competiton will take home US$30,000 and the  8 also has US$12,000.  At moment, France is leading after one match and the Dutch is lying 3rd.|pg||
nt|twcho: probably deterred by the spot cards she held|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: @d most likely, will cost a trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Ns   remained silence with 25  hpc |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|rv: I suspect K-R will show more than 19 hcp for North hand, possibly not enough for 2n opening|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  A@h and @h|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20.45 per KR|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|peachy: This event does not have website or any other information online|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S made on 3 so an early 12 imps to HuaChu|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@s probably denies M|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ssbux: with a passed partner, no convenient bid|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh  hope we are not losing it again  |pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes Shirley|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|twcho: Paul, do you know about EW bidding system?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kiwibridge: however can't beat 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: one of those hands that cries out for a trump lead|pg||
nt|loe48: but..as crazy cards can be..opponents may have contract too..so 4s is also blocking alot same it can make|pg||
nt|twcho: and the double indicates @s suit|pg||
nt|peachy: The auction, to me, sounds like N did not believe South knew it was spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S= 1n?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I suppose Susan was afraid that if she bid 3@C she might push them into a makeable game|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl by S clearly penalty|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ssbux: dangerous with 1NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: I agree with south's pass over 1C, but may overcall 1H with the N hand.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: south is bit weak   to vercall 1 Nt and has 2 cards in @h not enogh to double she estimated|pg||
nt|gracelin: not for lead directing, of course, but allows partner to join the party with suitable hands.|pg||
nt|twcho: if the @c7 is replaced by @c10, I guess many will overcall 1NT then|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panosk: no |pg||
nt|panosk: with @D 2-2 and J10 @C dropping they can even make 3@C :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: the uppercut works !|pg||
nt|sybarra: miight get a trump now |pg||
nt|rv: will anyone in panel open 2n?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: I think 3@C is better as N will know S also have defensive values. I wud bid 4@S without @CKJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes indeed, Tommy.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on board 3 NL pir reached 3Nt which should nod be a success|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kerasidis: in one of them doubled could gain some imps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulhac:  If Norths X showed spades I wonder why she did not then bid 2@H if she was prepared to stand the X|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  making 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would only because I hate the rebids|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|twcho: some imps back to France then|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe it's good for NS to defend 2S rather than bidding their 25 points game which wouldn't make.|pg||
nt|peachy: Exactly|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: yes and @S would restrict S to +!.|pg||

nt|sybarra: bet we see a "utililty" 1 @D here |pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: 10 well-deserved IMPs to ZhuJiang there for getting to and making the @H game.|pg||
nt|sybarra: all 3 level contracts in last hand -1 |pg||
nt|andyv:  part score battle|pg||
nt|sharkey: cant be if S bids 4@S directly|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  1 nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NT range possibly 14-16, but we have no evidence other than bidding and the fat they play Precision :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's fine otherwise. I have a @D suit that is well worth mentioning (playing in, leading) and I don't expect the counterpart to bid 2NT, so I would open 1@D.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but most like a push board even after opening 2NT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@s  two suiter|pg||
nt|gracelin: West cannot afford to see which minor partner has.|pg||
nt|psyck:  5@s, 4+minor, 8-10hcp usually|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: west shoud pass   with obvious misfit|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sybarra: 3 @S's as well |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: appears we have now lost score comparisons which makes life harder|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@C  majors|pg||

mb|2S|nt|rv: 2@d by East could show no preference to majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d here...pick your major|pg||
nt|twcho: we have to guess the meaning of the bids then. :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: at last a swing on 3 NS pushed to 5 level by W's 5@D bid then X'd|pg||
nt|panosk: had to cash A@S first to defeat 3@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D forcing Stayman?|pg||
nt|sharkey: gf|pg||
nt|kerasidis: can anyone inform us pls|pg||
nt|kerasidis: from the kibbs |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|peachy: This is an invitational event, 8 sponsors with their teams|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: for the French pair  i have  an idea :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panosk: for me 4@S can be 6small spades and some single, but is a matter of approach |pg||
nt|rv: 2@d shows equal length (2-2 or 3-3) in majors usually|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I was kind enough not to say anything about hte 1NT last hand, but the words are just bubbling on my tongue|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is just cruising for a bruising here.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H=4 card support good hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  no battle at all as S decided to open a light NT|pg||
nt|loe48: true|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume 1 NT =13-15 or 12-14|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a nice advantage of a system that leaves that step in between.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is exactly why you need 2@C for the majors, and not 2@D or 2@H as in Capp and DONT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: standard lead onthis bidding should be trump with strong opposition in minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: now he has to make 6 |pg||
nt|ianmcc: could be up for another -100|pg||
nt|loe48: 13-15|pg||

pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: I was sent a story yestaerday on Barry cranes rules for finding the missing Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: with nothing to go on |pg||
nt|sharkey: West made slam try in @D but E turned it down.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: do tell Gary |pg||
nt|rv: low @h best now|pg||
nt|rv: still likely to be trick short|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@D not unreasonable with decent trump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see declarer coming to 8 tricks with proper defense.  With club forcing fummy to ruff, defense will be ahead.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: sure Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: either club or trump return will be fine.|pg||
nt|twcho: and good shift to @d by north|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, thougful defense before declarer's diamond losers pitched on the good H.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: and it worked here|pg||
nt|panosk: ah yes and only played with people who aplied his rule too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: apparently his partners were forced to follow his rule|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: he certainly played enough hands to verify a theory |pg||
nt|rv: pitch a @c now and another on @HK, can he make it now?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|gracelin: a trump return now will also see declarer one trick short|pg||
nt|gracelin: or CA, of course.|pg||
nt|sybarra: how many bds in match?   I forgot to look |pg||

nt|Walddk2: What is the chance of a 4333 all round?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10.9 per KR on the S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer asking if there is time limit for bid and play. The Conditions of Contest say 2H 15 min is allotted for the whole match.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they are also fairly strict to that,  but Tommy or Paul could tell us|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|kemperg: dbl on that:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont doubt it |pg||
nt|peachy: East will likely balance with a Dbl, at least he should or else neg dbl would be a worthless convention for them|pg||
nt|peachy: West at the crossroads, what to do|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, in an ugly spot|pg||
nt|peachy: he cant leave it in|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S the least of evils|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which pill would you swallow, pass or 2@S?|pg||
nt|peachy: bitter pill, but 2S for me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: me too|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i can not imagine 2 pairs playing same contract here...so a swing will come|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can win the battle by playing 2NT|pg||

nt|panosk: ok but 4@C doesnt preclude 4@S :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree.  though they might also make 3H with D 3-3.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||

nt|twcho: not easy for west to find the @d continuation|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: N achieved the desired result with that x. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W is flat and minumum so should decline the invite|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: in that case she needs to take their HA before the 4th D.|pg||

nt|twcho: unless east find the K discard|pg||
nt|twcho: @hK|pg||
nt|gracelin: East should know west has two Hearts by passing 2H, so maybe he could pitch HK to deny HA.  If West has it, West will cash it anyway.|pg||
nt|twcho: then it will be a masterpiece|pg||
nt|ssbux: difficult to discard HK, what if declarer hold AQ in heart and Ax in C|pg||
nt|twcho: and one of the best defended hand then|pg||
nt|gracelin: SS, then partner won't pass 2H with a singleton.|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|jcwla: Yes, far more worthy of a bid than the 1@D S egested on 1.|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl could be showing majors, a common def to strong C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same story can be repeated in CR:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect the CR auction to be widely duplicated.|pg||
nt|sybarra: little imps may count  but you probably dont worry about them this early |pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16 again|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|kiwibridge: 7 imps quite a cruel penalty really|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2@c bid was reasonable on previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thought it should be only -1|pg||

nt|gracelin: bue even West did find the 4th round D play, declarer may still guess it right since SA is sure with East after west has shown an AKQxx suit in D.  also a likely honor in H.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like a club system in action |pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe over 2NT an accepting 3@H and then back to 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Surely N is minimum for the original X?  Oh well, S would have done anyway and maybe should have to begin with.|pg||
nt|sybarra: on this bd|pg||

pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Prec|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't understand these methods :)|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: makes even on the improbable @d lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see N leading a @D nor doest it really mater |pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: without any significant spot cards, west wisely chose 4@s to be the final contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: best contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we warn them about 6 @D|pg||
nt|panosk: 6nt looks gd as cards lie|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 2@D I'm told is GF stayman, why he'd do it with only one major I don't know|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|sybarra: gm Henry :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  gm Shirley @h|pg||
nt|panosk: hi henry|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 0745 for us here, hence the gm |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or the @D do not behave H|pg||
nt|henryb:  you have 4@d tricks on any break: look at the spots|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm watching live cricket from England I bet Roalnd is too|pg||
nt|panosk: the real question here is shud he accept?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland it probably at the match  |pg||
nt|henryb:  England - India?|pg||

nt|sybarra: are we in deep thought? or losing conex?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think thought |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D for me, welcome Rashed :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Playing 2/1, I think 2D is automatic|pg||
nt|rv: best lead, now if North can win and switch to @h, I suspect Smith will cash 3@hs and switch to @s|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|peachy: We dont have access to the player's system details|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: the more the merrier it is for me, one is quite lonely|pg||
nt|andyv:  since EW can make game, was E's 3@h bid conservative?|pg||
nt|kemperg: doubt, but we would end in 2|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wouldt either|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H makes whereas @S does not.|pg||
nt|sybarra: scary shift for declarer maybe|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooer|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is the word oof|pg||
nt|panosk: that was a danger after 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N should possibly be converting|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see he should but at the table not sure you know to do that |pg||
pc|d4|nt|panosk: bad lead for decl cant see bare K@H |pg||
nt|peachy: I think four is the perfect number, three is great too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|blewah: W bids reds and NT, E blacks only|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely end up playing 6NT or @D, as per their system.|pg||
nt|blewah: sure they are on the same wave |pg||
nt|ssbux: famous dish in Beijing, the Peking duck|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: high quality bridge as mentioned by Roland right at the start of this broadcast|pg||

nt|blewah: i was wrong, ok.|pg||
nt|peachy: G'night all, enjoy the match!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesn't look like it thought E was heading for 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Bye Raija, nice sleep.|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW plays 2/1 I think - East showed limit raise with 3 trumps so they stopped in 3@S|pg||
nt|loe48: its not an opener 1,2 seat imo|pg||
nt|kerasidis: aceless with no alternative bid|pg||
nt|loe48: 3rd seat 1s okay|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: can he do 6 @d only loding 1 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be able to make it as E also has 4@C|pg||
nt|twcho: though even 3NT is cold with even break in minors|pg||
nt|twcho: but 4@s rates to be a superior contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer wisely won the first club trick, or a D shift might be damaging.|pg||
nt|gracelin: though with HA in south and, even an opening D lead will not hurt the contract.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ok 10 easy tricks  |pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks to the H10.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some player play a response of 3@D to show 4-4-1-4 or 4-3-1-5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kemperg: N has enough to try make life diff. for strong @C|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes agree|pg||
nt|rv: now another @c, if finessed by Smith, North can win and back a @h, still declarer can get home for 9 tricks with @s breaking|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to say I prefer even the @C5 to the 7 for the opening salvo.|pg||
nt|rv: yes I like second best leads from poor suit, many experts even prefer attitude leads against nt|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Here you can put on your best air of faux innocence but it's kind of a readout.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|panosk: its not i agree , but im not always rational on table :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: dag i have seen you open weaker hands in 3 seat :)|pg||
nt|loe48: 7 hps :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think most players wud open - but Pass will get many votes too|pg||
nt|panosk: 3rd seat is quite different|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S 2@C gf or inv+ with 3@Ss, 2@D, less then 16 pts, 2@S inv with 3crd. end|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kemperg: no option for N i think|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: against nt, many folks don't show count by leading 4th best or 3/5, leads are attitude showing interest (low card lead) or disinterest (high card lead) in continuing suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

nt|sybarra: not to stay out of slam |pg||

nt|rnmalik: I agree, no harm to pass 1@H and wait for P's response who is not a passed hand.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  still, need to guess @s Q and need K@d on side...so not a great slam|pg||
nt|rv: 2n seems to be jacoby showing 4+@s, 12+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: no no cant be S bidding 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: undo operator |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: E in good position to check on keycards |pg||

mb|d|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed, 3NT .|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2N guarantees 4@s...many play garbage stayman and would have to bid 2@s with S hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|panosk: E doesnt know which major but he correctly thinks its spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are various methods, my multi 2@D = weak 2 either major OR 20-22 with a 5 card suit OR and 8+ playing tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a lot of folks include a strong bid in multi  |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not as a rule with most pard's I play with on bbo |pg||
nt|andyv:  but momentum may put them there|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: or 2 strong as in NZ version|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may try 5@d now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 @h should  show 5 5    usually|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: without fit with partner, east stayed low by bidding 2N instead of 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|twcho: and with much better than minimum hand, west happily accepts the invitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2 finesses.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes maybe it was |pg||
pc|cA|nt|kemperg: no, with garbage you have both majors and pass 2@H|pg||
nt|panosk: yes there are various version , also 1 with strong 3 suiter|pg||

pc|c4|nt|kemperg: next|pg||
nt|sybarra: in general,  multi is not/can not be played in usa|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  W must have realized the 4@c bid was already an overbid and did well to stop in 4|pg||
nt|blewah: agree, 4@c was an upgrade|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: I see 11 tricks, 12 made in CR|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: funny USA, trying to protect the innocent, actually it's easy enough to defend|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: with  9 minors cards known in West hand , East judged that she does not care to propose her second major suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: next week in Tienjin China will see another Men's Elite team invitational with high cash prize.  USA, Italy/England, Netherland, Sweden, Norway , 2 teams from China and the Asia ...|pg||
nt|gracelin: Stars will compete in this event.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rv: we need help from operator or spectators to decipher subsequent auction post 2n|pg||
nt|twcho: a very sensible auction|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: that was fairly fearless|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  right...if they had garbage hand...but since 2N over 2@h would deny a 4 card major, they would have to bid 2@s with the invite hand and 4 spades.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzmc: 2NT show 4 support|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Gary,  and many have heard me say I played in Neth.  and evey jr, youth and granny had a defense to multi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On the bidding CR had better chance of playing 6@D.|pg||
nt|rv: conventional (read traditional) response to jacoby 2n is 3 level bids show stiff, 3M denies stiff with extra length, 3n shows extras hcp possibly 15-17 (maybe 5422), 4 level bids ...|pg||
nt|rv: shows second 5 card suit, 4M shows sub-min/min opening with no redeeming feature|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to beg off here, thanks all, enjoy the rest.|pg||
nt|rv: there are plenty of variations to traditional jacoby and conventional jacoby is hardly played by most of the experts nowadays|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  Not true, Shirley. Multi can be used in any team game of 6+ boards where the players are "Flight A"|pg||
nt|panosk: yes if you dont know what to bid wait till they say their suit and then take action like double |pg||
pc|s6|pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: our Juniors love to play and defend it|pg||

nt|rnmalik: now this is a slam and probably a flat board too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS should have no trouble getting to 6...question is if they have the tools to get to 7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: too many tricks.|pg||
nt|rv: well bid nonetheless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: the one i like and its completely banned is 2@H weak in unknown major|pg||
nt|gracelin: But every match has a match prize.  Winner take US$1,500 and loser $500.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  That should bring England back into the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: thats really dangerous|pg||
nt|rv: last part of last auction can be explained 4NT = RKCB 5@D = 1 key cd 5@H = asking 2nd rd control 6@C = yes + 3rd rd control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D = 1 major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Multi defence to 1NT|pg||
nt|rv: sry 5@h is @sQ ask, 6@c shows @SQ and @CK|pg||
nt|twcho: I suspect that it is because of the strength of Chinese Women Team.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: these are 16 boards per match  a full round robin of 8 teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: N might have perfernced @d? |pg||
nt|peachy: Closed room is either very slow, or else, tables not connected|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rv: back to this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: nice pANOS|pg||
nt|sharkey: You open N hand 1@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brock must be happy to learn that partner has a major|pg||
nt|ssbux: The Asia Stars shall comprise of the veteran pairs Lasut and Manoppo from Indonsia, Patrick Huang and his partner from Chinese Taipei and Samuel Wan and Dereck Zen from Hong Kong|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: Panos sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a dangerous 5@D bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @C holding in N hand and @h holding in S hand will be hard to describe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least her majors are equally good|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: nice bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H now competitive or inviting?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Precision 2@C here, 6+ in the absence of a major, now 7+  NS will shortly be in game.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S is good raise of @D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since about 60% of our tables are now in team events, either 2-day KOs or Swiss, its not true that it is even close to barred|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: thats tempting :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i would|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or is it bad|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I don't like vul 2 level O/C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you take the money as South or just bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|rv: sitting here I will surely take money|pg||
nt|rv: at the table, I will contemplate a bit more and still take the money|pg||
nt|rv: on accurate defense it could go for 800?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price right for a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all Thx Roland|pg||
nt|rv: Hi P.Sridhar, gm|pg||
nt|ssbux: welcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  gm P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am in full agreement with RV there- odds do not favour that 2@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: GM Andy/RV :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: high level competitors have tools these days to reach their contracts even after 2@d/2@s, so some usefulness of intervention is already lost|pg||
nt|psridhar: and the risk of going for 500/800 exixts still|pg||
nt|psridhar: exists|pg||
nt|rv: 800 is not possible for N-S, on perfect defense declarer could still get out for -500, not very costly|pg||
nt|ssbux: Sorry, I mean veteran pair|pg||
nt|sybarra: could be either |pg||
mb|2D|nt|kemperg: dbl should be inviting for me|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Too good for 2@H?|pg||
nt|loe48: to strong for 2h non vul|pg||
nt|twcho: who will be your partner, Patrick?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Logically, it should be that for others, too|pg||
nt|loe48: if vul 2h okay|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, weak 2 is 4-8 with green against red|pg||
nt|rv: Brock must have heaved sigh of relief|pg||
nt|psridhar: meanwhile appreciate how much better the E hand is if one of those minor honors she has -is in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least this can't be misinterpreted as a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: pref both:)|pg||
nt|rv: yes I would O/C with KQJ9XX, AX, XXX, XX even at these colors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Marion may think that this is a slam invite since Dekkers did not bid 4@H the round before|pg||
nt|psridhar: and that hand also is 10 HCP :)|pg||
nt|rv: and still may not with just J or Q in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand her way of thinking|pg||
nt|rv: 5 level is safe, no harm even if Marion bids 4@s|pg||
nt|ssbux: Herstein?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|panosk: weak 2 is out of the question in any vul for me|pg||
nt|loe48: vul vs non vul i open 2h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: just a max in other circumstances for me|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers will sign-off in 5@h quickly|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brock's pass of X must show @d , 2@d X is possibly a good spot for EW ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not bid 4@H before? Double + 4@H slam invitational she must be thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: Herstein Liu, used to be my teammate but in this tournament I will partner with him.|pg||
nt|twcho: good luck Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: tks, ust try not to disgrace ourself.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: agree with you on the last hand, 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  W better lead a trump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can borrow one from E.:)|pg||
nt|panosk: if you need to open 1 is much beter |pg||
nt|gracelin: It's nice to see a natural 2D over the 1NT rebid.  Many play this as a GF check-back.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  anyone like N's 4@s bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still time for brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps S should keycard and then sign off in 5@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: Roland's point is very valid -but before that we should know whats X of 2@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding 5@h directly might give N some encouragement to bid on|pg||
nt|rv: Marion Michielsen has an excellent hand opposite unilateral jump to 4@h, a) no wastage in @h, b)4 trumps and c) all those controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double of 2@D would usually be "I want to double at least one major"|pg||
nt|psridhar: if it was a value showing X , N is justified in slam try; if it was a take out X, i think she has less cause|pg||
nt|psridhar: oh penalty X ?|pg||
nt|rv: I would treat North's hand as super-max for the auction so far|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: N agrees|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would not be my choice with 4-card @H's but they're obv on the same wavelength.|pg||
nt|peachy: North is delighted to go, five good trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the match is very tight   now 2 imps difference|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: and what % are Flight A ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he can't have liked his 2@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 2 aces S must bid 5NT. GS.|pg||
nt|gracelin: then they also use 2C to force a 2D rebid to stop in 2D.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: I suspect that not many in North America and Europe have heard about the city Shenzhen in the Guangdong province, the venue for this tournament. Shenzhen has more than 10 million ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: inhabitants!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: French pair Ns  uses only 2 @c as a check back stayman|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C lead would be interesting.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if K@c is lead, E needs to rise with A and return @d|pg||
nt|psridhar: N has a difficult task -if she is required to guess that her partner made a "penalty oreineted X" and changed her mind later|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|andyv:  now, no worries for 5@d:)|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure if N-S playing any last train cue bids, if they play Dekkers could have bid 5@d with any sort of interest and her 5@h would state I have no interest|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h = long @H, with that suit, she couldnt possibly have expected to defend 2@H X|pg||
nt|psridhar: good, thoughtful lead -will set 5N here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one probably won't make the textbooks|pg||
nt|blewah: and 5 card support|pg||
nt|rv: yes great lead|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|jaapfr: what a horror double|pg||
nt|blewah: E "knew" S has his own suit|pg||
nt|twcho: a very comfortable contract for NS|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rnmalik: why x in S where opps are being vul are in a losing contract.|pg||
nt|twcho: CR NS bid to 3NT and make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is  Star-studded international field. Click on  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||
nt|sybarra: see http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TableResult.aspx?tourid=1174&section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=3&stanza=0&tableNO=1|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told the E player is young Aussie player,   Her mother Janet Brown is a well known player from the eastern coast of NSW (she plays in a seaside town called Ballina).|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True she nows lives in harrogate England and is the partner of the Irish international Hugh McGann|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|peachy: Thank you Roland, your suspicion is spot on, I'm sure|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, he can afford to misguess everything.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kerasidis: this b would be very interesting in pair contest|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ssbux: ok, which room, Open?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lebridgeur: West suprisingly did not continue @h losing a trick|pg||
nt|twcho: Even 4@h is not without chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe she feared partner would be ruffing with Qxx or A10x for a natural trump trick.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rv: North should duck this to restrict damage|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  down 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may have been a battle between 500 and 550|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: 6N was indeed found CR for another 2 imps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  In Swiss, about a third; in KOs about a quarter; but anyone is allowed to play Flight A in a Swiss|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bill tells me CR in 6@C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: vul against non -vul.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so EW probably saved a couple of imps by pulling 5@dx|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|lebridgeur: 4 @h   is very optimistc contract !|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|twcho: certainly. :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  E/W are a young pair (both under 30) who have established themselves in the England team|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: you see luck has already evened out, E-W bid a good slam on deal 3 which went down, here 2@d O/C has caused problem to opps who have overreached|pg||
pc|c3|nt|blewah: from +400 to -130|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h9|nt|jcwla: N is known to have real @H's here - there was a hand in the 2010 Rosenblum final (written up by Howard Weinstein in the August Bridge World) where a 2@D preempt was doubled on a ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: big 4-4-3-2 and the 2@H raise advanced to four, which bombed when pd was 3-3-4-3. |pg||
nt|gracelin: south is a little conservative in rebidding 2D only.  Some might try an invitational 3D.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gracelin: but even after that  can't see NS reaching 4H.|pg||

nt|ianmcc: N/S probably unhappy but N/S closed not laughing either|pg||
nt|panosk: -1 shud be gd result for NS|pg||
nt|loe48: yes -1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|panosk: EW can make 4@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: The opening hands on Bd 9 and Bd 7 are rated equal according hand evaluator - 11 HCP http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQx+AKJx+AK98+Kx|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS likely to get to 3 NT here|pg||
nt|ssbux: as stated previous by Roland, the English pair is not affected the unlucky bd 2 and 3.  They are now coming back|pg||
nt|psridhar: slam on then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All the top teams next month in the Venice Cup in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand should be fun |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: 15 opposite 9 |pg||
nt|kerasidis: 1nt open by W here?|pg||
nt|rv: with that hand with South, even GS on rite?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: 10 with W having all the rest|pg||
mb|2S|nt|panosk: 10 actually and yes why didnt he tried at least ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 10, with all suits behaving nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: right 10 |pg||
nt|psridhar: yes-so slam on with less one card less|pg||
nt|rv: even if South had one of the minor honor cards missing in PS's example hand, LS would be cold|pg||
nt|gracelin: Now a not so routine 3NT for NS.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|twcho: and 4@h will go down if defense find the @d switch in time|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 @h by North|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: showing good @d   and propose for NT contract|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: more Precise here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: or EW may be in trouble...|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess it's a fit showing jump showing invitation strength.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  usually done with 5 card @c though|pg||
nt|paulhac:  So with board 3 to score England take the lead for the first time|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: its not just the actual pts count he also had gd spots|pg||
nt|henryb:  Slam on a hook that loses|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@H down on the losing finesse|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: What's good for the goose is good for the gander here with the ace underleads to NT dummy.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: S doesnt know N has values - unless he x|pg||
nt|panosk: he will soon :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  but this hand seems to be a good time to uise it with 4 esp woth those @d's|pg||
nt|twcho: with all those spot cards, 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3@c  shows @d and @c|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kiwibridge: 6@C was -3 to make the carnage worth 15|pg||
nt|blewah: did it really make?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange and defence to other contracts after preempt by P.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure Jean-Paul is right.  3C showed a 3NT invitational hand with D fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer might return a H after winning HK.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W keeps them out by bidding probably|pg||
nt|psridhar: but NS need to sort out if Dekkers wd bid that way holding such pattrens|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rv: only point for consideration, would South have bid 5@d as last train cue bid with such hands?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kerasidis: weird in my opinion....N doesnt know south's 18 points hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Score another one for weak NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: to make sure she establish a 2nd H trick.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: no  3@c   shows limit fit in @d  with @c suit usually 5 4 the other way|pg||
nt|twcho: so another sensible auction leading to a cold contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: OK, Jeam-Paul must be right about the French girls bidding :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|loe48: south shall x again|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could be 300|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 was not that difficult to bid on last hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats another crucial point rv|pg||
nt|peachy: Board 3 is already included in the 21 England has, it was a 1IMP for making 7, French pair made 6 |pg||
nt|sybarra: did E have a better play,  like J of hts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does she get the @D switch?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  benedct Cronier passed the hand Fiona Brown opened 1@H|pg||
nt|peachy: or is it?.  The website running score shows 16-20|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does she need the @D ruff?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panosk: i'm a huge meckwell proponent as far as slam bidding is concerned need more than 50% chance to bid it |pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: and - If N and W hands are reversed....|pg||
nt|loe48: if north bid 2h then bid 2s|pg||
nt|panosk: he wudnt run W|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: thanks Patrick :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Heart return is a sure play while to establish a club trick is not.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  but they needed to have the right asking bids|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s5|pc|h7|nt|kemperg: nice defense|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he could claim only if he knew that there was an auto black squeeze on S @SK @CJ|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that's what S said to N|pg||
nt|sharkey: What was 2@D?|pg||
nt|gracelin: not like in Yeh's Cup the winner almost takes all the prize home.  Here the prize money is much more evenly distributed from $30,000 to 25,000, to 20,000 and up to $12,000 for the ...|pg||
nt|gracelin: bottom team.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  No Hurry there was always a natural diamond trick|pg||

nt|blewah: but N can hold @sJ|pg||
nt|rv: easy deal for Dutch ladies here, always help after disaster|pg||

nt|kemperg: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Andy :)|pg||

nt|blewah: so he was sure @sK would be left bare by S?|pg||

nt|gracelin: The 2 Chinese ladies team met in the 1st match and saw a low scoring 16:14 VP split.  All other 3 matches were one-sided.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: As the linesmen used to say when we came on court at 6-5 in the third set, "We only come in to close."|pg||

nt|panosk: i think they dont like slams as much as they do games hence they become more conservative not that they cant |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourIndex.aspx?tourid=1174  for the tournament website in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer must lose a 2nd club trick so in fact will need HA to be on side, or a good guess if North leads one at some stage.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kemperg: seems 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One, the Multi defense|pg||
nt|twcho: Patrick, you have a tight schedule. Playing in Beijing from Wednesday and then go to Tianjin next week|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, just anoter bridge week.|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Martin welcome |pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: too weak.|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes on a @h lead|pg||
nt|rv: they will get to another slam here after this start to auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: E wont give up|pg||
nt|psridhar: i suspect this is going all the wway to slam|pg||
nt|rv: in my view, I will pass 2@s with West hand, will panel O/C 3@D, I presume not many will consider 2n|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Apologies for mentioning Germany before. They are not taking part, Canada is|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  I'd bid it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had a leap to 2 nt over a minor,  never sure waht it means |pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think 6@h is too hard|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I abhor that fatuous 2NT resposne to the nebulous 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: i "hate" is what is should say |pg||
nt|panosk: more or less same as what 1nt does :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: abhor = fancy word for hate :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: true but should not be bid.|pg||
nt|blewah: Precision EW|pg||
nt|rv: Nicola Smith has taken Sally Brock's 2n very seriously|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psridhar: there was no clue for her to not take it seriously :)|pg||
nt|rv: yes:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  N can force an entry to get this down 1|pg||

nt|pfbr: morning Roland@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GM dear A @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  S would need to be clairvoyant and not lead a @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: knowing pard will open any pathetic 11 count should be good reason for not lurching to 2NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: tie for club nw|pg||
nt|gracelin: now|pg||
nt|gracelin: time|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: forgive my absence as I am cooking in order to be around for the last set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H/@S on @S finesse.|pg||

nt|blewah: @cQ. sry|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has 3 losers but 4@S had 4 tough hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  5@h asks for quality of @h suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kerasidis: about the previous....does north know that his partner has 18 points?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ianmcc: North has to lead Black?|pg||
nt|blewah: can make with the trump lay out|pg||
nt|andyv:  are there enough tricks on @h lead?|pg||
nt|blewah: needs to run @h from dummy twice|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may have draw too many trumps and doesn't have enough entry fr both setting up club and lead toward dummy's HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but south helped her for the H issue.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: but south hs done part of the job|pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer is home|pg||
nt|ssbux: sorry, have to go,emergency call from boss. bye|pg||
nt|gracelin: bye SS|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|blewah: need to ruf 1 @d only i think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to play.|pg||
nt|andyv:  harder than it looks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W tries to pitch on K@c, the contract should fail|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  nice play by N|pg||
nt|gracelin: south is trying to reach north for a club ruff, but that will be only defender's 3rd trick, andlast.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: testing, anyway|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|kemperg: perfect|pg||
nt|jcwla: E needed to take out the scissors.|pg||
nt|andyv:  very true|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to see the danger but probably a no cost play to lead a @s on trick 2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Play a @S right back before the @D ruffing pos'n established - |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the multi in CR bought 2NT which was -3|pg||
nt|blewah: ruff @d now and play another @h|pg||
nt|kerasidis: and if he does why not bidding 2 nt over 2spades?|pg||
nt|loe48: no|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rv: no entry to dummy, otherwise double finesse in @hs and hoping for 3-2 break was best chance|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: good play.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  this time the conservatives win..E was most uncooperative!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant blame E|pg||
nt|jcwla: Best play we'll see in this segment I would think, well done by N.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|twcho: yes, better to return a @d and let declarer fighting for her 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: if stockdale ditches spade queen can hold to 1 but she missed it|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: justice here|pg||
nt|panosk: yes that was a lucky break|pg||
nt|andyv:  a @s lead would have tested W as both of his entries to dummy can be knocked out quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: thats why i mean he need to x again, to show big opener|pg||
nt|rv: in my view, E-W are over aggressive in their bidding based on deals in this session|pg||

nt|sybarra: bd 9 where we made 3nt (in1)  they were in 3 at the other table going down |pg||

nt|twcho: will you overcall with east hand?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  but impressive:)|pg||

nt|andyv:  wonder if 3N shows longer @cs|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl and then??|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 9, 5@D x -1 in CR.|pg||
nt|andyv:  best for N to pass|pg||
nt|panosk: i quite like 1nt here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: t|pg||
nt|loe48: 13-15. and x on same values..|pg||
nt|kerasidis: so would you stay in nt doubled with 6 points?|pg||
nt|loe48: so 15+|pg||
nt|panosk: for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: more informative than mere 2@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: splinter raise perfect for N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Gary and everyone.|pg||
nt|panosk: we have the lead too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be N shud bid 2 NT over 2@s?|pg||
nt|loe48: i sit on nt x with 6 100 of 100 times|pg||
nt|gracelin: and not as much :(|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other room the opening was 1C, E was rendered mute|pg||
nt|sybarra: that made a difference maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: he knows the Shenzen tong|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not totally without risk?  Or did the XX promise a 3-bagger?|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever it shows, E can't sit for it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the typo, should have been  ½   about mid way through the sentence|pg||
nt|peachy: Nice pull, as it turns out|pg||
nt|kemperg: N will, but E|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes you get to play it here |pg||
nt|gracelin: the bottom team will only get US$2,000 instead of US$12,000 here.|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, thanks Patrick, voice commentators were discussing it & i was replying to to them based on what you said|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if artificial maybe you should come in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @C was probably "could be 2"|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: cant be all bad|pg||
nt|rv: East's hand just about minimum for t/o with this shape (4333) or would panel require a bit more?|pg||
nt|gracelin: not sure what the double means exactly.  Maybe just sort of bid something double.|pg||
nt|sybarra: instead of better minor |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@h is truly a dreamer's bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Rashed good to have your company @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  you dream that S will have the right dummy for you|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could have perhaps balanced with 3c at the end |pg||
nt|peachy: The bidding diagram shows no alert, that does not mean a whole lot, unless they play 5542|pg||
nt|twcho: I will overcall 2@c and never consider 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: and if pard stronger i dont mind playing higher than 1|pg||
nt|blewah: and he proved he was right by misguessing the Q trump :)|pg||
nt|rv: no @c wastage and approx 14 hcp is my requirement with 4M333 shape for t/o double of minor opening|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you tommy |pg||
nt|sybarra: but maybe 2 @C meant something different |pg||
nt|sybarra: like michaels|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would probably balance|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are white!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C is fine by me, little danger of missing game opposite passed hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: I'm not privvy to their agreements nor that steady on Precision, what might 4NT mean I wonder|pg||
nt|sybarra: that puts it to declarer |pg||
nt|panosk: yes shud be torchoured a bit for his bid :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: how ever you spell tortured,  that is being done|pg||
nt|panosk: i meant tortured of course|pg||
nt|panosk: E carefully took with A@H so no clues|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N of course should pull to 2@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think with so many english words it is difficult for europeans |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: CR in 5@S X I'm told so another swing coming|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid but makes 6@H as the cards are placed.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have words that sound the same and spelled differently |pg||
nt|gracelin: East was hoping West can bid NT with Kx of spade, but she dorgot partner doesn't has any H stopper to bid NT.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psridhar: factor the passed hand pd in rv :)|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D is GF checkback, 2@s showed 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers can play this deal easily, she knows location of all honor cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer needs to play @s twice and @h once - 3 entries to dummy needs and she has 3 alright|pg||
nt|rv: she is thinking of catering to 4-1 @s break with @SAQ8X with East|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: E did not go for the possible penalty pass in W, |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not a peep from EW to worry them either|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c forced 2@d I think|pg||
nt|blewah: XYZ convention or some sort|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree with 2nd double from South then N shud act|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud have ducked @D lead|pg||
nt|loe48: i mean, how much do they need to sit on it..not much hps left out now besides what he had|pg||
nt|gracelin: so eventually she bid NT herself and was raised to game.|pg||
nt|psyck:  should W have tried 3@s on 1@s then?|pg||
nt|psyck:  E|pg||
nt|twcho: with most favorable lie of @d, 3NT will roll in|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  this should go down 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  float the 10|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kemperg: No opening in W so perhaps good decision|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of bidding being done |pg||
nt|andyv:  looking at all 4 hands, EW are hard pressed to bid and make anything|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Have to go thanks all Patrick Tommy Krishna and specs|pg||
nt|twcho: bye Jean-Paul|pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks Jean-Paul, you are most helpfl|pg||
nt|psyck:  thx Jean-Paul|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Martin  another good reason|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: now EW make 2NT on defence|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rv: only 10 tricks because of @c blockage?|pg||
nt|rv: East win second @s and play back second @d|pg||
nt|psridhar: rt|pg||
nt|psridhar: East shd hv won the first @s itself|pg||
nt|psridhar: but 4@S will make always|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  no useful pitch coming on J@c|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kerasidis: opps play weak nt so double can be weaker...that was my point|pg||
nt|loe48: 15+|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  somewhere the wheels came off or maybe W just decided to chance it|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcwla: Cannot blame E for this one I wouldn't think.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: almost|pg||
nt|panosk: or i shud have studied harder when my parents paid for my english classes :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: NAH,  you had a good time!|pg||
nt|panosk: long way from it yes :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|loe48: so u sit on 21+|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rv: is this risky line if @cs are 5-2?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: the defence slip from grace|pg||
nt|panosk: as a fellow viewer pointed out E cant have all high cards in clubs since he didnt played it, so must have AK@H that was a clue|pg||
nt|panosk: gd point|pg||
pc|c3|nt|loe48: and strong hand behind opener|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gracelin: don't see the hurry to take DA by north, her only entry for the spade.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kerasidis: :) ok lets leave that i am sure that we could speak till tomorrow for that....more or less it was good for alayzing|pg||
nt|rv: I much prefer second @s by declarer|pg||
nt|twcho: so again east find the not so promising @s switch and let the contract make|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||

nt|sybarra: in closed room  E did not overcall|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kiwibridge: can EW reach 6@H after N opens|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: not when 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yes, hand is a point shy but LOOKS like a 1NT opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S raising  (I would) |pg||
nt|blewah: pass?|pg||
nt|andyv:  although W would have to guess whether to try to cash the 3rd @s or cash 2@cs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: 1n balance by West?|pg||
nt|psyck:  Official website: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourIndex.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C a spade raise |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes even with 1 pt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C for EW has good play in this badly distributed hand.|pg||
nt|sybarra: junky @D suit to introduce|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was a question....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2s is so automatic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact i would hope to be studying dummy about now|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you consider a dble of 2 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what that would mean|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes with north hand to confirm real suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: and hope pard doesnt leap off the deep end in @D's|pg||
nt|peachy: Playing "could be 2" club, it could even mean "got them".  Other meanings also possible, like extra values or hearts and extra values|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is brown in browning motion|pg||
nt|peachy: we've had technical difficulties, lets hope this is not prelude to a crash|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen this slow bidding before here|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@c probably promise 3+ as noted with previous board|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe lots of questions and writing?|pg||
nt|peachy: N opened 1C with AKx diam and xx clubs earlier|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont care if 1c promises 0, 2c is by default a cue bid|pg||
nt|twcho: she opened 1@d with that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C has to be a spade raise |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think |pg||
nt|twcho: only the CR North opened 1@c|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: The case of the missing initial pass.|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad, 1@h by S would have been more fun|pg||
nt|andyv:  awkward dbl by W unless it shows a Major and Minor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that one will be hard to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S should be happy to sit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: me too Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: dangerous for us to play maybe Gary?|pg||
nt|twcho: what is 3@c?|pg||
nt|twcho: seems 3@d a better description for her hand|pg||
nt|psyck:  looking for a @c stop from pd for 3n i guess intending to go to 5@d else|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  ah, it is just that|pg||
nt|kemperg: good in honneurs, but shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  no a matter of overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: the critical point was W not to get trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 5@SX was 500 a 5 imps to jiegao|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree but timid pass by E of NT.:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed it was|pg||
nt|blewah: i don't see very often now, with 12 count|pg||
nt|rv: this shows 11-14, it could even go upto 15 hcp in some partnerships because of 1@s is inconvinient |pg||
nt|psyck:  5@d best here with 4@s in trouble|pg||
nt|twcho: and 3N hopeless|pg||
nt|gracelin: and 3NT in deeper trouble.|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@d should be a much better bid than 3@c imo|pg||
nt|psyck:  E intends this seq to show dobts about 3N|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, I agree with Tommy, East has better bid 3D instead of 3C last round.|pg||
nt|psyck:  i do agree that 3@d would have been preferable to 3@c|pg||
nt|twcho: with east overcalling, EW bid to the unbeatable 4@s contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh dear me |pg||
nt|panosk: wud have like 4 small spades vul |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H not best |pg||
nt|ssbux: can they stop in 3H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W does like her hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: one day hopefully, we will put that to the test|pg||
nt|gracelin: Dekkers gets the message about doubt of 3NT.|pg||
nt|psyck:  W takes out 3N with no @c stop|pg||
nt|twcho: although 5@d needs careful handling to make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: I only bid..look at the distribution....let pard know I have 3 @S  |pg||
nt|panosk: W cant acrually go higher, E might have KQ in @S|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h is a fair game-unlucky @c break beats it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Thereis no point in playing negative doubles if East passes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if EW forgot what they were playing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|kemperg: no system against 1NT:(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@C by E and 2@D by W. |pg||
nt|andyv:  with 8 tricks off the top, this should be a nice pick up for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  W dbl, unless conventional, was ill advised.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a big Pass from East|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could be expensive since EW don't have a game|pg||

nt|sybarra: I have other forcing bids,  dbls etc |pg||
nt|twcho: ok, delayed @d|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|gracelin: yes, need almost double dummy to make.  Instead of ruffing 3rd round H, declarer need to ruff out SQ before playing K, and Q of trumps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: But as other room was -2 at 3NT, EW will not lose the board here, whatever the game they choose.|pg||
nt|twcho: but at least this line isn't impossible|pg||
nt|twcho: probably one round of trump first|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E was too strong for 1NT anyway|pg||
nt|panosk: which wud be a waste|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s is doomed|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: you are risking Spade 5-1 to protect H 7-1.  No declarer will find that double dummy play.|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer has a dilemma without solution|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: 3 losers and home.|pg||
nt|rv: yes in practise most partnerships will get to 4@h|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: Many IMPs are lost by those who "compensate" for their underweight earlier actions by making non-systemic auction-ending passes later.|pg||
nt|andyv:  with dbl and michaels available, I wonder why S chose to bid such a raggedy suit|pg||
nt|peachy: you are all right, it was Closed rm N who did it. Sorry to talk nonsense, but sometimes nonsense happens!|pg||
mc|10|nt|twcho: probably going for a finesse in trump now|pg||

nt|sybarra: agree panos |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no opening S no preempt W|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: routine hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: might make 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this hand easy to play from here...at the table, N will have problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you have to have discussion with pard,  as to what bids mean as passed hand |pg||
nt|rnmalik: any major suit contract losing 3 aces only:)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: That low:)|pg||
nt|blewah: pass?|pg||
nt|panosk: but its not beter than finess|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: except when pard misreads it|pg||
nt|sybarra: that maybe is result of X |pg||
nt|sybarra: W had best find 4 @S (imo)|pg||
nt|panosk: what do you think about double as t/o from E straight after 3@C?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS almost make 3N on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I prefer 3 @S,  not resulting,  but I do not have 4 @H's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ideal Panos, says I have @H + @D + tolerance for @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pause - North "knows" where @SJ is...?|pg||
nt|loe48: well it was a marked stop as i dont like to see..but poor connection? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: May have been better take 1st @S trick here as @S blocked|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|loe48: but pretty much be the same as have entress anyways|pg||
nt|kerasidis: could even give the impression that he has Ajx in spdes :)'|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they played ELC, then N was on track to do just that (show the 2 suits)|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are doiing fine:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed to make the contract but timing of suit play  has to be good.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E only has 6 pts |pg||
nt|twcho: east secure her contract by establishing her @d|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kemperg: duck and it goes of it own>)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that the X doesnt promise a bit more |pg||
nt|sybarra: from E |pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcwla: N's @S holding means S is not going to convert a X - and N not going to sit for @C's - so what is the point of X rather than a 2-suited bid that would surely slow S down?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: another big swing for Dutch here|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: dealing with todays preempts means you sometimes have to lower the point requirements|pg||
nt|blewah: and they are minotities in this world of modern bidding|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|blewah: minorities|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|panosk: tough call i have no positive answer either|pg||
nt|sybarra: from my point of view,  the X would include k of @H's for example|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont think its enough for a X |pg||
nt|sybarra: now, if playing neg frees,  perhaps he bids 3 @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe with spade tolerance he can bid 3 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but that cuts the possible @H fit|pg||
nt|rv: inspite of unlucky slam deal for English ladies, Dutch women have definitely played more consistent bridge and deserve this victory|pg||
nt|twcho: so some more imps for Netherlands|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: Something like what happened seems relatively foreseeable.|pg||
nt|andyv:  was S hand worth a 3@c bid with this vul?|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems bad but no problems now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even now makes.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rnmalik: @D switch.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  with everyon play 2way new minor and xyz and pdq, etc....2@c has almost become non existent as a spot to play|pg||
mc|7|nt|andyv:  S will have to be careful here not to lose 3@c tricks|pg||
