pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|henryb:  David Bird comments that the transfer followed by 3N will sometimes be an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|psyck:  that would be more the case on 2N opening, which is why many allways go to 4M with 3 card major fit then|pg||
nt|henryb:  And therefore opener should always bid 4M with 3 card support|pg||
nt|psyck:  on 1N there are more options, especially by passed hand|pg||
nt|psyck:  *more options with distributional hand with responder...|pg||
nt|robbg:  Well the point was made on voice, and I agree that with 5 (3-1) 4 responder should not always rebid clubs, which suggests that it is less attractive to pass with 3 spades.|pg||
nt|henryb:  By the way, if you are not getting the voice, sign off and come back on the browser version of BBO|pg||

nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are right Joao|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: a bit cloudy in London today |pg||
nt|jfaria:  could well be a transfer, just guessing :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jfaria:  with 4 loosers hard to guess a happy ending|pg||
nt|jfaria:  same result both rooms i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  even with a helpful lead, this is not an easy hand to play (or to make)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|bg: good spot for first board s/b 110|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sfoxa:  and margin is 13 VP till 2nd placed team|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the T can be costy...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I would play 2@c to show A@d rather than 10@c because of danger of discarding @d's|pg||
nt|jfaria:  must play a @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but they might have diffrent signals|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  the problem with playing high clubs from S is what to pitch from the dummy|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  plain board for a start|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
nt|warrens:  he could pitch a @S and a @H|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bg: good contract the old moysian fit:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  though, without N's bid, EW may well land into 3NT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  comfortable standing|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bg: I guess systemically that N could not bid 3 spades over 3 hearts|pg||
nt|kjadams: Perfect fit here. |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bg: S playing for  a club honor onside this isnt going to work|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this start, S can rely on double finess in @c, but it doesn't work, unfortunately|pg||
nt|bg: W worried about possible but improbable 5 card trump stack may now switch to dia and let them ruff|pg||
nt|warrens:  now it should be clear for W to play a @S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|vugraphznr: not sure what Artu's plan is now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like Greek gift|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Artur's|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but that' not the end|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  discarding 2 @d now is easy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bg: the spade 9 would control a heart return|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 rounds of @d could have following by 2 rounds of @c - just to become sure neither defernder has 5 spades|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all, bid and made - that matters|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  luckily. @s J is second|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  otherwise, finess is necessary now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: and @s was thrown away by N|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  and 4 more tricks for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Janet played 2-5-6 hearts showing no @d values but it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bg: but bidding 3 spades to me is better than a pass even if it showed 4 spades|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|kjadams: tough guess here.  if D king off, then spade through would block the diamonds.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  the line of play looks reasonable|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  supposingly, 1@h bid was for spades|pg||
nt|kjadams: really aggressive 3N.   This is not going to do well.|pg||
nt|bg: NS destined to fail no matter where they end up|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  20 to 20 points - Roland's favourite hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but now Janet may have trouble with bidding her hand, i suppose|pg||
nt|jfaria:  micro st by E|pg||
nt|jfaria:  stolling many @c contract to NS|pg||

nt|bg: aggressive|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd like to know the reason not to bid @s with W hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes, it was transfer|pg||
nt|jfaria:  or even a @h game|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  ok, landed safely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S woke up in time :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder, which card E chooses for return |pg||
pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  oh, I anticipated @c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  yes, defenders have no chance to @c trick |pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: @C start needed|pg||
nt|kjadams: seems that with misfit, going low can win, and 2H likely to make.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bg: I agree 2 H by N enough if South has a bigger Michaels then he will bid again|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kjadams: Good partner returning my suit!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bg: E doesnt know that N has only one spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but @s switch seems to be safe|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after @s discard from dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bg: good switch now we will see if EW on same wavelenght as to count|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  admit, this time the lay of the cards isn't pretty good for EW, but playing 2@s seems good|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bg: W duck one dia continue club Q no play|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kemperg: in other systems W could do 2 @S, 4-8, 6crd|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|nt|kemperg: 3@C must have been gameforcing|pg||
nt|kjadams: now the hard part.  playing partner for club Q not so easy.   maybe since partner did not pitch one?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E has to find return now|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bg: wrong play now 2 clubs makes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bg: had to kill dummy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, spade return could have been better|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now will play for dropping 10@c I think|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  good play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now @h ruff and @c ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: would you have bid 3@H? not me|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bg: I agree with you Sveta I do not understand why many players will bid 1nt after 1 heart instead of 1 spade|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 4-3-3-3 split - quite OK, but this time...|pg||
nt|bg: just lead club to J and lead dia J|pg||
nt|kemperg: would have been interesting here:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may overruf, but has to play|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jfaria:  very brave i guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: not me|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kemperg: no defense any more|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  I should consider this approach - positive bid having an ace in hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bg: silly defense|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4-2 fit ugly but at 50 a trick, no serious damage.|pg||
nt|warrens:  S should know that North is trump tight.  but here it doesn't matter what he plays.  150 for N/S|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kemperg: any grand is on for EW|pg||

nt|kemperg: Very distracting to hear Roland talking:):)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kemperg: modern bidding by EW, 2@D as switch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now 4@s bid looks like obligatory|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S had been @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W should find reasons to continue the bidding|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  no way - it seems|pg||

nt|kemperg: N on the brink of an invite|pg||
nt|kemperg: I couldn't|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - grand relied of a finess of trump K - isn't the good one|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl lokking for a better suit then @H?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or the team match pressure worked? it seems so|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @S finesse now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after this lead he will play spades from top|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and after this start, @sK is going to take the trick - declarer may be afraid of @d ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|bg: then S misplayed only made 5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bg: good decision by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hot start|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H competitive, dbl = invite|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bg: aggressive E might have been better off trying 2 dia instead of 2 hearts showing 10 points or so sure spade support is weak but the alternative of 2 Hearts led them too high|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, even 2 tricks in @s for NS become problematic|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  agree - distribution encourages|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N just does not believe...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, W could be hardly blamed for his 3@h bid - E may well have an ace more|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  EW have easy 3NT, but this juicy defence brings more |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bg: E should balance I think usually bad result to let opps play 1h-2h|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|vugraphznr: what would be 3@d instead of 3@h ? isnt like better /weak support with heart fit ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this agreement suits well to the situation|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and a lot of pairs playing opps suit as maximum (passed or bid) hand with fit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bg: good thought but depends on partnership understanding Engine and caboose have to be on same track|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, this time 7 tricks are in view - not bad|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jfaria:  2@h must be @h and... with 11 cards and @h fit W decided to take a chance|pg||
nt|jfaria:  this may proove expensive|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  end is good - everything's good|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  opne room started with  9 - so we have first comparison|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I think W forgot about colours...|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|bg: Board one S had easy 3 nt with spade lead|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  4@s seems to be good save|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sfoxa:  oh - no need even|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: do you agree with S pass after 2@s?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  probably thet are playing variable nt or a strong believe not to open 1nt with 5 c M|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5 imps for defending in both rooms.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hard to say|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS may win 6@c on @s guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5@c seems safe|pg||
nt|bg: have to be careful in heart slam a finesse would be fatal|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sfoxa:  with N as declarer, contract is safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  same for 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  what would you lead with W hand after such an auction?|pg||
nt|kemperg: W almost endplayed now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: @C for me|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @s for me - both of no use this time|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d looks as the same pain|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4 diamonds, 4 hearts, 1 club 1 spade..  Needs two club ruffs, but the overruff is a problem.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: Interesting rules question.   we all could see that 1S was down only 3 on previous board, but in Bridge, the Kibitzers can't tell the players, so if the players score it as down 4, ...|pg||
nt|kjadams: so be it.|pg||
nt|kjadams: they have to catch it themselves..|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kemperg: no, dnl for me|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: btw 2@s was a good decision, may would bid simply 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: many*|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  @s game looks not worse, actually|pg||
nt|kemperg: same start in OR, but S rebid 2 @S , @D was not mentioned|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: here 2@s would be 6+@s, thats what N explained|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kjadams: we can see that Rabbi's rule works (when the stiff king offside, Drop it), but at the table, I'd probably go down.|pg||
nt|warrens:  what was the purpose of 2@D?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jfaria:  12 imps gain on B2, again as expected|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, i see, checkback for @H's|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kjadams: Let's say he starts with ace and a club...  after the over ruff, still has to guess hearts.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  and this line may well reduce declarer's tricks with 9 only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may clear @d now|pg||
nt|bg: this line guards against a heart switch but turns out ok since W has club ace|pg||
nt|bg: right if he drops king then slam makes|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks very straightforward|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sfoxa:  that's good bid opposite passed partner - when no game is in view|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bg: N should bid 4 clubs show that he has a few clubs he has already shown three hearts anywat they stopped in right spot|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this game seems better than 4@h |pg||
nt|kjadams: Momentary nervousnous about missing slam with turn to rejoice when he sees splits.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  2@s I mean|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  communication problems are closer|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sfoxa:  I'll never know, why one is sure about @cA in this postion|pg||
nt|kemperg: are they playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to guess @c now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  cunningly done|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kemperg: no defense left|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|jfaria:  lots of tricks now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first lead was good, but this spade continuation - just splendid|pg||
nt|warrens:  making at least 5, possibly 6 on a @C @D squeeze|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:  another way possible - now W waits with @d and @cQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bg: yes 4 hearts depends on club guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: more simply establish a @s|pg||
nt|kemperg: @SJ and W is in trouble|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now he can throw @d and next?|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H finesse is needed any how, do that now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @h is communication line, should be kept|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but battle till the end|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  ok, next board )))|pg||

nt|kjadams: The play seems very fast, and they are still playing well despite the speed.|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now they entering all previous scores to Bridgemate, so 1 minute break :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: W threw a club after dummy threw one also|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: yes, p has no opening|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: i'm guessing hearts wins at this vurn|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: still a mchance to miss game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bg: EW need a systemic bid here like 2 clubs for majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  or so. NS may well get defensive in 4@s - appearing to be good contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  W's hand asks for bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  very tiny multi, should admit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  and S with the same weapon|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: agree|pg||
nt|jfaria:  im afraid @h wiil not apear|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sfoxa:  but worked well|pg||
nt|kemperg: green against red|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  then, @d comes in play|pg||
nt|bg: EW have good save in 5 hearts but will not find it unlessW bids|pg||
nt|kjadams: I am reminded that these are mostly rubber bridge players, and time is money!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sfoxa:  I wonder, if N's 2nt bid will promis minors in this situation|pg||
nt|bg: ok I understand the players can toss cards for the last few tricks faster than any operator can key them in|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kjadams: Though bridge is a game of skill, Slam luck can turn a match, and the de Botton team was most unfortunate to lose on that board.   If slam makes, its win 11 instead of lose 11.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  nevertheless - 8 easy tricks for NS|pg||
nt|bg: 120 or 130 S passes gets the 120|pg||
nt|jfaria:  so a "minor" sacrifice...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: good point|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bg: good S should respect N decision not to accept any higher aspirations|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  even 5@d is far from plain play, if any|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  I'm afraid Pepsi wont like last 14 imps swing...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  he smiles in face of any result )))|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S 10 ditribution or @H signal?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to bid with W hand - suit is very weak|pg||
nt|warrens:  S needs to lead a @D and not a @C here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jfaria:  N usually plays the TENS in p lead :)|pg||

nt|warrens:  agreed|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C 10 was no succes:(|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hard job for E|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C and @H, but then N has to play trump|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kjadams: good lead|pg||

nt|warrens:  if N shifts, it's all over|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|warrens:  E really wishes he had 2 entries to his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after @h lead N knew E has at least 4 hearts|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bg: can get sluff ruff if N concedes two spade tricks after cashing AK hearts and ruffing out last club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bg: this game wrong sided  NS will pick up 2 imps if they cash out clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: OR caught up with us|pg||

nt|jfaria:  well, those 10 from B4 unexpected to me...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  this time no game for EW, but next one may be. and I don't know, if W can afford to double|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|kemperg: lots of trump tricks were possible|pg||
nt|jfaria:  $ boards 4 majors swings, nice to watch :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: given alot of dollars:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4 boards - 4 two-digit swing, yes|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kjadams: 6 tricks in,  can try for 2 clubs and a diamond, or try to set up heart.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  and this one may appear not a push, too|pg||
nt|kjadams: the club lead broke up the diamond entry position as well.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  but the matter of course may well be repeated next door|pg||
nt|warrens:  seems natural to play @C's and hope the defense gets it wrong or the @C's come home|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  and in this board, S is a wizzard. all 3 key cards (@dA, @hK and @sQ) are wrong placed|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: some discussion at the table about  prev board but dont know Bulgarian :/|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  still no push :) what a final match!|pg||
nt|jfaria:  to loose just 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: well done at both tables|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sfoxa:  they are fast - 7 boards in half-an-hour and little bit more|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|kemperg: very fast|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  special challenge for the operator :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I've done more challenging ones :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: another 8 suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  a good 3nt here, but have to get there first.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|warrens:  maybe 2@D now, followed by 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kjadams: Many pairs play transfer advances of partners major after a negative double.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: where transfer to opps suit = limit raise|pg||
nt|warrens:  or even followed by 2N here|pg||
nt|warrens:  i admit, i didn't expect 2@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bg: here is a great slam make 7 double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  @h fit is discovered, but right contract is NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  fine boards for the last match, when swings are necessary )))|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: other table 4hxx ... in prev , now playing|pg||
nt|bg: 2 D should be about a 10 point raise N should bid 2 spades and thats it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kemperg: do the Romanians have Bulgarian?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS are from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeh, but their opps not|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: if -1 no bid deal :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: hmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  from one hand, 5@d is a good save, from another - you may well force your opps to go higher|pg||
nt|kjadams: transfer to our suit = constructive raise, and bidding our suit is garbage.|pg||
nt|bg: not sure what 2 H meant|pg||
nt|kjadams: let's hope they do not both try double moysian spade fit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kemperg: 1 down at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Herman team got hard stroke in  1, when EW next door bid and went down in 3NT, but now, imp by imp, they gain the lead|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2H should be a last train type of game try in case 2D stronger than limit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  after @dQ falls, only @h finess is necessary|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  obvious 3NT, but after informative bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kjadams: this does not look to be  a pretty contract.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jfaria:  same ten tricks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sfoxa:  normal line of play in @h brings 9th trick|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|kjadams: Seems to me that east was worth a direct 2S Q|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, this has to be doomed.  seems like an easy hand to defend.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|jfaria:  a no swing board? :)|pg||
nt|bg: all lines of play work here but declarer not sure of any of them|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's true|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kjadams: From South's perspective, North was 4-4 in majors.   Maybe next time bid 5 card suit in response to Q bid.|pg||

mb|4D|an|cue|mb|p|mb|4S|an|cue|mb|p|nt|robbg:  The e-w bidding is a strong club method. The east 3@c rebid meaning is unclear, possibly a splinter.|pg||
nt|psyck:  several chances in slam, none of which materialize here|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|psyck:  though it is pointed out that 6NT can make double dummy|pg||
nt|robbg:  RKCB would have kept them out of this fair slam, but they chose a different route.|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|robbg:  6NT is actually a good slam, but not really biddable. 6@h is only fair. On this lie the latter will make, the former will fail on a club lead.|pg||
