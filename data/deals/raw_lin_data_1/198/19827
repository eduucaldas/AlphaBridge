mb|p|nt|jfaria:  in the open Roland is talking loud and and clear, maybe we can try morse here :)|pg||
nt|bg: GM all|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: Welcome from sunny London :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  welcome to TGR - first auction teams event |pg||
nt|bg: S should try 3 nt now|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hi John|pg||
nt|bg: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|granguru:  bid what you think you can make system|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  sunny indeed?|pg||

nt|granguru:  plus only a @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: Hi svata Jacec and kibs|pg||
nt|kjadams: these are the two leading teams after two rounds.   de Botton has 34 VP, to Estertons 33|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello Germ|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: yes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: claim before playing 1st trick :-)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bg: rain here enjoy:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's special teams event, details to be found here http://www.tgrsbridge.com/ |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as far as I know, 3 group with 6 teams each are on their way|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: today we have 5 rounds (matches)|pg||
nt|bg:  S cashes 5 dia club ace and endplays W|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  RR in groups?|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  NS completed a team with decent Polish pair Gawrys-Kalita rapidly moving to the top of Polish bridge during last 2 seasons|pg||
nt|kjadams: a helpful lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the final of 1st TGR Auction teams|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@d gf stayman |pg||
nt|kemperg: Nice, transfer after 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are right Joao|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: a bit cloudy in London today |pg||
nt|jfaria:  could well be a transfer, just guessing :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jfaria:  with 4 loosers hard to guess a happy ending|pg||
nt|jfaria:  same result both rooms i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  even with a helpful lead, this is not an easy hand to play (or to make)|pg||
nt|baldjean: this 3nt will get into trouble. but it was logical to reach it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: may we still have the  "Skov - Rassmusen" as tone of tha pairs from norway? Sems as as some are better to know the people.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bg: good spot for first board s/b 110|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sfoxa:  and margin is 13 VP till 2nd placed team|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the T can be costy...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I would play 2@c to show A@d rather than 10@c because of danger of discarding @d's|pg||
nt|jfaria:  must play a @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but they might have diffrent signals|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  the problem with playing high clubs from S is what to pitch from the dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  plain board for a start|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
nt|warrens:  he could pitch a @S and a @H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bg: good contract the old moysian fit:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  elimination play now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  though, without N's bid, EW may well land into 3NT|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  comfortable standing|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bg: I guess systemically that N could not bid 3 spades over 3 hearts|pg||
nt|kjadams: Perfect fit here. |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s and @h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bg: S playing for  a club honor onside this isnt going to work|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this start, S can rely on double finess in @c, but it doesn't work, unfortunately|pg||
nt|bg: W worried about possible but improbable 5 card trump stack may now switch to dia and let them ruff|pg||
nt|warrens:  now it should be clear for W to play a @S|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cK|nt|vugraphznr: not sure what Artu's plan is now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like Greek gift|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Artur's|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but that' not the end|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|granguru:  not needed in fact|pg||
nt|granguru:  claim time|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|baldjean: @h continuation by E would have been better at trick 2|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  discarding 2 @d now is easy|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bg: the spade 9 would control a heart return|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 rounds of @d could have following by 2 rounds of @c - just to become sure neither defernder has 5 spades|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all, bid and made - that matters|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  luckily. @s J is second|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  otherwise, finess is necessary now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: and @s was thrown away by N|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  and 4 more tricks for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Janet played 2-5-6 hearts showing no @d values but it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bg: but bidding 3 spades to me is better than a pass even if it showed 4 spades|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|kjadams: tough guess here.  if D king off, then spade through would block the diamonds.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  the line of play looks reasonable|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
mc|9|nt|kjadams: though this line essentially played for king in same hand.|pg||

nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2H|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
pc|cA|nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  took time for count 10, i suppose :) |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  present for a start for Wigoder |pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I'm impressed of Bulgarian play yesterday, they play edexcellent bridge|pg||
nt|warrens:  very strong result for N/S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: Or areplaying board 39 and 40|pg||
nt|granguru:  if E had @cK10xx then he might have been in a problem|pg||
nt|granguru:  1@C precision, which is standard in Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: it is some modified Precision more similar to Polish Club  here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kemperg: no comparison now|pg||
nt|bg: 2nd hand should also be +110:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sfoxa:  they started from 39, indeed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa:  looks like partscore battle, especially after W's bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sfoxa:  @s game for NS, no more|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3@h would be too much at this vulnerabilty situation|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: only 2@h overcall gave NS some more space|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphznr: we playing 31 to 40 in this round|pg||
nt|granguru:  ok |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  nice bid opposite passed partner - NS are out of bidding|pg||
nt|bg: this should make lose 3 hearts dia and a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  supposingly, 1@h bid was for spades|pg||
nt|kjadams: really aggressive 3N.   This is not going to do well.|pg||
nt|bg: NS destined to fail no matter where they end up|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@C is supposely Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: y|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, but I would rather not overcall 3@h with W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  20 to 20 points - Roland's favourite hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but now Janet may have trouble with bidding her hand, i suppose|pg||
nt|jfaria:  micro st by E|pg||
nt|jfaria:  stolling many @c contract to NS|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|bg: oops a little GGRESSIVE|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm. not impossible|pg||
nt|bg: aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H is competitive|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sfoxa:  I'd like to know the reason not to bid @s with W hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes, it was transfer|pg||
nt|jfaria:  or even a @h game|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: current standings in final: 1. Esterson 74VP, 2. De Botton 58, 3. Naqvi 55 and 4. Widoger 53 VPs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  ok, landed safely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S woke up in time :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  I wonder, which card E chooses for return |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, I anticipated @c|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  yes, defenders have no chance to @c trick |pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: @C start needed|pg||
nt|kjadams: seems that with misfit, going low can win, and 2H likely to make.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bg: I agree 2 H by N enough if South has a bigger Michaels then he will bid again|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kjadams: Good partner returning my suit!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bg: E doesnt know that N has only one spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but @s switch seems to be safe|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after @s discard from dummy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bg: good switch now we will see if EW on same wavelenght as to count|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  admit, this time the lay of the cards isn't pretty good for EW, but playing 2@s seems good|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bg: W duck one dia continue club Q no play|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kemperg: in other systems W could do 2 @S, 4-8, 6crd|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru:  a small @c first improuves a little defense options|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|an|.|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck:  I play 1@s by E as 4+ cards & x with less|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
pc|sA|nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|granguru:  using all kind of transfers at the one level in order to force overcaller to lead as much as possible|pg||
nt|danilo1: difficult to believe in this trick|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Indeed!|pg||
nt|danilo1: did it really happen?|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Suppose he's playing safe|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Against @ss 4-1.|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Keeping trump control this way.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  to concede 1 club at the end|pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start seemed clear|pg||
nt|bg: well played down one good result  other than stopping in 2 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  not obvious line at the table|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|kemperg: any grand is on for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  huge hand for EW|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4 now|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  S's tiny opening allows EW staying low, I hope|pg||
nt|kemperg: but 6 is normal bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but they have to discover their might|pg||
nt|kemperg: Very distracting to hear Roland talking:):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: this looks like a normal 4@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: modern bidding by EW, 2@D as switch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now 4@s bid looks like obligatory|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S had been @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W should find reasons to continue the bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: how do you find @SK is missing?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  no way - it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: Open room North bid 3S directly on bd 21|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|kemperg: N on the brink of an invite|pg||
nt|kemperg: I couldn't|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - grand relied of a finess of trump K - isn't the good one|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl lokking for a better suit then @H?|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@d inv minors|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  or the team match pressure worked? it seems so|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @S finesse now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after this lead he will play spades from top|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and after this start, @sK is going to take the trick - declarer may be afraid of @d ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  2NT sotppers in @H and @s|pg||
nt|barbyh: hello Barbara from Las Vegas|pg||
nt|baldjean: hi Barbara|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: hello|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|bg: then S misplayed only made 5|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bg: good decision by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hot start|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H competitive, dbl = invite|pg||
nt|barbyh: solid contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bg: aggressive E might have been better off trying 2 dia instead of 2 hearts showing 10 points or so sure spade support is weak but the alternative of 2 Hearts led them too high|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, even 2 tricks in @s for NS become problematic|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sfoxa:  agree - distribution encourages|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N just does not believe...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  yes, W could be hardly blamed for his 3@h bid - E may well have an ace more|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW have easy 3NT, but this juicy defence brings more |pg||
nt|baldjean: if N does not continue Q@h it will be 12 tricks even|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|bg: E should balance I think usually bad result to let opps play 1h-2h|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: what would be 3@d instead of 3@h ? isnt like better /weak support with heart fit ?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  end is good - everything's good|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  opne room started with  9 - so we have first comparison|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I think W forgot about colours...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bg: Board one S had easy 3 nt with spade lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|granguru:  2@s weak 3@c competittive, NF, no 4@H probably|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  oh - no need even|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: do you agree with S pass after 2@s?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  probably thet are playing variable nt or a strong believe not to open 1nt with 5 c M|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5 imps for defending in both rooms.|pg||
nt|granguru:  e shows cards not  penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: correct|pg||
nt|baldjean: this can make 6@h|pg||
nt|baldjean: but will they get there?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa:  hard to say|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS may win 6@c on @s guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5@c seems safe|pg||
nt|bg: have to be careful in heart slam a finesse would be fatal|pg||
nt|granguru:  Now sputh must think W has no 4@H, 5+@c some @s for the pass.--most problabe hand after this lead is 3-3-1-6|pg||
nt|granguru:  without @HAK|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  with N as declarer, contract is safe|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  same for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: not easy to make though|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: this sequence shows medium slamish interest I guess|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, and W is probably worried about the @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: not sure about their agreement but 2nt should show some !@d values - he could have bid 2@s as 4th suit, W has nice hand to make one more step in may opinion|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, I agree. I would take that additional step too|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 2@d as 4th suit|pg||
nt|barbyh: does he know partner has a stiff club?|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I doubt|pg||
nt|barbyh: then that may be of concern|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  what would you lead with W hand after such an auction?|pg||
nt|kemperg: W almost endplayed now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: @C for me|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @s for me - both of no use this time|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d looks as the same pain|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4 diamonds, 4 hearts, 1 club 1 spade..  Needs two club ruffs, but the overruff is a problem.|pg||
nt|baldjean: probably not, but that's what an additional bid can find out. 4@s to show short @s|pg||
nt|barbyh: would be much easier to bid knowing that|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kjadams: Interesting rules question.   we all could see that 1S was down only 3 on previous board, but in Bridge, the Kibitzers can't tell the players, so if the players score it as down 4, ...|pg||
nt|kjadams: so be it.|pg||
nt|kjadams: they have to catch it themselves..|pg||
nt|rodal f: ate to see some who might well will play some good bridge for England.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: no, dnl for me|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: btw 2@s was a good decision, may would bid simply 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: many*|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  @s game looks not worse, actually|pg||
nt|kemperg: same start in OR, but S rebid 2 @S , @D was not mentioned|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: here 2@s would be 6+@s, thats what N explained|pg||
nt|granguru:  so most probable @SKxx @Ha(Q)x @Dx @cA(q)xxxx|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kjadams: we can see that Rabbi's rule works (when the stiff king offside, Drop it), but at the table, I'd probably go down.|pg||
nt|warrens:  what was the purpose of 2@D?|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Hate to see|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jfaria:  12 imps gain on B2, again as expected|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, i see, checkback for @H's|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kjadams: Let's say he starts with ace and a club...  after the over ruff, still has to guess hearts.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  and this line may well reduce declarer's tricks with 9 only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may clear @d now|pg||
nt|bg: this line guards against a heart switch but turns out ok since W has club ace|pg||
nt|bg: right if he drops king then slam makes|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks very straightforward|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  that's good bid opposite passed partner - when no game is in view|pg||
nt|granguru:  defese tires to reduce @C ruffs power by leading  trum now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bg: N should bid 4 clubs show that he has a few clubs he has already shown three hearts anywat they stopped in right spot|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this game seems better than 4@h |pg||
nt|kjadams: Momentary nervousnous about missing slam with turn to rejoice when he sees splits.|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  2@s I mean|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  another way possible - now W waits with @d and @cQ|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: more simply establish a @s|pg||
nt|kemperg: @SJ and W is in trouble|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now he can throw @d and next?|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  yes, one more challenge for E|pg||

nt|kemperg: OK ty now itys clearto me|pg||
nt|kemperg: typing almost as bad as my chipps at golf to day:(|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C start was needed|pg||
nt|bg: good partnership understanding here most pairs would not have 3 clubs in their system to show the S hand|pg||
nt|bg: good point|pg||
nt|granguru:  @H finesse and @D |pg||
nt|granguru:  @d 3-3|pg||
nt|granguru:  d@D 4-2 with Hx falling|pg||
nt|granguru:  @d QJ onside|pg||
nt|granguru:  @S QJ alone|pg||
nt|granguru:  and a red trick|pg||
nt|granguru:  so best is to attack @D|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now if E ducks W has no easy exit|pg||
nt|granguru:  E must overtake and repeat|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|kemperg: wont have E in|pg||
nt|granguru:  asked@S with @C9|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: I guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphznr: x was explained as extras, probably @s support|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kjadams: Many pairs play transfer advances of partners major after a negative double.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: where transfer to opps suit = limit raise|pg||
nt|warrens:  or even followed by 2N here|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: other table 4hxx ... in prev , now playing|pg||
nt|bg: 2 D should be about a 10 point raise N should bid 2 spades and thats it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kemperg: do the Romanians have Bulgarian?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS are from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeh, but their opps not|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: if -1 no bid deal :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: hmmm|pg||
nt|granguru:  2NT conventional|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  from one hand, 5@d is a good save, from another - you may well force your opps to go higher|pg||
nt|kjadams: transfer to our suit = constructive raise, and bidding our suit is garbage.|pg||
nt|bg: not sure what 2 H meant|pg||
nt|kjadams: let's hope they do not both try double moysian spade fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now they are on their way|pg||

pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  Herman team got hard stroke in  1, when EW next door bid and went down in 3NT, but now, imp by imp, they gain the lead|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2H should be a last train type of game try in case 2D stronger than limit.|pg||
nt|granguru:  E didnt transfered with such a strong hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  after @dQ falls, only @h finess is necessary|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  obvious 3NT, but after informative bidding|pg||

mb|p|nt|bg: another not unreasonable slam that will fail on distribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  when everything fails the cieling goes down on you|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sfoxa:  is it the top amount?|pg||
nt|bg: I can imagine  spade break un lucky but no need to cash spade king|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: and this was the top amount|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and how does the standing look like, actually?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, EW prevented opps from @h game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tiny, but game|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: lead of @C 9 what was the system on that?|pg||
nt|kemperg: all pass|pg||
nt|warrens:  though finding out you're off an ace and the Q of trumps should keep them out of  6|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: agressive 1nt :)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|vugraphznr: 2@c Precision style|pg||
nt|kjadams: There is an advanced convention that helps avoid grand slams off a cashing Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  EW next door manage to bid this slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what about this pair?|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont see the 1 up|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ok @S at W but goog enough?|pg||
nt|baldjean: no game in sight for E/W|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sfoxa:  and vul. sacrifice that works |pg||
nt|jfaria:  W is looking at colours remebering B3|pg||
nt|warrens:  omg|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: vuln. save:)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but this time he guessed ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: good board for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d start is necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after @s lead 5@h should make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting choice|pg||
nt|rodal f: *good|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sfoxa:  with the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Gustawsson was sold for 500|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: do not like 2nt rebid 2 dia reverse then raise hearts better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  only when defence goes asleep|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 2@s was corrected to 3|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: so should jump a@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: overall pool money are 22.500 gbp|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  kind of gadget could be usefull for EW, showing 6 cards suit and not minimum hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: lost of comment by specs, nice:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots:(|pg||
nt|kemperg: S had a pass on 2 @D so N knows they are high enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: oh my|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: very lucky slam at other table|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  and cash @d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I meant 3NT by S - rather demonstrating @s stopper|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Skov is a lovly lad by 203 and got his nick name "Superbaby" by his nice behaviour.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kemperg: 2@S of W said if you have @H then bid else pass|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@d was Multi|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  looks like NS are on their way to @c  slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  grand???|pg||
nt|bg: now they cannot know about club queen they may bid 7 and get lucky|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky indeed - no possibility to get wrong|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphznr: 1. Gustawsson - 3800, 2. Ventin - 3500 3. Herman - 2400 |pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 4. Widoger - 2100, 5. De Botton - 1600, 6. Garvey - 1400|pg||
nt|kjadams: should lose 1S 1D.  next.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphznr: there are many imps in this round in both ways|pg||
nt|kemperg: @SK now?|pg||
nt|kemperg: entrys are a big problem here|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont see more then 8 tricks max.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  each line of play choosen by declarer, leads to one down, unfortunately |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if defence makes no mistake|pg||
nt|bg: this will tighten up the match|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit sad to see the bid.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@S was longer @S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphznr: sry first one was Bessis of course :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: for 3800|pg||
nt|warrens:  missed a great slam, but not making|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|kemperg: 2 down possible|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  but Kendrick is second already|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bg: use the reverse to show points rather than 2nt|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|sfoxa:  last board looks rather plain, but OR has to play 17 and 18|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|sT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  but what next? if N have had only 2@h it could have been better|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Not the worst of slams, but should stop below the 6-level.|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  By a reliable source|pg||
nt|granguru:  so 2@c must be a relay according @h|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|skjaeran:  3NT asked for cuebids|pg||

nt|warrens:  5 or 7, based on the lead here|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: and a last  board of todays event|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  from the other hand, NS may well go to 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: last board might be interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  last board on this table|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but we'll wait for match result quite a while ))) |pg||

nt|vugraphznr: correct|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: S has to duck spades twice but than might be a @h switch|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sfoxa:  great job Jacek!|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: it seems like favourites Bessis will not qualify, also Herman won't|pg||
nt|kjadams: best defense can set this.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in OR, E opened his hand and went down 2 in 2 @s, here E was more carefully|pg||
nt|kemperg: so far so good|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|hJ|nt|bg: N could use 3 spades as minor suit interest but this pair may not have that in their system South would accept such a bid since a majority of his points are in the minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  particulary for this hand - very useful agreement|pg||
nt|bg: W needs a heart shift after two spades ducked|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
