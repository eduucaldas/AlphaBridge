nt|Walddk2: Not a pretty overcall|pg||

nt|rv: I don't like balancing double with West hand as well, values and length in @cs is normally not a good sign with minimum values to boot|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: mandatory double in balancing seat only with right (acceptable) shape, length in opps suit normally a strong deterrent|pg||

nt|rv: 7@c is a good vul save over making 6@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  will S bid 7 if EW get to 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's actions over E's opener will determine how much room EW have to investigate for slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a wakeup hand if ever i saw one|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 4711 is famous perfume of Eau de cologne brand, hence any hand with that shape is called perfume hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: well 4@C IS A SHOT HERE|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: 3@C SEEMS WET|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  interesting that E has a 5 loser hand and S a 4 loser hand|pg||
nt|rv: South may in again with 4n (to show longer @cs+@ds) having bid only 3@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: west feels entitled to join in|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  W has an easy bid here|pg||
nt|rv: East won't stop before slam now|pg||
nt|roswolf: danger of e/w bidding 7|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5S|nt|roswolf: south goinf solo - north should join in|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: if South bids 4n here, will North take vulnerable sac, at these colors folks are loathe to take saves:)|pg||
mb|6S|nt|veistikke:  wouldnt 5@h / 5@d helped east here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|veistikke:  dosent matter i guess :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot depends on agreements EW have regarding bidding and or passing in at the 5 level|pg||
nt|roswolf: north must bid surely|pg||
nt|andyv:  he hasn't yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: support with support|pg||

mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: another candidate for wimp of the year award|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  for my money, a direct 5@c bid over 2@c was still best..other bids to show 2 suiters, only give EW time to get their suits in|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: he wont be -4 on south's bidding|pg||
mc|12|nt|rv: at IMPs, you may not take save if it is only question of atbest 800 vs 980, at MPs it is a tougher decision|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes a round of applause for the sponsors:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  there's nothing wrong with bidding 4N over 4@c to get the @d suit in, but it still allows EW room to explore for slam|pg||
nt|rv: agree with panel for direct 5@c with South hand as well as North bidding at some stage (preferably on 3@s by West)|pg||
mb|p|nt|veistikke:  when west said 3@s north should have jumped 5@c|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rv: 16 deals in batches of 4 against every opp per session|pg||
nt|veistikke:  makes it easier for east to bid 7@c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|veistikke:  or pass 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|roswolf: prefer a 1@H overcall as west|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|s3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|rv: incidentally I prefer double instead of 2@s with South hand since he has support for @cs as well as extra values|pg||
nt|andyv:  who can double it?|pg||
mc|9|nt|rv: if South had doubled 2@h, N-S might have bought the hand in 3@d |pg||
