nt|ahollan1: if not - then expect 2@D opener from Miller|pg||
nt|gsper:  Which is Multi rather than classical Precision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: closed room starts with board  13  so we'll have comparisons after playing 22-24|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i don't think any of the New Zealand Precisioners playing 3-suited Precision 2@D opener|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = pass/correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gsper:  Otherwise, their system seems very similar to 1969 Precision|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT= is sometimes claimed to be a rare result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Stout needed @SK/Q instead of @S4|pg||
nt|gsper:  But 3NT-1 is certainly common|pg||
