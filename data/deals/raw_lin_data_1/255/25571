nt|SFoxa:  so, the match that looked so close before 4th segment, now appear not to be so anymore|pg||
pc|sK|nt|blum1956: After the huge 4th set Stoichkov took the lead. 46:34 VPs. Still 40 VPs to divide in the last two 5-board segments|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  how would it impact on the EW decisions?|pg||

nt|blum1956: Tatarkin hardly could have tried tne negative double since his hearts are too short. Diamonds are not good enough, so clubs was the only suit to play|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|SFoxa:  4@s for EW, if they manage to find it|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|nt|blum1956: 11 tricks from the West seat in spades available|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  N is squeezed in majors|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now the club ruff is necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: why?|pg||
nt|blum1956: Otherwise the declarer may ruff a diamond and take the trump finesse twice|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  even without the ruff, declarer is short of communication to make 2 spade finesses |pg||
nt|SFoxa:  so, @d resnpose is allowed. too|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: deep finesse immediately )|pg||
nt|blum1956: of course|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  100% play in goulash, you meant?|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Of course after a diamond response there will be alternative lines of play, still including the winning one|pg||
