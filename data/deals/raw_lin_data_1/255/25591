nt|gracelin: If we don't sharpen our defense, there is no hope to play against these giant teams, :)|pg||
nt|johnathan:  1@H = 14+, 5+@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|johnathan:  2N = @H fit|pg||
nt|johnathan:  or 2@C|pg||
nt|gracelin: 100% sure they will be in slam this tme|pg||
nt|johnathan:  if too strong|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 2@C is ambiguous|pg||
nt|johnathan:  2@C would be heart fit or bal or clubs GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: F1 with clubs, or balanced, or w H support|pg||
nt|johnathan:  2@H = 1-suiter or 5H-4C 14-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@Cis not GF, Jonathan|pg||
nt|johnathan:  1-suiter not necessary 14-17|pg||
nt|johnathan:  yeah you're right|pg||
nt|johnathan:  since 1@H could be 11-13 with 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/cc/OpenTeams/Monaco/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|johnathan:  2@H is game forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|johnathan:  they can stop below game after 1@H-2@C-2@D(4+@S)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|Walddk2: Maybe we are getting Turbo this time|pg||
mb|d|nt|johnathan:  4@C bypassing 3N so not minimum|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Here we have it|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Turbo this shows even number of key-card.|pg||
nt|andyv:  for you, Roland, it's Jet skiis|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/TurboConvention.pdf|pg||
nt|gracelin: telling instead of asking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just like Culbertson did|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: so North knows where to go|pg||
nt|andyv:  the play will be much faster than the auction|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|johnathan:  Fantoni knows 1 keycard missing, so straight to six|pg||

nt|fabsayc: way too good|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: Jacoby 2NT more likely to give you the information you need anyway, short @Cs would be golden, while short @Ds not so nice|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|johnathan:  2N = 7-9 3card or 5-9 4card|pg||
nt|johnathan:  3@S means 11-13 with 4oM|pg||
nt|gracelin: I learned my bridge from Culbertson.  Honor tricks and biddable suit.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Culbertson is watching, like Seve was over the weekend at Medinah|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  declarer has some work but cards lie well for him|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT is an 3-card invitation.  Fantoni can have less strength than normal since 1S opening normally is 14+|pg||

nt|gracelin: south hand maybe opened with 1NT in their method.  But Nunes upgraded to open 1S.|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|johnathan:  I think 1NT is not allowed to have 5-4 majors|pg||
