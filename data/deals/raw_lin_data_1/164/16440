nt|Vugraphzfd: apologies -- we were late getting the hands;  I recorded the auction bus missed the play.  |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Making 5?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores for Reisinger and National Swiss [plus lots of other good stuff] at http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|daman: yes   losing 1@D and 1@H|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: hi Al:)|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results are updated after each 3 board set in Reisinger  and after each match in the Swiss|pg||

nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Apparently 3 boards still not recorded|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|hedyg: totally missed the @H fit|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i have no idea what the 2@C bid in the CR meant|pg||
nt|doctorone: N did bid 4@h at some point after artificial 2@c but clearly S misunderstood the situation|pg||
nt|doctorone: S is happy he did not open 1@s after W's overcall :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Catzeflis carefully passed 4@s :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: you dont want to double opps when they are playing in your 6 card suit and see them run|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: S opened 1@s in the CR so W passed quietly|pg||
nt|doctorone: 2@s probably shown a good @h raise. S should bid 4@h now. But N may move on and the 5 level is not safe|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|doctorone: I don't quite like the 2@s bid... I would probably bid a simple 4@h over 2@h as S, especially that @ss were bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: i need 4 cards to bid 4@H directly|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|hedyg: it would show a weak hand with 4 cards fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: a weak opening|pg||
pc|s4|nt|doctorone: 4 Trefles missing a big opportunity here, as I think this will fail short a trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: loser on loser is ok|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|doctorone: discard the @c, yes... but then E may switch to a trump|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: maybe a finesse of the J@C here..|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 1 discard on the Q@C will not help a lot|pg||
nt|doctorone: Hi dima :):)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Dima :) welcome!|pg||
nt|dima:  May I ask why the score stands at 8:0?|pg||
nt|doctorone: I think it is some carry over from previous stages|pg||
nt|dima:  Aha!|pg||
nt|doctorone: They will check the regulations for sure :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dima:  5@h seems to be atad high on these cards|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|d5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|h9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|doctorone: agreed.... But I think that N did exepect a better hand in S, and not 5 @ss|pg||
nt|doctorone: so hoping for some @ds complement|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|h4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dima:  Levy might have downgraded his spades after overcall |pg||
pc|s9|pc|hJ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|doctorone: absolutely with you Dima|pg||
nt|hedyg: or open 1@s, that should calm Yalcin|pg||
nt|dima:  Well this is a matter of system|pg||
nt|hedyg: but we shall not enter the discussion of opening 1@S or 1@c with 5 5 ..........|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|doctorone: Another way would have been to bid 3@h over 3@d, N will make an effort, and S will sign off in 4@h|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|d8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s7|nt|hedyg: after 2@s 3@H surely would be stronger than 4@H|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|doctorone: so only 3 imps instead of 14|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think he tried some kind of fast arrival with 4@H|pg||
nt|doctorone: agree Hedy, hence 2@s was...|pg||
nt|hedyg: too much!|pg||

nt|cedrict: 4@H NS looks to be the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|cedrict: voyons si sur ouvre 1@S ou 1@C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N does NOT guarantee a stopper |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it was systemic with values an no better bid|pg||
nt|cedrict: 5@H could be in danger :( :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: 4@s/unbeatable|pg||
nt|me argent: they DONT want to push these boys 2 much|pg||
nt|daman: this is going to be a cool +170 for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C East in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: yes if they awaken the sleeping giant    they may create misery|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: We do not have the datum from OR on 1st brd, but somehow (?) they made 6|pg||
nt|me argent: wold is conflicted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but since scoring is BAM EW must bid again  each board is just win/lose/draw|pg||
nt|cedrict: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: 4@h was alerted by south|pg||
nt|cedrict: first misunderstranding.... cue-bid for one.... final contract for N$|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cedrict: I dont know if they would have made 5@H..... but I know 4@S will not be a success :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if you want team rosters [and carryover at start of day]  check out bottom of http://www.acbl.org/nabc/results/2010/03/4/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: teams have decimal totals because of carryover calculated from Day 1 and Day 2  [field cut each day]|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Some specs were suggesting 1)That S might have opened 2N  or 2) over 3@s, South might haved Xed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bridgewinners site doesn't include results from last round/match of Reisinger/National Swiss prior to break|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS playing for team Rosenthal     EW  team Fleisher|pg||

nt|daman: Stansby has a shot at Player of the Year depending how he does in this event vis-a-vis Brad Moss in the North American Swiss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the board you see is the board being played as bd 4 in all the other matches;  i don't know what happened to require a substitute bd here|pg||
nt|daman: the specs tell me Stansby needs to be 8th or higher to win the PoY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 10 teams in the final|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 39 teams entered the event;  after one day reduced to 20; after yesterday reduced to 10 for the finals|pg||
nt|me argent: tough event |pg||
nt|ahollan1: National Swiss reduction even more drastic|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Probably the toughest, because of the deep cuts.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- site just showing top 10  but 36 teams in the final of the Swiss|pg||
nt|daman: well    I think we are up todate on the PoY  with the help of the specs    Stansby   Sontag   and Brogeland are the only 3 in the running     when Moss DNQ in the Reisenger he was ...|pg||
nt|daman: eliminated     I thought he could drop down to the NA Swiss    not so|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: problem may not be with convention -- but the decision to use it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: i bet Stansby would NOT open 4@D in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: a couple of minutes until rd 3|pg||
nt|daman: I always thought that you would not have an outside Ace when you tried Namyats|pg||
nt|me argent: conventions are there to be used and more importantly be abused|pg||
nt|daman: if partner had a red Ace and the @C King     it would be most unfortunate|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I think that w/Namyats, players can play it either way, the same sort of thing as in Michaels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each partnership defines which holdings are valid for Namyats|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Michaels used to be reserved for either very weak or very strong hands, but now players use it for all distributiuoonal hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think George Rosenkranz write-up was probably the most restrictive|pg||
nt|me argent: i put namyats rgt up there with playing transfers when using the weak nt|pg||
nt|me argent: well maybe not as high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I was incorrect about Board 5|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: The defense got a diamond ruff, so...|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Another win there for Rosenthal.|pg||
nt|me argent: cannot start next round until all teams finished |pg||
nt|me argent: hostage to slowest table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein went for 800 twice -- or was it 3 times |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the real problem is that players mill about and don't come to their table right away.  now 3 mins are already gone from the clock this round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told players DO get to compare with teammates between rounds -- what does panel think of this "barometer" type situation?|pg||
nt|daman: I think they got +800 and went for 800|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Kit|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :-) Hi Kit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, they are comparing after each round as of now|pg||
nt|warrens:  they provide the barometer scoring until the last few rounds|pg||

nt|hedyg: on this board only|pg||
nt|hedyg: (we hope)|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange bidding in CR, surely EW there play 2/1?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so 2@c was at the most 3+ and the 3@c bid should show 5+ cards and singleton @S?|pg||
nt|doctorone: agree.. 5@c for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: which would explain W's jump to 5@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: well, not a lot of tricks in 3NT either|pg||
nt|doctorone: that bidding directed the killing @h lead here|pg||
nt|hedyg: it should|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: though E showed @hs |pg||
nt|jzinsli: strange not to pass 2 spades|pg||
nt|doctorone: well, did show some @h stoppers for sure :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think W should have passed 2@S yes|pg||
nt|doctorone: agree|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: i can understand 5@C in CR but not 3@d here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|doctorone: or maybe should have bid 2@d over 1N, in order to bid @cs a level below?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|jzinsli: seems he was not trusting the bid of his partner ... and 2 Diamond would be better - yes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then can E pass 3@C with a maximum hand?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s9|nt|hedyg: surely that would also be a strong hand and game invite|pg||
nt|doctorone: wouldnt here, no... will try for 3N|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jzinsli: no, again 2 spades would be to pass|pg||
mc|7|nt|hedyg: so only pass over 2@s can be correct with the minimum hand in W and no fit guaranteed|pg||

mb|p|nt|warrens:  Since there is time to compare between rounds now, it's better to post the scores |pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that had to do with not all tables playing same boards simultaneously -- or maybe the shooting factor|pg||
nt|kit: as long as they don't allow it for last couple of rounds it is fine|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 5+ hearts l 4 spades|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|cedrict: they normally wend down in 3NT board 4|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: If wins ace of hearts and leads diamond, West needs to go up king and shift to club -- should fine it|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  5@C seems to be an overbid|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: But I think, as a spec just pointed out, this is a case of nerves here.|pg||
