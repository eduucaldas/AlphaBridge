nt|vugraphzyh: West is probably going to win this and play @C hoping his partner has the Q as he cant see any other way to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: He has 2 tricks in hand, only way to defeat is if partner has the @C queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: He knows declarer's shape, and he can see the pitch of the club loser coming on the KQ@D|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: N signaled with the 9@s... and gave a trick away...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that hand may get some discussion .....|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|april7: here EW might go go overboard but perhaps they will stay in a good 3NT contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the recap |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|april7: 6@C is a possible contrACT|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 6@C is a lucky contract, but not 6@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: indeed think west should pass here|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't like the 3NT rebid tbh|pg||
nt|neobas: I usually play it as solid diamonds and a bit too much to open a Gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: no W is thinking about a 6 @C contract and will have the luck to make it if he decides to do it|pg||
nt|neobas: Anyone for 3@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@C may be ok provided they could stop in 4NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 3@D is the more normal rebid...  I don't think 3NT is such an ugly choice tho|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: AH AH|pg||
nt|neobas: "My @C are more solid than your @D"|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a major cue?|pg||
nt|neobas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: now 4 @D and then 6@C perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|chick: Signaling Rule  2:  Never signal with a trick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now e/w should get to 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: and   1 is?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: must avoid 6NT|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C can be beaten on a @H lead as long as when the Q@S is run on the first round of the suit South ducks|pg||
nt|april7: W should ofcourse pull trumps before giving up a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be tough i think|pg||
nt|april7: 6NT possible except on @H lead,but S will lead @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry, stupid of me, diamonds don't need to be set up in clubs|pg||
nt|chick: Signaling Rule  1:  Every card is a signal (whether you mean it or not)|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h3|pg||

nt|patricck: If North's 2@S said he didn't like spades much then South bought a very lucky hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: when S hear about the cuebid in @d he can take off|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: He thinks how to handle to auction in order to get to grand|pg||
nt|jstokes: nice to hold that south hand and hear partner 1) open the bidding and 2) raise hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but a 5@c bid now will kill the N hand|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|peachy: S will take control in some manner|pg||
nt|yuval10: and only raise but raise it in a "positive" fashion, as 3@h is of course better than 4@h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yuval10: *not |pg||
nt|hedyg: they must play unserious 3NT and serious cuebids?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyh: Not sure why north failed to bid 4@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Maybe he didnt like his partner's shortness in @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: holding AK@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: is 3@H better  or does it lack 1 more @H for the 4@H bid?|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h is better|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: what shortness Ron? was 4@c alerted as short?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: In my view, below game level u have to show what u have, so not bidding 4@D makes the bid just too complicated|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: no Hedy just cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: but north holds AK@C so he knows his partner is short|pg||
nt|hedyg: okok, but in that case he denied A@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|yuval10: NOW he can takeoff|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe 5NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|nt|yuval10: maybe he doesn't even bother that :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyh: He has 7@H's|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: doesnt really care for Q@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @H lead?|pg||
nt|yuval10: yeah i guess you can hardly find any hands with a @d cue that bided 3@h and 7 won't be excellent against|pg||
nt|peachy: play should not take long|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: No, Bar in West asks himself what are the chances they miss an Ace with this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: My guess is he will lead @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: S refused to ask keycards, must be void somewhere|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ron is 4@s cue or rkc?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Meanwhile... Israeli Bridge Festival www.ibf-festival.org|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 4@c could be a singleton i do not understand why N didnt show A@C over 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: North denied |pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: North denied @D cue earlier, wanted to show something|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he did|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: but he never cuebid @c either!|pg||
nt|jstokes: were any of these juniors representing Israel at the world championships in Philadelphia, where Israel's juniors were very impressive?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he sits there with AK@C and never shows |pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: He probably guessed from south bid that he is void for not asking keycards|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm "guessed"|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Joe|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, both South nad West played on the winning team|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: He sent me a note saying "alon is club void right"? and I confirmed (after the bidding was over of course) :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but they all seem to have changed partners since then|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: So he has a good nose|pg||
