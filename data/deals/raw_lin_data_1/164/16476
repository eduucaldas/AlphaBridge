nt|Walddk4: http://www.brenning.se/results/2011/london/tgrs2ndauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub2ndauctionpairs-session1.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 34 tables in play, so waiting will be part of the game|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would estimate 70-80% of the field will open 4@h so those Easts who can hold it do down one will probably get a decent score.|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not much wrong with 1@H from where I sit|pg||

nt|sybarra: agree or @H's |pg||
nt|andyv:  this may score well for NS as they can't make 5 of a minor and it seems reasonable the E will bid on to 4@s in most situations|pg||

nt|mrt2000: should be a flat(ish) board |pg||
nt|andyv:  those NS who can buy this for 4@d will do very well|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S is playing 5@d, would a dbl by E request a @d lead?|pg||
