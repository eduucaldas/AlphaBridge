nt|bridge_one: Hello Slawek :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphp2: sorry for problems, Kalita played 7 of spade the result is -3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, lead a card and claim|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Serhat Ozenir|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree with pass by West - the DBL means only points, for sure not long @h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C would be forced|pg||

nt|vbman: so 1 nt is weak?|pg||

nt|Gerben42: this contract is much safer|pg||
nt|vbman: or 15-17?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14 balanced hands are opened 1@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like this 3@S bid with this flat hand and a known 8 card fit only|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|serhat: hi All|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  N knows partner has maximum hand with @h|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: west will need to decide what ace partner has|pg||
nt|vbman: and the rebid after 1 red suit is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: passed hoping in 2 @s tricks - difficult to think North void in @S !|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 12-14 they start a "rescue" sequence and try to find a ceah major fit before 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: only nuclear weapon against this transfers:)|pg||
nt|tez: hi Danny welcome:)|pg||

nt|jcmax: Good morning everyone!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|serhat: hi Sabina|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: But you bid a major over 1@D (0-7) if you have 12-14. Can be 3 cards|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|nagini: on this level they rarely bid without a reason|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is not natural. it may include "any 0-6 hand"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  next time it does no harm, but now E has the lead as described in a bridge book|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||

pc|s3|nt|nagini: mostly playing against them askin for drink:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: neither 1@C nor 1@D must be alerted in poland|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like a strip hand...but since clubs behave, no problems whatsoever|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s was not enough|pg||
nt|3for3: if the jack didnt fall, declarer would be able to trump 4th club, and perhaps throw in the opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: nie ma sensu raczej|pg||
nt|serhat: -3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In theory, this is a good save (only 500) but it matters little when their team-mates were pushed to 5@H at the other table|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nigel_k:  This one looks like it was lucky to escape undoubled|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with seven @C the pass at 3@H is dangerous - in this sequence 4@C can be a strong hand, but only long suit - and with K@S sgl can pass at 4@S ...|pg||

nt|nagini: hard to stop before 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: most of the teams we see this weekend are from Warsaw|pg||
nt|vbman: so how long does it last and how many times is it held in a year?|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tomi2: in 3 N went directly to the major game not trying for 3NT and in 2 they tried to invite balanced instead of going towards a @D contract|pg||

nt|bridge_one: for bridge players it is important to have good gadgets after 1ANY pass pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H after dbl 17+|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3NT very much looks like fast arrival to me, meaning partner I have a really bad hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-6(7)  and 1@H therefore 8+, but maybe only 7+ for them|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  3NT needs partner to have something in hearts, but making 11 tricks in diamonds needs a lot more|pg||

nt|tez: i would bid 3@c with west hand..you?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Right. Another issue is, what dio we lead from J108x  J107x  J10xx. I think the concensus is Jack from the first one, low from the other holdings. Any views, Sabine?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello everyone!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duking the D risk Q@D @d ruff losing after the K@D|pg||
nt|vbman: taking the low road resulted well|pg||
nt|vbman: if they played in nt it wd be a 15 point difference|pg||
nt|vbman: operator what are ns talking now?|pg||
nt|tez: if pikus discard @d..down 3|pg||
nt|jcmax: It really depends. If you have reasons to assume there is at most a doubleton in dummy then a low one clearly would be best even from the first holding.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's say declarer has Qx in dummy and A9xx in his hand. he will almost certainly put up the Q.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nagini: felt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: my asistant says ''we say "side suit first" :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most of the breaks will be because most Polish players smoke - so they need a short time in such 12 board matches|pg||
nt|serhat: nice 7h here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tomi2: even if he went down it would gain lots of imps since NS made 4@S over there|pg||
nt|pfbr: "assistant" :)|pg||
nt|nagini: personally I would choose  pepsi a pd|pg||
nt|vbman: smoking kills|pg||
nt|tomi2: this hand is easy in polish club, you open 1@C and start counting your points. For EW here 1@C is a limited opening, so Jagniewski had to guess or count his points first before ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: in vuln normal 3@h opening|pg||
nt|nagini: one condition only: as my sponsor:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: light openung|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|tomi2: the best movement for the players was "4-board BAM swiss" so they had to wait for the other results and couls smore every 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: players was talking about previous board|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think with wests hand you should not force your partnership to the 5th level if you start the match leading in the 25 VP margin|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: pepsi has a feeling in fingers:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad controls isnt worth 12|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but I by today's standards, it's pretty sound -- a couple of 10's, and a couple of honor tricks make up for the acelessness.|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, if you can get them to take a phantom save, vul, it does have its merits.|pg||
nt|tomi2: you already need a good dummy to cause s relative flat score compared to passing 4@H with those two major aces|pg||
nt|jcmax: Shall we predict they will bid 7N?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Gerben42: good correction to 5@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if partner cannot open 2@S, probably the suit is insufficient|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@D of course is multi - long @h or @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: if 4@H was making you need to escape for -3 maximum to have a relatively flat board|pg||
nt|tomi2: while you need a huge dummy to turn a bad baord into a good one - but this will not bring you more VP tan you already have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is an artificial game-force|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|tomi2: but it riscs going down more or going down while 4@H was not making - in those scenarios you lose imps. so IMO bidding can win very seldom but lose very often|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: the players don't know the running score but they know the score after 12 boards|pg||
nt|serhat: I dont think so..|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|othered1: Effective double by north.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be worried about @C now|pg||
nt|othered1: He can hold this to -1 with the right view on the minor suit positions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but might take a wrong view on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is to give the A in @D - cab be usefull for the lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0549.JPG North|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry wrong link, this was south|pg||
nt|jcmax: Especially in an undisturbed relay auction. That's what it looks like anyway.|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0550.JPG this is north|pg||
nt|jcmax: When the opponents play relays I strongly feel with a hand like N's one should get involved in the bidding especially at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kwiecien asking, Jagniewski telling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would get in with 2@D?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|tomi2: and they already had one board where they might expect to win imps and one where they might lose, wo it was not unlikely that the result was still 25-x at that point|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0569.JPG east|pg||
nt|3for3: df wanted declarer to run the 9 of @C through south.  It plays well :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: They certainly know their system, so the best chance you have is make some noise.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even 3 maybe?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0542.JPG west|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|jcmax: I'd prefer 3@D personally|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: north needed to stay off hearts until south lead them.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, because 2@D will not hurt their relays|pg||
mb|7N|nt|othered1: Agree.  I wonder if the lead will give him an idea of the shape of the hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And then it makes no sense|pg||
nt|serhat: wow|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@D doesn't really disturb that much and the relays may still be on. But after 3@D it will be back to natural and good judgment.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|egezzer: Hi everyone |pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||

mb|p|nt|pfbr: Morning, Roland@h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NS must take their 5 tricks now|pg||

nt|3for3: they needed better signalling between the first heart and the club played, as to whether the ten was falling |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Kwiecien can claim before the lead :)|pg||
mc|13|nt|tomi2: I guess this was a puppet stayman sequence, 3@C asked for majors, 3@D= at least one 4 card major, 3@H=spades 3@S=fit 3NT is forcing then showing interest in slam|pg||

nt|Gerben42: the real question is did North have to back in after 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very good evaluation by West|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then you need enough entries for making this finese and later taking advantage of the @C trick. this way he sould not cash and finesse because @D back would kill the 4th club ...|pg||

nt|tomi2: 6@H i mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hej Anita @H|pg||
nt|3for3: the danger of bidding 2@S is you are setting up partner to save in 4@S, when your hand has lots of defensive potential|pg||
nt|jcmax: Wow! i am wondering why N bid 2@D here instead of a straightforward 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whereas a suit response can be 0|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3N definitely looks like the contract he wants to play.|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@D apparently in their methods is forcing, but where does it lead?|pg||
nt|serhat: He might be thinking leading a H!?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcmax: Can slam really be on? and if the answer to that is no, then a bid like 2@D on another day may give away too much information to the opponents.|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|tomi2: Russian coul have ducked the heart to cut the communication here|pg||
nt|vbman: yessss|pg||
nt|tomi2: hoping N will finesse again, then Vainikonis would have to do something in @D to get an entry for the spade finesse|pg||
nt|vbman: he can still go wrong easily|pg||
nt|tomi2: but if he had to cross in @D he could have finessed first, then west could win the queen, cross to partners @DA and get a ruff|pg||

mb|2D|nt|Gerben42: when @HK wins your problem is gone: @DA draw @H and run @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D MULTI (6 cards in one major)|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt look like it will be too difficult to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And these guys know the percentage play in spades, cashing the ace first|pg||
nt|serhat: I guess they will bid 4h|pg||
mb|d|nt|nagini: NS play Mozart im mjrs:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s @s and minor weak hand i think|pg||
nt|nagini: minimulti 6 + mjr|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends how many hearts Kalida bids next, 2 or 3|pg||
nt|serhat: 4h now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: @HA @HQ even better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which would be wrong at matchpoints|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: you have all intermediates|pg||
nt|jcmax: Transfer bids over 1@C openings are becoming increasingly popular.|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h MEANS Ý HAVE 1s2S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ralfwil: 33 points on EW but no slam as far as I can see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably rdbl have another means (not A @D)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: N's 2@S response doesn't promise anything extra, it just confirms the possession of 4 cards in @S|pg||
nt|tez: @s's i mean|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D =shortness..|pg||
nt|jcmax: Against 4@H EW can get a @D ruff, but only at the expense of a natural trump trick. Declarer however may misguess trumps and then 4@H could go down|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ralfwil: but made in CR|pg||
nt|tomi2: again some "Hamman" 3NT try, this time stopped by west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
nt|nagini: classic polish bluff|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: wow|pg||
nt|jcmax: without key card Blackwood, one might get to a grand slam here :)|pg||
nt|serhat: I think Kalida is taking easy as not Vul|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's say E had bid a preeemptive 3@D instead of 2@D (if available), then declarer may very well decide to play a @H to the K.|pg||
nt|serhat: he has to bid 4h now|pg||
nt|serhat: cant let 3nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Russyan did enough by doubling and bidding 2NT. I would have passed 3@H I must confess|pg||
nt|serhat: to be honest I am surprised he didnt bid 4h over 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: as smart as pepsi?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
nt|vbman: push board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: am quite suprised that Russian did not bid 2@D after 1@S - that is a GF relay promising at least 3 card support in @S and enough for game|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: At IMPs you will play as safely as possible to make your contract, hence @SA is correct play|pg||
nt|tez: he didnt show void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at matchpoints, however, you must try to make as many tricks as possible, so finessing the queen is the right play|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, surprising, since partner's ace of @D could have been the K@S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
nt|tomi2: skipping the 2@D relay often indicates a) not such good 3 card support and/or b) a better heart suit|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this to give the possibility to defend knowing a minimum of 3 cards |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rest assured that Jagniewski will cash @SA at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is a very poor contract|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|tez: is it real or need undo|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: at first trick W small dimond and E 8 od dimond|pg||
nt|tez: i thk he won from dummy and played @d to ace|pg||
nt|jcmax: I don't think N's action is clear at all here. give partner Jxxx, Q, Axxxx, KJx and he definitely should pass 3N!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Gerben42: Peplonski insisted on @H then RKC, 3, thanks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcmax: So roland at matchpoints, if the Q loses to the K, what is the correct play in the 2nd round of the suit?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|Gerben42: Notus comeback|pg||
nt|Gerben42: must have been misunderstanding in closed room |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he had that hand, Sabine, he might have raised 3@H|pg||
nt|jcmax: And certainly that hand would be more consistent with his bidding than his actual one!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After all his partner bid them three times|pg||

nt|ralfwil: -2??|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Don't really understand that line at all|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: first trick and the two last|pg||
nt|tomi2: could it cost to unblock @CA in between? even if it does not bring you a trick it can work as a vienna coup|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Niegel. Play @cA first and see what happens|pg||
nt|Gerben42: tough hands this set|pg||
nt|egezzer: sure. I agree with you|pg||
nt|tomi2: is there some reason why west could not have the last spade honor and a high club now? I dont see|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: Kowalski played the hearts low-hig and discarded a small @D. maybe north took this as "encouraging"|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: and welcome to Frank Budai|pg||

mb|d|nt|frankaus: g'day all - no cricket digs pls|pg||

mb|r|nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|tomi2: but with @D ace he could affort to discard some club, even the queen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT ?!|pg||
nt|jcmax: Interesting to see whether EW will bid all the way up to 3NT here.|pg||
nt|nagini: hello|pg||
nt|jcmax: Or maybe they will just end up doubling their opponents?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  Deep Finess will insist of grand slam here|pg||

mb|2C|nt|tez: are they playing with screen?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Olech's overcall was very light|pg||
nt|3for3: not sure i love 3@S overcall.  May push the opps to 4@H which they may not have reached on their own steam|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If you play diamonds first and they break you now have 11 tricks and can play for a squeeze|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = max 3 cards support|pg||
nt|tomi2: Kowalski ince again found the killing lead|pg||
nt|vbman: no  h lead then margin is very wide|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: very aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: running J@s was ok play but before cashing A@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are going to take the money|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would not want to be in 3NT anyway|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  real view wll lead to @s game|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: No-one can double so he will get away with it|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Low from a doubleton in Poland|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently 1NT was forcing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@H is the normal contract|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny looking auction, but it was systemic and got to the normal spot.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT was strong bal. 2@D = transfer to @H 2NT superaccept :)|pg||

nt|po-s: Does East know what is trumps?|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|tomi2: since they are GF now 3@D shows some interest, north has two aces, maye he will try for slam|pg||
nt|nagini: imagine|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tomi2: if south had a better @H stopper and not such great fit, he would bid 3nt over 3@C directly|pg||
nt|tez: ty Monika|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so 420|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer may not read the lead as short, but it shouldn't matter as cards lie|pg||
nt|jcmax: It's not clear to me what the correct action with the N is. 4-card support for partner and relative shortness in @S seem to call for action.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: then South will also score his @H10|pg||
nt|jcmax: Bidding 1NT with the N hand ahead of partner seems rushing things a bit. He was really asking to get doubled!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|po-s: what if South doesn´t have the club king?|pg||
nt|nagini: claim 7|pg||
nt|othered1: or do thy lead rusinow?|pg||

pc|cA|nt|jcmax: Partner may have problems reopening|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Oh well, he gets a small heart anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can score @H10 as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: small spade to the king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to do it first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Small spade, club|pg||
nt|po-s: aha, west thinks 3D is splinter...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Gerben42: still ruffing their own trick|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|3for3: and you are a passed hand, so partner won't move over that very often|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: and Koto can overruff |pg||

nt|frankaus: hard to do without peeking|pg||
nt|jcmax: But there really are not many hcp's|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pg||

nt|tomi2: Let me try to introduce the format they are playing here. This is the Polish Premiere League. 16 Teams play a compleate round robin on thwo weekends, so they will finish sunday but ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: then the "fun" will start. The field will be torn into groups of 4 - basicly its most important to be top 8 after sunday|pg||

mb|3S|nt|tez: but we are sure he will lead @d ace or @s ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: normal lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a kinitz told me 2NT is GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 2@C would be nmf. I guess they play some GF checkback or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: then the teams will play one "K-O" against teams from their group, the first 8 may still become Champions, the last 8 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
nt|tomi2: south just shows a balanced hand with 6 clubs and probably 3@S and not a good heart stop. interesting what north makes with those information havin 2 hearts only too|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 3@H = invite, 2Nt=GF both with raise in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a interesting option|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tomi2: playing this method south was not able to show a good/bad hand. he has 3 kings and one ace, but could have had some queens and jacks|pg||
nt|tomi2: and since he opened 1nt on AKAK last hand he cant have more than this|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|po-s: interesting choice by South to bid game with what loks like a lot of worthless black cards and bad trumps, the DQ as the only plus value - but lucky|pg||
nt|po-s: 3rd hand openings don´t deny an opening...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK; then they missed a trick|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am sure there are a number of players who would just have blasted 3NT on the N cards.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could you correct the score in MOVIE, Monia please?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Monika|pg||
pc|dK|nt|trotto:  2@d = ask , 2nt 6 clubs , 3 @d relay ,  3@s= 3226 = , 4 @d - end signal( call P for bid 4 @h) 4 @s  = game @s sign off|pg||
nt|trotto:  tuszynski after  3 @s  bid knew about risky  to play  3 N    doubletons @h mirror|pg||
nt|nagini: i would prefer yo play longest suits... but whathever yuo wish sir:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me know if you need the code|pg||
nt|jcmax: It looks like 8 tricks on top and where there is 8 there is 9 they say. Not on this hand though.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2CSX-2|pg||
nt|serhat: I think I would bid 3nt over 1h|pg||
nt|jcmax: If N had Axx in @S instead he could hold up twice in @S and make 3N. So mental note Axx is always better than Ax when cosidering bidding 3N :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tomi2: so this sequence must show mild slam interest from partner and south could go on imo|pg||
nt|nagini: would prefer 3 nt |pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2: i think he showed a weaker hand than he has with the 2@H bid. I guess he had some constructive raise available.|pg||
nt|3for3: 4 trick swing on the lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|frankaus: A & K get better evaluated - Q,s down graded|pg||
nt|serhat: I dont think Axx is or Ax is matter on this hand Sabina. we dont know anything about H's! do we? it is just tactical bid!|pg||
nt|serhat: it might end succesful|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nagini: 6 sp 1430|pg||
nt|jcmax: No it's not a matter, only the difference between being able to make 3N or not.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tez: now need to play @s ..from hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: An ace is definitely worth more than 4, and the jack is not worth 1|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  friendly lead, but declarer has a lot of work anyway|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nagini: 6 cl 1370 only:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: my opps often cash two aces when i play 6@S without them, and woth no fit and no @SQ|pg||
nt|nagini: Apek does know his work:)|pg||
nt|nagini: tuszek wake up:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  when defence would have started with A @h and @h, declarer would be in trouble|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tomi2: teams, who finished higher in the RR have some carry over, and most important, the top teams may affort to lose one match in beteween|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in Italy use 2Nt = 3 cards limit+ and 3@H =4 cards limit+|pg||
nt|nagini: nice Marcin|pg||
nt|serhat: exactly we might consider 4d bid over dbl!?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|tomi2: he has a huge hand for this bidding. His partner was not counting on THIS when he balanced vulnerable|pg||

nt|frankaus: a lot of points in this deck|pg||
nt|nagini: i'm trembling when Tuszek is playing always:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a expert told me that 2Nt in the previous hand int's GF - i suppose it is NoGF, because need to have a bid to invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: they did :)|pg||
nt|serhat: C looks good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I lead @C4, but my leads are known to be terrible|pg||

pc|h2|nt|nagini: see?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: easy:)|pg||
nt|serhat: to be honest I would not. :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nigel_k:  Need to find a tenth trick though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S must be careful in this contract|pg||
nt|nagini: then wht to win?:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A low heart from North works because you hold heart losers to one and can still ruff two diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But that is looking at all four hands of course|pg||
nt|tez: pls lead partners suit:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: close to open this , i wouldnt but I am a big non-fan of QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|po-s: It looks like they abandoned old Polish club and play transfers over 1club openings|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes and they dont open 1@C on very stong hands, so this 2nt becomes free for some conventional meaning|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Now he made up for it, but .....|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|frankaus: @DQ and @C KQ ill not be such gr8 assets|pg||

nt|nagini: Apek will do ... technics:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: a kib points out, that we are playing only black suits here all the time. What happend to good old hearts and diamonds? :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 18-20 he would rebid 1NT, with a weak NT hand 1@H|pg||
nt|po-s: Then 2NT might show either or.... or perhaps just clubs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nagini: think he is too:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so I'm with Klimacki |pg||
nt|Gerben42: p 1m 4@H sounds perfect :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I do not lead from a doubleton when my partner has not bid the suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spades that is|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nigel_k:  Since West has short diamonds there is a serious risk of going down with trumps 2-2 if you don't play them immediately|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Warren :)|pg||
nt|juror1: welcome Warren again :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4nt rkbw|pg||

nt|tomi2: it is Dariusz Kowalski|pg||
nt|nagini: wow|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bridge_one: many bid 5@S = no Q, 5Nt = Q, 6@C = Q + 1K etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And diamonds are out of course|pg||
nt|jcmax: This is not the best defence. s would have done better to shift tio a @C|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When declarer follows with the queen, the jack is a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now seven with K in @h|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer may not have enough communication though to "misguess" the trump suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nigel_k:  Good defence to continue trumps|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree with declarers line though it didn't work - this is usually the case only when I am declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like as S should have played a @s in trick2|pg||
nt|warrens:  trying for 7, but I don't think he'll make 6 |pg||
nt|po-s: if 3H showed spade values why did he ignore his heart values?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tez: we will see endplay soon|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Gerben42: maybe with good intermediates I would open it anyway - depends on mood |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, hard also 6|pg||
nt|tomi2: whatever their bids mean, they play a good contract rightsided now. he has one discard on @H at least and one on spades, so it does not need @D finesse. and with this lead he even ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: survives 4-0 trumps|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: So a club or heart. Everything could cost a trick|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Second half at 11.00 CET, in 35 minutes|pg||
mb|r|nt|tomi2: 2@D might be a transfer to hearts, showing some at least mild invitational hand. playing this method 2@H becomes "GF in @D". quite popular in the Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: better idea|pg||
nt|jcmax: W redoubles no doubt to show the @DA. That will make it easy for E to bid 3NT|pg||

nt|nagini: = just made|pg||
nt|trotto: because kibs are still asking for Kowaski-Tuszynski's system, I'll explain: after several relays when the distribution is known, 3nt is to play, 4@d is artificial, forcing to ...|pg||
nt|trotto: mandatory 4@h (and then pass on any bid of P) , while 4@c/4@h/4@s / 4nt are preferential blackwoods|pg||
nt|tez: other table bid 3 nt..brave @h|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is a very good idea to discuss with your partner your methods after the opponents double a cuebid. With proper agreements the opponents double can make it even easier to get to ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: the correct spot.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: passing a easy 3Nt (lead @H...)|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: it seems to be usefull as long as you dont forget about this too often, because then its quite expensive :)|pg||

nt|trotto: e.g. if the opener has distrubution like 3-3-1-6 and the last answer to relay was 3@h, then 3@s = rkcb on @c fixed (because @c are the longest) 3nt to play, 4@c - rkcb on @s fixed ...|pg||

pc|d9|nt|warrens:  but I think declarer will get endplayed in dummy at the end and be forced to give a trump promotion.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally 2 trick in the trump, and after all the goood cards - when opps ruff remain with one trump - now you play last trump and make the rest of tricks|pg||
