nt|Walddk2: I have 12-14 balanced, I even have a club stopper. What's wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: at least he didn't rebid 2@H I mean - Pigot's idea is that the worse your hand, the lower you rebid, to keep it low|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 15 and 16 first in this room, followed by comparisons from the closed room when we circle back to board 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Modern tendency by many players is to open 1@S on West's cards, using Bergen's Rule of 20 or whatever evaluation method one uses. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Walker supports they are in game I suspect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and on their way down|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@H would be constructive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many play that as 8(9)-11|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h is an OK contract but fails - 3NT is not hopeless|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Do you also rebid 2NT with the N cards, Peter? Or do you bid 2/3@C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|petergill: I think I would rebid 2NT = Ax can be rightsided opposite say J10x in dummy. and you?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2NT also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I don't think 2@C is silly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think I will force to game with 3@C|pg||
nt|petergill: But over 2NT, I think I would either rebid 3NT or Pass 2NT. 10 tricks is a lot to make opposite no honours in South's hand in either five card suit - so I think i would try for 9 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: tricks. |pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
nt|petergill: At imps, 3NT is often best - the "400 loses to 420" factor of matchpoint bridge is almost irrelevant at imps. |pg||
nt|petergill: I like 2Nt, because 2@C might be passed with 3NT on, and because I'm caught between 2@C and 3@C in strength (@H10 makes my hand a bit strong for 2@C maybe), and because 2NT tells ...|pg||
