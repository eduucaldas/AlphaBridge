nt|vugraphzxn: Sundar, as always, taking his time|pg||
nt|praba: S shift, and if W puts in the 9, can escape for 1 down|pg||
nt|mohitz:  spade to Queen and low club works|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: .. which is a good thing to do more often than not|pg||

nt|rodal f: Than ure back at 4@C if needed|pg||

nt|othered1: Who can bid 4@D?|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|panja: and NS in CR...Keyzad and Sunit played together for years b4 2003 or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: yes... with a plan to bid 2@D if E bid 2@C.. but 2@S put a spanner in the works|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: cant blame E for bidding 3@C|pg||
nt|praba: Surely partner has 5-5 for 3C. Is it ok to still try for a D fit?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bid 1NT direct=8-10HP insteed of cheet ure pard later|pg||
nt|panja: not I guess..|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: Sundar has his eyes closed - wondering what sort of a hand Sridhar has|pg||
nt|panja: I thought N should have redoubled after 1@S dbl..he is almost at a maximum for 1@S takeout|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: @CKQ are good cards when p has bid @Cs twice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxn: i guess @DT is more than what he promised|pg||

nt|mohitz:  i will use my 500 Rs note and ask for a revoke|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: get opps to revoke somehow|pg||
nt|panja: you cannot make unless E decides to throw his @SQ too early..in which case there would be a black suit squeeze on W after 1 Club ruff...|pg||
nt|panja: and E will do nothing of the kind..so no hopes for 13 tricks, really|pg||
nt|mohitz:  had been a dream set for Poddar|pg||
nt|mohitz:  before this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: ew play suction.. so 1@C-1@S e.g. would be either @Cs or @Ds and @Hs|pg||
nt|rodal f: If S anwered at N by the @DQ he might would ben easyer to stop. BUT DID N need to check it after the bids?|pg||
nt|praba: finally, some pickup for TA|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: agree.... if S had an extra K, he cud be a @D or 2 less|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit so and so for me. Answers come up wrong antway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: if 1N-x promised a desire to penalise, 3@D has already shown long @Ds though|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: anyway|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|panja: his only hope is @SKQJ with W...but with that, W would have led @SK, not @CQ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: yes... W cant be @H KQJ by same logic|pg||
nt|vugraphzxn: i think best to play these hands fast as declarer|pg||

pc|d5|pc|h2|pc|dJ|pc|h3|pg||
