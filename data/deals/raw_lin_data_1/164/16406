mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@C still stayman over the double (?)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Over a double, you can play 'system on' or 'system off'. So, 2@C can be either Stayman or natural.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|dburn: too late to shift to diamonds now - maybe he had to lead one|pg||
nt|brolucius: The queen signal advertises Q-J and invites an underlead at T2.|pg||
nt|dburn: but I don't think that works either, as long as declarer rejects the heart finesse|pg||

nt|brolucius: 3@D is not explained on the C-card. 2@D and the other two-level responses would have been transfers.|pg||
nt|rmb1: If 3@D has shown a double @D stop it has made for an easy auction for NS|pg||
nt|brolucius: West may find the spade lead if 3@D showed something good in that suit.|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@D was fit (I am told)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|brolucius: The king lead is aimed at protecting a spade entry to the East hand, where he hopes to find length. It has not worked well here, saving declarer a guess.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: OK; done|pg||
nt|paulg:  we have seen a lot of two-suiters tonight, perhaps the theme of the weekend|pg||

nt|garnetts: well played :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT for EW here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
nt|paulg:  the play on 19 would have been uninteresting, we can live without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: figured as much :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|1S|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes and about as difficult to make as the last one |pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: double explained as promising 3 @Hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: seems a simpel 1 off, anyone see anything lese?|pg||
nt|justin c: too early for difficult contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Give us Man Utd|pg||
nt|bt: what are the chances of that roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Non-existent|pg||
nt|bt: seems board 23-24 are slightly favorable for skara|pg||
nt|bt: well skara is winning here so|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chessmaste: Looks like the same ten tricks too|pg||
pc|h2|nt|diana1: very hard for Vi to imagine that Charles has also 3 losing @hs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|bt: the natural play works|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|diana1: so early on in the match she is probably going for what she thinks is the safest thing|pg||
nt|paulg:  all the reasons are there to make North declarer on this hand, but it just did not work here|pg||

nt|greerm: but when dbl promises 3H, then he had a different decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|sheila a: This is the slight downside to the Multi, in that it's easier for E to come in over 2@d than 2@s|pg||

nt|chessmaste: 4@S is possible|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  i don't think they can, but a few concerns for declarer|pg||

nt|justin c: helping declarer to finesse the @H10 later|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|garnetts: maybe that is a better idea than helping partner--|pg||

pc|c2|nt|bt: people usually dont work much on 1X-(1N)-?? in their system, pretty common auction|pg||

nt|diablo666: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hi Roger - do u know where find the CC of players ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxd: N-S is playing 1@C 16+, 1@D natural, 5c M, 2@D multi, 2M = 10-13 6+|pg||
nt|greerm: 3NT by NS now|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Another easy game here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would be pretty annoyed giving away 150 for no reason |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|diablo666: Nope, sry. Staffan will check it out...|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c shows diamonds, or a 5-card major with 4-card minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  they have been very solid since the accident on  22, probably give them confidence for the rest of the weekend|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: not the world's best 4 card minor|pg||
nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  there could be blood if East doubles|pg||
nt|sheila a: Lindsay may be wondering if partner has @s|pg||
nt|garnetts: If I had been west it would have been 400 |pg||
mb|1D|nt|greerm: or 4@H maybe|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: ty staffan|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  wow, that is a big pass by East|pg||
nt|sheila a: I guess most would play x as pass or correct by E in this situation?|pg||
nt|diana1: it really is - has to do something|pg||
mb|d|nt|greerm: 2NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: takeout double here, will lead to 4@H by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: good barrage by NS |pg||
nt|garnetts: well does east absolutely promise four hearts?  I think not |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|greerm: that might deny 2@H in which case N will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes in these auctions someone just has to bid notrump even with Jxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: many pair use the open of 4@C, in first and second position, with long suit in ! closed and A or K out - here the advantage to play natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: i meant bid 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: same hand a heart less and spade more--what would you do?  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  this is unlikely to take long|pg||
nt|justin c: @h can still be right in 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good point - double cannot guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: with short @H hand taking the @S force|pg||
nt|justin c: agreed, X covers a lot of ground|pg||

pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: long suit in @H|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: note the force of intermediate cards in the trump suit|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|diana1: double is probably the best thing as he is happy enough if his partner passes or bids spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might not make either --needs accurate play |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  given the carnage that may ensue, this is probably the safest spot for EW|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The 4-1 heart break is a blow for declarer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He must now change tack |pg||
pc|d8|nt|sheila a: maybe he was worried that he had insufficient defence if partner was quite weak??|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: that will mean he gets the @D length right though--so a @D to the K --simply play the k@D first then lead towards  the ace |pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  except opponents are already limited, so can easily be your hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is on track now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Liggins can ruff or not as won't matter now --Mortons Fork |pg||

mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt i suppose raise with 4 cards, but can be weaker that Jacoby 2Nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: This should be more straightforward|pg||
nt|paulg:  a quieter hand as everything behaves|pg||
nt|diana1: looks like an easy enough 4@hs especially as the @ds are breaking|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|justin c: nothing v appealing for W to do|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: Just out of curiosity waht would an initial 3@S show?  |pg||
pc|s5|nt|justin c: presumably a stronger hand than this|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|diablo666: West showing extra values with no short suit, a bid that shows a positive attitude towards life :) .|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only 1 key cards in East, perhaps better 4@S over 3@D (but i don't know what means 3@D, could be conventional bid)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I am not sure a simple 2@S is right on the East hand - maybe 3@S - unless they think that is weak|pg||
nt|garnetts: or weaker?  |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|greerm: standard lead with 5 trumps |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with Mark here--I like 3@S to be this hand type--no point in pre-empting with 3@S |pg||
nt|justin c: i dont know the EW bidding methods here|pg||
nt|justin c: but i think that 3@S would be a strong 1 suiter|pg||
nt|justin c: question is whether this is 'strong'|pg||
nt|justin c: it is if your p promises to produce the @SK and an A|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The other question you need to ask is if I bid 2@S will partner pass on many hands where we have a play for game?|pg||
nt|justin c: y, was wondering what, if anything, West would do if S had passed|pg||
nt|justin c: of the first 7 boards, 6 were flat|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: 3@D 14/15 no shortness (this inf., by kibitz, so TY :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yup--that is why I do not like 2@S |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Whenever West has modest spades he will be likley to pass, even with decent high card strength.|pg||
nt|garnetts: There was a case for a penalty double of 3@H --but usually you cannot do that as west |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chessmaste: That is why I would be inclined to overcall 3@S - then partner does not have to worry so much about trump support|pg||

nt|justin c: (available from all good bookshops :) )|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: South has a fine multi--North does not--an offensive weapon should not have two cast iron defensive tricks --and also the three cards in spades is an issue |pg||

nt|garnetts: west might not lead a heart--but he shoudl because he has nothing else much |pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  and the fortunate diamond position|pg||

nt|garnetts: I think it was a well deserved swing then |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|paulg:  solid opener from Vi Outred that shows a limited hand with either clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for NI in the Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: are you thinking of 1@d, Paul?|pg||
nt|paulg:  oh, she's decided it is 11-13 balanced ... which of course it is|pg||
nt|diana1: 3NT was missed in the other room with NS playing in 3@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think Matheson and Sime will bid the slam|pg||
nt|toobad: it would be a stretch |pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  even more solid then|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@S anyone?|pg||
nt|paulg:  3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|toobad: fit jump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@s showing a 3-card limit raise is very popular with the 5-card majorites here|pg||
nt|garnetts: we do try to argue for leads we really would make and not just those that work when we can see all of the hands |pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  very hard to bid 3NT when the opposition show hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: is everybody playing transfers?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|greerm: 13 imps to NI|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  the double showed 12-14 balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sheila a: the auction does kind of suggest @h are 4-4|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless 1@d was a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: 1@d might have been a sort of responsive double|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, or just denying a 5-card major?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Vi wondering if there are 9 on top|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd be wondering if there are 7 on top|pg||
nt|sheila a: Charles has bid quite strongly but clearly there were other, stronger bids he could have made|pg||
nt|diana1: as you said before Paul it is easy when we can see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  if there is one leading style I abhor, then it is MUD in partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: @S leads here?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  a lot depends on what the redouble showed .. it may have been diamonds or a range|pg||
nt|garnetts: that double is far too agressive in my view although it might work |pg||
pc|s4|nt|toobad: me too....here here!!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sheila a: I was going more by the fact that he came again at the 3 level vul|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||

pc|d6|nt|garnetts: do they lead low from xx?  so whay not play low from J9xx|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c4|nt|chessmaste: That was poor defence by South - simply go in with a diamond and play another spade|pg||
nt|justin c: i think S needed to grab the first trump and play another @S|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||

nt|garnetts: well I do anyway |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|justin c: seems a bit unlikely to play declarer for 5 or 6 small @D here|pg||
nt|garnetts: true|pg||
nt|garnetts: well six small maybe |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to admit I would have passed with Qxxxx too|pg||
nt|justin c: me too|pg||
mc|7|nt|justin c: looks like a big downside, and little upside|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: unless Shields is of the Kokish School of Unlimited Overcalls and bids 2@h|pg||
nt|dburn: but he is far too sensible a fellow to do that|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  my rule is that if the hand is too strong for a 1NT overcall then it is too strong for a suit overcall|pg||
nt|dburn: 1NT is flawed, of course, but everything else is flawder|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@H showing a real strong jump overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: it has long been debated whether North's 2@h is forcing on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but his 3@h is certainly forcing|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  I would have though 2@h would be enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: North did surely want to make a forcing bid, opposite a 1NT response.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it will do him much good - he won't make it, but that's partly because West doesn't have the decency to hold @hK as part of his opening|pg||
nt|rmb1: spade ruff kills this|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|h2|nt|dburn: normally, a 1NT response to a takeout double shows more values than South has|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: so of course North wanted to make a forcing bid opposite it|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: What would North have rebid opposite a 2@C response? I suppose 2@H is enough then.|pg||
nt|dburn: but he might have given more consideration to playing 3NT rather than 4@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suppose 3NT was open to South, even if he held three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but doesnt any heart bid show a hand that was too strong to overcall 1@h?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this isn't an easy hand at all - any North-South who go plus will have done well|pg||

nt|paulg:  In the other matches, England lead Ireland 59-54 imps and Wales lead the WBU (Wales II) by 45-41 imps|pg||
nt|toobad: 3nt?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|diana1: not much breaking well here|pg||
mb|d|nt|justin c: 12 imps to wales on the one where it went 1@D-4@S-5@D-X here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sheila a: NS likely to bid 3NT and likely to be disappointed|pg||
nt|paulg:  The schedule restart is in 30 minutes, 21:50 GMT|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: in the other room, 1@D-4@S, all out|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|justin c: (rather improbably)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|garnetts: I like the negative redouble here as east promising 0 or 1 in partner's suit--pass and double with balanced values |pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C looks like a transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: 1@d is unbal with either minor, 1NT is a game force|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toobad: D or S?|pg||
nt|greerm: no reason to think of a @D|pg||
nt|greerm: hard to see how this will make, but 8 tricks there so....|pg||
nt|toobad: needs help|pg||
nt|greerm: defence might let him set up a @H trick ?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|paulg:  the defence has to be quite careful to beat this I think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|greerm: North will have to find the @D suit soon|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|paulg:  needs to switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am truly amazed that West passed 4@S in the OR--must have failed to pay an entry fee |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|h2|nt|greerm: home now|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|paulg:  in some relay systems south would have shown nothing about her hand on this auction|pg||
nt|paulg:  and it would do her no good at all this time|pg||
nt|sheila a: Unless West is put off leading a @s and tries a @c ...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chessmaste: That was a good (inspired?) decision by North to pass 3@H|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sheila a: Scotland edge into the lead thanks to a tiny swing on the awkward board 11|pg||
pc|h4|nt|greerm: missed the "obvious " squeez that we can see|pg||
nt|garnetts: totally agree--North seems to be agressive mostly then suddenly makes a very conservative pass |pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, South did not bid 2@S which would have shown a strong raise, so he knew the dummy would be modest|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a: hard to see any more than 7 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|diana1: the EW played in 3@c-2|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@c-1|pg||
nt|sheila a: Sime judged to pass the W hand over 1NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: which made things simpler|pg||
nt|paulg:  if Vi takes theis and plays a spade, then West may feel it is necessary to cash @cA for down one|pg||
