nt|psridhar: the 9 spot made a diff of ONE trick here|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S may look foolish when (a) you go for 1100 and (b) you are on BBO. But it might have been effective. I never like to deter people from pre-empting because I have suffered myself ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: when teammates were reluctant to pre-empt - always finding an excuse...|pg||

pc|s4|mc|8|nt|Walddk2: Next round: Olanski - Vainikonis (£1,100) vs Zia - Bakhshi (£1,700)|pg||
nt|brolucius: There were various sensible ways of bidding the West cards. It is difficult to judge which one was best when we can see all four hands.|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: All information about an auction can be found here: www.tgrsbridge.com|pg||
nt|brolucius: Zia's partner, David Bakhshi, has a high finish in the world pairs final to his credit (something like 7th).  He has partnered Andrew Robson quite a bit - a strong performer. (Zia ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: is OK too...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGR's Bridge Club is located in central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W have scored 150 or 180 in no-trumps so far, scoring around three times as many match-points as those picking up only 90 in diamonds. |pg||
nt|psridhar: 2@d bid was weak strategy|pg||
nt|brolucius: The two top scores are for +200 defending against a black-suit contract by N/S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Everyone knows that 5@D is rarely a good competitor for 3NT, at matchpoints. The same can be said in the part-score region.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The West hand screams "No-trumps!"  Whether that means you should ignore the fact that you are too strong for 1NT and make that bid anyway, I would not know.|pg||
nt|psridhar: even an o/c of 1N over 1c seems ok|pg||
nt|reisig: I make the bid ..and have my excuse ready (sorry..miscounted)  :)|pg||
nt|ady: I think the first choise of double made life awkward    not good enough to then bid 2 no-trumps opposite a passing partner    better to start with an overcall of 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 18 is fine opposite a passed partner, and unpassed LHO|pg||
pg||

nt|brolucius: overcall then.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1D|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: It can never be very wrong to be 1 points heavy or light, since this will only affect the expectations marginally.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: The danger for N-S here is to allow declarer to make 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: major suite game for e/w|pg||
nt|psridhar: wdnt 2s been enuf ?]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  best|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H suggests around 8-10 but West correctly adds a bit for his fifth card in a major.|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@h was a good choice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club, club not good for the defence. Must set up a diamond trick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Now we see it|pg||
nt|jbgood: but as long as Zia jumps in spades they would always get to game|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Vainikonis has to switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|ady: sure will switch|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius: A change of suit is normally played as forcing, facing a jump response. So 2@S would normally be forcing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not obvious, @C2 could be a singleton|pg||
nt|jbgood: I get questions from the audience about Zia's bid: Wouldnt 2@s be frocing? In my world it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: forcing even:)|pg||

nt|psridhar: i suspect many EW will make 11-so it maybe only a 65% score for Zia|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: We will have to remember whether West or South is the declarer.|pg||
nt|psridhar: even if N bids @c ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: Zia hopes David's 'good weak' is not too good:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: South could show him his cards:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C can be anything in Polish Club, ofgten 12-14 balanced, so a diamond lead should not be far off|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players overbid opposite partner's weak-two openings. Zia knows that he is not remotely close to a game-try.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Can make with careful play when @SK is onside|pg||
nt|psridhar: helpfull Kibs say it makes :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: would a high heart from S help the defense?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But declarer has to guess South's shape and that is not easy|pg||

nt|psridhar: Vul Vs Not ...1st seat 2@C with 4-4 in majors ....bit 2 difff for me to grasp :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has (easily) enough for 4@H, so presumably he is hoping for some helpful rebid (such as diamond shortage) that would allow him to look for a slam.|pg||
