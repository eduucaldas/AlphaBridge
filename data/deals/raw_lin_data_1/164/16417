nt|bridge_one: Hello Slawek :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphp2: sorry for problems, Kalita played 7 of spade the result is -3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, lead a card and claim|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|an| |nt|sfoxa:  danger!|pg||

nt|tomi2: Tuszynski - Kowalski have been playing together for many years, I bet they know their follow-ups to multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree with pass by West - the DBL means only points, for sure not long @h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C would be forced|pg||

nt|vbman: so 1 nt is weak?|pg||

nt|Gerben42: this contract is much safer|pg||
nt|vbman: or 15-17?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14 balanced hands are opened 1@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like this 3@S bid with this flat hand and a known 8 card fit only|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|sfoxa:  N knows partner has maximum hand with @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: west will need to decide what ace partner has|pg||
nt|vbman: and the rebid after 1 red suit is?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|bridge_one: passed hoping in 2 @s tricks - difficult to think North void in @S !|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 12-14 they start a "rescue" sequence and try to find a ceah major fit before 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: only nuclear weapon against this transfers:)|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But you bid a major over 1@D (0-7) if you have 12-14. Can be 3 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: on this level they rarely bid without a reason|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is not natural. it may include "any 0-6 hand"|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: 3@D is probably invitational. North has support a single but minimum and no aces. this time 3@D is the best spot for them|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello everyone!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duking the D risk Q@D @d ruff losing after the K@D|pg||
nt|vbman: taking the low road resulted well|pg||
nt|vbman: if they played in nt it wd be a 15 point difference|pg||
nt|vbman: operator what are ns talking now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: felt it|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tez: my asistant says ''we say "side suit first" :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most of the breaks will be because most Polish players smoke - so they need a short time in such 12 board matches|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tomi2: even if he went down it would gain lots of imps since NS made 4@S over there|pg||
nt|pfbr: "assistant" :)|pg||
nt|nagini: personally I would choose  pepsi a pd|pg||
nt|vbman: smoking kills|pg||
nt|tomi2: this hand is easy in polish club, you open 1@C and start counting your points. For EW here 1@C is a limited opening, so Jagniewski had to guess or count his points first before ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: opening|pg||
mb|1H|an| |nt|tez: in vuln normal 3@h opening|pg||
nt|nagini: one condition only: as my sponsor:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: light openung|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tomi2: the best movement for the players was "4-board BAM swiss" so they had to wait for the other results and couls smore every 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: players was talking about previous board|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think with wests hand you should not force your partnership to the 5th level if you start the match leading in the 25 VP margin|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nagini: pepsi has a feeling in fingers:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad controls isnt worth 12|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but I by today's standards, it's pretty sound -- a couple of 10's, and a couple of honor tricks make up for the acelessness.|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, if you can get them to take a phantom save, vul, it does have its merits.|pg||
nt|tomi2: you already need a good dummy to cause s relative flat score compared to passing 4@H with those two major aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: good correction to 5@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if partner cannot open 2@S, probably the suit is insufficient|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bridge_one: 2@D of course is multi - long @h or @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: if 4@H was making you need to escape for -3 maximum to have a relatively flat board|pg||
nt|tomi2: while you need a huge dummy to turn a bad baord into a good one - but this will not bring you more VP tan you already have|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: but it riscs going down more or going down while 4@H was not making - in those scenarios you lose imps. so IMO bidding can win very seldom but lose very often|pg||
mb|4N|nt|tomi2: the players don't know the running score but they know the score after 12 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|othered1: Effective double by north.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be worried about @C now|pg||
nt|othered1: He can hold this to -1 with the right view on the minor suit positions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but might take a wrong view on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is to give the A in @D - cab be usefull for the lead|pg||

nt|nagini: @h|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|nt|tomi2: I guess this was a puppet stayman sequence, 3@C asked for majors, 3@D= at least one 4 card major, 3@H=spades 3@S=fit 3NT is forcing then showing interest in slam|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|vbman: so does anyone think the current score must be told to the players?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: not ruffing high is a pretty extreme position here|pg||

nt|tomi2: 5nt now should ask for kings, but I am not 100% sure about their methods|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
nt|nagini: classic polish bluff|pg||
mb|d|nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: wow|pg||

nt|nagini: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
nt|vbman: push board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: am quite suprised that Russian did not bid 2@D after 1@S - that is a GF relay promising at least 3 card support in @S and enough for game|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
nt|tomi2: skipping the 2@D relay often indicates a) not such good 3 card support and/or b) a better heart suit|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this to give the possibility to defend knowing a minimum of 3 cards |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|tez: is it real or need undo|pg||

mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If you play diamonds first and they break you now have 11 tricks and can play for a squeeze|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = max 3 cards support|pg||
nt|tomi2: Kowalski ince again found the killing lead|pg||
nt|vbman: no  h lead then margin is very wide|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|bridge_one: very aggressive|pg||

mb|4H|an| |nt|Walddk2: Low from a doubleton in Poland|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently 1NT was forcing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@H is the normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Funny looking auction, but it was systemic and got to the normal spot.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT was strong bal. 2@D = transfer to @H 2NT superaccept :)|pg||
nt|nagini: wow who did start this fitre?:)|pg||

nt|nagini: they are hungry i thik|pg||

mb|4N|nt|nigel_k:  If you play hearts first and they don't break your entries are destroyed even if the diamonds were 3-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: south showed a stiong hand with spades till now, north is just starting to show what he has. now its some medium hand with @Ds and @Cs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D = repeat xfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: traffic light in his favior |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like 3 rounds of spades will get it 2 down|pg||
nt|nagini: boring finrsse|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 3Nt means = choise the game|pg||
mb|5C|nt|tomi2: but no more communication, spades hearts and clbus are blocked ir isolated|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/liga/liga2010-11/pierwsza/LIrunda10.html  for running scores|pg||

nt|nagini: will be a fire|pg||
nt|po-s: Does East know what is trumps?|pg||
nt|po-s: and since when?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: since they are GF now 3@D shows some interest, north has two aces, maye he will try for slam|pg||
nt|nagini: imagine|pg||
mb|6C|nt|tomi2: if south had a better @H stopper and not such great fit, he would bid 3nt over 3@C directly|pg||
nt|tez: ty Monika|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so 420|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer may not read the lead as short, but it shouldn't matter as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: then South will also score his @H10|pg||
mb|6S|nt|po-s: what if South doesn´t have the club king?|pg||
nt|nagini: claim 7|pg||
nt|othered1: or do thy lead rusinow?|pg||
nt|vbman: thats ok for me now thanks all and good luck to players|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: then he has 17 points and opens 1@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: thx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh well, he gets a small heart anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can score @H10 as well|pg||

nt|Gerben42: perhaps they will show their 1@C 1N system again|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@h probably down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in the previous hand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No ideal bid for Kalita here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess one has double although that would indicate four spades|pg||
nt|tomi2: he could cash @S before to have 9 tricks for sure and finesse later or catch the singleton queen and play @S10 and then the other spades|pg||
nt|po-s: obviously quite clear to everybody...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: here 4@S ON also with A@C and @C lead because opener will play A@S and @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = 3 cards raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  that was the way, yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 3@H with 4cards raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is limit +|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tez: @c leads beat 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Some pairs play that double shows spades and 1@s denies them|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No game makes for N-S but that's because South has no opener (in my view)|pg||
nt|nagini: sped for to be down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Otherwise hands like North have no good bid|pg||
nt|nagini: nmf|pg||
pc|c7|nt|frankaus: agree - only 25 zars - do u like zars  - i'm a fan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like popcorn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: zars the same as smarties?|pg||
nt|frankaus: zar's hand evalution system  - link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I stick to the 4321 scale but I am no fan. It is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|tomi2: Let me try to introduce the format they are playing here. This is the Polish Premiere League. 16 Teams play a compleate round robin on thwo weekends, so they will finish sunday but ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: then the "fun" will start. The field will be torn into groups of 4 - basicly its most important to be top 8 after sunday|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tez: but we are sure he will lead @d ace or @s ace|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tez: normal lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a kinitz told me 2NT is GF|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C would be nmf. I guess they play some GF checkback or so|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tomi2: then the teams will play one "K-O" against teams from their group, the first 8 may still become Champions, the last 8 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
nt|tomi2: south just shows a balanced hand with 6 clubs and probably 3@S and not a good heart stop. interesting what north makes with those information havin 2 hearts only too|pg||
nt|tomi2: should Olanski do something here?|pg||
nt|nagini: gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C=any invit hand 2@D=any GF hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: take @c play @h first..you can make it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H = invite, 2Nt=GF both with raise in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a interesting option|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tomi2: playing this method south was not able to show a good/bad hand. he has 3 kings and one ace, but could have had some queens and jacks|pg||
nt|tomi2: and since he opened 1nt on AKAK last hand he cant have more than this|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting choice by South to bid game with what loks like a lot of worthless black cards and bad trumps, the DQ as the only plus value - but lucky|pg||
nt|po-s: 3rd hand openings don´t deny an opening...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c4|nt|trotto:  2@d = ask , 2nt 6 clubs , 3 @d relay ,  3@s= 3226 = , 4 @d - end signal( call P for bid 4 @h) 4 @s  = game @s sign off|pg||
nt|trotto:  tuszynski after  3 @s  bid knew about risky  to play  3 N    doubletons @h mirror|pg||
nt|nagini: i would prefer yo play longest suits... but whathever yuo wish sir:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tomi2: so this sequence must show mild slam interest from partner and south could go on imo|pg||
nt|nagini: would prefer 3 nt |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|tomi2: i think he showed a weaker hand than he has with the 2@H bid. I guess he had some constructive raise available.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|frankaus: A & K get better evaluated - Q,s down graded|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nagini: 6 sp 1430|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tez: now need to play @s ..from hand|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|ralfwil: S must be careful in this contract|pg||
nt|nagini: then wht to win?:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A low heart from North works because you hold heart losers to one and can still ruff two diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But that is looking at all four hands of course|pg||
nt|tez: pls lead partners suit:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: close to open this , i wouldnt but I am a big non-fan of QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|po-s: It looks like they abandoned old Polish club and play transfers over 1club openings|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes and they dont open 1@C on very stong hands, so this 2nt becomes free for some conventional meaning|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: Now he made up for it, but .....|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @DQ and @C KQ ill not be such gr8 assets|pg||

nt|nagini: Apek will do ... technics:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: a kib points out, that we are playing only black suits here all the time. What happend to good old hearts and diamonds? :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 18-20 he would rebid 1NT, with a weak NT hand 1@H|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|trotto:  4 @d as  let's says "  signal of End"  . better knowed at polish " wywolanie koncowe"|pg||
nt|nagini: so have some food:):) ty:)|pg||
nt|trotto: e.g. if the opener has distrubution like 3-3-1-6 and the last answer to relay was 3@h, then 3@s = rkcb on @c fixed (because @c are the longest) 3nt to play, 4@c - rkcb on @s fixed ...|pg||
nt|trotto: (because if 2 suits are equal priority goes to major suit), 4@d - as explained above, 4@h rkcb @h, 4@s rkcb @d |pg||

pc|d7|nt|tomi2: his plan was to attack declarer in trumps with that weak ones in dummy|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|warrens:  but I think declarer will get endplayed in dummy at the end and be forced to give a trump promotion.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally 2 trick in the trump, and after all the goood cards - when opps ruff remain with one trump - now you play last trump and make the rest of tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh well, dead now|pg||
mc|11|nt|bridge_one: no possibility here because no communication to play the last trump after the ruff of @D|pg||
