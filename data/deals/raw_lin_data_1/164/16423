mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2H!|nt|dburn: decent result for East-West at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c would make for North-South, and I suppose 3NT would have some sort of chance also|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulhac:  Difficult to beat 3NT|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4C|mb|4D|nt|paulhac:  And more difficult to bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Especially now|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, not really possible to bid - but 4@c was OK, and has pushed East-West|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: But there is always room for one for the road|pg||
nt|dburn: unfortunately it has also pushed North, which it probably should not have done|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the defence needs to take some care|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But it still needs careful defense|pg||
nt|dburn: if for example West cashes a diamond now....|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Diamond switch and it will be made|pg||
nt|dburn: ...or returns anything but a heart...|pg||
nt|drewsky: yes, paul...the defense has to play a heart now, and THEN immediatley cash their @D trick|pg||
nt|ady: 10.00     5.15|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Hi Ronan |pg||
mb|3C|an|denies 3h|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Best to avoid 3NT here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play a home-grown strong club system known as the Delberto Club |pg||
nt|idc: The 1@h was alerted - it is natural but may conceal a longer @d suit if fewer than about 11/12 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|georgia19: 3nt of course, is cold - as usual|pg||

nt|peachy: Wales as the hosts field two teams|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@h looks fine|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome everyone to this 3rd round Camrose match between England & Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: North in his box|pg||
nt|idc: Nice try by Brian Short to shut out West but Derek Patterson doesn't know the meaning of "shut out"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: diamond ruff may loom|pg||
nt|idc: The names as they stand are mixed up but better to get the first hand details right - we'll correct the names when we have time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable for West to bid both his suits - he has a fair hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: it's a pity 3@c didn't promise all those clubs - S would have raised then|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hard for East to realise that partner has an entry - but if the queen is dropped he should fins the switch|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a: declarer can ditch second @c on a @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But then North can cross to @HA to discard a club. Oh well|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|georgia19: Patterson/Crouch had a brilliant first half and obviously mean to continue|pg||
nt|idc: I know some players who might rebid 3NT with the North hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: so do I|pg||
nt|idc: Not that I'm saying it is right, just that it is this time|pg||

pc|d5|nt|bigtrain: speaking of bridge...  anyone have an idea of systems we will be watching?|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Well played to cash the A@H as West could have the singleton K on the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South for Scotland displaying a certain level of inertia in the bidding so far|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: 3@C by Short was very timid|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|dburn: well, he was facing a passed partner|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulhac:  Is 1@D automatic these days?|pg||
nt|dburn: even so, he might have made some invitational move|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: He was, but a partner who bid 2NT vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not for the Scots|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: for Liggins it has been automatic since 1975, when he was about three|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk5: 3NT is a little lucky|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 5@C is the sound contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As everybody knows, I am a conservative bidder, but I could not bringmyself to bid just 3C as North :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I'd rather be in 6@C than 3NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: sorry about the confusion, no defections as yet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might as well end it all now, Ian|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: should be a flat board alright|pg||
nt|sheila a: Who knows the final scores from last night?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Welsh BU 18, |pg||
nt|cuttysark: bridge.silverexter.eu/results might have a clue|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: A link should be posted at some point|pg||
nt|idc: that's what prospective partners all say|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mikeirl: England 17/13 against Ireland|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have the EW system - weak notrump, 4-card majors is pretty popular in scotland but we will see|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: NS are playing a Carrot club (11-13 bal or 17+)|pg||
nt|idc: "no defections", heh, I like it Ronan|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose after the double you might finesse the diamonds but it's asking quite a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: This is a fun-looking hand - can N-S reach slam?   and do they want to?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S is natural, possibly 4 cards in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|2S!|an|2h would be good raise|nt|justin c: 2@H natural is the way to play here|pg||
nt|steveray: afternoon, Bill, Ian|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
mb|2N|an|2 suits|nt|mikeirl: silvertexter|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: indeed, both Dbl and NT are available for the other suits|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose that makes more sense where people open 1@H with 10xxx :)|pg||
nt|justin c: if W can have 4 small, you cant get shut out with a good hand with @H|pg||
nt|justin c: as you say, lots of takeout bids available|pg||
nt|chick: oh, nevermind, it wasn't the opening bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes NS play 2-way 1@C opener, 14-16 nt, upside down carding|pg||
mb|3C|nt|idc: Hi Steve & Bill|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it was sime who was thinking there|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to take some hundreds|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: matehson experimenting with the 3-card rebid at a bad time - Sime also a bit pushy|pg||
nt|sheila a: I don't like the look of this contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxx: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
nt|sheila a: thanks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Somehow it seems that the 4-3 fit attracts bad breaks more often than ot should :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: South hand may be too short of entries to make this a good one|pg||
nt|georgia19: wonder how many they'll make, apart from the (normal) @d break, everything is perfect|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|milton_se: very timid pass by South|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: EW are strong notrump, 5-card majors, weak-2@D@H@S, standard count, upside down attitude|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sheila a: I think I prefer 2@d from Sime's hand - if partner has 4 @h it's easy for him to bid them|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks like all it needs is a 3-3 break and @CA onside|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: I expect that however many it is, it'll be too many for their peace of mind|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|athene: garvey decides 2@D is a nice spot to stop - of course with his partner being a passed hand there is less danger of missing game, passing a transfer|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: I don't mind the double - but perhaps East should just bid 2N, or West settle for 3@H|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|pc|c8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what about 4@c by North over 2NT? |pg||

pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

nt|Walddk5: did you not?|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|dburn: no - I have played with Fawcett, Price and Callaghan, but not with Liggins|pg||

mb|3N|nt|Walddk5: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: is he? how will he manage that?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1@D here shows either minor. 1N some sort of forcing enquiry. After that David will explain|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||

nt|athene: you never get rich beating NV contracts a bunch, not doubled|pg||
nt|georgia19: but as predicted (or not)  too many tricks for comfort|pg||
nt|idc: South could raise 3@d to 4@d but I think passing 3@c is right|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|sheila a: Garvey-Carroll play a Polish Club style so this shows @c|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks like 3NT from here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|steveray: 3nt here|pg||
nt|idc: WHich only leaves North's 4@c - partner has come in vul v not after both opps have bid, so should have a decent 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2N presumably a game-forcing enquiry|pg||
nt|mikeirl: par score battle|pg||
nt|mikeirl: *part|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4S 5+minor|nt|peachy: 2H is enough even for law aficianados|pg||
nt|peachy: with a defensive trick|pg||
nt|justin c: i see a @C a @H and 2@D for NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: forcing with support or balanced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D=0+@d, denies 6m unless 4M, as here|pg||
nt|georgia19: so where will this one end.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c=art FG|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mikeirl: no defence to beat this|pg||
nt|sheila a: 3@c = minimum|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South worried about the diamond stopper|pg||
nt|sheila a: I presume partner could have asked about majors if he wanted, so his cards should be in minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: well judged|pg||
nt|peachy: I suspect Dbl was takeout oriented|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes well timed and really good defense to beat game double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Walker has shown 12-15 bal|pg||
mb|3C!|an|singleton heart|nt|cuttysark: It seems you can ake 6@C by ruffing finesse against @DA to pitch 2 spades|pg||
nt|sheila a: I wouldn't want to be in it|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 5@H has good chance to make|pg||
nt|milton_se: and no double - very cheap save|pg||
nt|chick: who should double? :)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|justin c: doubleton @CQ in the pocket, and the @HK right|pg||
nt|idc: To look on the bright side, we'll see comparisons for those first 2 boards soon enough|pg||
nt|georgia19: as you can see, 13 tricks are available in @c's or NT, but needing both finesses for that , they'll probably settle for 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I expect it was bid as sac, insurance against potential making 4S|pg||
nt|justin c: friendly layout for dec|pg||
nt|mikeirl: would be uncomfortable on a spade lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|idc: for any specs new to BBO vugraph, use the 'Movie' feature to follow progress in the other table of this match|pg||
nt|georgia19: BRIGHT side Ian, are you sure?|pg||
nt|georgia19: first board must have been bad for the Scots|pg||
nt|idc: Yup, beats waiting for 2 hours if you start in the Open room - don't mind losing IMPs, it's the waiting I hate|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: might make 12 tricks - for example on a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: Jxxx isn't all that appealing but if you think neither opponent has four, it's not so bad|pg||
mb|5N|an|pick a slam|nt|peachy: declarer will be happy|pg||
nt|steveray: certainly not a testing contract to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Assuming 4@D is a Splinter, North cues? Or worried about his spade stopper?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to avoid being forced to open up the hearts, if they want four tricks|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sheila a: It's an odd sequence if S really did show minimum and N signed off in 3NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: ah now it makes more sense|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if North couls sign off in 4n?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s=no singleton or void|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Spade lead really the only one to give a problem - guess at trick one|pg||
nt|sheila a: Early gain for Ireland - Scotland played board 1 in the no hope 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxx: crouch not sure what 4h is|pg||
nt|georgia19: only a spade gives nothing - or a trump I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: safe now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a tad kangaroo at the end|pg||
pc|c2|nt|milton_se: would certainly as West. knowing tehe|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Pigot for Ireland stuck in an overcall - perhaps showing both Majors? and the fit was lost|pg||
nt|idc: Well, even if Peter wasn't entirely sure about 4@h this still looks well bid|pg||
nt|georgia19: is that a new bridge expressiion, mike?|pg||
nt|idc: Combined 27 count with some wasted in @h and they still get to a good slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the Kangaroo Klub - a bit leapy and jumpy (and possible Skippy as well)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|hT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: England made 5@c on board 17|pg||
pc|s2|nt|milton_se: there's no freak distribution|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't have the comm to eliminate @D for the throw in|pg||
nt|idc: The Open room starts with Bds 15 & 16 of course, so this room is 2 bds ahead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|idc: I suspect that @cA was played because it feels good when you drop a stiff K|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|sheila a: Shows the value of interfering with the opponents' NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|justin c: anybody else think double was rather unnecessary here?|pg||
nt|peachy: Adrian asssured additional dummy entries by saving his H4, not that he needed them this time|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|c8|nt|idc: And with Short/Walker in the other room, the chances of them catching up with us are ...not good|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|chick: W has singleton heart and one ace|pg||
nt|athene: he would never be likely to refuse the trump finesse anyway - but 140 is fair enough|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|c9|nt|chick: his partner only promised 3 spades and 13 cards|pg||
nt|idc: As epika points out to me from spec, it's a bit anti-percentage|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|justin c: imagine this will end up in 3NT by W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: such hardships you have|pg||
mb|2H!|an|6H 4-7HCP|nt|athene: subtle sort of bid now from east, like 3nt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5@C not the worst contract in the world here|pg||
nt|georgia19: but she's right, always drink the bad before the good ......my kind husband has already filled my glass - but I don't know with what, except it's red|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now west has to decide among pass, 4@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has to show that singleton diamond somehow though|pg||
nt|steveray: so where would we like to play this one, 5@c, major moysian,??|pg||
nt|idc: true - can they avoid matchpoint NT-itis though?|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: quite possible that south will just suggest notrumps at some point and north will go along with it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that will do, usually|pg||
nt|georgia19: apparently it's Bandol, is it my birthday?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: E might have slam aspirations, but he doesn't have a bid to show it|pg||
nt|athene: there is a case for saying this should be specifically 6-4|pg||
nt|athene: ok, that will do the trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Paul Hackett|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: now south is only playing in 5, 6 or 7 @C|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: i would bid 4@D with south now|pg||
nt|steveray: not even Matheson could manage those @d's|pg||
nt|athene: reverse splinter|pg||
nt|athene: saying i have nothing wasted in diamonds, facing the shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 7 controls, 5-card good major and 5-4 sort of speaks in favor of trump contract, but opposite that dummy, 3NT is best|pg||
nt|peachy: 8 controls, sorry|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, wrong again, I have to admit, I'd at least bid game|pg||
nt|milton_se: so he passed :) -- don't understand that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The Irish tend to open 1@C on most hands with their 2-way methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: i dont know their bidding methods here|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live In Running Scores at all tables got to http://bridge.silvertexter.eu then "browse results" then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: the logic would go something like:- you can't bid it on 5-4 because that is not enough shape to go past 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: i don't fancy either major-suit moysian, with the wrong hand getting forced|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: another flat board|pg||
nt|athene: but you can't be 5-5 because you didn't michaels / whatever|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think this will quite fetch|pg||
nt|georgia19: here I go again, i predict this will not make|pg||
pc|hK|nt|justin c: probably 3@S was a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: either to play there or the start of some minor suit slam try|pg||
nt|athene: and east seems to be playing it for 6-4 rather than 5-5|pg||
nt|steveray: Hi Paul, belated Happy New Year|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|athene: south has a huge hand for a passed hand, facing short diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: Perhaps EW should just shut their eyes and bid something over it|pg||
nt|athene: lucky clubs aren't 5-2 otherwise three rounds of clubs would promote a trump for one down|pg||
nt|idc: Other room has caught us up - I'm happy now since I get the minus scores immediately with no wait whatsoever.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: he can't possibly be any better|pg||

nt|georgia19: now what? small spade?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: off fetching teas and coffees|pg||
nt|idc: My guess is that Scottish npc said to make the English pay, and his team has misinterpreted it|pg||
nt|georgia19: he's a nice guy, actually, a rareity among the top players ( or is it rarity?)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: I would assume so too, in which case 3NT response likely conventional|pg||
nt|georgia19: careful, Ian, that was funny|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|justin c: not sure why he didnt prefer stayman tho|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|steveray: sensible spot|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sensible contract|pg||
nt|idc: Be interesting to know if 2@c denies a major even as an unpassed hand|pg||
nt|athene: what was barry crane's rule about 2-way finesses? the queen lies over the jack in the majors?|pg||
nt|athene: or was it the other way round?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sheila a: Hard to blame anyone for passing on that W hand!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|idc: If so, there's a lot to be said for forgetting about 4-3 fits where the lonmg hand gets forced, so 3@h & 3@s here may not be natural |pg||
nt|paulhac:  As he may have to ruff diamonds the percentage line is to play East for the Q unless he can get a count|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|steveray: not the obvious @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: you can't draw trumps and throw a heart on a spade and ruff hearts in dummy, so you have to try reversing dummy i guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: I got confirmation from kib that 3S indeed was the only way to stop in 3NT, it asked opener to bid 3NT|pg||

nt|idc: so far those are the only kind that Scotland gains on|pg||
mb|1H|nt|justin c: v good bidding method|pg||

nt|georgia19: one is supposed to blether when the hands are boring, Ian, that's what we're here for in part|pg||
mb|3S|nt|milton_se: can they avoid 6D now?|pg||
nt|idc: South could splinter (4@c) but has more playing strength than usual for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so maybe it was a bit trickier than it appeared|pg||
nt|idc: plus a good diamond suit, so I doubt he will splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Interesting 3@s - maybe 3@d would be NF|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: Blackwood in a minute, one suspects|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|idc: I'd love if Crouch bid 4@c but ... |pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: It's almost too good for a 14-16 NT - this hand should play well|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lucky the club finesse works - a diamond switch now will ake him sweat|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or a spade and another heart|pg||

pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: Not sure it's alertable - Gaz allows East to jump about with liited values because with 16+ he starts with 2@C|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: 4@H might go wrong though - might be hard to draw trumps with no entries to east|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzxx: not the best set for Joneses|pg||
nt|chick: nope|pg||
mc|8|nt|mikeirl: They're in 4@S|pg||

nt|dburn: this is a two-way club, I think|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|cuttysark: Indeed it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dburn: but as usual, I think but Roland knows|pg||
nt|Walddk5: MacPolish Club as Liz calls it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, not sure about the 1@d response either|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|Walddk5: Sooner or later they will end up in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I feel I should know what it means - suggest 2-way|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Later apparently|pg||
nt|dburn: OK - 1@d any 0-11|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@h any 12+|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This does not look like any old 11 to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Rather good for 0-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: they do use some other bids, but 1@h and 1@s appear to cover most things|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Did Charles devise this system? Is it played by anyone else?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think it is Unique Outred|pg||
nt|dburn: the answers to both of those are "I don't know"|pg||
nt|paulhac:  You could be a disciple Roland|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or, Yes, and No|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I can't even play Acol, so this system is totally out|pg||
nt|dburn: still, they get to make a lot of bids before ending in 3NT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: and their card and notes are very well completed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 2@C was some form of 5card Stayman, so this lead does not catch the eye|pg||
nt|dburn: so we can hope to see more of the methods in action|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulhac:  Just a question of whether they make 5 or more likely 6|pg||

nt|sheila a: It appears that E opened 4@s in 3rd seat on board 12|pg||
nt|athene: 4 imps sorry - they were NV so only 50|pg||
nt|athene: i would open west a 20-21 or 20-22 2nt|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sheila a: Which made sure of not missing game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well that gets the job done!|pg||
nt|idc: to be fair to me, I was looking at the screen through a red mist ... sigh|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lots of aces and a 5-card suit - not even minimum for 2nt in my opinion|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: A very excellent job by our vugraph operator Marcin!! |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S  on a finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: err...|pg||
nt|ady: assuming no heart ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: replay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: action replay, no less|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|jtr: North cant move|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if he does he will find out that they are off 2 keycards|pg||
nt|sheila a: Sime's opening ran the risk of keeping NS out of a non-making game|pg||
nt|mikeirl: imps for Scotland on Board 28 - E/W are in 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: you might even consider rising the @HK here, to start clubs from the right side|pg||
nt|athene: on the grounds that the spades are more of a worry than the hearts anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jtr: True|pg||
nt|justin c: double at other table, looking for @S lead|pg||
nt|sheila a: It looks like an opening bid to me, to be fair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: sry, lost connection|pg||
nt|georgia19: we seem to have got to the last board skipping a lot - now what contract gives 29 imps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it went down here for a while, scots in 4h + 2, maybe 6 on|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: then they let out a 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I agree - these 5-5s just have to be opened|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|sheila a: Feisty double from Matheson|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, they got every chance to stay out of it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Singleton in partner's suit and a trump trick - good combination|pg||
nt|sheila a: But Sime is thinking .....|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He pulled a double yesterday to a game he just might have made - hopefully he has learned something|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 5@D is trouble!|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|sheila a: Phew!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to trust partner in these situations - gives you the shouting rights|pg||
nt|sheila a: That's the danger of doubling for one off - you give your partner another chance to bid :)|pg||
nt|idc: Two specs have asked the sensible question about the defensive carding last hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: I think Matheson is hoping for at least 2 down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: normal to lead to a big one first with that suit, if you have enough entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|milton_se: no way to nine tricks unless South lets go of a spade -- or they set up a H|pg||
nt|athene: gain against Ax onside or stiff jack offside|pg||
nt|athene: ok that was last i think? thanks all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good time to finish, this - almost Beer Time where I live |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mikeirl: leads to 15/15|pg||
nt|idc: All the scores in except this Bd - so well done to England on their win|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: While this hand is taking its twelve winners, a genreal point: |pg||
nt|chick: heart will work though|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jtr: Slight risk in taking the trump finesse|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only half way, Michael, lots more excitement to come :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 13 Walker managed to make 2@s, despite the 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes - solid bridge played here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|milton_se: 10D is killing|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sheila a: Double part score swing|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|milton_se: no! not any more...|pg||
nt|chick: I think he can still do it|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: I note that Short did not open the North hand :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some of us play K for count and Ace fot attitude|pg||
nt|idc: so I should reply that I would encourage as North (high in their system)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|sheila a: Does that earn him a brownie point from you?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Half a mark|pg||
nt|mikeirl: will Garvey lead a low @C now?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: S is squeezed in spades and hearts|pg||
nt|idc: but that I can't imagine not playing @hK at trick 2 as SOuth were I to decide to continue the suit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: Better had, I think|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|peachy: this was the last bd of the set, next set schedule after about 15 min break|pg||
nt|peachy: opearator, is that still the plan?|pg||
nt|sheila a: This match is very tight. Garvey and Carroll have played steadily|pg||
nt|mikeirl: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And thanks to Ronan for great operating under difficult circumstances!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|milton_se: 3 clubs mashes South|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|georgia19: very gracious, Ian, nice to have your company but I think the English had the rub of the green|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: also thanks to our excellent commentators|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk4: Georgia, Ian, Mike|pg||
