nt|Walddk2: welcome to Ben Thompson|pg||
mb|3C|an|cue raise|mb|p|nt|benjent:  hi everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2011&dir=ayc  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|benjent:  I'll just announce my tiny side interest here|pg||
nt|benjent:  North is my nephew Jamie|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C diamond support I assume; I think double is better to get the majors in|pg||
nt|benjent:  And I think my brother (Jamie's dad) is the bbo operator |pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They both overbid a tad|pg||
nt|benjent:  Puh-lenty|pg||
pc|cA|nt|benjent:  EW are both from Melbourne, where I live. Nice women, developing at a great rate of knots|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Garozzo says: if you don't lead it, you don't have a singleton. Anyway, this will go plenty down regardless|pg||
nt|benjent:  5@d is not 100% hopeless, and there's some good news, but the breaks are just a bit too tough|pg||
nt|benjent:  If Ellena guesses the @s's and gets the @d out of Lucy's (West's) hand, she can get a few tricks together|pg||
nt|benjent:  still, this one's gonna hurt a bit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Declarer is asking about leads and signals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 tricks if she guesses spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and gets West's diamond away as Bden pointed out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ben|pg||
nt|benjent:  EW kind of need to draw a trump themselves|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Serhat Ozenir|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and welcome to Bas van Beijsterveldt|pg||
nt|benjent:  hi Serhat|pg||
nt|neobas: G'day everyone :)|pg||

nt|neobas: What is the scoring in this event? IMP Pairs?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2011&dir=ayc  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|serhat: yes|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|serhat: I think so|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|benjent:  the qualifying had an unusual scoring method as well|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Not the best defence one has to say (if one is diplomatic)|pg||
nt|benjent:  misguessing the @s's isn't necessarily completely terrible|pg||
nt|serhat: Ben I believe N is your nephew?|pg||
nt|benjent:  North is in fact my 14-year old nephew|pg||
nt|benjent:  Jamie and Ellena are the leading U21 pair in this event|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finesse, cash 2 more diamonds and knock out @HA. Then only 1 down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|serhat: I met him last year in Canberra. He is a good boy|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was 2 down to begin with, then 3, then 1 and finally back to 2|pg||
nt|benjent:  Ellena would have done better to run the @d to the 10 and put a @s on the table|pg||
nt|serhat: and very keen on good bridge|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: A roller-coaster hand|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|benjent:  always tough to bid 3NT on this kind of hand|pg||
