mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  quite common to play 2@c Landy (majors) and rest natural in some circles|pg||
nt|jbgood: a kib suggests that it may be showing @ds and @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzxv: no alert|pg||
nt|jbgood: but since no alert, prob just @ds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with the @hK onside and trumps 2-2, declarer shoudl make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzxv: south thinking a long time|pg||

nt|mikeirl: welcome back|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello everyone!|pg||
nt|sybarra: David Greenwood, West is one of our fellow commentators |pg||
nt|pfbr: hi all|pg||
nt|toobad: 3nt by E/W here|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome|pg||
nt|toobad: preferable to 4 @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello again John and all |pg||
nt|paulg:  Good morning everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: good morning Sandie, Ralf, Paul|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Greetings!   :)|pg||
nt|pfbr: morning all :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Hi folks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mikeirl: Hi Jystin|pg||
nt|toobad: flat game in any event|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning all :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|milton_se: fit jump, it seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s is a nice contract on EW|pg||
nt|idc: Sime & Matheson remain in this room from the first half, playing 15-17 and 5 card majors, basically natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Jones/Jones play Acol, Sime/Matheson play 5-card majors, strong notrump|pg||
mb|3S|nt|justin c: 4@h is where you want to be|pg||
nt|justin c: but not so easy to figure that out|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C = 11+ nat|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Just caught up. will enter final result:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Geoff |pg||
nt|toobad: afternoon Geoff|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: definitely the hot seat........like a sauna in here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Burns asking questions of 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: err  is that right?|pg||
nt|sybarra: in Philly,  I was in the "freezer room"   ....players arrived with coats on,  enjoy the heat |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|milton_se: trumps 3-2, no drama|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 5@C cheaper than 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not if NS can find their @s ruff|pg||
nt|idc: Joined by SHields & Denning playing a strong club system, also with a 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think Sime will bid 4@s here, which will give Daffyd Jones an interesting problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can W find 4@d?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: but this can go down|pg||
nt|athene: would 4nt be general takeout now?|pg||
nt|athene: having limited his hand with 4@H |pg||
nt|athene: it can't really be blackwood|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: Northern Ireland needs more "swingy" bds |pg||
nt|idc: Good morning Bill, and everyone|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  best defence will take this down 3 ... and they are on the road to that|pg||
nt|idc: Harder once East opened 1NT, not that I disagree with his choice|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pfbr: swingy in their direction :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes indeed|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi John|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is a disadvantage keeping a 5-card major when opening 1nt|pg||
nt|idc: A start like: 1@s 2@d 4@d would get the job done a lot more easily|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rmb1: Sorry 2@C = clubs INV+ or other GF, 2@D relay|pg||
nt|justin c: i should have more faith|pg||
nt|mikeirl: S attack best|pg||
nt|justin c: imagined that N would try harder to play in @C|pg||
nt|toobad: this should be off a trick in each suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|justin c: knows he is being forced if @H trumps, but the short hand taking the tap in @C|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very easy to get the two diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Seems as a flatty. 120 tr|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10 tr|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the necessity of making one more trick for game may have influenced his thinking|pg||
nt|rmb1: Trumps 3-3 makes this easy in practice but not before some agonising|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Jones asking system|pg||
nt|toobad: Hi Robin|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: the only big hurdle was finding the opening lead|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rmb1: North doesn't need @HA for opening bid.  But declarer has got it right|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|athene: it's not totally trivial because sometimes with that sort of holding you have to attack one of your suits and use the @DA to get in to cash them|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|sT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|idc: Not very friendly to be doubling the first contract of the day|pg||
nt|athene: cashing the @DA at trick 1 does hold some risk of giving away a vital tempo, setting up a side suit for declarer|pg||
nt|idc: But at least it will blow the sleep out of declarer's eyes|pg||
nt|athene: oops|pg||
nt|paulg:  the other danger of cashing the @dA is that partner will not read it|pg||
mc|12|nt|idc: Though I confess I've been known to try a psychic 1NT with the South hand opposite a passed partner  *blush*|pg||
pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  checked board 32 with Deep Finesse - 3NT is down after the heart lead 0 makabel on any other lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxv: Sorry +2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|yorkbeach:  a natural 2NT overcall - even rather than the natural 2@d overcall eralire|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  was 3@d a transfer?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|galadriel: 2 routes to the same contract|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|galadriel: According to their cc, 3@D was a transfer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer may do well here to cash both hearts before playing any more clubs so that North cannot discard a heart|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d8|nt|yorkbeach:  putting in the jack or ten looks normal |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have done better to throw a heart|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s2|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might actually make this now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  just has to guess which red card to ruff|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not too hard if he remembers the transfer|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i guess it's quick run through|pg||
nt|mikeirl: assume there was more to the bidding than recorded :)|pg||
nt|steveray: saves time opening with the best contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: both pairs play strong NT and 5 card majors|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thats one way of retaining trump control :)|pg||
nt|justin c: temporarily, anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least your fingers move|pg||
nt|toobad: 6c here, but hard to bid|pg||
nt|athene: south wasn't in on the plot?|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for Scotland|pg||
nt|athene: no way north is leading a random @DA there, with both other side suits known to be held|pg||
nt|athene: definitely south's fault i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: NS may not bid on first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: S for a opening? Y|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting hands:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
nt|athene: west has a lot more club support than you normally have when partner opens 4|pg||
nt|athene: but the rest of his hand says defend...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime planning to double 4@s or take the save?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|rmb1: Have to avoid losing two spades in 4@H but defence may establish @CQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry just catching up|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ok|pg||
nt|steveray: hard to see this making|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  3NT is harder|pg||
nt|sybarra: S may enter the bidding this round|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Feel NS are in trouble|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes. D lead shoul beat |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the end of 3NT then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would like the see the bidding, i cant understand why they arent in 4@H|pg||
nt|steveray: assuming East opened 1@C South should not take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c "natural", ostensibly 5+ clubs and a major or 6+ clubs with enough to open the bidding|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh boy ...................|pg||
nt|toobad: a bit frisky by S at the vulnerability..|pg||
nt|athene: neither, i would think|pg||
nt|idc: will sime dbl?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he might double|pg||
nt|idc: continuing from last set, where first 4 hands (at both tables) were all dbld contracts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2@c from W in this situaton|pg||
nt|idc: East has added a point, now West may add a point or two and ... it may end in tears|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|toobad: 2nt now??|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: y :)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|dburn: but being in third position at favourable is enough to open the bidding nowadays|pg||
nt|mrt2000: trouble here|pg||
nt|idc: North wondering if it is time to unsheath the axe|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@C = nat, limited (6+ or 5C+4M)|pg||
nt|sybarra: havent gotten to card yet, is is some form of flannery?  (I may get killed for mentioning that word) |pg||
nt|toobad: a @H lead ducked by S woud have been really unpleasant for declarer|pg||
nt|toobad: short and sweet|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a discussion every partnership needs to have,  is 2 @D forcing by passed hand?  (I think not,  cue bid only force) |pg||
nt|idc: Beimg Aceless on this sort of auction is a minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: won't be happy |pg||
nt|pfbr: :(|pg||
nt|mrt2000: happier than if doubled!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: N must have seen his partner's overcalls before|pg||
nt|toobad: 3c from Ian is v tame|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: E? Who have the rest of the pints?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Could have been a interestin 6@D if opp was 1-3 at @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for North to act with all but one of his points in opponents suits|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for South - best is probably not to shift to spades, but it looks an obvious defence to follow|pg||
nt|idc: and holding KJx in partner's suit an even bigger minus for doubling|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards W can take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|idc: I suspect he wants to take a number of @d ruffs in hand, shorten trumps|pg||
nt|idc: not that he has many entries to dummy but North may be forced into helping him|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  i disagree with Sime's strategy here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  either bid 5@c on the first round or pass/double 4M|pg||
nt|idc: Puts more pressure on opponents to bid 5@c straightaway, yes|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Second best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes Ruff and play a @h to dummy, ruff a @d, take @hA and exit with @cA and a @cx|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzxa: N thinking...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on that lead, this may only go 1 off|pg||
nt|milton_se: he might have feared that 4S was playable|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: and down we go |pg||
nt|idc: North may stretch to bid over 5@c with some shape|pg||
nt|idc: Easy for me to say that - North holding @cKQ so that South cannot easily get on lead isn't easy for declarer to know|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|milton_se: 2C overcall doesn't contain five spades very often ...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Fin|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|paulg:  yes, i think 5@c immediately is likely to be best|pg||
nt|athene: south will try to cater for 5 spades and @DK with partner|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: as well as just the two aces cashing|pg||
nt|athene: so he lays down the @DA first to see what partner has to say about that|pg||
nt|idc: or if North passes, a second dbl from South is a bit undefined as to how takeout-ish it is|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|milton_se: East may still think it's making :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|idc: -1 was possible but -2 seems likely now|pg||
nt|diumraid: *** Live Overall Scores - CAMROSE *** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then "browse results" then 1o3.txt  *****|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: well, he followed it - but declarer didn't have any diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: and this has helped him keep control of the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: to the extent that if he can guess hearts, he will actually make|pg||
nt|rmb1: or discard a heart and ensure -1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrt2000: not now  :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H was both majors,  5-10 pts |pg||
nt|ralfwil: it was a mistake from W not to ruff @dK|pg||
nt|idc: Hmm, if he plays a @c now I wonder if it matters what North does - would North ruffing cost a trick?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rmb1: Just +2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|toobad: 3 off|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|galadriel: nat or 0-8|pg||
nt|galadriel: alot of their bids have 2 way meanings|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  did the 1NT rebid promise such a good hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  NS appear to have done well to stay out of game with the misfitting 25 HCP|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though they have broken Burn's rule|pg||

nt|athene: and another 4minor opener :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@d at this vul|pg||
nt|athene: of course he might not be able to make it (he might play silly artificial 4minor openers or something)|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: @CK lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: possible to make -- but I wouldn't like to be here :)|pg||
nt|idc: The N-S 1@d is < 16 hcp, bal or unbalanced with either minor|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|paulg:  although Sime could hardly be worse and you'd expect to make 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Interesting. Need @H lead for stop a 6er|pg||

nt|rodal f: Have one chance more|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: he might - the cards are fairly well disposed|pg||
nt|toobad: started with 12 finished with 10|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5422 with a trump trick is not at all a hard decision in my view|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@S=force|pg||
nt|insia1: will they go to slam ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C allowing partner to judge what to do over 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hJ on side  in 6@c|pg||
nt|milton_se: there|pg||
nt|sybarra: anderson showing good judgement, as much as he would like to be in red game|pg||
nt|idc: 2@d is I think a relay for a game-forcing North hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: 3@d alerted by shields but not denning|pg||
mb|3H|nt|justin c: can subsequently promote @S10|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3@D showed a @H suit here|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT = 16+ BAL|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: but 5@H is cold on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rmb1: And NS judged to give up quietly ?|pg||
nt|justin c: if dec ducks trick 1, needs @h underlead later|pg||
nt|justin c: bit easier from where we are sitting|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: 6@C to come|pg||
nt|toobad: 6c is a great contract|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, South would be on lead on this auction of course|pg||
nt|idc: I supose a @s from South would also do|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And the @C blowed away after the invit 3@D|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 10 or 11 tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Meddy:)|pg||
nt|steveray: North needs partner to play a club before the D@s are set up|pg||
nt|steveray: Diamonds that is|pg||
nt|dburn: one of these days, the English will lead trumps when declarer actually has some diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no great matter against a part score|pg||
nt|rmb1: Less good opposite 3442|pg||
nt|idc: "relay" isn't quite the right term (he said, wearing his pedants hat) but we know what the CC means|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|idc: Can't complain to the dealing machine so far; these first few hands fun|pg||
nt|athene: declarer trying to get something going - set up a spade is almost impossible but you might set up a black-suit squeeze if the defence are very sleepy|pg||
nt|idc: Quite a bit of work to do here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: well done erichsen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: but will south lead @C?|pg||
nt|steveray: might the @D be a singleton?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: odds on to|pg||
nt|rmb1: North can afford to be passive, but this is the most direct approach.  Hopefully 4@C bid will reap its rewards now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might take his partner for a singleton @D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer would not allow @DK to win if he had the ace|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hopefully selway will work that out|pg||
nt|justin c: is the West hand not worth a strong @C opening?|pg||
nt|justin c: seen worse|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe they dont get to game even then|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|insia1: good bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make S hand as main and nwxt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe|pg||
nt|steveray: might expect the finesse to win|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he did |pg||
nt|paulg:  ruffing with the @d9 only tells the opponents that the @d8 might be an entry .. does not matter here, but careless talk can often cost|pg||
nt|idc: West has led the unbid suit (assuming as I suspect that 3@d is natural), and looks good for defence|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: click on the partnership, to see the convention card|pg||
nt|egezzer: West is John Greenwood,Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe club lead ...after alert, which may have been "could be 2" |pg||
nt|idc: I should warn specs that comparisons may take some time to trickle through - other room still on their first board|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pfbr: david greenwood|pg||
nt|idc: and since they start with 15 & 16, they won't reach Bd 1 for a while|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker and Short then, not the Outreds, in the other room|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: the strong variety of 1@c has a higher lower bound for Carrot players than for Precision players|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|insia1: I think he will drop @C, after finess @D|pg||
nt|idc: indeed|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pfbr: (JTR) on bbo|pg||
nt|rmb1: Like scores at http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|toobad: +4 after the lead|pg||
nt|idc: Tough hands this type: neither declarer & dummy nor the defenders' hands have any communications between them|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rmb1: Temptation with 2-suiters is to open 1suit nat if possible to get your suits over quickly|pg||

pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: Just what we would expect from the winners of the Premier league|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normal? But who chares?|pg||
nt|insia1: well, mantap|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idc: Declarer now wondering if he has anything better than @dA onside & @s 3-3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|steveray: well done|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: @dA on side and 3.-3 in @s.....|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|rmb1: open room started at board 15, so we will see comparisons when they complete board 1, etc.|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite sure why he made only three|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps to reassure his partner that they had not missed a game|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sorry bad light some cards incorrect|pg||
nt|toobad: that always feels bad, even when it isnt|pg||

nt|athene: looks reasonable, if not exactly mandatory|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice hand for South but these strong 4441s often tricky to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A coffe board to come it seems|pg||
nt|idc: Wales also opened 1NT on Bd 17, so no slam bid in other room either: 1 IMP to Scotland|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rmb1: par looks like 4M-1 over 4@C=|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhapsS |pg||
nt|steveray: S might try 3NT|pg||

nt|mikeirl: snap!|pg||
nt|steveray: or will ask for a @S stop|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will NS get into the auction on this one? |pg||
nt|mrt2000: David must be getting bored  .......  :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only -1 in 5@c on board 1. Defence must have sipped|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of our fellow commentators with great analysis and even greater sense of humor (imo)|pg||

nt|sybarra: 2 @D= multi|pg||
nt|athene: they're easier when opps bid your singleton :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, east didn't oblige :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: I would have opened at Ws hand. 1@S 110 by 100 times|pg||
nt|dburn: well, one of them will|pg||
nt|dburn: probably the one with the spades|pg||
nt|dburn: ah - the support double!|pg||
nt|dburn: now what on Earth, I wonder, is East supposed to do with that?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Support XX from North ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry slipped...|pg||
nt|egezzer: I fully agree with you. And excellent player actually|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson would want a better suit, or worse hand, to open 1@c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on ew with that nice @c situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: on board 17 Wales have been allowed to play in 3nt where the Jones found the good 4S save against it|pg||
nt|athene: east must be a bit worried about the hearts now|pg||
nt|athene: that might stop him balancing|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: :) 100 by 100|pg||
nt|steveray: non scientific|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@D = Ms constructive|pg||

nt|idc: Tough spot for West now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: 2@D game force I precume|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  1 NS's decision to play in 4@H rather than 5@C was worth an IMP to England|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully anderson "hits the deck" |pg||
nt|sybarra: (aka passes)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: he can make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: it ought to have been worth more than that - 5@c was down off the top|pg||
nt|athene: yes, a pity that the one time in a hundred years a real blue club 2@D comes up, and the person holding the hand isn't playing blue club :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As W I had used a straight forward 3@d instead of 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Though I could have been worse: he might be in 4@s with AKX opposite xxxx :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and easy for E to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|idc: No one likes to jump rebid their suit these days - seems to have got devalued by people doing it on 15 counts|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: The X from S could have costed 800|pg||

nt|rmb1: 2@D is a weak multi 0-7 (2M is 8-11)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime might bid a weak 2@s now?|pg||
nt|idc: Huge board for Wales on 18 : same 3@s dbld that went -2 here was allowed to make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rmb1: 4@D splinter (?)|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT now?|pg||
nt|dburn: more or less forced|pg||
nt|dburn: would like to double for penalty, of course, but...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  18 in open, South could open 3@C = both minors, weak|pg||
nt|athene: he's a disciplined fellow obviously - he'll wait until he has that @SJ :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: a reason the Hogg does not bid 1 sp?|pg||
nt|toobad: not the sort of board NI require when searching for imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  it may not be an option of course|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would have some other way to bid the north hand, to show the big support right away - 3@D perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: this might be a semi-psychic ploy, trying to buy the contract more cheaply|pg||
nt|idc: I like to call hands like North's a mixed raise: 3@d showing something between a preemptive raise & vaule raise|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, 3@d often a mixed raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: "South could" in the sense that South was able to open|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: +1|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that rather woeful defence to two spades on board 18 appears not to have mattered very much|pg||

mb|p|nt|milton_se: brakes|pg||
nt|idc: Hey, we have the beginnings of partnership harmony here!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mikeirl: unusual lead of Q@H - wud normally be asking to unblock the J|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think they stop in game |pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" zoomed passed that|pg||
nt|toobad: NI have bid the club slam on board 19|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: East asking questions|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer ruffed @dK at trick one (better than line here)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: not that unusual - plenty of pairs play that the king asks for count or unblock, the queen or ace for attitude|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pfbr: yes|pg||
nt|egezzer: indeed|pg||
nt|toobad: cant see more than 5 being bid|pg||
nt|pfbr: i'm just optimistic :)|pg||
nt|egezzer: :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S will surely be found by some EW pairs|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s would be a fair save even when you get the spades wrong, so chances of a welsh pickup|pg||
nt|athene: even with the horrible misfit in the side suits (three club losers, @DKQ wasted) it is ok|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have ten hearts and you have ten spades it just can't be wrong to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding 1@s is fine when this is their hand and you need to suggest a save|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|toobad: about the weather??|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: this wont long to play |pg||
nt|toobad: 50 up.......... not a time for punting!!|pg||

nt|rmb1: And another 10 to England on  19, making 10 tricks when they needed to in 4@S|pg||
nt|idc: North had to either lead trumps or give dummy the established @dQ for a heart pitch in declarer's hand|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|mrt2000: another 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi  (strong bid coming) |pg||
nt|toobad: another 3nt but EW this time|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rodal f: We welcome Paul. Hi:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why 4@D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT won't make for NS here either|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Selway has 2 nice cards but will pass probably|pg||
nt|steveray: pass looks right NV|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S  was David's guess  that pard's suit was spades if the weak hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c not described on the CC probably just meaning gf|pg||
nt|hedyg: t/o double purely showing shape, not force|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok opposite a PH pd who is not supposed to hang you|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: hi :)|pg||
nt|insia1: another partscore|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another 3nt|pg||
mb|3N|nt|idc: An uneventful 3NT it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@D might better and u have space to find info|pg||
nt|sybarra: also saying,  I have a better hand in hts, and prepared to play at least 3 @H  (if weak version)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Lindsay asking 2 c cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: no dobl from e|pg||
nt|steveray: thinks it is @C+@H??|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does he think 4@C is a 2 suited hand?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does South think it is non-leaping michaels?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
nt|athene: east might think he is facing a 2-suiter, now, and bid 4@D rather than 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: seems like 8 tricks |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think he does|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@S lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be rapidly off|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: only 50s|pg||
nt|steveray: else he thought it was Gerber|pg||
nt|steveray: just joking|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT = GF raise of M (at least by unpassed hand)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: i bet you dont even play Gerber Steve!|pg||
nt|sybarra: round about way of explaining here |pg||
nt|athene: if west really did have 5-6 reds, then east's hand would be very good for things like 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: with the black aces and diamond fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  the West hand is interesting ... many now use 2@c with a gf balanced hand so that 2@d promises five|pg||
nt|paulg:  however, bidding your second weakest suit is not always ideal|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that is much the best i think - garozzo advocated that for a long time with artificial continuations over 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: people are generally starting to catch up with him|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pitnor: d3-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can beat it |pg||
nt|paulg:  a bit to do here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have a restricted choice dilemma in diamonds at some point|pg||
nt|idc: Matheson will spend some time but all the cards lie well for him|pg||
nt|athene: (cash ace and king, dropping a big one from north, and then you have to decide whether to finesse the nine)|pg||
nt|paulg:  not sure he'll have the entries to worry about it|pg||
nt|idc: True, and at that point he may well know North has 4 @s, making 4-2 @d a little more likely|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|idc: or an eventful 6NT but that's not really likely :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: win this trick and go for spades seems normal|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: Say he wins this, spade finesse & duck, or immediate duck - later wins, test spades and then has to guess @d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|steveray: not often - I only get weak hands|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|toobad: 6d has chances on a non H lead|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|rmb1:  20 flat in 3@S-1.  McGann bid 3@S a couple of rounds earlier than Liggins|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually safety= ruff this and play A@D|pg||
nt|idc: Best for defence probably @c switch now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: I'm the only one in Manchester who likes Gerber|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but not here |pg||
nt|steveray: nothing wrong with it|pg||
nt|athene: many people would lead a spade to the queen but even if the suit lies as well as it possibly can, you have to lose one, so you might as well take the deep finesse|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rmb1: West and South know something went wrong, but what about East|pg||
nt|steveray: so how many down?|pg||
nt|idc: if they continue @h, declarer can set up a long spade to the heartless North|pg||
nt|athene: you don't especially need two fast spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: agree,  |pg||
nt|hedyg: :) sry Geoff|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to duck again this should be routine |pg||

mb|p|nt|toobad: 2s or 3c|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: if you want to watch other tables as well: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: On  21, NS made 3NT after a small diamond opening lead to @D10 |pg||
nt|athene: aggressive 3@H makes it very easy for south now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzxa: akhmad said that 1@s must be 4cd, if he had 5cd @s he would bid 1nt|pg||
nt|steveray: on board 3 Ireland were pushed to 5@H - but it made for 8 imps|pg||
nt|rmb1: Presumably West thinking|pg||
nt|justin c: 800 odd on offer here|pg||
nt|dburn: wondering how short his partner is in diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play it here,  |pg||
nt|idc: South worth a slam try I feel, but presumably North will decline to cooperate being (sub) minimum|pg||
nt|athene: there is a case for starting hands like that south (game force, balanced) with 2@C rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: depends on your subsequent methods but it can be easier if you set up the game force first|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may not get the chance to decline|pg||
nt|athene: of course you have to be playing 2@C as GF :)|pg||
nt|athene: south must drive to slam after 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: surely?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@D = 4414|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rmb1: or 4441 or similar 5440s|pg||
nt|paulg:  6@h is not a great contract, needing a finesse and 3-2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose no heart honour is a bit of a worry|pg||
nt|idc: I wouldn't drive, but I'd make a couple of tries|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: light double by W showing minors|pg||

mb|p|nt|pitnor: as the card lays 3 n is ok but probably 4s ....-1|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not now ....................|pg||
nt|milton_se: not this way|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will make now!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s was the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Hmm, maybe that would be wet of me ... wouldn't blame anyone for just blasting|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and electing to try for slam in spades|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5@H by West op?|pg||
nt|toobad: no defence to these slams|pg||
nt|rmb1: Efficiently bid,  but I bet East thinks the singleton isnt the A and West has more in hearts/clubs|pg||
nt|toobad: indeed....... he'll fret about the H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Burns would make a gd croupier|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Surpricing but good decision          this time for NS|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C = 3+, 1NT may be limited to 14, 2@D looks artificial and then we are guessing :)|pg||
nt|chick: a good lead that doesn't give anything away, although N was kinda forced into it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pitnor: y...need to guess dia ...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: 2@D  new minor forcing|pg||
nt|steveray: N/S will reach 3NT and can make it with a good guess|pg||
nt|toobad: too dangerous to double at imps|pg||
nt|toobad: has he a fluffy tail??|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: you might not need the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: leading from Jxxx isnt popular but what's the alternative?|pg||
nt|rmb1: @D lead requires declarer to drop @CQ|pg||
nt|idc: Not sure the threats work for a squeeze|pg||
nt|paulg:  i will be pleasantly surprised if Short/Walker bid this|pg||
nt|athene: @SA lead (ok unlikely) or perhaps lead a spade to the queen and then duck spades and ruff down west's short ace|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mikeirl: I favour defense on D lead|pg||
nt|steveray: looks 50/50 to me|pg||
nt|athene: or lead the @S6 from hand and east flies in with his ace, scared you have a singleton|pg||
nt|idc: Ahh, missed the @sA dropping|pg||
nt|athene: so many luscious possibilities :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|steveray: clear the @Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot double|pg||
nt|chick: declarer can easily find his 9th trick in hearts|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  22 East did not open but stil played in 2@S -1|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|steveray: then cash an AK befor finessing in the other black suit|pg||
nt|milton_se: reasonable choice though, since North i more likely to have QS|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Hard to find, but @HJ is best def|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Did. WD|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|justin c: perhaps East's pass over 5@D was encouraging West to bid on here|pg||
nt|idc: Gives defenders a chance to signal for @d but no big deal I guess|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idc: May have been right to play a @s immediately though, entries a bit sticky to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: he's a bit short of entries to try the spade to the queen line, so i think @S6 from hand is coming|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: but you are better to try that really early, before east knows the trumps are solid|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to go in with his ace if there is the possibility his partner has a trump trick|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Still. Non vul u don'nt earn as much as u do at vul.    As long as 3@S seemed invitational|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  4 it looks as if NS found their @S stop for 3NT and still lost the first five @Hs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|steveray: the club finesse looks to be wrong now|pg||
nt|rmb1: Black suit squeeze for +1 :) If you don't get deflected into putting in @CJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: well, he can still make on a black suit squeeze on east, unless west returns a club now|pg||
nt|idc: Good in fact: gets us on to next hand more quickly :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|idc: This line isn't unreasonable: some small squeeze chances with @d finesse in reserve but fails as cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: @SK, spade ruff to isolate the threat, cash the @DAK, run the trumps|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|yorkbeach:  in a match this tight, evry IMP could count!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: I don't think I want to learn a system where you must open 1@D with that South hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1NT is going a lot down but unlikley to be the final contract|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  does NS system really not allow them to bid a club suit like this?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 1NT shows clubs|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D did not show diamonds and 1@H did not promise hearts|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||

nt|rmb1: Still needs spades 3-2|pg||

nt|mrt2000: although S will get very busy in @S|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  but a likely gain for Scotland|pg||
nt|idc: The Welsh lead up to a healthy 11 IMPs now but may well drop after the last two boards we have seen here|pg||

nt|pfbr: eh?|pg||

nt|rmb1: NS play 4 card majors but open minor before major, so missed their @H fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, this is going to be less difficult to play|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'm told board 6 will probably be flat and not 3 imps to Wales|pg||

nt|athene: will east start with the @DA? or queen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But if E opened 1@H   S would pass and W bid 2@H for pass around I belive|pg||

nt|egezzer: Camrose Live Results : http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  |pg||
nt|paulg:  many of them also play in the BBO InterCity League|pg||
mb|1S|nt|toobad: 4H looks handy|pg||
nt|rmb1: If West opens 1NT he might play there|pg||
mb|d|nt|justin c: had 10 there|pg||
nt|athene: how many diamonds now?|pg||
nt|athene: 3, 4 or 5?|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d|pg||
nt|athene: 5 looks too many; 3 looks a bit wet|pg||
nt|idc: South's reward for disciplined pass is not going to please him I suspect - 3@d or even more?|pg||
nt|athene: 4 is the goldilocks bid|pg||
mb|r|nt|steveray: the 1NT opening will get them to @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: with poor results|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that bid will annoy Carroll :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes south should obviously have opened 2@S to keep his partner from getting ideas|pg||
nt|chick: XX by N to show values|pg||
nt|idc: After North redbls, be interesting to see East's action|pg||
nt|idc: pass looks right: let partner choose for now since you have the higher suits|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rmb1: EW got there (@Hs) first :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: E might have bid 4@d with a singleton or void|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Goodman pondering|pg||
nt|paulg:  why bid 4@d when three wins the pot|pg||
nt|chick: modern style is to pass with the E hand, but I really hate that ... I think W has already said he doesn't know what suit to bid, so E should ALWAYS tell him when possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: forcing NT, I believe|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a hand like that south, it's pretty rare that you will make more tricks in hearts than in spades, even if partner has a heart fit|pg||
nt|idc: I expect Dbl from East would have been takeout - Matheson a little fixed with his actual hand|pg||
nt|idc: N-S playing strong @c, so 1@s more understandable since limited to 16 - I expect some other will preempt|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: west can reopen with a good hand and doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  true Bill, but partner would not expect such playing strength from a weak two|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd rather open 1@s than 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: is this double penalty?|pg||
nt|steveray: does South know?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think so, after South has described his hand|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, seems it showed @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: corrected on movie|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Power at E? Why not use 2NT at the road?|pg||
nt|chick: I'm afraid I would always open S hand 1@S, 29 zarpoints, only need 26 to open|pg||
nt|idc: Note the 3@s bid made immediately: normal is to jump with great shape (sub)minimums and pass then jump with full value openings|pg||
pc|h4|nt|steveray: could be game try|pg||
nt|dburn: 11 IMPs to Ireland when Erichsen and Selway tried a slam that was not likely to make given the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trumph lead from S?|pg||
nt|toobad: the c position saves this, i think|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: and sure enough, the bloke who bid a lot of spades had the king of them, so the finesse lost|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: is this the way you would start this play?  |pg||
nt|toobad: no, but has he caught a fish?|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play this one slower|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: only if playing with Mcgann:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|cA|nt|milton_se: this won't be easy|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: maybe Erichsen didnt see the first X|pg||
nt|athene: when you have to launch KJ109xxx(x) from hand, you normally lead the king, because the only chance to escape for one loser is to snare a singleton queen, but here even that would ...|pg||
nt|athene: not help north, as he would still lose two trumps to the A87xx|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rmb1: West able to double 3@H and 4@H for penalties |pg||
nt|rmb1: and he wasn't on opening lead to lead one :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT was a better idea than this|pg||
nt|rmb1: How about 4NT to play|pg||
nt|justin c: what could possibly go wrong :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it'll make though, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 10 in OR the slam was bid and made, so new leaders|pg||
pc|s2|nt|steveray: doubles are never penalty these days|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mikeirl: 5@c may make - not easy to find @D lead|pg||
nt|justin c: needs a @D lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzxy: east is contemplative|pg||

nt|ralfwil: @hK!|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||

nt|diumraid: While you are all frozen you can follow scores Live ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|toobad: 7h against the roof|pg||
nt|rmb1: Sorry folks.  Thanks to operator Geoff and fellow commentator John.  Thanks to CBAI for organising the event and BBO for organising us|pg||
nt|toobad: thanks all................ nite|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or?|pg||
nt|dburn: that might not get a heart lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: might be coming back here though|pg||
nt|athene: both north and south have borderline decisions here|pg||
mb|2C!|an|forces 2!d|nt|dburn: or then again...|pg||
nt|rmb1: wd|pg||
nt|dburn: Whittaker perhaps thought that Carroll was taking an advance save|pg||
nt|dburn: so his double was just penalty, not Lightner|pg||
nt|justin c: if one of East's @h were a @C would have 12 here|pg||
nt|paulg:  three small diamonds a concern|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: surely NOT 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way Goodman bid 3@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: with this hand we see here?|pg||
nt|toobad: no pay increase for you this year, Geoff!!|pg||
mb|2D|an|a|mb|p|nt|athene: they both vaguely want to bid something but neither has the perfect hand|pg||
mb|2N|an|invite|nt|idc: Not a bad 6-loser hand East has: would anyone be tempted by a 3@h rebid?|pg||
nt|paulg:  but operation successful, at least in pushing them up|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: very low scores in all the matches, does that mean flat hands or brilliant bridge?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: K@H I hope ..............|pg||
nt|pfbr: me too|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would he bid 3@s with 7 flat hcps and no fit?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd rebid 3@h in a strong club system, or if playing gadgets like gazzilli|pg||
nt|idc: I must be getting old, was sure gazzilli was a soup|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rmb1: not very flat, not necessarily brilliant|pg||
nt|mrt2000: YES !!!|pg||
nt|pfbr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: fished swiftly out it was|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: perhaps @h9 then @h5 might have been better suit preference for clubs but not trivial to suggest that suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxy: Will fix 13 later|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|idc: For preference I'd mini-splinter the East hand with 3@c, but 3@h otherwise|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson a big fan, trying to persuade Sime ... not on their card but I know they've been practising it over major openings|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer doesn't know both red suits are breaking|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|toobad: okedoke|pg||
nt|idc: 10 then 9 suggests diamonds, 10 then 5 neutral, maybe that will be East's explanation|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: @H better from W?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make them play NT as good as u can|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now @D is to late|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: @H?     Sorry ment @D|pg||
nt|athene: so he is thinking about 4-2 diamonds and 4-1 trumps|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|milton_se: you don't seem very neutral, Paul :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrt2000: well spotted!|pg||
nt|diumraid: *** Live Overall Scores - CAMROSE *** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then "browse results" then 1o3.txt  *****|pg||
nt|athene: north knows the diamonds are running so just playing trumps to stop the club ruffs isn't going to work|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|steveray: lead has helped declarer, why not stiff @s?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|hedyg: there goes the other @s loser|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|idc: Ireland & England beginning to pull away from opponents in the other 2 matches|pg||
nt|idc: now lying 1st & 2nd, so normal service resumed : http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
nt|chick: or maybe E just didn't think hard about what the signal might mean|pg||
pc|c8|nt|steveray: no guarantee of a trick with Qxx trumps|pg||
nt|athene: but basically nothing is going to work :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|hedyg: there was no way to avoid that though|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d6|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: i wonder how Thomas knew to bid 4@c, when did Goodman deny 5@ss?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: It is for them because 1@C can be 11-13 balanced|pg||

nt|mrt2000: difficult to be dispassionate when commentating on two very good friends!   :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Geoff :)|pg||
nt|idc: Now we have reached the last 2 bds of the set, that the Open room played earlier|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mikeirl: 3nt makesas  H 4-4|pg||
nt|athene: south lightner doubled and got his spade ruff but didn't then underlead for a second ruff|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Well payed at OR. I see 8 as the minimum|pg||
nt|idc: Now that we have reached last 2 boards, we see the scores from other room who played them earlier|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: Note that against 4@h dbld, Short led @s3 for Walker to ruff, but then Walker cashed @cA when he needed to underlead @c honours|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: imo b15 and 16 well for Timah A so pk Liliek not to win this|pg||
nt|rmb1: Ireland retake the lead by bidding and making 3NT+1 on  29|pg||
nt|dburn: North deciding that he has a three-card limit raise in hearts rather than a spade suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: last 2 hands here for this set |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Another guess the outcome?|pg||
nt|idc: Not like Outreds to miss a 22 count 3NT but well judged this time :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you all open on S? not for me in vul|pg||
nt|chick: never|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rodal f: A @H lead give 9|pg||
nt|idc: I used to playing 14-16 NT, since these sequences showed 11-13, but having them show 11-14 is too much, so would pass playing 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 24 zarpoints, need 26 to open|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1@S walsh style, does not deny longer @D with < GF.  |pg||
nt|athene: he can put the @C9 on this perhaps to get one ruff |pg||
mb|d|nt|toobad: screaming for a h lead here|pg||
nt|hedyg: what good was bidding 2@D if you are going to bid 3NT no matter what?|pg||
nt|idc: the dbl was good in that it helped North to get off to right lead, but bad when contract made anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: why on earth 1@s?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thanks to our terrific operator,    great job! |pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad 11 points ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: That lead should ensure +2|pg||
nt|toobad: thats my boy!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: small= encouraging|pg||
nt|athene: depends on their agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: oh yuk|pg||
nt|chick: and N is getting carried away because he thinks his partner has something|pg||
nt|idc: Trying to think of how I'd play dbl here - think I'd like a little more defence to clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead is needed here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: no?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|steveray: might as well bid 3NT now:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT relay (?)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: and thx to my fellow commentators. |pg||
nt|toobad: has just got worse for Ni|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|steveray: sad when you can't bid a lovely 6 bagger like that|pg||
nt|idc: a pretty close dbl - looks like a trump switch needed now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: should just make this, lose 2@H and 2@S|pg||
nt|steveray: yes, Kath, should make, but I hate it:)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|toobad: thx all|pg||
nt|toobad: tell me that is an undo Geoff|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzxy: no|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting choice of @s3 lead rather than @s2 in other room|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|idc: declarer will make 4 trumps, 2 @s and I guess only 1 red winner (not enough time to develop 2)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|idc: With a @d in the bag, East now has time to set about hearts|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: but may not lose 2@c tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: silly to bid  3NT and watch them cash 5@H tricks |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: we will be back in 7:10 am Los Angeles, 10:10 am New York, 16.10 Paris, 3:10 pm London|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live Overall Scores - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu then "browse" results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|hedyg: CC says reverse attitude|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: perhaps neutral as to suit preference for a return>?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|steveray: Not uggesting they should bid 3NT, 3@d is the contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: "silly" is relative,  Some would say declarer Axxx/xxx instead of KQJxxx/Ax was silly |pg||
nt|sybarra: or just about 1 hours |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps @s2 should be led when you have a ace or king of clubs|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|egezzer: thx Shirley|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  or singleton|pg||
pc|h4|nt|idc: agree|pg||
nt|paulg:  i can imagine taking a lot of time to decide what to do, and still not knowing what is best|pg||
nt|athene: he is just trying to work out if there is any way he can make with the @DK wrong|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think there is, though|pg||
nt|athene: he can't quite manage to throw one diamond on the @SK and crossruff enough tricks|pg||
nt|idc: While there's a lull in the action: the second half of the current round of matches continues in 40 mins: 12:20 local time|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's interesting - suppose you go club ruff, @SK throwing diamond, spade ruff, diamond towards dummy|pg||
nt|athene: now if north has the @DK he can rise and play his trump but then the @DQ is good|pg||
nt|paulg:  he will eventually just lead the diamond|pg||
nt|athene: no, it still just needs the diamond right|pg||
nt|athene: because if south could win the @DK he would just play a club forcing dummy and promoting a trick for the @HJ|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|idc: needs to guess hearts now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|s2|nt|egezzer: and John,Anita :)|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|idc: not tough on bidding once North had showed AKJ @d|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|yorkbeach:  only 8 on top - obvious chance of a 9th is to find East with a doubleton honour in one of the black suits but no joy there|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|yorkbeach:  running some diamonds will give the defenders discards to make but also reduce NS entry options|pg||

nt|chick: Next session starts in about 1/2 hour, I believe|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|justin c: 2@H 3 suited, short @D|pg||
nt|idc: Looked at this earlier: 3NT is interesting after East's preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: can we make 3nt?|pg||
nt|pfbr: oh, i do hope so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 10-16 (?)  card does not say|pg||
nt|steveray: see it was S in @s in other room:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: selway pulled a penalty double earler, will he do it again?|pg||
nt|steveray: we used to play that - light years ago, pick your poison, a 4-2 break and no points or a 5-1|pg||
nt|justin c: (like old precision 2@D)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: A new X?|pg||
nt|hedyg: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E will go down with a @s shifr on @hJ and another @s after @hA|pg||
nt|idc: 40 mins I think: 14:55 local time|pg||
pc|h9|nt|justin c: 3@C any min|pg||
nt|rmb1: England retake the lead by avoiding slam on  30|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT not safe here|pg||
nt|justin c: @HJ lead, @D10 switch |pg||
nt|golfsquash: This will be a good gain for England|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrt2000: good lead|pg||
nt|toobad: when opps make that big a boo boo it should be punished|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks Geoff, great job :)|pg||
nt|athene: you build a trick for the @SJ to throw a club from dummy, maybe|pg||
nt|idc: I wondered if West might come under pressure but on some lines they have @cQ exit to recover with|pg||
pc|hA|nt|steveray: but this is not penalty - or is it?|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs predicting 5@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks John :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: tyHedy|pg||
nt|toobad: ditto|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mikeirl: A more effective|pg||
nt|justin c: correctly :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, although West comes under pressure on the trumps anyhow|pg||
nt|idc: And another hassle for declarer is what to pitch from dummy now|pg||
nt|chick: a @D|pg||
nt|idc: That's all there is but means you cannot finish @d ending in dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! I vote for a @s|pg||
nt|chick: keep the black suit options open and decide later what to pitch on the long diamond|pg||
nt|idc: but really I'm probably kidding myself if I think it has much play anyway|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west has to guard all three side-suits, so he is in for a rough time|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy for declarer to place the high cards here :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  sime/matheson more forward in the bidding than their team mates, who would pass the West hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rmb1: He might make this one.  We may even get to see the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: lol|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: I understand N. At OR S was in with 3@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|golfsquash: going down|pg||
nt|rmb1: Just ruff 3 @D in dummy|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|toobad: our thanks to all the specs for your comments|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rmb1: Not enough entries now|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: you are more inclined to pass the west hand at this vulnerability if playing a weak notrump i suppose|pg||
nt|chick: this is kinda useless given that he has no spade to lead toward the 10, but I guess so is everything else :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|toobad: should be a swing to the good guys |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|rmb1: On  11 West bid @H before North could, so NS stayed out of trouble and defended 3D-2 +9 to Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: needed to play @D immediately i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont go far, we will be back for more fun soon!|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|toobad: easy now - overtricks - 10 or 11 in|pg||
nt|chick: oh, not so useless now|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, that @c exit wasn't best|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: draw trumps then do that would have left west endplayed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|golfsquash: yes, had the chance|pg||
nt|toobad: we need more boards - we are hitting our stride now|pg||
