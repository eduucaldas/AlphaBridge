nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/hanlon-mcgann.pdf  EW system card|pg||
nt|garnetts: very interesting hand--who does it belong to?  |pg||
mb|2S|nt|justin c: NS, in theory|pg||
mb|3C|nt|diablo666: Actually 10 in clubs normally just mean that you donÂ´t like the suit, rare with Lavinthal in these positions in Sweden.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is interesting - SUCTION - one suit in @H or two suit @S@C|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/TeddSalisburyCC090918.pdf  NS system card|pg||
nt|rmb1: But are NS English or Welsh?|pg||
nt|justin c: let them bid a bit more :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW have nine tricks in spades and NS 11 in clubs --but not perhaps in hearts |pg||
mb|5C|nt|odysseus69: welcome to this all-ticket confrontation|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Walker is *thinking* in the other room Roland|pg||
nt|justin c: rehi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Website for Camrose resultsm running scores, and other info http://www.cbai.ie/|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: good evening, this is the first CAmrose cap for Willie Hamilton, brother of Ian, we wish him well|pg||
nt|garnetts: South did very well to start with 2@C|pg||
nt|rmb1: Much easier when your suits break 3-2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: NS can make 3N pretty easily|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  pretty similar systems for both pairs, 5-card majors, strong 1NT and three weak 2s|pg||
nt|greerm: Willie has also represented Northern Ireland at fencing in I think the Commonwealth Games|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead J@S is a surprise holding QJ10987 in @H|pg||
nt|justin c: a @h and a @S to lose here|pg||
nt|justin c: who is winning this event lately?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|po-s: EW can sacrifice in 4D or S|pg||
nt|chick: If they think the 3N is making, yes :)|pg||
nt|justin c: saw WBU in the lead for a while yesterday|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: dummy was a disappointment - |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but South think to find a suit better that @H, because his K in @C is very bad after 3@C by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: at least there is no money involved |pg||
nt|odysseus69: with a banced 15 it is normal to bid 3NT over 3D - but sometimes it can lead to a big penalty though not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to find a discard from dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond looks best|pg||
nt|garnetts: would you have expressed an opinion about 3NT Victor ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i am too much of a coward - but you would be there David - what do you think about club king as alternative lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think it best for the usual reasons |pg||
nt|justin c: am told CBAI in the lead by 1 point|pg||

nt|po-s: or think that 4S makes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: the question is: the opps probably have 9 tricks - the lead @H try to beat the contract finding any good layout - the lead @S need to find more cards |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have held this ace up too perhaps |pg||

nt|chick: I look forward to seeing what happens at the other table :)|pg||
nt|justin c: would it not be better to invite another country to join in rather than have two teams from same place?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|mb|5C|nt|bridge_one: yes, open weak NT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: If they were to invite a team from the near continent (France/Netherlands) they would win :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: very difficult slam to reach|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: they are so aggressive that is possible to see 3@H now|pg||
nt|paulg:  normal high level bridge, three passes to you and then no-one passes before your next call|pg||
nt|chick: first they have to get into the bidding|pg||
nt|peachy: Second seat Vul maybe kept Salisbury from opening|pg||
nt|peachy: not unreasonable at all, when the suits are minors|pg||
nt|po-s: if he bids 3C I will leave|pg||
nt|peachy: heh PO|pg||
nt|justin c: isle of man suggested by two kibs|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not at all convinced by that %@C effort --do you think he thought he had no defence |pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@C |pg||
nt|justin c: tho judging by what i saw yesterday, they too might win|pg||
nt|justin c: this lacks aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: I dont know much about the Welsh pair. They will do well to restrainIrelands leading pair|pg||
nt|garnetts: clear cut 3@D bid now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and then 3NT?|pg||
nt|chick: whew!!   we want po to stay!!|pg||
nt|garnetts: quite--why bid over 4@C ?  I think its a sort of reaction bid--failed to think first |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|chessmaste: All five of us!|pg||
nt|peachy: I am happy you can stay now po|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: in money game DBL now for sure |pg||
nt|justin c: quality that counts Mark|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks, I maintain it is a difficult hand to find slam on|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in IMP competition need to be more safe|pg||
nt|justin c: speaking of quality, this 3NT contract lacks it|pg||
nt|justin c: horrible contract, but neither N nor S can remotely put a red card on it|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nothing exceptional here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not clear cut is it?  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  3@c is a brave call as Sime was not guaranteed a fit (Matheson might hold five hearts for example)|pg||
nt|greerm: helpful lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  blame the 2@s bidder|pg||
nt|justin c: so i guess this will just drift several off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very respectful of partners balancing action|pg||
nt|garnetts: Probably done well to pass as 3NT needs the diamond finesse and thats certainly not clearcut |pg||
nt|garnetts: this contrcat needs the same view I suppose too|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am afraid that I would have overcalled with 2@S earlier |pg||
nt|po-s: even without an opening by West|pg||
pc|hA|nt|greerm: when the other 3 suits look dangerous too|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|garnetts: South will just cash three aces in a while--and if I were east i would be thinking of some acerbic comment |pg||
nt|rmb1: South cash out now!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: I think we would all bid this the same way |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|garnetts: have to say a club looks so obvious I wouldn't even think about it |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I would like to be in 3NT - and maybe right to take the diamond finesse|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Now we ned the operator to insert results manually in MOVIE|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I believe he knows how to|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On 17 and 18|pg||
nt|toobad: a vote of confidence for Martin|pg||
nt|paulg:  hopefully Sime will lead the @cK on the replay|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West would have been better to simply raise to 3@D|pg||
nt|justin c: and now, some bridge|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with you Victor--that @D finesse figures to be better than 50% doesn't it |pg||
nt|odysseus69: already I detect that Hogg is giving to much respect to Hanlon McGann|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that is right--I only used to respect players who knew when to double :( |pg||
nt|peachy: this looks like lively hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: snatching defeat from the jaws of victory |pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: or 4@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe 1NT   :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|greerm: hny to  Les too, invisible !!|pg||
nt|peachy: 1C = 11-13 bal or 17+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: will go 4 now i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@s became natural (5@D) - 1@D i suppose can be also 0 @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzxd: 1@D was 10-15, 4+@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry then|pg||
nt|justin c: 6@C is a fun place to be|pg||
nt|justin c: or ... 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: not much to get excited about here|pg||
nt|rmb1: We didn't think of that!|pg||
nt|justin c: was thinking a @S lead will beat 5@H EW|pg||
pc|dK|nt|justin c: where they would presumably play after a higher @D preempt|pg||
nt|garnetts: I had some antiquted idea that a busybody on some laws committee said you could not psyche your sides strong bid--perosnally I would make it compulsory |pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  i'm not sure the Scottish East will bid 2@s, but West may push anyhow|pg||
nt|peachy: at least according to sys card, which was is it :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sheila a: Hallo all|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can find the convention cards for these pairs at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|diana1: hi all and welcome to the first match in this year's Camrose series - the home internationals|pg||
nt|sheila a: South's hand is pretty poor but NV she figured it was worth a pre-empt|pg||
nt|greerm: not a brilliant contract but...|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for anyone except Deep Finesse or GIB to find the @cK lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|garnetts: there is no lead that will do any good here--and a spade costs |pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Lars Andersson|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S are playing strong @C or not ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 12 on spade lead- 11 on rest|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzxd: they are :)|pg||
nt|bt: thx roland, good to be here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 3@S now |pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: I know it is fashionable but I think the opening bid is dreadful |pg||
nt|justin c: no game for EW with the @SK wrong|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|po-s: just forcing probably|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT showed max, either bal or with support|pg||
nt|rmb1: That regulation has been dropped (in England)|pg||
nt|justin c: ive never been clear on what qualifies as psyching your strong bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Let me be clear I would rather chew my own arm off than open with 3@D |pg||
nt|justin c: saw a 2@C opening yesterday on a solid @S suit and not a lot else|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: Hi Lars :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|diablo666: Hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats a pretty well thought out sequence |pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk5: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
nt|po-s: I think he should appreciate his spade doubleton as extra trick value in a club contract|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|bt: it seems skara is still winning, but 2 game swings will put it in jeopardy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chessmaste: Nothing to the play - 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: Being declarer did have some value in protecting his two AQ holdings|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|garnetts: wastes energy thinking here when you know its a spread |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|justin c: after 2@C-2@D-4@S, partner passed and put down an ace and a king etc|pg||
nt|rmb1: opening 2@C (strong, artificial) on South hand would be a psyche|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think we sort of disagreed on that lol --it was EW here that bid it |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: it has almost certainly kept EW low which is to their advantage |pg||
mc|10|nt|garnetts: However-- I would rather bid anyhting than 3@D --its sending a boy on a mans errand in spades |pg||

nt|Walddk4: OK; done|pg||
nt|paulg:  we have seen a lot of two-suiters tonight, perhaps the theme of the weekend|pg||
nt|greerm: 3C+2 by Norht on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: ok we are back! lost the play on 19, sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: well played :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
nt|paulg:  the play on 19 would have been uninteresting, we can live without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: figured as much :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has a clear 3@S opening in my view these 6-4 hands usually play well and the spades are pretty good |pg||
nt|odysseus69: will South double 3 hearts?-|pg||
nt|justin c: nv against vul looks like a 5@D opening to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|1C|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he does willNort pass|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Acol and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|justin c: which might get a huge result if you find a @S lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I absolutely agree|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: yes and about as difficult to make as the last one |pg||
mb|1H|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: If NS get to some number of no-trumps there is a classic intra finesse position in clubs |pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT by N maybe here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
nt|justin c: y indeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S or 3@S Victor?  |pg||
mb|2C|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: double explained as promising 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets see if they can do it in defence |pg||
nt|justin c: close to 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: this will tell us |pg||
nt|odysseus69: the ultra conservative approach continues|pg||
nt|garnetts: I bet he would bid 4@H over 3@S |pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|greerm: seems a simpel 1 off, anyone see anything lese?|pg||
nt|justin c: too early for difficult contracts|pg||

nt|paulg:  all the reasons are there to make North declarer on this hand, but it just did not work here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that west should bid 1@D rather than pass--playing a system where 1@C can be short alolows you to respond on garbage when you have short clubs  |pg||

nt|justin c: did N think dec had another trump there?|pg||
nt|justin c: lets move on|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a routine 3NT making lots |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Dan Neill|pg||
nt|garnetts: The last hand dec had no choice but to get the spade right because he could count North's points--the ace of spades he would open |pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|justin c: hi Dan|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hello Dan |pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north was marked with KQJ of spades - the QJ of diamonds so could not have king of clubs. |pg||
nt|garnetts: true but then South could not have been suitably manipulated as he was |pg||
nt|odysseus69: wise not to double!!|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@H for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@S is cheap here |pg||
mb|1D|nt|justin c: agreed he should get the @S right|pg||
nt|rmb1: More on a non-spade lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: but very hard to find unless West bids |pg||
nt|justin c: @S lead stopping 6@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sheila a: This is the slight downside to the Multi, in that it's easier for E to come in over 2@d than 2@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|greerm: 3NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: but the chances of doing so were dramatically improved by N endplaying S|pg||
nt|rmb1: Now it will be difficult to stop East|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|garnetts: this theme came up in the first set--do you guys think 1@S is best or 2@C?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Canape opening |pg||
nt|garnetts: interesting |pg||
nt|garnetts: Now no one will know who the hand belongs to --if North pre-empts |pg||
mb|4H|nt|diana1: very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: likely to finish in a partcsore --1NT or 2@S |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@C for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: not the greatest dummy but has chances|pg||
nt|greerm: in theory 4@C 2@S 2@D and 1@H |pg||
nt|greerm: can the defence chalenge that?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT should end it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3NT or 4@S here i think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@S is possible|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit I would have bid 4@S over 3@D --I think it is right to pressurise here |pg||
nt|garnetts: EW really missed a chnace in my view |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  i don't think they can, but a few concerns for declarer|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  the upside is that West may not have a cue bid available|pg||
nt|garnetts: Norman did well to avoid 2@C |pg||
pc|d6|nt|greerm: he that hesitates is lost ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: strange auction on Board three in the OR  and they failed to double the final contract and still gained 5 imps |pg||
nt|odysseus69: The Irish South must have heard your tip David - he opened 3D with 6-4 on board 2 and picked up 5 imps|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bt: we had an undo. makes more sense now. maybe there should be a bid for the west hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like 2@c as well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: well I agree I much prefer 2@C |pg||
pc|d4|nt|justin c: for one thing, 2@C to be followed with 2@S is more economical than 1@S then 3@C, as here|pg||
nt|garnetts: he did--but I wouldn't bid it with a side major unless partner had passed laready |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|justin c: intra the @S suit :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes I forgot we all overbid here nbecause we are such great card players these days |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will not be easy - at the very least needs an intra finesse in spades  |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sheila a: I think if partner bids one major have to use the other as a cue|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Always easy to overbid from the commentators seat|pg||
nt|garnetts: If plays the intra he likely looked --he will surely try and ruff a club and try ace and another spade|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I suspect he will struggle whatever he does|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|garnetts: He surely did not play the Q@H  |pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: yes :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A cunning fasle card Mr B. |pg||
nt|justin c: helping declarer to finesse the @H10 later|pg||
nt|garnetts: it was a bit windy not to double 4@C |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|nt|garnetts: maybe that is a better idea than helping partner--|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: 2@C by W would have been the winner, but perhaps that is not allowed by their system|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: He must be so glad he played that Q@H now |pg||
pc|d5|nt|bt: people usually dont work much on 1X-(1N)-?? in their system, pretty common auction|pg||
pc|s4|nt|greerm: looks like defence can make it difficult but not quite difficult enough|pg||
nt|greerm: @C now only postpones it|pg||
nt|paulg:  a club now would force declarer to guess the layout|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: N/S have @D, greter that @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: and does show the five four shape you actually have--C plus S  not the other way round |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rmb1: OK 12 tricks on a non-spade lead was a bit double-dummy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|odysseus69: veer windy- partner opened 3D vulnerable in 2nd seat and it looked like 4 tricks in his own hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: he has to play a club --no option |pg||
nt|chessmaste: No reason to play the king here - unless you are on declarer's side|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: not tooo regular, bad suit, bad hand, first seat vul|pg||

nt|garnetts: I quite like the 2@C bid--good psyche|pg||

nt|rmb1: 2@C may be systemic: clubs or GF balanced, as some play; but its not on their card|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|justin c: 5 imps to England for playing 3@D instead of 3NT brd 2|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|garnetts:  I think 3NT after 3@D likely shows 4-4 majors and that leaves 3@H as a relay|pg||

nt|djneill:  South was listening clearly|pg||

mb|2S|nt|xenya: chance for Bjorken now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it seems that 2@c should be a strong 1-suited hand|pg||
nt|justin c: NS could get into trouble here|pg||
nt|garnetts: you should work out why a @D back is best--North clearly must have two or three clubs only so play partner for the right @D holding |pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: Lindsay will want to do something more|pg||
nt|paulg:  double is most flexible|pg||
nt|paulg:  at least you are on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: Lindsay interrogating Outred...|pg||
nt|diana1: it says on their convention card that 2@c over a strong 1@c opening is natural|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think 3@C is what this rebid is worth |pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT looks on too |pg||
nt|garnetts: Q@H has its attractions |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes - 4@H too much :)|pg||

nt|chick: safe now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bridge_one: sry, 4@H too much (my yes was for pass at 3@S)|pg||

nt|diana1: yes sorry Paul you are right (I forgot about their notes)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 2@H-sufficient to make a try|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: anyone think North might double 3@D?  After all it must be optional |pg||
nt|justin c: not so sure about 2@H myself|pg||
nt|rmb1:  3 flat in 4H=.  At least crouch opened 4@D as South :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sheila a: this might be a let-off for NS|pg||

pc|d7|pc|h2|nt|justin c: 3NT is lucky rather than good|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Yes, 2@C looks like an underbid - still only a non vulnerable game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: either red suit for 9 tricks -club for 10|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@D distinctly unswashbuckling|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk3: 2@C a game-forcing relay|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  how it's not clear that you can make 4@s anyhow|pg||

nt|garnetts: why the second double--3@C better isn't it?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: double looks a bad idea - why not 3C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|greerm: spec tells me 1NT was 15-17|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like to get in and out quickly with this hand type--3@C makes them find fit at that level 21D might let them in more easily |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@c was 5-card stayman|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with Mark 3NT looks like a good shot now |pg||
nt|justin c: needs a @S lead i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: six solid and a rag outside |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will westr lead a spade now?|pg||
nt|justin c: could even ruff out the @SA, but the entry position awkward for that|pg||
mb|6N|nt|toobad: stretcher please??|pg||
nt|justin c: making now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: The Outreds routinely open light so Vi has to invite with her 12 count|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All over for the defence now|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: it looks as if McGann has overbid his cards and Hanlon may raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: playing 3Nt instead 4Nt is a advantage|pg||
nt|greerm: out alive :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice auction from West ... this must show some slam interest with no diamond control|pg||
nt|justin c: grab this, pitch a @S on the @CA, and pull trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he knows his partner|pg||
nt|garnetts: To me this looks like a very strong sequence by East--the second double and then 4@C  |pg||
nt|garnetts: I am wondering why anyone would rebid 1NT--when you have a perfactly good rebid in hearts available|pg||
pc|d2|nt|justin c: this looks difficult|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  4, East opened 3@C not 1@C and the 4441 20HCP South hand could not go plus.  4@D-1.  5IMP to WBU|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bt: can discard a sapde and a club, what next|pg||
nt|diana1: they are obviously playing transfer responses to 1@c here and the 1@s bid denies 3@hs |pg||
nt|paulg:  not so obvious I'm afraid|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@ss rather|pg||
nt|justin c: there are preemptive raises, and preemptive raises|pg||
nt|justin c: not a bad idea to give p a clue what is happening|pg||
nt|justin c: for instance, he has 18-19 bal, and needs to know whether to bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs asking - 1@C showed 3+ @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: true--if he has then bid it in my view--having all this extra system burdens the mind for the play and serves leiitel useful purpose |pg||
nt|garnetts: little |pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: toilet break|pg||
nt|djneill:  West can put East with the @dA and a @h honor, but that's it|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe @sJ or @cQ if lucky|pg||
nt|justin c: @H10 i think|pg||
nt|justin c: planning on forcing the S hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  @h would kill a red squeeze against East in some situations (@hA is communication)|pg||
nt|justin c: playing in @H, can isolate the @S threat, but not here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  1@h shows any 12+ and 1@s shows 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|diana1: I know that David and Rex in the other room do |pg||
nt|paulg:  then 2@h is a transfer to spades followed by invitational 2NT|pg||
nt|diana1: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: some work needed here|pg||
nt|paulg:  this would not be a good hand for lead of 10 showing 0 or 2 higher honours|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bt: spade|pg||
nt|garnetts: here endeth the squeeze |pg||
nt|rmb1: If South played @D7 would East find the 8?|pg||
nt|garnetts: west can now take care of the diamonds --the J@D was a little naive as no one would really lead from a Q against 6NT |pg||
nt|rmb1: ... and declarer could always postpone @D finesse|pg||
nt|justin c: needed to win @DK keeping @DJ in dummy, then cross in @C and play @S off|pg||
nt|justin c: W must duck it|pg||
nt|rmb1: I hate to say this (again) but isn't declare thinking a trick too late|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|toobad: 3h denies a d control|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|rmb1: tempting to duck to not rectify the count|pg||
nt|justin c: then cash many winners, and endplay West or drop the @DQ, depending on his choice of discard|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|paulg:  okay, even better|pg||
nt|justin c: this needs him to read the position in the ending, but if the @D2 was 4th highest, should get it right|pg||

pc|c9|nt|bridge_one: now 4 @D are good for N/S|pg||

nt|garnetts: 3NT again|pg||
nt|justin c: how will this one go on a @S lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: who can resist overcalling against a strong club?  |pg||
nt|chick: Makes partner think you have a loser there|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: needs care on a spade lead |pg||
nt|justin c: 3 rounds of @D beats 4@S by S i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  3@c is 9-12 HCP with 3 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1C is Polish - either weak balanced or strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I know--but it would have been a good time to try 1@H wouldn't it?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose that East was limited on last since he didnt open 1 club|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats true but it wasn't our system |pg||
nt|peachy: 11.5-14 NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: It did not occur to me that North might double |pg||
nt|justin c: sorry not sure im right about that|pg||
nt|justin c: would have two pitches on @D |pg||
nt|rmb1: After @DQA, South discards a club on third diamond, and a club on @DK, and finesses for no club losers.  may not have the entries|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a: E must have known he was giving up the chance of ever getting his A@h so he was relying on partner to have a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: needs to duck a @D to west |pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant -- cash two high spades first|pg||
nt|justin c: hope he can see how to beat this, I sure cant|pg||
nt|garnetts: this looks cast iron |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|justin c: how does one do that?|pg||
nt|garnetts: my kind of play hand |pg||
nt|garnetts: good try by East--wrong K  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: been in worse slams|pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: exactly--was being ironic |pg||
nt|peachy: 3D alerted, apparently re-transfer|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose 2N shows @D shortness?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|justin c: :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|diana1: the play here shouldnt be too difficult although no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Kx looks like a dead holding --so why bother---West might have re booted this and then the double really costs |pg||
nt|justin c: very speculative double|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He is lucky his @D K is a trick - or is he? If East held the ace 6@D would be making.|pg||
nt|garnetts: you get away with this to an extent when the opps forget to use the blue card |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|greerm: Ian needs to play @H for 1 loser, with no clues?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|djneill:  South was hoping North could bid NT, maybe with Qxx, better sided|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|greerm: more natural to play first @H from the table which will mean 1 off|pg||
nt|paulg:  i can't see any|pg||
nt|peachy: their card does not go that far in continuations|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d3|nt|peachy: I would just assume 2NT was some sort of superaccept|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|diana1: so he can afford to throw a @s and a @h|pg||
nt|sheila a: Best defence is to cash A@s and then exit with a @c, but will S know that?|pg||
nt|justin c: will play @D from S twice, |pg||
pc|s7|pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|bt: meanwhile another board that does not matter, we should congratulate skara to an amazing performance!|pg||
nt|bt: and see what happens in champions leauge :-)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|justin c: hoping @DQ in W, so can duck|pg||
nt|peachy: not common to have a singleton in NT opening, also an assumption of mine|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  Matheson's redouble on board 22 has earned 13 imps for Scotland|pg||
pc|c5|nt|diablo666: Yep, big congrats! Well deserved! The year of Nobbe is here :) .|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: 12 tricks too |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|diana1: course 2 rounds of spades could give him a bit of trouble - or 1 even:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: careless again for 12th|pg||
nt|garnetts: well should have |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|greerm: he done it, vwd|pg||
nt|greerm: Ian MAtheson did well toduck, but declarer has started so I'll finsih :)|pg||
nt|greerm: started to play for this @H holding I mean|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'm told that Scotland will probably play this in 2@s, as they use 2@c for this type of raise|pg||
nt|paulg:  so Hamilton's play important and will win an imp rather than losing six imps|pg||
nt|rmb1: A good hand for an intermediate jump overcall (which NS play at this vulnerability)|pg||
mc|11|nt|chick: true, but a lot of people play variations on bidding small doubletons while accepting a transfer|pg||

nt|garnetts: brave bid--and got rewarded |pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S only here|pg||
nt|garnetts: THis type of hand could be dealt with by opening 2@C and rebidding 4@S maybe |pg||
nt|garnetts: nasty  hand for NS |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hi Roger - do u know where find the CC of players ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxd: N-S is playing 1@C 16+, 1@D natural, 5c M, 2@D multi, 2M = 10-13 6+|pg||
nt|greerm: 3NT by NS now|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Another easy game here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would be pretty annoyed giving away 150 for no reason |pg||
mb|1N|nt|diablo666: Nope, sry. Staffan will check it out...|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c shows diamonds, or a 5-card major with 4-card minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  they have been very solid since the accident on  22, probably give them confidence for the rest of the weekend|pg||
nt|chick: I'm not sure that S should have "super" accepted ... that @DK wasn't carrying it's weight and that left S with a measly 12|pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sheila a: not the world's best 4 card minor|pg||
nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  there could be blood if East doubles|pg||
nt|sheila a: Lindsay may be wondering if partner has @s|pg||
nt|garnetts: If I had been west it would have been 400 |pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont expect too much action by N/S|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will North bid?  They have been quite conservative.|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: or 4@H maybe|pg||
nt|garnetts: unless some oficious busybody tells me its not allowed these days |pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: ty staffan|pg||
nt|justin c: Erichsen agrees with you, anyway|pg||
nt|justin c: we will find out if Selway does presently|pg||
nt|garnetts: so it appears --I am humbled :)  |pg||
nt|djneill:  Selway related to Soloway?|pg||
nt|justin c: easy to reflect with that N hand that you have a trick or two for a partner who can make 4@S without your help|pg||
nt|chick: I count a lot of losers here|pg||
nt|peachy: this cant make|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  wow, that is a big pass by East|pg||
nt|sheila a: I guess most would play x as pass or correct by E in this situation?|pg||
nt|diana1: it really is - has to do something|pg||
nt|chick: 4 clubs, 2 hearts, maybe a diamond, and maybe a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Chris Dixon|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think double would be for takeout so Selway was stuck |pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Good morning all|pg||
nt|justin c: hi chris|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning Chris|pg||
nt|rmb1: Morning|pg||
pc|c9|nt|greerm: 2NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: takeout double here, will lead to 4@H by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: good barrage by NS |pg||
nt|garnetts: well does east absolutely promise four hearts?  I think not |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|djneill:  West is feeling not bad about setting chances, for a little bit|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|greerm: that might deny 2@H in which case N will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes in these auctions someone just has to bid notrump even with Jxx|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|odysseus69: looks like he needs hearts 2-2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: many pair use the open of 4@C, in first and second position, with long suit in ! closed and A or K out - here the advantage to play natural|pg||
pc|h5|nt|greerm: i meant bid 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: same hand a heart less and spade more--what would you do?  |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is unlikely to take long|pg||
nt|justin c: @h can still be right in 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good point - double cannot guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: with short @H hand taking the @S force|pg||
nt|justin c: agreed, X covers a lot of ground|pg||
nt|justin c: not a lot else East can do with quite a lot of hands here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: long suit in @H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|justin c: personally, I am not wild about opening 2@C on hands like this|pg||
nt|djneill:  and there it went|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|chick: he can set up some hearts, but meanwhile the spades are going to be established for the defense, too|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: note the force of intermediate cards in the trump suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|diana1: double is probably the best thing as he is happy enough if his partner passes or bids spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might not make either --needs accurate play |pg||
nt|justin c: both of Easts @H go no|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|justin c: i think you need defensive strength too|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  given the carnage that may ensue, this is probably the safest spot for EW|pg||
nt|garnetts: unlucky if you venture into the five level |pg||
pc|c5|nt|djneill:  best defense is a good offense, so South has a lot of defense|pg||
nt|rmb1: No double - no trouble - just dript off|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chessmaste: The 4-1 heart break is a blow for declarer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He must now change tack |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sheila a: maybe he was worried that he had insufficient defence if partner was quite weak??|pg||
nt|justin c: outvoted as usual :)|pg||
nt|justin c: problem one, north has no idea when he should bid on over 4@S here|pg||
nt|rmb1: - *drift* off|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: The late John Collins first used this idea--and i thought he was right when I first saw it and still do |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|garnetts: that will mean he gets the @D length right though--so a @D to the K --simply play the k@D first then lead towards  the ace |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg:  except opponents are already limited, so can easily be your hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is on track now|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|diablo666: West showing extra values with no short suit, a bid that shows a positive attitude towards life :) .|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only 1 key cards in East, perhaps better 4@S over 3@D (but i don't know what means 3@D, could be conventional bid)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I am not sure a simple 2@S is right on the East hand - maybe 3@S - unless they think that is weak|pg||

nt|justin c: question is whether this is 'strong'|pg||
nt|justin c: it is if your p promises to produce the @SK and an A|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The other question you need to ask is if I bid 2@S will partner pass on many hands where we have a play for game?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sheila a: would either of you be tempted to open 1@s?|pg||
nt|justin c: (available from all good bookshops :) )|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: South has a fine multi--North does not--an offensive weapon should not have two cast iron defensive tricks --and also the three cards in spades is an issue |pg||
nt|garnetts: swing to Wales here|pg||
nt|peachy: UNbalanced, sorry|pg||

mb|1N|nt|paulg:  against my religion to open 1@s|pg||

nt|sheila a: I see Scotland failed to make 4@s on board 8 so it's a gain to Northern Ireland|pg||
nt|diana1: so Board 8 where Charles went one off in 4@h their other pair went one off in 4@s|pg||
nt|greerm: yet another 2 suiter|pg||
nt|paulg:  3 of them!|pg||
nt|greerm: squared|pg||
nt|justin c: possible 3NT for EW, but not easy to get there|pg||

nt|djneill:  East 1@d?|pg||
nt|justin c: sick|pg||
nt|garnetts: it can be beaten on a spade lead or A@D and a switch |pg||
nt|garnetts: but like low @D and then nine tricks |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS can make 7@h but you do not wnat to be in it!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|diana1: so a small double swing|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play light initial actions but this too light for even them|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: who will get his spake in first?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|paulg:  smallest possible|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@H now, michaels or ghestem|pg||
nt|greerm: east doesn't mind with 5@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  michaels|pg||
nt|garnetts: too strong maybe |pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  everyone was sick they passed out|pg||
mb|2H|nt|justin c: oh dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|greerm: West is pretty powerful now|pg||
nt|greerm: needs little but needs exact cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless his partner has the @dA, would need to discard partner's hearts on his clubs|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2NT without a stopper is ambitious|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also agree with 2NT--even though it might well not work out well here|pg||
nt|justin c: hard to like double with the south cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: now Ian must guess that his void isn't working|pg||
nt|toobad: hard not to make a try|pg||
nt|justin c: @S ruff beats 4@H here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chrisdixon:  EW hands fit well here and it looks as if 10 tricks might be made - although a clubb lead and spade switch would defeat game|pg||
nt|justin c: but game not at all bad lookings at the EW cards alone|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: Many ways to raise hearts in this hand, I would have chosen a more descriptive one, either splinter or bid 1S to look for doublefit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: maybe 3@H says I do not have a real stop --they can then grope |pg||
nt|garnetts: I have played that myself |pg||
nt|justin c: even after an indecently thorough grope, nowhere to go|pg||
nt|garnetts: it does--but NS were wise to let this one go--a spade lead or switch is essential |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|paulg:  this looks very normal and the fortunate spade and club positions means that it will always make|pg||
nt|greerm: 5@C is 0/3 I presume|pg||
nt|garnetts: west might not lead a heart--but he shoudl because he has nothing else much |pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  and the fortunate diamond position|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  I am surprised that Mike Tedd remained silent throughout here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|diana1: so this lead lets him get rid of his @s loser|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I expect it will be flat across the event|pg||
nt|diana1: yes probably|pg||
nt|paulg:  the North hand has no entry to cash the spade|pg||
nt|toobad: yes|pg||
nt|greerm: key lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: not the best sequence of bids I have ever seen |pg||
pc|dA|nt|greerm: off now, i think ok on any other lead but suppose @HK natural|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|garnetts: but likely to make |pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  NS play 3@c as a mini splinter|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|justin c: suppose he might double 2@H on the way out|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes and I am also suprised that South did not try 3@C in the pass out seat |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|paulg:  considering that the hands are quite exciting and interesting, the imp score is very low|pg||
nt|garnetts: you might settle for 3@S --an intial double is not a panacea|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  He was not in the pass out seat|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|h8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|garnetts: a smooth duck was needed |pg||
nt|garnetts: thats why then :) |pg||
nt|garnetts: teach me to multi task |pg||
nt|rmb1: On  9 England avoided slam +11IMP|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|peachy: ok, they didn't have splinter available, as minisplinter less points, and 4C would have shown void|pg||
nt|peachy: is that correct Julian|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|greerm: Needs a revoke now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  @hK natural but diamond lead could have been the killer|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sheila a: I was just checking the play in 4@S on board 8. West had no entry so @s had to be played from the big hand|pg||

mb|d|nt|paulg:  2@s showing a 3-card limit raise is very popular with the 5-card majorites here|pg||
nt|garnetts: we do try to argue for leads we really would make and not just those that work when we can see all of the hands |pg||
nt|garnetts: should be totally flat in 4@S |pg||

pc|c9|nt|sheila a: the auction does kind of suggest @h are 4-4|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless 1@d was a transfer to hearts|pg||

nt|garnetts: hearts break spades on  side -not reall problems in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: 1@d is unbal with either minor, 1NT is a game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: West must be considering slam possibilities|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: D or S?|pg||
nt|greerm: no reason to think of a @D|pg||
nt|greerm: hard to see how this will make, but 8 tricks there so....|pg||
nt|toobad: needs help|pg||
nt|greerm: defence might let him set up a @H trick ?|pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|justin c: very fair, not set|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rmb1: NS play four card majors (not come up before in this set)|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like the slam hand has made the difference this set|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  the defence has to be quite careful to beat this I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normal lead normal contract J@H normal play @C to the Q--then we can all go back to sleep for a while |pg||
pc|d5|nt|greerm: North will have to find the @D suit soon|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|paulg:  needs to switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am truly amazed that West passed 4@S in the OR--must have failed to pay an entry fee |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|greerm: home now|pg||
nt|garnetts: the "@D bid did not have much appeal to be honest and anyway south has ignored it |pg||
nt|peachy: 1C was 11-13 balanced, or any 17+|pg||
nt|chick: looks like the same 11 tricks|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  He can take two @S finesses and end up with 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulg:  in some relay systems south would have shown nothing about her hand on this auction|pg||
nt|paulg:  and it would do her no good at all this time|pg||
nt|sheila a: Unless West is put off leading a @s and tries a @c ...|pg||
nt|chick: especially with that lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chessmaste: That was a good (inspired?) decision by North to pass 3@H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|justin c: this is the last board of this set|pg||
nt|justin c: many thanks all|pg||
nt|garnetts: lthanks all  |pg||
nt|justin c: and we restart at 15.10 (in theory)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sheila a: Scotland edge into the lead thanks to a tiny swing on the awkward board 11|pg||
pc|s9|nt|greerm: missed the "obvious " squeez that we can see|pg||
nt|garnetts: totally agree--North seems to be agressive mostly then suddenly makes a very conservative pass |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|garnetts: j@S is the right card |pg||
nt|garnetts: In case partner has AQ10x|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|toobad: Rex and David are bidding them up in the open room|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  10, South played 4@S got a diamond lead and the defence got their ruff but declarer disposed of his club losers as we thought might be possible|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rmb1: ... 4@S= only 1IMP to Wales|pg||
nt|justin c: low scoring set of boards|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s6|nt|justin c: if the slam hand went the other way, v big difference|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Still, South did not bid 2@S which would have shown a strong raise, so he knew the dummy would be modest|pg||
nt|garnetts: ttfn |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a: hard to see any more than 7 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|diana1: the EW played in 3@c-2|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@c-1|pg||
nt|sheila a: Sime judged to pass the W hand over 1NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: which made things simpler|pg||
nt|paulg:  if Vi takes theis and plays a spade, then West may feel it is necessary to cash @cA for down one|pg||
nt|paulg:  or even ducks|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|rmb1: Still four results from open room to come|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|chick: And a great job by our excellent operator, Hugh Gormally :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzers were quiet, don't be ahy, if you have a comment, just message one of us, we'd love to hear and share|pg||
