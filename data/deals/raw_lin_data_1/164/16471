nt|vugraphzyh: North could choose to bid 3@D (splinter) would be my choice but maybe he didnt like to do it with K stiff|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: probably needs a stronger hand for the splinter|pg||

nt|yuval10: now he can either ruff a @h or play @c to the 9|pg||
nt|yuval10: his only losing option is if he decide that W has TXX @c and will try to endplay him with Q@c and @c|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|april7: here EW might go go overboard but perhaps they will stay in a good 3NT contract|pg||
mb|2C|an|non-GF|mb|p|nt|april7: 6@C is a possible contrACT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|patricck: 6@C is a lucky contract, but not 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed think west should pass here|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't like the 3NT rebid tbh|pg||
nt|neobas: I usually play it as solid diamonds and a bit too much to open a Gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: no W is thinking about a 6 @C contract and will have the luck to make it if he decides to do it|pg||
nt|neobas: Anyone for 3@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@C may be ok provided they could stop in 4NT|pg||
mb|4C|nt|patricck: 3@D is the more normal rebid...  I don't think 3NT is such an ugly choice tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: AH AH|pg||
nt|neobas: "My @C are more solid than your @D"|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a major cue?|pg||
nt|neobas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: now 4 @D and then 6@C perhaps|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: now e/w should get to 6@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: must avoid 6NT|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C can be beaten on a @H lead as long as when the Q@S is run on the first round of the suit South ducks|pg||
nt|april7: W should ofcourse pull trumps before giving up a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be tough i think|pg||
nt|april7: 6NT possible except on @H lead,but S will lead @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry, stupid of me, diamonds don't need to be set up in clubs|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Is it worth it then|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 1@s by N|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think people could take the trouble to memorize the conventions they play and then Ghestem is FAR superior to MIchaels|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 3NT is the contract here for NS|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: why would they forget?|pg||
nt|hedyg: do they forget bergen? splinter?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They do, or some do rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The more you add, the more there is to remember .... and forget!|pg||
nt|othered1: do they play new suit forcing after overcall?  I play minor/major forcing 1 rd.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i will bite my tongue...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: 2@D explained as constructive nf|pg||
nt|davidb: they  are Young they remember!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: New minor is NF for me, new major F1|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like the leaders in the CR had some misunderstanding regarding it|pg||
mb|3C|an|forcing|mb|p|nt|vugraphzyh: Not sure Yuval|pg||
nt|yuval10: why would you pass 2@d with AKX and a singelton then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: But anyway they have a big lead they can afford some bad boards|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C looks aggressive to me, if they don't h ave a rather low limit on their overcalls.|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can at the very least bid 3@d|pg||
nt|davidb: N in CR  took a very pesinistic view |pg||
nt|davidb: m|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Alon can't bid 3NT with @HJ10, can he?|pg||
nt|othered1: And in the middle is a simple raise to 3@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C for a overbid - Pass just bad - 3@D would be my bid if 2@D NF|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Peter, now Birman can bid 3NT though|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably the only way to get there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only because he is stuck for a bid I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 3@H?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Thats a big bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no after 3@D from N easu for S to bid 3NT - 3@D = extra values when 2@D NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but on this auction, Peter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 3@c is extra extra values then?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|davidb: 5 D will go down|pg||
nt|pelu: what is 3@C - I know forcing - but could be nayural when 1@C = short @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: 3NT is obviously the best spot but its a bit unlucky that 5@D goes down, not the worst spot ever|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Right Peter, and I think 4@C might be based on 3@C being natural|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: look at S's bidding he exp 3@C to be natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: K lead for count|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: no, he alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: He tought north showed a strong hand with @D support and had a slam in mind|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont EW play better minor?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Personally, I"d charge the cue-bid for missing he better 3N.  But 5@D will be tough to beat|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|davidb: 3cl -I have a big hand .  lets play game . Alon thougt  he has 4 cards in D-he should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Specs tell me that 5@D is makeable. I can only see 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Even if he runs the spade to the Q East will have to guess what to return|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, they can "just play @D to beat it" but it's nontrivial, I think, and indeed, they haven't found it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did I miscount?|pg||
nt|pelu: S need to ruffs with @d7 5 - a @h-ruff and a@S-ruff then 11 tricks on cross-ruff - but opp just need to play @d once|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: East might think his partner has 4@H's and stiff @S for this play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it takes a defensive error to let it make|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Roland, you didnt|pg||
nt|davidb: 9D  is the key !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As Peter said, one round of trump is enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lazar makes his 9@d on an overrruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Alon probably thinks to himself "why on earth do I have to play 5@D with 9 easy tricks in 3NT"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer has 3 losing clubs, how is he going to get rid of all of them without conceding a trump trick?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: East has one heart too many now, that's the problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he had been out of hearts declarer can't make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why the spade pitch was fatal|pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: Right roland, was not easy for him to see when he made that pitch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Look at this ending with one spade more with East and no heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then no way to make it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: well an "easy" slam?|pg||
nt|april7: 2aces with W are enough for E, ace of @H better then ace of @C ofcourse!!|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|patricck: 6NT by West gets all the marks in Bidding Challenge, but any resonable slam will do here|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|neobas: E not thrilled by the 3@D response|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S IS DANGEROUS|pg||
nt|neobas: I play 4@S here as a Namyats, I think the hand is worth more than that|pg||
nt|april7: if 3@D is positive, why not 4NT by E!!!???|pg||
nt|neobas: All depends on methods|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed |pg||
nt|roswolf: west should blackwood hinself i think|pg||
nt|april7: it only depends on aces and ofcourse sometimes which|pg||
nt|april7: 4NT by W doesn't serve much|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry that adds a different dimension|pg||
nt|neobas: 4@S looks to show 9 tricks with @S as trumps|pg||
nt|april7: interchange ace of @H with ace of @C and down you go|pg||
nt|april7: not really, @C would be 3-3 for discard!!|pg||
nt|patricck: well, that would still be a slam that I would want to be in|pg||
nt|roswolf: silver lining|pg||
nt|april7: ofcourse, we all went already down in certain slams:):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west must bid on 2 aces are golddust on this bidding|pg||
nt|patricck: with A@C the 3-3 break unnecessary except on a diamond lead|pg||

nt|patricck: If North's 2@S said he didn't like spades much then South bought a very lucky hand|pg||
