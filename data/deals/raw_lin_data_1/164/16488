mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|fluffy: NS land on a very good contract playing old style non forcing 1NT, note that forcing 1NT this time would work poorly ending up in a not so good 2@c|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|sT|nt|fluffy: on this hand the best defence after winning 3 spades is to switch to a heart!|pg||

nt|fluffy: and its over, I have no clue how the other table did|pg||
nt|fluffy: but given the 6@h -1, the 4@sX and another score I think MArimon and Viola probably won this match|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: Bochi starts surprisingly with 2@c, most of us would had bid 1@h|pg||
nt|fluffy: this match features Norberto Bocchi & Xavi Massana against Francisco Marimon and Carmen Viola|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 2@d is french style game forcing hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|fluffy: now Masana intends 2@s as the convention known as 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@h is a negative bid showing 0-7 HCP aprox|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|fluffy: the 2@s bid is new to me, so can't tell you much more|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: Bochi has decided to avoid missunderstandings settling for the practical 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|mc|11|nt|fluffy: he doesn't like his diamond shotness|pg||
pg||

nt|fluffy: one of my favourite self quotes: "Never ask when you can show instead"|pg||
nt|fluffy: normally you would want to play in the suit of the weak hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: to have more comunication with it|pg||
nt|fluffy: but not this time because it forces you to rugg with honnors|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|fluffy: Bochi opts for an agressive 1@s, if he is getting into the auction he might also have tried 2@d showing both majors, wich is more preemptive|pg||
nt|fluffy: looks like we are again catching up with connection problems, the play goes ultra fast because all of this has already been played|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fluffy: but it also gives the opponents too much info, note that he is almost certain that they will end up playing the board|pg||
nt|fluffy: and operator is entering the bidding from the past manually|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: Masana should bid 3@s now|pg||
nt|fluffy: ok seems we catched up with real time|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fluffy: Bocchi decided to open 1@d in third position to create some problems|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|fluffy: when you don't know if you should bid one more into the 3 level or not|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably because he is angry about the previous hand|pg||
nt|babota: 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: this would be a trivial hand if he passed, Viola would open 2NT then|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fluffy: the key feature is always having 9 trumps|pg||
mb|d|nt|fluffy: if you have a 9th trump you can't do it very bad to go to the 3 level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|fluffy: 3@d again violates my useful rule: "Never ask when you can show", 3NT would show 20 balanced, and that is the right bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fluffy: Xavi Masana doubles wich is completelly normal given that partner opened the biding|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fluffy: it is often wrong to bid at the 3 level playing IMPs when you only hold 8 trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|fluffy: specially if the opponents are already at the 3 level, because you are so likelly to put them down and go yourself down instead|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|fluffy: unaware that he opponed with a subminimum hand|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|fluffy: Viola just had to play 2 times spades from her hand up to QJxxx to make 10 tricks|pg||
mc|10|pg||

mb|p|nt|fluffy: hemissguessed the club layout but he had already assured 1 down, and non vulnerable downs are worth little IMPs|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: MArimon quite conservative again, most players being a passed hand would bid 2@c or double (both minors) now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fluffy: 1@c opening gets me puzzled really, I though NS were playing standard methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: Masana was about to blast 4@s, but 2@h is the worst rebid he might hear, so maybe 3@s only is an option|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|fluffy: it would be very surprising to know that they play different methods in 4th position|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|babota: Maybe a mistake without undo :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: eyah maybe Xavi thinks @s3 is @c3|pg||
nt|babota: lol|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: claim just -  600 mp|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@h is the worst possible hearing bid for 2 reasons: it means partner has a lot of hearts, and it also means that he might have stretched to open with as little as 10/11 points|pg||
nt|fluffy: when you hold a 6 card major you might open with less than when you open with a 5431|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|fluffy: Bocchi needs a miracle to run this home, he is sure to lose 2@h, 1@d, 1@c and a club ruff|pg||
nt|fluffy: the key will be to mix it so that the club ruff is with a heart trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|fluffy: he needs some lucky lay ou tin hearts, and the current one is one of them|pg||
nt|fluffy: he might play now a diamond to cut opponents comunications|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is the key play if Viola has something like @hA10x|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|fluffy: Viola was right to switch to trumps to avoid diamond ruffs, but it is not enough|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|fluffy: Viola could introduce both suits with 2@h, but given that @s is the boss suit and he has more and better, she will just forget about clubs probably|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: viola didn't like the 2@c bid at all, and does very well to just stay silent|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: The normal action is to pass 1@s with Marimon cards, holding a doubleton club you don't like to double and see your partner bidding them|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|fluffy: Masana has a good hand but since opponents didn't raise spades he thinks its likelly to lose 2@s tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fluffy: 2@d is surprising bid unless as Nuno fereira points out they are playing "Gazilli" convention|pg||
nt|fluffy: when toyu play "Gazzilli" 2@c shows 1 of many 16+ HCP hands|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is a GF relay (showing 8+ HCP)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|fluffy: now massana jsut shows 5@s 4+@c|pg||
mc|11|nt|fluffy: and anyway 4@h is NOT encouraging towards slam, 2@c already showed some values, and jumping to game is a weak bid, following the fast arrival concept|pg||
pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4SQ8752HQ65D95CA65,ST963HA7DK642CT93,SKJHK43DA87CKQJ42,SA4HJT982DQJT3C87|sv|n|mb|p|nt|fluffy: really no contract was bound to make, but 4@s and 5@d had better chances|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fluffy: yet another hand where Carmen Viola (Cuca Viola for most bridge players) has a weak hand :), seems NS are getting all the honnors|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: here we got an auction my aunt& grandma would reproduce most likelly|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: Xavi was agressive earlier, will he try 2NT with this scattered 8 points?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fluffy: not sure what Xavi massana was thinking about, maybe 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: yeah he is vul at IMPs and goies for it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fluffy: Bocchi has an obvious 3NT over the game try|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fluffy: diamond lead clears the suit and now Xavi Massana has to decide the safest way to pull trumps|pg||
nt|fluffy: from the @d6 lead since opps lead 3rd and 5th, his only worry should be that Marimon has doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|fluffy: then he will always make by rejecting @s finese|pg||
nt|fluffy: in EW leading I think @h10 is consistent with both @hA109xx and @hJ109xx|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|fluffy: wow that is a heavy 2@s!|pg||
mb|d|nt|fluffy: heya|pg||
nt|fluffy: Masana has a very high ODR hand now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fluffy: Massana has minimum values but singleton spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: the normal bid with singleton spade is to double, to protect partner|pg||
nt|fluffy: he wants to declare this hand for sure|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h shuts Marimons likelly 3@d bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fluffy: because partner might have a very huge hand with many spades, awaiting your double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: I think most pairs play 2NT as some sort of conventional bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2NT has 3 meanings on most circles|pg||
nt|fluffy: natural|pg||
nt|fluffy: lebenshol (weak)|pg||
nt|fluffy: or scrambling (2 places to play)|pg||
nt|fluffy: Masana took 2Nt fr the third one|pg||
nt|fluffy: too bad Bochi had the other 2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|fluffy: problems like this are normal to arise on non usual partnerships|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fluffy: This match features Francisco Marimon and Carmen Viola, against Norberto Bocchi and Xavi Massana|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|fluffy: EW need to find @s switch or else spades will be dispatched on clubs|pg||
nt|fluffy: Marimon knows that spades is the right switch and that's why he tires to remain on lead|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|fluffy: Marimon goes to safety mode, avoiding disasters|pg||
nt|fluffy: the @s7 wasn't a clear enough signal, and he only needs 1 more trick to beat the contract|pg||
mc|9|nt|fluffy: so if tdeclarer had @sJxx @cAKxx for example playing a second spade would be fatal|pg||
pg||

mb|1N|nt|fluffy: finally Carmen Viola got a hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fluffy: the second spade only works for second undertrick wich is not very important playing IMPs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: sorry all BBO had some technical difficulties|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: seems we are back|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|fluffy: here we have a good suit example|pg||
nt|fluffy: how to play spades?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|fluffy: if you had entries to both hands it seems like you ahve to guess wich hand has @sQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: but that is not totally real|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: if you cash @sK first and then try the finese to south, you would lose to south´s @sQxxx|pg||
nt|fluffy: if you instead try running @s10 you might lose to stiff @sQ in north|pg||
nt|fluffy: so with a 5-3 fit missing only the queen, the best way to play is to finese though the 5 card suit|pg||
nt|fluffy: wich catters to a full 4-1 lie out, instead of just a partial one|pg||
nt|fluffy: well back to this hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: in this hand there are entry issues|pg||
nt|fluffy: first East doesn't have all the entries he want|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|fluffy: defence could have succed here just by playing diamonds, because declarer only had 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
mc|9|nt|fluffy: also could succed if south played @cJ at trick 2 instead of a low one, then bocchi could switch ot a heart, and still only 8 tricks for declarer (althou he might now succed ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: guessing clubs or endplaying north)|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 2@h bid is a reverse for most players, when the second bid of the opener is above his suit rebid (now it would be 2@d) it shows extra values (unless it is a raise)|pg||
nt|fluffy: this 3@c bid looks like a typo from the operator|pg||

nt|fluffy: my NS system's expert tells me that 2@h is a conventional bid to show a balanced or 1444 hand, 2@s is a relay and 3@c is exactly 4441|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|fluffy: why did she bid it with 10 HCP then? well, because his hand is lousy on a slam context, she is not worried at all abou missing slam|pg||
nt|fluffy: when it comes to slam her hand is worht about 8 HCP at most, more or less what 4@h shows anyway|pg||

nt|fluffy: that line only lsoes to east having @dK10xx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: but anyway, doubleton jacks are often worthless on all contexts :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: MAsana has 2 bids now, 2@d and double, 2@d focuses on his main suit, while double gets hearts into the picture|pg||
nt|fluffy: playing Match points it would be important to introduce hearts fro those little extra points, but playing IMPs given the likellyhood that opponents will be on 4@s soon, it is ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: better to just go for the diamonds|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 5@d will normally be a better contract than 5@h, even when partner is 4-2 in the reds, because our hearts are lousy, and we might be in heavy trouble when @h split 4-1|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 2@h looks like a conventional bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: bocchi stretches to bid 2@h, some people would just pass, but on modern bridge I think most people will bid 2@h or forcing 1NT|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|fluffy: Italians play transfer in the sequence 1@c-(1@s) I think, but as far as I know 2@h would show clubs, not diamonds|pg||
nt|fluffy: now Xavi Massana has IMO a clear 4@h bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fluffy: and anyway if 2@h shows diamonds what is 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: this 3NT requires Norberto Bocchi to guess the diamond layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 2NT is some sort of inquiry, and bocchi obviously rejects|pg||

nt|fluffy: he will surely lead @dJ first overtaking with the ace|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fluffy: but after that he has to guess if diamodns are 2-2 or 1-3|pg||

pc|c8|nt|fluffy: not a big deal for him, suspecting spades are 6-4 ir 7-3 it would be very hard for diamonds to be also longer in Viola's hands|pg||
