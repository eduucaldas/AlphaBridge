nt|toobad: 3nt by E/W here|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeirl: Hi Jystin|pg||
nt|toobad: flat game in any event|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2N!|nt|milton_se: fit jump, it seems|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|justin c: 4@h is where you want to be|pg||
nt|justin c: but not so easy to figure that out|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C = 11+ nat|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Just caught up. will enter final result:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Geoff |pg||
nt|toobad: afternoon Geoff|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: definitely the hot seat........like a sauna in here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Burns asking questions of 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: err  is that right?|pg||
nt|sybarra: in Philly,  I was in the "freezer room"   ....players arrived with coats on,  enjoy the heat |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|milton_se: trumps 3-2, no drama|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 5@C cheaper than 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not if NS can find their @s ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: but this can go down|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: Northern Ireland needs more "swingy" bds |pg||
pc|cK|nt|pfbr: swingy in their direction :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes indeed|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi John|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rmb1: Sorry 2@C = clubs INV+ or other GF, 2@D relay|pg||
nt|justin c: i should have more faith|pg||
nt|mikeirl: S attack best|pg||
nt|justin c: imagined that N would try harder to play in @C|pg||
nt|toobad: this should be off a trick in each suit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|justin c: knows he is being forced if @H trumps, but the short hand taking the tap in @C|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Seems as a flatty. 120 tr|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10 tr|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the necessity of making one more trick for game may have influenced his thinking|pg||
nt|rmb1: Trumps 3-3 makes this easy in practice but not before some agonising|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Jones asking system|pg||
nt|toobad: Hi Robin|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i guess it's quick run through|pg||
nt|mikeirl: assume there was more to the bidding than recorded :)|pg||
nt|steveray: saves time opening with the best contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: both pairs play strong NT and 5 card majors|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thats one way of retaining trump control :)|pg||
nt|justin c: temporarily, anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least your fingers move|pg||
nt|toobad: 6c here, but hard to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: NS may not bid on first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: S for a opening? Y|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rmb1: Have to avoid losing two spades in 4@H but defence may establish @CQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry just catching up|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ok|pg||
nt|steveray: hard to see this making|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  3NT is harder|pg||
nt|sybarra: S may enter the bidding this round|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|rodal f: Feel NS are in trouble|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes. D lead shoul beat |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the end of 3NT then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would like the see the bidding, i cant understand why they arent in 4@H|pg||
nt|steveray: assuming East opened 1@C South should not take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c "natural", ostensibly 5+ clubs and a major or 6+ clubs with enough to open the bidding|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh boy ...................|pg||
nt|toobad: a bit frisky by S at the vulnerability..|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: 2nt now??|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: y :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dburn: but being in third position at favourable is enough to open the bidding nowadays|pg||
nt|mrt2000: trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@C = nat, limited (6+ or 5C+4M)|pg||
nt|sybarra: havent gotten to card yet, is is some form of flannery?  (I may get killed for mentioning that word) |pg||
nt|toobad: a @H lead ducked by S woud have been really unpleasant for declarer|pg||
nt|toobad: short and sweet|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a discussion every partnership needs to have,  is 2 @D forcing by passed hand?  (I think not,  cue bid only force) |pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: won't be happy |pg||
nt|pfbr: :(|pg||
nt|mrt2000: happier than if doubled!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: N must have seen his partner's overcalls before|pg||
nt|toobad: 3c from Ian is v tame|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: E? Who have the rest of the pints?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Could have been a interestin 6@D if opp was 1-3 at @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for North to act with all but one of his points in opponents suits|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for South - best is probably not to shift to spades, but it looks an obvious defence to follow|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Second best|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzxa: N thinking...|pg||

pc|d5|nt|dburn: well, he followed it - but declarer didn't have any diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: and this has helped him keep control of the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: to the extent that if he can guess hearts, he will actually make|pg||
nt|rmb1: or discard a heart and ensure -1|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: he might - the cards are fairly well disposed|pg||
nt|toobad: started with 12 finished with 10|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rodal f: 2@S=force|pg||
nt|insia1: will they go to slam ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C allowing partner to judge what to do over 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hJ on side  in 6@c|pg||
nt|milton_se: there|pg||
nt|sybarra: anderson showing good judgement, as much as he would like to be in red game|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: can subsequently promote @S10|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3@D showed a @H suit here|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT = 16+ BAL|pg||
mb|3N|nt|steveray: but 5@H is cold on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rmb1: And NS judged to give up quietly ?|pg||
nt|justin c: if dec ducks trick 1, needs @h underlead later|pg||
nt|justin c: bit easier from where we are sitting|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 6@C to come|pg||
nt|toobad: 6c is a great contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: And the @C blowed away after the invit 3@D|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 10 or 11 tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Meddy:)|pg||
nt|steveray: North needs partner to play a club before the D@s are set up|pg||
nt|steveray: Diamonds that is|pg||
nt|dburn: one of these days, the English will lead trumps when declarer actually has some diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no great matter against a part score|pg||
nt|rmb1: Less good opposite 3442|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: well done erichsen|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but will south lead @C?|pg||
nt|steveray: might the @D be a singleton?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: odds on to|pg||
nt|rmb1: North can afford to be passive, but this is the most direct approach.  Hopefully 4@C bid will reap its rewards now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might take his partner for a singleton @D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer would not allow @DK to win if he had the ace|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hopefully selway will work that out|pg||
nt|justin c: is the West hand not worth a strong @C opening?|pg||
nt|justin c: seen worse|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe they dont get to game even then|pg||
pc|c8|nt|insia1: good bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make S hand as main and nwxt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe|pg||
nt|steveray: might expect the finesse to win|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he did |pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: click on the partnership, to see the convention card|pg||
nt|egezzer: West is John Greenwood,Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe club lead ...after alert, which may have been "could be 2" |pg||
pc|c3|nt|pfbr: david greenwood|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: the strong variety of 1@c has a higher lower bound for Carrot players than for Precision players|pg||
pc|c9|nt|insia1: I think he will drop @C, after finess @D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pfbr: (JTR) on bbo|pg||
nt|rmb1: Like scores at http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|rmb1: Temptation with 2-suiters is to open 1suit nat if possible to get your suits over quickly|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|steveray: well done|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: and experience suggests that, especially when at unfavourable vulnerability, two-suiters should try to bid naturally rather than open a strong club|pg||

nt|rmb1: open room started at board 15, so we will see comparisons when they complete board 1, etc.|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite sure why he made only three|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps to reassure his partner that they had not missed a game|pg||

nt|dburn: ah - the support double!|pg||

nt|rodal f: First swing to come it seems. Belive 3NT will come at OR|pg||
nt|mrt2000: as predicted|pg||
nt|toobad: after the opening bid, that hand played itself|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||

nt|toobad: 3nt + seems par|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|rodal f: Aiun't the hard boarsds so fare. New partscore|pg||

nt|steveray: easy 4@H|pg||
nt|toobad: 3nt here for ns|pg||
mb|d|nt|insia1: NS or EW will become a decl ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@D is a weak multi 0-7 (2M is 8-11)|pg||

nt|rmb1: 3NT now?|pg||
nt|dburn: more or less forced|pg||
nt|dburn: would like to double for penalty, of course, but...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  18 in open, South could open 3@C = both minors, weak|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: a reason the Hogg does not bid 1 sp?|pg||
nt|toobad: not the sort of board NI require when searching for imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|rmb1: "South could" in the sense that South was able to open|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rmb1: +1|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that rather woeful defence to two spades on board 18 appears not to have mattered very much|pg||
nt|justin c: yikes|pg||
nt|dburn: since North-South at the other table attempted Stayman redoubled|pg||
nt|milton_se: good nrakes|pg||

nt|sybarra: or 6 clubs|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|mikeirl: unusual lead of Q@H - wud normally be asking to unblock the J|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think they stop in game |pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" zoomed passed that|pg||
nt|toobad: NI have bid the club slam on board 19|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: East asking questions|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: not that unusual - plenty of pairs play that the king asks for count or unblock, the queen or ace for attitude|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pfbr: yes|pg||

mb|1H|nt|justin c: 6@S off on @H lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: On  8 (Ghestem) England bid to 4@S= so 4@Hx-2 was a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|toobad: qnother slam NS|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|milton_se: prev board may be costly: 3NT making and at least 500 in 2HX|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C splinter|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@S may be more descriptive from South but might deny a @D control|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Can't fight 2NT= It's the max EW and a normal contract|pg||
nt|toobad: S all controls so should get there|pg||
nt|rmb1: I think South was worth one try|pg||
nt|toobad: 4d couldnt hurt|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: stuck again:(|pg||
nt|toobad: no undo??|pg||
nt|rmb1: Obviously there are server problems folks.  Probably will not get comparisons from open room|pg||
nt|rmb1: May be lucky to get much more from this rooom :(|pg||
nt|toobad: this should have happened earlier when we were 70 down|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the open room, EW Hamilton and Hamilton are representing NI but one of them plays in Devon (near me) and part of their practice was a small one-day Swiss Pairs I ran in December ...|pg||
nt|rmb1: in Torquay|pg||
nt|rmb1: I am told "computers have frozen and we lost all scores so cant reconnect now"|pg||

nt|mrt2000: might be coming back here though|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: or then again...|pg||
nt|rmb1: wd|pg||
nt|dburn: Whittaker perhaps thought that Carroll was taking an advance save|pg||
nt|dburn: so his double was just penalty, not Lightner|pg||
nt|justin c: if one of East's @h were a @C would have 12 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: surely NOT 3@s|pg||
