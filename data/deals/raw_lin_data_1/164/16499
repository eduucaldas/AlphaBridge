mc|10|nt|minimeck: It is perhaps valid to say that the participants are bidding in a somewhat timid fashion with the spotlight of viewgraph, with that knowledge, very easy to become timid|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's worth more than 22 on the KnR I am sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me look|pg||
nt|tlc: now do these players use 4@D as a re xfr|pg||
nt|tlc: or as a Q...seems re-xfr more useful in general|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 23.2|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: as long as they both know what they do |pg||

nt|sybarra: hello Ed,  welcome back to Oz |pg||
nt|minimeck: 1@h opening :)?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, everybody|pg||
nt|tlc: certainly fits the Rule of 20, if you're an advocate of that (I am)|pg||
nt|tlc: hi ed..welcome|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: now to stay out of 6 |pg||
nt|minimeck: this may be somewhat difficult to diagnose|pg||
nt|tlc: anyone unfamiliar with this rule:  add the number of points to the total of your two longest suits, and if 20 or greater then open|pg||
nt|tlc: so 11 hcp + 11 (cards in your 2 suits) = 22..so u open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In traditional Jacoby 4@C shows 5-5 in H + C, but it also shows a *strong* side suit|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|minimeck: perhaps north should simply bid 4@h minimum with such a trashy hand despite shape?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This hand does not live up to that|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: N may be a bid nervous with the junk she holds|pg||
nt|tlc: the suit quality of the clubs isnt good enough for 4@C, but 6-5 still takes a lot of tricks with a big fit|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea, just seems like it's expressing those values twice, having allready opened the hand, anyway, Hui calls it a day missing one keycard to avert the mishap :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|othered1: Personally, my partnerships don't allow for bids that retract an earlier action (short of jumping to 6N, always NF)|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is 2 disappointed dummies in a row |pg||
nt|sybarra: *disappointing|pg||
nt|tlc: so we're a little too high again...the problem here is that north's double was a little light....|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|s7|pc|h6|pg||
