mb|1C|mb|p|nt|tomi2: its just ana agreement I have with some partners. with nat nonforcing I simply lead a club vs 1nt and with a good hand I double and lead a club|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|Gerben42: the other room made 3NT without @S stopper|pg||

nt|juror1: Buongiorno Giorgio|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello Slawek :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphp2: sorry for problems, Kalita played 7 of spade the result is -3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, lead a card and claim|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @SA was led which blocked the suit, small @S would be -1|pg||
nt|nagini: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|sfoxa:  danger!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, not, if 3nt was alerted|pg||
nt|tomi2: Tuszynski - Kowalski have been playing together for many years, I bet they know their follow-ups to multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree with pass by West - the DBL means only points, for sure not long @h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C would be forced|pg||
nt|nagini: he will manage:)|pg||
nt|vbman: so 1 nt is weak?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Nige Kearney|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nigel|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this contract is much safer|pg||
nt|vbman: or 15-17?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14 balanced hands are opened 1@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like this 3@S bid with this flat hand and a known 8 card fit only|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  N knows partner has maximum hand with @h|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2: west will need to decide what ace partner has|pg||
nt|vbman: and the rebid after 1 red suit is?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bridge_one: passed hoping in 2 @s tricks - difficult to think North void in @S !|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 12-14 they start a "rescue" sequence and try to find a ceah major fit before 1NT|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|nagini: only nuclear weapon against this transfers:)|pg||
nt|tez: hi Danny welcome:)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: But you bid a major over 1@D (0-7) if you have 12-14. Can be 3 cards|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|nagini: on this level they rarely bid without a reason|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is not natural. it may include "any 0-6 hand"|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sfoxa:  next time it does no harm, but now E has the lead as described in a bridge book|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vbman: oh so thats the famous polish club|pg||
pc|s9|nt|nagini: mostly playing against them askin for drink:)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|tomi2: neither 1@C nor 1@D must be alerted in poland|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like a strip hand...but since clubs behave, no problems whatsoever|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s was not enough|pg||
nt|3for3: if the jack didnt fall, declarer would be able to trump 4th club, and perhaps throw in the opponents|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with seven @C the pass at 3@H is dangerous - in this sequence 4@C can be a strong hand, but only long suit - and with K@S sgl can pass at 4@S ...|pg||

nt|tomi2: E/W are members of the Polish seniors team, having won lots of medals in the last years|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And N-S play for Lithuania|pg||
nt|tomi2: Lasocki used to be a top player in the 80's and 90's playing with Gawrys|pg||
nt|3for3: solid suits abound|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: at all level it is possible dont guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: ah yesss|pg||
nt|3for3: another 4@S EW|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tomi2: North is a sponsor from Lithuania who plays in Poland very often|pg||
nt|tez: i thk it will be end 4@s|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|tomi2: 3@D is probably invitational. North has support a single but minimum and no aces. this time 3@D is the best spot for them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably they use DBL for @h and 1@h for @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: so there is no mistake in saying that poland is one of the top nations of bridge|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nagini: happy Appy:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: All roads lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|3for3: a @D lead can cause problems for declarer...|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: South, I think, even lives in Germany right now, working as a Bridge teacher|pg||
nt|tomi2: E/W play transfers over their 1@C opener, even undoubled|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: well done finding the 5-3 fit in the 4th suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: here you see the reason why support doubles were invented originally. I read somewhere that Rodwell was also fan of bidding 3 card suits if there is no other good bid available and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: he did not like to play in 3-3 fits when partner raised him with 3 cards in competive situations|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt now may be|pg||
mb|p|nt|juror1: welcome Tezcan Sen of Turkey|pg||
nt|tez: he didnt.np|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nigel_k:  Opposite a weak NT game is unlikely and Qxx in opponents suit is bad|pg||
nt|vbman: can bridge teaching supply a living in europe?|pg||
nt|tomi2: remember, this is the Polish Premiere LEague, so it starts with a round robin event, but they will play KO matches afterwards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poland keep recruiting new players through hard work by a lot of people. The Polish junior players are extremely good, and they have lots of them|pg||
nt|3for3: diamond lead breaks the late entry to dummy.  declarer will fail..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: yes, especialy in Germany, we have lots of wealthy old people playing Bridge in their local clubs, who want to be better then their friends|pg||
nt|3for3: not too late to shift to the diamond, and give him a problem|pg||
nt|3for3: not obvious to lead into AKQJxx of a suit though|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 4@s to 3@d|pg||
nt|3for3: perhaps they play 3@S as forcing|pg||
nt|tez: ''2@d''|pg||
nt|3for3: north can infer diamonds are as you see them...partner might have led a stiff if he had one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42: friendly @c break sees this home|pg||
nt|othered1: with everything very friendly from this point, GIB (who peeks) would likely make an overtrick.  Here, though, declarer is looking for the safest line for 4. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now easy to make 10 tricks, because A in @C must be in West, so small @C from dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|vbman: any co?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|nigel_k:  At the other table South tried for game and 3@h failed by a trick|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As you can see declarer has no choice but to play for @sK onside|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but no communication to play this line having a loser in @d|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vbman: carry over?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|tomi2: the guys were always happy to play events in Turkey, like Istanbul 2004 or other open events!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|tomi2: there will be carry over but not significant, most important is, that the top 4 teams need to win 1 match only to get to semifinals|pg||
nt|tomi2: and if they lose they get a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|vbman: and u bet they do very well, burrying opponents|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5-8 teams first need to win among this group and then against one of the 1-4 losers|pg||
nt|vbman: seems fair enough|pg||
nt|tomi2: but any of the first 8 teams may become Polish champion while the teams ranked 9-16 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||

nt|vbman: he wont bid any less than 4h|pg||
nt|tomi2: but we won't see them live this weekend since the matches are played in 2 diffrent cities, and we have the North-East teams here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tomi2: teams from south and west, lke Wroclaw, play among themselfes in another city|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: winner are always winners|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|nagini: riski 3 cl|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but right time for it|pg||
nt|tomi2: what I find interesting is that both NS pairs, using the same methods, chose different bids on every of the first 4 hands|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 1 N tried to support partner with 3@S, in board 2 south started with a double and ot 1NT|pg||
nt|nagini: hard to stop before 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: most of the teams we see this weekend are from Warsaw|pg||
nt|vbman: so how long does it last and how many times is it held in a year?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tez: 5@c is not so bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: true Dany :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you start with 2 weekends rond robin, this is the 2nd one, and then several KO matches. The finals will be held in may|pg||
nt|vbman: no 3h will be the limit|pg||
nt|tomi2: the winner will represent Poland in the next European Champions Cup|pg||
nt|tez: flat 3NT|pg||
mb|3H|an| |mb|p|nt|tomi2: in 3 N went directly to the major game not trying for 3NT and in 2 they tried to invite balanced instead of going towards a @D contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|antoniz: odzywka praktyczna|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well bid|pg||
nt|tez: double dummy play..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for bridge players it is important to have good gadgets after 1ANY pass pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H after dbl 17+|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  3NT needs partner to have something in hearts, but making 11 tricks in diamonds needs a lot more|pg||
nt|nagini: want to play hearts? not a good idea:)|pg||
nt|vbman: oh my|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S by Vainikonis tends to promise 5 spades in Poland|pg||
nt|tomi2: they like to make "heavy" 1@S bids on 4 spades and some points|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: wow thats some double swing|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C hit the jackpot here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tez: 2@c dbl was not penalty for sure|pg||
nt|vbman: so north hand is close to 1sp or a q|pg||
nt|tomi2: east should pass as long as he is not doubled and later think of correcting to 5@D|pg||
nt|3for3: declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|3for3: defense can build 2@H's and take 3 aces|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tez: i would bid 3@c with west hand..you?|pg||
nt|tomi2: while this 2@S bid may be standard in USA or France, this is a 1@S bid in Polish methods|pg||
nt|tomi2: this will be no fun for west|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello everyone!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duking the D risk Q@D @d ruff losing after the K@D|pg||
nt|vbman: taking the low road resulted well|pg||
nt|vbman: if they played in nt it wd be a 15 point difference|pg||
nt|vbman: operator what are ns talking now?|pg||
nt|tez: if pikus discard @d..down 3|pg||
mb|1C|nt|nagini: felt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: my asistant says ''we say "side suit first" :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most of the breaks will be because most Polish players smoke - so they need a short time in such 12 board matches|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tomi2: even if he went down it would gain lots of imps since NS made 4@S over there|pg||
nt|pfbr: "assistant" :)|pg||
nt|nagini: personally I would choose  pepsi a pd|pg||
nt|vbman: smoking kills|pg||
nt|tomi2: this hand is easy in polish club, you open 1@C and start counting your points. For EW here 1@C is a limited opening, so Jagniewski had to guess or count his points first before ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: in vuln normal 3@h opening|pg||
nt|nagini: one condition only: as my sponsor:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: light openung|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: the best movement for the players was "4-board BAM swiss" so they had to wait for the other results and couls smore every 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: players was talking about previous board|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think with wests hand you should not force your partnership to the 5th level if you start the match leading in the 25 VP margin|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: pepsi has a feeling in fingers:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad controls isnt worth 12|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but I by today's standards, it's pretty sound -- a couple of 10's, and a couple of honor tricks make up for the acelessness.|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, if you can get them to take a phantom save, vul, it does have its merits.|pg||
nt|tomi2: you already need a good dummy to cause s relative flat score compared to passing 4@H with those two major aces|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42: good correction to 5@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if partner cannot open 2@S, probably the suit is insufficient|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: 2@D of course is multi - long @h or @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: if 4@H was making you need to escape for -3 maximum to have a relatively flat board|pg||
nt|tomi2: while you need a huge dummy to turn a bad baord into a good one - but this will not bring you more VP tan you already have|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tomi2: but it riscs going down more or going down while 4@H was not making - in those scenarios you lose imps. so IMO bidding can win very seldom but lose very often|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|tomi2: the players don't know the running score but they know the score after 12 boards|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|othered1: Effective double by north.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be worried about @C now|pg||
nt|othered1: He can hold this to -1 with the right view on the minor suit positions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but might take a wrong view on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is to give the A in @D - cab be usefull for the lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0549.JPG North|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry wrong link, this was south|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0550.JPG this is north|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tomi2: and they already had one board where they might expect to win imps and one where they might lose, wo it was not unlikely that the result was still 25-x at that point|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0569.JPG east|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|3for3: north needed to stay off hearts until south lead them.  |pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: Agree.  I wonder if the lead will give him an idea of the shape of the hand.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|egezzer: Hi everyone |pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|tez: smith echo was need here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|pfbr: Morning, Roland@h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NS must take their 5 tricks now|pg||
nt|nagini: @h|pg||
nt|3for3: they needed better signalling between the first heart and the club played, as to whether the ten was falling |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|tomi2: I guess this was a puppet stayman sequence, 3@C asked for majors, 3@D= at least one 4 card major, 3@H=spades 3@S=fit 3NT is forcing then showing interest in slam|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vbman: so does anyone think the current score must be told to the players?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: not ruffing high is a pretty extreme position here|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@C,4@D cuebids 4NT RKCB 5C=0 5@D=@SQ?. 5@S probably =yes I have|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5nt now should ask for kings, but I am not 100% sure about their methods|pg||
nt|tez: where is T of @h..its important for defence|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42: this will be tough to get right ruff high and double finesse|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0541.JPG this is Vainikonis|pg||
nt|jkotor: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: at least they spend a lot of time in the BBO practise rooms, so they know their system :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tomi2: wil he play now for some miracle-squeeze?|pg||
nt|po-s: 6c most likely asking for CQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe 5@S already showed one king and with none he would bid 6@S|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hT|nt|Gerben42: sorry no finesse needed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: another big swing to Unia|pg||
nt|othered1: Compared to the auction in the othe room, the one here looks perfectly normal.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or was the ugly 1N opening very specialized?|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a weak one I guess|pg||
nt|othered1: -2?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white on red|pg||
nt|egezzer: hi Jakub|pg||
nt|egezzer: Nice to see here that Konrad Araszkiewicz and Dariusz Kowalski. Impossible to watch for me them until in 12th World Championship Verone 2006(Open Pairs) and played very well ...|pg||
nt|egezzer: actually|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  would he like to have bit of rest now? :-)|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SKQJ and 5 hearts with west|pg||
nt|tomi2: with semi-friendly clubs and the marked @D finesse 6NT should make. @C10 is dropping, so the 9 will be a trick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|po-s: I think with side king + SQ he wouldm bid his king, but having shown DK already he only bid 5S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D could have been a singleton|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0506.JPG here you can see Olanski as well|pg||

pc|c3|nt|tomi2: Russian coul have ducked the heart to cut the communication here|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 6@H |pg||
nt|Gerben42: in theory you can also play in @C but less obv.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with @HK 4th its hard to play this one though but you want to be in it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: assume a @S lead you play directly @H to 10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here np with AQJ@C in the dummy, but in other situation it is important|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|3for3: excellent 6@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: when @HK wins your problem is gone: @DA draw @H and run @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D MULTI (6 cards in one major)|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt look like it will be too difficult to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And these guys know the percentage play in spades, cashing the ace first|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|nagini: NS play Mozart im mjrs:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s @s and minor weak hand i think|pg||
nt|nagini: minimulti 6 + mjr|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: @HA @HQ even better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which would be wrong at matchpoints|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: you have all intermediates|pg||
nt|jcmax: Transfer bids over 1@C openings are becoming increasingly popular.|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h MEANS Ý HAVE 1s2S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ralfwil: 33 points on EW but no slam as far as I can see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably rdbl have another means (not A @D)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: N's 2@S response doesn't promise anything extra, it just confirms the possession of 4 cards in @S|pg||
nt|tez: @s's i mean|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D =shortness..|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ralfwil: but made in CR|pg||
nt|tomi2: again some "Hamman" 3NT try, this time stopped by west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
nt|nagini: classic polish bluff|pg||
mb|5S|nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: wow|pg||
nt|jcmax: without key card Blackwood, one might get to a grand slam here :)|pg||
mb|6S|nt|nagini: as smart as pepsi?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
nt|vbman: push board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: am quite suprised that Russian did not bid 2@D after 1@S - that is a GF relay promising at least 3 card support in @S and enough for game|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: At IMPs you will play as safely as possible to make your contract, hence @SA is correct play|pg||
nt|tez: he didnt show void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at matchpoints, however, you must try to make as many tricks as possible, so finessing the queen is the right play|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, surprising, since partner's ace of @D could have been the K@S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
nt|tomi2: skipping the 2@D relay often indicates a) not such good 3 card support and/or b) a better heart suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: this to give the possibility to defend knowing a minimum of 3 cards |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rest assured that Jagniewski will cash @SA at trick 2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|tez: is it real or need undo|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: at first trick W small dimond and E 8 od dimond|pg||

mb|4H|nt|nigel_k:  If you play diamonds first and they break you now have 11 tricks and can play for a squeeze|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = max 3 cards support|pg||

nt|nagini: imagine|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|tomi2: if south had a better @H stopper and not such great fit, he would bid 3nt over 3@C directly|pg||
nt|tez: ty Monika|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so 420|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer may not read the lead as short, but it shouldn't matter as cards lie|pg||
nt|jcmax: It's not clear to me what the correct action with the N is. 4-card support for partner and relative shortness in @S seem to call for action.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: then South will also score his @H10|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No, I stick to the 4321 scale but I am no fan. It is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|tomi2: Let me try to introduce the format they are playing here. This is the Polish Premiere League. 16 Teams play a compleate round robin on thwo weekends, so they will finish sunday but ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: then the "fun" will start. The field will be torn into groups of 4 - basicly its most important to be top 8 after sunday|pg||
nt|jcmax: Interesting decision not to lead a @C here.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tez: but we are sure he will lead @d ace or @s ace|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: normal lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a kinitz told me 2NT is GF|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C would be nmf. I guess they play some GF checkback or so|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tomi2: then the teams will play one "K-O" against teams from their group, the first 8 may still become Champions, the last 8 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
nt|tomi2: south just shows a balanced hand with 6 clubs and probably 3@S and not a good heart stop. interesting what north makes with those information havin 2 hearts only too|pg||
nt|tomi2: should Olanski do something here?|pg||
nt|nagini: gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C=any invit hand 2@D=any GF hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: take @c play @h first..you can make it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H = invite, 2Nt=GF both with raise in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a interesting option|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tomi2: playing this method south was not able to show a good/bad hand. he has 3 kings and one ace, but could have had some queens and jacks|pg||
nt|tomi2: and since he opened 1nt on AKAK last hand he cant have more than this|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting choice by South to bid game with what loks like a lot of worthless black cards and bad trumps, the DQ as the only plus value - but lucky|pg||
nt|po-s: 3rd hand openings don´t deny an opening...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|trotto:  2@d = ask , 2nt 6 clubs , 3 @d relay ,  3@s= 3226 = , 4 @d - end signal( call P for bid 4 @h) 4 @s  = game @s sign off|pg||
nt|trotto:  tuszynski after  3 @s  bid knew about risky  to play  3 N    doubletons @h mirror|pg||
nt|nagini: i would prefer yo play longest suits... but whathever yuo wish sir:)|pg||

nt|3for3: ns are steaming along here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcmax: Will W dbl a 1@D opening?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@S down on a club ruff|pg||
nt|tomi2: they are getting close to the 25 VP border with another 12 boards to be played after a short break|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|Walddk2: 1@H spades again|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: h game but how to bid it?:)|pg||

mb|2H|nt|juror1: butler scoring http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/liga/liga2010-11/pierwsza/LIbutler.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I have been in worse games. I am a little surprised that Koto did not bid more than 2|pg||
nt|frankaus: a lot of points in this deck|pg||
nt|nagini: i'm trembling when Tuszek is playing always:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a expert told me that 2Nt in the previous hand int's GF - i suppose it is NoGF, because need to have a bid to invite|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|nagini: see?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: easy:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nigel_k:  Need to find a tenth trick though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S must be careful in this contract|pg||
nt|nagini: then wht to win?:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A low heart from North works because you hold heart losers to one and can still ruff two diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But that is looking at all four hands of course|pg||
nt|tez: pls lead partners suit:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: close to open this , i wouldnt but I am a big non-fan of QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|po-s: It looks like they abandoned old Polish club and play transfers over 1club openings|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes and they dont open 1@C on very stong hands, so this 2nt becomes free for some conventional meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now he made up for it, but .....|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @DQ and @C KQ ill not be such gr8 assets|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Olech still has to guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as they lead low from a doubleton in Poland|pg||
nt|nagini: Apek will do ... technics:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: a kib points out, that we are playing only black suits here all the time. What happend to good old hearts and diamonds? :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 18-20 he would rebid 1NT, with a weak NT hand 1@H|pg||
nt|po-s: Then 2NT might show either or.... or perhaps just clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: think he is too:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so I'm with Klimacki |pg||
nt|Gerben42: p 1m 4@H sounds perfect :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d probably only with 5 cards|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi |pg||
nt|tomi2: Apek is not playing here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcmax: Great lead!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: this 4@S cuebid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tomi2: 1@D shows hearts in their methods|pg||
nt|drewsky: where u gonna live ?|pg||
nt|drewsky: sorry, private|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Since West has short diamonds there is a serious risk of going down with trumps 2-2 if you don't play them immediately|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Warren :)|pg||
nt|juror1: welcome Warren again :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4nt rkbw|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: nice start for declarer|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: @DJ should do the trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North know A or Ax in S in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H ask the Q in @D|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|nagini: nice|pg||
nt|nagini: - 1 only:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: it is Dariusz Kowalski|pg||
nt|nagini: wow|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: many bid 5@S = no Q, 5Nt = Q, 6@C = Q + 1K etc.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: When declarer follows with the queen, the jack is a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now seven with K in @h|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer may not have enough communication though to "misguess" the trump suit|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good defence to continue trumps|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree with declarers line though it didn't work - this is usually the case only when I am declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like as S should have played a @s in trick2|pg||
nt|warrens:  trying for 7, but I don't think he'll make 6 |pg||
nt|po-s: if 3H showed spade values why did he ignore his heart values?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tez: we will see endplay soon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Gerben42: maybe with good intermediates I would open it anyway - depends on mood |pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: yes, hard also 6|pg||
nt|tomi2: whatever their bids mean, they play a good contract rightsided now. he has one discard on @H at least and one on spades, so it does not need @D finesse. and with this lead he even ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: survives 4-0 trumps|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nagini: dead  man:)|pg||
nt|tez: no need endplay sry|pg||
pc|c2|nt|warrens:  if declarer plays spades by trying to cash the Ace, he's down for sure, but I think he's down even if he plays towards dummy (assuming East ruffs)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|warrens:  if he plays a spade, East ruffs and plays another trump.  now declarer has 5@D, 2@S, 2@H and 1@C.  can't even ruff one spade since East can ruff again|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bridge_one: no way in all lines to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|warrens:  yes, win first trump, play a club toward dummy, take 3@S, 2@H, 5@D and 2@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: this 2 nt showing 19/20 i thk|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D a great bid !|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 2@D might be a transfer to hearts, showing some at least mild invitational hand. playing this method 2@H becomes "GF in @D". quite popular in the Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: better idea|pg||

nt|nagini: = just made|pg||
nt|trotto: because kibs are still asking for Kowaski-Tuszynski's system, I'll explain: after several relays when the distribution is known, 3nt is to play, 4@d is artificial, forcing to ...|pg||
nt|trotto: mandatory 4@h (and then pass on any bid of P) , while 4@c/4@h/4@s / 4nt are preferential blackwoods|pg||
nt|tez: other table bid 3 nt..brave @h|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: passing a easy 3Nt (lead @H...)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Next set at 12.00 local time, in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|frankaus: what sort of polish name is that  - it even has a vowel or 2|pg||
nt|trotto: bd   10|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like E/W will scramble to 4@S or 5@C|pg||
