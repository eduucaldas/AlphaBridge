mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|stc: which is a symbolic name, nobody in the team plays in LCF :)|pg||
nt|doctorone: 6@s missing 2 key cards is... well, a choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|stc: it's 50% and you have to play it when trailing by 50|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: and going down in 5@s is really unfair :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|doctorone: 50% slam are rarely 50% and you see here it fails via the @h ruff :):)|pg||
nt|legend114: hard to avoid slam: duplication with Clubs AKQ pretty much worthless|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@C East in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: yes if they awaken the sleeping giant    they may create misery|pg||

nt|me argent: wold is conflicted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but since scoring is BAM EW must bid again  each board is just win/lose/draw|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C!|an|relay|nt|ahollan1: BAM is Board-A-Match  aka Point-A-Board|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Yes but here, Wold stole Helgemo's bid|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: So that lead-directing overcall worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want team rosters [and carryover at start of day]  check out bottom of http://www.acbl.org/nabc/results/2010/03/4/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: teams have decimal totals because of carryover calculated from Day 1 and Day 2  [field cut each day]|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Some specs were suggesting 1)That S might have opened 2N  or 2) over 3@s, South might haved Xed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bridgewinners site doesn't include results from last round/match of Reisinger/National Swiss prior to break|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS playing for team Rosenthal     EW  team Fleisher|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: so we are out of luck for this bd 4; should resume as normal with bd 5|pg||
nt|daman: Stansby has a shot at Player of the Year depending how he does in this event vis-a-vis Brad Moss in the North American Swiss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the board you see is the board being played as bd 4 in all the other matches;  i don't know what happened to require a substitute bd here|pg||
nt|daman: the specs tell me Stansby needs to be 8th or higher to win the PoY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 10 teams in the final|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 39 teams entered the event;  after one day reduced to 20; after yesterday reduced to 10 for the finals|pg||
nt|me argent: tough event |pg||
nt|ahollan1: National Swiss reduction even more drastic|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Probably the toughest, because of the deep cuts.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- site just showing top 10  but 36 teams in the final of the Swiss|pg||
nt|daman: well    I think we are up todate on the PoY  with the help of the specs    Stansby   Sontag   and Brogeland are the only 3 in the running     when Moss DNQ in the Reisenger he was ...|pg||
nt|daman: eliminated     I thought he could drop down to the NA Swiss    not so|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Brad Moss, that is.   Mike is playing in the Reisinger today|pg||

nt|USBF:  Reisinger standings after 10 rounds:  1.Cayne 19.72; 2.Smirnov 159.34; 3.Bathurst 17.77;  4.Rosenthal 17.28; 5.Jacobus 16.25;6.Gordon 16.19;    7.Fleisher 15.00; 8.Moss 14.34; 9.Strul 14.1110. Jacobs 13.65;|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: problem may not be with convention -- but the decision to use it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: i bet Stansby would NOT open 4@D in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: a couple of minutes until rd 3|pg||
nt|daman: I always thought that you would not have an outside Ace when you tried Namyats|pg||
nt|me argent: conventions are there to be used and more importantly be abused|pg||
nt|daman: if partner had a red Ace and the @C King     it would be most unfortunate|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I think that w/Namyats, players can play it either way, the same sort of thing as in Michaels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each partnership defines which holdings are valid for Namyats|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Michaels used to be reserved for either very weak or very strong hands, but now players use it for all distributiuoonal hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think George Rosenkranz write-up was probably the most restrictive|pg||
nt|me argent: i put namyats rgt up there with playing transfers when using the weak nt|pg||
nt|me argent: well maybe not as high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I was incorrect about Board 5|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: The defense got a diamond ruff, so...|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Another win there for Rosenthal.|pg||
nt|me argent: cannot start next round until all teams finished |pg||
nt|me argent: hostage to slowest table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein went for 800 twice -- or was it 3 times |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the real problem is that players mill about and don't come to their table right away.  now 3 mins are already gone from the clock this round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told players DO get to compare with teammates between rounds -- what does panel think of this "barometer" type situation?|pg||
nt|daman: I think they got +800 and went for 800|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Kit|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :-) Hi Kit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, they are comparing after each round as of now|pg||
nt|warrens:  they provide the barometer scoring until the last few rounds|pg||

nt|sybarra: how do you get into the bidding Kit?|pg||

nt|USBF:  Reisinger standings after 13 rounds:  1.Cayne 25.72; 2.Smirnov 24.34;  3.Gordon 23.19; 4.Rosenthal 22.28;5.Bathurst 22.27; 6.Moss 20.34;7.Jacobus 20.25;8.Fleisher 18.50; 9.Strul 16.1110. Jacobs 15.65;|pg||

pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: In other room North led a club, so that will also be a question of overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner opening lead was @C7 and Weinstein covered @CQ|pg||
nt|kit: But there it went Q, K, A|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: Now -- might North have ducked king of clubs?|pg||
nt|kit: North is passed hand, presumably has A@H, K@D, Q@S, so no K@C|pg||
nt|me argent: the def already screwed up so maybe no finess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubtful -- then Demirev holds @HAK [otherwise Bramley opens the bidding]   AND lead 4th@H from garbage|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vdoubleu: Gordon has now moved up to 2nd|pg||

nt|cedrict: bien de laisser passe le @C|pg||
nt|cedrict: probably 9 tricks = 130|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: I can't remotely imagind bidding 4@S with Kx of hearts and only 3 spades|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But I think, as a spec just pointed out, this is a case of nerves here.|pg||
nt|dima:  Another violation of Burn's Law - one should try to have more trumps then opponents|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h7|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: Val -- the election is over   we have a few months where you can be totally honest|pg||
nt|me argent: thats not what east did considered he had no def so why not?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: lol|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: OK, then hopeless Al (adjective of choice)|pg||
nt|kit: However, after that lead may get out for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: much better|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, then, w./their teammates in 3@h......|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: -100 vs +140|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Easy win|pg||
nt|kit: but it doesn't look like 3@H is going to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no signs of nerves here behaviorally -- they are all quite seasoned, despite some of their relatively young ages|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: True|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Just looked again|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: they seem to have 5 losers|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, yes it will|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|kit: So the awful 4@S bid didn't cost at all.  Strange game, BAM|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner opened North hand 2@D    Nystrom in 4@S East|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I think Piekarek and Smirnov have played every session in this event; certainly every session in the past two days|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|dima:  Sorry they play variable NT so red 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|dima:  8 top tricks after the lead and not much of potential for more|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an| |nt|kit: anybody know what the double shows?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D was weak showing          @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: on 5@D he could have bid 5@H and then on 5@s 6@d, wasting less space|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an| |nt|cedrict: très sage tout ça :)|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|hedyg: 1@c= strong, 1@D 0-7, 2@s relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very nice @H layout for declarer|pg||
nt|dima:  If all the boards are like N15 you are better off with ski :)|pg||

nt|dima:  N14 has not been scored yet and this one looks good for La Chaux at this table|pg||
nt|cedrict: good @S lead anyway|pg||
nt|dima:  Well the absence of @d lead might tip that East has one top diamond|pg||
nt|cedrict: correct.. possible 6-7 imps on 14 for la Chaux|pg||
nt|hedyg: as well as to the Swiss Bridge Federation for bringing this event to BBO, especially to Bachar Abouchanab who was instrumental in organising these broadcasts|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Guess it is penalties |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: when asked about the X, Bramley shrugs|pg||
nt|cedrict: different game... but probably same result|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Rosenberg in 2@S North     Willenken bid 1N over the DBL instead of Demirev's pass|pg||
