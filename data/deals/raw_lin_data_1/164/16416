nt|brolucius: It could also be 18+ points.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D means that he does not want to play in clubs, even if this is South's long minor. So, he expects partner will play in his major.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: if he knew partner had 6 clubs he would probably prefer the 6-1 fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: A triumph for the weak 2@D - gets them to a 3-3 fit all the time :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure the NPC will approve|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Violating his law|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: East does have a problem after (2@D)-Dbl-(P)- |pg||
nt|brolucius: England might play in spades at both tables - not usually a recipe for an entry in the plus column.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is it too simple to bid your longest suit?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps East should have bid 2@C (if available), even if West might be short. The general rule is that you should bid straight away, saying your piece, when you are weak.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I mean, East has four clubs and only three spades|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: But after (2@D) Dbl (P) 3@C presumably shows some values|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: That's really quite well bid. If diamonds were coming in, they would take a great score.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a bad choice by N-S here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: But will he get diamonds right?|pg||
nt|brolucius: An aggressive rebid from North, who was facing a past hand.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Any reason to finesse the 10?|pg||
nt|henryb:  one from the 1920's? or even earlier?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Other than it is winning|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d5|pg||

nt|henryb:  Bridge is like life: every once in a while a little rain must fall :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can duck a spade and hope for a club back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The best line after a club back is probably to duck a spade first, is it not?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed he is not yet down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That gives him two chances|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|pc|d9|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Club to the ace and another. Then duck a spade|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: But they have to do it - Short should play @CJ on the second round to tell partner he does not have @CQ|pg||

nt|athene: i don't have the EW system - weak notrump, 4-card majors is pretty popular in scotland but we will see|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: NS are playing a Carrot club (11-13 bal or 17+)|pg||
nt|idc: "no defections", heh, I like it Ronan|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose after the double you might finesse the diamonds but it's asking quite a lot|pg||

nt|athene: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: silvertexter|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: indeed, both Dbl and NT are available for the other suits|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose that makes more sense where people open 1@H with 10xxx :)|pg||
nt|justin c: if W can have 4 small, you cant get shut out with a good hand with @H|pg||
nt|justin c: as you say, lots of takeout bids available|pg||
nt|chick: oh, nevermind, it wasn't the opening bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes NS play 2-way 1@C opener, 14-16 nt, upside down carding|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: it was sime who was thinking there|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|milton_se: very timid pass by South|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: EW are strong notrump, 5-card majors, weak-2@D@H@S, standard count, upside down attitude|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sheila a: I think I prefer 2@d from Sime's hand - if partner has 4 @h it's easy for him to bid them|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: garvey decides 2@D is a nice spot to stop - of course with his partner being a passed hand there is less danger of missing game, passing a transfer|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: I don't mind the double - but perhaps East should just bid 2N, or West settle for 3@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: forcing with support or balanced|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mikeirl: no defence to beat this|pg||
nt|sheila a: 3@c = minimum|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South worried about the diamond stopper|pg||
nt|sheila a: I presume partner could have asked about majors if he wanted, so his cards should be in minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: well judged|pg||
nt|peachy: I suspect Dbl was takeout oriented|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes well timed and really good defense to beat game double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Walker has shown 12-15 bal|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cuttysark: It seems you can ake 6@C by ruffing finesse against @DA to pitch 2 spades|pg||
nt|sheila a: I wouldn't want to be in it|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 5@H has good chance to make|pg||

nt|chick: who should double? :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|justin c: doubleton @CQ in the pocket, and the @HK right|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I expect it was bid as sac, insurance against potential making 4S|pg||
nt|justin c: friendly layout for dec|pg||
nt|mikeirl: would be uncomfortable on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: might make 12 tricks - for example on a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: Jxxx isn't all that appealing but if you think neither opponent has four, it's not so bad|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: declarer will be happy|pg||
nt|steveray: certainly not a testing contract to play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: Assuming 4@D is a Splinter, North cues? Or worried about his spade stopper?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to avoid being forced to open up the hearts, if they want four tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sheila a: It's an odd sequence if S really did show minimum and N signed off in 3NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: ah now it makes more sense|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if North couls sign off in 4n?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|sheila a: Shows the value of interfering with the opponents' NT|pg||

nt|athene: saying i have nothing wasted in diamonds, facing the shortage|pg||

nt|diumraid: For Live In Running Scores at all tables got to http://bridge.silvertexter.eu then "browse results" then 1o3.txt|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mikeirl: another flat board|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: probably 3@S was a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: either to play there or the start of some minor suit slam try|pg||

nt|sheila a: Sorry, the W hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Would everybody respond 1@H as East? They play Walsh, but with game values they can bid diaonds first. If West had reslised that perhaps he should bid 4@H, having already shown 3 ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: diamonds with a Suport Dbl|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would Pass the West hadn, then when partner re-opened with a dbl I could bid hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: Perhaps EW are in fear of playing in another 4-3 fit |pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: Long explanation over what the 6@s meant|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulhac:  Probably worried that 3@C would not be forcing|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: Mark can have a sigh of relief, troubles are over|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT  for running scores|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's can bid 2@D shows a sound raise to (at least) 2@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Patterson is North    Short  East|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bidding NT instead will not work well.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|brolucius: 2@H is a transfer to spades.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D  11-15, 0+ diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Crouch takes advantage of this method, doubling to suggest a lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I would have thought the double of 2@h should be a strong hand, not lead directing|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East will not consider bidding NT now, after the heart-showing double. He invites a spade game with 3@S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  maybe strong distributional in the context of a strong club|pg||
nt|brolucius: He could bid 2@S with such a hand, perhaps.|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: weird|pg||
nt|jtr: er|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: so 4@s went down one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't explain the 1@c opening with six hearts, unless EW have switched to Little Major |pg||
nt|jtr: Or the protective double|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: 1 minute break  for kibitzers in the Club, a bit crowdy here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe a Hobgoblin (which I am drinking) got at that hand|pg||
nt|justin c: was expecting a @H exit|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Board 27 has them in 5@S going one off|pg||
nt|idc: At the end of the hand he'll wish he had bid something non-forcing :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Well 3@C should be forcing|pg||
nt|idc: Ok, we have caught up with the other room for these last 2 bds|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: Will they also bid the right game on Board 12?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|justin c: after which he may go off, playing for @DQ in N|pg||
nt|justin c: (knows the @DA in S of course)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT seems to have little chance on a diamond lead   but was made in CR|pg||
nt|idc: this is tough to call - you need to find the @cQ to make game so could be a swing either way after Scotland stopped in partscore|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzxx: not the best set for Joneses|pg||
nt|chick: nope|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mikeirl: They're in 4@S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  West could not really have had any less for 3NT but I knew Peter would go for the @cQ|pg||
nt|justin c: the good news is that 9 tricks are available here|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can get a spade ruff now, for one down|pg||
nt|athene: (@HAQ, @CA, @CAK and the ruff)|pg||
nt|sheila a: unlucky to wrong side it|pg||
nt|mikeirl: this lead should defeat it by one|pg||
nt|athene: @DA sry|pg||
nt|athene: south might well have led a spade anyway, as nothing else looks really appealing|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings before the last round|pg||
nt|jtr: @h lead maybe|pg||
nt|justin c: the bad news is that the same 9 were available in 3NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Right they are - another 6 imps|pg||
nt|idc: Now, when I said you needed to find the @cQ, I was speaking about 4@s|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jtr: But then you make 10|pg||
pc|h3|nt|milton_se: no, but what should North do over 4S?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: unusual that Scotland haven't scored an imp n this round so far |pg||
nt|idc: 3NT needs a different set of things to happen before it makes|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sheila a: Interesting balance by Matheson|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|jtr: No|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  10 tricks after the lead|pg||
nt|peachy: than more good new, the other table didnt bid 3NT either |pg||
nt|peachy: *news|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it surprised me that South did not open - he opens a lot of 11 counts|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: yes, and another 5 here they aren't going to score|pg||
nt|athene: @H9 a trump peter, showing 3 trumps and a desire to ruff something, i guess|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: 4N?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|jtr: Just lose 3@ds 1@c|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 3NT comes home as defence get end played   declarer cashing the spades the defence is forced to play hearts after the diamonds   |pg||
nt|sheila a: The defence will be able to get their @s ruff|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: with @SJ dropping, @s9 is an entry|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|ady: yes     that as wsell   but can make even if J@S does not drop|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will probably run this|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: i.e. "carry on with spades, pd" :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or they can try the forcing game|pg||
nt|sheila a: Following suit is also a winning tactic :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d8|pc|c6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jtr: Really a @h?|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: yes|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jtr: My head is starting to hurt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: have a beer, David|pg||
nt|milton_se: even if you don't like splintering with an ace, South's hand required more than 4S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jtr: If this carries on Hemlock might be better:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: Still only 8 tricks but having started that way, I'm sure the defence will want to let declarer have the ninth|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: 4@S shows 20 points, 45xx distribution, and N had minor help in hearts|pg||
nt|milton_se: exaktly|pg||
nt|chick: so I blame N|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: claim|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
mc|9|nt|paulhac:  A chance missed for scotland|pg||

nt|henryb:  but declarer would almost certainly have guessed it anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@H - 1@S - 2NT - 3NT is a possible auction.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  cards certainly lie well for E-W|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: 2NT leaves room for a 5-3 fit in a major to be discovered. An old-fashioned 3NT rebid would not.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the modern meaning of a 3N rebid is that opener has an old-fashioned ACOL 3N opener: a long solid suit and some side cards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: most play it that way, yes|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  And with the gradual weakening of the 2N opener, you don't find many balanced 20 counts being opened one of a suit|pg||

nt|sheila a: It appears that E opened 4@s in 3rd seat on board 12|pg||
nt|athene: 4 imps sorry - they were NV so only 50|pg||
nt|athene: i would open west a 20-21 or 20-22 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Which made sure of not missing game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well that gets the job done!|pg||
nt|idc: to be fair to me, I was looking at the screen through a red mist ... sigh|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lots of aces and a 5-card suit - not even minimum for 2nt in my opinion|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: A very excellent job by our vugraph operator Marcin!! |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S  on a finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: err...|pg||
nt|ady: assuming no heart ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: replay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|an|18-19|nt|mdgraham: action replay, no less|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jtr: North cant move|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if he does he will find out that they are off 2 keycards|pg||
nt|sheila a: Sime's opening ran the risk of keeping NS out of a non-making game|pg||
nt|mikeirl: imps for Scotland on Board 28 - E/W are in 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: you might even consider rising the @HK here, to start clubs from the right side|pg||
nt|athene: on the grounds that the spades are more of a worry than the hearts anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: True|pg||
nt|justin c: double at other table, looking for @S lead|pg||
nt|sheila a: It looks like an opening bid to me, to be fair|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: I agree - these 5-5s just have to be opened|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sheila a: Feisty double from Matheson|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, they got every chance to stay out of it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Singleton in partner's suit and a trump trick - good combination|pg||
nt|sheila a: But Sime is thinking .....|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He pulled a double yesterday to a game he just might have made - hopefully he has learned something|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 5@D is trouble!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|sheila a: Phew!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to trust partner in these situations - gives you the shouting rights|pg||
nt|sheila a: That's the danger of doubling for one off - you give your partner another chance to bid :)|pg||
nt|idc: Two specs have asked the sensible question about the defensive carding last hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: I think Matheson is hoping for at least 2 down|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: normal to lead to a big one first with that suit, if you have enough entries to dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|milton_se: no way to nine tricks unless South lets go of a spade -- or they set up a H|pg||
nt|athene: gain against Ax onside or stiff jack offside|pg||
nt|athene: ok that was last i think? thanks all|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mikeirl: leads to 15/15|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: While this hand is taking its twelve winners, a genreal point: |pg||
nt|chick: heart will work though|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jtr: Slight risk in taking the trump finesse|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only half way, Michael, lots more excitement to come :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 13 Walker managed to make 2@s, despite the 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes - solid bridge played here|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|milton_se: 10D is killing|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|sheila a: Double part score swing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|milton_se: no! not any more...|pg||
nt|chick: I think he can still do it|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: I note that Short did not open the North hand :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some of us play K for count and Ace fot attitude|pg||
nt|idc: so I should reply that I would encourage as North (high in their system)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sheila a: Does that earn him a brownie point from you?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark: Half a mark|pg||
nt|mikeirl: will Garvey lead a low @C now?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: S is squeezed in spades and hearts|pg||
nt|idc: but that I can't imagine not playing @hK at trick 2 as SOuth were I to decide to continue the suit|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Better had, I think|pg||
pc|c9|nt|peachy: this was the last bd of the set, next set schedule after about 15 min break|pg||
