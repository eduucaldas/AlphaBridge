nt|djneill:  rehi all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Dan.|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Best to avoid 3NT here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play a home-grown strong club system known as the Delberto Club |pg||
nt|idc: The 1@h was alerted - it is natural but may conceal a longer @d suit if fewer than about 11/12 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: one of the players filing a fingernail|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I won't say who|pg||
nt|milton_se: not easy to find 4H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: good morning Bertil|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 1@C has several meanings, I assume here it is  16+ HCPs, unbalanced|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi again Rory.|pg||
nt|djneill:  re-whoa|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|georgia19: 3nt of course, is cold - as usual|pg||
nt|milton_se: maybe a double would be better (if not defined as penalty)|pg||
nt|milton_se: now the Hs seem out of question|pg||
nt|chick: so at this point, N still doesn't know what kind of hand S has|pg||

nt|sheila a: 4@h looks fine|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome everyone to this 3rd round Camrose match between England & Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: North in his box|pg||
nt|idc: Nice try by Brian Short to shut out West but Derek Patterson doesn't know the meaning of "shut out"|pg||
nt|mikeirl: was worth a 4@D bid surely|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 4 @S shuts if off but clear where W wants to play it |pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Michael |pg||
nt|toobad: 4d would certainly have been more descriptive|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Shirley |pg||
nt|mikeirl: and John|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think its tougher with a 2 @D overcall |pg||
nt|chick: I wonder how being so far behind will affect NS's bidding|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: diamond ruff may loom|pg||
nt|idc: The names as they stand are mixed up but better to get the first hand details right - we'll correct the names when we have time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable for West to bid both his suits - he has a fair hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: it's a pity 3@c didn't promise all those clubs - S would have raised then|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: not a nice easy board to get the brains going|pg||
nt|chick: 1@D 0-7 undefined suits|pg||
nt|golfsquash: I though he would go 4 there|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk7: Good morning Ralf and Bertil|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good morning everyone!|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and Peter, our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Good morning Ralf|pg||
nt|milton_se: my ordinary (junior) pard would hate this board 1 in the morning :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good morning Peter and Bertil|pg||
nt|milton_se: hej Ralf|pg||
nt|toobad: Welcome to the OK Corral|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Cornelia|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: 2@D is game force showing the 16+ unbalanced hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hard for East to realise that partner has an entry - but if the queen is dropped he should fins the switch|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sheila a: declarer can ditch second @c on a @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But then North can cross to @HA to discard a club. Oh well|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Top o' the mornin' all :|pg||
nt|sheila a: morning1|pg||

nt|idc: that's what prospective partners all say|pg||
nt|milton_se: welcome, John|pg||
nt|mikeirl: easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|vbman: not a direct raise to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mikeirl: England 17/13 against Ireland|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have the EW system - weak notrump, 4-card majors is pretty popular in scotland but we will see|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: NS are playing a Carrot club (11-13 bal or 17+)|pg||
nt|idc: "no defections", heh, I like it Ronan|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose after the double you might finesse the diamonds but it's asking quite a lot|pg||
nt|djneill:  there are ways to refine West's raise, but they did not have it, so they just guessed the wrong way, happens|pg||
nt|jcwla: Threading the needle is not the way to go at IMPs.  Here E knows with near metaphysical certitude that the counterpart will bid game.  If it were clear that nine tricks were the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: limit - or perhaps that they were too high already, that's one thing - but here no reason to pass up the 300 point bonus.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|idc: This is a fun-looking hand - can N-S reach slam?   and do they want to?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S is natural, possibly 4 cards in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|4C|nt|justin c: 2@H natural is the way to play here|pg||
nt|steveray: afternoon, Bill, Ian|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|djneill:  West is not using the big lead as an excuse to Pass|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mikeirl: silvertexter|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: indeed, both Dbl and NT are available for the other suits|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose that makes more sense where people open 1@H with 10xxx :)|pg||
nt|justin c: if W can have 4 small, you cant get shut out with a good hand with @H|pg||
nt|justin c: as you say, lots of takeout bids available|pg||
nt|chick: oh, nevermind, it wasn't the opening bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes NS play 2-way 1@C opener, 14-16 nt, upside down carding|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards leap off to the sky in my 2 cards suit when I double like that |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Hi Steve & Bill|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it was sime who was thinking there|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to take some hundreds|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: matehson experimenting with the 3-card rebid at a bad time - Sime also a bit pushy|pg||
nt|sheila a: I don't like the look of this contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: or I should say "some partners" |pg||
nt|toobad: McGann rarely leaps|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Great contract :)|pg||

nt|jcwla: Hi Julian.|pg||
nt|chick: true, but a 6 card suit with an outside entry is worth something|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idc: South hand may be too short of entries to make this a good one|pg||
nt|georgia19: wonder how many they'll make, apart from the (normal) @d break, everything is perfect|pg||
nt|sybarra: couldnt we all feel he was dying to take another bid |pg||
nt|toobad: no lol|pg||
pc|c5|nt|milton_se: very timid pass by South|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: EW are strong notrump, 5-card majors, weak-2@D@H@S, standard count, upside down attitude|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sheila a: I think I prefer 2@d from Sime's hand - if partner has 4 @h it's easy for him to bid them|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks like all it needs is a 3-3 break and @CA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: John having a think now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: about playing @sQ?|pg||
nt|milton_se: tell him it's too late :)|pg||
nt|toobad: team instructions!!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|djneill:  it's going to bring in 6 tricks and a nice result|pg||
nt|djneill:  I rise and drop the doubleton @cQ :-)|pg||
nt|chick: can I be your partner? :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  who am I , West or North|pg||
pc|cA|nt|idc: I expect that however many it is, it'll be too many for their peace of mind|pg||
nt|sybarra: he loves his hand but just no hcp's|pg||

nt|idc: well, I did mention that only 1 spade ruff was needed - great though the defence was I suspect that Peter will feel he ... could have done better|pg||
nt|georgia19: all down to a bad decision at trick 1 with both finesses working, he declined one|pg||
nt|vbman: he made 9 and if the the king were off he wd be down|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: I think it "should" mean "nothing. With spade support and values, defending looks promising|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, I agree|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice set of nasty hands to start with (I hate 4441)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: not sure i would in 2nd seat and i open anything thay moves :)|pg||
nt|chick: if not for the bad heart split, NS might have a game with 16 HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north might consider breaking discipline and bidding 3@D here|pg||
nt|toobad: handy 3n|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only on S! E will find the @c lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could be an interesting play in the club suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  after a @h lead into the A-Q declarer has 8 on top|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Only legitimate defence is a club lead and heart switch|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @c lead an @h switch gives declarer no chance but hard to find|pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: I've got to run, thanks Bertil, Cornelia, and all kibs. Enjoy the rest!|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Raija @H@H!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This opening bid should get them to 3N, another contract I think I might make|pg||
nt|idc: Similar basic system for both pairs: strong NT, 5 card majors, weak Twos in majors|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzxx: lots of explanations now going on which I can't hear or see|pg||

nt|athene: you only go up with the queen there if you need two fast spade tricks - playing low has several benefits|pg||
nt|athene: one of which being west led from @SJ10 :)|pg||
nt|toobad: sounds good to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C the gam force or did Burns use as check back?|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR 17, W made a fit jump in @D after E's @S overcall and the @S game was duly reached.  6 to Ireland.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West has enough to open without the @cQ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Now the low club|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: *game|pg||
nt|toobad: all on the d hook|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: apparently some form of Gazilli?|pg||
nt|toobad: v popular|pg||
nt|vbman: must be careful now|pg||
nt|vbman: to play a trump|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good play at trick 1;  this contract could make|pg||
nt|chick: W must lead A and another @H to set this|pg||
nt|vbman: yes small seems not ok|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: 2@d is different: natural weak for Scots, undisciplined multi for English|pg||
nt|chick: small heart and N would get 2 black tricks and 9 trumps|pg||
nt|chick: 8* trumps|pg||
nt|vbman: must carefully count now, its very easy to go wrong in such hands|pg||
nt|chick: the only danger from N's point of view is W being able to overruff a diamond too soon, but as the cards lie, W will have to overruff the Q and still come to only 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|justin c: 5@C is a good bid here, whether it makes or is a good save against 4M the other way|pg||
nt|chick: I don't know what the XX meant, but S went pretty quietly for such a suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: I'm going for a coffee ...|pg||
nt|toobad: longest and strongest|pg||

nt|mikeirl: I've just consulted my Bridge Conventions Complete that Liz bought me a few years back - and it ain't in it!! :(|pg||
pc|c4|nt|justin c: bit unlucky that neither of those things happening|pg||
nt|justin c: 3 small @H in N is not what he wanted|pg||

nt|idc: maybe "undisciplined" is a bit unfair - weaker weak two than 2@h or 2@s perhaps better way to describe it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mikeirl: 2 sugars for me please :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|athene: yes, "undisciplined" usually means wide-ranging and unilateral, rather than specifically weak|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a: It snowed in Edinburgh last night, very chilly today|pg||

nt|mikeirl: so leading 4th @C would hardly cost|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  think I just caught East scoffing at the nebulous club|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: should be flat at 660|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you might get into 5@C one way or another|pg||
nt|milton_se: 3@H - 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: the Northern Irish are playing a form of Standard American|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: the southern Irish are playing carrot club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I like this 10!-13 balanced vul versus not|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|chick: NS can make 3N on a good day|pg||
nt|athene: south still has a very soft hand; he won't want to go past 3nt surely|pg||

nt|milton_se: would you bid 4@H with that flat hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No only an invite|pg||
nt|toobad: he will pass............ v slowly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: nice blank kings|pg||

nt|chick: well, today is a good day for it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: comfort break for east|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 4@s is a correct save|pg||
nt|chick: West did well to analyze out the @DK pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: could even be opposite partner;s void|pg||
nt|chick: .|pg||
nt|steveray: howsat?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: a cheeky smile and a 2d without his screenmate from sime|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: alerted|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzxx: and we back|pg||
nt|milton_se: y at most 500|pg||
nt|toobad: finds the s bid now when unsafe rather than when free, but it works|pg||
nt|vbman: yes indeed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there could be some guesswork in the @h suit|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 4@s gets interesting if they cash diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  now they not have cashed the @d the play is a lot easier|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a: 2@h = 3 card support|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This Irish pair open very light, but they will still reach 4@S - not a gimme|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: another thing is if you bid a game with som invite bid, you often will have no save|pg||
nt|milton_se: well judged|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: now Ian having a think|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|toobad: h finesse working  9 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|steveray: I thought Camrose was played without screens, am I behind the times?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vbman: surprise cl lead|pg||
nt|chick: N's failure to bid 2@S might suggest the @C as a better lead?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: north doesn't have a very nice 15 count but it is 15 and since he has presumably shown 12-14, he has to bid this|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: looks like a screen from here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|justin c: Cant blame W for giving this hand a look|pg||
nt|steveray: in the good old days when I played there were no screens in Camrose, even after they were used in other events|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That changed about 5 years ago|pg||
nt|steveray: tx Roland, I never knew:)|pg||
nt|idc: And they use paper-like cards now Steve, not those stone tablets anymore |pg||
nt|steveray: I thought it was all done virtually, with computers|pg||
nt|mikeirl: may have been considering which @C to lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sheila a: Needs the K@s onside|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now needs an intrs-finesse in spades - not the odds line|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (apologies for the poor typing)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: typing is fine :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And he probably does not have the entries anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with correct play 5@s is only -500|pg||
nt|toobad: this is what happens|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: this is safe because declarer's spades are just strong enough|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! 5 rounds of @c will give a trick to @sK!|pg||
nt|milton_se: not obvious to drop @SK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|justin c: @DA inatead of @DKQ in E|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: sry 4 rounds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|steveray: in fact it would be cheaper to play the Camrose online - good idea eh?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 10 on top now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He does now|pg||
nt|athene: at worst east can win the @HA and play the @S9 back, but you just cover, and the @S7 means you are never going down|pg||

pc|c8|nt|vbman: now its an open book|pg||
pc|d8|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|nt|toobad: and on 18 N reached the dizzy heights of 3nt all on his lonesome|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: the last making contract was some way back|pg||
nt|steveray: this could go off or get let in:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: sometimes hard to follow at the end of hands when they play in a blur|pg||
nt|milton_se: one finesse and a 3-3 break needed despite 26 hcp|pg||
nt|toobad: if Carroll's hand was 2533 would he really have given all that thought over 4H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: screens in use - W Hamilton could have been thinking about his 4@s, no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would have thought most would open 1@H with that east hand|pg||
nt|idc: good news for declarer: they didn't cash @s|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, no harm done|pg||
nt|idc: bad news: still too many losers in pointed suits|pg||
nt|athene: tricky to play - maybe cash just two clubs to get rid of one spade, then lead spades up to take advantage of @SJ onside? trying to have the best of both worlds|pg||
nt|milton_se: and also: Carroll might have 1-5-x-x w @SJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like Stayman|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|justin c: would rather put a red card on 4@S than try 5@C with N|pg||
nt|chick: I thought 5@D from N would have been better|pg||
nt|georgia19: c'mon Mike, what's the answer?|pg||
nt|idc: 1NT rebid I guess|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders have 4 top winners and will struggle to get more|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play this as drop dead and others as 5-4 inv'l.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|steveray: if Selway could see all 4 hands, he would be thinking it was a bit hopeless, but could try 2 rounds of clubs then try a @d|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 1@D...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: yes, bit short of entries to hand, i agree|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|idc: when I say 'guesss' - am reading their CC and 1NT is 11-13 and possibly singleton in partner's major|pg||

pc|dA|nt|justin c: 4NT for N, if you must bid anything|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|athene: declarer might duck this trick as well to rectify the count for a possible squeeze on north in clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|idc: he may be hoping for clubs 4-3, trumps 3-2 and a slow spade trick|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but not very likely since a) it would need north to have all three heart honours and b) the defence could break it up with a heart shift anyway|pg||

nt|mdgraham: such hardships you have|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East is less confident of a fit|pg||
nt|djneill:  North leaving VM for lawyer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@s doubled would be a few off|pg||
nt|djneill:  offices of May, Bee, and Short|pg||
nt|chick: so would 2@CX|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: bit of a discussion here between N and E,|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: director called|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS would have reached 3NT if they had a free run|pg||
nt|djneill:  sigh|pg||
nt|chick: maybe he thinks it's another psyche :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Once bitten, twice shy.|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Has east passed?|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: subtle sort of bid now from east, like 3nt :)|pg||
nt|golfsquash: east will pass!|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: so D Jones tried to pass, but I think Hanlon was surprised, thinking 1@s was forcing, and called TD before screen went back|pg||
nt|djneill:  amazing if 1@s shows rank, that West psyched prev with a possible 5-5 @h fit (and opps have nothing)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I think the TD has ruled result stands on the 4@dX board|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good ruling there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: still discussing here whether 1@s is forcing or not|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Yes, the 2 way club, weak or strong, adds another twist.|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if it was a psyche, it was a brave one but ruling seems correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5@C not the worst contract in the world here|pg||
nt|georgia19: but she's right, always drink the bad before the good ......my kind husband has already filled my glass - but I don't know with what, except it's red|pg||
nt|jcwla: Assuming the result on 19 does stand, with N/S failing by one in 4@S in the OR, it will be 12 more to Wales and the lead will go to 50.|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Is there a screen?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Welsh fans may like to know that the WBU has taken the lead in their match against Scotland|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: now west has to decide among pass, 4@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has to show that singleton diamond somehow though|pg||
nt|steveray: so where would we like to play this one, 5@c, major moysian,??|pg||
nt|idc: true - can they avoid matchpoint NT-itis though?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: quite possible that south will just suggest notrumps at some point and north will go along with it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that will do, usually|pg||
nt|georgia19: apparently it's Bandol, is it my birthday?|pg||
nt|jcwla: That was the only close match entering this segment.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: the SW side of the screen is blissfully unaware of what is happening :)|pg||
mb|2D!|an|likely some sort of checkback|nt|chick: E might have slam aspirations, but he doesn't have a bid to show it|pg||
nt|athene: there is a case for saying this should be specifically 6-4|pg||
nt|athene: ok, that will do the trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Paul Hackett|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now south is only playing in 5, 6 or 7 @C|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: i would bid 4@D with south now|pg||
nt|steveray: not even Matheson could manage those @d's|pg||
nt|athene: reverse splinter|pg||
nt|athene: saying i have nothing wasted in diamonds, facing the shortage|pg||
nt|toobad: 4 H EW hopefully|pg||
nt|vbman: the great dealer is capricious this set|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Did north get his pass recalled after east also passed?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North may be unsure whether to look for a @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: yes North's pass was allowed be recalled|pg||
mb|3C|nt|peachy: 7 controls, 5-card good major and 5-4 sort of speaks in favor of trump contract, but opposite that dummy, 3NT is best|pg||
nt|peachy: 8 controls, sorry|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, wrong again, I have to admit, I'd at least bid game|pg||
nt|milton_se: so he passed :) -- don't understand that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The Irish tend to open 1@C on most hands with their 2-way methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: i dont know their bidding methods here|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live In Running Scores at all tables got to http://bridge.silvertexter.eu then "browse results" then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: the logic would go something like:- you can't bid it on 5-4 because that is not enough shape to go past 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: i don't fancy either major-suit moysian, with the wrong hand getting forced|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S should be 4h suit forcing |pg||
mb|3N|nt|mikeirl: another flat board|pg||
nt|athene: but you can't be 5-5 because you didn't michaels / whatever|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think this will quite fetch|pg||
nt|georgia19: here I go again, i predict this will not make|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: probably 3@S was a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: either to play there or the start of some minor suit slam try|pg||
nt|athene: and east seems to be playing it for 6-4 rather than 5-5|pg||
nt|steveray: Hi Paul, belated Happy New Year|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|athene: south has a huge hand for a passed hand, facing short diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: at least it is interesting hands, yesterday was a little dull :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Perhaps EW should just shut their eyes and bid something over it|pg||
nt|athene: lucky clubs aren't 5-2 otherwise three rounds of clubs would promote a trump for one down|pg||
nt|idc: Other room has caught us up - I'm happy now since I get the minus scores immediately with no wait whatsoever.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he can't possibly be any better|pg||
nt|steveray: as long as it's spades.......|pg||
nt|toobad: 5c is one off|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West;s best lead against 3NT is a @d but hard to find|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzxx: patterson is playing waiter to the whole table|pg||
nt|georgia19: now what? small spade?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: off fetching teas and coffees|pg||
nt|idc: My guess is that Scottish npc said to make the English pay, and his team has misinterpreted it|pg||
nt|georgia19: he's a nice guy, actually, a rareity among the top players ( or is it rarity?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Carroll considering|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2 with best defence|pg||
nt|djneill:  if South can sever East's hand from Wests using the distributional information, East will eventually yield a club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  20 (when there potential for a club guess) was flat when West played the @cQ at Trick one |pg||
nt|golfsquash: No lead does huge damage|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: I would assume so too, in which case 3NT response likely conventional|pg||
nt|georgia19: careful, Ian, that was funny|pg||
nt|mikeirl: nice sequence|pg||
pc|sT|nt|justin c: not sure why he didnt prefer stayman tho|pg||
nt|justin c: even with that weak @S suit, 4@S could easily be better|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, interesting ... I'm guessing that 3@C was a generic forcing takeout, S bid NT with a stopper and then 4@C says bid a suit|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps a bit surprising this much havoc from the Crash-type bids but there was the incident on 19 and of course all in context of a big deficit for NS.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|steveray: sensible spot|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sensible contract|pg||
nt|idc: Be interesting to know if 2@c denies a major even as an unpassed hand|pg||
nt|athene: what was barry crane's rule about 2-way finesses? the queen lies over the jack in the majors?|pg||
nt|athene: or was it the other way round?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: I think 4@H would have been better than 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: X of 4 @C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: 4@cXX would have been interesting|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sheila a: Hard to blame anyone for passing on that W hand!|pg||
nt|mikeirl: they got there - well done - |pg||
nt|dima:  hi all|pg||
nt|toobad: a xx from Lindsay would have ben v interesting|pg||
nt|toobad: been|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|idc: If so, there's a lot to be said for forgetting about 4-3 fits where the lonmg hand gets forced, so 3@h & 3@s here may not be natural |pg||
nt|paulhac:  As he may have to ruff diamonds the percentage line is to play East for the Q unless he can get a count|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|steveray: not the obvious @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: you can't draw trumps and throw a heart on a spade and ruff hearts in dummy, so you have to try reversing dummy i guess|pg||
nt|athene: well you have a bit more elbow-room not being in six, of course :)|pg||
nt|golfsquash: This will be a tight finish|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer should be working out that West's second suit is hearts|pg||
nt|djneill:  East could not bid 2@c here over the double (I think) since that would be a pass/correct|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Against you only, it doesn't matter what the first suit is, the second suit could be anything."|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  playing on @h will set up an 8th trick and an endplay should produce a 9th|pg||

pc|d9|nt|cuttysark: Not a real criticism - just a wish for some action!|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: they may be surprised they won on the board|pg||
nt|djneill:  not the best outcome of the 5-5 overcall but he'll do it next time I'm sure|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh I'm sure they're hoping for more chances, it seems to have hit a nerve.|pg||
nt|djneill:  1@c 10-13 balanced?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if NS play a two-way 1@c then I guess they have to take the consequences|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I got confirmation from kib that 3S indeed was the only way to stop in 3NT, it asked opener to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: and now you are in a bit of trouble because someone might ruff in with the @CQ on a spade and cash the @HK|pg||
nt|idc: Good - a slam hand|pg||
nt|idc: so far those are the only kind that Scotland gains on|pg||
nt|djneill:  North is probably rearranging his cards so he will never have to open 1@c again|pg||
mb|1H!|an|5+!h, 10-16|nt|justin c: v good bidding method|pg||

nt|toobad: Scotland and Wales are drawing 38 apiece after 20 boards |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Is this ttoo good for a 2@C opener?|pg||
nt|georgia19: one is supposed to blether when the hands are boring, Ian, that's what we're here for in part|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt with only 4 @c tricks to the defence|pg||
nt|toobad: England are 27-14 up against WBU after 18 boards|pg||
nt|golfsquash: board 5?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  he has 5 @h this time|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|milton_se: can they avoid 6D now?|pg||
nt|idc: South could splinter (4@c) but has more playing strength than usual for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so maybe it was a bit trickier than it appeared|pg||
nt|idc: plus a good diamond suit, so I doubt he will splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Interesting 3@s - maybe 3@d would be NF|pg||
nt|georgia19: I don't agree: splinters only in oppo suit - prefer 4@d, fit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: Blackwood in a minute, one suspects|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: sorry board 5, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: It's almost too good for a 14-16 NT - this hand should play well|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lucky the club finesse works - a diamond switch now will ake him sweat|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or a spade and another heart|pg||
nt|sheila a: declarer's problem is entries to dummy but in practice the defence can't keep him out of there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or 4@h on 4-3!|pg||
nt|djneill:  it was 3442 but I saw him move a @d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|milton_se: good brakes|pg||

pc|d7|nt|athene: (declarer entertains mad dreams of making the contract of course - little does he know!)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|jcwla: 19 is in and the rest through 22 are pushes so Wales up 50 after six.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: can just build a club now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Now he does not need the finesse|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: now back to three down, losing two trumps and the @CQ too, as he can't get to dummy|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|justin c: hmm|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: still it's tricky for the defence - they may well run out of exit cards and end up having to help declarer out|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and a possible finess for @h8|pg||

nt|athene: or, of course, it might not be :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and makeable too|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Warren welcome|pg||
nt|djneill:  powerful 1NT opening (for 14-16)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  vigorous EW bidding might convince NS that their hands fit well|pg||
mb|3C!|an|requested|nt|athene: i don't know how EW play the double here|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland went an extra one off on Bd 6, so lead down to 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S here maybe.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sheila a: Garvey has to open 1@d on this type of hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But does he really have to rebid 1NT?|pg||
nt|sheila a: It appears to be the method|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Oh, yes, I see that he does :)|pg||
nt|athene: a lot depends whether you have a weak-2@D available|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H=major relay|pg||
nt|chick: or 4@H|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: now 2N would be 4@s invite|pg||
nt|djneill:  that 1NT could slap a 17-count around|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: Should get a killing spade lead agsint 4@H|pg||
nt|sheila a: As NS haven't promised any suits, probably best to play it as a balanced hand|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Aggressive double by Espen but perfectly reasonable|pg||
nt|toobad: get out of jail card there for NI ......... not easy for South|pg||
nt|chick: 14-16|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: yes, perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Again I beliee the dbl is 12-15 bal but has a 2nd option|pg||
nt|athene: a slightly wet pass of 1@H with south, in my opinion|pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: but it's a bit tricky to know what to bid|pg||
nt|djneill:  North got over that guilt trip the easy way|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@C must be some kind of checkback and 2@H denies 3 spades (my guess)|pg||
nt|sheila a: But what would E lead against 3NT?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 9 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: An awkward little spot, this|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: not now :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 9 tricks after they make 5?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Boo.|pg||
nt|jcwla: N and S had three chances to cuebid.|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Like the earlier hand where 7@h was a good contract|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mikeirl: what 5 cud they take Liz?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Garvey never alerted 4@c|pg||
nt|georgia19: Steve in mourning as Stevenage have scored - twice|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi.  the hand looked easy to make at the end, but I'm not surprised he played tor West to have both|pg||
nt|sybarra: so much easier for us at the perspective|pg||
nt|toobad: exactly|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: that 4@h jump is not in my copy of the system |pg||
nt|toobad: but he gave it a good go|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: with both 3-card spades and 4-card hearts, many will bid hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: I wonder what Garvey's 3@s bid meant - just a fragment?|pg||
nt|toobad: best lead for def|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and declarer must play a @s from dummy  in trick2|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|justin c: 3NT dodgy here for NS|pg||
nt|georgia19: how good is 6@s?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: I prefer hearts, but I noted the alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: question re 2@H bid|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C wasnt alerted, but maybe it actually was at the table|pg||
nt|justin c: assuming East leads a @D here,|pg||
nt|justin c: dec will knock out the @HA|pg||
nt|justin c: after which he has 8|pg||
nt|justin c: from there, wants to cash the AK of one black suit, then finesse in the other|pg||
nt|sheila a: Nice alert!|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Garvey's words not mine :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|justin c: (if the Q didnt drop)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: well you unblock the @DKQ, throw a spade on the @CK, ruff a club, and sort of beaver along, i suppose|pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: much guessing|pg||
nt|justin c: nasty|pg||
nt|peachy: for declarer|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Both 4H and 5C had rasonable play but with the QC wrong.......|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sheila a: Against 3NT defence could take 4 @s and switch to a @d - that should take it off, no?|pg||
nt|athene: goodbye @CK, now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sheila a: S must be tempted by K@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: was wondering about 6@c too - not all that brilliant |pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: not comfortable for N?|pg||
nt|toobad: If W had the Kh on the last hand he would have opened............. an on the ball spec has pointed out!! Well noticed|pg||

nt|milton_se: @CK, @S ruff and @D finesse as last resort|pg||
nt|milton_se: would mean some 65%|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcwla: A grand ain't happening but I would expect this to be a loss board for Ireland, at least with the chances they had the way this auction went it ought to be.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes I remember that one|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: now ace and a spade|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|athene: the defence get 3 more trump tricks one way or another|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: The boards in the segments I've watched have been exciting - some tournaments you get nothing but dull hands.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sheila a: best to ruff this and ruff a @d high|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|djneill:  North applying pressure, finds the @d 4-4 so can just play a @h rather than risk @s hook|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|idc: While 3@c may have gone down, it wouldn't be an unreasonable line to win @s lead, cash AK @c and then pich dummy's @s on a heart|pg||
nt|chick: now N knows that E has only 1 diamond to cash and the spade finesse is easy|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: yes, good player, and decent guy too|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Several ways to guarantee 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: lol  you're right :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  Hanlon may be showing off here|pg||
nt|vbman: and some no of hearts as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I may have lost a pip there, that happened too fast, sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: south and east hands are correct anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there was one very dull set early on|pg||
nt|chick: yesterday was dull, today has been interesting hands all day |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: yes but south just overruffs and you can never keep trump control so you basically lose both the diamonds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I couldnt see any other plan from N than a @d finess:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vbman: l am surprised he has not worked out hands|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|djneill:  these kinds of sets are tough to play well|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @sJ was good to keep him on the dummy for a 2nd finesse if needed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sheila a: This misunderstanding ensures NS lose an extra undertrick|pg||
nt|sheila a: Could have been more costly on another day|pg||
nt|athene: you can never draw north's @H5, effectively|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|georgia19: yes, but, his speciality was giving %'s for every contact|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|h9|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: It sounds like Goodman did not actually discard his 4th @d|pg||
nt|djneill:  so played to drop the @sK offside, hmm|pg||

mb|1N|an|12-14|nt|cuttysark: Got disconnected there for a minute - seems Scotland collected 6 imps while I was gone...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sheila a: They stayed low on the 4@s hand|pg||

nt|athene: one thing about this 2-way club is, it comes up a LOT - like polish club|pg||
nt|athene: because balanced rubbish hands come up more than anything els|pg||
nt|athene: else|pg||
nt|toobad: i would have fancied David Greenwood to make that, but unfortunately they didnt bid it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and after a @s in trick2 declarer could either set up a @s trick or use a throw in on W with @sA and @dQxx|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 23, Wales stopped to take a piece out of 2@SX but got only 500 so lost 3 against the 3NT making in here.|pg||

nt|athene: so, if your opponents are playing a system like this, you really have to be on firm ground in the bidding, otherwise you are going to lose a lot of imps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: Not convinced by this double - looks like @DK is badly placed, and he has 2 spades|pg||

pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: North not so pleased with the dummy. @DK is a trick after all, but the spade void is a blow|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Too late for that|pg||

nt|athene: @S10 a middling card from a solid sequence, maybe suit-pref for diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: (@SQ would show a heart card; @S8 a club stop?)|pg||

pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: possibly 3@c=weak in one minor and 5@D pass/correct |pg||
pc|cA|nt|yorkbeach:  Mark Roderick|pg||
nt|paulhac:  In order to make he had to ruff spades early and play North for 2 hearts and AQ@S with no more than 3 spades in total|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mikeirl: 3NT on Board 9 misdefended by Ireland in Open|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|athene: 4@H might go wrong though - might be hard to draw trumps with no entries to east|pg||

nt|georgia19: I find that SO hard to believe: I remember the most obscure bits of our system and I am no where in the class of these two - guess tiredness may play a part|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 6@D on NS|pg||
nt|sheila a: Scotland avoided doubling 5@d for another small gain|pg||
nt|athene: still it's not exactly an easy lead decision|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sheila a: A more traditional weak 2 in the E hand|pg||
nt|sheila a: Awkward bid for S|pg||
nt|djneill:  East was afraid North had the @cA, or many cases where the third heart would not matter|pg||
nt|djneill:  acol strong NT opens 1 of a minor|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|jtr: Or @s|pg||
nt|athene: yet another 4-6 in the red suits :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: do you bid 2@D here or double?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cuttysark: Not the tiem to try 2N without a stopper|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to get the suit into it|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: that sure ruined South's pretty hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Wow Kokish overcall|pg||
nt|athene: you would expect a simple 4@S overcall from north, given partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|idc: This month's Bridge World mentioned playing East's 3@d rebid here (in a free run) as a forcing 3@c bid|pg||
nt|steveray: and another e/w game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not sure about this|pg||
nt|chick: too greedy, he can see 2 almost sure red suit losers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have done well to stay low|pg||
nt|athene: if partner can't bid 1@H over 1@S, it's not that likely we belong in hearts|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: sound 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H over 1@C, sorry|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|nt|athene: even sounder 2@S|pg||
nt|jtr: This is not possible|pg||
nt|athene: all this soundness and you might find yourself losing ten imps|pg||
nt|jtr: Sandbagging maybe?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: did West really open 1@C and then double 1@s?|pg||
nt|jtr: Wrong cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: would you pas 1@s with S hand?|pg||
nt|athene: it all seems unlikely :)|pg||
nt|toobad: best lead for def again|pg||
nt|mikeirl: a @D switch even at trick 2 is unlikely to cost and gives 2 chances |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sheila a: @s won't play as badly as all that, especially if the force in @h is avoided|pg||
nt|djneill:  North can feel the @s lead coming and 7 tricks rolling, so I would have tried 2@c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: it's a good auction but not on these hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You doubt that Marta is doing the right thing??|pg||
nt|sheila a: Short gave hard thought to making a game try; Walker gave none to declining it|pg||
nt|athene: repeated trump leads normal against this sort of contract, but they aren't hurting it|pg||
nt|steveray: not a triumph for support doubles|pg||
nt|athene: if double was support (3 spades) it does look odd to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S didn't promise five, did it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: East says i suppose i could have bid 4d|pg||
nt|idc: I wanted to show I keep up-to-date and wasn't going to let North steal my erudite comment, heh|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Shame on you!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|djneill:  maybe West's 2nd @h must be suit preference, as the first was the attitude(count)|pg||
nt|golfsquash: strange auction|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|chick: very bad hand to try and get a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can always just draw trumps and make five tricks from trumps and four from clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in what way?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzxx: and we are home :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: one trump, no certainly that partner has any entry at all|pg||
nt|toobad: oops............ undo??|pg||
nt|milton_se: oops|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Double?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: well, enterprising bidding by West, then |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marta made an error in 1991, not a single one after that|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Its nothing to do with support doubles Steve its the decision over 2@S|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: well a simple 3@D over 2@S looks normal enough|pg||
nt|athene: even without erudite agreements :)|pg||
nt|steveray: does he believe  partner has another trump?|pg||
nt|athene: he probably just decided that a) west might well have 5+ spades and b) even if he doesn't, 4@S could be the right spot|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: home in a way, but 6@D was a nicer property to live in|pg||
nt|jtr: The whole bidding has dry rot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This auction is perhaps not textbook, but it is correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I've just noticed that cards A@s is swaped with k@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West would surely pass 1@S with his hand, opposite a partner who has passed |pg||
nt|ady: the auction seems odd  1@S overcall?   then re-opening with the west hand   and the opening1@C?   can anyone explain|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it is differs with bbo layout, but other cards are fine|pg||
nt|mdgraham: er, no|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think we have a Mystery|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they don't have the cards we see on our screens|pg||
nt|jtr: I think the hands got scambled in cyberspace|pg||
nt|jtr: No maybe about it Roland|pg||
nt|jtr: But surely Marta can see?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could it be board 27 or 28, Marta?|pg||

pc|s8|nt|cuttysark: Looks like a signal for clubs - perhaps Matheson hopes to persuade South to ruff high, not realising that he will not ruff at all|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 11 Ireland sailed into 4@h by the rare ploy of opening a 4 card major on the W hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  didnt West have 4 hearts?|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this could be expensive if EW can engineer a spade ruff or two - ah, North has bid 3@S|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ybob: at least|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3H was a little foolhardy at these colours partner has shown weak hand and qx of @d always seems to be wortholess in these situations|pg||
nt|rmb1: No sure why North tried to play in 3@H - except it had not been doubled|pg||
nt|lestergold: north had fingers in his ears wiating for the consequences of his somewhat questiomnabole bid over the1N overcall|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think 2@S is ok with four-card support|pg||
nt|lestergold: need to be a little more conservative at these colours in contesting part scores the 1n opvercall is a warning that spades are not breaking well|pg||

nt|mdgraham: let us agree to differ. With four-card support, passing is just as dangerous. You might lose 90/120 when you are on for 110|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: 1 minute break  for kibitzers in the Club, a bit crowdy here|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  relief to E-W as the 5@d debacle was muted by 5@c down in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT seems to have little chance on a diamond lead   but was made in CR|pg||
nt|idc: this is tough to call - you need to find the @cQ to make game so could be a swing either way after Scotland stopped in partscore|pg||
nt|djneill:  5@d south made other room whoah!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxx: not the best set for Joneses|pg||
nt|chick: nope|pg||
nt|warrens:  a light opening worked here as it induced W to overcall and keep N/S out of @S's|pg||
nt|djneill:  Wales is en fuego|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with good guesswork EW can make 5@d|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mikeirl: They're in 4@S|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yorkbeach:  West could not really have had any less for 3NT but I knew Peter would go for the @cQ|pg||
nt|justin c: the good news is that 9 tricks are available here|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can get a spade ruff now, for one down|pg||
nt|athene: (@HAQ, @CA, @CAK and the ruff)|pg||
nt|sheila a: unlucky to wrong side it|pg||
nt|mikeirl: this lead should defeat it by one|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings before the last round|pg||

pc|hA|nt|athene: yes, and another 5 here they aren't going to score|pg||

nt|athene: 4 imps sorry - they were NV so only 50|pg||
nt|athene: i would open west a 20-21 or 20-22 2nt|pg||
nt|toobad: lost the tempo|pg||
nt|toobad: he was home|pg||
nt|golfsquash: needed to exit in trumps|pg||
nt|djneill:  other room, West cashed one club, sniffed, switched and South eliminated the black suits and trumps to lead a heart towards the board and East was endplayed|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes then go for down 3|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sheila a: Which made sure of not missing game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well that gets the job done!|pg||
nt|idc: to be fair to me, I was looking at the screen through a red mist ... sigh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E should have won on dumme and used his last @s for a thorw in on N|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: director back, 3 minutes now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lots of aces and a 5-card suit - not even minimum for 2nt in my opinion|pg||
nt|toobad: undo|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: A very excellent job by our vugraph operator Marcin!! |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: thx|pg||
nt|djneill:  1@h 4+ crds I think?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@S  on a finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: err...|pg||
nt|ady: assuming no heart ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: replay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: last hand and thx to all |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: action replay, no less|pg||
nt|djneill:  East hides the 4crd heart suit since the long spades are sure tricks at NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  there we go|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we are bakc in about 40 min |pg||
nt|warrens:  East needs to overtake and switch to a club if declarer ducks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a quiet dea for a change|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: North cant move|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if he does he will find out that they are off 2 keycards|pg||
nt|sheila a: Sime's opening ran the risk of keeping NS out of a non-making game|pg||
nt|mikeirl: imps for Scotland on Board 28 - E/W are in 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: you might even consider rising the @HK here, to start clubs from the right side|pg||
nt|athene: on the grounds that the spades are more of a worry than the hearts anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: thanks v much all..... laters!!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: True|pg||
nt|justin c: double at other table, looking for @S lead|pg||
nt|sheila a: It looks like an opening bid to me, to be fair|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: as soon as the tray came through, Goodman was passing... McGann thought otherwise..|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 1@h can be only 4 but not when West rebids 2@d|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: sry, lost connection|pg||
nt|georgia19: we seem to have got to the last board skipping a lot - now what contract gives 29 imps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it went down here for a while, scots in 4h + 2, maybe 6 on|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: then they let out a 1nt|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I agree - these 5-5s just have to be opened|pg||
nt|golfsquash: need some good guessing in the redsuits|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s coming back here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  shortage of entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|warrens:  he can make this, but not simple|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sheila a: Feisty double from Matheson|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, they got every chance to stay out of it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Singleton in partner's suit and a trump trick - good combination|pg||
nt|sheila a: But Sime is thinking .....|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He pulled a double yesterday to a game he just might have made - hopefully he has learned something|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 5@D is trouble!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sheila a: Phew!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to trust partner in these situations - gives you the shouting rights|pg||
nt|sheila a: That's the danger of doubling for one off - you give your partner another chance to bid :)|pg||
nt|idc: Two specs have asked the sensible question about the defensive carding last hand|pg||
nt|toobad: i suspect the hovering Director didnt help his play|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: I think Matheson is hoping for at least 2 down|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: normal to lead to a big one first with that suit, if you have enough entries to dummy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|milton_se: no way to nine tricks unless South lets go of a spade -- or they set up a H|pg||
nt|athene: gain against Ax onside or stiff jack offside|pg||
nt|athene: ok that was last i think? thanks all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good time to finish, this - almost Beer Time where I live |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mikeirl: leads to 15/15|pg||
nt|idc: All the scores in except this Bd - so well done to England on their win|pg||
nt|golfsquash: maybe best to get the diamonds going|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: While this hand is taking its twelve winners, a genreal point: |pg||
nt|chick: heart will work though|pg||
nt|warrens:  West can pitch two clubs now.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jtr: Slight risk in taking the trump finesse|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only half way, Michael, lots more excitement to come :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 13 Walker managed to make 2@s, despite the 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes - solid bridge played here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|milton_se: 10D is killing|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sheila a: Double part score swing|pg||
nt|djneill:  it's hard for either defender to get @h he would not otherwise get|pg||
pc|s7|nt|milton_se: no! not any more...|pg||
nt|chick: I think he can still do it|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: I note that Short did not open the North hand :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some of us play K for count and Ace fot attitude|pg||
nt|idc: so I should reply that I would encourage as North (high in their system)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|djneill:  this would be funny if it was East that was squeezed, not West|pg||
nt|warrens:  can't make it anymore.  but West will need to exit with the @C Q if declarer plays Ace and a @S now|pg||
nt|djneill:  how could he have made it warren|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sheila a: Does that earn him a brownie point from you?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Half a mark|pg||
nt|mikeirl: will Garvey lead a low @C now?|pg||
nt|djneill:  raven defense|pg||
nt|golfsquash: getting messy now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: S is squeezed in spades and hearts|pg||
nt|idc: but that I can't imagine not playing @hK at trick 2 as SOuth were I to decide to continue the suit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: Better had, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: that's it everyone,|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: back shortly|pg||
nt|chick: Great job, Peter :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: closing shortly, join us again in 20 minutes for the final set of the first weekend|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: this was the last bd of the set, next set schedule after about 15 min break|pg||
nt|peachy: opearator, is that still the plan?|pg||
nt|sheila a: This match is very tight. Garvey and Carroll have played steadily|pg||
nt|mikeirl: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And thanks to Ronan for great operating under difficult circumstances!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|milton_se: 3 clubs mashes South|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|georgia19: very gracious, Ian, nice to have your company but I think the English had the rub of the green|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thanks everyone|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|djneill:  well done|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he can make it by cashing 2 rounds of @D's, then play Ace and a @S while he still had 4 @S's in dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx  all will cu soon  just over 1/2 hour |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: that's all for now, thanks all|pg||
nt|djneill:  think West can still play @cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: back in 30 minutes from now|pg||
nt|warrens:  then West again would have to exit with the club Q, setting up a potential squeeze of East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: 2:55 local time|pg||
nt|warrens:  but the squeeze doesn't work, so always down|pg||
nt|djneill:  ah even before the @d do that, so West can't get a count on anything|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, interesting, leave him his @D's and he has to guess to play the @c Q before he knows|pg||
nt|djneill:  yeah just play for him to have @sKQ and that's it|pg||
nt|warrens:  of course, against a 3rd seat vul 3-level opening, that might be a quick way to go down 4|pg||
nt|djneill:  right|pg||
nt|warrens:  Is West still thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: all done, he made it, W continued spades|pg||
nt|warrens:  did he exit with a small @C at the end?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: didn't catch final @c exit but he had cashed both spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: ok closing now, thanks all|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: noooooooo|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|chick: W blew it|pg||
