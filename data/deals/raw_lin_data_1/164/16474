nt|Walddk2: 2@S by Forrester would probably be constructive, hence 1NT first|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: totally frozen out looks like e/w will grt a decent score|pg||
nt|ady: this should be a good result for n/s   e/w unable to enter  can likely make 3 hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 34 tables in play, so waiting will be part of the game|pg||
nt|jillan:  I think the right play is to win the @S trump a @S play a trump to the table and trump another another @S then draw trumps a bit and play a @D to the table if the @S Q is good , Fine otherwise the @C A may be right|pg||

nt|pitiful:  south passing a real shot imo|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But not at all tables I am sure|pg||

nt|ady: will be an excellent round for e/w   over 80 percent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next round: N-S £1,700   ....  E-W  £100    so it could be Zia-Bakhshi N-S as they went for 1,700|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes south throwing in a 12 count is not a recipe for winning at imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: or even mps!|pg||
nt|ady: cant see how 10 tricks was made hand 3 unless the play was different to shown|pg||
