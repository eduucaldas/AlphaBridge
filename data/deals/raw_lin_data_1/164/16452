nt|jwit: This board rates to be a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1H|mb|d!|nt|garnetts: even playing a strong club I rate 1@D as a better shot|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|garnetts: I have seen hands like this forced to bid at the five level for the first time after a strong club |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  difference of opinion there - you will never get the hand across if you start with 1@d|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree David.  I hate starting with 1C on distributional 2 suiters.  Auction frequently gets back to you at the 4 or 5 level|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|jwit: And you have yet to show either of your suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: try 1@D and follow it with spades at the four level --that should give partner a tiny clue |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what was 1@h? no alert but why is East bidding 3@c?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Of course a strong 2@D is best of all--but a bit in the dim past |pg||
nt|jwit: Probably meant it as some sort of limit raise in hearts, though a bit confusing since 1C is artificial|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: you kinow there is a good case after 3@C to play 4@D as leaping michaels --leaving 3@H as a no trump grope  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  an interesting idea|pg||
nt|jwit: I don't like Denning's 3H bid.  Needed to start showing suits at that point.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tis a while since I played a strong club system regularly|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do know one thing a 1@D opening  would have sorted this nonsense out |pg||
nt|jwit: Couldn't agree more|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: 3@H looks very confusing to me --when in doubt bid their suit and let partner mess it up  |pg||
nt|jwit: Denning has put his partner in a very awkward position now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: However, he was up to the task|pg||
nt|garnetts: he did well |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes I prefer to bid one of my suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: I admit I would have bid 4@H as North |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes and pass the buck!|pg||
nt|jwit: 3D over 3C would make it much easier to bid spaes yourself at your next opportunity|pg||
nt|jwit: spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: However, they landed in the right spot, without being double dummy and getting to a slam|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Jon's prediction looks like it will come true now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: perhaps E should have bounced in hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: it stared as boring flat board and finished up showing why I do not like playing strong club systems |pg||
nt|jwit: Tempting with 5 trumps, but without controls or distribution, not unreasonable to sell|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jwit: In fact, 5H does very poorly|pg||
nt|garnetts: I know one or two easts who would have bid 1@S after the 1@H overcall |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  since West does not have a trump higher than 8, declarer cn get to hand to finesse trumps twice|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: 3H to raise level|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: I use the 1level less than would make you physicaly ill over strong club!|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  with the @SK doubleton, there is no need to finesse twice of course|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|garnetts: Kokish has always argued when you have five of partner's suit bid game --that does give south a problem |pg||

nt|sybarra: and hello again Peter and John |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: NS  playing carrot club|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: EW playing 4 card majors weak NT|pg||
nt|toobad: 6s on ist board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: still a bit of system discussion going on, haven't taken a board out yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Earwig O|pg||
nt|toobad: We know ROI like to take their time Peter............. we're used to it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sheila a: Good morning|pg||
nt|idc: and to Mike & Georgia my fellow commentators|pg||
nt|idc: and Ronan, our Operator, who is the only one of us doing real work :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: hi Peter and all|pg||
nt|toobad: 4d would solve that|pg||

mb|1C!|an|10-13bal or 17+any|nt|mcarroll:  .|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: And good morning to you, Shiela, and everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: hello|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Ronan |pg||
nt|sybarra: or even 3 @D will assist |pg||
nt|mikeirl: not reasonable to bidit :)|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0¬Å-7|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Best to avoid 3NT here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play a home-grown strong club system known as the Delberto Club |pg||
nt|idc: The 1@h was alerted - it is natural but may conceal a longer @d suit if fewer than about 11/12 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: one of the players filing a fingernail|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I won't say who|pg||
nt|milton_se: not easy to find 4H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: good morning Bertil|pg||
mb|1S|an|could still be 10-13 3+!s|nt|chick: 1@C has several meanings, I assume here it is  16+ HCPs, unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|georgia19: 3nt of course, is cold - as usual|pg||
nt|milton_se: maybe a double would be better (if not defined as penalty)|pg||
nt|milton_se: now the Hs seem out of question|pg||
nt|chick: so at this point, N still doesn't know what kind of hand S has|pg||
mb|2D|an|17+, 4+ !s, 5+ !d|nt|chick: Hello everyone :)|pg||

nt|peachy: event webpage here: http://www.cbai.ie/|pg||
nt|peachy: Wales as the hosts field two teams|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@h looks fine|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome everyone to this 3rd round Camrose match between England & Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: North in his box|pg||
nt|idc: Nice try by Brian Short to shut out West but Derek Patterson doesn't know the meaning of "shut out"|pg||
nt|mikeirl: was worth a 4@D bid surely|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 4 @S shuts if off but clear where W wants to play it |pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Michael |pg||
nt|toobad: 4d would certainly have been more descriptive|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Shirley |pg||
nt|mikeirl: and John|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think its tougher with a 2 @D overcall |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: diamond ruff may loom|pg||
nt|idc: The names as they stand are mixed up but better to get the first hand details right - we'll correct the names when we have time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable for West to bid both his suits - he has a fair hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: it's a pity 3@c didn't promise all those clubs - S would have raised then|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: not a nice easy board to get the brains going|pg||
nt|chick: 1@D 0-7 undefined suits|pg||

nt|milton_se: hej Ralf|pg||
nt|toobad: Welcome to the OK Corral|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Cornelia|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: 2@D is game force showing the 16+ unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: Hard for East to realise that partner has an entry - but if the queen is dropped he should fins the switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: declarer can ditch second @c on a @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But then North can cross to @HA to discard a club. Oh well|pg||

nt|milton_se: welcome, John|pg||
nt|mikeirl: easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|vbman: not a direct raise to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|mikeirl: England 17/13 against Ireland|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have the EW system - weak notrump, 4-card majors is pretty popular in scotland but we will see|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: NS are playing a Carrot club (11-13 bal or 17+)|pg||
nt|idc: "no defections", heh, I like it Ronan|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose after the double you might finesse the diamonds but it's asking quite a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: This is a fun-looking hand - can N-S reach slam?   and do they want to?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S is natural, possibly 4 cards in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|2S|nt|justin c: 2@H natural is the way to play here|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeirl: silvertexter|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: indeed, both Dbl and NT are available for the other suits|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose that makes more sense where people open 1@H with 10xxx :)|pg||
nt|justin c: if W can have 4 small, you cant get shut out with a good hand with @H|pg||
nt|justin c: as you say, lots of takeout bids available|pg||
nt|chick: oh, nevermind, it wasn't the opening bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes NS play 2-way 1@C opener, 14-16 nt, upside down carding|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards leap off to the sky in my 2 cards suit when I double like that |pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: it was sime who was thinking there|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to take some hundreds|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: matehson experimenting with the 3-card rebid at a bad time - Sime also a bit pushy|pg||
nt|sheila a: I don't like the look of this contract|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
pc|d8|nt|idc: South hand may be too short of entries to make this a good one|pg||
nt|georgia19: wonder how many they'll make, apart from the (normal) @d break, everything is perfect|pg||

nt|toobad: no lol|pg||
pc|d7|nt|milton_se: very timid pass by South|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: EW are strong notrump, 5-card majors, weak-2@D@H@S, standard count, upside down attitude|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think I prefer 2@d from Sime's hand - if partner has 4 @h it's easy for him to bid them|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: John having a think now|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: forcing with support or balanced|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@c=art FG|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mikeirl: no defence to beat this|pg||
nt|sheila a: 3@c = minimum|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South worried about the diamond stopper|pg||
nt|sheila a: I presume partner could have asked about majors if he wanted, so his cards should be in minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: well judged|pg||
nt|peachy: I suspect Dbl was takeout oriented|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes well timed and really good defense to beat game double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Walker has shown 12-15 bal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: It seems you can ake 6@C by ruffing finesse against @DA to pitch 2 spades|pg||
nt|sheila a: I wouldn't want to be in it|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 5@H has good chance to make|pg||
nt|milton_se: and no double - very cheap save|pg||
nt|chick: who should double? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: doubleton @CQ in the pocket, and the @HK right|pg||
nt|idc: To look on the bright side, we'll see comparisons for those first 2 boards soon enough|pg||
nt|georgia19: as you can see, 13 tricks are available in @c's or NT, but needing both finesses for that , they'll probably settle for 6|pg||
nt|milton_se: close choice between 3@D and 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: will Hanlon try 3 nt,  yes |pg||
nt|toobad: hard not to|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 1NT forcing if opener is 13+|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I expect it was bid as sac, insurance against potential making 4S|pg||
nt|justin c: friendly layout for dec|pg||
nt|mikeirl: would be uncomfortable on a spade lead|pg||
nt|vbman: good agreement to have|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idc: for any specs new to BBO vugraph, use the 'Movie' feature to follow progress in the other table of this match|pg||
nt|georgia19: BRIGHT side Ian, are you sure?|pg||
nt|georgia19: first board must have been bad for the Scots|pg||
nt|idc: Yup, beats waiting for 2 hours if you start in the Open room - don't mind losing IMPs, it's the waiting I hate|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: might make 12 tricks - for example on a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: Jxxx isn't all that appealing but if you think neither opponent has four, it's not so bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  not sure what else you bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thanks pard, with a smile |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: declarer will be happy|pg||
nt|steveray: certainly not a testing contract to play|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Assuming 4@D is a Splinter, North cues? Or worried about his spade stopper?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to avoid being forced to open up the hearts, if they want four tricks|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what 2@C would have shown instead of 2@S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sheila a: It's an odd sequence if S really did show minimum and N signed off in 3NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: ah now it makes more sense|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if North couls sign off in 4n?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s=no singleton or void|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: Spade lead really the only one to give a problem - guess at trick one|pg||
nt|sheila a: Early gain for Ireland - Scotland played board 1 in the no hope 3NT |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a correct save as EW can make 4@h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzxx: crouch not sure what 4h is|pg||
nt|georgia19: only a spade gives nothing - or a trump I suppose|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: safe now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a tad kangaroo at the end|pg||
nt|chick: seems like an obvious 2@C or even 3@C bid to me|pg||
pc|d9|nt|milton_se: would certainly as West. knowing tehe|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Pigot for Ireland stuck in an overcall - perhaps showing both Majors? and the fit was lost|pg||
nt|idc: Well, even if Peter wasn't entirely sure about 4@h this still looks well bid|pg||
nt|georgia19: is that a new bridge expressiion, mike?|pg||
nt|idc: Combined 27 count with some wasted in @h and they still get to a good slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the Kangaroo Klub - a bit leapy and jumpy (and possible Skippy as well)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: but it could be next step if EW is in 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Carroll now querying who's granny Tommy would be playing with to XX|pg||
nt|toobad: now W suffers|pg||
nt|vbman: 10 tricks will be|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: England made 5@c on board 17|pg||
pc|c9|nt|milton_se: there's no freak distribution|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't have the comm to eliminate @D for the throw in|pg||
nt|idc: The Open room starts with Bds 15 & 16 of course, so this room is 2 bds ahead|pg||
nt|sybarra: just thinking poor Robin |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|idc: I suspect that @cA was played because it feels good when you drop a stiff K|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx:    whose|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: now 4 @S tricks will come home |pg||
pc|h5|nt|sheila a: Shows the value of interfering with the opponents' NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|justin c: anybody else think double was rather unnecessary here?|pg||
nt|peachy: Adrian asssured additional dummy entries by saving his H4, not that he needed them this time|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|idc: And with Short/Walker in the other room, the chances of them catching up with us are ...not good|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|nt|chick: W has singleton heart and one ace|pg||
nt|athene: he would never be likely to refuse the trump finesse anyway - but 140 is fair enough|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|pc|h7|nt|chick: his partner only promised 3 spades and 13 cards|pg||
nt|idc: As epika points out to me from spec, it's a bit anti-percentage|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|steveray: absolutely, they'd have bid 6 if they'd known about the breaks as well:)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chick: I think very hard to double from either E or W|pg||
nt|toobad: home now with a d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mikeirl: well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it was +1|pg||
nt|idc: If you needed 2 spade ruffs there is a lot more reason for @cA at trick one, but one is enough with @hA providing a pitch|pg||
nt|georgia19: yes, Patterson made it a bit tough for himself, but is home on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: crouch|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  tough|pg||
nt|garnetts: the hearts are also guarded --so all will be well --and to answer the question not that |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jwit: Results will be awful with that lead, but I think it was very reasonable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for some pairs 3@d might be a probe rather than a suit, so prefer a @d to a @s|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think I would have led a heart because EW are playing four card majors |pg||
nt|jwit: I wouldn't think 3D would be a probe with the jump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if the @h spots were better, a @h would have more going for it|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|garnetts: IF South ducks dec might leave the suit alone--but the club finesse works so it wont matter |pg||

nt|peachy: South will bid clubs a few times I expect|pg||
nt|milton_se: agree if 2S means "nothing", but that's not my style|pg||
nt|vbman: some ask why he dint finesse again|pg||
mb|4H|nt|justin c: or just once :)|pg||
nt|peachy: or just once, as here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: putting West on lead against 3NT might have been fun|pg||
nt|justin c: the trouble with playing in @C is that East is on lead|pg||
nt|justin c: and suspects @H better|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: No -2|pg||
nt|idc: well, I did mention that only 1 spade ruff was needed - great though the defence was I suspect that Peter will feel he ... could have done better|pg||
nt|georgia19: all down to a bad decision at trick 1 with both finesses working, he declined one|pg||
nt|vbman: he made 9 and if the the king were off he wd be down|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I think it "should" mean "nothing. With spade support and values, defending looks promising|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, I agree|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice set of nasty hands to start with (I hate 4441)|pg||
mb|d|nt|bigtrain: not sure i would in 2nd seat and i open anything thay moves :)|pg||
nt|chick: if not for the bad heart split, NS might have a game with 16 HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north might consider breaking discipline and bidding 3@D here|pg||
nt|toobad: handy 3n|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: I've got to run, thanks Bertil, Cornelia, and all kibs. Enjoy the rest!|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Raija @H@H!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This opening bid should get them to 3N, another contract I think I might make|pg||
nt|idc: Similar basic system for both pairs: strong NT, 5 card majors, weak Twos in majors|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzxx: lots of explanations now going on which I can't hear or see|pg||

pc|cA|nt|athene: you only go up with the queen there if you need two fast spade tricks - playing low has several benefits|pg||
nt|athene: one of which being west led from @SJ10 :)|pg||

nt|vbman: must be careful now|pg||
nt|vbman: to play a trump|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good play at trick 1;  this contract could make|pg||
nt|chick: W must lead A and another @H to set this|pg||
nt|vbman: yes small seems not ok|pg||
pc|s8|nt|idc: 2@d is different: natural weak for Scots, undisciplined multi for English|pg||
nt|chick: small heart and N would get 2 black tricks and 9 trumps|pg||
nt|chick: 8* trumps|pg||
nt|vbman: must carefully count now, its very easy to go wrong in such hands|pg||
nt|chick: the only danger from N's point of view is W being able to overruff a diamond too soon, but as the cards lie, W will have to overruff the Q and still come to only 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|justin c: 5@C is a good bid here, whether it makes or is a good save against 4M the other way|pg||
nt|chick: I don't know what the XX meant, but S went pretty quietly for such a suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: I'm going for a coffee ...|pg||
nt|toobad: longest and strongest|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: @c9 shows either no higher, or the T and another higher|pg||

nt|mikeirl: I've just consulted my Bridge Conventions Complete that Liz bought me a few years back - and it ain't in it!! :(|pg||
pc|cK|nt|justin c: bit unlucky that neither of those things happening|pg||
nt|justin c: 3 small @H in N is not what he wanted|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: maybe "undisciplined" is a bit unfair - weaker weak two than 2@h or 2@s perhaps better way to describe it|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 2 sugars for me please :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|athene: yes, "undisciplined" usually means wide-ranging and unilateral, rather than specifically weak|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|h5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|h4|nt|athene: if you need three tricks and no losers from this heart combination, you have various options - play west for K10 is normal but you might get enough of a count to know that's not ...|pg||
nt|athene: possible|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|georgia19: do you think if I say this will  -1 or -2 I'm in with a chance?|pg||
nt|chick: pitching the @DK might help EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: 2@h = 3 card support|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This Irish pair open very light, but they will still reach 4@S - not a gimme|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: another thing is if you bid a game with som invite bid, you often will have no save|pg||

mb|p|nt|vbman: surprise cl lead|pg||
nt|chick: N's failure to bid 2@S might suggest the @C as a better lead?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: north doesn't have a very nice 15 count but it is 15 and since he has presumably shown 12-14, he has to bid this|pg||

pc|c2|nt|justin c: Cant blame W for giving this hand a look|pg||

nt|toobad: this is what happens|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: this is safe because declarer's spades are just strong enough|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! 5 rounds of @c will give a trick to @sK!|pg||

mb|1N|an|6-11|nt|mikeirl: 3nt by S looks reasonable here|pg||

nt|sybarra: 4 card majors |pg||
nt|mikeirl: K@C lead would have made it simple|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: will take a swipe at this i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: also you have the advantage that if you take the finesse and it fails, you lose more tricks|pg||

pc|cA|nt|sheila a: play should be fairly quick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and, wonder of wonders, 1@s is natural |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|peachy: this was an auction where both sides tried to make the opponents take the last guess|pg||
nt|georgia19: what does he bid with @d's?|pg||
nt|georgia19: opener, I mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a @S switch at trick 2 on bd 19|pg||
pc|c4|nt|toobad: and on 18 N reached the dizzy heights of 3nt all on his lonesome|pg||
pc|c9|nt|justin c: the last making contract was some way back|pg||
nt|steveray: this could go off or get let in:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: sometimes hard to follow at the end of hands when they play in a blur|pg||
nt|milton_se: one finesse and a 3-3 break needed despite 26 hcp|pg||
nt|toobad: if Carroll's hand was 2533 would he really have given all that thought over 4H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: screens in use - W Hamilton could have been thinking about his 4@s, no?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: i would have thought most would open 1@H with that east hand|pg||
nt|idc: good news for declarer: they didn't cash @s|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, no harm done|pg||
nt|idc: bad news: still too many losers in pointed suits|pg||
nt|athene: tricky to play - maybe cash just two clubs to get rid of one spade, then lead spades up to take advantage of @SJ onside? trying to have the best of both worlds|pg||
nt|milton_se: and also: Carroll might have 1-5-x-x w @SJ|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|justin c: would rather put a red card on 4@S than try 5@C with N|pg||
nt|chick: I thought 5@D from N would have been better|pg||
nt|georgia19: c'mon Mike, what's the answer?|pg||
nt|idc: 1NT rebid I guess|pg||
pc|d8|nt|steveray: if Selway could see all 4 hands, he would be thinking it was a bit hopeless, but could try 2 rounds of clubs then try a @d|pg||
nt|idc: If there was a convenient entry to East hand I like that Bill, but there isn't|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: Interesting auction, but they've ended up where everyone else will |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: claim after 1st lead|pg||
nt|toobad: you're forgetting we have read all the ROI books Peter!!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|justin c: they arent making any overtricks when you have that lot, but can easily be drifing one or two off|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I am not sure what the West suit length implications are here - not sure if West has shown five diamonds  |pg||
nt|georgia19: I thought you'd gone off for a dram, Ian|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: yes, bit short of entries to hand, i agree|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: one thing you don't want to do is play any trumps|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, nothing else looks wonderful either|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: fingering AS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With this @s suit it¬¥correvt to play a @s to !8 or @s9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and he did so|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|idc: when I say 'guesss' - am reading their CC and 1NT is 11-13 and possibly singleton in partner's major|pg||
nt|idc: which implies they can have unbalanced hands for 1NT rebid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|justin c: 4NT for N, if you must bid anything|pg||
pc|d3|nt|justin c: if P on the same page, of course|pg||

nt|justin c: if not, you get to laugh about it later|pg||
nt|justin c: or not|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: declarer might duck this trick as well to rectify the count for a possible squeeze on north in clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|idc: he may be hoping for clubs 4-3, trumps 3-2 and a slow spade trick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: but not very likely since a) it would need north to have all three heart honours and b) the defence could break it up with a heart shift anyway|pg||

mb|3C|mb|d|nt|jwit: Surely 3H now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  much easier playing a strong system - 3@c could be other hands in some systems|pg||

nt|georgia19: but she's right, always drink the bad before the good ......my kind husband has already filled my glass - but I don't know with what, except it's red|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: now west has to decide among pass, 4@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has to show that singleton diamond somehow though|pg||
nt|steveray: so where would we like to play this one, 5@c, major moysian,??|pg||
nt|idc: true - can they avoid matchpoint NT-itis though?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: quite possible that south will just suggest notrumps at some point and north will go along with it|pg||

nt|georgia19: apparently it's Bandol, is it my birthday?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: E might have slam aspirations, but he doesn't have a bid to show it|pg||

nt|steveray: not even Matheson could manage those @d's|pg||
nt|athene: reverse splinter|pg||
nt|athene: saying i have nothing wasted in diamonds, facing the shortage|pg||
nt|toobad: 4 H EW hopefully|pg||
nt|vbman: the great dealer is capricious this set|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: 7 controls, 5-card good major and 5-4 sort of speaks in favor of trump contract, but opposite that dummy, 3NT is best|pg||
nt|peachy: 8 controls, sorry|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, wrong again, I have to admit, I'd at least bid game|pg||
nt|milton_se: so he passed :) -- don't understand that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The Irish tend to open 1@C on most hands with their 2-way methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: i dont know their bidding methods here|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live In Running Scores at all tables got to http://bridge.silvertexter.eu then "browse results" then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: the logic would go something like:- you can't bid it on 5-4 because that is not enough shape to go past 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: i don't fancy either major-suit moysian, with the wrong hand getting forced|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S should be 4h suit forcing |pg||
mb|4C|nt|mikeirl: another flat board|pg||
nt|athene: but you can't be 5-5 because you didn't michaels / whatever|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think this will quite fetch|pg||
nt|georgia19: here I go again, i predict this will not make|pg||
mb|d|nt|justin c: probably 3@S was a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: either to play there or the start of some minor suit slam try|pg||
nt|athene: and east seems to be playing it for 6-4 rather than 5-5|pg||
nt|steveray: Hi Paul, belated Happy New Year|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|athene: south has a huge hand for a passed hand, facing short diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: at least it is interesting hands, yesterday was a little dull :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: Perhaps EW should just shut their eyes and bid something over it|pg||
nt|athene: lucky clubs aren't 5-2 otherwise three rounds of clubs would promote a trump for one down|pg||
nt|idc: Other room has caught us up - I'm happy now since I get the minus scores immediately with no wait whatsoever.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he can't possibly be any better|pg||
nt|steveray: as long as it's spades.......|pg||

nt|mikeirl: nice sequence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|justin c: not sure why he didnt prefer stayman tho|pg||
nt|justin c: even with that weak @S suit, 4@S could easily be better|pg||
nt|chick: yeah, interesting ... I'm guessing that 3@C was a generic forcing takeout, S bid NT with a stopper and then 4@C says bid a suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|steveray: sensible spot|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sensible contract|pg||
nt|idc: Be interesting to know if 2@c denies a major even as an unpassed hand|pg||
nt|athene: what was barry crane's rule about 2-way finesses? the queen lies over the jack in the majors?|pg||
nt|athene: or was it the other way round?|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|idc: If so, there's a lot to be said for forgetting about 4-3 fits where the lonmg hand gets forced, so 3@h & 3@s here may not be natural |pg||
nt|paulhac:  As he may have to ruff diamonds the percentage line is to play East for the Q unless he can get a count|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|steveray: not the obvious @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: you can't draw trumps and throw a heart on a spade and ruff hearts in dummy, so you have to try reversing dummy i guess|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: they may be surprised they won on the board|pg||
mb|1D|nt|peachy: I got confirmation from kib that 3S indeed was the only way to stop in 3NT, it asked opener to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: and now you are in a bit of trouble because someone might ruff in with the @CQ on a spade and cash the @HK|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3nt with only 4 @c tricks to the defence|pg||

nt|golfsquash: board 5?|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: can they avoid 6D now?|pg||
nt|idc: South could splinter (4@c) but has more playing strength than usual for that|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: so maybe it was a bit trickier than it appeared|pg||
nt|idc: plus a good diamond suit, so I doubt he will splinter|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Lucky the club finesse works - a diamond switch now will ake him sweat|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or a spade and another heart|pg||

mb|3N|nt|athene: i don't know how EW play the double here|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland went an extra one off on Bd 6, so lead down to 4 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Garvey has to open 1@d on this type of hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But does he really have to rebid 1NT?|pg||
nt|sheila a: It appears to be the method|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Oh, yes, I see that he does :)|pg||
nt|athene: a lot depends whether you have a weak-2@D available|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H=major relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: now 2N would be 4@s invite|pg||
nt|djneill:  that 1NT could slap a 17-count around|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Should get a killing spade lead agsint 4@H|pg||
nt|sheila a: As NS haven't promised any suits, probably best to play it as a balanced hand|pg||

pc|dA|nt|athene: yes, perhaps|pg||

nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: but it's a bit tricky to know what to bid|pg||
nt|djneill:  North got over that guilt trip the easy way|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: 2@C must be some kind of checkback and 2@H denies 3 spades (my guess)|pg||
nt|sheila a: But what would E lead against 3NT?|pg||

pc|dK|nt|mikeirl: what 5 cud they take Liz?|pg||

nt|georgia19: Steve in mourning as Stevenage have scored - twice|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi.  the hand looked easy to make at the end, but I'm not surprised he played tor West to have both|pg||
nt|sybarra: so much easier for us at the perspective|pg||
nt|toobad: exactly|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: that 4@h jump is not in my copy of the system |pg||
nt|toobad: but he gave it a good go|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: with both 3-card spades and 4-card hearts, many will bid hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: I wonder what Garvey's 3@s bid meant - just a fragment?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|justin c: (if the Q didnt drop)|pg||

nt|peachy: for declarer|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Both 4H and 5C had rasonable play but with the QC wrong.......|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a: Against 3NT defence could take 4 @s and switch to a @d - that should take it off, no?|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h5|nt|sheila a: best to ruff this and ruff a @d high|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|djneill:  North applying pressure, finds the @d 4-4 so can just play a @h rather than risk @s hook|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s2|nt|idc: While 3@c may have gone down, it wouldn't be an unreasonable line to win @s lead, cash AK @c and then pich dummy's @s on a heart|pg||

pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: yes, good player, and decent guy too|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: I may have lost a pip there, that happened too fast, sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: south and east hands are correct anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: yes but south just overruffs and you can never keep trump control so you basically lose both the diamonds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I couldnt see any other plan from N than a @d finess:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vbman: l am surprised he has not worked out hands|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @sJ was good to keep him on the dummy for a 2nd finesse if needed|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sheila a: This misunderstanding ensures NS lose an extra undertrick|pg||
nt|sheila a: Could have been more costly on another day|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||

nt|toobad: i would have fancied David Greenwood to make that, but unfortunately they didnt bid it|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: North not so pleased with the dummy. @DK is a trick after all, but the spade void is a blow|pg||

nt|cuttysark: diamonds with a Suport Dbl|pg||

mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: possibly 3@c=weak in one minor and 5@D pass/correct |pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Mark Roderick|pg||
nt|paulhac:  In order to make he had to ruff spades early and play North for 2 hearts and AQ@S with no more than 3 spades in total|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not sure it's alertable - Gaz allows East to jump about with liited values because with 16+ he starts with 2@C|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|athene: 4@H might go wrong though - might be hard to draw trumps with no entries to east|pg||

mb|2D!|an|weak with both majors|nt|golfsquash: Would you propose a different line of play?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hope that shows both majors |pg||
nt|jwit: Rather aggressive to get to 3S in closed room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS will not do that here!|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looks like West will bid 4@H |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: North to lead --A@H maybe?  |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  @c lead beats it for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump lead from Liggins (South) beat 3@H by one trick in England-Wales.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @hA seems likely now|pg||
nt|garnetts: it does but why would you lead that ?  |pg||
nt|brolucius: England-NI, I mean.|pg||

nt|garnetts: This is the last board I think--I have enjoyed watching and listening to every one --thanks all |pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but with 5 trumps, can't see bidding anything less.  Partner is allowed to have 5 trumps as well, aren't they?|pg||

nt|jwit: Thanks everyone|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 6@D on NS|pg||
nt|sheila a: Scotland avoided doubling 5@d for another small gain|pg||
nt|athene: still it's not exactly an easy lead decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: A more traditional weak 2 in the E hand|pg||
nt|sheila a: Awkward bid for S|pg||
nt|djneill:  East was afraid North had the @cA, or many cases where the third heart would not matter|pg||
mb|1S|an|5+!s, 10-16|mb|p|nt|jtr: Or @s|pg||
nt|athene: yet another 4-6 in the red suits :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: do you bid 2@D here or double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not the tiem to try 2N without a stopper|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to get the suit into it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: that sure ruined South's pretty hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Wow Kokish overcall|pg||
nt|athene: you would expect a simple 4@S overcall from north, given partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|idc: This month's Bridge World mentioned playing East's 3@d rebid here (in a free run) as a forcing 3@c bid|pg||
nt|steveray: and another e/w game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not sure about this|pg||
nt|chick: too greedy, he can see 2 almost sure red suit losers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have done well to stay low|pg||
nt|athene: if partner can't bid 1@H over 1@S, it's not that likely we belong in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sound 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H over 1@C, sorry|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|athene: even sounder 2@S|pg||
nt|jtr: This is not possible|pg||
nt|athene: all this soundness and you might find yourself losing ten imps|pg||
nt|jtr: Sandbagging maybe?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: did West really open 1@C and then double 1@s?|pg||
nt|jtr: Wrong cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: would you pas 1@s with S hand?|pg||
nt|athene: it all seems unlikely :)|pg||
nt|toobad: best lead for def again|pg||
nt|mikeirl: a @D switch even at trick 2 is unlikely to cost and gives 2 chances |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sheila a: @s won't play as badly as all that, especially if the force in @h is avoided|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: it's a good auction but not on these hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You doubt that Marta is doing the right thing??|pg||
nt|sheila a: Short gave hard thought to making a game try; Walker gave none to declining it|pg||
nt|athene: repeated trump leads normal against this sort of contract, but they aren't hurting it|pg||
nt|steveray: not a triumph for support doubles|pg||
nt|athene: if double was support (3 spades) it does look odd to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S didn't promise five, did it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: East says i suppose i could have bid 4d|pg||
nt|idc: I wanted to show I keep up-to-date and wasn't going to let North steal my erudite comment, heh|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Shame on you!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|djneill:  maybe West's 2nd @h must be suit preference, as the first was the attitude(count)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: very bad hand to try and get a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can always just draw trumps and make five tricks from trumps and four from clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: and we are home :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: one trump, no certainly that partner has any entry at all|pg||
nt|toobad: oops............ undo??|pg||
nt|milton_se: oops|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: well, enterprising bidding by West, then |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marta made an error in 1991, not a single one after that|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Its nothing to do with support doubles Steve its the decision over 2@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: well a simple 3@D over 2@S looks normal enough|pg||
nt|athene: even without erudite agreements :)|pg||
nt|steveray: does he believe  partner has another trump?|pg||
nt|athene: he probably just decided that a) west might well have 5+ spades and b) even if he doesn't, 4@S could be the right spot|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: home in a way, but 6@D was a nicer property to live in|pg||
nt|jtr: The whole bidding has dry rot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This auction is perhaps not textbook, but it is correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I've just noticed that cards A@s is swaped with k@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West would surely pass 1@S with his hand, opposite a partner who has passed |pg||
nt|ady: the auction seems odd  1@S overcall?   then re-opening with the west hand   and the opening1@C?   can anyone explain|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it is differs with bbo layout, but other cards are fine|pg||
nt|mdgraham: er, no|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think we have a Mystery|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they don't have the cards we see on our screens|pg||
nt|jtr: I think the hands got scambled in cyberspace|pg||

nt|jtr: But surely Marta can see?|pg||

pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: Looks like a signal for clubs - perhaps Matheson hopes to persuade South to ruff high, not realising that he will not ruff at all|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 11 Ireland sailed into 4@h by the rare ploy of opening a 4 card major on the W hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT seems to have little chance on a diamond lead   but was made in CR|pg||
nt|idc: this is tough to call - you need to find the @cQ to make game so could be a swing either way after Scotland stopped in partscore|pg||

pc|dK|nt|vugraphzxx: not the best set for Joneses|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I agree - these 5-5s just have to be opened|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  he can make this, but not simple|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sheila a: Feisty double from Matheson|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, they got every chance to stay out of it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Singleton in partner's suit and a trump trick - good combination|pg||
nt|sheila a: But Sime is thinking .....|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He pulled a double yesterday to a game he just might have made - hopefully he has learned something|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 5@D is trouble!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|sheila a: Phew!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to trust partner in these situations - gives you the shouting rights|pg||
nt|sheila a: That's the danger of doubling for one off - you give your partner another chance to bid :)|pg||
nt|idc: Two specs have asked the sensible question about the defensive carding last hand|pg||
nt|toobad: i suspect the hovering Director didnt help his play|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think Matheson is hoping for at least 2 down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: normal to lead to a big one first with that suit, if you have enough entries to dummy|pg||
pc|h8|nt|milton_se: no way to nine tricks unless South lets go of a spade -- or they set up a H|pg||
nt|athene: gain against Ax onside or stiff jack offside|pg||
nt|athene: ok that was last i think? thanks all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good time to finish, this - almost Beer Time where I live |pg||
pc|sK|nt|mikeirl: leads to 15/15|pg||
nt|idc: All the scores in except this Bd - so well done to England on their win|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: While this hand is taking its twelve winners, a genreal point: |pg||
nt|chick: heart will work though|pg||
nt|warrens:  West can pitch two clubs now.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jtr: Slight risk in taking the trump finesse|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only half way, Michael, lots more excitement to come :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 13 Walker managed to make 2@s, despite the 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes - solid bridge played here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|milton_se: 10D is killing|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|sheila a: Double part score swing|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|milton_se: no! not any more...|pg||
nt|chick: I think he can still do it|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: I note that Short did not open the North hand :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some of us play K for count and Ace fot attitude|pg||
nt|idc: so I should reply that I would encourage as North (high in their system)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|djneill:  this would be funny if it was East that was squeezed, not West|pg||
nt|warrens:  can't make it anymore.  but West will need to exit with the @C Q if declarer plays Ace and a @S now|pg||
nt|djneill:  how could he have made it warren|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sheila a: Does that earn him a brownie point from you?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: Half a mark|pg||
nt|mikeirl: will Garvey lead a low @C now?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|chick: S is squeezed in spades and hearts|pg||
nt|idc: but that I can't imagine not playing @hK at trick 2 as SOuth were I to decide to continue the suit|pg||
pc|d8|mc|10|nt|cuttysark: Better had, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: that's it everyone,|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: back shortly|pg||
nt|chick: Great job, Peter :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: closing shortly, join us again in 20 minutes for the final set of the first weekend|pg||
