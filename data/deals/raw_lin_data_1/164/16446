nt|peachy: running scores here, from all tables http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: here we go|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: players here now, discussing systems|pg||
nt|toobad: welcome back all.......... Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello again Peter and John |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: NS  playing carrot club|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: EW playing 4 card majors weak NT|pg||
nt|toobad: 6s on ist board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: still a bit of system discussion going on, haven't taken a board out yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Earwig O|pg||
nt|toobad: We know ROI like to take their time Peter............. we're used to it|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they find out they have no wasted values in @D |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sheila a: Good morning|pg||
nt|idc: and to Mike & Georgia my fellow commentators|pg||
nt|idc: and Ronan, our Operator, who is the only one of us doing real work :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: hi Peter and all|pg||
nt|toobad: 4d would solve that|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mcarroll:  .|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: And good morning to you, Shiela, and everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: hello|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Ronan |pg||
nt|sybarra: or even 3 @D will assist |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Best to avoid 3NT here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play a home-grown strong club system known as the Delberto Club |pg||
nt|idc: The 1@h was alerted - it is natural but may conceal a longer @d suit if fewer than about 11/12 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: one of the players filing a fingernail|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I won't say who|pg||
nt|milton_se: not easy to find 4H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: good morning Bertil|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|georgia19: 3nt of course, is cold - as usual|pg||
nt|milton_se: maybe a double would be better (if not defined as penalty)|pg||
nt|milton_se: now the Hs seem out of question|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|chick: Hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Cornelia and kibitzers|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: play has started - they had problems with screen for Mark|pg||
nt|peachy: Justin:)|pg||
nt|peachy: event webpage here: http://www.cbai.ie/|pg||
nt|peachy: Wales as the hosts field two teams|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@h looks fine|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome everyone to this 3rd round Camrose match between England & Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: North in his box|pg||
nt|idc: Nice try by Brian Short to shut out West but Derek Patterson doesn't know the meaning of "shut out"|pg||
nt|mikeirl: was worth a 4@D bid surely|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 4 @S shuts if off but clear where W wants to play it |pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Michael |pg||
nt|toobad: 4d would certainly have been more descriptive|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Shirley |pg||
nt|mikeirl: and John|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think its tougher with a 2 @D overcall |pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: diamond ruff may loom|pg||
nt|idc: The names as they stand are mixed up but better to get the first hand details right - we'll correct the names when we have time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable for West to bid both his suits - he has a fair hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: it's a pity 3@c didn't promise all those clubs - S would have raised then|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: not a nice easy board to get the brains going|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk7: Good morning Ralf and Bertil|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good morning everyone!|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and Peter, our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Good morning Ralf|pg||
nt|milton_se: my ordinary (junior) pard would hate this board 1 in the morning :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good morning Peter and Bertil|pg||
nt|milton_se: hej Ralf|pg||
nt|toobad: Welcome to the OK Corral|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hard for East to realise that partner has an entry - but if the queen is dropped he should fins the switch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sheila a: declarer can ditch second @c on a @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But then North can cross to @HA to discard a club. Oh well|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Top o' the mornin' all :|pg||
nt|sheila a: morning1|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Sheila :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark: matheson thinking hard, but I am afraid thought will not help|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Dublin|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|idc: Heh, I say "we" but I don't have to do any work :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mikeirl: Morning Liz :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is David Synnott|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Bill Frisby, Walter Johnson and Michael MacDonagh|pg||
nt|bigtrain: gm everyone...  seems i've been drafted :)|pg||
nt|athene: well serves you right for being up so ridiculously early in the morning|pg||
nt|athene: esp on a saturday morning :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|georgia19: Patterson/Crouch had a brilliant first half and obviously mean to continue|pg||
nt|idc: I know some players who might rebid 3NT with the North hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: so do I|pg||
nt|idc: Not that I'm saying it is right, just that it is this time|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|pc|c6|nt|sheila a: 15 more boards to play - he doesn't want to waste too much energy on this one|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i innocently truned on my computer as i laid down to sleep a bit more...  sometime i'll learn a lesson|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk4: Hello Ian and Bill|pg||

nt|diana1: a bit more excitement now though?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: i don't think anyone can make much of anything, can they?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|diana1: doesn't look like it|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|athene: south must suspect his partner has a very strong hand with spade length|pg||
nt|athene: since there was no raise from east|pg||
nt|diana1: same bidding so far as at the other table|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt influenced by the vulnerability, i think|pg||
nt|athene: if the colours were reversed there would be much more case for just passing 2@S with that north hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north should now be worried about the clubs, in 3nt|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h5|nt|diana1: a lot of work for North to do before he can get to his 9 tricks - considering he has 4 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|athene: certainly he shouldn't make|pg||
nt|diana1: he should also be worried about his points - missing them I mean:)|pg||
nt|athene: but there are ways the defence could go wrong|pg||
nt|diana1: very true|pg||
nt|diana1: the problem is that EW, at any stage can just blatter away at @cs|pg||
nt|athene: true, but if they win the @CAK and the @CJ is a winner in dummy with established hearts, they can't play a club|pg||
nt|athene: but yes, they have so many top tricks, they should be able to control events|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|diana1: so declarer has to play on @hs immediately|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|diana1: rather than @ds|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|athene: maybe, but of course it's all too slow|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|diana1: that's safe enough - now he has the bad news|pg||
nt|athene: on the first round of bidding, north may have suspected that 1@S was not completely kosher|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: but after 2@S you have to believe that west really means it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|diana1: there is always that|pg||
nt|athene: and suddenly you just don't have any playing strength with north despite lots of points|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: i think that passing 2@S with north is the equivalent of a "great laydown" in poker|pg||
nt|athene: accepting that your marvellous hand just isn't|pg||
nt|athene: just call him "hellmuth" hanlon :)|pg||
nt|diana1: :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|diana1: so looks like 1 off?|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: sorry about the confusion, no defections as yet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might as well end it all now, Ian|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can never think about 1nt as S|pg||
nt|toobad: godd morning all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good morningJohn|pg||
nt|toobad: good even|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s are playing carrot club |pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: should be a flat board alright|pg||
nt|sheila a: Who knows the final scores from last night?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Welsh BU 18, |pg||
nt|cuttysark: bridge.silverexter.eu/results might have a clue|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: A link should be posted at some point|pg||
nt|idc: that's what prospective partners all say|pg||
nt|milton_se: welcome, John|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mikeirl: England 17/13 against Ireland|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have the EW system - weak notrump, 4-card majors is pretty popular in scotland but we will see|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: NS are playing a Carrot club (11-13 bal or 17+)|pg||
nt|idc: "no defections", heh, I like it Ronan|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose after the double you might finesse the diamonds but it's asking quite a lot|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: This is a fun-looking hand - can N-S reach slam?   and do they want to?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S is natural, possibly 4 cards in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 2@H natural is the way to play here|pg||
nt|steveray: afternoon, Bill, Ian|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mikeirl: silvertexter|pg||
mb|2S|nt|peachy: indeed, both Dbl and NT are available for the other suits|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose that makes more sense where people open 1@H with 10xxx :)|pg||
nt|justin c: if W can have 4 small, you cant get shut out with a good hand with @H|pg||
nt|justin c: as you say, lots of takeout bids available|pg||
nt|chick: oh, nevermind, it wasn't the opening bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes NS play 2-way 1@C opener, 14-16 nt, upside down carding|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards leap off to the sky in my 2 cards suit when I double like that |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Hi Steve & Bill|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it was sime who was thinking there|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to take some hundreds|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: matehson experimenting with the 3-card rebid at a bad time - Sime also a bit pushy|pg||
nt|sheila a: I don't like the look of this contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: or I should say "some partners" |pg||
nt|toobad: McGann rarely leaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxx: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
nt|sheila a: thanks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Somehow it seems that the 4-3 fit attracts bad breaks more often than ot should :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|idc: South hand may be too short of entries to make this a good one|pg||
nt|georgia19: wonder how many they'll make, apart from the (normal) @d break, everything is perfect|pg||
nt|sybarra: couldnt we all feel he was dying to take another bid |pg||
nt|toobad: no lol|pg||
pc|hK|nt|milton_se: very timid pass by South|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: EW are strong notrump, 5-card majors, weak-2@D@H@S, standard count, upside down attitude|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think I prefer 2@d from Sime's hand - if partner has 4 @h it's easy for him to bid them|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks like all it needs is a 3-3 break and @CA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: John having a think now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: about playing @sQ?|pg||
nt|milton_se: tell him it's too late :)|pg||
nt|toobad: team instructions!!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h6|nt|idc: I expect that however many it is, it'll be too many for their peace of mind|pg||
nt|sybarra: he loves his hand but just no hcp's|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Hawaii trump break|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|athene: garvey decides 2@D is a nice spot to stop - of course with his partner being a passed hand there is less danger of missing game, passing a transfer|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I don't mind the double - but perhaps East should just bid 2N, or West settle for 3@H|pg||

nt|athene: you never get rich beating NV contracts a bunch, not doubled|pg||
nt|georgia19: but as predicted (or not)  too many tricks for comfort|pg||
nt|idc: South could raise 3@d to 4@d but I think passing 3@c is right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@d from S. so N can bid a 3nt if possible|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|steveray: 3nt here|pg||
nt|idc: WHich only leaves North's 4@c - partner has come in vul v not after both opps have bid, so should have a decent 2 suiter|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: 2N presumably a game-forcing enquiry|pg||
nt|mikeirl: par score battle|pg||
nt|mikeirl: *part|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anyone agree with me?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2H is enough even for law aficianados|pg||
nt|peachy: with a defensive trick|pg||
nt|justin c: i see a @C a @H and 2@D for NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: garvey: "If I was playing with someone else I might have XXed"|pg||
mb|2C!|an|game forcing|nt|sheila a: forcing with support or balanced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D=0+@d, denies 6m unless 4M, as here|pg||
nt|georgia19: so where will this one end.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c=art FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: no defence to beat this|pg||
nt|sheila a: 3@c = minimum|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South worried about the diamond stopper|pg||
nt|sheila a: I presume partner could have asked about majors if he wanted, so his cards should be in minors|pg||
mb|3C|an|natural-ish|nt|milton_se: well judged|pg||
nt|peachy: I suspect Dbl was takeout oriented|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes well timed and really good defense to beat game double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Walker has shown 12-15 bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: It seems you can ake 6@C by ruffing finesse against @DA to pitch 2 spades|pg||
nt|sheila a: I wouldn't want to be in it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: 5@H has good chance to make|pg||
nt|milton_se: and no double - very cheap save|pg||
nt|chick: who should double? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: doubleton @CQ in the pocket, and the @HK right|pg||
nt|idc: To look on the bright side, we'll see comparisons for those first 2 boards soon enough|pg||
nt|georgia19: as you can see, 13 tricks are available in @c's or NT, but needing both finesses for that , they'll probably settle for 6|pg||
nt|milton_se: close choice between 3@D and 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: will Hanlon try 3 nt,  yes |pg||
nt|toobad: hard not to|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I expect it was bid as sac, insurance against potential making 4S|pg||
nt|justin c: friendly layout for dec|pg||
nt|mikeirl: would be uncomfortable on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: for any specs new to BBO vugraph, use the 'Movie' feature to follow progress in the other table of this match|pg||
nt|georgia19: BRIGHT side Ian, are you sure?|pg||
nt|georgia19: first board must have been bad for the Scots|pg||
nt|idc: Yup, beats waiting for 2 hours if you start in the Open room - don't mind losing IMPs, it's the waiting I hate|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: might make 12 tricks - for example on a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: Jxxx isn't all that appealing but if you think neither opponent has four, it's not so bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  not sure what else you bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thanks pard, with a smile |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: declarer will be happy|pg||
nt|steveray: certainly not a testing contract to play|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: Assuming 4@D is a Splinter, North cues? Or worried about his spade stopper?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to avoid being forced to open up the hearts, if they want four tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sheila a: It's an odd sequence if S really did show minimum and N signed off in 3NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: ah now it makes more sense|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if North couls sign off in 4n?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s=no singleton or void|pg||

nt|georgia19: is that a new bridge expressiion, mike?|pg||

nt|steveray: this could go off or get let in:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: sometimes hard to follow at the end of hands when they play in a blur|pg||
nt|milton_se: one finesse and a 3-3 break needed despite 26 hcp|pg||
nt|toobad: if Carroll's hand was 2533 would he really have given all that thought over 4H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: screens in use - W Hamilton could have been thinking about his 4@s, no?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: i would have thought most would open 1@H with that east hand|pg||

nt|athene: but anyway, no harm done|pg||
nt|idc: bad news: still too many losers in pointed suits|pg||
nt|athene: tricky to play - maybe cash just two clubs to get rid of one spade, then lead spades up to take advantage of @SJ onside? trying to have the best of both worlds|pg||
nt|milton_se: and also: Carroll might have 1-5-x-x w @SJ|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|steveray: if Selway could see all 4 hands, he would be thinking it was a bit hopeless, but could try 2 rounds of clubs then try a @d|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|athene: declarer might duck this trick as well to rectify the count for a possible squeeze on north in clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|idc: he may be hoping for clubs 4-3, trumps 3-2 and a slow spade trick|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: but not very likely since a) it would need north to have all three heart honours and b) the defence could break it up with a heart shift anyway|pg||

nt|sheila a: and now a dull 4@s|pg||
nt|georgia19: OK, now where's a more exciting hand?|pg||
nt|idc: no such luck Georgia - wife is cooking with cheapest red wine, and it is my job to finish the remaining 3/4 bottle before I can drink anything better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but should have playes @h9 first and S is squeezed with a 4-card @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry that is scores|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an|4+|nt|justin c: imagine this will end up in 3NT by W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: such hardships you have|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: subtle sort of bid now from east, like 3nt :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: 5@C not the worst contract in the world here|pg||
nt|georgia19: but she's right, always drink the bad before the good ......my kind husband has already filled my glass - but I don't know with what, except it's red|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now west has to decide among pass, 4@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has to show that singleton diamond somehow though|pg||
nt|steveray: so where would we like to play this one, 5@c, major moysian,??|pg||
nt|idc: true - can they avoid matchpoint NT-itis though?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: quite possible that south will just suggest notrumps at some point and north will go along with it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that will do, usually|pg||
nt|georgia19: apparently it's Bandol, is it my birthday?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: E might have slam aspirations, but he doesn't have a bid to show it|pg||
nt|athene: there is a case for saying this should be specifically 6-4|pg||
nt|athene: ok, that will do the trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Paul Hackett|pg||
mb|2S!|an|Have you 6!h?, Game force|nt|athene: now south is only playing in 5, 6 or 7 @C|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: i would bid 4@D with south now|pg||
nt|steveray: not even Matheson could manage those @d's|pg||
nt|athene: reverse splinter|pg||
nt|athene: saying i have nothing wasted in diamonds, facing the shortage|pg||
nt|toobad: 4 H EW hopefully|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: 7 controls, 5-card good major and 5-4 sort of speaks in favor of trump contract, but opposite that dummy, 3NT is best|pg||
nt|peachy: 8 controls, sorry|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, wrong again, I have to admit, I'd at least bid game|pg||
nt|milton_se: so he passed :) -- don't understand that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The Irish tend to open 1@C on most hands with their 2-way methods|pg||
mb|3C|nt|justin c: i dont know their bidding methods here|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live In Running Scores at all tables got to http://bridge.silvertexter.eu then "browse results" then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: the logic would go something like:- you can't bid it on 5-4 because that is not enough shape to go past 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: i don't fancy either major-suit moysian, with the wrong hand getting forced|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S should be 4h suit forcing |pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: another flat board|pg||
nt|athene: but you can't be 5-5 because you didn't michaels / whatever|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think this will quite fetch|pg||
nt|georgia19: here I go again, i predict this will not make|pg||
mb|3H|nt|justin c: probably 3@S was a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: either to play there or the start of some minor suit slam try|pg||
nt|athene: and east seems to be playing it for 6-4 rather than 5-5|pg||
nt|steveray: Hi Paul, belated Happy New Year|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|athene: south has a huge hand for a passed hand, facing short diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Perhaps EW should just shut their eyes and bid something over it|pg||
nt|athene: lucky clubs aren't 5-2 otherwise three rounds of clubs would promote a trump for one down|pg||
nt|idc: Other room has caught us up - I'm happy now since I get the minus scores immediately with no wait whatsoever.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: he can't possibly be any better|pg||
nt|steveray: as long as it's spades.......|pg||
nt|toobad: 5c is one off|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzxx: patterson is playing waiter to the whole table|pg||
nt|georgia19: now what? small spade?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: off fetching teas and coffees|pg||
nt|idc: My guess is that Scottish npc said to make the English pay, and his team has misinterpreted it|pg||
nt|georgia19: he's a nice guy, actually, a rareity among the top players ( or is it rarity?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Carroll considering|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2 with best defence|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: I would assume so too, in which case 3NT response likely conventional|pg||
nt|georgia19: careful, Ian, that was funny|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: not sure why he didnt prefer stayman tho|pg||
nt|justin c: even with that weak @S suit, 4@S could easily be better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|steveray: sensible spot|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sensible contract|pg||
nt|idc: Be interesting to know if 2@c denies a major even as an unpassed hand|pg||
nt|athene: what was barry crane's rule about 2-way finesses? the queen lies over the jack in the majors?|pg||
nt|athene: or was it the other way round?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: I think 4@H would have been better than 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: X of 4 @C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: 4@cXX would have been interesting|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sheila a: Hard to blame anyone for passing on that W hand!|pg||

nt|toobad: been|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|idc: If so, there's a lot to be said for forgetting about 4-3 fits where the lonmg hand gets forced, so 3@h & 3@s here may not be natural |pg||
nt|paulhac:  As he may have to ruff diamonds the percentage line is to play East for the Q unless he can get a count|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|steveray: not the obvious @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: you can't draw trumps and throw a heart on a spade and ruff hearts in dummy, so you have to try reversing dummy i guess|pg||
nt|athene: well you have a bit more elbow-room not being in six, of course :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: the players discussing the possibility of 4@cXX|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I got confirmation from kib that 3S indeed was the only way to stop in 3NT, it asked opener to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: and now you are in a bit of trouble because someone might ruff in with the @CQ on a spade and cash the @HK|pg||
nt|idc: Good - a slam hand|pg||
nt|idc: so far those are the only kind that Scotland gains on|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: v good bidding method|pg||
nt|justin c: gives you more sequences over 2NT|pg||
nt|toobad: Scotland and Wales are drawing 38 apiece after 20 boards |pg||
mb|3C|nt|cuttysark: Is this ttoo good for a 2@C opener?|pg||
nt|georgia19: one is supposed to blether when the hands are boring, Ian, that's what we're here for in part|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt with only 4 @c tricks to the defence|pg||
nt|toobad: England are 27-14 up against WBU after 18 boards|pg||
mb|3N|nt|milton_se: can they avoid 6D now?|pg||
nt|idc: South could splinter (4@c) but has more playing strength than usual for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so maybe it was a bit trickier than it appeared|pg||
nt|idc: plus a good diamond suit, so I doubt he will splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Interesting 3@s - maybe 3@d would be NF|pg||
nt|georgia19: I don't agree: splinters only in oppo suit - prefer 4@d, fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Blackwood in a minute, one suspects|pg||
nt|georgia19: although that would not excite North |pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|idc: I'd love if Crouch bid 4@c but ... |pg||
pc|c5|nt|sheila a: It's almost too good for a 14-16 NT - this hand should play well|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lucky the club finesse works - a diamond switch now will ake him sweat|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or a spade and another heart|pg||
nt|sheila a: declarer's problem is entries to dummy but in practice the defence can't keep him out of there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or 4@h on 4-3!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|milton_se: good brakes|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|toobad: this has chances if Burns doesnt duck the Ad when Kd played|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he is getting totally killed here|pg||
nt|athene: best is a club lead now to get a heart back through the jack|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence have two trump tricks, two aces, two hearts for three down|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: any other defence and declarer can get a heart away on a diamond|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|c9|nt|milton_se: 6D is makeable though, unless S or H lead :)|pg||

pc|h4|nt|chick: you would lead heart, I'm sure :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now wants to finesse both black suits but with no entries it's difficult|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you take a club finesse, hoping for the @SQ to fall and @CQx or @CAQ tight onside?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Even without the bad splits, 4@s is a ropy contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: (declarer entertains mad dreams of making the contract of course - little does he know!)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|athene: can just build a club now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Only 1 table for the second half so commentators scheduled for the scosed room will have to sit out. Sorry about that|pg||
nt|athene: just finding a second NV undertrick isn't so much imps-wise, but it really has an effect on opponents' morale |pg||

nt|justin c: if 1@h, not strong enough to reverse into @S|pg||
nt|sheila a: Quite a strong hand for a Multi |pg||
nt|athene: partnership harmony here|pg||

nt|mdgraham: sorry all, I can't readily see what 3@c was over the double (whatever that was)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jtr: 1@h maybe|pg||

nt|georgia19: shudda played Lebenshol:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: The Irish defender on board 9 tried @c, hoping that declarer didn't really have them|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: if 1@S, may get an unwanted preference to @S later from a p with equal M suit lengths|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Mike Best always does the opposite to what I would do, so I knew 1@S was coming|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That is one horrible Multi - wrong suit quality and 2 first round controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  3@C is some sort of Bergen raise|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Now it will be a tough defense to beat 3NT. North has to find a spade switch and South has to duck|pg||
nt|idc: @s lead ducked all round will kill this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree with Bertil (he has left) that 4441 is a bad distribution. But I always open with highest minor|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no breaking this contract |pg||
nt|justin c: overboard here|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NS undercompeting a bit here|pg||
nt|georgia19: back to sanity|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Still possible|pg||
nt|djneill:  will East find the switch in time?  may not think North has 7 spades and just 2 clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: We have created a B broadcast, which means that the operator is able to enter results from the other room when she gets them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or the only minor:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|chick: it's not exactly a LoTT Bergen raise|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: however playing inverted count the rule is to play the 10 first, after the smallest call @C, the 9 call @D|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 6@D on NS|pg||
nt|sheila a: Scotland avoided doubling 5@d for another small gain|pg||
nt|athene: still it's not exactly an easy lead decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: A more traditional weak 2 in the E hand|pg||
nt|sheila a: Awkward bid for S|pg||
nt|djneill:  East was afraid North had the @cA, or many cases where the third heart would not matter|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|mb|p|nt|jtr: Or @s|pg||
nt|athene: yet another 4-6 in the red suits :)|pg||
mb|2C|an|non promising stayman|nt|athene: do you bid 2@D here or double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not the tiem to try 2N without a stopper|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to get the suit into it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: that sure ruined South's pretty hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Wow Kokish overcall|pg||
nt|athene: you would expect a simple 4@S overcall from north, given partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|idc: This month's Bridge World mentioned playing East's 3@d rebid here (in a free run) as a forcing 3@c bid|pg||
nt|steveray: and another e/w game|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: not sure about this|pg||
nt|chick: too greedy, he can see 2 almost sure red suit losers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have done well to stay low|pg||
nt|athene: if partner can't bid 1@H over 1@S, it's not that likely we belong in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sound 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H over 1@C, sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: even sounder 2@S|pg||
nt|jtr: This is not possible|pg||
nt|athene: all this soundness and you might find yourself losing ten imps|pg||
nt|jtr: Sandbagging maybe?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: did West really open 1@C and then double 1@s?|pg||
nt|jtr: Wrong cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: would you pas 1@s with S hand?|pg||
nt|athene: it all seems unlikely :)|pg||
nt|toobad: best lead for def again|pg||
nt|mikeirl: a @D switch even at trick 2 is unlikely to cost and gives 2 chances |pg||
pc|d4|nt|sheila a: @s won't play as badly as all that, especially if the force in @h is avoided|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: it's a good auction but not on these hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You doubt that Marta is doing the right thing??|pg||
nt|sheila a: Short gave hard thought to making a game try; Walker gave none to declining it|pg||
nt|athene: repeated trump leads normal against this sort of contract, but they aren't hurting it|pg||
nt|steveray: not a triumph for support doubles|pg||
nt|athene: if double was support (3 spades) it does look odd to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S didn't promise five, did it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: East says i suppose i could have bid 4d|pg||
nt|idc: I wanted to show I keep up-to-date and wasn't going to let North steal my erudite comment, heh|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Shame on you!|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe West's 2nd @h must be suit preference, as the first was the attitude(count)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: very bad hand to try and get a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can always just draw trumps and make five tricks from trumps and four from clubs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzxx: and we are home :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: one trump, no certainly that partner has any entry at all|pg||
nt|toobad: oops............ undo??|pg||
nt|milton_se: oops|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, enterprising bidding by West, then |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marta made an error in 1991, not a single one after that|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Its nothing to do with support doubles Steve its the decision over 2@S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: well a simple 3@D over 2@S looks normal enough|pg||
nt|athene: even without erudite agreements :)|pg||
nt|steveray: does he believe  partner has another trump?|pg||
nt|athene: he probably just decided that a) west might well have 5+ spades and b) even if he doesn't, 4@S could be the right spot|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: home in a way, but 6@D was a nicer property to live in|pg||
nt|jtr: The whole bidding has dry rot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This auction is perhaps not textbook, but it is correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I've just noticed that cards A@s is swaped with k@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West would surely pass 1@S with his hand, opposite a partner who has passed |pg||
nt|ady: the auction seems odd  1@S overcall?   then re-opening with the west hand   and the opening1@C?   can anyone explain|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it is differs with bbo layout, but other cards are fine|pg||
nt|mdgraham: er, no|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think we have a Mystery|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they don't have the cards we see on our screens|pg||
nt|jtr: I think the hands got scambled in cyberspace|pg||
nt|jtr: No maybe about it Roland|pg||
nt|jtr: But surely Marta can see?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could it be board 27 or 28, Marta?|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Looks like a signal for clubs - perhaps Matheson hopes to persuade South to ruff high, not realising that he will not ruff at all|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 11 Ireland sailed into 4@h by the rare ploy of opening a 4 card major on the W hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|paulhac:  Probably worried that 3@C would not be forcing|pg||

nt|diana1: after that last board I didnt think David would pass 2NT:)|pg||
nt|athene: whenever you open a weak-2 and opps just bid 2nt - 3nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|diana1: he certainly has 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: here it's a bit different of course as west may feel his clubs could be a secret weapon|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: declarer can't really get cute, as the heart switch is too threatening|pg||
nt|athene: just return a club and claim your nine|pg||

nt|sheila a: It appears that E opened 4@s in 3rd seat on board 12|pg||
nt|athene: 4 imps sorry - they were NV so only 50|pg||
nt|athene: i would open west a 20-21 or 20-22 2nt|pg||
nt|toobad: lost the tempo|pg||
nt|toobad: he was home|pg||
nt|golfsquash: needed to exit in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Which made sure of not missing game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well that gets the job done!|pg||
nt|idc: to be fair to me, I was looking at the screen through a red mist ... sigh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E should have won on dumme and used his last @s for a thorw in on N|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: director back, 3 minutes now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: lots of aces and a 5-card suit - not even minimum for 2nt in my opinion|pg||
nt|toobad: undo|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: A very excellent job by our vugraph operator Marcin!! |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: thx|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: 6@S  on a finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: err...|pg||
nt|ady: assuming no heart ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: replay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: last hand and thx to all |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: action replay, no less|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|warrens:  there we go|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we are bakc in about 40 min |pg||
nt|warrens:  East needs to overtake and switch to a club if declarer ducks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jtr: North cant move|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if he does he will find out that they are off 2 keycards|pg||
nt|sheila a: Sime's opening ran the risk of keeping NS out of a non-making game|pg||
nt|mikeirl: imps for Scotland on Board 28 - E/W are in 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: you might even consider rising the @HK here, to start clubs from the right side|pg||
nt|athene: on the grounds that the spades are more of a worry than the hearts anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|toobad: thanks v much all..... laters!!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jtr: True|pg||
nt|justin c: double at other table, looking for @S lead|pg||
nt|sheila a: It looks like an opening bid to me, to be fair|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: sry, lost connection|pg||
nt|georgia19: we seem to have got to the last board skipping a lot - now what contract gives 29 imps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it went down here for a while, scots in 4h + 2, maybe 6 on|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: then they let out a 1nt|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: I agree - these 5-5s just have to be opened|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|warrens:  he can make this, but not simple|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sheila a: Feisty double from Matheson|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, they got every chance to stay out of it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Singleton in partner's suit and a trump trick - good combination|pg||
nt|sheila a: But Sime is thinking .....|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He pulled a double yesterday to a game he just might have made - hopefully he has learned something|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 5@D is trouble!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|sheila a: Phew!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to trust partner in these situations - gives you the shouting rights|pg||
nt|sheila a: That's the danger of doubling for one off - you give your partner another chance to bid :)|pg||
nt|idc: Two specs have asked the sensible question about the defensive carding last hand|pg||
nt|toobad: i suspect the hovering Director didnt help his play|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think Matheson is hoping for at least 2 down|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: normal to lead to a big one first with that suit, if you have enough entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|milton_se: no way to nine tricks unless South lets go of a spade -- or they set up a H|pg||
nt|athene: gain against Ax onside or stiff jack offside|pg||
nt|athene: ok that was last i think? thanks all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good time to finish, this - almost Beer Time where I live |pg||
pc|d4|nt|mikeirl: leads to 15/15|pg||
nt|idc: All the scores in except this Bd - so well done to England on their win|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: While this hand is taking its twelve winners, a genreal point: |pg||
nt|chick: heart will work though|pg||
nt|warrens:  West can pitch two clubs now.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jtr: Slight risk in taking the trump finesse|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only half way, Michael, lots more excitement to come :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 13 Walker managed to make 2@s, despite the 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes - solid bridge played here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|milton_se: 10D is killing|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dT|nt|sheila a: Double part score swing|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|milton_se: no! not any more...|pg||
nt|chick: I think he can still do it|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s9|nt|cuttysark: I note that Short did not open the North hand :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some of us play K for count and Ace fot attitude|pg||
nt|idc: so I should reply that I would encourage as North (high in their system)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|djneill:  this would be funny if it was East that was squeezed, not West|pg||
nt|warrens:  can't make it anymore.  but West will need to exit with the @C Q if declarer plays Ace and a @S now|pg||
nt|djneill:  how could he have made it warren|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sheila a: Does that earn him a brownie point from you?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: Half a mark|pg||
nt|mikeirl: will Garvey lead a low @C now?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|chick: S is squeezed in spades and hearts|pg||
nt|idc: but that I can't imagine not playing @hK at trick 2 as SOuth were I to decide to continue the suit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark: Better had, I think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: this was the last bd of the set, next set schedule after about 15 min break|pg||
nt|peachy: opearator, is that still the plan?|pg||
nt|sheila a: This match is very tight. Garvey and Carroll have played steadily|pg||
nt|mikeirl: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And thanks to Ronan for great operating under difficult circumstances!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|milton_se: 3 clubs mashes South|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|h8|nt|georgia19: very gracious, Ian, nice to have your company but I think the English had the rub of the green|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
mc|9|nt|djneill:  well done|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he can make it by cashing 2 rounds of @D's, then play Ace and a @S while he still had 4 @S's in dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx  all will cu soon  just over 1/2 hour |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: that's all for now, thanks all|pg||
nt|djneill:  think West can still play @cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: back in 30 minutes from now|pg||
nt|warrens:  then West again would have to exit with the club Q, setting up a potential squeeze of East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: 2:55 local time|pg||
nt|warrens:  but the squeeze doesn't work, so always down|pg||
nt|djneill:  ah even before the @d do that, so West can't get a count on anything|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, interesting, leave him his @D's and he has to guess to play the @c Q before he knows|pg||
nt|djneill:  yeah just play for him to have @sKQ and that's it|pg||
nt|warrens:  of course, against a 3rd seat vul 3-level opening, that might be a quick way to go down 4|pg||
nt|djneill:  right|pg||
nt|warrens:  Is West still thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: all done, he made it, W continued spades|pg||
nt|warrens:  did he exit with a small @C at the end?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: didn't catch final @c exit but he had cashed both spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: ok closing now, thanks all|pg||
pg||
