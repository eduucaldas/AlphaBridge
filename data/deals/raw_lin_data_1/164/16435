nt|Walddk2: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Serhat Ozenir|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree with pass by West - the DBL means only points, for sure not long @h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C would be forced|pg||

nt|vbman: so 1 nt is weak?|pg||

nt|Gerben42: this contract is much safer|pg||
nt|vbman: or 15-17?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14 balanced hands are opened 1@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like this 3@S bid with this flat hand and a known 8 card fit only|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|serhat: hi All|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|sfoxa:  N knows partner has maximum hand with @h|pg||

nt|tomi2: west will need to decide what ace partner has|pg||
nt|vbman: and the rebid after 1 red suit is?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: passed hoping in 2 @s tricks - difficult to think North void in @S !|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 12-14 they start a "rescue" sequence and try to find a ceah major fit before 1NT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nagini: only nuclear weapon against this transfers:)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: But you bid a major over 1@D (0-7) if you have 12-14. Can be 3 cards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nagini: on this level they rarely bid without a reason|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is not natural. it may include "any 0-6 hand"|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  next time it does no harm, but now E has the lead as described in a bridge book|pg||

nt|nagini: friends will be friends|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|tomi2: neither 1@C nor 1@D must be alerted in poland|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like a strip hand...but since clubs behave, no problems whatsoever|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s was not enough|pg||
nt|3for3: if the jack didnt fall, declarer would be able to trump 4th club, and perhaps throw in the opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: nie ma sensu raczej|pg||
nt|serhat: -3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In theory, this is a good save (only 500) but it matters little when their team-mates were pushed to 5@H at the other table|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nigel_k:  This one looks like it was lucky to escape undoubled|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: with seven @C the pass at 3@H is dangerous - in this sequence 4@C can be a strong hand, but only long suit - and with K@S sgl can pass at 4@S ...|pg||

mb|3H|nt|vbman: so there is no mistake in saying that poland is one of the top nations of bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: happy Appy:)|pg||
nt|nagini: a feeling in fingers counts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All roads lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|3for3: a @D lead can cause problems for declarer...|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: South, I think, even lives in Germany right now, working as a Bridge teacher|pg||
nt|tomi2: E/W play transfers over their 1@C opener, even undoubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Good judgment by South to pass|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Gerben42: Ciech. had a tough rebid with 5-5 inv.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the xfer at 1 level it is usefull to receive the lead from tha hand with points|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Gerben42: well done finding the 5-3 fit in the 4th suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: here you see the reason why support doubles were invented originally. I read somewhere that Rodwell was also fan of bidding 3 card suits if there is no other good bid available and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: he did not like to play in 3-3 fits when partner raised him with 3 cards in competive situations|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt now may be|pg||
pc|dK|nt|juror1: welcome Tezcan Sen of Turkey|pg||
nt|tez: he didnt.np|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Opposite a weak NT game is unlikely and Qxx in opponents suit is bad|pg||
nt|vbman: can bridge teaching supply a living in europe?|pg||
nt|tomi2: remember, this is the Polish Premiere LEague, so it starts with a round robin event, but they will play KO matches afterwards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poland keep recruiting new players through hard work by a lot of people. The Polish junior players are extremely good, and they have lots of them|pg||
nt|3for3: diamond lead breaks the late entry to dummy.  declarer will fail..|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tomi2: yes, especialy in Germany, we have lots of wealthy old people playing Bridge in their local clubs, who want to be better then their friends|pg||
nt|3for3: not too late to shift to the diamond, and give him a problem|pg||
nt|3for3: not obvious to lead into AKQJxx of a suit though|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 4@s to 3@d|pg||
nt|3for3: perhaps they play 3@S as forcing|pg||
nt|tez: ''2@d''|pg||
nt|3for3: north can infer diamonds are as you see them...partner might have led a stiff if he had one|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's our point of view|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D should not be some slamtry, both players were limited and made a non forcing bid to start with|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, 5@d might be only one down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: possible to make game here having Ax in both suit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||

pc|c4|nt|Gerben42: evening|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42: friendly @c break sees this home|pg||
nt|othered1: with everything very friendly from this point, GIB (who peeks) would likely make an overtrick.  Here, though, declarer is looking for the safest line for 4. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now easy to make 10 tricks, because A in @C must be in West, so small @C from dummy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vbman: l also very much appreciate the german national team|pg||
nt|tomi2: the main aim from all teams is to finish top 8 here in this round robin|pg||
nt|tomi2: thank you :)|pg||
nt|vbman: any co?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  At the other table South tried for game and 3@h failed by a trick|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As you can see declarer has no choice but to play for @sK onside|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but no communication to play this line having a loser in @d|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|c6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vbman: carry over?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|tomi2: the guys were always happy to play events in Turkey, like Istanbul 2004 or other open events!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tomi2: there will be carry over but not significant, most important is, that the top 4 teams need to win 1 match only to get to semifinals|pg||
nt|tomi2: and if they lose they get a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|vbman: and u bet they do very well, burrying opponents|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5-8 teams first need to win among this group and then against one of the 1-4 losers|pg||
nt|vbman: seems fair enough|pg||
nt|tomi2: but any of the first 8 teams may become Polish champion while the teams ranked 9-16 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|3for3: too late for diamond shift...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2: with the 9-12 teams having similar advantage while the 13-16 teams will have to work hard, if they don't want to play in 2nd devision next year|pg||
nt|vbman: blew some tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: the "Katok" team basicly consists of players from Belarus and Lithuania, but they were welcome to join the polish league system and made their way throught the lower leagues and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: are constant members of 1st devision|pg||
nt|vbman: they have polish nationality?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tomi2: east tried not to joker around in teams, thats good. a small heart would have cut declarer from the club tricks, but he took the safer way for -1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tomi2: its always difficult for "outsiders" to identify the teams, because neraly all of them have companies as sponsor, so their teams are called so|pg||

nt|jcmax: As it did this particular South :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: Some players believe in the rule hcp + number of spades >= 15, otherwise don't open in last seat.|pg||
nt|serhat: true but I think S had a good hand|pg||
nt|nagini: flat one|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: teams from south and west, lke Wroclaw, play among themselfes in another city|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish 1@C by North now I assume. 1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nagini: winner are always winners|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: riski 3 cl|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but right time for it|pg||
nt|tomi2: what I find interesting is that both NS pairs, using the same methods, chose different bids on every of the first 4 hands|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 1 N tried to support partner with 3@S, in board 2 south started with a double and ot 1NT|pg||
nt|nagini: hard to stop before 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: most of the teams we see this weekend are from Warsaw|pg||
nt|vbman: so how long does it last and how many times is it held in a year?|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he had opened there would have been a danger of the pair getting to 3@H which would have been one level too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 5@c is not so bad|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: true Dany :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you start with 2 weekends rond robin, this is the 2nd one, and then several KO matches. The finals will be held in may|pg||
nt|vbman: no 3h will be the limit|pg||
nt|tomi2: the winner will represent Poland in the next European Champions Cup|pg||
nt|tez: flat 3NT|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|tomi2: in 3 N went directly to the major game not trying for 3NT and in 2 they tried to invite balanced instead of going towards a @D contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am in doubt now as the 1@H response is not Polish|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|antoniz: odzywka praktyczna|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well bid|pg||
nt|tez: double dummy play..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for bridge players it is important to have good gadgets after 1ANY pass pass|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: 2@H after dbl 17+|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3NT very much looks like fast arrival to me, meaning partner I have a really bad hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-6(7)  and 1@H therefore 8+, but maybe only 7+ for them|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nigel_k:  3NT needs partner to have something in hearts, but making 11 tricks in diamonds needs a lot more|pg||
nt|nagini: want to play hearts? not a good idea:)|pg||
nt|vbman: oh my|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S by Vainikonis tends to promise 5 spades in Poland|pg||
nt|tomi2: they like to make "heavy" 1@S bids on 4 spades and some points|pg||
nt|serhat: exciting on a dia lead!|pg||
nt|jcmax: W definitely found the best elad!|pg||
nt|serhat: so 4s was better|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tomi2: wow thats some double swing|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C hit the jackpot here|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c dbl was not penalty for sure|pg||
nt|vbman: so north hand is close to 1sp or a q|pg||
nt|tomi2: east should pass as long as he is not doubled and later think of correcting to 5@D|pg||
nt|3for3: declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|3for3: defense can build 2@H's and take 3 aces|pg||
nt|jcmax: And also note how important it is he chose a low @D and not the 10|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tez: i would bid 3@c with west hand..you?|pg||
nt|tomi2: while this 2@S bid may be standard in USA or France, this is a 1@S bid in Polish methods|pg||

nt|jcmax: It really depends. If you have reasons to assume there is at most a doubleton in dummy then a low one clearly would be best even from the first holding.|pg||

mb|p|nt|nagini: felt it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tez: my asistant says ''we say "side suit first" :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most of the breaks will be because most Polish players smoke - so they need a short time in such 12 board matches|pg||
nt|serhat: nice 7h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: even if he went down it would gain lots of imps since NS made 4@S over there|pg||

nt|nagini: personally I would choose  pepsi a pd|pg||
nt|vbman: smoking kills|pg||
nt|tomi2: this hand is easy in polish club, you open 1@C and start counting your points. For EW here 1@C is a limited opening, so Jagniewski had to guess or count his points first before ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: opening|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tez: in vuln normal 3@h opening|pg||
nt|nagini: one condition only: as my sponsor:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: light openung|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: the best movement for the players was "4-board BAM swiss" so they had to wait for the other results and couls smore every 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: players was talking about previous board|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think with wests hand you should not force your partnership to the 5th level if you start the match leading in the 25 VP margin|pg||
nt|nagini: eee|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nagini: pepsi has a feeling in fingers:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad controls isnt worth 12|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but I by today's standards, it's pretty sound -- a couple of 10's, and a couple of honor tricks make up for the acelessness.|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, if you can get them to take a phantom save, vul, it does have its merits.|pg||
nt|tomi2: you already need a good dummy to cause s relative flat score compared to passing 4@H with those two major aces|pg||
nt|jcmax: Shall we predict they will bid 7N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: good correction to 5@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if partner cannot open 2@S, probably the suit is insufficient|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bridge_one: 2@D of course is multi - long @h or @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: if 4@H was making you need to escape for -3 maximum to have a relatively flat board|pg||
nt|tomi2: while you need a huge dummy to turn a bad baord into a good one - but this will not bring you more VP tan you already have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is an artificial game-force|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: but it riscs going down more or going down while 4@H was not making - in those scenarios you lose imps. so IMO bidding can win very seldom but lose very often|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|tomi2: the players don't know the running score but they know the score after 12 boards|pg||
nt|serhat: I dont think so..|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|othered1: Effective double by north.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be worried about @C now|pg||
nt|othered1: He can hold this to -1 with the right view on the minor suit positions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but might take a wrong view on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is to give the A in @D - cab be usefull for the lead|pg||

mb|3N|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0550.JPG this is north|pg||
nt|jcmax: When the opponents play relays I strongly feel with a hand like N's one should get involved in the bidding especially at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kwiecien asking, Jagniewski telling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would get in with 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: and they already had one board where they might expect to win imps and one where they might lose, wo it was not unlikely that the result was still 25-x at that point|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0569.JPG east|pg||
nt|3for3: df wanted declarer to run the 9 of @C through south.  It plays well :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcmax: I'd prefer 3@D personally|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: north needed to stay off hearts until south lead them.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, because 2@D will not hurt their relays|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Agree.  I wonder if the lead will give him an idea of the shape of the hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And then it makes no sense|pg||

nt|egezzer: actually|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  would he like to have bit of rest now? :-)|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SKQJ and 5 hearts with west|pg||
nt|tomi2: with semi-friendly clubs and the marked @D finesse 6NT should make. @C10 is dropping, so the 9 will be a trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|po-s: I think with side king + SQ he wouldm bid his king, but having shown DK already he only bid 5S|pg||

nt|Gerben42: the real question is did North have to back in after 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very good evaluation by West|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then you need enough entries for making this finese and later taking advantage of the @C trick. this way he sould not cash and finesse because @D back would kill the 4th club ...|pg||

nt|tomi2: 6@H i mean|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Hej Anita @H|pg||
nt|3for3: the danger of bidding 2@S is you are setting up partner to save in 4@S, when your hand has lots of defensive potential|pg||
nt|jcmax: Wow! i am wondering why N bid 2@D here instead of a straightforward 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whereas a suit response can be 0|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3N definitely looks like the contract he wants to play.|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@D apparently in their methods is forcing, but where does it lead?|pg||
nt|serhat: He might be thinking leading a H!?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcmax: Can slam really be on? and if the answer to that is no, then a bid like 2@D on another day may give away too much information to the opponents.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|tomi2: Russian coul have ducked the heart to cut the communication here|pg||
nt|vbman: yessss|pg||
nt|tomi2: hoping N will finesse again, then Vainikonis would have to do something in @D to get an entry for the spade finesse|pg||
nt|vbman: he can still go wrong easily|pg||
nt|tomi2: but if he had to cross in @D he could have finessed first, then west could win the queen, cross to partners @DA and get a ruff|pg||

nt|tez: 1@h MEANS Ý HAVE 1s2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 33 points on EW but no slam as far as I can see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably rdbl have another means (not A @D)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcmax: N's 2@S response doesn't promise anything extra, it just confirms the possession of 4 cards in @S|pg||
nt|tez: @s's i mean|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D =shortness..|pg||
nt|jcmax: Against 4@H EW can get a @D ruff, but only at the expense of a natural trump trick. Declarer however may misguess trumps and then 4@H could go down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: but made in CR|pg||
nt|tomi2: again some "Hamman" 3NT try, this time stopped by west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
nt|nagini: classic polish bluff|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||

nt|serhat: I think Kalida is taking easy as not Vul|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's say E had bid a preeemptive 3@D instead of 2@D (if available), then declarer may very well decide to play a @H to the K.|pg||
nt|serhat: he has to bid 4h now|pg||
nt|serhat: cant let 3nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Russyan did enough by doubling and bidding 2NT. I would have passed 3@H I must confess|pg||
nt|serhat: to be honest I am surprised he didnt bid 4h over 2nt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nagini: as smart as pepsi?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
nt|vbman: push board|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: am quite suprised that Russian did not bid 2@D after 1@S - that is a GF relay promising at least 3 card support in @S and enough for game|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: At IMPs you will play as safely as possible to make your contract, hence @SA is correct play|pg||
nt|tez: he didnt show void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at matchpoints, however, you must try to make as many tricks as possible, so finessing the queen is the right play|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, surprising, since partner's ace of @D could have been the K@S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
nt|tomi2: skipping the 2@D relay often indicates a) not such good 3 card support and/or b) a better heart suit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: this to give the possibility to defend knowing a minimum of 3 cards |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rest assured that Jagniewski will cash @SA at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is a very poor contract|pg||

pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: Peplonski insisted on @H then RKC, 3, thanks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|tomi2: but with @D ace he could affort to discard some club, even the queen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT ?!|pg||
nt|jcmax: Interesting to see whether EW will bid all the way up to 3NT here.|pg||
nt|nagini: hello|pg||
nt|jcmax: Or maybe they will just end up doubling their opponents?|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Deep Finess will insist of grand slam here|pg||
nt|tez: they can make 6@h ..@s lead|pg||
nt|nagini: :)|pg||
nt|serhat: but now 11 imps. I would not pass to 3nt unless I am looking for odd score|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tez: are they playing with screen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Olech's overcall was very light|pg||
nt|3for3: not sure i love 3@S overcall.  May push the opps to 4@H which they may not have reached on their own steam|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nigel_k:  If you play diamonds first and they break you now have 11 tricks and can play for a squeeze|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = max 3 cards support|pg||
nt|tomi2: Kowalski ince again found the killing lead|pg||
nt|vbman: no  h lead then margin is very wide|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: very aggressive|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tomi2: running J@s was ok play but before cashing A@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are going to take the money|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would not want to be in 3NT anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  real view wll lead to @s game|pg||
nt|tez: do you bid 4@h with N hand quickly|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: No-one can double so he will get away with it|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Low from a doubleton in Poland|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently 1NT was forcing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@H is the normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Funny looking auction, but it was systemic and got to the normal spot.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT was strong bal. 2@D = transfer to @H 2NT superaccept :)|pg||
nt|nagini: wow who did start this fitre?:)|pg||
nt|po-s: was 3D canape?|pg||
nt|nagini: they are hungry i thik|pg||
nt|nagini: dinner time|pg||
nt|po-s: 5-8, 5-7 ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If you play hearts first and they don't break your entries are destroyed even if the diamonds were 3-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: south showed a stiong hand with spades till now, north is just starting to show what he has. now its some medium hand with @Ds and @Cs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D = repeat xfer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: traffic light in his favior |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like 3 rounds of spades will get it 2 down|pg||
nt|nagini: boring finrsse|pg||
nt|nagini: feel 6 @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt means = choise the game|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: but no more communication, spades hearts and clbus are blocked ir isolated|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/liga/liga2010-11/pierwsza/LIrunda10.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Gerben42: retransfer, thanks|pg||
nt|nagini: will be a fire|pg||
nt|po-s: Does East know what is trumps?|pg||
nt|po-s: and since when?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tomi2: since they are GF now 3@D shows some interest, north has two aces, maye he will try for slam|pg||
nt|nagini: imagine|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|tomi2: if south had a better @H stopper and not such great fit, he would bid 3nt over 3@C directly|pg||
nt|tez: ty Monika|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so 420|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer may not read the lead as short, but it shouldn't matter as cards lie|pg||
nt|jcmax: It's not clear to me what the correct action with the N is. 4-card support for partner and relative shortness in @S seem to call for action.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: then South will also score his @H10|pg||
nt|jcmax: Bidding 1NT with the N hand ahead of partner seems rushing things a bit. He was really asking to get doubled!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|po-s: what if South doesn´t have the club king?|pg||
nt|nagini: claim 7|pg||
nt|othered1: or do thy lead rusinow?|pg||
nt|vbman: thats ok for me now thanks all and good luck to players|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tomi2: then he has 17 points and opens 1@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: thx|pg||
nt|tez: i dont agree with 3@s..i would bid 1@s|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jcmax: Partner may have problems reopening|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Oh well, he gets a small heart anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can score @H10 as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: small spade to the king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to do it first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Small spade, club|pg||
nt|po-s: aha, west thinks 3D is splinter...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Gerben42: still ruffing their own trick|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|3for3: and you are a passed hand, so partner won't move over that very often|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: and Koto can overruff |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now back to 1 down|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to do without peeking|pg||
nt|jcmax: But there really are not many hcp's|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|jcmax: It seems a better strategy to see what partner bids first. One can always bid 1NT later if one wishes to do so|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bridge_one: also 4@h down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: I would take my 500 any day of the week, even on a Sunday, whether I have 600 in 3NT or not|pg||

nt|Gerben42: perhaps they will show their 1@C 1N system again|pg||
nt|3for3: 1@C/1NT all pass?|pg||
nt|3for3: or might west compete with a major showing bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@h probably down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in the previous hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|serhat: 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No ideal bid for Kalita here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess one has double although that would indicate four spades|pg||
nt|tomi2: he could cash @S before to have 9 tricks for sure and finesse later or catch the singleton queen and play @S10 and then the other spades|pg||
nt|po-s: obviously quite clear to everybody...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weak jump shift, normally six cards, though|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: here 4@S ON also with A@C and @C lead because opener will play A@S and @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = 3 cards raise|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, move it up a notch :)|pg||
nt|nagini: very adressive style of bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ahh, this was better|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  that was the way, yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 3@H with 4cards raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is limit +|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tez: @c leads beat 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|nigel_k:  Some pairs play that double shows spades and 1@s denies them|pg||
nt|3for3: i dont like the lead, you know partner has real clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No game makes for N-S but that's because South has no opener (in my view)|pg||
nt|nagini: sped for to be down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Otherwise hands like North have no good bid|pg||
nt|nagini: nmf|pg||
nt|nagini: it's a hard work to fight in this position, no hope...:(|pg||
nt|gforce1: 5@H w PZ|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|frankaus: agree - only 25 zars - do u like zars  - i'm a fan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like popcorn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: zars the same as smarties?|pg||
nt|frankaus: zar's hand evalution system  - link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I stick to the 4321 scale but I am no fan. It is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|tomi2: Let me try to introduce the format they are playing here. This is the Polish Premiere League. 16 Teams play a compleate round robin on thwo weekends, so they will finish sunday but ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: then the "fun" will start. The field will be torn into groups of 4 - basicly its most important to be top 8 after sunday|pg||
nt|jcmax: Interesting decision not to lead a @C here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: but we are sure he will lead @d ace or @s ace|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tez: normal lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a kinitz told me 2NT is GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 2@C would be nmf. I guess they play some GF checkback or so|pg||
mb|5C|nt|tomi2: then the teams will play one "K-O" against teams from their group, the first 8 may still become Champions, the last 8 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
nt|tomi2: south just shows a balanced hand with 6 clubs and probably 3@S and not a good heart stop. interesting what north makes with those information havin 2 hearts only too|pg||
nt|tomi2: should Olanski do something here?|pg||
nt|nagini: gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C=any invit hand 2@D=any GF hand|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: board 9 2@C -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: take @c play @h first..you can make it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H = invite, 2Nt=GF both with raise in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a interesting option|pg||
mb|5D|nt|tomi2: playing this method south was not able to show a good/bad hand. he has 3 kings and one ace, but could have had some queens and jacks|pg||
nt|tomi2: and since he opened 1nt on AKAK last hand he cant have more than this|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: interesting choice by South to bid game with what loks like a lot of worthless black cards and bad trumps, the DQ as the only plus value - but lucky|pg||
nt|po-s: 3rd hand openings don´t deny an opening...|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Walddk2: OK; then they missed a trick|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am sure there are a number of players who would just have blasted 3NT on the N cards.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could you correct the score in MOVIE, Monia please?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Monika|pg||
mb|p|nt|trotto:  2@d = ask , 2nt 6 clubs , 3 @d relay ,  3@s= 3226 = , 4 @d - end signal( call P for bid 4 @h) 4 @s  = game @s sign off|pg||
nt|trotto:  tuszynski after  3 @s  bid knew about risky  to play  3 N    doubletons @h mirror|pg||
nt|nagini: i would prefer yo play longest suits... but whathever yuo wish sir:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me know if you need the code|pg||
nt|jcmax: It looks like 8 tricks on top and where there is 8 there is 9 they say. Not on this hand though.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2CSX-2|pg||
nt|serhat: I think I would bid 3nt over 1h|pg||
nt|jcmax: If N had Axx in @S instead he could hold up twice in @S and make 3N. So mental note Axx is always better than Ax when cosidering bidding 3N :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: so this sequence must show mild slam interest from partner and south could go on imo|pg||
nt|nagini: would prefer 3 nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: i think he showed a weaker hand than he has with the 2@H bid. I guess he had some constructive raise available.|pg||
nt|3for3: 4 trick swing on the lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|frankaus: A & K get better evaluated - Q,s down graded|pg||
nt|serhat: I dont think Axx is or Ax is matter on this hand Sabina. we dont know anything about H's! do we? it is just tactical bid!|pg||
nt|serhat: it might end succesful|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nagini: 6 sp 1430|pg||
nt|jcmax: No it's not a matter, only the difference between being able to make 3N or not.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tez: now need to play @s ..from hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: An ace is definitely worth more than 4, and the jack is not worth 1|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  friendly lead, but declarer has a lot of work anyway|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|nagini: 6 cl 1370 only:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: my opps often cash two aces when i play 6@S without them, and woth no fit and no @SQ|pg||
nt|nagini: Apek does know his work:)|pg||
nt|nagini: tuszek wake up:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  when defence would have started with A @h and @h, declarer would be in trouble|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tomi2: teams, who finished higher in the RR have some carry over, and most important, the top teams may affort to lose one match in beteween|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in Italy use 2Nt = 3 cards limit+ and 3@H =4 cards limit+|pg||

nt|nagini: wow|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many bid 5@S = no Q, 5Nt = Q, 6@C = Q + 1K etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And diamonds are out of course|pg||
nt|jcmax: This is not the best defence. s would have done better to shift tio a @C|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: When declarer follows with the queen, the jack is a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now seven with K in @h|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer may not have enough communication though to "misguess" the trump suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nigel_k:  Good defence to continue trumps|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree with declarers line though it didn't work - this is usually the case only when I am declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like as S should have played a @s in trick2|pg||
nt|warrens:  trying for 7, but I don't think he'll make 6 |pg||

nt|tez: we will see endplay soon|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Gerben42: maybe with good intermediates I would open it anyway - depends on mood |pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: yes, hard also 6|pg||
nt|tomi2: whatever their bids mean, they play a good contract rightsided now. he has one discard on @H at least and one on spades, so it does not need @D finesse. and with this lead he even ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: survives 4-0 trumps|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: So a club or heart. Everything could cost a trick|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now declarer can pitch all his @C losers away|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|nagini: dead  man:)|pg||
nt|tez: no need endplay sry|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  if declarer plays spades by trying to cash the Ace, he's down for sure, but I think he's down even if he plays towards dummy (assuming East ruffs)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|warrens:  if he plays a spade, East ruffs and plays another trump.  now declarer has 5@D, 2@S, 2@H and 1@C.  can't even ruff one spade since East can ruff again|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That's why they call it the blind lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are very difficult most of the time|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, very much so indeed! Actually there are players who feel that part of the game should be removed and dummy shuold go down before the opening lead is made.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Second half at 11.00 CET, in 35 minutes|pg||
nt|nagini: to late but finally they bid what they have:)|pg||
nt|nagini: ooops|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tomi2: 2@D might be a transfer to hearts, showing some at least mild invitational hand. playing this method 2@H becomes "GF in @D". quite popular in the Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: better idea|pg||
nt|jcmax: W redoubles no doubt to show the @DA. That will make it easy for E to bid 3NT|pg||

nt|nagini: = just made|pg||
nt|trotto: because kibs are still asking for Kowaski-Tuszynski's system, I'll explain: after several relays when the distribution is known, 3nt is to play, 4@d is artificial, forcing to ...|pg||
nt|trotto: mandatory 4@h (and then pass on any bid of P) , while 4@c/4@h/4@s / 4nt are preferential blackwoods|pg||
nt|tez: other table bid 3 nt..brave @h|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is a very good idea to discuss with your partner your methods after the opponents double a cuebid. With proper agreements the opponents double can make it even easier to get to ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: the correct spot.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: passing a easy 3Nt (lead @H...)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Next set at 12.00 local time, in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|frankaus: what sort of polish name is that  - it even has a vowel or 2|pg||
nt|trotto: bd   10|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like E/W will scramble to 4@S or 5@C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: it seems to be usefull as long as you dont forget about this too often, because then its quite expensive :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: That is why many players reverse the meaning of double and pass over a cuebid of partner's suit.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcmax: So as not to give the opponents extra bidding space.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very busy vugraph day with broadcasts from Poland, Norway, India, Ireland and Switzerland. At some point we will have 12 tables up |pg||

nt|nagini: so have some food:):) ty:)|pg||
nt|trotto: e.g. if the opener has distrubution like 3-3-1-6 and the last answer to relay was 3@h, then 3@s = rkcb on @c fixed (because @c are the longest) 3nt to play, 4@c - rkcb on @s fixed ...|pg||
nt|trotto: (because if 2 suits are equal priority goes to major suit), 4@d - as explained above, 4@h rkcb @h, 4@s rkcb @d |pg||

pc|d2|nt|tomi2: his plan was to attack declarer in trumps with that weak ones in dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|warrens:  but I think declarer will get endplayed in dummy at the end and be forced to give a trump promotion.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally 2 trick in the trump, and after all the goood cards - when opps ruff remain with one trump - now you play last trump and make the rest of tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh well, dead now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: no possibility here because no communication to play the last trump after the ruff of @D|pg||
