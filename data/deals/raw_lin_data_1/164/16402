nt|Walddk4: What was the contract and result on 17, guys?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OK; done|pg||
nt|paulg:  we have seen a lot of two-suiters tonight, perhaps the theme of the weekend|pg||

nt|vugraphzxz: ok we are back! lost the play on 19, sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: well played :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT for EW here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
nt|paulg:  the play on 19 would have been uninteresting, we can live without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: figured as much :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|2D|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes and about as difficult to make as the last one |pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: double explained as promising 3 @Hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|greerm: seems a simpel 1 off, anyone see anything lese?|pg||
nt|justin c: too early for difficult contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Give us Man Utd|pg||
nt|bt: what are the chances of that roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Non-existent|pg||
nt|bt: seems board 23-24 are slightly favorable for skara|pg||
nt|bt: well skara is winning here so|pg||
mb|5C|nt|chessmaste: Looks like the same ten tricks too|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: very hard for Vi to imagine that Charles has also 3 losing @hs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|xenya: but this might make|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bt: the natural play works|pg||
pc|d2|nt|diana1: so early on in the match she is probably going for what she thinks is the safest thing|pg||
nt|paulg:  all the reasons are there to make North declarer on this hand, but it just did not work here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|pg||

nt|greerm: but when dbl promises 3H, then he had a different decision|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sheila a: This is the slight downside to the Multi, in that it's easier for E to come in over 2@d than 2@s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|greerm: 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|diana1: very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: likely to finish in a partcsore --1NT or 2@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: not the greatest dummy but has chances|pg||
nt|greerm: in theory 4@C 2@S 2@D and 1@H |pg||
nt|greerm: can the defence chalenge that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3NT or 4@S here i think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@S is possible|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  i don't think they can, but a few concerns for declarer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  the upside is that West may not have a cue bid available|pg||
pc|hA|nt|greerm: he that hesitates is lost ?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bt: we had an undo. makes more sense now. maybe there should be a bid for the west hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|justin c: intra the @S suit :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes I forgot we all overbid here nbecause we are such great card players these days |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will not be easy - at the very least needs an intra finesse in spades  |pg||
pc|s5|nt|sheila a: I think if partner bids one major have to use the other as a cue|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|xenya: 2@C by W would have been the winner, but perhaps that is not allowed by their system|pg||

pc|sK|nt|bt: people usually dont work much on 1X-(1N)-?? in their system, pretty common auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|greerm: looks like defence can make it difficult but not quite difficult enough|pg||
nt|greerm: @C now only postpones it|pg||

mb|3C|nt|greerm: a spirited dbl by I H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: another push board|pg||

nt|paulg:  With more than half the set to play, a test of character for them now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|diana1: so it wouldnt surprise me if the other E/W pair find their @s fit on that last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  West removing socks to count points|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the other room they're playing strong NT so would open 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: this is the type of slam you want to be in when it makes|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure about declarer's line though -- playing on spades rather than clubs looked better|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bt: i thought this was the 1@S = i have 13 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S suction - so one suit hand in @C or two suit @D+@H|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|bt: kinda both hands actually|pg||
nt|paulg:  and a weak 5-6 hand with a void in partner's suit is probably not what you were looking for, but things will improve|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt: @C and @D+@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2NT shows 22-23 balanced|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  could be blamed now :)|pg||
nt|diana1: yes probably or else he is upgrading his hand and showing the normal 23-24|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|greerm: 6-5 come alive |pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  2NT is a minor pre-empt, so they may play some form of kokish|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bridge_one: 4@S with A A and Q of trump is conservative|pg||
nt|bt: y i agree, was a sweet hand|pg||
nt|diana1: yes I think they do|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Vi knows this is from 3 she can duck|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  still only four tricks for the defence ... really need to lead both blacks suits to trick one|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bt: i assume west didnt splinter because of @CA singelton, and east then assumed no shortness, thats the only explanation for 4@S on such a prime hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  and, naturally, continue both blacks suits when in with the diamond|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||

nt|othered1: Who can bid 4@D?|pg||

mb|4D|nt|paulg:  but you can probably get more from 5@h-X|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|bt: can discard a sapde and a club, what next|pg||
nt|diana1: they are obviously playing transfer responses to 1@c here and the 1@s bid denies 3@hs |pg||
nt|paulg:  not so obvious I'm afraid|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@ss rather|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h shows any 12+ and 1@s shows 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|diana1: I know that David and Rex in the other room do |pg||
nt|paulg:  then 2@h is a transfer to spades followed by invitational 2NT|pg||
nt|diana1: ok|pg||

nt|greerm: 3NT by NS now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|diablo666: Nope, sry. Staffan will check it out...|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: not the world's best 4 card minor|pg||

nt|paulg:  there could be blood if East doubles|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: ty staffan|pg||

nt|diana1: it really is - has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 2NT?|pg||
mb|d|an|t/o|mb|p|nt|greerm: that might deny 2@H in which case N will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes in these auctions someone just has to bid notrump even with Jxx|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: many pair use the open of 4@C, in first and second position, with long suit in ! closed and A or K out - here the advantage to play natural|pg||
