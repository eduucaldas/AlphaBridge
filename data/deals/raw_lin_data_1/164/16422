nt|justin c: dont know their bidding methods, but would have thought 2@C more normal for North than transfer|pg||
nt|justin c: intending 4@C over 2M, or 3@H over 2@D|pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT-2@C-2@H-4@C looks like it might get the job done on this one|pg||
nt|justin c: even on actual auction, N might have bid 4@C over 3@S|pg||
nt|justin c: (should be understood as shortage - he can bid 3NT with a balanced slam invite)|pg||
nt|justin c: i think this was the last board|pg||
nt|justin c: as best I can tell|pg||
