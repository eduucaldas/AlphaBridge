nt|Walddk3: North was able to show 1 keycard, @SQ and @HK|pg||

nt|hedyg: standings and results after round 9: http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2011/jun11-f.pdf|pg||

nt|Walddk3: He promised it himself when he bid 5NT|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe NS in the other room just agreed on very solid 4-level pre-empts :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|neobas: On top of that, 4-level pre-empts are usually 8-card suits so he expected a 10 card fit and at least a 9 card fit, not that bad|pg||

nt|vugraphzyh: 4@S for me, although |pg||
nt|vugraphzyh: I would prefer having the 4 suiter in a minor|pg||
nt|neobas: Well, I would probably open 1@S with that but with KQJxxxx x Kxxx x I guess I would open 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: i can open 4@s with 6-5 as well, but the fair point is that if you opened like that, then your @s's tend to be good, at least KQJ or so|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzyj: this is a pairs competition (IMPs).. the comperison here is just from 1 table...|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this may be more tricky|pg||
nt|sybarra2: oh ok |pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|othered1: probably a drury type auction and they may miss the great-fitting game|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you dont have a 1@s opening|pg||
nt|neobas: I guess with Majors it is less imperative to get in early, and if p opens 1@D you can still always upgrade to an opening|pg||

nt|vugraphzyh: he lost 3 spades and 1 club|pg||
