mb|2D|nt|galadriel: The Gods haven't dealt Walker many @Ss sos far|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Good result for the Scots this|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: 4@H and 5@C are on for N-S|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|jbgood: 4@s might have been taken 3 down - a very lucky escape for W in the CR|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|roghog: 3@h is a bit of a stretch, but it's a nice suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps they will do better here|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They will|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because they can make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|galadriel: I can understand Walker does not wish to defend here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: 500 still better :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hello everyone!|pg||
nt|sybarra: David Greenwood, West is one of our fellow commentators |pg||
nt|pfbr: hi all|pg||
nt|toobad: 3nt by E/W here|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome|pg||
nt|toobad: preferable to 4 @H?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|milton_se: good morning Sandie, Ralf, Paul|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeirl: Hi Jystin|pg||
nt|toobad: flat game in any event|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning all :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|milton_se: fit jump, it seems|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  Jones/Jones play Acol, Sime/Matheson play 5-card majors, strong notrump|pg||
mb|3S|nt|justin c: 4@h is where you want to be|pg||
nt|justin c: but not so easy to figure that out|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C = 11+ nat|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Just caught up. will enter final result:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Geoff |pg||
nt|toobad: afternoon Geoff|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: definitely the hot seat........like a sauna in here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Burns asking questions of 2nt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: err  is that right?|pg||
nt|sybarra: in Philly,  I was in the "freezer room"   ....players arrived with coats on,  enjoy the heat |pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|milton_se: trumps 3-2, no drama|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 5@C cheaper than 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not if NS can find their @s ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think Sime will bid 4@s here, which will give Daffyd Jones an interesting problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but this can go down|pg||
nt|athene: would 4nt be general takeout now?|pg||
nt|athene: having limited his hand with 4@H |pg||
nt|athene: it can't really be blackwood|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: Northern Ireland needs more "swingy" bds |pg||
nt|idc: Good morning Bill, and everyone|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  best defence will take this down 3 ... and they are on the road to that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pfbr: swingy in their direction :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes indeed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi John|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|rmb1: Sorry 2@C = clubs INV+ or other GF, 2@D relay|pg||
nt|justin c: i should have more faith|pg||
nt|mikeirl: S attack best|pg||
nt|justin c: imagined that N would try harder to play in @C|pg||
nt|toobad: this should be off a trick in each suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|justin c: knows he is being forced if @H trumps, but the short hand taking the tap in @C|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very easy to get the two diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Seems as a flatty. 120 tr|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10 tr|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the necessity of making one more trick for game may have influenced his thinking|pg||
nt|rmb1: Trumps 3-3 makes this easy in practice but not before some agonising|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzxy: Jones asking system|pg||
nt|toobad: Hi Robin|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: the only big hurdle was finding the opening lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|rmb1: North doesn't need @HA for opening bid.  But declarer has got it right|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|athene: it's not totally trivial because sometimes with that sort of holding you have to attack one of your suits and use the @DA to get in to cash them|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|d4|pg||
mc|9|nt|idc: Not very friendly to be doubling the first contract of the day|pg||
nt|athene: cashing the @DA at trick 1 does hold some risk of giving away a vital tempo, setting up a side suit for declarer|pg||
nt|idc: But at least it will blow the sleep out of declarer's eyes|pg||
nt|athene: oops|pg||
nt|paulg:  the other danger of cashing the @dA is that partner will not read it|pg||
pg||

mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: N-S are not even close to making 4@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: And why would you save with the West hand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: You have lots of defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: He wants to defend the 5 level perhaps?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand 5@C at all|pg||
nt|jbgood: what about the opening? Ace and king, and excluding 3 NT?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'd open 1@C before 4|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: In fairness, he only has three cards in the majors, so 4@C can be right|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i guess it's quick run through|pg||
nt|mikeirl: assume there was more to the bidding than recorded :)|pg||
nt|steveray: saves time opening with the best contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: both pairs play strong NT and 5 card majors|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thats one way of retaining trump control :)|pg||
nt|justin c: temporarily, anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least your fingers move|pg||
nt|toobad: 6c here, but hard to bid|pg||
nt|athene: south wasn't in on the plot?|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for Scotland|pg||
nt|athene: no way north is leading a random @DA there, with both other side suits known to be held|pg||
nt|athene: definitely south's fault i think|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rmb1: NS may not bid on first round|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: S for a opening? Y|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
nt|athene: west has a lot more club support than you normally have when partner opens 4|pg||
nt|athene: but the rest of his hand says defend...|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime planning to double 4@s or take the save?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Have to avoid losing two spades in 4@H but defence may establish @CQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry just catching up|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ok|pg||
nt|steveray: hard to see this making|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  3NT is harder|pg||
nt|sybarra: S may enter the bidding this round|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Feel NS are in trouble|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes. D lead shoul beat |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the end of 3NT then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would like the see the bidding, i cant understand why they arent in 4@H|pg||
nt|steveray: assuming East opened 1@C South should not take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c "natural", ostensibly 5+ clubs and a major or 6+ clubs with enough to open the bidding|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh boy ...................|pg||
nt|toobad: a bit frisky by S at the vulnerability..|pg||
nt|athene: neither, i would think|pg||
nt|idc: will sime dbl?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he might double|pg||
mb|5C|nt|toobad: 2nt now??|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: y :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but being in third position at favourable is enough to open the bidding nowadays|pg||
nt|mrt2000: trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@C = nat, limited (6+ or 5C+4M)|pg||
nt|sybarra: havent gotten to card yet, is is some form of flannery?  (I may get killed for mentioning that word) |pg||
nt|toobad: a @H lead ducked by S woud have been really unpleasant for declarer|pg||
nt|toobad: short and sweet|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a discussion every partnership needs to have,  is 2 @D forcing by passed hand?  (I think not,  cue bid only force) |pg||
nt|idc: Beimg Aceless on this sort of auction is a minus|pg||
mb|d|nt|milton_se: won't be happy |pg||
nt|pfbr: :(|pg||
nt|mrt2000: happier than if doubled!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: N must have seen his partner's overcalls before|pg||
nt|toobad: 3c from Ian is v tame|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: E? Who have the rest of the pints?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Could have been a interestin 6@D if opp was 1-3 at @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for North to act with all but one of his points in opponents suits|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for South - best is probably not to shift to spades, but it looks an obvious defence to follow|pg||
nt|idc: and holding KJx in partner's suit an even bigger minus for doubling|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i disagree with Sime's strategy here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|paulg:  either bid 5@c on the first round or pass/double 4M|pg||
nt|idc: Puts more pressure on opponents to bid 5@c straightaway, yes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: Second best|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzxa: N thinking...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on that lead, this may only go 1 off|pg||
nt|milton_se: he might have feared that 4S was playable|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: and down we go |pg||
nt|idc: North may stretch to bid over 5@c with some shape|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|milton_se: 2C overcall doesn't contain five spades very often ...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Fin|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, i think 5@c immediately is likely to be best|pg||
nt|athene: south will try to cater for 5 spades and @DK with partner|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: as well as just the two aces cashing|pg||
nt|athene: so he lays down the @DA first to see what partner has to say about that|pg||
nt|idc: or if North passes, a second dbl from South is a bit undefined as to how takeout-ish it is|pg||
pg||

nt|roghog: a more typical 4-minor opener|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|nt|galadriel: a full blooded 5 in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'd open 3NT, broken minor, as I use 4@D for something else|pg||

nt|rmb1: ok|pg||
nt|paulg:  two doubled contracts to start with, an exciting set coming?|pg||
nt|athene: and another 4minor opener :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@d at this vul|pg||
nt|athene: of course he might not be able to make it (he might play silly artificial 4minor openers or something)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rodal f: A new interestin spot NS this time|pg||
nt|sybarra: landing in 3 nt by e/w?|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: A interesting hand|pg||

nt|mrt2000: 6@C anybody?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello emre |pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, 4@d shows spades for them|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: hai all|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@H=1S|pg||
nt|idc: 5-4-2-2 is close enough to balanced and the 5-level is awfully high already|pg||
pc|sK|nt|justin c: @CK lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: possible to make -- but I wouldn't like to be here :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  although Sime could hardly be worse and you'd expect to make 5@h|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: Interesting. Need @H lead for stop a 6er|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have one chance more|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: he might - the cards are fairly well disposed|pg||
nt|toobad: started with 12 finished with 10|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5422 with a trump trick is not at all a hard decision in my view|pg||
nt|idc: Looking at North's hand on opening lead, there must be a case for a @c|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: 2@S=force|pg||
nt|insia1: will they go to slam ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C allowing partner to judge what to do over 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hJ on side  in 6@c|pg||
nt|milton_se: there|pg||
nt|sybarra: anderson showing good judgement, as much as he would like to be in red game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|justin c: can subsequently promote @S10|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3@D showed a @H suit here|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT = 16+ BAL|pg||
pc|h3|nt|steveray: but 5@H is cold on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rmb1: And NS judged to give up quietly ?|pg||
nt|justin c: if dec ducks trick 1, needs @h underlead later|pg||
nt|justin c: bit easier from where we are sitting|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@C to come|pg||
nt|toobad: 6c is a great contract|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, South would be on lead on this auction of course|pg||
nt|idc: I supose a @s from South would also do|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: And the @C blowed away after the invit 3@D|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 10 or 11 tricks here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Hi Meddy:)|pg||
nt|steveray: North needs partner to play a club before the D@s are set up|pg||
nt|steveray: Diamonds that is|pg||
nt|dburn: one of these days, the English will lead trumps when declarer actually has some diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no great matter against a part score|pg||
nt|rmb1: Less good opposite 3442|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|idc: Can't complain to the dealing machine so far; these first few hands fun|pg||
nt|athene: declarer trying to get something going - set up a spade is almost impossible but you might set up a black-suit squeeze if the defence are very sleepy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: well done erichsen|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: but will south lead @C?|pg||
nt|steveray: might the @D be a singleton?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: odds on to|pg||
nt|rmb1: North can afford to be passive, but this is the most direct approach.  Hopefully 4@C bid will reap its rewards now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might take his partner for a singleton @D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer would not allow @DK to win if he had the ace|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hopefully selway will work that out|pg||
nt|justin c: is the West hand not worth a strong @C opening?|pg||
nt|justin c: seen worse|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe they dont get to game even then|pg||
pc|d4|nt|insia1: good bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make S hand as main and nwxt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe|pg||
nt|steveray: might expect the finesse to win|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he did |pg||
nt|paulg:  ruffing with the @d9 only tells the opponents that the @d8 might be an entry .. does not matter here, but careless talk can often cost|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: click on the partnership, to see the convention card|pg||
nt|egezzer: West is John Greenwood,Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe club lead ...after alert, which may have been "could be 2" |pg||
nt|idc: I should warn specs that comparisons may take some time to trickle through - other room still on their first board|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pfbr: david greenwood|pg||
nt|idc: and since they start with 15 & 16, they won't reach Bd 1 for a while|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker and Short then, not the Outreds, in the other room|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: the strong variety of 1@c has a higher lower bound for Carrot players than for Precision players|pg||
pc|h7|nt|insia1: I think he will drop @C, after finess @D|pg||
nt|idc: indeed|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|pfbr: (JTR) on bbo|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|jbgood: relay:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it, what would 3@C be?|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps a more constructive raise|pg||
nt|roghog: N was hoping to stay out of this, but he'll have to bid 3@d|pg||
nt|galadriel: Is Short tempted by 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe he is thinking about 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: snap, Anne too quick|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|galadriel: He knows pd has a big hand|pg||

nt|toobad: 3nt here for ns|pg||
mb|1H|nt|insia1: NS or EW will become a decl ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@D is a weak multi 0-7 (2M is 8-11)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime might bid a weak 2@s now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 4@D splinter (?)|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT now?|pg||
nt|dburn: more or less forced|pg||
nt|dburn: would like to double for penalty, of course, but...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  18 in open, South could open 3@C = both minors, weak|pg||
nt|athene: he's a disciplined fellow obviously - he'll wait until he has that @SJ :)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: a reason the Hogg does not bid 1 sp?|pg||
nt|toobad: not the sort of board NI require when searching for imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  it may not be an option of course|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would have some other way to bid the north hand, to show the big support right away - 3@D perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: this might be a semi-psychic ploy, trying to buy the contract more cheaply|pg||
nt|idc: I like to call hands like North's a mixed raise: 3@d showing something between a preemptive raise & vaule raise|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, 3@d often a mixed raise|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: "South could" in the sense that South was able to open|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: +1|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that rather woeful defence to two spades on board 18 appears not to have mattered very much|pg||
nt|justin c: yikes|pg||
nt|dburn: since North-South at the other table attempted Stayman redoubled|pg||
nt|milton_se: good nrakes|pg||

nt|sybarra: or 6 clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|milton_se: brakes|pg||
nt|idc: Hey, we have the beginnings of partnership harmony here!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mikeirl: unusual lead of Q@H - wud normally be asking to unblock the J|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think they stop in game |pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" zoomed passed that|pg||
nt|toobad: NI have bid the club slam on board 19|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: East asking questions|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: not that unusual - plenty of pairs play that the king asks for count or unblock, the queen or ace for attitude|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pfbr: yes|pg||
nt|egezzer: indeed|pg||
nt|toobad: cant see more than 5 being bid|pg||
nt|pfbr: i'm just optimistic :)|pg||
nt|egezzer: :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S will surely be found by some EW pairs|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s would be a fair save even when you get the spades wrong, so chances of a welsh pickup|pg||
nt|athene: even with the horrible misfit in the side suits (three club losers, @DKQ wasted) it is ok|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have ten hearts and you have ten spades it just can't be wrong to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding 1@s is fine when this is their hand and you need to suggest a save|pg||
pc|hA|nt|toobad: about the weather??|pg||

nt|steveray: thinks it is @C+@H??|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does he think 4@C is a 2 suited hand?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Does South think it is non-leaping michaels?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
nt|athene: east might think he is facing a 2-suiter, now, and bid 4@D rather than 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: seems like 8 tricks |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think he does|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@S lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be rapidly off|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: only 50s|pg||
nt|steveray: else he thought it was Gerber|pg||
nt|steveray: just joking|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2NT = GF raise of M (at least by unpassed hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i bet you dont even play Gerber Steve!|pg||
nt|sybarra: round about way of explaining here |pg||
nt|athene: if west really did have 5-6 reds, then east's hand would be very good for things like 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: with the black aces and diamond fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  the West hand is interesting ... many now use 2@c with a gf balanced hand so that 2@d promises five|pg||
nt|paulg:  however, bidding your second weakest suit is not always ideal|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that is much the best i think - garozzo advocated that for a long time with artificial continuations over 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: people are generally starting to catch up with him|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pitnor: d3-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can beat it |pg||
nt|paulg:  a bit to do here|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have a restricted choice dilemma in diamonds at some point|pg||
nt|idc: Matheson will spend some time but all the cards lie well for him|pg||
nt|athene: (cash ace and king, dropping a big one from north, and then you have to decide whether to finesse the nine)|pg||
nt|paulg:  not sure he'll have the entries to worry about it|pg||
nt|idc: True, and at that point he may well know North has 4 @s, making 4-2 @d a little more likely|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|athene: win this trick and go for spades seems normal|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|idc: Say he wins this, spade finesse & duck, or immediate duck - later wins, test spades and then has to guess @d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|steveray: not often - I only get weak hands|pg||
pc|s5|nt|toobad: 6d has chances on a non H lead|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|rmb1:  20 flat in 3@S-1.  McGann bid 3@S a couple of rounds earlier than Liggins|pg||

nt|idc: Best for defence probably @c switch now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: I'm the only one in Manchester who likes Gerber|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but not here |pg||
nt|steveray: nothing wrong with it|pg||
nt|athene: many people would lead a spade to the queen but even if the suit lies as well as it possibly can, you have to lose one, so you might as well take the deep finesse|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|rmb1: West and South know something went wrong, but what about East|pg||
nt|steveray: so how many down?|pg||
nt|idc: if they continue @h, declarer can set up a long spade to the heartless North|pg||

nt|ralfwil: an easy 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 clubs by n/s but not sure I want to be there|pg||
nt|athene: it's surprising how often it's necessary to cling onto three small in a key suit|pg||
nt|athene: to give declarer a guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitnor: just need to bid it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can become a funny hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|steveray: 3NT for E/W if they can get there|pg||
nt|pfbr: where is here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: you lose 1@d and 1@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  probably thought that the @dJ had already given the game away .. which it had|pg||
mb|1H|nt|toobad: the Hamiltons missed 3nt on board 20 so another 10 imps to Wales|pg||
nt|sybarra: Washington DC |pg||
nt|toobad: h goes on s|pg||
nt|toobad: doubt it|pg||
nt|rmb1: I thought South might open - should have known better|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: Polish clube with 1@D negative|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is over and above the @c guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: true..can disc 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you lose 1@D and are on 2 finesses?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Will E run out?|pg||

nt|pitnor: who is going to interuph over 3n?|pg||

nt|rmb1: Convention cards at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c inverted minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C is inverted,  meaning good hand no 4 card major|pg||
nt|toobad: it would suit me since i alwats play for Q over J with no info|pg||
nt|hedyg: because?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so serious 3nt,  looking for slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or to play?|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|steveray: N/S will be frustrated about the club position|pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 nt might have been making |pg||
nt|hedyg: nicely played|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Its like LeMans.. cant they play slow... ever|pg||
nt|rmb1: Same result in open room on  20 but NS got closer to 3NT, at least North bid NT :)|pg||
nt|toobad: 6 h??|pg||
nt|athene: ace and another heart, and draw trumps then finesse clubs the other way, would have been 170|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: And another 10 to England on  21.  South did not make a negative double and NS settled for 2NT+1|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wales have drawn level after a more conservative 4@d pre-empt from Walker on board 3|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|steveray: can E/W make 4@S|pg||
nt|rmb1: Have OR only played 3 boards or have we lost touch with them?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ghestem|pg||
nt|toobad: even the bad break doesnt beat this|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@D 3@S 4@C now?|pg||
nt|toobad: 4c i hope|pg||
nt|rmb1: Many can only splinter in opponents suit after an overcall|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 3@C  is ghestem   2 highest suits|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C = 11-13 BAL or 17+ (any)|pg||
nt|dburn: the two-way nature of the 1@c opening hurt a little - South can't make a negative double with a five count facing what might be a balanced 11|pg||
nt|justin c: East raising now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: how far?|pg||
nt|rmb1: If so, 4@D fit would work|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is diamonds i guess|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|rodal f: So EW a natural bidding system. @S=4+ as @H=4+|pg||
nt|mikeirl: dbl now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitnor: d and s sup i guess|pg||
nt|steveray: open playing board 2|pg||
nt|rmb1: I see the result is in from  2 now.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is West supposed to pass this?|pg||
nt|steveray: west starts with balanced rubbish and ends having a big decision to make|pg||
nt|mikeirl: miss defence to allow 3@cx to make|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nobody it seems got close to 4@H on  2 |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he hasn't shown anything and he has quite a lot|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rebid 1nt on N?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT yet again !!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pitnor: some inv|pg||
nt|athene: if south can now bid 3@H natural, north may go 3@S to highlight the club weakness|pg||
nt|athene: and then NS have a bit of a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 2@C asking, I presume|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s probably have serveral kinds of raises  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S being weaker, than the cue, etc |pg||
nt|hedyg: the other table is even faster|pg||
nt|athene: they won't like 3nt since they have told opps to lead clubs|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pitnor: disiplin is ok after that 1 s bid:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Standard lead seems to be?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: surely we're waiting on W|pg||
nt|toobad: another 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: but we dont get paid|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, we dont either|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they get paid by the number of cards they play in lifetime :) |pg||

nt|rmb1: 3NT? |pg||
nt|athene: but of course 3nt is where you want to be|pg||
nt|athene: south now wants to know how many clubs his partner has|pg||
mb|4D|nt|paulg:  4@h is where you want to be|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: could be a swing to NI|pg||
nt|athene: if north is 4-3-4-2 then 5@D is better than 3n|pg||
mb|5D|nt|pitnor: std carding too|pg||
nt|steveray: looks easy +300|pg||
mb|p|nt|insia1: Liliek keringat dingin lagi|pg||
nt|athene: but if north has three clubs of course you want to play 3n (or 4@H)|pg||
nt|idc: I think I'd try 3NT over 3@s - don't think it should promise stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and North may bid it now if 3@h promised 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: he loves to lead declarers suits, this time definitely best lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: well he didnt lead clubs this time |pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||

nt|sybarra: not clear to me that declarer can survive this one|pg||

mb|3H|nt|rmb1: On  21, NS made 3NT after a small diamond opening lead to @D10 |pg||
nt|athene: aggressive 3@H makes it very easy for south now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxa: akhmad said that 1@s must be 4cd, if he had 5cd @s he would bid 1nt|pg||
nt|steveray: on board 3 Ireland were pushed to 5@H - but it made for 8 imps|pg||
nt|rmb1: Presumably West thinking|pg||
nt|justin c: 800 odd on offer here|pg||
nt|dburn: wondering how short his partner is in diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play it here,  |pg||
nt|idc: South worth a slam try I feel, but presumably North will decline to cooperate being (sub) minimum|pg||
nt|athene: there is a case for starting hands like that south (game force, balanced) with 2@C rather than 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: depends on your subsequent methods but it can be easier if you set up the game force first|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may not get the chance to decline|pg||
nt|athene: of course you have to be playing 2@C as GF :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: or 4441 or similar 5440s|pg||
nt|paulg:  6@h is not a great contract, needing a finesse and 3-2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose no heart honour is a bit of a worry|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@s was the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Hmm, maybe that would be wet of me ... wouldn't blame anyone for just blasting|pg||
mb|5S|nt|dburn: and electing to try for slam in spades|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5@H by West op?|pg||
nt|toobad: no defence to these slams|pg||
nt|rmb1: Efficiently bid,  but I bet East thinks the singleton isnt the A and West has more in hearts/clubs|pg||
nt|toobad: indeed....... he'll fret about the H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: Burns would make a gd croupier|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Surpricing but good decision          this time for NS|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C = 3+, 1NT may be limited to 14, 2@D looks artificial and then we are guessing :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|pitnor: y...need to guess dia ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@D  new minor forcing|pg||
nt|steveray: N/S will reach 3NT and can make it with a good guess|pg||
nt|toobad: too dangerous to double at imps|pg||
nt|toobad: has he a fluffy tail??|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you might not need the diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: leading from Jxxx isnt popular but what's the alternative?|pg||
nt|rmb1: @D lead requires declarer to drop @CQ|pg||
nt|idc: Not sure the threats work for a squeeze|pg||
nt|paulg:  i will be pleasantly surprised if Short/Walker bid this|pg||
nt|athene: @SA lead (ok unlikely) or perhaps lead a spade to the queen and then duck spades and ruff down west's short ace|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mikeirl: I favour defense on D lead|pg||
nt|steveray: looks 50/50 to me|pg||
nt|athene: or lead the @S6 from hand and east flies in with his ace, scared you have a singleton|pg||
nt|idc: Ahh, missed the @sA dropping|pg||
nt|athene: so many luscious possibilities :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|steveray: clear the @Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot double|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rmb1: On  22 East did not open but stil played in 2@S -1|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|steveray: then cash an AK befor finessing in the other black suit|pg||
nt|milton_se: reasonable choice though, since North i more likely to have QS|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Hard to find, but @HJ is best def|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: Did. WD|pg||
pc|h6|nt|justin c: perhaps East's pass over 5@D was encouraging West to bid on here|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|idc: May have been right to play a @s immediately though, entries a bit sticky to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: he's a bit short of entries to try the spade to the queen line, so i think @S6 from hand is coming|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: but you are better to try that really early, before east knows the trumps are solid|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to go in with his ace if there is the possibility his partner has a trump trick|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still. Non vul u don'nt earn as much as u do at vul.    As long as 3@S seemed invitational|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  4 it looks as if NS found their @S stop for 3NT and still lost the first five @Hs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|steveray: the club finesse looks to be wrong now|pg||
nt|rmb1: Black suit squeeze for +1 :) If you don't get deflected into putting in @CJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: well, he can still make on a black suit squeeze on east, unless west returns a club now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: This line isn't unreasonable: some small squeeze chances with @d finesse in reserve but fails as cards lie|pg||

nt|athene: 4 is the goldilocks bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|steveray: the 1NT opening will get them to @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: with poor results|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that bid will annoy Carroll :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes south should obviously have opened 2@S to keep his partner from getting ideas|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: EW got there (@Hs) first :)|pg||

nt|paulg:  why bid 4@d when three wins the pot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: forcing NT, I believe|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a hand like that south, it's pretty rare that you will make more tricks in hearts than in spades, even if partner has a heart fit|pg||
nt|idc: I expect Dbl from East would have been takeout - Matheson a little fixed with his actual hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: west can reopen with a good hand and doubleton diamond|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||

nt|athene: when you have to launch KJ109xxx(x) from hand, you normally lead the king, because the only chance to escape for one loser is to snare a singleton queen, but here even that would ...|pg||
nt|athene: not help north, as he would still lose two trumps to the A87xx|pg||

nt|toobad: ty Geoff|pg||
nt|rmb1: If North plays spade and West plays diamonds the defence will get 7 tricks for -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and 27 is very good for Ireland also|pg||
mb|p|nt|steveray: hmm, difficult to deal with when they should be in spades|pg||
nt|milton_se: why not pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the double by N looks like a Zia double except surely has a special meaning here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe they play reversed doubles, i.e. X= i have NO @S honour and pass= i have 1|pg||
nt|toobad: dont lead spades|pg||
nt|athene: if north had chosen 1@D then south would probably have rebid 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D - 1@H; 1@S - 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Short rebid 2@h only on Bd 9 so they finished in 4@h rather than slam as here - so more IMPs to come for Scots|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: i suppose you set off on diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: hoping, some day, to ruff one in dummy|pg||
nt|idc: But Welsh have potential gain later on so still too close to call|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: that's the end of dummy |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  over the past few years, Scotland has beaten Wales but finished below them in the Camrose|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: And the lead gave 140. Next|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: 1NT = 6-12 (semi-forcing).  2@C rebid would be INV+ with spades or GF.  Difficult to get to @S part score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they did well keeping low, easy to get excited with 6/5 distribution|pg||
nt|steveray: yes, have to open one, then pass the raise - unlikely, better off where they are|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does Garvey know he won the trick?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: your lead partner!|pg||

nt|toobad: exactly|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it was right to ruff a heart early - then you elope with both small clubs in hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|idc: My last partner had me persuaded that 4-4-4-1 shapes are for defending|pg||
nt|athene: of course if you do that you give up any chance of making anything of the spades|pg||
pc|s9|nt|idc: he preferred passing anything fewer than 14 hcp or so|pg||
nt|paulg:  pass them all then Ian?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h5|nt|dburn: and indeed board 27 was worth ten more to Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: @C break, and @DQ right, and need to play W for the @SQ|pg||
nt|dburn: so we might have been doing a lot of running in order to stay still|pg||
nt|mikeirl: that discard can't be right?|pg||

nt|toobad: has just got worse for Ni|pg||
pc|d7|nt|steveray: sad when you can't bid a lovely 6 bagger like that|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: should just make this, lose 2@H and 2@S|pg||
nt|steveray: yes, Kath, should make, but I hate it:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|toobad: thx all|pg||
nt|toobad: tell me that is an undo Geoff|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzxy: no|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting choice of @s3 lead rather than @s2 in other room|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: silly to bid  3NT and watch them cash 5@H tricks |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will be back in 7:10 am Los Angeles, 10:10 am New York, 16.10 Paris, 3:10 pm London|pg||

nt|hedyg: CC says reverse attitude|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: perhaps neutral as to suit preference for a return>?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|steveray: Not uggesting they should bid 3NT, 3@d is the contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: "silly" is relative,  Some would say declarer Axxx/xxx instead of KQJxxx/Ax was silly |pg||
nt|sybarra: or just about 1 hours |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps @s2 should be led when you have a ace or king of clubs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|egezzer: thx Shirley|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  or singleton|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|idc: agree|pg||
nt|paulg:  i can imagine taking a lot of time to decide what to do, and still not knowing what is best|pg||
nt|athene: he is just trying to work out if there is any way he can make with the @DK wrong|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think there is, though|pg||
nt|athene: he can't quite manage to throw one diamond on the @SK and crossruff enough tricks|pg||
nt|idc: While there's a lull in the action: the second half of the current round of matches continues in 40 mins: 12:20 local time|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's interesting - suppose you go club ruff, @SK throwing diamond, spade ruff, diamond towards dummy|pg||
nt|athene: now if north has the @DK he can rise and play his trump but then the @DQ is good|pg||
nt|paulg:  he will eventually just lead the diamond|pg||
nt|athene: no, it still just needs the diamond right|pg||
nt|athene: because if south could win the @DK he would just play a club forcing dummy and promoting a trick for the @HJ|pg||

nt|rmb1: Oh.  Its a typo,  Schedule is 21:50|pg||
nt|toobad: a sad blow!!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg:  all the matches look pretty close at the moment, so all to play for in the second halves|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Last board up. Next segment start in 58 min. TKX for the inputs specs:) TKX also to the exelant vug operator:) I'm Frank from Norway 04.17 local time:)|pg||
nt|steveray: come on then Robin, what's this?|pg||
nt|toobad: horrible @H overcall in the open room - what a suit!|pg||
nt|rmb1: Jones the West's claims in 1NT are getting worse :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 4414 or |pg||
nt|rmb1: 4414 or 4405|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last board.  Thanks to commentators Mike, Justin and David.  Thanks to operator and organisers CBAI|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|justin c: 2@H 3 suited, short @D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|toobad: can we make 3nt?|pg||
nt|pfbr: oh, i do hope so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 10-16 (?)  card does not say|pg||
nt|steveray: see it was S in @s in other room:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: selway pulled a penalty double earler, will he do it again?|pg||
nt|steveray: we used to play that - light years ago, pick your poison, a 4-2 break and no points or a 5-1|pg||
nt|justin c: (like old precision 2@D)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: A new X?|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: 3@C any min|pg||
nt|rmb1: England retake the lead by avoiding slam on  30|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT not safe here|pg||
nt|justin c: @HJ lead, @D10 switch |pg||
nt|golfsquash: This will be a good gain for England|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: good lead|pg||
nt|toobad: when opps make that big a boo boo it should be punished|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks Geoff, great job :)|pg||
nt|athene: you build a trick for the @SJ to throw a club from dummy, maybe|pg||
pc|d2|nt|steveray: but this is not penalty - or is it?|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs predicting 5@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks John :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: tyHedy|pg||
nt|toobad: ditto|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mikeirl: A more effective|pg||
nt|justin c: correctly :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, although West comes under pressure on the trumps anyhow|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west has to guard all three side-suits, so he is in for a rough time|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy for declarer to place the high cards here :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  sime/matheson more forward in the bidding than their team mates, who would pass the West hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rmb1: He might make this one.  We may even get to see the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: lol|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|rodal f: I understand N. At OR S was in with 3@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|golfsquash: going down|pg||
nt|rmb1: Just ruff 3 @D in dummy|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|toobad: our thanks to all the specs for your comments|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rmb1: Not enough entries now|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: you are more inclined to pass the west hand at this vulnerability if playing a weak notrump i suppose|pg||
pc|c2|nt|toobad: should be a swing to the good guys |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|rmb1: On  11 West bid @H before North could, so NS stayed out of trouble and defended 3D-2 +9 to Ireland|pg||
nt|justin c: needed to play @D immediately i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont go far, we will be back for more fun soon!|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|toobad: easy now - overtricks - 10 or 11 in|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: draw trumps then do that would have left west endplayed|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|golfsquash: yes, had the chance|pg||
