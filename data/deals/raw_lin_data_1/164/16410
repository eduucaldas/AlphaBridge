nt|lestergold: Best's failure to bid 2n was extraordinary in my view|pg||
nt|greerm: if not all|pg||
nt|april7: an easy 4@H by EW|pg||

nt|april7: ACOL??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: looks like bergen|pg||
nt|greerm: ACOl, strong NT 5 card suits|pg||
nt|april7: yes, but 4card Major openings?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|greerm: including 5 card @D unless 4441 exactly|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: too good for 2@h and too good for premptive 3H thats the point of bergen i suppose|pg||
nt|april7: so why 1@H???|pg||

nt|mikeirl: welcome back|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello everyone!|pg||
nt|sybarra: David Greenwood, West is one of our fellow commentators |pg||
nt|pfbr: hi all|pg||
nt|toobad: 3nt by E/W here|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome|pg||
nt|toobad: preferable to 4 @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: good morning Sandie, Ralf, Paul|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Greetings!   :)|pg||
nt|pfbr: morning all :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Hi folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: Hi Jystin|pg||
nt|toobad: flat game in any event|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|milton_se: fit jump, it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|justin c: 4@h is where you want to be|pg||
nt|justin c: but not so easy to figure that out|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C = 11+ nat|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: err  is that right?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|milton_se: trumps 3-2, no drama|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 5@C cheaper than 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not if NS can find their @s ruff|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but this can go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Northern Ireland needs more "swingy" bds |pg||
pc|sK|nt|pfbr: swingy in their direction :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes indeed|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|rmb1: Sorry 2@C = clubs INV+ or other GF, 2@D relay|pg||
nt|justin c: i should have more faith|pg||
nt|mikeirl: S attack best|pg||
nt|justin c: imagined that N would try harder to play in @C|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|justin c: knows he is being forced if @H trumps, but the short hand taking the tap in @C|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Seems as a flatty. 120 tr|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10 tr|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the necessity of making one more trick for game may have influenced his thinking|pg||
nt|rmb1: Trumps 3-3 makes this easy in practice but not before some agonising|pg||

nt|april7: W will try a rebid of 1NT perhaps and N might bid his @D again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|greerm: 1@D or 2 by north?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|april7: could be that W will X 1 @H by S and E will bid @S, another possibility|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h by south in closed fine if that shows 5/4 in hearts and spades but very danfgerous bid otherwise however it pushed e/w overboard immediately|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|greerm: 18-19 points clearer for Mark this time, but no interest to partner|pg||
nt|april7: 3@D by N also ok|pg||
nt|april7: I mean 9 tricks in @D available, not bidding it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5 tricks looks all thats avaialble here for e/w as in closed room|pg||
pc|d6|nt|greerm: 1@D 1@C 1@H and 3@S possible though|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|greerm: N/S get their 8 too soon|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: not before n/e have earned 6 tricks surely with 5@d club and 2@h|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: 8 tricks i mean|pg||
nt|april7: but after S getsa 1 @H , should play @C and then 2 down|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|c7|pc|dJ|pg||

pc|d4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|greerm: in the cl;osed room, N/S play that a 2@H opener shows 4+ 4+ in majors, weak, hence the 2NT by west|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|h6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|greerm: I suppose we chalk that up as 2 imps to the system|pg||
nt|april7: which is a normal bid|pg||
mc|5|nt|lestergold: as i suspected|pg||
pg||

nt|yo_yo: i guess it's quick run through|pg||
nt|mikeirl: assume there was more to the bidding than recorded :)|pg||
nt|steveray: saves time opening with the best contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: both pairs play strong NT and 5 card majors|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thats one way of retaining trump control :)|pg||
nt|justin c: temporarily, anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rodal f: S for a opening? Y|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Have to avoid losing two spades in 4@H but defence may establish @CQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry just catching up|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ok|pg||
nt|steveray: hard to see this making|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  3NT is harder|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Feel NS are in trouble|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes. D lead shoul beat |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the end of 3NT then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would like the see the bidding, i cant understand why they arent in 4@H|pg||
nt|steveray: assuming East opened 1@C South should not take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c "natural", ostensibly 5+ clubs and a major or 6+ clubs with enough to open the bidding|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh boy ...................|pg||
nt|toobad: a bit frisky by S at the vulnerability..|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|dburn: but being in third position at favourable is enough to open the bidding nowadays|pg||
nt|mrt2000: trouble here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rmb1: 2@C = nat, limited (6+ or 5C+4M)|pg||
nt|sybarra: havent gotten to card yet, is is some form of flannery?  (I may get killed for mentioning that word) |pg||
nt|toobad: a @H lead ducked by S woud have been really unpleasant for declarer|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|milton_se: won't be happy |pg||
nt|pfbr: :(|pg||
nt|mrt2000: happier than if doubled!!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mrt2000: N must have seen his partner's overcalls before|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: E? Who have the rest of the pints?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Could have been a interestin 6@D if opp was 1-3 at @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for North to act with all but one of his points in opponents suits|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for South - best is probably not to shift to spades, but it looks an obvious defence to follow|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodal f: Second best|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzxa: N thinking...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on that lead, this may only go 1 off|pg||
nt|milton_se: he might have feared that 4S was playable|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: and down we go |pg||
pc|h5|pc|dJ|pg||

pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||

nt|milton_se: East may still think it's making :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s2|nt|dburn: well, he followed it - but declarer didn't have any diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: and this has helped him keep control of the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: to the extent that if he can guess hearts, he will actually make|pg||
nt|rmb1: or discard a heart and ensure -1|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not now  :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: 2 @H was both majors,  5-10 pts |pg||

nt|april7: W might open 1 @S and E 2@S, then W might make a trial bid then stay in 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand but e/ws 20 is more equal than n/souths|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|april7: this time W opens 1@C and the 4card major|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|lestergold: ht lead  provides ten tenth trick|pg||
mb|r|mb|3D|nt|april7: why should S lead @H???|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume that a@h was led in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north was on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: of course south would never lead a heart as he has an obvious club lead|pg||
nt|greerm: 1 off if the defence cash their @H tricks|pg||
nt|april7: 1 down only|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: providing e/w cash their hearts which i expect they will|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Interesting. Need @H lead for stop a 6er|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have one chance more|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: he might - the cards are fairly well disposed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: 2@S=force|pg||
nt|insia1: will they go to slam ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C allowing partner to judge what to do over 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hJ on side  in 6@c|pg||
nt|milton_se: there|pg||
nt|sybarra: anderson showing good judgement, as much as he would like to be in red game|pg||
pc|d3|nt|justin c: can subsequently promote @S10|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3@D showed a @H suit here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|steveray: but 5@H is cold on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rmb1: And NS judged to give up quietly ?|pg||
nt|justin c: if dec ducks trick 1, needs @h underlead later|pg||
nt|justin c: bit easier from where we are sitting|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@C to come|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: And the @C blowed away after the invit 3@D|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 10 or 11 tricks here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Hi Meddy:)|pg||
nt|steveray: North needs partner to play a club before the D@s are set up|pg||
nt|steveray: Diamonds that is|pg||
nt|dburn: one of these days, the English will lead trumps when declarer actually has some diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no great matter against a part score|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: well done erichsen|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: but will south lead @C?|pg||
nt|steveray: might the @D be a singleton?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: odds on to|pg||
nt|rmb1: North can afford to be passive, but this is the most direct approach.  Hopefully 4@C bid will reap its rewards now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might take his partner for a singleton @D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer would not allow @DK to win if he had the ace|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hopefully selway will work that out|pg||
nt|justin c: is the West hand not worth a strong @C opening?|pg||
nt|justin c: seen worse|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe they dont get to game even then|pg||
pc|s6|nt|insia1: good bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make S hand as main and nwxt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||

nt|egezzer: West is John Greenwood,Shirley?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pfbr: david greenwood|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: the strong variety of 1@c has a higher lower bound for Carrot players than for Precision players|pg||
pc|s7|nt|insia1: I think he will drop @C, after finess @D|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|pfbr: (JTR) on bbo|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rmb1: Temptation with 2-suiters is to open 1suit nat if possible to get your suits over quickly|pg||
nt|egezzer: Oh. Thank you Anita|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: Just what we would expect from the winners of the Premier league|pg||

nt|insia1: well, mantap|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|steveray: well done|pg||
pc|d2|mc|10|nt|dburn: and experience suggests that, especially when at unfavourable vulnerability, two-suiters should try to bid naturally rather than open a strong club|pg||

mb|1C|mb|d|nt|greerm: the fun intra finesse position in the @C suit|pg||

nt|april7: NOW OCOURSE ! 1h BY n|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|april7: 1@H by N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: very difficult to defend, could well be flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm after passing i think north nees to do something a little more vigorous like 2N|pg||
nt|greerm: especially with @C giving 3 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: and what about the @H suit??S could very well have 4 @H|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h should in my book shiow 5 hearts and fewere points and is suspect that is what south has taken him for|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|april7: and what do you do with 4@H and 9 Points?|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@C is a possibility for North instead of 2@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: maybe better even than 2N needs to show his maxi hand for his original pass|pg||

nt|rmb1: open room started at board 15, so we will see comparisons when they complete board 1, etc.|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite sure why he made only three|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps to reassure his partner that they had not missed a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: they're just starting Board 1 no|pg||
nt|mikeirl: *now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A coffe board to come it seems|pg||

nt|mikeirl: perhapsS |pg||
nt|steveray: S might try 3NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhaps S will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rmb1: OK. So 4@C= is par because 4MX-1 is 200|pg||
nt|mikeirl: snap!|pg||
nt|steveray: or will ask for a @S stop|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will NS get into the auction on this one? |pg||
nt|mrt2000: David must be getting bored  .......  :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only -1 in 5@c on board 1. Defence must have sipped|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of our fellow commentators with great analysis and even greater sense of humor (imo)|pg||
nt|pfbr: mine too :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rodal f: I would have opened at Ws hand. 1@S 110 by 100 times|pg||
nt|dburn: well, one of them will|pg||
nt|dburn: probably the one with the spades|pg||
nt|dburn: ah - the support double!|pg||
nt|dburn: now what on Earth, I wonder, is East supposed to do with that?|pg||
