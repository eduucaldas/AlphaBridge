mb|p|mb|1N|nt|chrisdixon:  There is a slam on for EW here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|chrisdixon:  But not biddable, I imagine|pg||
nt|jcmax: NO doubt S hopes his opponents will get to 3NT....|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|jcmax: Without that hope he surely would have bid something over 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@D now might do the trick?|pg||
nt|xenya: but no...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcmax: This is an important point to remember. When your opponent passes over 1NT and then comes in on the 3-level in a live auction, he probably has a solid suit!|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: but of course the slam is not all that good|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Good point|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, good point, Sabine|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Slam is quite good - clubs for 5 tricks or heart finesse|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Only a diamond lead to North and a heart switch makes it a problem|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: strong @C also for E/W|pg||
nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/hanlon-mcgann.pdf  EW system card|pg||
nt|garnetts: very interesting hand--who does it belong to?  |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|justin c: NS, in theory|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Actually 10 in clubs normally just mean that you donÂ´t like the suit, rare with Lavinthal in these positions in Sweden.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is interesting - SUCTION - one suit in @H or two suit @S@C|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@D = shortage|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/TeddSalisburyCC090918.pdf  NS system card|pg||
nt|rmb1: But are NS English or Welsh?|pg||
nt|justin c: let them bid a bit more :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW have nine tricks in spades and NS 11 in clubs --but not perhaps in hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: welcome to this all-ticket confrontation|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Walker is *thinking* in the other room Roland|pg||
nt|justin c: rehi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Website for Camrose resultsm running scores, and other info http://www.cbai.ie/|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfect fit here but still difficult to find slam|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|greerm: good evening, this is the first CAmrose cap for Willie Hamilton, brother of Ian, we wish him well|pg||
nt|garnetts: South did very well to start with 2@C|pg||
nt|rmb1: Much easier when your suits break 3-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have thought that the ability to show short @d might have excited Selway given his control reach no trump not to mention 5 spades|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: NS can make 3N pretty easily|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  pretty similar systems for both pairs, 5-card majors, strong 1NT and three weak 2s|pg||
nt|greerm: Willie has also represented Northern Ireland at fencing in I think the Commonwealth Games|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bridge_one: the lead J@S is a surprise holding QJ10987 in @H|pg||
nt|justin c: a @h and a @S to lose here|pg||
nt|justin c: who is winning this event lately?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|po-s: EW can sacrifice in 4D or S|pg||
nt|chick: If they think the 3N is making, yes :)|pg||
nt|justin c: saw WBU in the lead for a while yesterday|pg||
nt|justin c: If 3@S for East, which looks more normal, still not clear they would get there|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: dummy was a disappointment - |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: but South think to find a suit better that @H, because his K in @C is very bad after 3@C by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: at least there is no money involved |pg||
nt|odysseus69: with a banced 15 it is normal to bid 3NT over 3D - but sometimes it can lead to a big penalty though not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to find a discard from dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond looks best|pg||
nt|garnetts: would you have expressed an opinion about 3NT Victor ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i am too much of a coward - but you would be there David - what do you think about club king as alternative lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think it best for the usual reasons |pg||
nt|justin c: am told CBAI in the lead by 1 point|pg||

pc|s7|nt|chick: but would still be more for NS than this will be |pg||
nt|po-s: or think that 4S makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: they had the kit to reach slam and Erichsen used it but Selway opted for the conservative |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: the question is: the opps probably have 9 tricks - the lead @H try to beat the contract finding any good layout - the lead @S need to find more cards |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|garnetts: should have held this ace up too perhaps |pg||
pc|d5|pc|s9|pc|d4|pg||

N doubled, rebid 2N over 2@H and then 3N over partner's 3@D. Maybe he tought 3@D showed some values. Should it?|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  He should call it a day now|pg||
nt|jcmax: Didn't you say just a while before this pair doesn't like playing partials? :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chrisdixon:  I did - and  I was right although I think that is poorly judged|pg||
nt|xenya: confirmed|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chrisdixon:  Hard to see where 9 tricks will come from|pg||
nt|vugraphzxw: "Thanks very much" from Whittaker|pg||
nt|jcmax: Applying the rule of 11 S can safely win this trick with the 8 or 9 in dummy...|pg||
nt|dburn: this contract isn't actually much worse than @dQ falling|pg||
nt|xenya: true -- barring a club lead|pg||
nt|dburn: which is decent enough odds for a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcmax: Oh sry, it was E's lead!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|dburn: oh, sure - if East led a club when West had bid spades twice, the contract would be worse|pg||
nt|jcmax: Couldn't clubs be N's long suit on this auction?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|dburn: they could indeed - nobody really suspected that declarer's long suit was actually spades|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|d8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcmax: First they were content with bidding 2NT, but over 3@D they wanted to play in game.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: it's a murky sort of position that I doubt everyone has discussed|pg||

nt|chick: I look forward to seeing what happens at the other table :)|pg||
nt|justin c: would it not be better to invite another country to join in rather than have two teams from same place?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be exciting|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: could end up anywhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: plenty of disaster potential on thisn deal|pg||
nt|justin c: isnt there :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: yes, open weak NT :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially if n/s declare|pg||
nt|lestergold: now what do u bid with north's  monstrou8sn hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl|pg||
nt|justin c: double|pg||
mb|d|nt|rmb1: If they were to invite a team from the near continent (France/Netherlands) they would win :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: very difficult slam to reach|pg||
nt|lestergold: followd by no trumps i expect|pg||
nt|roswolf: the rebid is trickier|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: they are so aggressive that is possible to see 3@H now|pg||
nt|paulg:  normal high level bridge, three passes to you and then no-one passes before your next call|pg||
nt|chick: first they have to get into the bidding|pg||
nt|peachy: Second seat Vul maybe kept Salisbury from opening|pg||
nt|peachy: not unreasonable at all, when the suits are minors|pg||
nt|po-s: if he bids 3C I will leave|pg||
nt|peachy: heh PO|pg||
nt|justin c: isle of man suggested by two kibs|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not at all convinced by that %@C effort --do you think he thought he had no defence |pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@C |pg||
nt|justin c: tho judging by what i saw yesterday, they too might win|pg||
nt|justin c: this lacks aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has no choice|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@H-2NT-3@D perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might regret that|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now brown cow?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: 2@s does not play that badly north will be endplayed a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: I dont know much about the Welsh pair. They will do well to restrainIrelands leading pair|pg||
nt|garnetts: clear cut 3@D bid now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and then 3NT?|pg||
nt|chick: whew!!   we want po to stay!!|pg||
nt|garnetts: quite--why bid over 4@C ?  I think its a sort of reaction bid--failed to think first |pg||
nt|justin c: now 2NT i think|pg||
nt|justin c: and 3@D for S|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: All five of us!|pg||
nt|peachy: I am happy you can stay now po|pg||
nt|roswolf: disaster looms if south shows a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now will Tedd give up|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bridge_one: in money game DBL now for sure |pg||
nt|justin c: quality that counts Mark|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks, I maintain it is a difficult hand to find slam on|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: in IMP competition need to be more safe|pg||
nt|justin c: speaking of quality, this 3NT contract lacks it|pg||
nt|justin c: horrible contract, but neither N nor S can remotely put a red card on it|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nothing exceptional here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not clear cut is it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: he should be able to envisage the near yarborough opposite|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the guns ring out|pg||
mb|4D|nt|paulg:  3@c is a brave call as Sime was not guaranteed a fit (Matheson might hold five hearts for example)|pg||
nt|greerm: helpful lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  blame the 2@s bidder|pg||
nt|justin c: so i guess this will just drift several off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very respectful of partners balancing action|pg||
nt|garnetts: Probably done well to pass as 3NT needs the diamond finesse and thats certainly not clearcut |pg||
nt|garnetts: this contrcat needs the same view I suppose too|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am afraid that I would have overcalled with 2@S earlier |pg||
nt|po-s: even without an opening by West|pg||
nt|justin c: had a feeling this auciton would end with a red card from somebody|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: when the other 3 suits look dangerous too|pg||
nt|lestergold: he hasnt got the message but Selway comes to life and gives it to him|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: South will just cash three aces in a while--and if I were east i would be thinking of some acerbic comment |pg||
nt|rmb1: South cash out now!|pg||
nt|roswolf: who forgot to axe!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm prepared to double 3N with an A and a K but frightened to double 4@d holding 4 trumps to the Q|pg||
nt|lestergold: seems inconsistent to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: the welsh have escaped a nasty wound|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: I think we would all bid this the same way |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|garnetts: have to say a club looks so obvious I wouldn't even think about it |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I would like to be in 3NT - and maybe right to take the diamond finesse|pg||

nt|xenya: so ir says|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jcmax: This seems to be a set of no fits or suits breaking badly|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dburn: 2@h is natural and forcing for one round|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 2@c would be a puppet to 2@d, and could be followed by a game force|pg||
nt|jcmax: That is a very nice agreement when you have this N hand!|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@d would be invitational|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  This doesn't look easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzxw: B18 was -1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: that fits|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  He has to hope for one of the black suits to split|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chrisdixon:  The defence must take care not to allow declarer to get to a major suit squeeze position against West|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer did well to guess right in @H. He can easily come to 8 tricks now and maybe something "develops" for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|dburn: he might have done even better in hearts - the seven would have forced the king also, and left North with a tenace|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer is reluctant to pitch a @C now. He doesn't know that suit doesn't split 3-3....|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|nt|dburn: still, the ten was a normal play|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  He might duck this now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Now I think only a diamond to the Jack would beat it|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|c8|nt|dburn: maybe, but even the second round of clubs will give West an awkward discard|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  He could discard a diamond because East would have club winners|pg||
nt|dburn: but now he may just be able to clear the hearts, and later play a diamond to the king|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c9|pc|d9|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d7|pc|c6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|dburn: however, declarer may play for spades 3-3 rather than the diamond finesse - anti-percentage, but...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chrisdixon:  He will test the spades before cashing the heart|pg||
nt|dburn: he can play two rounds of spades ending in dummy and consider his options|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps even three rounds of spades ending on the table|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Win with the K@C, cash 3 spades and end up playing towards the K@D|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||

nt|garnetts: I had some antiquted idea that a busybody on some laws committee said you could not psyche your sides strong bid--perosnally I would make it compulsory |pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulg:  i'm not sure the Scottish East will bid 2@s, but West may push anyhow|pg||
nt|peachy: at least according to sys card, which was is it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Hallo all|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can find the convention cards for these pairs at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|diana1: hi all and welcome to the first match in this year's Camrose series - the home internationals|pg||
nt|sheila a: South's hand is pretty poor but NV she figured it was worth a pre-empt|pg||
nt|greerm: not a brilliant contract but...|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for anyone except Deep Finesse or GIB to find the @cK lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: south will show his shape nopw with 3@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he chose to show club guard i prefer 3@c as it serves same purpose but shows void heart|pg||
mb|3H|nt|garnetts: there is no lead that will do any good here--and a spade costs |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Lars Andersson|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S are playing strong @C or not ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 12 on spade lead- 11 on rest|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzxd: they are :)|pg||
nt|bt: thx roland, good to be here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 3@S now |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I know it is fashionable but I think the opening bid is dreadful |pg||
nt|justin c: no game for EW with the @SK wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: just forcing probably|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT showed max, either bal or with support|pg||
nt|rmb1: That regulation has been dropped (in England)|pg||
nt|justin c: ive never been clear on what qualifies as psyching your strong bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Let me be clear I would rather chew my own arm off than open with 3@D |pg||
nt|justin c: saw a 2@C opening yesterday on a solid @S suit and not a lot else|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hi Lars :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N by default as we may have predicted|pg||
pc|h6|nt|diablo666: Hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats a pretty well thought out sequence |pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk5: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
nt|po-s: I think he should appreciate his spade doubleton as extra trick value in a club contract|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 8 tricks easy but where is 9th coming from?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not convinced that heart was best lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bt: it seems skara is still winning, but 2 game swings will put it in jeopardy|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit busy on this misfit auction|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chessmaste: Nothing to the play - 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: Being declarer did have some value in protecting his two AQ holdings|pg||
pc|h8|nt|garnetts: wastes energy thinking here when you know its a spread |pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer spade passive|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|justin c: after 2@C-2@D-4@S, partner passed and put down an ace and a king etc|pg||
nt|rmb1: opening 2@C (strong, artificial) on South hand would be a psyche|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think we sort of disagreed on that lol --it was EW here that bid it |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: it has almost certainly kept EW low which is to their advantage |pg||
nt|justin c: potentially West being put in with the 4th @S to lead into the @HA7 at the end|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: However-- I would rather bid anyhting than 3@D --its sending a boy on a mans errand in spades |pg||
nt|lestergold: Tedd could now try to establish his long heart|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|po-s: I suppose declarer might have had 4135 with more points and worse clubs|pg||

nt|jcmax: The problem with bidding 3@D with the W hand is that you don't need much from partner to make 4@H, if he has a 5-card suit. But you may never discover the fit, because partner may ...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: What was the contract and result on 17, guys?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OK; done|pg||
nt|paulg:  we have seen a lot of two-suiters tonight, perhaps the theme of the weekend|pg||
nt|greerm: 3C+2 by Norht on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: ok we are back! lost the play on 19, sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: well played :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT for EW here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
nt|paulg:  the play on 19 would have been uninteresting, we can live without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: figured as much :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has a clear 3@S opening in my view these 6-4 hands usually play well and the spades are pretty good |pg||
nt|odysseus69: will South double 3 hearts?-|pg||
nt|justin c: nv against vul looks like a 5@D opening to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|1H|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he does willNort pass|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Acol and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|justin c: which might get a huge result if you find a @S lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I absolutely agree|pg||
nt|justin c: choice of games to play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes and about as difficult to make as the last one |pg||
mb|3D|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: If NS get to some number of no-trumps there is a classic intra finesse position in clubs |pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT by N maybe here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
nt|justin c: y indeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S or 3@S Victor?  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: double explained as promising 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets see if they can do it in defence |pg||
nt|justin c: close to 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: this will tell us |pg||
nt|odysseus69: the ultra conservative approach continues|pg||
nt|garnetts: I bet he would bid 4@H over 3@S |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: seems a simpel 1 off, anyone see anything lese?|pg||
nt|justin c: too early for difficult contracts|pg||
nt|justin c: off on a @C lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: 43/ spade game looks reasonable but 3N makes with the favourable position in the minors|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to me 5@D needs the @D finesse and nothing else|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Give us Man Utd|pg||
nt|bt: what are the chances of that roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Non-existent|pg||
nt|bt: seems board 23-24 are slightly favorable for skara|pg||
nt|bt: well skara is winning here so|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like 3S bur expected 2|pg||
nt|justin c: while 3NT needs a @C position also|pg||
nt|lestergold: east was bound to bid 3N with his q high holdings |pg||
pc|cA|nt|chessmaste: Looks like the same ten tricks too|pg||
nt|rmb1: X|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT  for running scores|pg||
nt|justin c: another double?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|diana1: very hard for Vi to imagine that Charles has also 3 losing @hs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: technically he should have passed 3@d but risks worth taking for vul game|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|justin c: S might have continued here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||
nt|garnetts: my current pet idea 6-4 with a reasonable six carder open three|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: For me yes--I would give it one more try |pg||
nt|justin c: if only to play 3@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: but this might make|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he knows where the king of clubs is so ak of hearts then ace of clubs|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|garnetts: North might just float it |pg||
pc|cK|nt|bt: the natural play works|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|diana1: so early on in the match she is probably going for what she thinks is the safest thing|pg||
nt|paulg:  all the reasons are there to make North declarer on this hand, but it just did not work here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that west should bid 1@D rather than pass--playing a system where 1@C can be short alolows you to respond on garbage when you have short clubs  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: oops- bad play|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer gets it right|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten tricks now|pg||

nt|greerm: but when dbl promises 3H, then he had a different decision|pg||
nt|justin c: did N think dec had another trump there?|pg||
nt|justin c: lets move on|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a routine 3NT making lots |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Dan Neill|pg||
nt|garnetts: The last hand dec had no choice but to get the spade right because he could count North's points--the ace of spades he would open |pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|justin c: hi Dan|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hello Dan |pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north was marked with KQJ of spades - the QJ of diamonds so could not have king of clubs. |pg||
nt|garnetts: true but then South could not have been suitably manipulated as he was |pg||
nt|odysseus69: wise not to double!!|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@H for NS|pg||
nt|justin c: nice @H position EW here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|garnetts: 4@S is cheap here |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like another 3N|pg||
mb|d|nt|justin c: agreed he should get the @S right|pg||
nt|rmb1: More on a non-spade lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: but very hard to find unless West bids |pg||
nt|justin c: @S lead stopping 6@H|pg||
mb|p!|nt|sheila a: This is the slight downside to the Multi, in that it's easier for E to come in over 2@d than 2@s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|greerm: 3NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: but the chances of doing so were dramatically improved by N endplaying S|pg||
nt|rmb1: Now it will be difficult to stop East|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|garnetts: this theme came up in the first set--do you guys think 1@S is best or 2@C?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Canape opening |pg||
nt|garnetts: interesting |pg||
nt|garnetts: Now no one will know who the hand belongs to --if North pre-empts |pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen has opted top make a cautious bid here but selway will bid again |pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: very true|pg||
nt|justin c: i think souths pass suggests playing in @D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: likely to finish in a partcsore --1NT or 2@S |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@C for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: not the greatest dummy but has chances|pg||
nt|greerm: in theory 4@C 2@S 2@D and 1@H |pg||
nt|greerm: can the defence chalenge that?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT should end it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3NT or 4@S here i think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@S is possible|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit I would have bid 4@S over 3@D --I think it is right to pressurise here |pg||
nt|garnetts: EW really missed a chnace in my view |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i don't think they can, but a few concerns for declarer|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  the upside is that West may not have a cue bid available|pg||
nt|garnetts: Norman did well to avoid 2@C |pg||
pc|d8|nt|greerm: he that hesitates is lost ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: strange auction on Board three in the OR  and they failed to double the final contract and still gained 5 imps |pg||
nt|odysseus69: The Irish South must have heard your tip David - he opened 3D with 6-4 on board 2 and picked up 5 imps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bt: we had an undo. makes more sense now. maybe there should be a bid for the west hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like 2@c as well|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I agree I much prefer 2@C |pg||
pc|d4|nt|justin c: for one thing, 2@C to be followed with 2@S is more economical than 1@S then 3@C, as here|pg||
nt|garnetts: he did--but I wouldn't bid it with a side major unless partner had passed laready |pg||
pc|dA|nt|justin c: which has helped N find the best lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: no choice here simple heart finesse for 9|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|justin c: intra the @S suit :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes I forgot we all overbid here nbecause we are such great card players these days |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will not be easy - at the very least needs an intra finesse in spades  |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think if partner bids one major have to use the other as a cue|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Always easy to overbid from the commentators seat|pg||
nt|garnetts: If plays the intra he likely looked --he will surely try and ruff a club and try ace and another spade|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I suspect he will struggle whatever he does|pg||
nt|lestergold: after discovering the bad news in clubs of  course|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|garnetts: He surely did not play the Q@H  |pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: yes :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A cunning fasle card Mr B. |pg||
nt|justin c: helping declarer to finesse the @H10 later|pg||
nt|garnetts: it was a bit windy not to double 4@C |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: maybe that is a better idea than helping partner--|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: 2@C by W would have been the winner, but perhaps that is not allowed by their system|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: He must be so glad he played that Q@H now |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bt: people usually dont work much on 1X-(1N)-?? in their system, pretty common auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|greerm: looks like defence can make it difficult but not quite difficult enough|pg||
nt|greerm: @C now only postpones it|pg||
nt|paulg:  a club now would force declarer to guess the layout|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: N/S have @D, greter that @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: and does show the five four shape you actually have--C plus S  not the other way round |pg||
pc|sK|nt|rmb1: OK 12 tricks on a non-spade lead was a bit double-dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: veer windy- partner opened 3D vulnerable in 2nd seat and it looked like 4 tricks in his own hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: he has to play a club --no option |pg||
nt|chessmaste: No reason to play the king here - unless you are on declarer's side|pg||
nt|garnetts: and it almost makes the intra finesse a possibility --just because of a false card--strange game |pg||

nt|vugraphzxw: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: did the table agree about that too?|pg||
nt|jcmax: The idea being that it doesn't give any information away. and indeed on this auctiona @D lead was much more likely than against 1N-3N|pg||

nt|justin c: south would blank the @HK rather than let himself get put in with the fourth @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we have a coffee break hand |pg||
mb|1N|nt|justin c: 3NT EW here|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like 4@H -1 if east opens |pg||
nt|peachy: regular weak two, imagine that :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes and it makes |pg||
mb|2C|nt|garnetts: the spade pips make 3NT the best game|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT or 5@C for NS here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Another easy game for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: at those colours north was rather likely to have one high card|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not tooo regular, bad suit, bad hand, first seat vul|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT here |pg||
nt|garnetts: The point about the last hand is that not evryone will bid 1@S and when he did--they should have reaped the rewards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  4@d splinter?|pg||
nt|justin c: 2NT 20-22|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no- probably 1 down regardless - i failed to spot club position|pg||
nt|peachy: Second seat vul would be worse, at least in first seat there are two opps to preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3@C 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|rmb1:  2 was flat in 5@CX-1 on the same auction: West raising with defence and little chance that 5@C was making|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sheila a: Not all weak NT players would open the E hand 1NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@c is a very wide-ranging call .. i think North will be a little nervous until dummy hits|pg||
nt|justin c: looking for 5-3 @H fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: well a club will be out of the question and if South makes a passive trump lead it won't make--attacks with a spade curtains too |pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: a spirited dbl by I H|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: trump looks normal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: another push board|pg||
nt|diana1: pity Burns didnt bid 2@c to show sme sort of a weak hand with majors as then Lindsay may have found a 3@s bid which does very nicely|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps H & H |pg||
nt|garnetts: that will not take any prisoners either |pg||
nt|garnetts: I quite like the 2@C bid--good psyche|pg||
nt|justin c: coffee time here|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C may be systemic: clubs or GF balanced, as some play; but its not on their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: as well as the distibution markibng south with 3 hearts 2 of mwhich he had discarded i admiot that it would have been good la to rapidly blamnk the K but it does not happen opften ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: in practice|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|justin c: 5 imps to England for playing 3@D instead of 3NT brd 2|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|garnetts:  I think 3NT after 3@D likely shows 4-4 majors and that leaves 3@H as a relay|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@h, i am told, denies 4@H but does not promise 4@S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bt: and if skara wins they qualify for the champions cup or whatever its called, i think|pg||
nt|justin c: make of that what you will :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  i expect this will be a swing .. nice redouble from Matheson|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sheila a: Yes, that would have worked better|pg||
nt|justin c: predictably enough|pg||
nt|garnetts: an old fashioned 3@C raise--it used to be a transfer to 3NT (:)) but in good style strongly suggests playing in the suit|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|djneill:  South was listening clearly|pg||
nt|odysseus69: do we know what 3C meant?|pg||
nt|garnetts: K@S is surely obvious--since you doscouraged with the six --then you know partner has only two :) |pg||
nt|odysseus69: presumably 2D was a game forcing relay|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am reasonably sure it means clubs --|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bt: eerily similar to fc copenhagen|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looks as if 3@C showed a @D suit to me |pg||
pc|c3|nt|bt: lol|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: and neither does South |pg||
nt|garnetts: waste of an excellent lead |pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|diana1: I know that with David I use Stayman to show either a weak hand with both majors or an invitational one (+ strong types obviously)|pg||

nt|justin c: another flat game....|pg||
nt|garnetts: annoying hand since he could have led any card and it would make no difference |pg||
nt|garnetts: Thats my kind of lead problem though |pg||
nt|odysseus69: late miscount|pg||
nt|rmb1: England captain says "natural or some balanced game force I think"|pg||
nt|lestergold: another combined 25 count bidding comp hand|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H here|pg||
nt|justin c: but not 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time there is a makeabkle game|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: so it wouldnt surprise me if the other E/W pair find their @s fit on that last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  West removing socks to count points|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the other room they're playing strong NT so would open 1@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: most of world are opening balanced 11s (not me or Maddocks)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bt: this is the type of slam you want to be in when it makes|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure about declarer's line though -- playing on spades rather than clubs looked better|pg||
nt|justin c: not a lot of imps going to move around on these first boards|pg||
nt|garnetts: true- nothing to say is there?  |pg||
nt|justin c: possible 4@S here|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT likely ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@C good  --possible 4@S   but not 3NT |pg||
nt|lestergold: will do well to reach the 5/2 heart fit game|pg||
nt|justin c: when West bids @H and @C, think East might get them to the right game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: i thought this was the 1@S = i have 13 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S suction - so one suit hand in @C or two suit @D+@H|pg||
nt|justin c: East hearing a lot of bidding, considering his hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I would bid that now |pg||
mb|2D|nt|justin c: if I think of anything, will let you know|pg||
nt|djneill:  short and to the point|pg||
nt|garnetts: Me neither Victor--I spend my life on here moaning about it --don't care what you do in third seat but dreadful in 1 and 2 |pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant understand 1 heart|pg||
nt|justin c: this was a @H partscore for NS|pg||
nt|justin c: great cards in his partner's suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: kinda both hands actually|pg||
nt|paulg:  and a weak 5-6 hand with a void in partner's suit is probably not what you were looking for, but things will improve|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: NS clearly keep 1@D to show at least four--so 1@C maybe tow|pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ot strong neuf to rebid his clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: east m,ay probe now with 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: @C and @D+@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2NT shows 22-23 balanced|pg||
nt|sheila a: N couldn't be blamed for leading a @h against 3NT, which won't be a great success|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: back to my usual comments about opening bad 11 counts |pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe they play Drury- if so North would be troubled- but ok|pg||
nt|garnetts: not much I do understand about the bidding these days --but if 3@D is a splinter they have done well |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I am getting too old --I have never liked drury much either |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  could be blamed now :)|pg||
nt|diana1: yes probably or else he is upgrading his hand and showing the normal 23-24|pg||
nt|lestergold: no selway has shown excellent judgment |pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: what is 3NT supposed to mean?   3@S I get but 3NT?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5 clubs now enough|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe thinking about 4 clubs but not a good idea|pg||
nt|odysseus69: partner marked with 4-4-1-4 now|pg||
nt|garnetts: what is 3NT then?  Am I being stupid?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: i thinh- only 4 hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|greerm: 6-5 come alive |pg||
nt|garnetts: No need to play a 4-3 fit--why risk it |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg:  2NT is a minor pre-empt, so they may play some form of kokish|pg||
nt|djneill:  David are you saying that East can use the information from the opening now to find the big honors?|pg||
nt|justin c: 9 imps to wales for making 3NT on brd 20|pg||
nt|justin c: intra finesse in @C, as predicted|pg||
nt|justin c: (east doubled the opening bid, making that the indicated line)|pg||
nt|garnetts: partly yes--also it makes life hard for partner knowing when to compete--and also leads to too many abd contracts |pg||
nt|garnetts: no objection in third seat though |pg||
nt|justin c: certainly reassuring on this board to know the @HA is in S, so you have an entry for @S tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: there was an earlier hand where North had a nine count after partner opened but did not compete on board 19 |pg||
nt|peachy: this lead COULD have been brilliant on another layout|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: 4@S with A A and Q of trump is conservative|pg||
nt|bt: y i agree, was a sweet hand|pg||
nt|diana1: yes I think they do|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Vi knows this is from 3 she can duck|pg||
nt|garnetts: I see what you mean--3@S shows maybe five hearts and 3NT  4-4-4-1   nice |pg||
pc|h8|nt|odysseus69: trump lead would solve all|pg||
nt|garnetts: the lead isn't exactly damaging is it |pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  still only four tricks for the defence ... really need to lead both blacks suits to trick one|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think South can consider many things here, it is hard to know which is best|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course AQ is very adequare support opposie rebid hearts|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bt: i assume west didnt splinter because of @CA singelton, and east then assumed no shortness, thats the only explanation for 4@S on such a prime hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  and, naturally, continue both blacks suits when in with the diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: well a @D was |pg||
nt|garnetts: it would have inconvienced east --make him need to get hearts right I think |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: EW using reverse attitude|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg:  it's clearly a very good hand when partner shows four in one of your suits|pg||
pc|hK|nt|justin c: this is where the auction helps him|pg||

pc|d5|nt|odysseus69: either red suit for 9 tricks -club for 10|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@D distinctly unswashbuckling|pg||
nt|dagold: down 3 is the target|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|paulg:  thinking that North has a balanced 11-13, then he probably thought he could|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dagold: usually 1@C then 2@C is not a light opener. I think 3@C is moderately normal|pg||

nt|garnetts: looks like it but will South bid 2@S ?   Then should east dbl or bid 3@C ?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: they also opened 1H on 4-4-1-4 in open room but there South responded 1NT to conclude bidding - still cant understand 1 heart|pg||

nt|paulg:  West about to bid an invitational 4NT?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT or 4@H ?  |pg||

mb|2N|nt|justin c: so i guess 1@C-3@C is something truly awful|pg||
nt|garnetts: why the second double--3@C better isn't it?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: double looks a bad idea - why not 3C|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: spec tells me 1NT was 15-17|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like to get in and out quickly with this hand type--3@C makes them find fit at that level 21D might let them in more easily |pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  2@c was 5-card stayman|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with Mark 3NT looks like a good shot now |pg||

nt|garnetts: six solid and a rag outside |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will westr lead a spade now?|pg||
nt|justin c: could even ruff out the @SA, but the entry position awkward for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: stretcher please??|pg||
nt|justin c: making now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sheila a: The Outreds routinely open light so Vi has to invite with her 12 count|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All over for the defence now|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: it looks as if McGann has overbid his cards and Hanlon may raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: playing 3Nt instead 4Nt is a advantage|pg||
nt|greerm: out alive :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice auction from West ... this must show some slam interest with no diamond control|pg||
nt|justin c: grab this, pitch a @S on the @CA, and pull trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he knows his partner|pg||
nt|garnetts: To me this looks like a very strong sequence by East--the second double and then 4@C  |pg||
nt|garnetts: I am wondering why anyone would rebid 1NT--when you have a perfactly good rebid in hearts available|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: this looks difficult|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  4, East opened 3@C not 1@C and the 4441 20HCP South hand could not go plus.  4@D-1.  5IMP to WBU|pg||
nt|dagold: moderately normal= middle of the road, normal for some not for all|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@S showed 4/4M exactly|pg||
nt|dagold: with 4/% he would bid 3@H|pg||
nt|dagold: 4/5|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean|pg||
nt|dagold: allowing Espen to bid 3@S if he had 4 of them|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bt: can discard a sapde and a club, what next|pg||
nt|diana1: they are obviously playing transfer responses to 1@c here and the 1@s bid denies 3@hs |pg||
nt|paulg:  not so obvious I'm afraid|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@ss rather|pg||
nt|justin c: there are preemptive raises, and preemptive raises|pg||
nt|justin c: not a bad idea to give p a clue what is happening|pg||
nt|justin c: for instance, he has 18-19 bal, and needs to know whether to bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs asking - 1@C showed 3+ @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: true--if he has then bid it in my view--having all this extra system burdens the mind for the play and serves leiitel useful purpose |pg||

nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: toilet break|pg||
nt|djneill:  West can put East with the @dA and a @h honor, but that's it|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe @sJ or @cQ if lucky|pg||
nt|justin c: @H10 i think|pg||
nt|justin c: planning on forcing the S hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  @h would kill a red squeeze against East in some situations (@hA is communication)|pg||
nt|justin c: playing in @H, can isolate the @S threat, but not here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  1@h shows any 12+ and 1@s shows 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|diana1: I know that David and Rex in the other room do |pg||
nt|paulg:  then 2@h is a transfer to spades followed by invitational 2NT|pg||
nt|diana1: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: some work needed here|pg||
nt|paulg:  this would not be a good hand for lead of 10 showing 0 or 2 higher honours|pg||
nt|lestergold: this looks ,lioke it gives an extra trick but its still 9 tricks on any lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bt: spade|pg||
nt|garnetts: here endeth the squeeze |pg||
nt|rmb1: If South played @D7 would East find the 8?|pg||
nt|garnetts: west can now take care of the diamonds --the J@D was a little naive as no one would really lead from a Q against 6NT |pg||
nt|rmb1: ... and declarer could always postpone @D finesse|pg||
nt|justin c: needed to win @DK keeping @DJ in dummy, then cross in @C and play @S off|pg||
nt|justin c: W must duck it|pg||
nt|rmb1: I hate to say this (again) but isn't declare thinking a trick too late|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|toobad: 3h denies a d control|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|rmb1: tempting to duck to not rectify the count|pg||
nt|justin c: then cash many winners, and endplay West or drop the @DQ, depending on his choice of discard|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  okay, even better|pg||
nt|justin c: this needs him to read the position in the ending, but if the @D2 was 4th highest, should get it right|pg||
nt|dagold: only if they cash out|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: aK of clubs and then hearts?  |pg||
nt|dagold: which is tricky|pg||
nt|lestergold: providing of ocurse n/s cash their @ds now|pg||
nt|lestergold: whioch is not obvious|pg||
nt|dagold: if south had the diamond T a diamond switch would even beat it|pg||
nt|dagold: so he probably should|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing much else to try for|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tedd cant be certain of the urgency here|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like 3@H tricks|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@C|pg||
nt|dagold: tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: now 4 @D are good for N/S|pg||

nt|lestergold: well he has found it|pg||

mb|1S|nt|garnetts: needs care on a spade lead |pg||

mb|2S|nt|garnetts: I know--but it would have been a good time to try 1@H wouldn't it?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose that East was limited on last since he didnt open 1 club|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats true but it wasn't our system |pg||
nt|peachy: 11.5-14 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is play for 4@s as cards lie but i think part score will be all here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: It did not occur to me that North might double |pg||

nt|jcmax: The common treatment is that any direct bid over redouble shows a weak hand. so with a weak hand and a good long suit one should really jump to 3@S instead of just biddng 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: perhaps he thought 2@S was forcing|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|xenya: redouble promising another bid|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: heart-club squeeze for 11 tricks, perhaps|pg||

nt|diablo666: Hi|pg||
nt|djneill:  other table East bid 2@s vulnerable, whew|pg||
nt|garnetts: brave bid--and got rewarded |pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S only here|pg||
nt|garnetts: THis type of hand could be dealt with by opening 2@C and rebidding 4@S maybe |pg||
nt|garnetts: nasty  hand for NS |pg||
nt|dagold: looks normal to my eyes|pg||
nt|lestergold: even i bid it|pg||
nt|justin c: just me then :)|pg||
nt|justin c: open 4@s maybe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: Hi Roger - do u know where find the CC of players ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxd: N-S is playing 1@C 16+, 1@D natural, 5c M, 2@D multi, 2M = 10-13 6+|pg||
nt|greerm: 3NT by NS now|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Another easy game here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would be pretty annoyed giving away 150 for no reason |pg||
mb|d|nt|diablo666: Nope, sry. Staffan will check it out...|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c shows diamonds, or a 5-card major with 4-card minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  they have been very solid since the accident on  22, probably give them confidence for the rest of the weekend|pg||
nt|chick: I'm not sure that S should have "super" accepted ... that @DK wasn't carrying it's weight and that left S with a measly 12|pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16|pg||
nt|dagold: I like 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer 4@s i must admit|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would have giot e/winto trouble|pg||
mb|r|nt|sheila a: not the world's best 4 card minor|pg||
nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  there could be blood if East doubles|pg||
nt|sheila a: Lindsay may be wondering if partner has @s|pg||
nt|garnetts: If I had been west it would have been 400 |pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont expect too much action by N/S|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will North bid?  They have been quite conservative.|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: or 4@H maybe|pg||
nt|garnetts: unless some oficious busybody tells me its not allowed these days |pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT 15-17|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to pass 4@s with west'shand|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|justin c: if W doubles that, you are in business|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: ty staffan|pg||
nt|justin c: Erichsen agrees with you, anyway|pg||
nt|justin c: we will find out if Selway does presently|pg||
nt|garnetts: so it appears --I am humbled :)  |pg||
nt|djneill:  Selway related to Soloway?|pg||
nt|justin c: easy to reflect with that N hand that you have a trick or two for a partner who can make 4@S without your help|pg||
nt|chick: I count a lot of losers here|pg||
nt|peachy: this cant make|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|dagold: North can redouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: now west has brought his goods to market at a low safe level no takers no trouble|pg||
nt|dagold: they may even miss game here|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has a perfect pressure preempt of 4@s|pg||
nt|dagold: if North thinks south is very weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  wow, that is a big pass by East|pg||
nt|sheila a: I guess most would play x as pass or correct by E in this situation?|pg||
nt|diana1: it really is - has to do something|pg||
nt|chick: 4 clubs, 2 hearts, maybe a diamond, and maybe a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Chris Dixon|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think double would be for takeout so Selway was stuck |pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Good morning all|pg||
nt|justin c: hi chris|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning Chris|pg||
nt|rmb1: Morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 2NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: takeout double here, will lead to 4@H by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: good barrage by NS |pg||
nt|garnetts: well does east absolutely promise four hearts?  I think not |pg||
nt|justin c: this 2@S should show a much weaker hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is feeble|pg||
pc|hK|nt|djneill:  West is feeling not bad about setting chances, for a little bit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|greerm: that might deny 2@H in which case N will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes in these auctions someone just has to bid notrump even with Jxx|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: looks like he needs hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: good for england not that im biassed|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many pair use the open of 4@C, in first and second position, with long suit in ! closed and A or K out - here the advantage to play natural|pg||
nt|justin c: far be it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|greerm: i meant bid 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: same hand a heart less and spade more--what would you do?  |pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  this is unlikely to take long|pg||
nt|justin c: @h can still be right in 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good point - double cannot guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: with short @H hand taking the @S force|pg||
nt|justin c: agreed, X covers a lot of ground|pg||
nt|justin c: not a lot else East can do with quite a lot of hands here|pg||
nt|dagold: not for the beauty of the game though!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: long suit in @H|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|justin c: personally, I am not wild about opening 2@C on hands like this|pg||
nt|djneill:  and there it went|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|chick: he can set up some hearts, but meanwhile the spades are going to be established for the defense, too|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: note the force of intermediate cards in the trump suit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|diana1: double is probably the best thing as he is happy enough if his partner passes or bids spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might not make either --needs accurate play |pg||
nt|justin c: both of Easts @H go no|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|justin c: i think you need defensive strength too|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  given the carnage that may ensue, this is probably the safest spot for EW|pg||
nt|garnetts: unlucky if you venture into the five level |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|djneill:  best defense is a good offense, so South has a lot of defense|pg||
nt|rmb1: No double - no trouble - just dript off|pg||
nt|lestergold: inexplicable to me at thism level|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chessmaste: The 4-1 heart break is a blow for declarer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He must now change tack |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sheila a: maybe he was worried that he had insufficient defence if partner was quite weak??|pg||
nt|justin c: outvoted as usual :)|pg||
nt|justin c: problem one, north has no idea when he should bid on over 4@S here|pg||
nt|rmb1: - *drift* off|pg||
nt|lestergold: the man has 7 tricks in his own hand qan hism partner redoubled |pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: The late John Collins first used this idea--and i thought he was right when I first saw it and still do |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|justin c: i think norths pass was fair enough|pg||
pc|s8|nt|garnetts: that will mean he gets the @D length right though--so a @D to the K --simply play the k@D first then lead towards  the ace |pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  except opponents are already limited, so can easily be your hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is on track now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Liggins can ruff or not as won't matter now --Mortons Fork |pg||
nt|garnetts: drink the water and die or don't drink the water and die |pg||
nt|dagold: I agree|pg||
nt|justin c: wasnt expecting this hand for S|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes south's fault|pg||
pc|s6|nt|justin c: problem two, with this 8=3=1=1 hand, it would be no surprise if 5m form the oppo came back to you|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chrisdixon:  A spade lead will be bad for the defence - but not fatal|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: this doesnt look too healthy|pg||
nt|dagold: no but Espen had to try it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|justin c: nothing v appealing for W to do|pg||
pc|s9|nt|garnetts: Just out of curiosity waht would an initial 3@S show?  |pg||
nt|djneill:  true|pg||
nt|peachy: well, he has it set in his own hand but only 1 trick|pg||
nt|peachy: by one trick|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, and vul with a hand like that, I'd want to be declaring|pg||
nt|peachy: I have to admit I would have started describing my hand|pg||
nt|justin c: seems kind of inevitable, doesnt it|pg||
nt|lestergold: im nopt sure of e/wbidding system ie as to their minimum requirements for a 2/1 response|pg||
nt|dagold: their 2/1 is FG unless the suit is rebid|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean he may expect mopre than  7 points opposite??|pg||
pc|s2|nt|justin c: presumably a stronger hand than this|pg||
nt|garnetts: well actually the sequence 2@C 2@D 3@d is always difficult |pg||
nt|justin c: it is|pg||
nt|justin c: for many, this denies a M|pg||
nt|djneill:  East was not expecting to play this one|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|diablo666: West showing extra values with no short suit, a bid that shows a positive attitude towards life :) .|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only 1 key cards in East, perhaps better 4@S over 3@D (but i don't know what means 3@D, could be conventional bid)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I am not sure a simple 2@S is right on the East hand - maybe 3@S - unless they think that is weak|pg||
nt|garnetts: or weaker?  |pg||
nt|justin c: (using 2@C-2@D-3M as 4M and longer @D)|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen hoping for the Jacf of clubs or a side entry. Norman hoping for a couple of clubs oppisite|pg||
nt|justin c: if E could have an 11 count and bid the same way, seems tough for W to know what to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c so if its rebid the hand can be as weak as this?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|greerm: standard lead with 5 trumps |pg||
nt|chick: this should make, draw trump, ruff the 3rd heart, then pitch diamonds on hearts, ruff the 3rd diamond|pg||
pc|cA|nt|justin c: hope to drop the @CJ10|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with Mark here--I like 3@S to be this hand type--no point in pre-empting with 3@S |pg||
nt|justin c: i dont know the EW bidding methods here|pg||
nt|justin c: but i think that 3@S would be a strong 1 suiter|pg||
nt|justin c: question is whether this is 'strong'|pg||
nt|justin c: it is if your p promises to produce the @SK and an A|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The other question you need to ask is if I bid 2@S will partner pass on many hands where we have a play for game?|pg||
nt|justin c: y, was wondering what, if anything, West would do if S had passed|pg||
nt|justin c: of the first 7 boards, 6 were flat|pg||
nt|justin c: slam decent here for EW|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: 3@D 14/15 no shortness (this inf., by kibitz, so TY :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yup--that is why I do not like 2@S |pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: only small hope|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Whenever West has modest spades he will be likley to pass, even with decent high card strength.|pg||
nt|garnetts: There was a case for a penalty double of 3@H --but usually you cannot do that as west |pg||
nt|chick: only works because trumps split|pg||
nt|justin c: dont think he will be too bothered by this - surely flat board|pg||
nt|justin c: until i said that it was, anyway|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chessmaste: That is why I would be inclined to overcall 3@S - then partner does not have to worry so much about trump support|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean it means somehting else like a game try in spades |pg||
nt|dagold: AK to seven and a stiff spade I'd rather overbid with 2@c than bid 1N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: that was needed --good switch |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dagold: if you hit a fit the hand is very good|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|diana1: it will be interesting to see what happens on Board 8 in the other room|pg||

nt|justin c: one way or another, this one ends up at the 5 level i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: would either of you be tempted to open 1@s?|pg||
nt|justin c: (available from all good bookshops :) )|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: South has a fine multi--North does not--an offensive weapon should not have two cast iron defensive tricks --and also the three cards in spades is an issue |pg||
nt|garnetts: swing to Wales here|pg||
nt|peachy: UNbalanced, sorry|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have never understood the 1@D opening on this hand type--why not 1@C ?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  against my religion to open 1@s|pg||
nt|garnetts: For what it is worth I would have bid 3@H as east |pg||
nt|bigtrain: hand was making if he wins the 2nd @H and pulls trump...  the 4th round endplays S|pg||
nt|lestergold: commentator's curse has got u Justin|pg||
nt|justin c: one day i will guess something that actually happens :)|pg||
nt|dagold: noone had a 5-level call really though|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i did once back before the old queen died|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually this was fairly predictable|pg||
pc|h7|nt|justin c: this mysterious multi is going to cost 800 odd|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This looks like 800|pg||

nt|garnetts: And do you know what --it serves him right |pg||
pc|h8|nt|chrisdixon:  I agree - North would not be well placed after a 2@D preference after 1@S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|diana1: I probably wouldnt - dont like to distort these hands - but neither would I bid 2@s over 1NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose that's what religion is for - to help you resist temptation :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: If we gave him a seventh heart he would not have opened 3@H with two aces would he.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|djneill:  if @s 3-0, can play loser on loser in @h, so just need one @d ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever nprth chooses to open 1@s or 3@s south would have raised to 4 not really worrying whetehr or not it was making|pg||
nt|dagold: club needed now and Espen's second heart|pg||
nt|dagold: asked for that|pg||
nt|dagold: the lower of the two remaining cards|pg||

nt|sheila a: I see Scotland failed to make 4@s on board 8 so it's a gain to Northern Ireland|pg||
nt|diana1: so Board 8 where Charles went one off in 4@h their other pair went one off in 4@s|pg||
nt|greerm: yet another 2 suiter|pg||
nt|paulg:  3 of them!|pg||
nt|greerm: squared|pg||
nt|justin c: possible 3NT for EW, but not easy to get there|pg||

nt|djneill:  East 1@d?|pg||
nt|justin c: sick|pg||
nt|garnetts: it can be beaten on a spade lead or A@D and a switch |pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  NS can make 7@h but you do not wnat to be in it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be expensive|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen's heart carding clearly asked for a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: so a small double swing|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play light initial actions but this too light for even them|pg||

nt|dagold: I don't agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it was here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and ive seenit before|pg||
nt|dagold: I think that was an unusual error for that type of situation|pg||
mb|1N|nt|greerm: who will get his spake in first?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  smallest possible|pg||

mb|2C|nt|djneill:  everyone was sick they passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: oh dear|pg||
mb|2S|nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|greerm: West is pretty powerful now|pg||
nt|greerm: needs little but needs exact cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless his partner has the @dA, would need to discard partner's hearts on his clubs|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2NT without a stopper is ambitious|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also agree with 2NT--even though it might well not work out well here|pg||
nt|justin c: hard to like double with the south cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|greerm: now Ian must guess that his void isn't working|pg||
nt|toobad: hard not to make a try|pg||
nt|justin c: @S ruff beats 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisdixon:  EW hands fit well here and it looks as if 10 tricks might be made - although a clubb lead and spade switch would defeat game|pg||
nt|justin c: but game not at all bad lookings at the EW cards alone|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: Many ways to raise hearts in this hand, I would have chosen a more descriptive one, either splinter or bid 1S to look for doublefit|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: maybe 3@H says I do not have a real stop --they can then grope |pg||
nt|garnetts: I have played that myself |pg||
nt|justin c: even after an indecently thorough grope, nowhere to go|pg||
nt|garnetts: it does--but NS were wise to let this one go--a spade lead or switch is essential |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  this looks very normal and the fortunate spade and club positions means that it will always make|pg||
nt|greerm: 5@C is 0/3 I presume|pg||
nt|garnetts: west might not lead a heart--but he shoudl because he has nothing else much |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and the fortunate diamond position|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  I am surprised that Mike Tedd remained silent throughout here|pg||
nt|justin c: according to the card, 1NT is "11.5 to 13.5 in principle"|pg||
nt|justin c: make of that what you will|pg||
pc|d4|nt|diana1: so this lead lets him get rid of his @s loser|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I expect it will be flat across the event|pg||
nt|diana1: yes probably|pg||
nt|paulg:  the North hand has no entry to cash the spade|pg||
nt|toobad: yes|pg||
nt|greerm: key lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: not the best sequence of bids I have ever seen |pg||
nt|lestergold: helpful lead no problems here |pg||
pc|d8|nt|greerm: off now, i think ok on any other lead but suppose @HK natural|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: but likely to make |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play 3@c as a mini splinter|pg||
nt|dagold: on the second heart, with 2 remaining the top card is the normal play as it is standard remaining count. the lower card is a strong message about the lower ranking suit|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: can afford to give up 2 clubs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|justin c: suppose he might double 2@H on the way out|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes and I am also suprised that South did not try 3@C in the pass out seat |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  considering that the hands are quite exciting and interesting, the imp score is very low|pg||
nt|garnetts: you might settle for 3@S --an intial double is not a panacea|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|chrisdixon:  He was not in the pass out seat|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dagold: so the higher card is neutral or asking for higher|pg||
nt|justin c: @D now, dec clears @C, another @D|pg||
nt|justin c: 1 off|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: if east hekld both clubs and west the spade holding as dealt then contract would be under threat|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dagold: can be important to have a neutral carding order so that partner does not think you are signalling something everytime you follow suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: a smooth duck was needed |pg||
nt|garnetts: thats why then :) |pg||
nt|garnetts: teach me to multi task |pg||
nt|rmb1: On  9 England avoided slam +11IMP|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: but u cant cater for everything|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: ok, they didn't have splinter available, as minisplinter less points, and 4C would have shown void|pg||
nt|peachy: is that correct Julian|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c2|nt|greerm: Needs a revoke now|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|paulg:  @hK natural but diamond lead could have been the killer|pg||
mc|10|nt|sheila a: I was just checking the play in 4@S on board 8. West had no entry so @s had to be played from the big hand|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|jcmax: I am being asked whether it would be wrong to open 1@D with the S hand.|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  This contract is closer than it looks|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|jcmax: That would be very aggressive in my view with a horrible 11 count and more than half the values in the short suits|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  certainly 9 tricks by ruffing the 3rd round of hearts with the Q@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcmax: Can't W overruff and play @SA and another @S then?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Hard to see a game opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: Looks to me declarer still has to lose 3@S 1@H and 1 @D trick|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Yes, but that gives 4 tricks in spades, 2 in hearts, and 3 in the minors|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: the trouble is that he has a diamond loser|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||

nt|xenya: correct to ruff with the Q here|pg||
nt|jcmax: In a way it was lucky for declarer that trumps are 5-0. If they are 4-1 instead a trump lead would surely have made it impossible to get to even 9 tricks|pg||

nt|justin c: he could make that by making first @C play from dummy, but on actual line was beatable|pg||
nt|lestergold: how?|pg||
nt|justin c: West has likes his chances of beating 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  solid opener from Vi Outred that shows a limited hand with either clubs or diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: are you thinking of 1@d, Paul?|pg||

nt|paulg:  i don't think Matheson and Sime will bid the slam|pg||
nt|toobad: it would be a stretch |pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16|pg||
nt|rmb1: On previous form South will not open 4@C as Crouch did|pg||

mb|1S|nt|paulg:  even more solid then|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@S anyone?|pg||
nt|paulg:  3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|toobad: fit jump?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|paulg:  2@s showing a 3-card limit raise is very popular with the 5-card majorites here|pg||
nt|garnetts: we do try to argue for leads we really would make and not just those that work when we can see all of the hands |pg||
nt|garnetts: should be totally flat in 4@S |pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  AN inspired defence would beat 4@H here|pg||

nt|rmb1: If South doubled would that be lightner|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: potentially @S ruff, @C underlead, @S ruff, @D|pg||

nt|dagold: might get 300 if north passes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|justin c: 2@H, just @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@C appears to mean I have a long suit somewhere |pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  QUite likely after a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: the auction does kind of suggest @h are 4-4|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless 1@d was a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: 1@d might have been a sort of responsive double|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, or just denying a 5-card major?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Vi wondering if there are 9 on top|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd be wondering if there are 7 on top|pg||
nt|sheila a: Charles has bid quite strongly but clearly there were other, stronger bids he could have made|pg||
nt|diana1: as you said before Paul it is easy when we can see all 4 hands|pg||

nt|lestergold: wales have achance to recoup a few imps|pg||

nt|dagold: must have done for north to bid 3@s|pg||

nt|lestergold: support doubke perhaps on first round?|pg||
nt|lestergold: in efect|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps but that is an unusual agreement|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think first double should show spade support|pg||
nt|justin c: i would have thought X was values, penalty oriented|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: @S leads here?|pg||
nt|justin c: (3@H with game invitation in @S perhaps)|pg||
nt|dagold: depends on how you agree it|pg||

nt|justin c: they seem to be on the same page, anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: second double was pneal;ties sure|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  a lot depends on what the redouble showed .. it may have been diamonds or a range|pg||

nt|chick: Hi Frank :)|pg||

pc|d9|nt|justin c: was about to say that they can get two @S ruffs|pg||
nt|justin c: more imps to England for reaching 4@S where S had 7 solid|pg||
nt|lestergold: on bidding he should have expected at least 4/1 break withc 5/0 a possibility|pg||
nt|justin c: Liggins opened that hand at the 1 level, as here, but then rebid 3@S, which got the job done|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|chrisdixon:  NS have an easy game in 5@D here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chrisdixon:  But they may play 3NT which is harder|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcmax: 3NT is the kind of bid one doesn't love with only 1 @H-stopper, but one does it all the time anyway!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: still makeable i think|pg||
nt|xenya: at first sight|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  If declarer takes the 1st @H and plays to develop a spade trick|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  The contract can be defeated by a sparkling defence of West switching to the Q@C|pg||
nt|jcmax: That would be such a great play!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|xenya: can be beaten it seems|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  East can continue with the 8@H as a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|jcmax: How should one play this contract? Is the best chance to play E for a doubleton @S honor?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|s3|nt|jcmax: That is in any case the layout where the contract never can be beaten.|pg||
nt|jcmax: So maybe one should play for that.|pg||
nt|xenya: just continue hearts -- when W gets in with a spade, he playes the @CQ -- that should work|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcmax: I believe declarer will play for the doubleton @S honour and run the @S J now|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  The more diamonds he plays the more the winning defence becomes clear|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Now is the moment of truth|pg||
nt|jcmax: On the actual layout he can never make the hand with correct defence.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: that would be spectacular defence|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|chrisdixon:  Oops!|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: note that a small club allows it to make|pg||

nt|paulg:  In the other matches, England lead Ireland 59-54 imps and Wales lead the WBU (Wales II) by 45-41 imps|pg||
nt|toobad: 3nt?|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  You have to alert partner to an unusual lead here - you just need him to have 1 entry|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Opportunity missed, I feel.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well wales had chanc e to gain 11 imps on that board and only gained 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: not much breaking well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 12 imps to wales on the one where it went 1@D-4@S-5@D-X here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sheila a: NS likely to bid 3NT and likely to be disappointed|pg||
nt|paulg:  The schedule restart is in 30 minutes, 21:50 GMT|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT looks set fair |pg||
nt|garnetts: 10 tricks in 3NT looks excessive until you look at the nice friendly layout |pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Here is a more routine 4@H|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last hand.  Thanks to David, Justin and Chris.  Thanks to the operator and to CBAI and BBO.  Second half of this match starts at 12:20 GMT|pg||
nt|lestergold: they cannot afford to pass up such chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: in the other room, 1@D-4@S, all out|pg||
nt|peachy: last hand coming up. Thanks all. http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php schedule for more vugraph, all times are local to you.|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: (rather improbably)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I certainly agree--seems to me you have a duty to tell partner somehting useful--random to pass--rather lack of engagement |pg||
nt|rmb1: ... in 45 minutes|pg||

nt|lestergold: what is this??|pg||
nt|dagold: why did 3@s make?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: I like the negative redouble here as east promising 0 or 1 in partner's suit--pass and double with balanced values |pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C looks like a transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: hearts break spades on  side -not reall problems in 3NT|pg||
nt|dagold: wasn't it one off at the end?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sheila a: 1@d is unbal with either minor, 1NT is a game force|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|chick: West must be considering slam possibilities|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does south have tio hold to bid over 3@h|pg||
pc|h9|nt|toobad: D or S?|pg||
nt|greerm: no reason to think of a @D|pg||
nt|greerm: hard to see how this will make, but 8 tricks there so....|pg||
nt|toobad: needs help|pg||
nt|greerm: defence might let him set up a @H trick ?|pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|justin c: very fair, not set|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rmb1: NS play four card majors (not come up before in this set)|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like the slam hand has made the difference this set|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  the defence has to be quite careful to beat this I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normal lead normal contract J@H normal play @C to the Q--then we can all go back to sleep for a while |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|greerm: North will have to find the @D suit soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: i admit he is minimum but he cannot pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: no|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  needs to switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am truly amazed that West passed 4@S in the OR--must have failed to pay an entry fee |pg||
nt|dagold: north had a double too as a passed hand|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: 1 0ff means they gain 3 imps|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|greerm: home now|pg||
nt|garnetts: the "@D bid did not have much appeal to be honest and anyway south has ignored it |pg||
nt|peachy: 1C was 11-13 balanced, or any 17+|pg||
nt|chick: looks like the same 11 tricks|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  He can take two @S finesses and end up with 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  in some relay systems south would have shown nothing about her hand on this auction|pg||
nt|paulg:  and it would do her no good at all this time|pg||
nt|sheila a: Unless West is put off leading a @s and tries a @c ...|pg||
nt|chick: especially with that lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chessmaste: That was a good (inspired?) decision by North to pass 3@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|justin c: this is the last board of this set|pg||
nt|justin c: many thanks all|pg||
nt|garnetts: lthanks all  |pg||
nt|justin c: and we restart at 15.10 (in theory)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT is interesting|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sheila a: Scotland edge into the lead thanks to a tiny swing on the awkward board 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: but had they played 3 clubs doubnoled 2 off tghey would have gained 11|pg||
pc|h6|nt|greerm: missed the "obvious " squeez that we can see|pg||
nt|garnetts: totally agree--North seems to be agressive mostly then suddenly makes a very conservative pass |pg||
pc|s3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: j@S is the right card |pg||
nt|garnetts: In case partner has AQ10x|pg||
pc|h8|nt|toobad: Rex and David are bidding them up in the open room|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  10, South played 4@S got a diamond lead and the defence got their ruff but declarer disposed of his club losers as we thought might be possible|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rmb1: ... 4@S= only 1IMP to Wales|pg||
nt|justin c: low scoring set of boards|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|justin c: if the slam hand went the other way, v big difference|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: it looks difficuolt but it made so more imps to england|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chessmaste: Still, South did not bid 2@S which would have shown a strong raise, so he knew the dummy would be modest|pg||
nt|garnetts: ttfn |pg||
mc|9|nt|sheila a: hard to see any more than 7 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|diana1: the EW played in 3@c-2|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@c-1|pg||
nt|sheila a: Sime judged to pass the W hand over 1NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: which made things simpler|pg||
nt|paulg:  if Vi takes theis and plays a spade, then West may feel it is necessary to cash @cA for down one|pg||
nt|paulg:  or even ducks|pg||
nt|dagold: that was very soft by NS|pg||
nt|dagold: both hands had a bid|pg||
nt|justin c: thats all folks|pg||
nt|dagold: bye|pg||
nt|justin c: restart at 2.55 |pg||
nt|lestergold: bye and thx to my fellow commentators well played england|pg||
