mb|2D!|nt|mikeirl: silvertexter|pg||

nt|athene: EW are strong notrump, 5-card majors, weak-2@D@H@S, standard count, upside down attitude|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sheila a: I think I prefer 2@d from Sime's hand - if partner has 4 @h it's easy for him to bid them|pg||

nt|athene: garvey decides 2@D is a nice spot to stop - of course with his partner being a passed hand there is less danger of missing game, passing a transfer|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeirl: no defence to beat this|pg||
nt|sheila a: 3@c = minimum|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South worried about the diamond stopper|pg||
nt|sheila a: I presume partner could have asked about majors if he wanted, so his cards should be in minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: well judged|pg||
nt|peachy: I suspect Dbl was takeout oriented|pg||

nt|sheila a: I wouldn't want to be in it|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Assuming 4@D is a Splinter, North cues? Or worried about his spade stopper?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to avoid being forced to open up the hearts, if they want four tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sheila a: It's an odd sequence if S really did show minimum and N signed off in 3NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: ah now it makes more sense|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if North couls sign off in 4n?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cuttysark: Spade lead really the only one to give a problem - guess at trick one|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: yes, perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Again I beliee the dbl is 12-15 bal but has a 2nd option|pg||
nt|athene: a slightly wet pass of 1@H with south, in my opinion|pg||

nt|athene: but it's a bit tricky to know what to bid|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: 2@C must be some kind of checkback and 2@H denies 3 spades (my guess)|pg||
nt|sheila a: But what would E lead against 3NT?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 9 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even 3NT|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|peachy: with both 3-card spades and 4-card hearts, many will bid hearts|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|sheila a: They stayed low on the 4@s hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A triumph for sound opening bids|pg||
nt|athene: one thing about this 2-way club is, it comes up a LOT - like polish club|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mikeirl: exciting board this time - shud please Liz :)|pg||

nt|athene: so, if your opponents are playing a system like this, you really have to be on firm ground in the bidding, otherwise you are going to lose a lot of imps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: Not convinced by this double - looks like @DK is badly placed, and he has 2 spades|pg||

nt|sheila a: @h will become clear|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cuttysark: North not so pleased with the dummy. @DK is a trick after all, but the spade void is a blow|pg||
nt|sheila a: 5@s might have escaped for only 2 off - depends on how declarer tackles the @c|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Beginning to ahve a bad feeling about the internet connection....|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: No just a lot of thought|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Too late for that|pg||
nt|sheila a: Doubling a making contract isn't the end of the world, slipping an overtrick is more reprehensible|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 a middling card from a solid sequence, maybe suit-pref for diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: (@SQ would show a heart card; @S8 a club stop?)|pg||
nt|sheila a: declarer can only hope that E doesn't have the @d entry - nowhere else to go for tricks|pg||

nt|sheila a: Sorry, the W hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Would everybody respond 1@H as East? They play Walsh, but with game values they can bid diaonds first. If West had reslised that perhaps he should bid 4@H, having already shown 3 ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: diamonds with a Suport Dbl|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would Pass the West hadn, then when partner re-opened with a dbl I could bid hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: that sure ruined South's pretty hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jtr: Wow Kokish overcall|pg||
nt|athene: you would expect a simple 4@S overcall from north, given partner is a passed hand|pg||

nt|jtr: This is not possible|pg||
nt|athene: all this soundness and you might find yourself losing ten imps|pg||

nt|mdgraham: did West really open 1@C and then double 1@s?|pg||
nt|jtr: Wrong cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: would you pas 1@s with S hand?|pg||
nt|athene: it all seems unlikely :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: @s won't play as badly as all that, especially if the force in @h is avoided|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: it's a good auction but not on these hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You doubt that Marta is doing the right thing??|pg||
nt|sheila a: Short gave hard thought to making a game try; Walker gave none to declining it|pg||
nt|athene: repeated trump leads normal against this sort of contract, but they aren't hurting it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Shame on you!|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chick: very bad hand to try and get a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can always just draw trumps and make five tricks from trumps and four from clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzxx: and we are home :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: one trump, no certainly that partner has any entry at all|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: well, enterprising bidding by West, then |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marta made an error in 1991, not a single one after that|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: home in a way, but 6@D was a nicer property to live in|pg||
nt|jtr: The whole bidding has dry rot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This auction is perhaps not textbook, but it is correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I've just noticed that cards A@s is swaped with k@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West would surely pass 1@S with his hand, opposite a partner who has passed |pg||
nt|ady: the auction seems odd  1@S overcall?   then re-opening with the west hand   and the opening1@C?   can anyone explain|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it is differs with bbo layout, but other cards are fine|pg||
nt|mdgraham: er, no|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think we have a Mystery|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they don't have the cards we see on our screens|pg||
nt|jtr: I think the hands got scambled in cyberspace|pg||
nt|jtr: No maybe about it Roland|pg||
nt|jtr: But surely Marta can see?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could it be board 27 or 28, Marta?|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikeirl: They're in 4@S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yorkbeach:  West could not really have had any less for 3NT but I knew Peter would go for the @cQ|pg||
nt|justin c: the good news is that 9 tricks are available here|pg||

nt|athene: (@HAQ, @CA, @CAK and the ruff)|pg||
nt|sheila a: unlucky to wrong side it|pg||
nt|mikeirl: this lead should defeat it by one|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings before the last round|pg||

nt|justin c: the bad news is that the same 9 were available in 3NT|pg||

pc|s4|nt|jtr: But then you make 10|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  it surprised me that South did not open - he opens a lot of 11 counts|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: yes, and another 5 here they aren't going to score|pg||
nt|athene: @H9 a trump peter, showing 3 trumps and a desire to ruff something, i guess|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: 4N?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: Just lose 3@ds 1@c|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: in fact 3NT comes home as defence get end played   declarer cashing the spades the defence is forced to play hearts after the diamonds   |pg||
nt|sheila a: The defence will be able to get their @s ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: with @SJ dropping, @s9 is an entry|pg||

nt|mikeirl: imps for Scotland on Board 28 - E/W are in 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: you might even consider rising the @HK here, to start clubs from the right side|pg||
nt|athene: on the grounds that the spades are more of a worry than the hearts anyway|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|jtr: True|pg||

nt|sheila a: It looks like an opening bid to me, to be fair|pg||

nt|sheila a: But Sime is thinking .....|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He pulled a double yesterday to a game he just might have made - hopefully he has learned something|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 5@D is trouble!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|sheila a: Phew!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to trust partner in these situations - gives you the shouting rights|pg||
nt|sheila a: That's the danger of doubling for one off - you give your partner another chance to bid :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: I think Matheson is hoping for at least 2 down|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: normal to lead to a big one first with that suit, if you have enough entries to dummy|pg||
mc|11|nt|milton_se: no way to nine tricks unless South lets go of a spade -- or they set up a H|pg||
