mb|2H|nt|bridge_one: strong @C also for E/W|pg||
nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/hanlon-mcgann.pdf  EW system card|pg||
nt|garnetts: very interesting hand--who does it belong to?  |pg||
nt|idc: Both pairs here 15-17 NT and 5 card majors|pg||
mb|2S|nt|justin c: NS, in theory|pg||
nt|peachy: EW system card http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/roderick-best.pdf|pg||
mb|3H|nt|diablo666: Actually 10 in clubs normally just mean that you don´t like the suit, rare with Lavinthal in these positions in Sweden.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is interesting - SUCTION - one suit in @H or two suit @S@C|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@D = shortage|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the dealer all day has been less than kind re distribution  |pg||
nt|idc: Last set saw Matheson open a frisky 3rd seat 9 count, but this is more than I'd expect from him|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so this is a frisky 5 count|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not ok|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/TeddSalisburyCC090918.pdf  NS system card|pg||
nt|rmb1: But are NS English or Welsh?|pg||
nt|justin c: let them bid a bit more :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW have nine tricks in spades and NS 11 in clubs --but not perhaps in hearts |pg||
nt|idc: Well spotted Hugh - this looks like right board (at least it matches other matches Bd1)|pg||
nt|daman: I would have raised North's 4@S bid had I held the South hand|pg||
nt|daman: tell those guys to get in the program Hugh|pg||
nt|idc: I'm sure operator just typed in final contract to avoid getting behind table|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: sry had to catch up not sure the opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome back, this is the second half or WBU-Scotland match|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: welcome to this all-ticket confrontation|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Walker is *thinking* in the other room Roland|pg||
nt|justin c: rehi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Website for Camrose resultsm running scores, and other info http://www.cbai.ie/|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfect fit here but still difficult to find slam|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|greerm: good evening, this is the first CAmrose cap for Willie Hamilton, brother of Ian, we wish him well|pg||
nt|garnetts: South did very well to start with 2@C|pg||
nt|rmb1: Much easier when your suits break 3-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have thought that the ability to show short @d might have excited Selway given his control reach no trump not to mention 5 spades|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: NS can make 3N pretty easily|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  pretty similar systems for both pairs, 5-card majors, strong 1NT and three weak 2s|pg||
nt|greerm: Willie has also represented Northern Ireland at fencing in I think the Commonwealth Games|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: this is on a diamond guess -- not too hard considering N has opened|pg||
nt|peachy: An easy hand to start with, no special problems for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: the lead J@S is a surprise holding QJ10987 in @H|pg||
nt|justin c: a @h and a @S to lose here|pg||
nt|justin c: who is winning this event lately?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|po-s: EW can sacrifice in 4D or S|pg||
nt|chick: If they think the 3N is making, yes :)|pg||
nt|justin c: saw WBU in the lead for a while yesterday|pg||
nt|justin c: If 3@S for East, which looks more normal, still not clear they would get there|pg||
pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: dummy was a disappointment - |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: but South think to find a suit better that @H, because his K in @C is very bad after 3@C by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: at least there is no money involved |pg||
nt|odysseus69: with a banced 15 it is normal to bid 3NT over 3D - but sometimes it can lead to a big penalty though not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to find a discard from dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond looks best|pg||
nt|garnetts: would you have expressed an opinion about 3NT Victor ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i am too much of a coward - but you would be there David - what do you think about club king as alternative lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think it best for the usual reasons |pg||
nt|justin c: am told CBAI in the lead by 1 point|pg||

pc|s5|nt|chick: but would still be more for NS than this will be |pg||
nt|po-s: or think that 4S makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: they had the kit to reach slam and Erichsen used it but Selway opted for the conservative |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c3|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: the question is: the opps probably have 9 tricks - the lead @H try to beat the contract finding any good layout - the lead @S need to find more cards |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|garnetts: should have held this ace up too perhaps |pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: uptrick now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rmb1: WBU is the Welsh second team.  The hosts for the second weekend of the event are invited to send a second team (to both weekends)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s6|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: note that played by east it was a good slam even if the K@h had been wrong|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: It means you never bid the suit you have - it's a rule of modern bridge :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|idc: I assumed it was 'transfer' but I thought 'xfr' was the standard WBF abbreviation for that|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: 3NT wide-ranging in this situation. No room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: he could double and bid 3nt later...not like it is a 3@S opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: *** LIVE IN RUNNING CAMROSE SCORES *** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then "browse results" then 1o3.txt  ***|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So Salisbury should not hang partner. He did not promise 25-27|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|3for3: no.  i think he should double first though|pg||
nt|idc: Ok, have checked and TRF is the standard WBF abbreviation for transfer - learn something new every day|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do they get to 3NT then?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|3for3: if partner bids on the 3 level, you bid 3nt.  If not, you might have slam|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, you are right, Danny. I saw it as 3@S|pg||
nt|3for3: Ah, I see.  |pg||

nt|chick: I look forward to seeing what happens at the other table :)|pg||
nt|justin c: would it not be better to invite another country to join in rather than have two teams from same place?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be exciting|pg||
nt|daman: I know he did that   I was making light|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing the second heart would have removed any diamond guess (not that there was much to uess)|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: could end up anywhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: plenty of disaster potential on thisn deal|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bridge_one: yes, open weak NT :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: dbl|pg||
nt|justin c: double|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rmb1: If they were to invite a team from the near continent (France/Netherlands) they would win :)|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||

nt|lestergold: followd by no trumps i expect|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
nt|idc: Sorry George, humour deserted me for a minute :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D looks best here -- might not be easy to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: they are so aggressive that is possible to see 3@H now|pg||
nt|paulg:  normal high level bridge, three passes to you and then no-one passes before your next call|pg||
nt|chick: first they have to get into the bidding|pg||
nt|peachy: Second seat Vul maybe kept Salisbury from opening|pg||
nt|peachy: not unreasonable at all, when the suits are minors|pg||
nt|po-s: if he bids 3C I will leave|pg||
nt|peachy: heh PO|pg||
nt|justin c: isle of man suggested by two kibs|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not at all convinced by that %@C effort --do you think he thought he had no defence |pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@C |pg||
nt|justin c: tho judging by what i saw yesterday, they too might win|pg||
nt|justin c: this lacks aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has no choice|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@H-2NT-3@D perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might regret that|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now brown cow?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: 2@s does not play that badly north will be endplayed a lot|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: I dont know much about the Welsh pair. They will do well to restrainIrelands leading pair|pg||
nt|garnetts: clear cut 3@D bid now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and then 3NT?|pg||
nt|chick: whew!!   we want po to stay!!|pg||
nt|garnetts: quite--why bid over 4@C ?  I think its a sort of reaction bid--failed to think first |pg||
nt|justin c: now 2NT i think|pg||
nt|justin c: and 3@D for S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: which given its normal standard, some would say is a blessing|pg||
nt|idc: Rather a view from West but he's escaped the @d lead so no harm done|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All five of us!|pg||
nt|peachy: I am happy you can stay now po|pg||
nt|roswolf: disaster looms if south shows a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now will Tedd give up|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this correct?|pg||
nt|daman: it seems to me Stayman would have been helpgul|pg||
nt|daman: f*|pg||
nt|idc: 2@s is a range probe, so I guess 2NT showed minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I doube N bid 3 nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: *doubt|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: in money game DBL now for sure |pg||
nt|justin c: quality that counts Mark|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks, I maintain it is a difficult hand to find slam on|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: in IMP competition need to be more safe|pg||
nt|justin c: speaking of quality, this 3NT contract lacks it|pg||
nt|justin c: horrible contract, but neither N nor S can remotely put a red card on it|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nothing exceptional here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not clear cut is it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: he should be able to envisage the near yarborough opposite|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the guns ring out|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  3@c is a brave call as Sime was not guaranteed a fit (Matheson might hold five hearts for example)|pg||
nt|greerm: helpful lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  blame the 2@s bidder|pg||
nt|justin c: so i guess this will just drift several off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very respectful of partners balancing action|pg||
nt|garnetts: Probably done well to pass as 3NT needs the diamond finesse and thats certainly not clearcut |pg||
nt|garnetts: this contrcat needs the same view I suppose too|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am afraid that I would have overcalled with 2@S earlier |pg||
nt|po-s: even without an opening by West|pg||
nt|justin c: had a feeling this auciton would end with a red card from somebody|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|greerm: when the other 3 suits look dangerous too|pg||
nt|lestergold: he hasnt got the message but Selway comes to life and gives it to him|pg||
nt|xenya: hardly any problem with 3N though -- with the club suit blocked|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Roderick should not have sold out to 1@S in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: perhaps he feared they could make a game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After the strong club he was able to show hearts first. Then he he could have bid 2@D next|pg||

mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: not much to get excited about here|pg||
nt|rmb1: We didn't think of that!|pg||
nt|justin c: was thinking a @S lead will beat 5@H EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: where they would presumably play after a higher @D preempt|pg||
nt|garnetts: I had some antiquted idea that a busybody on some laws committee said you could not psyche your sides strong bid--perosnally I would make it compulsory |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i'm not sure the Scottish East will bid 2@s, but West may push anyhow|pg||

nt|sheila a: South's hand is pretty poor but NV she figured it was worth a pre-empt|pg||
nt|greerm: not a brilliant contract but...|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for anyone except Deep Finesse or GIB to find the @cK lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: south will show his shape nopw with 3@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he chose to show club guard i prefer 3@c as it serves same purpose but shows void heart|pg||
nt|peachy: surprising turn in auction|pg||

pc|c2|nt|po-s: just forcing probably|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT showed max, either bal or with support|pg||
nt|rmb1: That regulation has been dropped (in England)|pg||
nt|justin c: ive never been clear on what qualifies as psyching your strong bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: Let me be clear I would rather chew my own arm off than open with 3@D |pg||
nt|justin c: saw a 2@C opening yesterday on a solid @S suit and not a lot else|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: Hi Lars :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N by default as we may have predicted|pg||
pc|c8|nt|diablo666: Hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats a pretty well thought out sequence |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
nt|po-s: I think he should appreciate his spade doubleton as extra trick value in a club contract|pg||
nt|idc: I'd feel a little worried as West not having bid @c at all, but it has worked well enough this hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: 8 tricks easy but where is 9th coming from?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not convinced that heart was best lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bt: it seems skara is still winning, but 2 game swings will put it in jeopardy|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit busy on this misfit auction|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Nothing to the play - 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: Being declarer did have some value in protecting his two AQ holdings|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: wastes energy thinking here when you know its a spread |pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer spade passive|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|justin c: after 2@C-2@D-4@S, partner passed and put down an ace and a king etc|pg||
nt|rmb1: opening 2@C (strong, artificial) on South hand would be a psyche|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think we sort of disagreed on that lol --it was EW here that bid it |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|garnetts: it has almost certainly kept EW low which is to their advantage |pg||
nt|justin c: potentially West being put in with the 4th @S to lead into the @HA7 at the end|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: However-- I would rather bid anyhting than 3@D --its sending a boy on a mans errand in spades |pg||
nt|lestergold: Tedd could now try to establish his long heart|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|bridge_one: another line would be to play 5 round of @C before the finesse in @H|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|idc: Runing the clubs can lead to a squeeze for 11 tricks I think|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
mc|9|nt|po-s: I suppose declarer might have had 4135 with more points and worse clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: 2@D seems normal|pg||
nt|idc: I'm all for the Norths' decision not to overcall 1NT - not good enough vul|pg||
nt|3for3: spade lead, and low club shift!|pg||
nt|idc: by about 2 or 3 points|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|3for3: 2nt leaves partner ALOT of room.  I'd just bid 3nt. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|galadriel: Hmmm....@H lead?|pg||
nt|3for3: of course a club lead and heart shift beats it on power.  but i doubt that|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah yes|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Everyone     lots of snow in my yard :)|pg||
nt|idc: Well, you won't need a drink then|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|3for3: 11 Imps to Wales here. If they make.  But the low club shift still possible on winning spade ace?|pg||
nt|idc: Sorry, couldn't resist the Scottish stereotype joke|pg||
nt|idc: Nicely spotted Danny|pg||
nt|3for3: does he play partner for the heart ace of the club ten/jack?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|3for3: moment of truth|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer can place East with Kxxxx hearts on lead, so still a chance that he'll get clubs right, but not easy|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

nt|galadriel: well done!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: i should have said he may get clubs right since West on bidding will have at least AKTx and just as likely AKQx of clubs|pg||

nt|Walddk4: What was the contract and result on 17, guys?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OK; done|pg||
nt|paulg:  we have seen a lot of two-suiters tonight, perhaps the theme of the weekend|pg||
nt|greerm: 3C+2 by Norht on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: ok we are back! lost the play on 19, sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: well played :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT for EW here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
nt|paulg:  the play on 19 would have been uninteresting, we can live without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: figured as much :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has a clear 3@S opening in my view these 6-4 hands usually play well and the spades are pretty good |pg||
nt|odysseus69: will South double 3 hearts?-|pg||
nt|justin c: nv against vul looks like a 5@D opening to me|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play Benji Acol, strong NT and 5-card suits (incl diam)|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he does willNort pass|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Acol and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|justin c: which might get a huge result if you find a @S lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I absolutely agree|pg||
nt|justin c: choice of games to play here|pg||
nt|xenya: popular auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes and about as difficult to make as the last one |pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: If NS get to some number of no-trumps there is a classic intra finesse position in clubs |pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT by N maybe here|pg||
nt|peachy: Even those who do not pass if they hold a King as responder, surely will pass this time|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
nt|justin c: y indeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S or 3@S Victor?  |pg||
pc|c7|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: double explained as promising 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets see if they can do it in defence |pg||
nt|justin c: close to 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: this will tell us |pg||
nt|odysseus69: the ultra conservative approach continues|pg||
nt|garnetts: I bet he would bid 4@H over 3@S |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|greerm: seems a simpel 1 off, anyone see anything lese?|pg||
nt|justin c: too early for difficult contracts|pg||
nt|justin c: off on a @C lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: 43/ spade game looks reasonable but 3N makes with the favourable position in the minors|pg||
nt|justin c: seems to me 5@D needs the @D finesse and nothing else|pg||
nt|bridge_one: read now ACOL for e/w, but 5 cards Major|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk3: Give us Man Utd|pg||
nt|bt: what are the chances of that roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Non-existent|pg||
nt|bt: seems board 23-24 are slightly favorable for skara|pg||
nt|bt: well skara is winning here so|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like 3S bur expected 2|pg||
nt|justin c: while 3NT needs a @C position also|pg||
nt|lestergold: east was bound to bid 3N with his q high holdings |pg||
pc|d2|nt|chessmaste: Looks like the same ten tricks too|pg||
nt|rmb1: X|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT  for running scores|pg||
nt|justin c: another double?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|diana1: very hard for Vi to imagine that Charles has also 3 losing @hs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: technically he should have passed 3@d but risks worth taking for vul game|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT is the par spot|pg||
nt|xenya: plat du jour, so to speak|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: Declarer could try for extra tricks in either black suit?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|justin c: S might have continued here|pg||
nt|idc: spades works well, clubs maybe not so well|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||
nt|garnetts: my current pet idea 6-4 with a reasonable six carder open three|pg||
nt|daman: spades work for sure|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|garnetts: For me yes--I would give it one more try |pg||
nt|justin c: if only to play 3@D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: but this might make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: he knows where the king of clubs is so ak of hearts then ace of clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: losing only 2 @H can try both |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|garnetts: North might just float it |pg||
pc|cK|nt|bt: the natural play works|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but right start @S|pg||
pc|c9|nt|diana1: so early on in the match she is probably going for what she thinks is the safest thing|pg||
nt|paulg:  all the reasons are there to make North declarer on this hand, but it just did not work here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that west should bid 1@D rather than pass--playing a system where 1@C can be short alolows you to respond on garbage when you have short clubs  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: oops- bad play|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer gets it right|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten tricks now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: wasnt difficult on the lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bt: did north just discard a winner?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|garnetts: so was that |pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: had better play a @H now to save IMPs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W play 1@C 2+C and 1@D = 4+cards|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|sK|nt|peachy: even a magician would go down|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: home now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could play also @S for the A and small @C at the Q|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bt: no probs yet for skara but ...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|justin c: with @S1098 can afford to try the @C finesse, still safe |pg||
nt|justin c: going a few off in a 3-2 fit at 100 a trick is an expensive business|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club ruff was a stand out - bad play all  round|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now three clubs and exit with a @D or a spade |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|rmb1: Cross ruff and pick up @CJ might jsut make|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|idc: N-S play Smith Peters but North clearly not able to play spades in a meaningful way|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C and 2@d are strong open  -  2Maj weak 5+cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok all sorry I have to leave for a lunch date,  have fun |pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk3: Maybe you could tell the audience where in the world Skara is located (other than in Sweden)|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like E needed to play a diamond early to set up 7th trick for his side|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know?|pg||
nt|bt: where is it?|pg||
nt|bt: :-)|pg||
nt|diablo666: Skara is about 150 km northeast of Göteborg.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|justin c: @DQ, @D ruff, @H ruff low|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: for north need to find A in @C in East - then now @D is correct|pg||
nt|bt: close to åmål, of movie fame?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|h4|nt|diablo666: Nopr, wrong side of Lake Vänern :) .|pg||
nt|bt: wrong side of sweden also :-)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4 imp|pg||
nt|bt: 17 and 18 coming up are exactly what skara wants|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|paulg:  would everyone double 3@s? Or is a risk you just need to take?|pg||
nt|greerm: I think most bid 4C|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rmb1: timing is wrong now|pg||
nt|justin c: i think he is off now, isnt he|pg||
nt|rmb1: spade discard from N stopped the ruff|pg||
nt|justin c: predictably|pg||

nt|justin c: hi Dan|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hello Dan |pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmmmmmmm|pg||

nt|garnetts: true but then South could not have been suitably manipulated as he was |pg||
nt|odysseus69: wise not to double!!|pg||

nt|rmb1: More on a non-spade lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: but very hard to find unless West bids |pg||
nt|justin c: @S lead stopping 6@H|pg||
nt|idc: Best game here is 4@h on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|peachy: two-way club again, 11-13 bal OR strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: This is the slight downside to the Multi, in that it's easier for E to come in over 2@d than 2@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|greerm: 3NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: but the chances of doing so were dramatically improved by N endplaying S|pg||
nt|rmb1: Now it will be difficult to stop East|pg||

nt|bridge_one: but down the same playing @s by North |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|garnetts: this theme came up in the first set--do you guys think 1@S is best or 2@C?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Canape opening |pg||
nt|garnetts: interesting |pg||
nt|garnetts: Now no one will know who the hand belongs to --if North pre-empts |pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen has opted top make a cautious bid here but selway will bid again |pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: very true|pg||
nt|justin c: i think souths pass suggests playing in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: likely to finish in a partcsore --1NT or 2@S |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@C for me|pg||
nt|idc: even on @c leads you can probably beat it by keep pounding on clus|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: not the greatest dummy but has chances|pg||
nt|greerm: in theory 4@C 2@S 2@D and 1@H |pg||

pc|cT|nt|justin c: 3NT or 4@S here i think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@S is possible|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit I would have bid 4@S over 3@D --I think it is right to pressurise here |pg||
nt|garnetts: EW really missed a chnace in my view |pg||
nt|idc: clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: no beating around the bush here -- indeed 4@S by E looks a good practical bid |pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  i don't think they can, but a few concerns for declarer|pg||
pc|c9|nt|paulg:  the upside is that West may not have a cue bid available|pg||
nt|garnetts: Norman did well to avoid 2@C |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6 tricks for the defence here - but the play is long ....|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|greerm: he that hesitates is lost ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: strange auction on Board three in the OR  and they failed to double the final contract and still gained 5 imps |pg||
nt|odysseus69: The Irish South must have heard your tip David - he opened 3D with 6-4 on board 2 and picked up 5 imps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bt: we had an undo. makes more sense now. maybe there should be a bid for the west hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like 2@c as well|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: well I agree I much prefer 2@C |pg||
nt|daman: he has to run his @Ds and hope the oppspitch poorley|pg||

nt|daman: still only 8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hoping @S return|pg||
nt|idc: I love that expression!|pg||
nt|daman: right     good thought|pg||
pc|s3|nt|justin c: for one thing, 2@C to be followed with 2@S is more economical than 1@S then 3@C, as here|pg||
nt|garnetts: he did--but I wouldn't bid it with a side major unless partner had passed laready |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|justin c: which has helped N find the best lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: no choice here simple heart finesse for 9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|justin c: intra the @S suit :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes I forgot we all overbid here nbecause we are such great card players these days |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will not be easy - at the very least needs an intra finesse in spades  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|sheila a: I think if partner bids one major have to use the other as a cue|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Always easy to overbid from the commentators seat|pg||
nt|garnetts: If plays the intra he likely looked --he will surely try and ruff a club and try ace and another spade|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I suspect he will struggle whatever he does|pg||

nt|justin c: helping declarer to finesse the @H10 later|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|garnetts: maybe that is a better idea than helping partner--|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: He must be so glad he played that Q@H now |pg||
pc|c6|nt|bt: people usually dont work much on 1X-(1N)-?? in their system, pretty common auction|pg||
pc|d8|nt|greerm: looks like defence can make it difficult but not quite difficult enough|pg||
nt|greerm: @C now only postpones it|pg||
nt|paulg:  a club now would force declarer to guess the layout|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S have @D, greter that @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: and does show the five four shape you actually have--C plus S  not the other way round |pg||
pc|c4|nt|rmb1: OK 12 tricks on a non-spade lead was a bit double-dummy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|odysseus69: veer windy- partner opened 3D vulnerable in 2nd seat and it looked like 4 tricks in his own hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: he has to play a club --no option |pg||
nt|chessmaste: No reason to play the king here - unless you are on declarer's side|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|diablo666: 2cl is allowed, but i suspect the closer we get to the final board the more reluctant EW will be to stuck out their necks :) .|pg||
nt|xenya: are we stuck?|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing two diamonds off the top would have worked for defense but in real life a diaomnd lead from N is never coming|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes and it makes |pg||

nt|justin c: 3NT or 5@C for NS here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Another easy game for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: at those colours north was rather likely to have one high card|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: not tooo regular, bad suit, bad hand, first seat vul|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT here |pg||
nt|garnetts: The point about the last hand is that not evryone will bid 1@S and when he did--they should have reaped the rewards|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@d splinter?|pg||
nt|justin c: 2NT 20-22|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no- probably 1 down regardless - i failed to spot club position|pg||
nt|peachy: Second seat vul would be worse, at least in first seat there are two opps to preempt|pg||
nt|peachy: prepared club, 1D, 1H, and 1S would be 5-card suits for EW|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|justin c: 3@C 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|rmb1:  2 was flat in 5@CX-1 on the same auction: West raising with defence and little chance that 5@C was making|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Not all weak NT players would open the E hand 1NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@c is a very wide-ranging call .. i think North will be a little nervous until dummy hits|pg||
nt|justin c: looking for 5-3 @H fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: well a club will be out of the question and if South makes a passive trump lead it won't make--attacks with a spade curtains too |pg||
nt|idc: This should be comfortable unless declarer decides to play North for @d length|pg||
mb|2S|nt|toobad: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: a spirited dbl by I H|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: trump looks normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: another push board|pg||
nt|diana1: pity Burns didnt bid 2@c to show sme sort of a weak hand with majors as then Lindsay may have found a 3@s bid which does very nicely|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps H & H |pg||
nt|garnetts: that will not take any prisoners either |pg||
nt|garnetts: I quite like the 2@C bid--good psyche|pg||
nt|justin c: coffee time here|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C may be systemic: clubs or GF balanced, as some play; but its not on their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: as well as the distibution markibng south with 3 hearts 2 of mwhich he had discarded i admiot that it would have been good la to rapidly blamnk the K but it does not happen opften ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: in practice|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thid Dbl by south give too much informations at declarer|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|justin c: 5 imps to England for playing 3@D instead of 3NT brd 2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts:  I think 3NT after 3@D likely shows 4-4 majors and that leaves 3@H as a relay|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@h, i am told, denies 4@H but does not promise 4@S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bt: and if skara wins they qualify for the champions cup or whatever its called, i think|pg||
nt|justin c: make of that what you will :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  i expect this will be a swing .. nice redouble from Matheson|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sheila a: Yes, that would have worked better|pg||
nt|justin c: predictably enough|pg||
nt|garnetts: an old fashioned 3@C raise--it used to be a transfer to 3NT (:)) but in good style strongly suggests playing in the suit|pg||
nt|idc: It's a bit of a matchpoint dbl (and I rarely mean that as a compliment!)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|djneill:  South was listening clearly|pg||
nt|odysseus69: do we know what 3C meant?|pg||
nt|garnetts: K@S is surely obvious--since you doscouraged with the six --then you know partner has only two :) |pg||
nt|odysseus69: presumably 2D was a game forcing relay|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am reasonably sure it means clubs --|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|sheila a: N couldn't be blamed for leading a @h against 3NT, which won't be a great success|pg||
mb|2S|nt|garnetts: back to my usual comments about opening bad 11 counts |pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe they play Drury- if so North would be troubled- but ok|pg||
nt|garnetts: not much I do understand about the bidding these days --but if 3@D is a splinter they have done well |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I would guess Rdbl says equal length? whaddya think Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I am getting too old --I have never liked drury much either |pg||
nt|idc: North risking an overbid to make sure they find a major fit - not a huge overbid mind you|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  could be blamed now :)|pg||
nt|diana1: yes probably or else he is upgrading his hand and showing the normal 23-24|pg||
nt|lestergold: no selway has shown excellent judgment |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: what is 3NT supposed to mean?   3@S I get but 3NT?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5 clubs now enough|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe thinking about 4 clubs but not a good idea|pg||
nt|odysseus69: partner marked with 4-4-1-4 now|pg||
nt|garnetts: what is 3NT then?  Am I being stupid?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: i thinh- only 4 hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: oh sure -- and vulnerable too -- but hard to resist the temptation|pg||
nt|peachy: trump lead seems obvious to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: 6-5 come alive |pg||
nt|garnetts: No need to play a 4-3 fit--why risk it |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i think redouble says pick your longest major|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  2NT is a minor pre-empt, so they may play some form of kokish|pg||
nt|djneill:  David are you saying that East can use the information from the opening now to find the big honors?|pg||
nt|justin c: 9 imps to wales for making 3NT on brd 20|pg||
nt|justin c: intra finesse in @C, as predicted|pg||
nt|justin c: (east doubled the opening bid, making that the indicated line)|pg||
nt|garnetts: partly yes--also it makes life hard for partner knowing when to compete--and also leads to too many abd contracts |pg||
nt|garnetts: no objection in third seat though |pg||
nt|justin c: certainly reassuring on this board to know the @HA is in S, so you have an entry for @S tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: there was an earlier hand where North had a nine count after partner opened but did not compete on board 19 |pg||
nt|peachy: this lead COULD have been brilliant on another layout|pg||
nt|idc: Just looking at E-W hands 5@c is a possible sac but cards lie badly|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to ruff otherwise down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: 4@S with A A and Q of trump is conservative|pg||
nt|bt: y i agree, was a sweet hand|pg||
nt|diana1: yes I think they do|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Vi knows this is from 3 she can duck|pg||
nt|garnetts: I see what you mean--3@S shows maybe five hearts and 3NT  4-4-4-1   nice |pg||
nt|idc: And as you note, 4@h not made yet|pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: trump lead would solve all|pg||
nt|garnetts: the lead isn't exactly damaging is it |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|paulg:  still only four tricks for the defence ... really need to lead both blacks suits to trick one|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think South can consider many things here, it is hard to know which is best|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course AQ is very adequare support opposie rebid hearts|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bt: i assume west didnt splinter because of @CA singelton, and east then assumed no shortness, thats the only explanation for 4@S on such a prime hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  and, naturally, continue both blacks suits when in with the diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: well a @D was |pg||

pc|d5|pc|s7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|paulg:  then declarer would have been on a guess on the spade position (might be 5-2) or play for hearts 3-3|pg||

pc|c2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: it is always so discouraging when you lead a trump and dec draws trumps--then you know a tempo is lost |pg||

nt|sheila a: thank goodness that hand is over, Paul's analysis was too confusing for me |pg||

nt|justin c: if you dont know where the @HA is, could get the play wrong form that point|pg||
nt|peachy: although either one was successful|pg||
nt|idc: Small lead for Scotland, Walker/Short in other room stopping in 3@d sensibly on Bd 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: i dont think EW play acol 2 |pg||
nt|paulg:  weak twos|pg||
nt|greerm: so difficult hand for Willie H|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime might even bid 4@s here|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a routine 3NT |pg||
nt|bridge_one: slam for E/W depending on @D 2-2|pg||
nt|idc: Hmmm, almost a 4 or 6 hand if West plays in @d on @sJ lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sheila a: I see Sime-Matheson were lured into doubling 5@h on board 3|pg||
nt|sheila a: Aha, the 2-way @c springs into action|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@c is 11-13 balanced or any strong hand .. Lindsay will think he knows which|pg||
nt|paulg:  generally best to pass with very strong hands|pg||
nt|sheila a: It looks as if EW play 2-suited jump overcalls but maybe not over a murky @c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like back to 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: 3@H are ON - 3@S down finding the ruff in @C|pg||
nt|paulg:  sorry, I might even bid 4@s here .. Iain will settle for two spades|pg||
nt|toobad: not after 1280|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Acol style|pg||
nt|justin c: another 3NT...|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe 4@H  |pg||
nt|lestergold: junior imn gae to me senior in bridge|pg||
nt|dagold: you are what?|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|bt: they went down in slam and may have to leave 1st division|pg||
nt|bt: not that 6@S was that great|pg||
nt|justin c: imdb says colin firth is in it|pg||
nt|justin c: u sure about this mark?|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could get out for -2 via an endplay -- +800 is juicy, particularly as 3N by NS is by no means cold|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|xenya: chance for Bjorken now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it seems that 2@c should be a strong 1-suited hand|pg||
nt|justin c: NS could get into trouble here|pg||
nt|garnetts: you should work out why a @D back is best--North clearly must have two or three clubs only so play partner for the right @D holding |pg||
nt|nagini: :)|pg||
nt|chick: If S thinks that is the @DA, he could get carried away|pg||
nt|garnetts: but not likely on this start|pg||
nt|lestergold: u are junior to me in age and senior to me in bridge i think that is fair to say|pg||
nt|dagold: well written|pg||
nt|idc: Meaning if you have a @d loser, can't even make game, so you might as well be in slam as 5@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes , so better call 6 :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|greerm: will not take long to play 3N|pg||
nt|toobad: next board|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime saved an overtrick|pg||
nt|paulg:  conceivable that some may bid 6@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: for a change|pg||
nt|dagold: North could double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only 3Nt is safe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: played by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Lindsay will want to do something more|pg||
nt|paulg:  double is most flexible|pg||
nt|paulg:  at least you are on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: Lindsay interrogating Outred...|pg||
nt|diana1: it says on their convention card that 2@c over a strong 1@c opening is natural|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think 3@C is what this rebid is worth |pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT looks on too |pg||
nt|garnetts: Q@H has its attractions |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes - 4@H too much :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks probable - 9 certain|pg||
nt|chick: safe now|pg||
nt|dagold: double more flexible but may miss 6-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: hope Espen doesn't bid 3@C|pg||
nt|dagold: he might|pg||
nt|lestergold: having opened with a 9 count and already rebid  his clubs i would have beedn surprised to hear 3@c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@C are on also over @D 2-2|pg||
nt|idc: Having bid fairly strongly tilll now, East may not cooperate much more - West may just have to blast slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is really thinking ?|pg||
nt|peachy: E giving tempo or trick with any lead|pg||
nt|peachy: not fun :)|pg||
nt|xenya: E endplayed at trick 1?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bridge_one: sry, 4@H too much (my yes was for pass at 3@S)|pg||
nt|paulg:  over a multi-way club it is 1-suiter (note 3)|pg||
nt|sheila a: neither explanation appears to match what he has|pg||
nt|garnetts: early calim coming I think |pg||
nt|garnetts: claim|pg||
nt|justin c: heres hoping|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|djneill:  2@h = "I'm not so bad"|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks like the least of the evils|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dagold: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh erichsen u mean|pg||
nt|dagold: that really is a chance missed by south|pg||
nt|dagold: I didnt mean Espen Selway|pg||
nt|dagold: if that is what you are asking|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: cant believe this goes unpunished|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: agree. Normally singleton trump is no good, but was good here|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|paulg:  seems he has no way to show a strong 2-suiter unless the minors|pg||
nt|diana1: yes sorry Paul you are right (I forgot about their notes)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 2@H-sufficient to make a try|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: anyone think North might double 3@D?  After all it must be optional |pg||
nt|justin c: not so sure about 2@H myself|pg||
nt|rmb1:  3 flat in 4H=.  At least crouch opened 4@D as South :)|pg||
nt|dagold: 4 and a bit tricks with a singleton in partner's suit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sheila a: this might be a let-off for NS|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|odysseus69: right to play low if declarer has KJ doubleton|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1IMP for Bj|pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down but probably by just 1 trick|pg||
nt|justin c: opposite a passed hand?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|justin c: 3NT is lucky rather than good|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Yes, 2@C looks like an underbid - still only a non vulnerable game|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: either red suit for 9 tricks -club for 10|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@D distinctly unswashbuckling|pg||
nt|dagold: down 3 is the target|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u agree with esricksen's 3@c it seems very dangerous to me oppsite a third in hand non vul opener|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: so an imp, yes|pg||
nt|sheila a: Could he possibly have bid @s and then @d?|pg||
nt|dagold: and he may acheive it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|idc: This is going to work well - I'd guess E-W in other room are unlikely to get to this one|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|nagini: this way?:)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: ensplayed for the second time|pg||
pc|cA|nt|justin c: in 3N, it just so happens that you can get to dummy in a red suit of yr choosing, and then collect the @CK (doubleton onside)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulg:  thinking that North has a balanced 11-13, then he probably thought he could|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dagold: usually 1@C then 2@C is not a light opener. I think 3@C is moderately normal|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: well you say that--but isn't that what we were just discussing--|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s4|pg||

nt|garnetts: I am not at all sure this sequence of plays has really happned --|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: next board interesting ; 4Nt quantitative less 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well do u think dounel by south is moderately normal?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: then I am getting punch drunk because I was looking at 3@D not 3@S |pg||
nt|garnetts: So just ignore me from now on |pg||
nt|justin c: if East doesnt open at the other table, conceivably NS end up in 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: so i guess 1@C-3@C is something truly awful|pg||
nt|garnetts: why the second double--3@C better isn't it?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: double looks a bad idea - why not 3C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't know if 2@C is conventional (similar gazzilli) but i think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: spec tells me 1NT was 15-17|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like to get in and out quickly with this hand type--3@C makes them find fit at that level 21D might let them in more easily |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@c was 5-card stayman|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with Mark 3NT looks like a good shot now |pg||
nt|justin c: needs a @S lead i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: six solid and a rag outside |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will westr lead a spade now?|pg||
nt|justin c: could even ruff out the @SA, but the entry position awkward for that|pg||

nt|chessmaste: All over for the defence now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: it looks as if McGann has overbid his cards and Hanlon may raise|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 3Nt instead 4Nt is a advantage|pg||
nt|greerm: out alive :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice auction from West ... this must show some slam interest with no diamond control|pg||
nt|justin c: grab this, pitch a @S on the @CA, and pull trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he knows his partner|pg||
nt|garnetts: To me this looks like a very strong sequence by East--the second double and then 4@C  |pg||
nt|garnetts: I am wondering why anyone would rebid 1NT--when you have a perfactly good rebid in hearts available|pg||
nt|idc: 2@c is transfer to @d I think, but some other hand types too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, gazzilli - 2@C is natural or any 16+|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, my mistake|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt after means bal 15/17|pg||
pc|h6|nt|justin c: this looks difficult|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  4, East opened 3@C not 1@C and the 4441 20HCP South hand could not go plus.  4@D-1.  5IMP to WBU|pg||
nt|dagold: moderately normal= middle of the road, normal for some not for all|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@S showed 4/4M exactly|pg||
nt|dagold: with 4/% he would bid 3@H|pg||
nt|dagold: 4/5|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean|pg||
nt|dagold: allowing Espen to bid 3@S if he had 4 of them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is positive relais, means 7+hcp|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bt: can discard a sapde and a club, what next|pg||
nt|diana1: they are obviously playing transfer responses to 1@c here and the 1@s bid denies 3@hs |pg||
nt|paulg:  not so obvious I'm afraid|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@ss rather|pg||
nt|justin c: there are preemptive raises, and preemptive raises|pg||
nt|justin c: not a bad idea to give p a clue what is happening|pg||
nt|justin c: for instance, he has 18-19 bal, and needs to know whether to bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs asking - 1@C showed 3+ @C|pg||

nt|djneill:  maybe @sJ or @cQ if lucky|pg||
nt|justin c: @H10 i think|pg||
nt|justin c: planning on forcing the S hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  @h would kill a red squeeze against East in some situations (@hA is communication)|pg||
nt|justin c: playing in @H, can isolate the @S threat, but not here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  1@h shows any 12+ and 1@s shows 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|diana1: I know that David and Rex in the other room do |pg||
nt|paulg:  then 2@h is a transfer to spades followed by invitational 2NT|pg||
nt|diana1: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: some work needed here|pg||
nt|paulg:  this would not be a good hand for lead of 10 showing 0 or 2 higher honours|pg||
nt|lestergold: this looks ,lioke it gives an extra trick but its still 9 tricks on any lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bt: spade|pg||
nt|garnetts: here endeth the squeeze |pg||
nt|rmb1: If South played @D7 would East find the 8?|pg||
nt|garnetts: west can now take care of the diamonds --the J@D was a little naive as no one would really lead from a Q against 6NT |pg||
nt|rmb1: ... and declarer could always postpone @D finesse|pg||
nt|justin c: needed to win @DK keeping @DJ in dummy, then cross in @C and play @S off|pg||
nt|justin c: W must duck it|pg||
nt|rmb1: I hate to say this (again) but isn't declare thinking a trick too late|pg||
pc|cK|nt|toobad: 3h denies a d control|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|rmb1: tempting to duck to not rectify the count|pg||
nt|justin c: then cash many winners, and endplay West or drop the @DQ, depending on his choice of discard|pg||
nt|peachy: CAMROSE live running scores http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|paulg:  okay, even better|pg||
nt|justin c: this needs him to read the position in the ending, but if the @D2 was 4th highest, should get it right|pg||
nt|dagold: only if they cash out|pg||
pc|c5|nt|garnetts: aK of clubs and then hearts?  |pg||
nt|dagold: which is tricky|pg||
nt|lestergold: providing of ocurse n/s cash their @ds now|pg||
nt|lestergold: whioch is not obvious|pg||
nt|dagold: if south had the diamond T a diamond switch would even beat it|pg||
nt|dagold: so he probably should|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing much else to try for|pg||
nt|lestergold: Tedd cant be certain of the urgency here|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like 3@H tricks|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@C|pg||
nt|dagold: tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: now 4 @D are good for N/S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: well when the auction looks confident I was always told to attack--and for the record I hate leading a random doubleton |pg||
nt|bridge_one: can lose this 3Nt|pg||
nt|daman: given there is only one way to play the hand this should go quickly|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make 3nt also with K@S in East|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not so loud:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dagold: and likely some number of spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has found it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so he can try 6@C |pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bt: i think so too, lol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because S and C are controlled only by West|pg||

pc|h4|pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: 10 @C ...|pg||

nt|paulg:  no problems for the defence now|pg||

pc|s7|nt|bt: if you are going to finesse, does it hurt to cash 2 spades hmm|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless Lindsay ducks this|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzxz: he took out then put back @HA|pg||

nt|peachy: brisk IMP exchange in this second half, no pushes|pg||
nt|chick: I think the splinter killed it .. splintering a singleton A is usually a bad idea|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S by N, anyway|pg||
nt|rmb1: First they have to establish its their hand|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D opening promises 5-card D|pg||
nt|peachy: (unless 444-1)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: playing for finesse in @C need however to try, first, the @S ... no money for see if @S are 2/2|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT again|pg||
nt|justin c: how will this one go on a @S lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: who can resist overcalling against a strong club?  |pg||
nt|chick: Makes partner think you have a loser there|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 combined but e/w likelyyo outbid with @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: needs care on a spade lead |pg||
nt|justin c: 3 rounds of @D beats 4@S by S i think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg:  3@c is 9-12 HCP with 3 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1C is Polish - either weak balanced or strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I know--but it would have been a good time to try 1@H wouldn't it?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose that East was limited on last since he didnt open 1 club|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats true but it wasn't our system |pg||
nt|peachy: 11.5-14 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is play for 4@s as cards lie but i think part score will be all here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: It did not occur to me that North might double |pg||
nt|justin c: sorry not sure im right about that|pg||
nt|justin c: would have two pitches on @D |pg||
nt|rmb1: After @DQA, South discards a club on third diamond, and a club on @DK, and finesses for no club losers.  may not have the entries|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: E must have known he was giving up the chance of ever getting his A@h so he was relying on partner to have a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: needs to duck a @D to west |pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant -- cash two high spades first|pg||
nt|justin c: hope he can see how to beat this, I sure cant|pg||
nt|garnetts: this looks cast iron |pg||
pc|s7|nt|justin c: how does one do that?|pg||
nt|garnetts: my kind of play hand |pg||

pc|s4|nt|odysseus69: been in worse slams|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|garnetts: exactly--was being ironic |pg||
nt|peachy: 3D alerted, apparently re-transfer|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose 2N shows @D shortness?|pg||
nt|dagold: can just defend 3@C for 200|pg||
nt|lestergold: sell out wow|pg||
nt|dagold: who should bid on do you suggest?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|justin c: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w need to beat this|pg||
nt|dagold: neither hand is close to bidding 3@s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dagold: it is down 2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|diana1: the play here shouldnt be too difficult although no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Kx looks like a dead holding --so why bother---West might have re booted this and then the double really costs |pg||
nt|justin c: very speculative double|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He is lucky his @D K is a trick - or is he? If East held the ace 6@D would be making.|pg||
nt|garnetts: you get away with this to an extent when the opps forget to use the blue card |pg||
nt|dagold: trivially|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: calling slam it is made with @S 3/3|pg||
nt|peachy: well, perhaps not, no way for declarer to get the tenth|pg||
pc|c2|nt|greerm: Ian needs to play @H for 1 loser, with no clues?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|djneill:  South was hoping North could bid NT, maybe with Qxx, better sided|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|greerm: more natural to play first @H from the table which will mean 1 off|pg||
nt|paulg:  i can't see any|pg||
nt|peachy: their card does not go that far in continuations|pg||
nt|xenya: um -- i've been trying to work out how the defence can go wrong :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dagold: west can't double|pg||

nt|dagold: facing AQJxx spades and out|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|peachy: I would just assume 2NT was some sort of superaccept|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@c could easily be cold|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|diana1: so he can afford to throw a @s and a @h|pg||
nt|sheila a: Best defence is to cash A@s and then exit with a @c, but will S know that?|pg||
nt|justin c: will play @D from S twice, |pg||

nt|xenya: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hi Roger - do u know where find the CC of players ?|pg||

nt|idc: West hand an opening bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Nope, sry. Staffan will check it out...|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c shows diamonds, or a 5-card major with 4-card minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  they have been very solid since the accident on  22, probably give them confidence for the rest of the weekend|pg||
nt|chick: I'm not sure that S should have "super" accepted ... that @DK wasn't carrying it's weight and that left S with a measly 12|pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16|pg||
nt|dagold: I like 4@s|pg||

nt|garnetts: If I had been west it would have been 400 |pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont expect too much action by N/S|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will North bid?  They have been quite conservative.|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: or 4@H maybe|pg||
nt|garnetts: unless some oficious busybody tells me its not allowed these days |pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT 15-17|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to pass 4@s with west'shand|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|justin c: if W doubles that, you are in business|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: ty staffan|pg||
nt|justin c: Erichsen agrees with you, anyway|pg||
nt|justin c: we will find out if Selway does presently|pg||
nt|garnetts: so it appears --I am humbled :)  |pg||
nt|djneill:  Selway related to Soloway?|pg||
nt|justin c: easy to reflect with that N hand that you have a trick or two for a partner who can make 4@S without your help|pg||
nt|chick: I count a lot of losers here|pg||
nt|peachy: this cant make|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|dagold: North can redouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: now west has brought his goods to market at a low safe level no takers no trouble|pg||
nt|dagold: they may even miss game here|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has a perfect pressure preempt of 4@s|pg||
nt|dagold: if North thinks south is very weak|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  wow, that is a big pass by East|pg||
nt|sheila a: I guess most would play x as pass or correct by E in this situation?|pg||
nt|diana1: it really is - has to do something|pg||
nt|chick: 4 clubs, 2 hearts, maybe a diamond, and maybe a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Chris Dixon|pg||

nt|garnetts: Good morning Chris|pg||
nt|rmb1: Morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 2NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: takeout double here, will lead to 4@H by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: good barrage by NS |pg||
nt|garnetts: well does east absolutely promise four hearts?  I think not |pg||
nt|justin c: this 2@S should show a much weaker hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is feeble|pg||
mb|3N|nt|djneill:  West is feeling not bad about setting chances, for a little bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: that might deny 2@H in which case N will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes in these auctions someone just has to bid notrump even with Jxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: looks like he needs hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: good for england not that im biassed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: many pair use the open of 4@C, in first and second position, with long suit in ! closed and A or K out - here the advantage to play natural|pg||
nt|justin c: far be it|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT 20-21, a very obvious upgrade here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|greerm: i meant bid 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: same hand a heart less and spade more--what would you do?  |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  this is unlikely to take long|pg||
nt|justin c: @h can still be right in 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good point - double cannot guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: with short @H hand taking the @S force|pg||
nt|justin c: agreed, X covers a lot of ground|pg||
nt|justin c: not a lot else East can do with quite a lot of hands here|pg||
nt|dagold: not for the beauty of the game though!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: long suit in @H|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|justin c: personally, I am not wild about opening 2@C on hands like this|pg||
nt|djneill:  and there it went|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|chick: he can set up some hearts, but meanwhile the spades are going to be established for the defense, too|pg||

nt|diumraid: *** LIVE IN RUNNING CAMROSE SCORES *** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then "browse results" then 1o3.txt  ***|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|diana1: double is probably the best thing as he is happy enough if his partner passes or bids spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might not make either --needs accurate play |pg||
nt|justin c: both of Easts @H go no|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike the previous hand, this looks impregnable -- coffee time|pg||
pc|c5|nt|justin c: i think you need defensive strength too|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  given the carnage that may ensue, this is probably the safest spot for EW|pg||
nt|garnetts: unlucky if you venture into the five level |pg||
nt|bridge_one: terrible distribution !|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|djneill:  best defense is a good offense, so South has a lot of defense|pg||
nt|rmb1: No double - no trouble - just dript off|pg||
nt|lestergold: inexplicable to me at thism level|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chessmaste: The 4-1 heart break is a blow for declarer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He must now change tack |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sheila a: maybe he was worried that he had insufficient defence if partner was quite weak??|pg||
nt|justin c: outvoted as usual :)|pg||
nt|justin c: problem one, north has no idea when he should bid on over 4@S here|pg||
nt|rmb1: - *drift* off|pg||
nt|lestergold: the man has 7 tricks in his own hand qan hism partner redoubled |pg||
pc|h6|nt|garnetts: The late John Collins first used this idea--and i thought he was right when I first saw it and still do |pg||
nt|idc: I guess E-W play 1NT forcing, otherwise West would pass|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|justin c: i think norths pass was fair enough|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: that will mean he gets the @D length right though--so a @D to the K --simply play the k@D first then lead towards  the ace |pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  except opponents are already limited, so can easily be your hand|pg||

mb|1H|nt|djneill:  West could have had this hand the previous board, given South's 2@c opening theorty|pg||
nt|justin c: slam excellent if N had @HK and a minor suit A|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not easy call this slam :)|pg||
nt|idc: If N-S compete in clubs, it may even help E-W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C by East can help also|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I was thinking weak two |pg||
nt|justin c: rather than his actual @DK @CA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after pass north i means|pg||
nt|idc: East knows they are playing with a 30 point pack, and if he trusts vulnerable opponents partner may not have too much wasted in clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: 3-way club: nat, 11-14 bal or 18-19 bal|pg||

nt|djneill:  no no, open 1@d, in case opps bid 4@s :-)|pg||
nt|peachy: Tedd had a way to show both majors, apparently we went with the Dbl (Assume penalty) instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  fewer will be in 2@s|pg||

nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|peachy: *he |pg||
nt|xenya: mirror hands, EW's -- never a good feature...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt i suppose raise with 4 cards, but can be weaker that Jacoby 2Nt|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@c= NF|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West now will be happy wothout one point in @C !|pg||
nt|idc: True Giorgio, pass by North would have allowed an even clearer 4@c by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: wonder what would have happened if S passed 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: This should be more straightforward|pg||
nt|paulg:  a quieter hand as everything behaves|pg||
nt|diana1: looks like an easy enough 4@hs especially as the @ds are breaking|pg||
nt|justin c: you have defensive stuff here, the oppo are vul|pg||
nt|chick: I thought X didn't describe his hand well at all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think not less of 6 now|pg||
nt|idc: East is still worried about trump quality, a fair enough worry|pg||
nt|idc: But West has a great hand and will go on for sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7 depending only by @H 3/2|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: this doesnt look too healthy|pg||
nt|dagold: no but Espen had to try it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|justin c: nothing v appealing for W to do|pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: Just out of curiosity waht would an initial 3@S show?  |pg||
nt|djneill:  true|pg||
nt|peachy: well, he has it set in his own hand but only 1 trick|pg||
nt|peachy: by one trick|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, and vul with a hand like that, I'd want to be declaring|pg||
nt|peachy: I have to admit I would have started describing my hand|pg||
nt|justin c: seems kind of inevitable, doesnt it|pg||
nt|lestergold: im nopt sure of e/wbidding system ie as to their minimum requirements for a 2/1 response|pg||
nt|dagold: their 2/1 is FG unless the suit is rebid|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean he may expect mopre than  7 points opposite??|pg||
pc|d3|nt|justin c: presumably a stronger hand than this|pg||
nt|garnetts: well actually the sequence 2@C 2@D 3@d is always difficult |pg||
nt|justin c: it is|pg||
nt|justin c: for many, this denies a M|pg||
nt|djneill:  East was not expecting to play this one|pg||
nt|peachy: with hearts splitting, declarer needed diamond guess|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|diablo666: West showing extra values with no short suit, a bid that shows a positive attitude towards life :) .|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only 1 key cards in East, perhaps better 4@S over 3@D (but i don't know what means 3@D, could be conventional bid)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I am not sure a simple 2@S is right on the East hand - maybe 3@S - unless they think that is weak|pg||
nt|garnetts: or weaker?  |pg||
nt|justin c: (using 2@C-2@D-3M as 4M and longer @D)|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen hoping for the Jacf of clubs or a side entry. Norman hoping for a couple of clubs oppisite|pg||
nt|justin c: if E could have an 11 count and bid the same way, seems tough for W to know what to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c so if its rebid the hand can be as weak as this?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S correct (better that 4nt)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: finesse|pg||
pc|dK|nt|greerm: standard lead with 5 trumps |pg||
nt|chick: this should make, draw trump, ruff the 3rd heart, then pitch diamonds on hearts, ruff the 3rd diamond|pg||
pc|d8|nt|justin c: hope to drop the @CJ10|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with Mark here--I like 3@S to be this hand type--no point in pre-empting with 3@S |pg||
nt|justin c: i dont know the EW bidding methods here|pg||
nt|justin c: but i think that 3@S would be a strong 1 suiter|pg||
nt|justin c: question is whether this is 'strong'|pg||
nt|justin c: it is if your p promises to produce the @SK and an A|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The other question you need to ask is if I bid 2@S will partner pass on many hands where we have a play for game?|pg||
nt|justin c: y, was wondering what, if anything, West would do if S had passed|pg||
nt|justin c: of the first 7 boards, 6 were flat|pg||
nt|justin c: slam decent here for EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 5@h now isn't my preferred option|pg||
nt|daman: would it guarantee a @C control?|pg||
nt|daman: 5@D?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably East would choose 5@C to give the void|pg||
nt|idc: Perhaps West worried that 4@c could be general slam try and not for sure a control?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: 3@D 14/15 no shortness (this inf., by kibitz, so TY :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yup--that is why I do not like 2@S |pg||
nt|daman: 5@D should guarantee a @C control I would think|pg||
nt|idc: but surely East wouldn't slam try with Ax Jxxx KQxxx xx ?|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East could bid 5@C, but also 4nt RKBW - 5@D weaker|pg||
nt|peachy: but now it is over|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: only small hope|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Whenever West has modest spades he will be likley to pass, even with decent high card strength.|pg||
nt|garnetts: There was a case for a penalty double of 3@H --but usually you cannot do that as west |pg||
nt|chick: only works because trumps split|pg||
nt|justin c: dont think he will be too bothered by this - surely flat board|pg||
nt|justin c: until i said that it was, anyway|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chessmaste: That is why I would be inclined to overcall 3@S - then partner does not have to worry so much about trump support|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean it means somehting else like a game try in spades |pg||
nt|dagold: AK to seven and a stiff spade I'd rather overbid with 2@c than bid 1N|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: that was needed --good switch |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 4@C sure control in @C - but can be sgl ...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dagold: if you hit a fit the hand is very good|pg||
nt|xenya: he always loses 2 diamonds -- and 2 more tricks|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|diana1: it will be interesting to see what happens on Board 8 in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: in some systems u respond 1N and then rebid 3@c to ask partner to put dummy down|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahh: certainly been an interesting set to watch :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trick is to avoid the spade fit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahh: just bid 3nt then |pg||
nt|ahh: like bd 21 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT will get a spade lead if West does not mention them, but he will|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|idc: Ok, deep finesse says 3NT can't be made last hand, just a wild shot in the dark|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahh: are we about to see Smolen |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: no |pg||
nt|3for3: no west went low it appears|pg||
nt|3for3: perhaps 2@S is invite, a common treatment these days|pg||
mb|4S|nt|3for3: East thinking means it was :)|pg||
nt|ahh: :) very inviting |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think the double is unwise, but ....|pg||
nt|ahh: now he will play trumps well |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahh: pity he didnt use smolen then south on lead with @C ace |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: He may be able to get 100 instead of 50, but is it worth it if the gives the show away?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|3for3: true, but is the pitch useful?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sometimes they make because you double|pg||
nt|ahh: losing @D will go |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|3for3: but after partner doubles, they will 'start' the spades the right way anyway|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, didn't see the @D loser|pg||
pc|d7|nt|idc: N-S will get @h + @c, so need two trump tricks, hard to see fewer or more|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahh: another reason not to double 4@S ever is seconds later opps may bid 7 of a minor making |pg||
nt|3for3: lol|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahh: called doing a Fredin |pg||
nt|idc: I'm guessing there's a story behind that one Jim?|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, I think I remember it now|pg||
nt|3for3: i am sure fredin does :)|pg||
nt|ahh: at least here he knew he had 7@C covered |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He doubled 4@S with AKJ10xx. He was right, 4@D could not make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|idc: Wales still hammering Ireland, so the latter have lost the lead to England|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was against Germany at the Europeans|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|s7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Moments later the Germans had wriggled their way to 7@C|pg||

nt|sheila a: I see Scotland failed to make 4@s on board 8 so it's a gain to Northern Ireland|pg||
nt|diana1: so Board 8 where Charles went one off in 4@h their other pair went one off in 4@s|pg||
nt|greerm: yet another 2 suiter|pg||
nt|paulg:  3 of them!|pg||
nt|greerm: squared|pg||
nt|justin c: possible 3NT for EW, but not easy to get there|pg||
nt|garnetts: Just to be perverse I like 3@H here 6-4 shapes usually play well |pg||
nt|djneill:  East 1@d?|pg||
nt|justin c: sick|pg||
nt|garnetts: it can be beaten on a spade lead or A@D and a switch |pg||
nt|garnetts: but like low @D and then nine tricks |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS can make 7@h but you do not wnat to be in it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be expensive|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen's heart carding clearly asked for a club|pg||
nt|idc: another boring 4@s we'd say, if we only saw N-S cards|pg||
mb|1N|nt|diana1: so a small double swing|pg||
nt|peachy: EW play light initial actions but this too light for even them|pg||
nt|lestergold: thism sortm of signal / carding is so often missed even at international level|pg||
nt|dagold: I don't agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it was here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and ive seenit before|pg||
nt|dagold: I think that was an unusual error for that type of situation|pg||
nt|xenya: um -- strange W cashed the @DQ -- he knew N would be endplayed at that point|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: who will get his spake in first?|pg||
nt|xenya: for 8 tricks|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|paulg:  smallest possible|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@H now, michaels or ghestem|pg||
nt|greerm: east doesn't mind with 5@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  michaels|pg||
nt|garnetts: too strong maybe |pg||
nt|dagold: am sure there will be some stern words from Espen|pg||
nt|lestergold: well you are right to be harsh on Selway he shoudl have got it right|pg||
nt|idc: I guess diamond ruffs so likely that 4 is a bit pushy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: almost impossible to stop before 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  everyone was sick they passed out|pg||
nt|idc: if North bids 2@s they might, but nowadays pairs *hate* to miss game with a sniff of a chance|pg||
nt|idc: Soon every bid will show support!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|justin c: oh dear|pg||
nt|idc: I blame Marty Bergen for starting the trend|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H could be   natural or 8/10 3 cards support in @S|pg||
nt|idc: The N-S CC regularly says "see front of card", but we don't have the front of card|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|greerm: West is pretty powerful now|pg||
nt|greerm: needs little but needs exact cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless his partner has the @dA, would need to discard partner's hearts on his clubs|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2NT without a stopper is ambitious|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also agree with 2NT--even though it might well not work out well here|pg||
nt|justin c: hard to like double with the south cards|pg||
mb|4S|nt|idc: But I'm guessing 2@h is a constructive raise to 2@s (perhaps with alternative meanings too)|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: now Ian must guess that his void isn't working|pg||
nt|toobad: hard not to make a try|pg||
nt|justin c: @S ruff beats 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisdixon:  EW hands fit well here and it looks as if 10 tricks might be made - although a clubb lead and spade switch would defeat game|pg||
nt|justin c: but game not at all bad lookings at the EW cards alone|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Many ways to raise hearts in this hand, I would have chosen a more descriptive one, either splinter or bid 1S to look for doublefit|pg||
nt|ahh: at least we found out that this a game forcing auction     for east  west that was |pg||
nt|daman: not easy to beat|pg||
nt|daman: A and anpther trump would be helpful|pg||
nt|idc: E-W aren't going to be talked out of their game, though perhaps going minus is a price too high to pay|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: maybe 3@H says I do not have a real stop --they can then grope |pg||
nt|garnetts: I have played that myself |pg||
nt|justin c: even after an indecently thorough grope, nowhere to go|pg||
nt|garnetts: it does--but NS were wise to let this one go--a spade lead or switch is essential |pg||
nt|idc: Ah, welcome young Jim|pg||
nt|ahh: evening all |pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  this looks very normal and the fortunate spade and club positions means that it will always make|pg||
nt|greerm: 5@C is 0/3 I presume|pg||
nt|garnetts: west might not lead a heart--but he shoudl because he has nothing else much |pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  and the fortunate diamond position|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  I am surprised that Mike Tedd remained silent throughout here|pg||
nt|justin c: according to the card, 1NT is "11.5 to 13.5 in principle"|pg||
nt|justin c: make of that what you will|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|diana1: so this lead lets him get rid of his @s loser|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I expect it will be flat across the event|pg||
nt|diana1: yes probably|pg||
nt|paulg:  the North hand has no entry to cash the spade|pg||
nt|toobad: yes|pg||
nt|greerm: key lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: not the best sequence of bids I have ever seen |pg||
nt|lestergold: helpful lead no problems here |pg||
nt|xenya: don't think this can be made, even double dummy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|greerm: off now, i think ok on any other lead but suppose @HK natural|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: but likely to make |pg||
pc|d8|nt|yorkbeach:  NS play 3@c as a mini splinter|pg||
nt|dagold: on the second heart, with 2 remaining the top card is the normal play as it is standard remaining count. the lower card is a strong message about the lower ranking suit|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Jim|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: can afford to give up 2 clubs|pg||
nt|idc: That's the sort of dummy that you put down and the other 3 players all clean their glasses and stare at a second time|pg||
nt|xenya: um -- maybe now...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|justin c: suppose he might double 2@H on the way out|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes and I am also suprised that South did not try 3@C in the pass out seat |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|paulg:  considering that the hands are quite exciting and interesting, the imp score is very low|pg||
nt|garnetts: you might settle for 3@S --an intial double is not a panacea|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bridge_one: better @D ruff and @C from dummy|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chrisdixon:  He was not in the pass out seat|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dagold: so the higher card is neutral or asking for higher|pg||
nt|justin c: @D now, dec clears @C, another @D|pg||
nt|justin c: 1 off|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: if east hekld both clubs and west the spade holding as dealt then contract would be under threat|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dagold: can be important to have a neutral carding order so that partner does not think you are signalling something everytime you follow suit|pg||
nt|idc: North is remembering the advice Ken Baxter used to give: don't rush to win a trick until you know what you will do next|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: a smooth duck was needed |pg||
nt|garnetts: thats why then :) |pg||
nt|garnetts: teach me to multi task |pg||
nt|rmb1: On  9 England avoided slam +11IMP|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: but u cant cater for everything|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, they didn't have splinter available, as minisplinter less points, and 4C would have shown void|pg||
nt|peachy: is that correct Julian|pg||
nt|ahh: great advice |pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: ooops|pg||
pc|d2|nt|greerm: Needs a revoke now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  @hK natural but diamond lead could have been the killer|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sheila a: I was just checking the play in 4@S on board 8. West had no entry so @s had to be played from the big hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|paulg:  but John Matheson has played a lot more bridge than I and normally gets these right|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|sheila a: declarer guessed wrong which honour was doubleton|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|daman: you would think that NS could see what was coming and played trumps|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idc: It does feel a bit like a hand to cut down a crossruff|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S must play @h before ... it is a classical cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahh: often hard to get defence back on track  fixed ideas hard to shift |pg||
nt|daman: it's too late now|pg||
nt|ahh: time for thinking long past|pg||
nt|idc: And once declarer had shown out of spades and played @dAK, fairly clear cut, but I guess Jim's comment is the pertinent one|pg||
nt|xenya: had he tried the @SK first, he would have made it i think|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|paulg:  less likely to bid slam after a 1@c opening|pg||

nt|justin c: 10 imps to england when a @S was led against 4@H from @SKJxx|pg||
nt|justin c: (the one where a @S went on the @CA if you didnt cash @S immediately)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think it was a well deserved swing then |pg||
nt|justin c: he could make that by making first @C play from dummy, but on actual line was beatable|pg||
nt|lestergold: how?|pg||
nt|justin c: West has likes his chances of beating 4@S|pg||
nt|ahh: i think when north held cards in 3 side suits and had 3 trumps better to lead trump |pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  solid opener from Vi Outred that shows a limited hand with either clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for NI in the Open Room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sheila a: are you thinking of 1@d, Paul?|pg||
nt|paulg:  oh, she's decided it is 11-13 balanced ... which of course it is|pg||
nt|diana1: 3NT was missed in the other room with NS playing in 3@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think Matheson and Sime will bid the slam|pg||
nt|toobad: it would be a stretch |pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16|pg||
nt|rmb1: On previous form South will not open 4@C as Crouch did|pg||
nt|justin c: on previous, East needed to continue @D rather than blowing a @H trick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  even more solid then|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@S anyone?|pg||
nt|paulg:  3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|toobad: fit jump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@s showing a 3-card limit raise is very popular with the 5-card majorites here|pg||
nt|garnetts: we do try to argue for leads we really would make and not just those that work when we can see all of the hands |pg||
nt|garnetts: should be totally flat in 4@S |pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  AN inspired defence would beat 4@H here|pg||
nt|garnetts: they made 11 in hearts next door--spades are to be avoided |pg||
nt|lestergold: and a tempo|pg||
nt|dagold: being conservative here will work for NS|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here 4@s down, 4@H down, , ,|pg||
nt|ahh: south hand an opener for lots of modern pairs |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D down|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  very hard to bid 3NT when the opposition show hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: is everybody playing transfers?|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 2@C = 4@H and another, or 5+@H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|justin c: 2@S = @H and another|pg||
pc|d8|nt|greerm: 13 imps to NI|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D trying to play in the side suit, if there is one|pg||
nt|lestergold: having opened minimum south only has sufficent to invite game in @ss|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@C p/c|pg||
nt|idc: Two bits of good news for Scottish supporters: 1) Other room had a possible good result on final board and|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  the double showed 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|garnetts: blimey |pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  South should surely double 4@H|pg||
nt|diumraid: *** Live Overall Scores - CAMROSE *** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then "browse results" then 1o3.txt  *****|pg||
nt|rmb1: If South doubled would that be lightner|pg||
nt|bridge_one: why not 3@s over the dbl, having Qx in @C ?|pg||
nt|ahh: he might get trumps right after the preempt |pg||
nt|idc: 2) soon there will be no more boards this half of the match|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|justin c: potentially @S ruff, @C underlead, @S ruff, @D|pg||
nt|garnetts: How realistic is a spade lead?  |pg||
nt|dagold: might get 300 if north passes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|justin c: 2@H, just @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@C appears to mean I have a long suit somewhere |pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  QUite likely after a double|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sheila a: the auction does kind of suggest @h are 4-4|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless 1@d was a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: 1@d might have been a sort of responsive double|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, or just denying a 5-card major?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Vi wondering if there are 9 on top|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd be wondering if there are 7 on top|pg||
nt|sheila a: Charles has bid quite strongly but clearly there were other, stronger bids he could have made|pg||
nt|diana1: as you said before Paul it is easy when we can see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  if there is one leading style I abhor, then it is MUD in partner's suit|pg||
nt|djneill:  bravo lead!|pg||
nt|justin c: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think correct also 4@S fit showing|pg||
nt|daman: EW will still get their @D ruff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with Chris--a double to suggest a void--|pg||
nt|lestergold: wales have achance to recoup a few imps|pg||
nt|dagold: has south shown spades?|pg||
nt|dagold: must have done for north to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen may double this|pg||
nt|dagold: and may not beat it|pg||
nt|lestergold: support doubke perhaps on first round?|pg||
nt|lestergold: in efect|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps but that is an unusual agreement|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think first double should show spade support|pg||
nt|justin c: i would have thought X was values, penalty oriented|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|justin c: @S leads here?|pg||
nt|justin c: (3@H with game invitation in @S perhaps)|pg||
nt|dagold: depends on how you agree it|pg||
nt|dagold: good pass by Espen|pg||
nt|justin c: they seem to be on the same page, anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: second double was pneal;ties sure|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  a lot depends on what the redouble showed .. it may have been diamonds or a range|pg||
nt|garnetts: that double is far too agressive in my view although it might work |pg||
nt|garnetts: if you are going to lead that then double |pg||
nt|djneill:  same at other table :(|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Frank :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: are 9 tricks guaranteed here i dont think 3@s is all chopped liver|pg||
nt|dagold: not guaranteed|pg||
nt|dagold: but makeable|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|toobad: me too....here here!!|pg||
nt|idc: oops, needed to cash 2nd @d first|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sheila a: I was going more by the fact that he came again at the 3 level vul|pg||
nt|justin c: has worked a charm|pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: good lead, maybe by default but still good. Dont want to lead or underlead ace, and dont want to lead singleton trump|pg||

pc|h9|nt|daman: yes   @C   @C   then @D|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well making gaijns 8 imps 1 off gains 3|pg||
nt|dagold: good judgement by Espen|pg||
pc|sA|nt|justin c: @S2 lead maybe then|pg||
pc|s6|nt|djneill:  guess just did not want to do anything rash, so backed into it|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dagold: i think to make he had to avoid trumps altogether|pg||
pc|s3|nt|justin c: was about to say that they can get two @S ruffs|pg||
nt|justin c: more imps to England for reaching 4@S where S had 7 solid|pg||
nt|lestergold: on bidding he should have expected at least 4/1 break withc 5/0 a possibility|pg||
nt|justin c: Liggins opened that hand at the 1 level, as here, but then rebid 3@S, which got the job done|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Nice because ...?|pg||

nt|galadriel: Do you still prefer weak NT Ian?|pg||

nt|paulg:  In the other matches, England lead Ireland 59-54 imps and Wales lead the WBU (Wales II) by 45-41 imps|pg||
nt|toobad: 3nt?|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  You have to alert partner to an unusual lead here - you just need him to have 1 entry|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Opportunity missed, I feel.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well wales had chanc e to gain 11 imps on that board and only gained 3|pg||
nt|ahh: most important time to be in lead in tight match ?  after last board |pg||
mb|1H|nt|diana1: not much breaking well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 12 imps to wales on the one where it went 1@D-4@S-5@D-X here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sheila a: NS likely to bid 3NT and likely to be disappointed|pg||
nt|paulg:  The schedule restart is in 30 minutes, 21:50 GMT|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT looks set fair |pg||
nt|garnetts: 10 tricks in 3NT looks excessive until you look at the nice friendly layout |pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Here is a more routine 4@H|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last hand.  Thanks to David, Justin and Chris.  Thanks to the operator and to CBAI and BBO.  Second half of this match starts at 12:20 GMT|pg||
nt|lestergold: they cannot afford to pass up such chances|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thx all for watching !|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: in the other room, 1@D-4@S, all out|pg||
nt|peachy: last hand coming up. Thanks all. http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php schedule for more vugraph, all times are local to you.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|justin c: (rather improbably)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I certainly agree--seems to me you have a duty to tell partner somehting useful--random to pass--rather lack of engagement |pg||
nt|rmb1: ... in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl probably A or K in @s (for the lead)|pg||
nt|idc: As you can see, in other room Walker sitting West took a flier at 3NT and it worked (with a fair bit of luck)|pg||
nt|ahh: unlikely 3nt will be bid now |pg||

nt|lestergold: what is this??|pg||
nt|dagold: why did 3@s make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I like the negative redouble here as east promising 0 or 1 in partner's suit--pass and double with balanced values |pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C looks like a transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: hearts break spades on  side -not reall problems in 3NT|pg||
nt|dagold: wasn't it one off at the end?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: 1@d is unbal with either minor, 1NT is a game force|pg||
nt|bridge_one: surprise|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: West must be considering slam possibilities|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does south have tio hold to bid over 3@h|pg||
nt|xenya: last board for today -- thanks everyone|pg||
pc|s2|nt|toobad: D or S?|pg||
nt|greerm: no reason to think of a @D|pg||
nt|greerm: hard to see how this will make, but 8 tricks there so....|pg||
nt|toobad: needs help|pg||
nt|greerm: defence might let him set up a @H trick ?|pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|justin c: very fair, not set|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rmb1: NS play four card majors (not come up before in this set)|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like the slam hand has made the difference this set|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks Vladimir and Thanks our excellent operator|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg:  the defence has to be quite careful to beat this I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normal lead normal contract J@H normal play @C to the Q--then we can all go back to sleep for a while |pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this auction can be usefull to have the possibility to bid 3@D with good long suit, not depending on points|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|greerm: North will have to find the @D suit soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: i admit he is minimum but he cannot pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: no|pg||
nt|ahh: credit the 2nt bid in the other room  rather than redouble perhaps  its pushy too |pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  needs to switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am truly amazed that West passed 4@S in the OR--must have failed to pay an entry fee |pg||
nt|dagold: north had a double too as a passed hand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: 1 0ff means they gain 3 imps|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|greerm: home now|pg||
nt|garnetts: the "@D bid did not have much appeal to be honest and anyway south has ignored it |pg||
nt|peachy: 1C was 11-13 balanced, or any 17+|pg||
nt|chick: looks like the same 11 tricks|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  He can take two @S finesses and end up with 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  in some relay systems south would have shown nothing about her hand on this auction|pg||
nt|paulg:  and it would do her no good at all this time|pg||
nt|sheila a: Unless West is put off leading a @s and tries a @c ...|pg||
nt|chick: especially with that lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chessmaste: That was a good (inspired?) decision by North to pass 3@H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|justin c: this is the last board of this set|pg||
nt|justin c: many thanks all|pg||
nt|garnetts: lthanks all  |pg||
nt|justin c: and we restart at 15.10 (in theory)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT is interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: thank you Raija|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also 2nt by East is more effective|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sheila a: Scotland edge into the lead thanks to a tiny swing on the awkward board 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: but had they played 3 clubs doubnoled 2 off tghey would have gained 11|pg||
pc|s6|nt|greerm: missed the "obvious " squeez that we can see|pg||
nt|garnetts: totally agree--North seems to be agressive mostly then suddenly makes a very conservative pass |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|garnetts: j@S is the right card |pg||
nt|garnetts: In case partner has AQ10x|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|toobad: Rex and David are bidding them up in the open room|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  10, South played 4@S got a diamond lead and the defence got their ruff but declarer disposed of his club losers as we thought might be possible|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rmb1: ... 4@S= only 1IMP to Wales|pg||
nt|justin c: low scoring set of boards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|justin c: if the slam hand went the other way, v big difference|pg||
nt|peachy: For more viewing pleasure, here is the schedule for upcoming vugraphs, all times local to you http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: it looks difficuolt but it made so more imps to england|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|peachy: running scores here http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chessmaste: Still, South did not bid 2@S which would have shown a strong raise, so he knew the dummy would be modest|pg||
nt|garnetts: ttfn |pg||
nt|idc: true, a negative dbl seemed automatic to me but the difference in suit qualities (@h & @s) perhaps means 2NT is superior|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sheila a: hard to see any more than 7 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|diana1: the EW played in 3@c-2|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@c-1|pg||
nt|sheila a: Sime judged to pass the W hand over 1NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: which made things simpler|pg||
nt|paulg:  if Vi takes theis and plays a spade, then West may feel it is necessary to cash @cA for down one|pg||
nt|paulg:  or even ducks|pg||
nt|dagold: that was very soft by NS|pg||
nt|dagold: both hands had a bid|pg||
nt|justin c: thats all folks|pg||
nt|dagold: bye|pg||
nt|justin c: restart at 2.55 |pg||
nt|lestergold: bye and thx to my fellow commentators well played england|pg||
nt|bridge_one: when is rare to penalty opps, better to choose the bid more effective - 2nt was very ok bey east|pg||
