mb|1H|mb|2H!|nt|tomi2: its just ana agreement I have with some partners. with nat nonforcing I simply lead a club vs 1nt and with a good hand I double and lead a club|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|tomi2: they will end up in 3NT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1@D  ;   1NT   18-20  ?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the other room made 3NT without @S stopper|pg||

nt|juror1: Buongiorno Giorgio|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello Slawek :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphp2: sorry for problems, Kalita played 7 of spade the result is -3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, lead a card and claim|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @SA was led which blocked the suit, small @S would be -1|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  danger!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, not, if 3nt was alerted|pg||
nt|tomi2: Tuszynski - Kowalski have been playing together for many years, I bet they know their follow-ups to multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree with pass by West - the DBL means only points, for sure not long @h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C would be forced|pg||
nt|nagini: he will manage:)|pg||
nt|vbman: so 1 nt is weak?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Nige Kearney|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nigel|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this contract is much safer|pg||
nt|vbman: or 15-17?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14 balanced hands are opened 1@C|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  N knows partner has maximum hand with @h|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tomi2: west will need to decide what ace partner has|pg||
nt|vbman: and the rebid after 1 red suit is?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: passed hoping in 2 @s tricks - difficult to think North void in @S !|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 12-14 they start a "rescue" sequence and try to find a ceah major fit before 1NT|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|nagini: only nuclear weapon against this transfers:)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: But you bid a major over 1@D (0-7) if you have 12-14. Can be 3 cards|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|nagini: on this level they rarely bid without a reason|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is not natural. it may include "any 0-6 hand"|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  next time it does no harm, but now E has the lead as described in a bridge book|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|tomi2: E/W are members of the Polish seniors team, having won lots of medals in the last years|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And N-S play for Lithuania|pg||
nt|tomi2: Lasocki used to be a top player in the 80's and 90's playing with Gawrys|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: at all level it is possible dont guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: ah yesss|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tomi2: North is a sponsor from Lithuania who plays in Poland very often|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|tomi2: 3@D is probably invitational. North has support a single but minimum and no aces. this time 3@D is the best spot for them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably they use DBL for @h and 1@h for @S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vbman: so there is no mistake in saying that poland is one of the top nations of bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: happy Appy:)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the xfer at 1 level it is usefull to receive the lead from tha hand with points|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: well done finding the 5-3 fit in the 4th suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: here you see the reason why support doubles were invented originally. I read somewhere that Rodwell was also fan of bidding 3 card suits if there is no other good bid available and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: he did not like to play in 3-3 fits when partner raised him with 3 cards in competive situations|pg||
pc|d6|nt|juror1: welcome Tezcan Sen of Turkey|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nigel_k:  Opposite a weak NT game is unlikely and Qxx in opponents suit is bad|pg||
nt|vbman: can bridge teaching supply a living in europe?|pg||
nt|tomi2: remember, this is the Polish Premiere LEague, so it starts with a round robin event, but they will play KO matches afterwards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poland keep recruiting new players through hard work by a lot of people. The Polish junior players are extremely good, and they have lots of them|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: yes, especialy in Germany, we have lots of wealthy old people playing Bridge in their local clubs, who want to be better then their friends|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's our point of view|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D should not be some slamtry, both players were limited and made a non forcing bid to start with|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, 5@d might be only one down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: possible to make game here having Ax in both suit|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42: friendly @c break sees this home|pg||
nt|othered1: with everything very friendly from this point, GIB (who peeks) would likely make an overtrick.  Here, though, declarer is looking for the safest line for 4. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now easy to make 10 tricks, because A in @C must be in West, so small @C from dummy|pg||
mc|9|nt|vbman: l also very much appreciate the german national team|pg||

nt|tomi2: 2@S by Vainikonis tends to promise 5 spades in Poland|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello everyone!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duking the D risk Q@D @d ruff losing after the K@D|pg||
nt|vbman: taking the low road resulted well|pg||
nt|vbman: if they played in nt it wd be a 15 point difference|pg||
nt|vbman: operator what are ns talking now?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nagini: felt it|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tez: my asistant says ''we say "side suit first" :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most of the breaks will be because most Polish players smoke - so they need a short time in such 12 board matches|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tomi2: even if he went down it would gain lots of imps since NS made 4@S over there|pg||
nt|pfbr: "assistant" :)|pg||
nt|nagini: personally I would choose  pepsi a pd|pg||
nt|vbman: smoking kills|pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: in vuln normal 3@h opening|pg||
nt|nagini: one condition only: as my sponsor:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: light openung|pg||
mb|3H|nt|tomi2: the best movement for the players was "4-board BAM swiss" so they had to wait for the other results and couls smore every 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: players was talking about previous board|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think with wests hand you should not force your partnership to the 5th level if you start the match leading in the 25 VP margin|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nagini: pepsi has a feeling in fingers:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad controls isnt worth 12|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but I by today's standards, it's pretty sound -- a couple of 10's, and a couple of honor tricks make up for the acelessness.|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, if you can get them to take a phantom save, vul, it does have its merits.|pg||
nt|tomi2: you already need a good dummy to cause s relative flat score compared to passing 4@H with those two major aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: good correction to 5@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if partner cannot open 2@S, probably the suit is insufficient|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@D of course is multi - long @h or @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: if 4@H was making you need to escape for -3 maximum to have a relatively flat board|pg||
nt|tomi2: while you need a huge dummy to turn a bad baord into a good one - but this will not bring you more VP tan you already have|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: but it riscs going down more or going down while 4@H was not making - in those scenarios you lose imps. so IMO bidding can win very seldom but lose very often|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tomi2: the players don't know the running score but they know the score after 12 boards|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|othered1: Effective double by north.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be worried about @C now|pg||
nt|othered1: He can hold this to -1 with the right view on the minor suit positions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but might take a wrong view on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is to give the A in @D - cab be usefull for the lead|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s5|nt|tomi2: and they already had one board where they might expect to win imps and one where they might lose, wo it was not unlikely that the result was still 25-x at that point|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|othered1: Agree.  I wonder if the lead will give him an idea of the shape of the hand.|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|vbman: so does anyone think the current score must be told to the players?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: not ruffing high is a pretty extreme position here|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this will be tough to get right ruff high and double finesse|pg||

nt|Gerben42: another big swing to Unia|pg||
nt|othered1: Compared to the auction in the othe room, the one here looks perfectly normal.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or was the ugly 1N opening very specialized?|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Gerben42: a weak one I guess|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: when @HK wins your problem is gone: @DA draw @H and run @C|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: you have all intermediates|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: 33 points on EW but no slam as far as I can see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably rdbl have another means (not A @D)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but made in CR|pg||
nt|tomi2: again some "Hamman" 3NT try, this time stopped by west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nagini: wow|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nagini: as smart as pepsi?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
nt|vbman: push board|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: am quite suprised that Russian did not bid 2@D after 1@S - that is a GF relay promising at least 3 card support in @S and enough for game|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
nt|tomi2: skipping the 2@D relay often indicates a) not such good 3 card support and/or b) a better heart suit|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this to give the possibility to defend knowing a minimum of 3 cards |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|tez: is it real or need undo|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: at first trick W small dimond and E 8 od dimond|pg||

nt|Gerben42: perhaps they will show their 1@C 1N system again|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@h probably down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in the previous hand|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No ideal bid for Kalita here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess one has double although that would indicate four spades|pg||
nt|tomi2: he could cash @S before to have 9 tricks for sure and finesse later or catch the singleton queen and play @S10 and then the other spades|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: here 4@S ON also with A@C and @C lead because opener will play A@S and @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = 3 cards raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  that was the way, yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 3@H with 4cards raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is limit +|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tez: @c leads beat 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|nigel_k:  Some pairs play that double shows spades and 1@s denies them|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No game makes for N-S but that's because South has no opener (in my view)|pg||
nt|nagini: sped for to be down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Otherwise hands like North have no good bid|pg||
nt|nagini: nmf|pg||
mb|2S|nt|frankaus: agree - only 25 zars - do u like zars  - i'm a fan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like popcorn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: zars the same as smarties?|pg||
nt|frankaus: zar's hand evalution system  - link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I stick to the 4321 scale but I am no fan. It is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|tomi2: Let me try to introduce the format they are playing here. This is the Polish Premiere League. 16 Teams play a compleate round robin on thwo weekends, so they will finish sunday but ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: then the "fun" will start. The field will be torn into groups of 4 - basicly its most important to be top 8 after sunday|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: but we are sure he will lead @d ace or @s ace|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tez: normal lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a kinitz told me 2NT is GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 2@C would be nmf. I guess they play some GF checkback or so|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: then the teams will play one "K-O" against teams from their group, the first 8 may still become Champions, the last 8 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
nt|tomi2: south just shows a balanced hand with 6 clubs and probably 3@S and not a good heart stop. interesting what north makes with those information havin 2 hearts only too|pg||
nt|tomi2: should Olanski do something here?|pg||
nt|nagini: gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C=any invit hand 2@D=any GF hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: take @c play @h first..you can make it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H = invite, 2Nt=GF both with raise in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a interesting option|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tomi2: playing this method south was not able to show a good/bad hand. he has 3 kings and one ace, but could have had some queens and jacks|pg||
nt|tomi2: and since he opened 1nt on AKAK last hand he cant have more than this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|trotto:  2@d = ask , 2nt 6 clubs , 3 @d relay ,  3@s= 3226 = , 4 @d - end signal( call P for bid 4 @h) 4 @s  = game @s sign off|pg||
nt|trotto:  tuszynski after  3 @s  bid knew about risky  to play  3 N    doubletons @h mirror|pg||
nt|nagini: i would prefer yo play longest suits... but whathever yuo wish sir:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: so this sequence must show mild slam interest from partner and south could go on imo|pg||
nt|nagini: would prefer 3 nt |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|frankaus: A & K get better evaluated - Q,s down graded|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|nagini: 6 sp 1430|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tez: now need to play @s ..from hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: An ace is definitely worth more than 4, and the jack is not worth 1|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  friendly lead, but declarer has a lot of work anyway|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|nagini: 6 cl 1370 only:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: my opps often cash two aces when i play 6@S without them, and woth no fit and no @SQ|pg||
nt|nagini: Apek does know his work:)|pg||
nt|nagini: tuszek wake up:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  when defence would have started with A @h and @h, declarer would be in trouble|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tomi2: teams, who finished higher in the RR have some carry over, and most important, the top teams may affort to lose one match in beteween|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in Italy use 2Nt = 3 cards limit+ and 3@H =4 cards limit+|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|nt|tomi2: he has a huge hand for this bidding. His partner was not counting on THIS when he balanced vulnerable|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tomi2: while the 5-8 teams will have to win one more match befor the semi-finals|pg||

nt|frankaus: a lot of points in this deck|pg||
nt|nagini: i'm trembling when Tuszek is playing always:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a expert told me that 2Nt in the previous hand int's GF - i suppose it is NoGF, because need to have a bid to invite|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|nagini: see?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: easy:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nigel_k:  Need to find a tenth trick though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S must be careful in this contract|pg||
nt|nagini: then wht to win?:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A low heart from North works because you hold heart losers to one and can still ruff two diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But that is looking at all four hands of course|pg||
nt|tez: pls lead partners suit:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: close to open this , i wouldnt but I am a big non-fan of QJ doubleton|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he made up for it, but .....|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|frankaus: @DQ and @C KQ ill not be such gr8 assets|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Olech still has to guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as they lead low from a doubleton in Poland|pg||
nt|nagini: Apek will do ... technics:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: a kib points out, that we are playing only black suits here all the time. What happend to good old hearts and diamonds? :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nagini: think he is too:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so I'm with Klimacki |pg||
nt|Gerben42: p 1m 4@H sounds perfect :)|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 4@S cuebid|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|nigel_k:  Since West has short diamonds there is a serious risk of going down with trumps 2-2 if you don't play them immediately|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Warren :)|pg||

pc|s2|nt|tez: nice start for declarer|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|nagini: nice|pg||
nt|nagini: - 1 only:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: it is Dariusz Kowalski|pg||
nt|nagini: wow|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: When declarer follows with the queen, the jack is a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now seven with K in @h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nigel_k:  Good defence to continue trumps|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree with declarers line though it didn't work - this is usually the case only when I am declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like as S should have played a @s in trick2|pg||
nt|warrens:  trying for 7, but I don't think he'll make 6 |pg||
pc|c7|nt|tez: we will see endplay soon|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe with good intermediates I would open it anyway - depends on mood |pg||

pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|nagini: dead  man:)|pg||
nt|tez: no need endplay sry|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|warrens:  if declarer plays spades by trying to cash the Ace, he's down for sure, but I think he's down even if he plays towards dummy (assuming East ruffs)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|warrens:  if he plays a spade, East ruffs and plays another trump.  now declarer has 5@D, 2@S, 2@H and 1@C.  can't even ruff one spade since East can ruff again|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h8|pc|dJ|nt|bridge_one: no way in all lines to make 12 tricks|pg||

mb|3N|nt|tez: this 2 nt showing 19/20 i thk|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D a great bid !|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 2@D might be a transfer to hearts, showing some at least mild invitational hand. playing this method 2@H becomes "GF in @D". quite popular in the Netherlands|pg||
mb|4H|nt|nagini: better idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/liga/liga2010-11/pierwsza/LIrunda9.html|pg||
nt|nagini: = just made|pg||
nt|trotto: because kibs are still asking for Kowaski-Tuszynski's system, I'll explain: after several relays when the distribution is known, 3nt is to play, 4@d is artificial, forcing to ...|pg||
nt|trotto: mandatory 4@h (and then pass on any bid of P) , while 4@c/4@h/4@s / 4nt are preferential blackwoods|pg||
nt|tez: other table bid 3 nt..brave @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: passing a easy 3Nt (lead @H...)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Next set at 12.00 local time, in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|frankaus: what sort of polish name is that  - it even has a vowel or 2|pg||
nt|trotto: bd   10|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like E/W will scramble to 4@S or 5@C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tomi2: it seems to be usefull as long as you dont forget about this too often, because then its quite expensive :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: good choice 4@D|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  He will try to get a club away on the hearts probably|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  In case West has the @cA|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now remove the @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: Lutostanski could not read the opening lead, it could have benn from 532 but in the 2nd trick the situation was clear|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: yes - this is typical playing with 4/3 |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2: I think EW underbid this hand but they get imps here because 3nt was not making|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cT|nt|trotto:  4 @d as  let's says "  signal of End"  . better knowed at polish " wywolanie koncowe"|pg||
nt|nagini: so have some food:):) ty:)|pg||
nt|trotto: e.g. if the opener has distrubution like 3-3-1-6 and the last answer to relay was 3@h, then 3@s = rkcb on @c fixed (because @c are the longest) 3nt to play, 4@c - rkcb on @s fixed ...|pg||
nt|trotto: (because if 2 suits are equal priority goes to major suit), 4@d - as explained above, 4@h rkcb @h, 4@s rkcb @d |pg||

pc|h3|nt|tomi2: his plan was to attack declarer in trumps with that weak ones in dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|warrens:  but I think declarer will get endplayed in dummy at the end and be forced to give a trump promotion.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally 2 trick in the trump, and after all the goood cards - when opps ruff remain with one trump - now you play last trump and make the rest of tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh well, dead now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
