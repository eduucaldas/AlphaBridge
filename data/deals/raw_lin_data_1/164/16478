mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Opening 11 balanced often leads to trouble|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: but has become amazingly common - looking at last week's Camrose, passing with 11 was more the exception|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|steveray: good lead but the cards lie well for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pjs_ch: there are always 5 tricks for the defence here, but it take work for declarer to get 8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: The format is Matchpointed Pairs (MP) so every trick counts|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|pjs_ch: ducking would make a difference if the suit is 6-2 but otehrwise it just lets the defence uncover the layout|pg||
nt|jbgood: E having a doubleton di honor is a great help|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pjs_ch: ducking here means declarer needs @HK entry, and declarer doesn't know for sure where the @HA is|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|Walddk2: End of round 13, short break|pg||
nt|jbgood: going for 7 wont give much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGRs Bridge Club is located in central London, near Marble Arch. TGR stands for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain Player, Irving Rose|pg||
nt|steveray: east only had 11 points|pg||
nt|steveray: so declarer should get this one right|pg||
nt|jbgood: lots of match points thrown away by not taking the finesse|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: those who lead 9 from T943 would have made it easy for declarer|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|d|nt|pjs_ch: balanced hand opening 1@C here, outside NT range and 1@H transfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: so 2@S just shows minimum 4cd support|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 @s undoubled is good for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: N's double tells S that they hold about half the pack|pg||
nt|steveray: the defence need a heart ruff to get 150|pg||
nt|jbgood: and a 9 card fit - law obeying people|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: East must find it hard to pass this out, since he will have expected to make 3@C|pg||
nt|jillan:  as I said earier- @@one down is good bridge@@ especially when opps make at least 4@C|pg||
nt|steveray: which they might have scored in clubs|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|steveray: easier to defend with north as declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough to double, but at MP you should double much more often than at IMPs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think so|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|mc|8|nt|pjs_ch: a partner who bids 2N can't have 4 hearts, so a ruff was indicated|pg||

mb|d|nt|Walddk2: And hearts will win it because N-S are vulnerable|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: K7532 is massive support for partner's overcall, but Cope was probably biddign 4@H anyway|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: On the surface you can make 12 tricks, but that is an illusion because clubs break badly|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: always 10 tricks here (4 trumps, 2 ruffs and 4 outside) but instinct might be to try to set up clubs first|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: I think Simon will take 11|pg||

nt|jillan:  wow, who are they|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW £200|pg||
nt|jillan:  so on paper an easy win for NS... LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS from Norway, EW from Morocco|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness?|pg||
nt|jillan:  Geir Helgemo?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, 3,300 for Helgemo, the most expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: yes, Helness&Charlsen|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: well respected, but half way down the list in the first session|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2011/london/tgrs2ndauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub2ndauctionpairs-session2.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGRs Auction Pairs is Europe's Cavendish kind of, but there is a huge gap moneywise|pg||

nt|pitiful:  well done by declarer|pg||

nt|pitiful:  the south bidding looks ugly to me with 3433 shape|pg||
nt|steveray: and how many bids will it take|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: interesting questions often about respond to FSF with 3 cds but not stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is the only making game|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: they may bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: wow !|pg||
nt|jbgood: have ...:)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: his partner has bid all the other suits, so North doesn't expect himto have many spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The thing is, Patrick, that gthey do not bypass a major at the 1-level|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: if the defence start with three rounds of spades, declarer has to put all his faith in a 3-3 heart break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 3433 as here is possible, and so is 1435|pg||
nt|steveray: did't expect S to rebid 1@h without gen clubs|pg||
nt|jbgood: they just bid up the linbe|pg||
nt|jbgood: line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but if Charlsen had bid 1NT, as many would do, would West have found a spade lead? I doubt it|pg||
nt|steveray: so I see, sems to work, but doesn't define any strength|pg||
nt|steveray: seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you should overcall 1@S at MP. Any views?|pg||
nt|jbgood: you expect it to be a 12-14 hand to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: Thomas is thinking|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: absolutely, boss suit should always get in|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would but then that is no surprise to you i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter bids on tram tickets|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: will this sequence by helness show a hand too good to raise directly from 1@H to 4@H ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: ... and thinking...|pg||
nt|steveray: seems a perfectly respectable 1@s to me, if you don't then you haven't gottem|pg||
nt|vugraphzyk: ... and... passsss|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|pjs_ch: he has choices in the play - he might decide not to play to make if it's more likely to go two off that way|pg||
nt|steveray: could also have x'd 4th suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are getting a £3,000 pair next round|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
