nt|athene: you add the number of cards in the suit to the number of hcp in the suit, and take it away from pi squared, and take that away from the level|pg||
nt|athene: or something exotic|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  add ;level of contract to number of your trumps; you need 6 to leave in|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: ah right ok|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  also add level of contract to number of your trump tricks; you need 4 to leave in|pg||
mb|5C|nt|roswolf: this could have been ineresting on a diamond lead against 4@H|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  hoping that NI have no double cards!|pg||
nt|athene: yes, east wins the @HK, lays down the @CA, west plays the queen so east can underlead for the ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  why do we have no flags for the NS players?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: 5@C looks a bit rich at love all|pg||

pc|h3|nt|athene: when i say "a bit rich" i mean "totally bonkers" of course|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: I consider the 5@C bid totally incredile - the kamikaze complex|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  The Alexes never like to underbid...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  4@c would be eniugh for me - and even that would feel aggressive|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose every so often you persuade opps to bid 5@H one down - that's the holy grail you are going for|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  just need to crash the @sA-K to get out for one down|pg||

mb|2C|nt|mikeirl: Hi Jystin|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|4C|nt|milton_se: fit jump, it seems|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|justin c: 4@h is where you want to be|pg||
nt|justin c: but not so easy to figure that out|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C = 11+ nat|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: err  is that right?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|milton_se: trumps 3-2, no drama|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 5@C cheaper than 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not if NS can find their @s ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but this can go down|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Sorry 2@C = clubs INV+ or other GF, 2@D relay|pg||
nt|justin c: i should have more faith|pg||
nt|mikeirl: S attack best|pg||
nt|justin c: imagined that N would try harder to play in @C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|justin c: knows he is being forced if @H trumps, but the short hand taking the tap in @C|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: Seems as a flatty. 120 tr|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10 tr|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the necessity of making one more trick for game may have influenced his thinking|pg||
nt|rmb1: Trumps 3-3 makes this easy in practice but not before some agonising|pg||

nt|athene: @SK lead and it would have been 500|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  juniors about 15 years ago|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: they can even get the 500 after the heart lead but it would involve north switching to a small spade|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|roswolf: south leaps forward into the mists of the valley of obscurity|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well 3@H would not have been my prediction of the final contract|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: south has a difficult decision on lead|pg||
nt|athene: @CK in dummy or singleton somewhere is perhaps the best hope |pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room 4@H looks optimistic even for an irishman|pg||
nt|athene: north probably won't have it (no redouble)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East-West are playing a 14-16 1NT, so East was too weak for 1NT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|athene: both wests pretty much just ignored the possibility that their partner might hold only three hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose technically you should try to cater for that|pg||
nt|athene: but in practice people don't|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Mike Tedd should have doubled 4@h in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
nt|roswolf: standing on his chair i would think|pg||

pc|h3|pc|c3|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: bad news|pg||
nt|athene: if you have long, weak trumps, but are balanced everywhere else, things can go poorly in defence sometimes because declarer can get a crossruff going|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|nt|athene: and you just have to sit impotently by and then end up underruffing an embarrassing number of times|pg||
nt|roswolf: or rather good news on this defence|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: so maybe north was worried about that|pg||
nt|athene: but as you say i think double was the boring, obvious, and successful action|pg||
nt|roswolf: at the 4 level -----hmmmmmmmm|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  taking the spafe ruff before the second diamond would have been better|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|h2|pc|sK|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i guess it's quick run through|pg||
nt|mikeirl: assume there was more to the bidding than recorded :)|pg||
nt|steveray: saves time opening with the best contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: both pairs play strong NT and 5 card majors|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thats one way of retaining trump control :)|pg||
nt|justin c: temporarily, anyway|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|rodal f: S for a opening? Y|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rmb1: Have to avoid losing two spades in 4@H but defence may establish @CQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry just catching up|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ok|pg||
nt|steveray: hard to see this making|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  3NT is harder|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Feel NS are in trouble|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes. D lead shoul beat |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the end of 3NT then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would like the see the bidding, i cant understand why they arent in 4@H|pg||
nt|steveray: assuming East opened 1@C South should not take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c "natural", ostensibly 5+ clubs and a major or 6+ clubs with enough to open the bidding|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh boy ...................|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: but being in third position at favourable is enough to open the bidding nowadays|pg||
nt|mrt2000: trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@C = nat, limited (6+ or 5C+4M)|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: won't be happy |pg||
nt|pfbr: :(|pg||
nt|mrt2000: happier than if doubled!!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrt2000: N must have seen his partner's overcalls before|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: E? Who have the rest of the pints?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Could have been a interestin 6@D if opp was 1-3 at @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for North to act with all but one of his points in opponents suits|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for South - best is probably not to shift to spades, but it looks an obvious defence to follow|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Second best|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||

nt|milton_se: East may still think it's making :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c6|nt|dburn: well, he followed it - but declarer didn't have any diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: and this has helped him keep control of the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: to the extent that if he can guess hearts, he will actually make|pg||
nt|rmb1: or discard a heart and ensure -1|pg||

nt|athene: but no-one is bidding it|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|roswolf: yes but i fancy they will end up in the boring 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if E-W bid diamonds and north showed club support then south might get excited perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: the inverted raise might tempt them down another path|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even the Alexes use their pass cards at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south will be mildly excited now|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: of course if he shows diamond shortage, north will bid a firm 3nt and then put all the bidding boxes away|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: so preventing any higher adventures|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  is that what 2@d shows - most play suits as stopper showing?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: but if south can diagnose the @D void is not worjong for slam purposes he will wimp out |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: working|pg||
nt|roswolf: south having a long think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: but as expected passes|pg||
nt|vugraphzxv: Hogg fingering @DA|pg||
nt|athene: i would imagine 2@D is some sort of ask|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt they would use such a low-level bid to show specifically diamond shortage|pg||

nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hJ on side  in 6@c|pg||
nt|milton_se: there|pg||
pc|s5|nt|justin c: can subsequently promote @S10|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3@D showed a @H suit here|pg||

nt|mrt2000: 10 or 11 tricks here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: Hi Meddy:)|pg||
nt|steveray: North needs partner to play a club before the D@s are set up|pg||
nt|steveray: Diamonds that is|pg||
nt|dburn: one of these days, the English will lead trumps when declarer actually has some diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||

pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: but will south lead @C?|pg||
nt|steveray: might the @D be a singleton?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: odds on to|pg||
nt|rmb1: North can afford to be passive, but this is the most direct approach.  Hopefully 4@C bid will reap its rewards now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might take his partner for a singleton @D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer would not allow @DK to win if he had the ace|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hopefully selway will work that out|pg||
nt|justin c: is the West hand not worth a strong @C opening?|pg||
nt|justin c: seen worse|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe they dont get to game even then|pg||
pc|s8|nt|insia1: good bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make S hand as main and nwxt|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north just relies on partner super-accepting the transfer on most of the hands where 4@S is really good|pg||
nt|roswolf: an unsuprisinf auction|pg||
nt|greerm: good decision as the cards lie|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: so you play either 4@S or 2@S, rather than silly 3-level nonsense|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: if that hand is outside your notrump range you usually open 1@H, don't you? playing 4-card majors?|pg||

mb|3S|mb|d|nt|athene: i just suggested privately i would open 1nt with east - not the sort of thing i was going to admit in public of course|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east feels obliged to bid as his namesake would :)|pg||
nt|greerm: suggested it privately to Mr Hogg did you ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the EW card says they can open 1NT with a singleton king|pg||
nt|roswolf: another surreal auction|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H 5minor can be awkward if you aren't strong enough to reverse - 1nt fits the bill nicely and gives east the best chance of making his black kings too|pg||

mb|4N|nt|roswolf: as must west|pg||

nt|athene: so the double just costs 1 imp i think?|pg||

nt|athene: yes but it's 600 not 620?|pg||
nt|greerm: ah yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: 750 you mean|pg||

nt|greerm: 600 + 140|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it was still -sub-optimal the double i mean|pg||
nt|greerm: now 13 I think|pg||
nt|athene: leading a singleton when you have a singleton trump has a much lower chance of working out|pg||
nt|athene: because you basically need partner to have the ace in your led suit, to get a ruff|pg||

nt|milton_se: of course - 40 is enough|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not vul?|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|rodal f: Some partscores here. The best is at EW by 6-2 in @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@D@C is -1 but if Xed|pg||
mb|d|nt|rmb1: On  26 England bid higher and made fewer 3@S-1 7IMP back to Ireland|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: interesting|pg||
nt|milton_se: plain math|pg||
nt|mrt2000: what will E do here?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@H normaly a garb bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and 27 is very good for Ireland also|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT = 6-12 (semi-forcing).  2@C rebid would be INV+ with spades or GF.  Difficult to get to @S part score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they did well keeping low, easy to get excited with 6/5 distribution|pg||
nt|steveray: yes, have to open one, then pass the raise - unlikely, better off where they are|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does Garvey know he won the trick?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: your lead partner!|pg||
nt|steveray: guess he'd rather not have, Selway didn't want to win, as he didn't know what to do next either:)|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|greerm: same multi in the CR|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt from south perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: just sort of taking a chance on the hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: also our appreciation to the on-site organisers and BGB for bringing this fine event to our screens|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but it won't work out well if he does|pg||
nt|athene: (3nt, @HK lead)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|greerm: a little hope for us here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: not a lot it seems|pg||
nt|greerm: S has points but not tricks|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: south might now be wondering if 3@H is a cue|pg||
mb|d|nt|greerm: 3@H looks for stopper|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: possible to construct layouts where east has spades and south actually has a monster with hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: this is one of the problems dealing with multi - you don't have any clear cue-bid as opps have no anchor suit|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h2|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|athene: you could play another trump there, going for 3-3 break - but if they aren't, opps draw trumps and run the hearts...no fun|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|h6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|greerm: correct technique is to let opps have their trumps separately|pg||
nt|greerm: even if they split|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: he doesn't really have a problem here as he can afford to let opps make their trumps separately even if 3-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|athene: it's a nastier decision if you have to pick between "safe 1 down" or "maybe make, maybe 3 down"|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|justin c: @S and another|pg||
nt|dburn: time for leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S = S + m|pg||
mb|d!|nt|justin c: 6@S off on @H lead |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|rmb1: On  8 (Ghestem) England bid to 4@S= so 4@Hx-2 was a good sacrifice|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|milton_se: prev board may be costly: 3NT making and at least 500 in 2HX|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|rodal f: Can't fight 2NT= It's the max EW and a normal contract|pg||
mb|p!|nt|rodal f: Or?|pg||
nt|dburn: that might not get a heart lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: might be coming back here though|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: or then again...|pg||
nt|rmb1: wd|pg||
nt|dburn: Whittaker perhaps thought that Carroll was taking an advance save|pg||
nt|dburn: so his double was just penalty, not Lightner|pg||
nt|justin c: if one of East's @h were a @C would have 12 here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: very low scores in all the matches, does that mean flat hands or brilliant bridge?|pg||

nt|athene: ...and the 2@S sort of confirms that :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|athene: there is slightly less urgency about bidding here at these colours - even if you miss a game, you should be getting quite a few hundreds in return|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if you are vul against not it's a lot more worrying|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: clearly 2@S showed a 2 suiter but this contract i dont fancy|pg||
nt|athene: ok, this auction suggests that 2@S showed 4 spades and longer minor - or why would west leave it in diamonds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxv: 2@S explained as possibly 4 with a longer minor|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: burns fears very short spades in dummy so attacks the ruffs right away - then finds there is no need|pg||

nt|roswolf: me|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|athene: declarer might have been considering running the club - not because a discard on the @CA would help him very much (even if he could get there) but just because it would stop the ...|pg||
nt|athene: defence being able to force him in clubs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: when trump control is an issue you often want to leave as many side-suit winners around as possible so the defence can't force you|pg||

nt|athene: two down suggests declarer just took three trumps, three spades, club - so north hung on to that @SJxxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: yes, -100 isn't so bad for such an ugly spot :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be another test for e/w|pg||
nt|athene: will west open 1@S if not playing some 2-suited gadget?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: i would|pg||
nt|roswolf: and so does west|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H looks a bit heavy to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: it might not be easy for e/w to find their fit now|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite pre-emptive so might very well get passed out when south has some random 7-8 count or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: overcalling very heavy overcalls actually works better when they are lower (like 1@D over 1@C) because it's just so much less likely they will get passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk6: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: agreed i suppose you want to be in 4@H|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: but it is only a nv game and may not make some of the time|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: if north had doubled, south would have had a nasty problem - 2@C i suppose|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  the heavy 2@h overcall has scored a goal|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|athene: then north bids 2@H over that and south has a raise i guess|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe only the end result will tell|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  close between 2@c and 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: well it all depends whether the spade ruff is found against 4@H in the other room i suppose :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  has anyone worked out whether 1@s doubled makes?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  even without the spade ruff, there could be two club losers|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: no i leave that to more erudite persons ie GIB|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|s5|nt|athene: i hadn't considered that - i didn't think there was any way the auction could end in 1@SX :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: nor do i south would have bid over the double i amm sure|pg||
mc|9|nt|yorkbeach:  Klinger's rule says South should not pass 1@s doubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: still by overcalling north stoopped any such fantasy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South would need 5 spades, which he has but also 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|athene: is that some complicated rule about leaving t/o doubles in?|pg||
