nt|me argent: wold is conflicted|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: but since scoring is BAM EW must bid again  each board is just win/lose/draw|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if you want team rosters [and carryover at start of day]  check out bottom of http://www.acbl.org/nabc/results/2010/03/4/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: teams have decimal totals because of carryover calculated from Day 1 and Day 2  [field cut each day]|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Some specs were suggesting 1)That S might have opened 2N  or 2) over 3@s, South might haved Xed|pg||

nt|daman: Stansby has a shot at Player of the Year depending how he does in this event vis-a-vis Brad Moss in the North American Swiss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the board you see is the board being played as bd 4 in all the other matches;  i don't know what happened to require a substitute bd here|pg||
nt|daman: the specs tell me Stansby needs to be 8th or higher to win the PoY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 10 teams in the final|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 39 teams entered the event;  after one day reduced to 20; after yesterday reduced to 10 for the finals|pg||
nt|me argent: tough event |pg||
nt|ahollan1: National Swiss reduction even more drastic|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Probably the toughest, because of the deep cuts.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- site just showing top 10  but 36 teams in the final of the Swiss|pg||
nt|daman: well    I think we are up todate on the PoY  with the help of the specs    Stansby   Sontag   and Brogeland are the only 3 in the running     when Moss DNQ in the Reisenger he was ...|pg||
nt|daman: eliminated     I thought he could drop down to the NA Swiss    not so|pg||
nt|me argent: most of teams cut are 1st class|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Brad Moss, that is.   Mike is playing in the Reisinger today|pg||
nt|daman: vraiment|pg||
nt|USBF:  Reisinger standings after 10 rounds:  1.Cayne 19.72; 2.Smirnov 159.34; 3.Bathurst 17.77;  4.Rosenthal 17.28; 5.Jacobus 16.25;6.Gordon 16.19;    7.Fleisher 15.00; 8.Moss 14.34; 9.Strul 14.1110. Jacobs 13.65;|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does ACBL have ANY events where you can lose in one national event then drop into a different ongoing event?   i think that is unique to some of the WBF World Championships|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: i bet Stansby would NOT open 4@D in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: a couple of minutes until rd 3|pg||
nt|daman: I always thought that you would not have an outside Ace when you tried Namyats|pg||
nt|me argent: conventions are there to be used and more importantly be abused|pg||
nt|daman: if partner had a red Ace and the @C King     it would be most unfortunate|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I think that w/Namyats, players can play it either way, the same sort of thing as in Michaels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each partnership defines which holdings are valid for Namyats|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Michaels used to be reserved for either very weak or very strong hands, but now players use it for all distributiuoonal hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think George Rosenkranz write-up was probably the most restrictive|pg||
nt|me argent: i put namyats rgt up there with playing transfers when using the weak nt|pg||
nt|me argent: well maybe not as high|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Another win there for Rosenthal.|pg||

nt|me argent: hostage to slowest table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein went for 800 twice -- or was it 3 times |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the real problem is that players mill about and don't come to their table right away.  now 3 mins are already gone from the clock this round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told players DO get to compare with teammates between rounds -- what does panel think of this "barometer" type situation?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|kit: nice double -- well, successful|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: norths action maybe says that souths TOX was maybe a little agressive?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: what?????|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: oyyy|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: What is that?|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|me argent: maybe not against these guys|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Srry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein in 3@H south|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: We all make bids that are not "perfect"|pg||
nt|cedrict: bien de laisser passe le @C|pg||
nt|cedrict: probably 9 tricks = 130|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: I can't remotely imagind bidding 4@S with Kx of hearts and only 3 spades|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But I think, as a spec just pointed out, this is a case of nerves here.|pg||
nt|dima:  Another violation of Burn's Law - one should try to have more trumps then opponents|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Val -- the election is over   we have a few months where you can be totally honest|pg||
nt|me argent: thats not what east did considered he had no def so why not?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: lol|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: OK, then hopeless Al (adjective of choice)|pg||
nt|kit: However, after that lead may get out for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: much better|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, then, w./their teammates in 3@h......|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: -100 vs +140|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Easy win|pg||
nt|kit: but it doesn't look like 3@H is going to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no signs of nerves here behaviorally -- they are all quite seasoned, despite some of their relatively young ages|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: True|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Just looked again|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: they seem to have 5 losers|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, yes it will|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cedrict: i would have passed 1NT anyway|pg||
nt|dima:  I agree - may we descend from the same group of chickens :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i think EW were 3rd in the Open BAM earlier this tourney|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: they've also represented Germany in 2010 European Championships and 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||

nt|hedyg: don't. Open one browser window per table|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: 4@s with few points but good shaüe|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: shape even :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: shall we crossruff?|pg||
nt|doctorone: S may have tried 4@d , fit showing, in case oppos overbid to 5@h for instance|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: his @ds are not all that great|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dima:  The absence of @c lead might lead N to think that W has @d king|pg||
pc|dT|nt|stc: crossruff or playing on @d, both work|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might go as far as 5@s|pg||
pc|h6|nt|doctorone: true, but it is that same "shape" you mentioned with Constantin|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|s2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: personally i like the fitjump to show an exploitable suit|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|doctorone: notice that we start with boards 31 and 32 here first, so that we get comparisons whenwe are back to board 17|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dima:  Well passed hand can hardly have it ALL - suit with source of trick, safety for 4@s and good trumps, so I do think that 4@d is a good bid if available|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|hedyg: he could have better @ds and long but not as nice @ss|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have opened the S hand 2@s, @s and a minor, less than opening values|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c5|nt|doctorone: if available, of course Hedy :)|pg||
nt|stc: What about a @h save ?|pg||
nt|dima:  Probably was not available to South (they play weak 2 I believe)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|sA|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|sT|pg||
mc|11|nt|dima:  5@h runs into control problem on 4-0 break, but they might have bid to 5@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|kit: So the awful 4@S bid didn't cost at all.  Strange game, BAM|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner opened North hand 2@D    Nystrom in 4@S East|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I think Piekarek and Smirnov have played every session in this event; certainly every session in the past two days|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dima:  Sorry they play variable NT so red 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|dima:  8 top tricks after the lead and not much of potential for more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: anybody know what the double shows?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D was weak showing          @D|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h5|nt|cedrict: i am watching the ski as well as this match :)|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: would this be a bizarre push|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Well, it wld appear that Smirnov will win this board|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will attack hearts, and make many tricks it looks like|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: very nice @H layout for declarer|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfd: made 3 on last hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seem Smirnov took pretty deep position passing 1N|pg||

mb|p|nt|stc: undo ?!|pg||
nt|doctorone: 2@h??? That can't be right... Caroline ? |pg||
nt|stc: 2@h by N|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|dima:  In fact 6@s is playable on dummy reversal line if we gather the inference about Â¨C Ace (not conclusive though)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|doctorone: do we know if is 2@h systemic here or a simple weak 2? If it is the later I am not an opener|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|dima:  Strange that South did not use it on previous board then|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|doctorone: agree Heady... Think it is an "out of system" action by N|pg||
nt|stc: I don't think so, I played this with tarik|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, they should agree on what they play then|pg||
nt|stc: oposed a weak 2 S would have explored a @s contract|pg||

nt|USBF:  We think tht Cayne scored 1/2 on the last round|pg||

nt|cedrict: one more hand and 40 minutes break|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Looks like an easy game for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  loosing one nonspade each|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: ok, so then....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's close :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Yes, that's why I asked|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 1n either nautral or any hadn with 0-6/7|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kit: not clear what double of 1NT shows here|pg||
nt|dima:  3@s is a bit timid if it is systemically NF|pg||
nt|cedrict: et voilà, égalité, 23 imps d'avance pour 4 @C|pg||
nt|dima:  N14 has not been scored yet and this one looks good for La Chaux at this table|pg||
nt|cedrict: good @S lead anyway|pg||
nt|dima:  Well the absence of @d lead might tip that East has one top diamond|pg||
nt|cedrict: correct.. possible 6-7 imps on 14 for la Chaux|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Guess it is penalties |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: when asked about the X, Bramley shrugs|pg||
nt|cedrict: different game... but probably same result|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Rosenberg in 2@S North     Willenken bid 1N over the DBL instead of Demirev's pass|pg||
nt|kit: interesting trick 1 problem here|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Has to play J|pg||
nt|USBF:  Reisinger standings after 13 rounds:  1.Smirnov 26.34;  2.Cayne 26.22;3.Gordon 24.69; 4.Rosenthal 23.28;5.Bathurst 23.27; 6.Jacobus 22.25;7. Moss 21.84;8.Fleisher 21.00; 9.Strul 18.1110. Jacobs 16.65; |pg||

nt|vugraphzyb: Brilliant lead|pg||
nt|cedrict: :) ja|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: A club lead would have caused some problems for East|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|vdoubleu: But alternatively...not playing J...|pg||
nt|kit: and probably wouldn't help anyway|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
