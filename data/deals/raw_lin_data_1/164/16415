mb|1D|mb|p|nt|tomi2: its just ana agreement I have with some partners. with nat nonforcing I simply lead a club vs 1nt and with a good hand I double and lead a club|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphp2: sorry for problems, Kalita played 7 of spade the result is -3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, lead a card and claim|pg||

nt|nagini: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sfoxa:  danger!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, not, if 3nt was alerted|pg||
nt|tomi2: Tuszynski - Kowalski have been playing together for many years, I bet they know their follow-ups to multi|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree with pass by West - the DBL means only points, for sure not long @h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C would be forced|pg||
nt|nagini: he will manage:)|pg||
nt|vbman: so 1 nt is weak?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Nige Kearney|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nigel|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this contract is much safer|pg||
nt|vbman: or 15-17?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14 balanced hands are opened 1@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like this 3@S bid with this flat hand and a known 8 card fit only|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  N knows partner has maximum hand with @h|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tomi2: west will need to decide what ace partner has|pg||
nt|vbman: and the rebid after 1 red suit is?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: passed hoping in 2 @s tricks - difficult to think North void in @S !|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 12-14 they start a "rescue" sequence and try to find a ceah major fit before 1NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nagini: only nuclear weapon against this transfers:)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you bid a major over 1@D (0-7) if you have 12-14. Can be 3 cards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nagini: on this level they rarely bid without a reason|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is not natural. it may include "any 0-6 hand"|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  next time it does no harm, but now E has the lead as described in a bridge book|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||

pc|c3|nt|nagini: mostly playing against them askin for drink:)|pg||

pc|s3|nt|nigel_k:  This one looks like it was lucky to escape undoubled|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bridge_one: with seven @C the pass at 3@H is dangerous - in this sequence 4@C can be a strong hand, but only long suit - and with K@S sgl can pass at 4@S ...|pg||

nt|tomi2: E/W are members of the Polish seniors team, having won lots of medals in the last years|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And N-S play for Lithuania|pg||
nt|tomi2: Lasocki used to be a top player in the 80's and 90's playing with Gawrys|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: at all level it is possible dont guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: ah yesss|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tomi2: North is a sponsor from Lithuania who plays in Poland very often|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S!|nt|tomi2: 3@D is probably invitational. North has support a single but minimum and no aces. this time 3@D is the best spot for them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably they use DBL for @h and 1@h for @S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vbman: so there is no mistake in saying that poland is one of the top nations of bridge|pg||

mb|4C|nt|Gerben42: well done finding the 5-3 fit in the 4th suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: here you see the reason why support doubles were invented originally. I read somewhere that Rodwell was also fan of bidding 3 card suits if there is no other good bid available and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: he did not like to play in 3-3 fits when partner raised him with 3 cards in competive situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|juror1: welcome Tezcan Sen of Turkey|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Opposite a weak NT game is unlikely and Qxx in opponents suit is bad|pg||
nt|vbman: can bridge teaching supply a living in europe?|pg||
nt|tomi2: remember, this is the Polish Premiere LEague, so it starts with a round robin event, but they will play KO matches afterwards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poland keep recruiting new players through hard work by a lot of people. The Polish junior players are extremely good, and they have lots of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: yes, especialy in Germany, we have lots of wealthy old people playing Bridge in their local clubs, who want to be better then their friends|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's our point of view|pg||

nt|Gerben42: friendly @c break sees this home|pg||
nt|othered1: with everything very friendly from this point, GIB (who peeks) would likely make an overtrick.  Here, though, declarer is looking for the safest line for 4. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now easy to make 10 tricks, because A in @C must be in West, so small @C from dummy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vbman: l also very much appreciate the german national team|pg||
nt|tomi2: the main aim from all teams is to finish top 8 here in this round robin|pg||

nt|vbman: any co?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nigel_k:  At the other table South tried for game and 3@h failed by a trick|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|vbman: carry over?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tomi2: the guys were always happy to play events in Turkey, like Istanbul 2004 or other open events!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tomi2: there will be carry over but not significant, most important is, that the top 4 teams need to win 1 match only to get to semifinals|pg||
nt|tomi2: and if they lose they get a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|vbman: and u bet they do very well, burrying opponents|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5-8 teams first need to win among this group and then against one of the 1-4 losers|pg||
nt|vbman: seems fair enough|pg||
nt|tomi2: but any of the first 8 teams may become Polish champion while the teams ranked 9-16 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: with the 9-12 teams having similar advantage while the 13-16 teams will have to work hard, if they don't want to play in 2nd devision next year|pg||

nt|tomi2: the "Katok" team basicly consists of players from Belarus and Lithuania, but they were welcome to join the polish league system and made their way throught the lower leagues and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: are constant members of 1st devision|pg||
nt|vbman: they have polish nationality?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tomi2: east tried not to joker around in teams, thats good. a small heart would have cut declarer from the club tricks, but he took the safer way for -1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tomi2: its always difficult for "outsiders" to identify the teams, because neraly all of them have companies as sponsor, so their teams are called so|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: no, but they are member of polish bridge federation|pg||

nt|vbman: he wont bid any less than 4h|pg||
nt|tomi2: but we won't see them live this weekend since the matches are played in 2 diffrent cities, and we have the North-East teams here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tomi2: teams from south and west, lke Wroclaw, play among themselfes in another city|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nagini: winner are always winners|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: riski 3 cl|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but right time for it|pg||
nt|tomi2: what I find interesting is that both NS pairs, using the same methods, chose different bids on every of the first 4 hands|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 1 N tried to support partner with 3@S, in board 2 south started with a double and ot 1NT|pg||
nt|nagini: hard to stop before 6|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tomi2: most of the teams we see this weekend are from Warsaw|pg||
nt|vbman: so how long does it last and how many times is it held in a year?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 5@c is not so bad|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bridge_one: true Dany :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you start with 2 weekends rond robin, this is the 2nd one, and then several KO matches. The finals will be held in may|pg||
nt|vbman: no 3h will be the limit|pg||
nt|tomi2: the winner will represent Poland in the next European Champions Cup|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|tomi2: in 3 N went directly to the major game not trying for 3NT and in 2 they tried to invite balanced instead of going towards a @D contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: odzywka praktyczna|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well bid|pg||
nt|tez: double dummy play..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for bridge players it is important to have good gadgets after 1ANY pass pass|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: 2@H after dbl 17+|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  3NT needs partner to have something in hearts, but making 11 tricks in diamonds needs a lot more|pg||
nt|nagini: want to play hearts? not a good idea:)|pg||
nt|vbman: oh my|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S by Vainikonis tends to promise 5 spades in Poland|pg||
nt|tomi2: they like to make "heavy" 1@S bids on 4 spades and some points|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: wow thats some double swing|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C hit the jackpot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2@c dbl was not penalty for sure|pg||
nt|vbman: so north hand is close to 1sp or a q|pg||
nt|tomi2: east should pass as long as he is not doubled and later think of correcting to 5@D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tez: i would bid 3@c with west hand..you?|pg||
nt|tomi2: while this 2@S bid may be standard in USA or France, this is a 1@S bid in Polish methods|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello everyone!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duking the D risk Q@D @d ruff losing after the K@D|pg||
nt|vbman: taking the low road resulted well|pg||
nt|vbman: if they played in nt it wd be a 15 point difference|pg||
nt|vbman: operator what are ns talking now?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|nagini: felt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: my asistant says ''we say "side suit first" :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most of the breaks will be because most Polish players smoke - so they need a short time in such 12 board matches|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|tomi2: even if he went down it would gain lots of imps since NS made 4@S over there|pg||
nt|pfbr: "assistant" :)|pg||
nt|nagini: personally I would choose  pepsi a pd|pg||
nt|vbman: smoking kills|pg||
nt|tomi2: this hand is easy in polish club, you open 1@C and start counting your points. For EW here 1@C is a limited opening, so Jagniewski had to guess or count his points first before ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: opening|pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: in vuln normal 3@h opening|pg||
nt|nagini: one condition only: as my sponsor:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: light openung|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tomi2: the best movement for the players was "4-board BAM swiss" so they had to wait for the other results and couls smore every 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: players was talking about previous board|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think with wests hand you should not force your partnership to the 5th level if you start the match leading in the 25 VP margin|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: pepsi has a feeling in fingers:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad controls isnt worth 12|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but I by today's standards, it's pretty sound -- a couple of 10's, and a couple of honor tricks make up for the acelessness.|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, if you can get them to take a phantom save, vul, it does have its merits.|pg||
nt|tomi2: you already need a good dummy to cause s relative flat score compared to passing 4@H with those two major aces|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Gerben42: good correction to 5@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if partner cannot open 2@S, probably the suit is insufficient|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@D of course is multi - long @h or @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: if 4@H was making you need to escape for -3 maximum to have a relatively flat board|pg||
nt|tomi2: while you need a huge dummy to turn a bad baord into a good one - but this will not bring you more VP tan you already have|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|tomi2: but it riscs going down more or going down while 4@H was not making - in those scenarios you lose imps. so IMO bidding can win very seldom but lose very often|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: the players don't know the running score but they know the score after 12 boards|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|othered1: Effective double by north.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be worried about @C now|pg||
nt|othered1: He can hold this to -1 with the right view on the minor suit positions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but might take a wrong view on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is to give the A in @D - cab be usefull for the lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0549.JPG North|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0550.JPG this is north|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: and they already had one board where they might expect to win imps and one where they might lose, wo it was not unlikely that the result was still 25-x at that point|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|nt|egezzer: Hi everyone |pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|pfbr: Morning, Roland@h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NS must take their 5 tricks now|pg||
nt|nagini: @h|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|tomi2: I guess this was a puppet stayman sequence, 3@C asked for majors, 3@D= at least one 4 card major, 3@H=spades 3@S=fit 3NT is forcing then showing interest in slam|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|vbman: so does anyone think the current score must be told to the players?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: not ruffing high is a pretty extreme position here|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@C,4@D cuebids 4NT RKCB 5C=0 5@D=@SQ?. 5@S probably =yes I have|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5nt now should ask for kings, but I am not 100% sure about their methods|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Gerben42: this will be tough to get right ruff high and double finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0541.JPG this is Vainikonis|pg||
nt|jkotor: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: at least they spend a lot of time in the BBO practise rooms, so they know their system :)|pg||
mb|6S|nt|tomi2: wil he play now for some miracle-squeeze?|pg||
nt|po-s: 6c most likely asking for CQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe 5@S already showed one king and with none he would bid 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|nt|Gerben42: sorry no finesse needed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: another big swing to Unia|pg||
nt|othered1: Compared to the auction in the othe room, the one here looks perfectly normal.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or was the ugly 1N opening very specialized?|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: a weak one I guess|pg||
nt|othered1: -2?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white on red|pg||
nt|egezzer: hi Jakub|pg||
nt|egezzer: Nice to see here that Konrad Araszkiewicz and Dariusz Kowalski. Impossible to watch for me them until in 12th World Championship Verone 2006(Open Pairs) and played very well ...|pg||
nt|egezzer: actually|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  would he like to have bit of rest now? :-)|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SKQJ and 5 hearts with west|pg||
nt|tomi2: with semi-friendly clubs and the marked @D finesse 6NT should make. @C10 is dropping, so the 9 will be a trick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|po-s: I think with side king + SQ he wouldm bid his king, but having shown DK already he only bid 5S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tomi2: 4@D could have been a singleton|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|po-s: I meant having cued diamonds already...|pg||
nt|tomi2: I don't know their agreements on 3NT, it could promise a flat hand, then 4@D would be the king for sure|pg||
nt|po-s: problem with trumps 4-1 as he has both a club and a heart loser|pg||
nt|po-s: but lucky this time|pg||
nt|tomi2: Jagniewski avoided problems in trumps by bidding 6Nt|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I think he forgot to cash @CA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|po-s: perhaps finesse is better nas there is a possible squeeze left|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tomi2: think it would be fair against those opps to claim simply and say "if there is this squeeze I make 13, else 12"|pg||

nt|tomi2: again some "Hamman" 3NT try, this time stopped by west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||

nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
nt|vbman: push board|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: am quite suprised that Russian did not bid 2@D after 1@S - that is a GF relay promising at least 3 card support in @S and enough for game|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
nt|tomi2: skipping the 2@D relay often indicates a) not such good 3 card support and/or b) a better heart suit|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  If you play hearts first and they don't break your entries are destroyed even if the diamonds were 3-3|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: No ideal bid for Kalita here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess one has double although that would indicate four spades|pg||
nt|tomi2: he could cash @S before to have 9 tricks for sure and finesse later or catch the singleton queen and play @S10 and then the other spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bridge_one: here 4@S ON also with A@C and @C lead because opener will play A@S and @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = 3 cards raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  that was the way, yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 3@H with 4cards raise|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|nigel_k:  Some pairs play that double shows spades and 1@s denies them|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No game makes for N-S but that's because South has no opener (in my view)|pg||
nt|nagini: sped for to be down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Otherwise hands like North have no good bid|pg||
nt|nagini: nmf|pg||
mb|4H|nt|frankaus: agree - only 25 zars - do u like zars  - i'm a fan|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No, I stick to the 4321 scale but I am no fan. It is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|tomi2: Let me try to introduce the format they are playing here. This is the Polish Premiere League. 16 Teams play a compleate round robin on thwo weekends, so they will finish sunday but ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: then the "fun" will start. The field will be torn into groups of 4 - basicly its most important to be top 8 after sunday|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: but we are sure he will lead @d ace or @s ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: normal lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a kinitz told me 2NT is GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 2@C would be nmf. I guess they play some GF checkback or so|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: then the teams will play one "K-O" against teams from their group, the first 8 may still become Champions, the last 8 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
nt|tomi2: south just shows a balanced hand with 6 clubs and probably 3@S and not a good heart stop. interesting what north makes with those information havin 2 hearts only too|pg||
nt|tomi2: should Olanski do something here?|pg||
nt|nagini: gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C=any invit hand 2@D=any GF hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tez: take @c play @h first..you can make it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H = invite, 2Nt=GF both with raise in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a interesting option|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tomi2: playing this method south was not able to show a good/bad hand. he has 3 kings and one ace, but could have had some queens and jacks|pg||
nt|tomi2: and since he opened 1nt on AKAK last hand he cant have more than this|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting choice by South to bid game with what loks like a lot of worthless black cards and bad trumps, the DQ as the only plus value - but lucky|pg||
nt|po-s: 3rd hand openings don´t deny an opening...|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|trotto:  2@d = ask , 2nt 6 clubs , 3 @d relay ,  3@s= 3226 = , 4 @d - end signal( call P for bid 4 @h) 4 @s  = game @s sign off|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: this 4@S cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 1@D shows hearts in their methods|pg||
nt|drewsky: where u gonna live ?|pg||
nt|drewsky: sorry, private|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nigel_k:  Since West has short diamonds there is a serious risk of going down with trumps 2-2 if you don't play them immediately|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Warren :)|pg||
nt|juror1: welcome Warren again :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4nt rkbw|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tez: nice start for declarer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: @DJ should do the trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North know A or Ax in S in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H ask the Q in @D|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nagini: nice|pg||
nt|nagini: - 1 only:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: it is Dariusz Kowalski|pg||
nt|nagini: wow|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: many bid 5@S = no Q, 5Nt = Q, 6@C = Q + 1K etc.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When declarer follows with the queen, the jack is a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now seven with K in @h|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nigel_k:  Good defence to continue trumps|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree with declarers line though it didn't work - this is usually the case only when I am declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like as S should have played a @s in trick2|pg||
nt|warrens:  trying for 7, but I don't think he'll make 6 |pg||
nt|po-s: if 3H showed spade values why did he ignore his heart values?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tez: we will see endplay soon|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42: maybe with good intermediates I would open it anyway - depends on mood |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, hard also 6|pg||
nt|tomi2: whatever their bids mean, they play a good contract rightsided now. he has one discard on @H at least and one on spades, so it does not need @D finesse. and with this lead he even ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: survives 4-0 trumps|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|nagini: dead  man:)|pg||
nt|tez: no need endplay sry|pg||
pc|d6|nt|warrens:  if declarer plays spades by trying to cash the Ace, he's down for sure, but I think he's down even if he plays towards dummy (assuming East ruffs)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he plays a spade, East ruffs and plays another trump.  now declarer has 5@D, 2@S, 2@H and 1@C.  can't even ruff one spade since East can ruff again|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|bridge_one: no way in all lines to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|warrens:  yes, win first trump, play a club toward dummy, take 3@S, 2@H, 5@D and 2@C|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 2@D a great bid !|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tomi2: 2@D might be a transfer to hearts, showing some at least mild invitational hand. playing this method 2@H becomes "GF in @D". quite popular in the Netherlands|pg||

nt|trotto: mandatory 4@h (and then pass on any bid of P) , while 4@c/4@h/4@s / 4nt are preferential blackwoods|pg||
