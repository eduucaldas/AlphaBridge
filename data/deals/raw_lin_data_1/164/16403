nt|Walddk4: Monika, could you please use a  'standard'   L   in East's name?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or simply  Pepsi|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  East's jump to 4@h was very aggressive with a void in partner's suit. At the other table East bid 3@h and played there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lead something and claim|pg||

nt|vbman: lets see the polish methods with that 19 count here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|tomi2: its just ana agreement I have with some partners. with nat nonforcing I simply lead a club vs 1nt and with a good hand I double and lead a club|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|tomi2: they will end up in 3NT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1@D  ;   1NT   18-20  ?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the other room made 3NT without @S stopper|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bridge_one: this 2@d must be a two suit hand|pg||
nt|juror1: Buongiorno Giorgio|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello Slawek :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphp2: sorry for problems, Kalita played 7 of spade the result is -3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, lead a card and claim|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @SA was led which blocked the suit, small @S would be -1|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  danger!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, not, if 3nt was alerted|pg||
nt|tomi2: Tuszynski - Kowalski have been playing together for many years, I bet they know their follow-ups to multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree with pass by West - the DBL means only points, for sure not long @h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C would be forced|pg||
nt|nagini: he will manage:)|pg||
nt|vbman: so 1 nt is weak?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Nige Kearney|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nigel|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this contract is much safer|pg||
nt|vbman: or 15-17?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14 balanced hands are opened 1@C|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  N knows partner has maximum hand with @h|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tomi2: west will need to decide what ace partner has|pg||
nt|vbman: and the rebid after 1 red suit is?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: passed hoping in 2 @s tricks - difficult to think North void in @S !|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 12-14 they start a "rescue" sequence and try to find a ceah major fit before 1NT|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|nagini: only nuclear weapon against this transfers:)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: But you bid a major over 1@D (0-7) if you have 12-14. Can be 3 cards|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|nagini: on this level they rarely bid without a reason|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is not natural. it may include "any 0-6 hand"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sfoxa:  next time it does no harm, but now E has the lead as described in a bridge book|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vbman: oh so thats the famous polish club|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nagini: mostly playing against them askin for drink:)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|tomi2: neither 1@C nor 1@D must be alerted in poland|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nigel_k:  This one looks like it was lucky to escape undoubled|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with seven @C the pass at 3@H is dangerous - in this sequence 4@C can be a strong hand, but only long suit - and with K@S sgl can pass at 4@S ...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Yes indeed, Kursat, very appropriate when we are in Poland :)|pg||

nt|tomi2: double sqzeeze, those guys dont get this wrong|pg||
nt|vbman: l have heard about lasocki before but not his pard|pg||
nt|tomi2: E/W are members of the Polish seniors team, having won lots of medals in the last years|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And N-S play for Lithuania|pg||
nt|tomi2: Lasocki used to be a top player in the 80's and 90's playing with Gawrys|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: at all level it is possible dont guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: ah yesss|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tomi2: North is a sponsor from Lithuania who plays in Poland very often|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|tomi2: 3@D is probably invitational. North has support a single but minimum and no aces. this time 3@D is the best spot for them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably they use DBL for @h and 1@h for @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: so there is no mistake in saying that poland is one of the top nations of bridge|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nagini: happy Appy:)|pg||
nt|nagini: a feeling in fingers counts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All roads lead to 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: Ciech. had a tough rebid with 5-5 inv.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the xfer at 1 level it is usefull to receive the lead from tha hand with points|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: well done finding the 5-3 fit in the 4th suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|juror1: welcome Tezcan Sen of Turkey|pg||
pc|d7|nt|nigel_k:  Opposite a weak NT game is unlikely and Qxx in opponents suit is bad|pg||
nt|vbman: can bridge teaching supply a living in europe?|pg||
nt|tomi2: remember, this is the Polish Premiere LEague, so it starts with a round robin event, but they will play KO matches afterwards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poland keep recruiting new players through hard work by a lot of people. The Polish junior players are extremely good, and they have lots of them|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tomi2: yes, especialy in Germany, we have lots of wealthy old people playing Bridge in their local clubs, who want to be better then their friends|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's our point of view|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D should not be some slamtry, both players were limited and made a non forcing bid to start with|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, 5@d might be only one down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: possible to make game here having Ax in both suit|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

pc|c6|nt|Gerben42: evening|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42: friendly @c break sees this home|pg||
nt|othered1: with everything very friendly from this point, GIB (who peeks) would likely make an overtrick.  Here, though, declarer is looking for the safest line for 4. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now easy to make 10 tricks, because A in @C must be in West, so small @C from dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vbman: l also very much appreciate the german national team|pg||
nt|tomi2: the main aim from all teams is to finish top 8 here in this round robin|pg||
nt|tomi2: thank you :)|pg||
nt|vbman: any co?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nigel_k:  At the other table South tried for game and 3@h failed by a trick|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As you can see declarer has no choice but to play for @sK onside|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but no communication to play this line having a loser in @d|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vbman: carry over?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s2|nt|tomi2: the guys were always happy to play events in Turkey, like Istanbul 2004 or other open events!|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|tomi2: there will be carry over but not significant, most important is, that the top 4 teams need to win 1 match only to get to semifinals|pg||
nt|tomi2: and if they lose they get a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|vbman: and u bet they do very well, burrying opponents|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5-8 teams first need to win among this group and then against one of the 1-4 losers|pg||
nt|vbman: seems fair enough|pg||
nt|tomi2: but any of the first 8 teams may become Polish champion while the teams ranked 9-16 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|tomi2: with the 9-12 teams having similar advantage while the 13-16 teams will have to work hard, if they don't want to play in 2nd devision next year|pg||
nt|vbman: blew some tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: the "Katok" team basicly consists of players from Belarus and Lithuania, but they were welcome to join the polish league system and made their way throught the lower leagues and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: are constant members of 1st devision|pg||
nt|vbman: they have polish nationality?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tomi2: east tried not to joker around in teams, thats good. a small heart would have cut declarer from the club tricks, but he took the safer way for -1|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tomi2: its always difficult for "outsiders" to identify the teams, because neraly all of them have companies as sponsor, so their teams are called so|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|s3|nt|tomi2: no, but they are member of polish bridge federation|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nigel_k:  I suppose doubleton king with East is also possiblee|pg||
nt|tomi2: he can play for spades 4-2 and doubleton king behind the queen|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|vbman: so its ten now|pg||
nt|tomi2: since you get reduced entry fees by beeing member it pays off to become member, if you plan to spend 3 or more days per year in Poland and play Bridge :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|nigel_k:  But East has a 1@d overcall and West has a pass regardless of who has the king so you would normally play for it to be with the long spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer knows East's exact shape now, just not the size of his remaining spade|pg||

nt|tomi2: in 1 N tried to support partner with 3@S, in board 2 south started with a double and ot 1NT|pg||
nt|nagini: hard to stop before 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: most of the teams we see this weekend are from Warsaw|pg||
nt|vbman: so how long does it last and how many times is it held in a year?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tez: 5@c is not so bad|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: true Dany :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you start with 2 weekends rond robin, this is the 2nd one, and then several KO matches. The finals will be held in may|pg||
nt|vbman: no 3h will be the limit|pg||
nt|tomi2: the winner will represent Poland in the next European Champions Cup|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|tomi2: in 3 N went directly to the major game not trying for 3NT and in 2 they tried to invite balanced instead of going towards a @D contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: odzywka praktyczna|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well bid|pg||
nt|tez: double dummy play..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for bridge players it is important to have good gadgets after 1ANY pass pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H after dbl 17+|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nigel_k:  3NT needs partner to have something in hearts, but making 11 tricks in diamonds needs a lot more|pg||
nt|nagini: want to play hearts? not a good idea:)|pg||
nt|vbman: oh my|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S by Vainikonis tends to promise 5 spades in Poland|pg||
nt|tomi2: they like to make "heavy" 1@S bids on 4 spades and some points|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tomi2: wow thats some double swing|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C hit the jackpot here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tez: 2@c dbl was not penalty for sure|pg||
nt|vbman: so north hand is close to 1sp or a q|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 3@c with west hand..you?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello everyone!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duking the D risk Q@D @d ruff losing after the K@D|pg||
nt|vbman: taking the low road resulted well|pg||
nt|vbman: if they played in nt it wd be a 15 point difference|pg||
nt|vbman: operator what are ns talking now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: felt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: my asistant says ''we say "side suit first" :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most of the breaks will be because most Polish players smoke - so they need a short time in such 12 board matches|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tomi2: even if he went down it would gain lots of imps since NS made 4@S over there|pg||
nt|pfbr: "assistant" :)|pg||
nt|nagini: personally I would choose  pepsi a pd|pg||
nt|vbman: smoking kills|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: in vuln normal 3@h opening|pg||
nt|nagini: one condition only: as my sponsor:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: light openung|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: the best movement for the players was "4-board BAM swiss" so they had to wait for the other results and couls smore every 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: players was talking about previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: pepsi has a feeling in fingers:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad controls isnt worth 12|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but I by today's standards, it's pretty sound -- a couple of 10's, and a couple of honor tricks make up for the acelessness.|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, if you can get them to take a phantom save, vul, it does have its merits.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42: good correction to 5@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if partner cannot open 2@S, probably the suit is insufficient|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: 2@D of course is multi - long @h or @S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|othered1: Effective double by north.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be worried about @C now|pg||
nt|othered1: He can hold this to -1 with the right view on the minor suit positions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but might take a wrong view on the auction|pg||

nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0541.JPG this is Vainikonis|pg||

nt|tomi2: again some "Hamman" 3NT try, this time stopped by west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: wow|pg||

nt|nagini: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
nt|vbman: push board|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: am quite suprised that Russian did not bid 2@D after 1@S - that is a GF relay promising at least 3 card support in @S and enough for game|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
nt|tomi2: skipping the 2@D relay often indicates a) not such good 3 card support and/or b) a better heart suit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bridge_one: this to give the possibility to defend knowing a minimum of 3 cards |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|tez: is it real or need undo|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/liga/liga2010-11/pierwsza/LIrunda10.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Gerben42: retransfer, thanks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tomi2: since they are GF now 3@D shows some interest, north has two aces, maye he will try for slam|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tomi2: if south had a better @H stopper and not such great fit, he would bid 3nt over 3@C directly|pg||
nt|tez: ty Monika|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so 420|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer may not read the lead as short, but it shouldn't matter as cards lie|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then South will also score his @H10|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|po-s: what if South doesn´t have the club king?|pg||

nt|othered1: or do thy lead rusinow?|pg||
nt|vbman: thats ok for me now thanks all and good luck to players|pg||

nt|tomi2: thx|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, he gets a small heart anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can score @H10 as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: small spade to the king|pg||

nt|Gerben42: perhaps they will show their 1@C 1N system again|pg||

nt|bridge_one: in the previous hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: No ideal bid for Kalita here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess one has double although that would indicate four spades|pg||
nt|tomi2: he could cash @S before to have 9 tricks for sure and finesse later or catch the singleton queen and play @S10 and then the other spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: here 4@S ON also with A@C and @C lead because opener will play A@S and @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = 3 cards raise|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sfoxa:  that was the way, yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 3@H with 4cards raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is limit +|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: @c leads beat 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|nigel_k:  Some pairs play that double shows spades and 1@s denies them|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No game makes for N-S but that's because South has no opener (in my view)|pg||
nt|nagini: sped for to be down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Otherwise hands like North have no good bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|frankaus: agree - only 25 zars - do u like zars  - i'm a fan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like popcorn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: zars the same as smarties?|pg||
nt|frankaus: zar's hand evalution system  - link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I stick to the 4321 scale but I am no fan. It is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|tomi2: Let me try to introduce the format they are playing here. This is the Polish Premiere League. 16 Teams play a compleate round robin on thwo weekends, so they will finish sunday but ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: then the "fun" will start. The field will be torn into groups of 4 - basicly its most important to be top 8 after sunday|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: but we are sure he will lead @d ace or @s ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: normal lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a kinitz told me 2NT is GF|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|tomi2: then the teams will play one "K-O" against teams from their group, the first 8 may still become Champions, the last 8 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
nt|tomi2: south just shows a balanced hand with 6 clubs and probably 3@S and not a good heart stop. interesting what north makes with those information havin 2 hearts only too|pg||
nt|tomi2: should Olanski do something here?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tez: take @c play @h first..you can make it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H = invite, 2Nt=GF both with raise in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a interesting option|pg||

pc|d9|pc|s5|nt|nagini: 6 cl 1370 only:)|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  when defence would have started with A @h and @h, declarer would be in trouble|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tomi2: teams, who finished higher in the RR have some carry over, and most important, the top teams may affort to lose one match in beteween|pg||

nt|warrens:  if declarer plays spades by trying to cash the Ace, he's down for sure, but I think he's down even if he plays towards dummy (assuming East ruffs)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|warrens:  if he plays a spade, East ruffs and plays another trump.  now declarer has 5@D, 2@S, 2@H and 1@C.  can't even ruff one spade since East can ruff again|pg||

nt|nagini: so have some food:):) ty:)|pg||
nt|trotto: e.g. if the opener has distrubution like 3-3-1-6 and the last answer to relay was 3@h, then 3@s = rkcb on @c fixed (because @c are the longest) 3nt to play, 4@c - rkcb on @s fixed ...|pg||
