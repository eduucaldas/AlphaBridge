nt|ralfwil: hello Mike!|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@c looks like asking for trouble|pg||
nt|othered1: might it have been a transfer bid, just a weak raise in @D?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|petergill: I think it was 11 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Scoring is IMPs, so overtricks are not vital|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: par here is of course 5@sx for 300 to N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: two clubs to take - can NS find the diamond ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: now that 5@c is not an option|pg||
nt|lestergold: very good score for e/w therefore|pg||

nt|petergill: Sorry, my mistake|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry 6@s can go 3 off still a save against 5@h|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: 5@s i meant |pg||
nt|mdgraham: no need for the diamond ruff, in fact - South has two natural diamond tricks|pg||

nt|petergill: Who thinks that North should or might bid 3@H over 2@S?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|panja: hi all|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: hi Prakash|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|panja: Hi Mike|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: i thionk a 7 card suit needs to be shown |pg||
nt|mdgraham: with Jxx of clubs in support of partner it's not unreasonable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s-1 will be worth plenty of mps|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|panja: how about a dbl of 3@S from South?|pg||
nt|lestergold: risky with only doubleton @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: +50 worth 12/66 for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: A bit risky, with only Kx in the unbid major|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd be afraid of 4@H by partner on a less auspicious suit if I doubled|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I don't want to quibble but  they did need the diamond ruff to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: If not 3@H by N over 2@S, then 3@C by North - must support with trump support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Win the trump switch, take a second round, heart to the ace, ruff a heart, play  a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: right.. so the question is, how risky is 3@H by North?|pg||
nt|lestergold: then at l;east South could double 4@s it being mps|pg||
nt|chessmaste: If South wins he is endplayed. If he ducks you play a heart and pitch a diamond to endplay North. |pg||
nt|lestergold: the question is how risky is it not to bid 3@h |pg||
nt|panja: when EW haven't found a fit....3@H is quite risky, mitigated by a fallback to 4@C though|pg||
nt|petergill: Mark's point - that 4@s was cold after Trick 3 - is excellent|pg||
nt|othered1: At matchpoints, sometimes my partners overcall with fewer playing tricks than south holds.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you won't always be able to cash two clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he has overcalled vulnerable and you have support for his suit and 5 playing tricks in ur own suit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South knew North held three clubs and did not play the jack on the second round - a small inference perhaps that he had no interest in hearts  |pg||
nt|petergill: The sequence of play recommended by Mark (chessmaster) is logical and leads to 10 tricks in 4@S |pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SJ653HQ7652DA98CT,ST987H84DQJ76CJ63,SAK42HAJTDK542C98,SQHK93DT3CAKQ7542|sv|e|nt|panja: with AK A, and @HK...and opponents having found a fit....South'b dbl of 3@S is perhaps less risky as an action by itself, but if it is going to encourage a 4@H bid with much less, ...|pg||
nt|panja: it is not so great|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@Sx-2 was a very common result  |pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wcurrently lying 15th|pg||
mb|2C|an|stayman|nt|chessmaste: An old chestnut here - Transfer or Stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Previous hand: When South discards on the 3rd round of @h's, North is known to have 7 hearts, 3 clubs and thus only one diamond, so discarding a @D on that trick is good play. |pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: and now, 4@S is cold with no wastage in N hand opposite @C stiff..but they didn't seem to have a way to spot it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: 30 point pack as it happens for n/s with the lack of wasted in clubs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 4@s looks pretty cold|pg||
nt|petergill: If South invites with 3@S over 2@S, should North accept, with his useful-looking minimum?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|s5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|panja: not at MP, not at IMP fresh..so I guess through 3@S would not be a possible route|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North's hand is better than it looks - all the honours in long suits. |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence have attacked @ds in time|pg||
nt|panja: only because of South's stiff @C..had South held a stiff @D instead...it might not be so good|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: +50 worth 48/66 for NS|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|petergill: so you can see there that 50 to NS was very good for NS on Bd 5|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C Transfer|pg||
nt|lestergold: with both missing ks favourably placed 12 tricks are likely for e/w in either spades or no tgrumps the no trumps of course outscoring|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this dbl risks a @C lead away from @CAx...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four 720's already!|pg||
nt|lestergold: not surprising|pg||
nt|panja: on a small @H lead against 3Nt..|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes A@h gord to bed if not led|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i mean if not played on first hearty|pg||
nt|lestergold: one way or the other|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: 2@C should have been artificial..marked..looks like a Drury|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not quite, but North must not duck a heart at any point|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: 690 on club lead (unless Andrew Robson can sneak a heart past the ace)  or 720 on heart lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panja: unlikely North will duck a @H now...|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: by notm leading a heart n/s should earn a top|pg||
nt|panja: seeing all the @D in Dummy..and knowing @S finesse is working|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Diamond to the queen, spade to the queen, low heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: after the next two tricks North will know not to duck a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: he should be able then to virtually count declarer for 13 tricks if the heart is ducked|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chessmaste: Its not Mike Lawrence|pg||
nt|panja: a low Heart right away will lead to a duck..but which West will want to do that after the Club lead?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|lestergold: no way hose|pg||
nt|petergill: 690 would give EW about 75% of the matchpoints|pg||
nt|lestergold: u mean n/w i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s|pg||
nt|panja: also...either of @D or @S might have been ducked...so an early play of @H is unlikely..|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I mean EW|pg||
nt|petergill: Lots of 680's|pg||

mc|11|nt|lestergold: +4 surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: plus four|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he claimed more than 600, more like 720|pg||
nt|petergill: 660 would be 75% for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: robson wanted to be surfe no one waas ducking any Ks before trying the heart|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4!n puts the pressure on its nop a guiessing game at hiogh level|pg||

nt|mdgraham: just what South expected....comes back to him at the 7-level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|petergill: But East could not see a 2nd trick, hence no Lightner Dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Robson has to double and take his plus now|pg||
nt|othered1: north now knows of @C duplication because of south's pass showing first round @C control|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh opted for a forcing pass shopwing club control|pg||
nt|petergill: South's Pass of 7@C should show 1st round club control, which South has. |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: alfrey does not like that as he also has a club control|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: pass possibly requested double|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: there's a 5@sxx-3 - 1600 EW|pg||
nt|panja: at IMPS, 7@C is a clear bid....you don't want to risk -1430..at MPs, 7@C bid will probably get you close to Top or Bottom|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c5|pc|d9|nt|lestergold: i do not see why east bid 7@c he has a definite trick if partner can be encouraged to lead a club and pard i pretty likely to have a trci kin defence with a vul 4N bid|pg||

nt|petergill: Tony Forrester (Eng) and David Herman (USA) have taken the lead in the event. |pg||
nt|lestergold: too strong for an immediate 1@s must tell partner whose hand it is|pg||

nt|panja: althought I see a possibility of 12th trick..on run of 3@H and 4@C..S might have to bare his @DJ|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D looks like a "mini-multi", one long major, very weak hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl looks like a psyche|pg||
nt|lestergold: prssure play and good card reading may be needed to bring in 6N my feeling is that it will fail at most tables|pg||
