nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|diablo666: Actually 10 in clubs normally just mean that you don´t like the suit, rare with Lavinthal in these positions in Sweden.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is interesting - SUCTION - one suit in @H or two suit @S@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|paulg:  Walker is *thinking* in the other room Roland|pg||

pc|h7|pg||

nt|greerm: Willie has also represented Northern Ireland at fencing in I think the Commonwealth Games|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzxe: Fredin asks about the auction so far|pg||
nt|bobholl: now their @C system migth prevent them from reaching @C|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobholl: why not 2@H and 3@C ?|pg||

nt|vinbtech: and gen it gets beat by 2 tricks as declarer has only 1d+4c+2A= 7 |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|diablo666: Don´t even think Fredin can make this one interesting..., not even if NS reach the 5-level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: NS playing magic diamond, a system based on 8-11 openings|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: in pairs i would bid but now ??|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: where is the 9th trick coming from (we can see that a lot of options work :))|pg||

nt|garnetts: well played :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
nt|paulg:  the play on 19 would have been uninteresting, we can live without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: figured as much :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|1D|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes and about as difficult to make as the last one |pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
mb|2C|an|Majors|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: double explained as promising 3 @Hs|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|greerm: seems a simpel 1 off, anyone see anything lese?|pg||
nt|justin c: too early for difficult contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Give us Man Utd|pg||
nt|bt: what are the chances of that roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Non-existent|pg||
nt|bt: seems board 23-24 are slightly favorable for skara|pg||
nt|bt: well skara is winning here so|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Looks like the same ten tricks too|pg||
mb|3S|nt|diana1: very hard for Vi to imagine that Charles has also 3 losing @hs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|xenya: but this might make|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|bt: the natural play works|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|diana1: so early on in the match she is probably going for what she thinks is the safest thing|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|Walddk3: Maybe you could tell the audience where in the world Skara is located (other than in Sweden)|pg||

nt|bt: i dont know?|pg||

nt|diablo666: Skara is about 150 km northeast of Göteborg.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|chessmaste: leadign from a king is dangerous - but it looked logical enough from the bench|pg||
nt|justin c: 1@D-4@S maybe|pg||
nt|garnetts: The j@D was also attacking --question which is best|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxz: IH double checks his 1S card this time...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|garnetts: 5@D looks logical now --maybe 4NT then 5@D over 5@C say to suggest a slam interest |pg||
mb|1N|nt|bridge_one: playing for finesse in @C need however to try, first, the @S ... no money for see if @S are 2/2|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: E must have known he was giving up the chance of ever getting his A@h so he was relying on partner to have a lot of tricks|pg||

nt|garnetts: Kx looks like a dead holding --so why bother---West might have re booted this and then the double really costs |pg||
nt|justin c: very speculative double|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He is lucky his @D K is a trick - or is he? If East held the ace 6@D would be making.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|diana1: so he can afford to throw a @s and a @h|pg||

nt|paulg:  I'm told that Scotland will probably play this in 2@s, as they use 2@c for this type of raise|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hi Roger - do u know where find the CC of players ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxd: N-S is playing 1@C 16+, 1@D natural, 5c M, 2@D multi, 2M = 10-13 6+|pg||
nt|greerm: 3NT by NS now|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Another easy game here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would be pretty annoyed giving away 150 for no reason |pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Nope, sry. Staffan will check it out...|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c shows diamonds, or a 5-card major with 4-card minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  they have been very solid since the accident on  22, probably give them confidence for the rest of the weekend|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: not the world's best 4 card minor|pg||
nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  there could be blood if East doubles|pg||
nt|sheila a: Lindsay may be wondering if partner has @s|pg||
nt|garnetts: If I had been west it would have been 400 |pg||
mb|1C|an|16+|nt|greerm: or 4@H maybe|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|up to 8|nt|bridge_one: ty staffan|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  wow, that is a big pass by East|pg||
nt|sheila a: I guess most would play x as pass or correct by E in this situation?|pg||
nt|diana1: it really is - has to do something|pg||
mb|2D|an|not sure|nt|greerm: 2NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: takeout double here, will lead to 4@H by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: good barrage by NS |pg||
nt|garnetts: well does east absolutely promise four hearts?  I think not |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|forced|nt|greerm: that might deny 2@H in which case N will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes in these auctions someone just has to bid notrump even with Jxx|pg||
mb|p|an|was dbled|mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: many pair use the open of 4@C, in first and second position, with long suit in ! closed and A or K out - here the advantage to play natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: i meant bid 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: same hand a heart less and spade more--what would you do?  |pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  this is unlikely to take long|pg||
nt|justin c: @h can still be right in 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good point - double cannot guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: with short @H hand taking the @S force|pg||
nt|justin c: agreed, X covers a lot of ground|pg||
nt|justin c: not a lot else East can do with quite a lot of hands here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: long suit in @H|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: note the force of intermediate cards in the trump suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|diana1: double is probably the best thing as he is happy enough if his partner passes or bids spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might not make either --needs accurate play |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulg:  given the carnage that may ensue, this is probably the safest spot for EW|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|chessmaste: The 4-1 heart break is a blow for declarer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He must now change tack |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sheila a: maybe he was worried that he had insufficient defence if partner was quite weak??|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: that will mean he gets the @D length right though--so a @D to the K --simply play the k@D first then lead towards  the ace |pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  except opponents are already limited, so can easily be your hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is on track now|pg||

pc|c2|nt|garnetts: Just out of curiosity waht would an initial 3@S show?  |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|justin c: presumably a stronger hand than this|pg||
pc|c5|nt|diablo666: West showing extra values with no short suit, a bid that shows a positive attitude towards life :) .|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only 1 key cards in East, perhaps better 4@S over 3@D (but i don't know what means 3@D, could be conventional bid)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I am not sure a simple 2@S is right on the East hand - maybe 3@S - unless they think that is weak|pg||
nt|garnetts: or weaker?  |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|greerm: standard lead with 5 trumps |pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|justin c: i dont know the EW bidding methods here|pg||
nt|justin c: but i think that 3@S would be a strong 1 suiter|pg||
nt|justin c: question is whether this is 'strong'|pg||
nt|justin c: it is if your p promises to produce the @SK and an A|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The other question you need to ask is if I bid 2@S will partner pass on many hands where we have a play for game?|pg||
