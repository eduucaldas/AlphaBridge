mb|1D|mb|p|nt|diablo666: Actually 10 in clubs normally just mean that you donÂ´t like the suit, rare with Lavinthal in these positions in Sweden.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is interesting - SUCTION - one suit in @H or two suit @S@C|pg||

pc|d7|nt|bridge_one: in IMP competition need to be more safe|pg||
nt|justin c: speaking of quality, this 3NT contract lacks it|pg||
nt|justin c: horrible contract, but neither N nor S can remotely put a red card on it|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nothing exceptional here|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@c is a brave call as Sime was not guaranteed a fit (Matheson might hold five hearts for example)|pg||
nt|greerm: helpful lead|pg||

nt|diana1: hi all and welcome to the first match in this year's Camrose series - the home internationals|pg||
nt|sheila a: South's hand is pretty poor but NV she figured it was worth a pre-empt|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed 1@C MUST HAVE BEEN FUN TO PLAY BY EAST|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: not so bad, when you suspect that the opponents can make a game|pg||
nt|xenya: and this also looks interesting|pg||
nt|dburn: and declarer may get the clubs right here - another of these intra-finesse things|pg||
nt|steveray: may need some work to get to 9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|dburn: moreover, he knows where all the cards are|pg||
nt|steveray: @h back surely|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may incline to play East for @cK doubleton, rather than West for !JX or @c10x|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|steveray: odd choice of @hQ|pg||
nt|steveray: thought he would preserve entries to that woeful hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|s7|nt|dburn: well, if the defenders play a third heart he won't have an entry anyway|pg||

nt|Walddk4: What was the contract and result on 17, guys?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OK; done|pg||
nt|paulg:  we have seen a lot of two-suiters tonight, perhaps the theme of the weekend|pg||
nt|greerm: 3C+2 by Norht on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: ok we are back! lost the play on 19, sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: well played :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
nt|paulg:  the play on 19 would have been uninteresting, we can live without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: figured as much :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|1C|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes and about as difficult to make as the last one |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: If NS get to some number of no-trumps there is a classic intra finesse position in clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
nt|justin c: y indeed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: double explained as promising 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets see if they can do it in defence |pg||
nt|justin c: close to 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: this will tell us |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|greerm: seems a simpel 1 off, anyone see anything lese?|pg||
nt|justin c: too early for difficult contracts|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Give us Man Utd|pg||
nt|bt: what are the chances of that roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Non-existent|pg||
nt|bt: seems board 23-24 are slightly favorable for skara|pg||
nt|bt: well skara is winning here so|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chessmaste: Looks like the same ten tricks too|pg||
pc|d9|nt|diana1: very hard for Vi to imagine that Charles has also 3 losing @hs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|xenya: but this might make|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|bt: the natural play works|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|diana1: so early on in the match she is probably going for what she thinks is the safest thing|pg||
nt|paulg:  all the reasons are there to make North declarer on this hand, but it just did not work here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that west should bid 1@D rather than pass--playing a system where 1@C can be short alolows you to respond on garbage when you have short clubs  |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|s3|nt|bt: did north just discard a winner?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|xenya: home now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could play also @S for the A and small @C at the Q|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bt: no probs yet for skara but ...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|justin c: with @S1098 can afford to try the @C finesse, still safe |pg||
nt|justin c: going a few off in a 3-2 fit at 100 a trick is an expensive business|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|pc|h9|nt|Walddk3: Maybe you could tell the audience where in the world Skara is located (other than in Sweden)|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like E needed to play a diamond early to set up 7th trick for his side|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know?|pg||
nt|bt: where is it?|pg||
nt|bt: :-)|pg||
nt|diablo666: Skara is about 150 km northeast of GÃ¶teborg.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bridge_one: for north need to find A in @C in East - then now @D is correct|pg||
nt|bt: close to Ã¥mÃ¥l, of movie fame?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bt: "f.....ing Ã¥mÃ¥l"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|diablo666: Nopr, wrong side of Lake VÃ¤nern :) .|pg||
nt|bt: wrong side of sweden also :-)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4 imp|pg||
nt|bt: 17 and 18 coming up are exactly what skara wants|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  would everyone double 3@s? Or is a risk you just need to take?|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Dan Neill|pg||

mb|p|nt|greerm: 3NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: but the chances of doing so were dramatically improved by N endplaying S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: this theme came up in the first set--do you guys think 1@S is best or 2@C?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|diana1: very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: likely to finish in a partcsore --1NT or 2@S |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@C for me|pg||
mb|3N|nt|greerm: not the greatest dummy but has chances|pg||
nt|greerm: in theory 4@C 2@S 2@D and 1@H |pg||
nt|greerm: can the defence chalenge that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 3NT or 4@S here i think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@S is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i don't think they can, but a few concerns for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  the upside is that West may not have a cue bid available|pg||
nt|garnetts: Norman did well to avoid 2@C |pg||
pc|h4|nt|greerm: he that hesitates is lost ?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bt: we had an undo. makes more sense now. maybe there should be a bid for the west hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like 2@c as well|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: well I agree I much prefer 2@C |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|justin c: for one thing, 2@C to be followed with 2@S is more economical than 1@S then 3@C, as here|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|justin c: intra the @S suit :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes I forgot we all overbid here nbecause we are such great card players these days |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will not be easy - at the very least needs an intra finesse in spades  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sheila a: I think if partner bids one major have to use the other as a cue|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Always easy to overbid from the commentators seat|pg||
nt|garnetts: If plays the intra he likely looked --he will surely try and ruff a club and try ace and another spade|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I suspect he will struggle whatever he does|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|garnetts: He surely did not play the Q@H  |pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: yes :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A cunning fasle card Mr B. |pg||
nt|justin c: helping declarer to finesse the @H10 later|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe that is a better idea than helping partner--|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: 2@C by W would have been the winner, but perhaps that is not allowed by their system|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: He must be so glad he played that Q@H now |pg||
pc|c4|nt|bt: people usually dont work much on 1X-(1N)-?? in their system, pretty common auction|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|greerm: looks like defence can make it difficult but not quite difficult enough|pg||
nt|greerm: @C now only postpones it|pg||
nt|paulg:  a club now would force declarer to guess the layout|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: N/S have @D, greter that @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: and does show the five four shape you actually have--C plus S  not the other way round |pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|mc|12|nt|garnetts: he has to play a club --no option |pg||
nt|chessmaste: No reason to play the king here - unless you are on declarer's side|pg||
nt|garnetts: and it almost makes the intra finesse a possibility --just because of a false card--strange game |pg||

mb|3S|nt|greerm: a spirited dbl by I H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bridge_one: another push board|pg||
nt|diana1: pity Burns didnt bid 2@c to show sme sort of a weak hand with majors as then Lindsay may have found a 3@s bid which does very nicely|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps H & H |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: 5 imps to England for playing 3@D instead of 3NT brd 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts:  I think 3NT after 3@D likely shows 4-4 majors and that leaves 3@H as a relay|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@h, i am told, denies 4@H but does not promise 4@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bt: and if skara wins they qualify for the champions cup or whatever its called, i think|pg||
nt|justin c: make of that what you will :)|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|sheila a: Yes, that would have worked better|pg||

nt|garnetts: an old fashioned 3@C raise--it used to be a transfer to 3NT (:)) but in good style strongly suggests playing in the suit|pg||

nt|paulg:  With more than half the set to play, a test of character for them now|pg||
nt|justin c: another flat game....|pg||
nt|garnetts: annoying hand since he could have led any card and it would make no difference |pg||
nt|garnetts: Thats my kind of lead problem though |pg||
mb|1D|nt|diana1: so it wouldnt surprise me if the other E/W pair find their @s fit on that last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  West removing socks to count points|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the other room they're playing strong NT so would open 1@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bt: this is the type of slam you want to be in when it makes|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure about declarer's line though -- playing on spades rather than clubs looked better|pg||
nt|justin c: not a lot of imps going to move around on these first boards|pg||
nt|garnetts: true- nothing to say is there?  |pg||
nt|justin c: possible 4@S here|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT likely ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: i thought this was the 1@S = i have 13 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S suction - so one suit hand in @C or two suit @D+@H|pg||
nt|justin c: East hearing a lot of bidding, considering his hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I would bid that now |pg||
mb|3N|nt|justin c: if I think of anything, will let you know|pg||
nt|djneill:  short and to the point|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: kinda both hands actually|pg||
nt|paulg:  and a weak 5-6 hand with a void in partner's suit is probably not what you were looking for, but things will improve|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: NS clearly keep 1@D to show at least four--so 1@C maybe tow|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: @C and @D+@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2NT shows 22-23 balanced|pg||
nt|sheila a: N couldn't be blamed for leading a @h against 3NT, which won't be a great success|pg||
pc|c3|nt|garnetts: back to my usual comments about opening bad 11 counts |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulg:  could be blamed now :)|pg||
nt|diana1: yes probably or else he is upgrading his hand and showing the normal 23-24|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|greerm: 6-5 come alive |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|paulg:  2NT is a minor pre-empt, so they may play some form of kokish|pg||
nt|djneill:  David are you saying that East can use the information from the opening now to find the big honors?|pg||
nt|justin c: 9 imps to wales for making 3NT on brd 20|pg||
nt|justin c: intra finesse in @C, as predicted|pg||
nt|justin c: (east doubled the opening bid, making that the indicated line)|pg||
nt|garnetts: partly yes--also it makes life hard for partner knowing when to compete--and also leads to too many abd contracts |pg||
nt|garnetts: no objection in third seat though |pg||
nt|justin c: certainly reassuring on this board to know the @HA is in S, so you have an entry for @S tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: there was an earlier hand where North had a nine count after partner opened but did not compete on board 19 |pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: 4@S with A A and Q of trump is conservative|pg||
nt|bt: y i agree, was a sweet hand|pg||
nt|diana1: yes I think they do|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Vi knows this is from 3 she can duck|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|paulg:  still only four tricks for the defence ... really need to lead both blacks suits to trick one|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think South can consider many things here, it is hard to know which is best|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|bt: i assume west didnt splinter because of @CA singelton, and east then assumed no shortness, thats the only explanation for 4@S on such a prime hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  and, naturally, continue both blacks suits when in with the diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: well a @D was |pg||
nt|garnetts: it would have inconvienced east --make him need to get hearts right I think |pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: EW using reverse attitude|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|paulg:  it's clearly a very good hand when partner shows four in one of your suits|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|justin c: this is where the auction helps him|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Ax in @D is very strong figure over 2@d by West|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|diana1: sometimes though it is hard enough knowing which suit to play never mind knowing which TWO suits to play at once|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

nt|justin c: heres hoping :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chessmaste: Meckwell make a living bidding this type of 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  how it's not clear that you can make 4@s anyhow|pg||
nt|greerm: an offbeat 1NT with 54 in Majors|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@C for me here |pg||
mb|3C|nt|toobad: must be playing 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: IH suddenly realises he has pulled 1NT by accident|pg||
nt|paulg:  West about to bid an invitational 4NT?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT or 4@H ?  |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D = 6-9, 4+ card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but you can probably get more from 5@h-X|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think you can if you pick every card, and the strong bid from N helps|pg||
nt|djneill:  brd 23 other room same auction, same result|pg||

nt|greerm: Ian Hamilton, also known as maddoc |pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: so i guess 1@C-3@C is something truly awful|pg||
pc|h7|nt|greerm: spec tells me 1NT was 15-17|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like to get in and out quickly with this hand type--3@C makes them find fit at that level 21D might let them in more easily |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  2@c was 5-card stayman|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with Mark 3NT looks like a good shot now |pg||
nt|justin c: needs a @S lead i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: six solid and a rag outside |pg||

nt|sheila a: The Outreds routinely open light so Vi has to invite with her 12 count|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All over for the defence now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: playing 3Nt instead 4Nt is a advantage|pg||
nt|greerm: out alive :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice auction from West ... this must show some slam interest with no diamond control|pg||
nt|justin c: grab this, pitch a @S on the @CA, and pull trumps|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bt: can discard a sapde and a club, what next|pg||
nt|diana1: they are obviously playing transfer responses to 1@c here and the 1@s bid denies 3@hs |pg||
nt|paulg:  not so obvious I'm afraid|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@ss rather|pg||
nt|justin c: there are preemptive raises, and preemptive raises|pg||
nt|justin c: not a bad idea to give p a clue what is happening|pg||
nt|justin c: for instance, he has 18-19 bal, and needs to know whether to bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs asking - 1@C showed 3+ @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: true--if he has then bid it in my view--having all this extra system burdens the mind for the play and serves leiitel useful purpose |pg||

nt|justin c: @H10 i think|pg||
nt|justin c: planning on forcing the S hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  @h would kill a red squeeze against East in some situations (@hA is communication)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  1@h shows any 12+ and 1@s shows 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|diana1: I know that David and Rex in the other room do |pg||
nt|paulg:  then 2@h is a transfer to spades followed by invitational 2NT|pg||
nt|diana1: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: some work needed here|pg||
nt|paulg:  this would not be a good hand for lead of 10 showing 0 or 2 higher honours|pg||

nt|chessmaste: leadign from a king is dangerous - but it looked logical enough from the bench|pg||
nt|justin c: 1@D-4@S maybe|pg||
nt|garnetts: The j@D was also attacking --question which is best|pg||
nt|garnetts: this was weak defence by west --|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|justin c: even 3 rounds of @C accomplishes something|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxz: IH double checks his 1S card this time...|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 5@D looks logical now --maybe 4NT then 5@D over 5@C say to suggest a slam interest |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|bridge_one: playing for finesse in @C need however to try, first, the @S ... no money for see if @S are 2/2|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT again|pg||
nt|justin c: how will this one go on a @S lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: needs care on a spade lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  3@c is 9-12 HCP with 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|garnetts: It did not occur to me that North might double |pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: E must have known he was giving up the chance of ever getting his A@h so he was relying on partner to have a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: needs to duck a @D to west |pg||
mb|2D|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant -- cash two high spades first|pg||
nt|justin c: hope he can see how to beat this, I sure cant|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: how does one do that?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: exactly--was being ironic |pg||
mb|2N|nt|justin c: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|diana1: the play here shouldnt be too difficult although no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Kx looks like a dead holding --so why bother---West might have re booted this and then the double really costs |pg||
nt|justin c: very speculative double|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He is lucky his @D K is a trick - or is he? If East held the ace 6@D would be making.|pg||
nt|garnetts: you get away with this to an extent when the opps forget to use the blue card |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: Ian needs to play @H for 1 loser, with no clues?|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  South was hoping North could bid NT, maybe with Qxx, better sided|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|greerm: more natural to play first @H from the table which will mean 1 off|pg||
nt|paulg:  i can't see any|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|diana1: so he can afford to throw a @s and a @h|pg||
nt|sheila a: Best defence is to cash A@s and then exit with a @c, but will S know that?|pg||
nt|justin c: will play @D from S twice, |pg||

pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||

nt|paulg:  I'm told that Scotland will probably play this in 2@s, as they use 2@c for this type of raise|pg||

nt|diablo666: Hi|pg||
nt|djneill:  other table East bid 2@s vulnerable, whew|pg||
nt|garnetts: brave bid--and got rewarded |pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S only here|pg||
nt|garnetts: THis type of hand could be dealt with by opening 2@C and rebidding 4@S maybe |pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: Hi Roger - do u know where find the CC of players ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxd: N-S is playing 1@C 16+, 1@D natural, 5c M, 2@D multi, 2M = 10-13 6+|pg||
nt|greerm: 3NT by NS now|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Another easy game here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would be pretty annoyed giving away 150 for no reason |pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Nope, sry. Staffan will check it out...|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c shows diamonds, or a 5-card major with 4-card minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  they have been very solid since the accident on  22, probably give them confidence for the rest of the weekend|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sheila a: not the world's best 4 card minor|pg||
nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  there could be blood if East doubles|pg||
nt|sheila a: Lindsay may be wondering if partner has @s|pg||
nt|garnetts: If I had been west it would have been 400 |pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: or 4@H maybe|pg||
nt|garnetts: unless some oficious busybody tells me its not allowed these days |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: ty staffan|pg||
nt|justin c: Erichsen agrees with you, anyway|pg||
nt|justin c: we will find out if Selway does presently|pg||
nt|garnetts: so it appears --I am humbled :)  |pg||
nt|djneill:  Selway related to Soloway?|pg||
nt|justin c: easy to reflect with that N hand that you have a trick or two for a partner who can make 4@S without your help|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  wow, that is a big pass by East|pg||
nt|sheila a: I guess most would play x as pass or correct by E in this situation?|pg||
nt|diana1: it really is - has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 2NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: takeout double here, will lead to 4@H by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: good barrage by NS |pg||
nt|garnetts: well does east absolutely promise four hearts?  I think not |pg||
pc|cK|nt|djneill:  West is feeling not bad about setting chances, for a little bit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|greerm: that might deny 2@H in which case N will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes in these auctions someone just has to bid notrump even with Jxx|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many pair use the open of 4@C, in first and second position, with long suit in ! closed and A or K out - here the advantage to play natural|pg||
pc|c3|nt|greerm: i meant bid 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: same hand a heart less and spade more--what would you do?  |pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  this is unlikely to take long|pg||
nt|justin c: @h can still be right in 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good point - double cannot guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: with short @H hand taking the @S force|pg||
nt|justin c: agreed, X covers a lot of ground|pg||
nt|justin c: not a lot else East can do with quite a lot of hands here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: long suit in @H|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|justin c: personally, I am not wild about opening 2@C on hands like this|pg||
nt|djneill:  and there it went|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: note the force of intermediate cards in the trump suit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|diana1: double is probably the best thing as he is happy enough if his partner passes or bids spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might not make either --needs accurate play |pg||
pc|s7|nt|justin c: i think you need defensive strength too|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  given the carnage that may ensue, this is probably the safest spot for EW|pg||
nt|garnetts: unlucky if you venture into the five level |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|djneill:  best defense is a good offense, so South has a lot of defense|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chessmaste: The 4-1 heart break is a blow for declarer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He must now change tack |pg||
pc|d4|nt|sheila a: maybe he was worried that he had insufficient defence if partner was quite weak??|pg||
nt|justin c: outvoted as usual :)|pg||
nt|justin c: problem one, north has no idea when he should bid on over 4@S here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: The late John Collins first used this idea--and i thought he was right when I first saw it and still do |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: that will mean he gets the @D length right though--so a @D to the K --simply play the k@D first then lead towards  the ace |pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  except opponents are already limited, so can easily be your hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is on track now|pg||

nt|garnetts: well actually the sequence 2@C 2@D 3@d is always difficult |pg||

nt|justin c: for many, this denies a M|pg||
nt|djneill:  East was not expecting to play this one|pg||
pc|s5|nt|diablo666: West showing extra values with no short suit, a bid that shows a positive attitude towards life :) .|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only 1 key cards in East, perhaps better 4@S over 3@D (but i don't know what means 3@D, could be conventional bid)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I am not sure a simple 2@S is right on the East hand - maybe 3@S - unless they think that is weak|pg||
nt|garnetts: or weaker?  |pg||
nt|justin c: (using 2@C-2@D-3M as 4M and longer @D)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||

nt|justin c: but i think that 3@S would be a strong 1 suiter|pg||
nt|justin c: question is whether this is 'strong'|pg||
nt|justin c: it is if your p promises to produce the @SK and an A|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The other question you need to ask is if I bid 2@S will partner pass on many hands where we have a play for game?|pg||

nt|justin c: of the first 7 boards, 6 were flat|pg||
nt|justin c: slam decent here for EW|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: 3@D 14/15 no shortness (this inf., by kibitz, so TY :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yup--that is why I do not like 2@S |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|chessmaste: Whenever West has modest spades he will be likley to pass, even with decent high card strength.|pg||
nt|garnetts: There was a case for a penalty double of 3@H --but usually you cannot do that as west |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|h2|nt|chessmaste: That is why I would be inclined to overcall 3@S - then partner does not have to worry so much about trump support|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: would either of you be tempted to open 1@s?|pg||
nt|justin c: (available from all good bookshops :) )|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: South has a fine multi--North does not--an offensive weapon should not have two cast iron defensive tricks --and also the three cards in spades is an issue |pg||

nt|justin c: (the one where a @S went on the @CA if you didnt cash @S immediately)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think it was a well deserved swing then |pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  solid opener from Vi Outred that shows a limited hand with either clubs or diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: are you thinking of 1@d, Paul?|pg||

nt|paulg:  3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|toobad: fit jump?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|paulg:  2@s showing a 3-card limit raise is very popular with the 5-card majorites here|pg||
nt|garnetts: we do try to argue for leads we really would make and not just those that work when we can see all of the hands |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  very hard to bid 3NT when the opposition show hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: is everybody playing transfers?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|justin c: 2@C = 4@H and another, or 5+@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: 2@H, just @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@C appears to mean I have a long suit somewhere |pg||
pc|s4|nt|sheila a: the auction does kind of suggest @h are 4-4|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless 1@d was a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: 1@d might have been a sort of responsive double|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, or just denying a 5-card major?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Vi wondering if there are 9 on top|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd be wondering if there are 7 on top|pg||
nt|sheila a: Charles has bid quite strongly but clearly there were other, stronger bids he could have made|pg||
nt|diana1: as you said before Paul it is easy when we can see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  if there is one leading style I abhor, then it is MUD in partner's suit|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|justin c: @S leads here?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulg:  a lot depends on what the redouble showed .. it may have been diamonds or a range|pg||
