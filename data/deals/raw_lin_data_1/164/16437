nt|bjacobs: "odd" is putting it mildly|pg||
nt|roswolf: the manual bill|pg||
nt|golfsquash: A chance here for NI|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: Presumably, there were some artificial bids, and they knew what they were doing, but as it turns out, they've missed a good game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: 4@H may be the final spot|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They will do well to get there - it doesn't look too easy|pg||
nt|roswolf: also the spade sac looks cheap|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It can go down 500 on best defence ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 100 or 500|pg||
mb|3S|nt|golfsquash: Not so cheap if they get 2 diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Maybe 5@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: North is forced ... he's going to have to bid 4@H or 5@C ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: trying the lower level|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So this will be 7 imps to the Northerners|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|cuttysark: Best to avoid 3NT here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play a home-grown strong club system known as the Delberto Club |pg||
nt|idc: The 1@h was alerted - it is natural but may conceal a longer @d suit if fewer than about 11/12 hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: one of the players filing a fingernail|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I won't say who|pg||

mb|3N|an|minors|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|georgia19: 3nt of course, is cold - as usual|pg||

nt|sheila a: 4@h looks fine|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome everyone to this 3rd round Camrose match between England & Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: North in his box|pg||
nt|idc: Nice try by Brian Short to shut out West but Derek Patterson doesn't know the meaning of "shut out"|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: diamond ruff may loom|pg||
nt|idc: The names as they stand are mixed up but better to get the first hand details right - we'll correct the names when we have time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable for West to bid both his suits - he has a fair hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: it's a pity 3@c didn't promise all those clubs - S would have raised then|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: not a nice easy board to get the brains going|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk7: Good morning Ralf and Bertil|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: Hard for East to realise that partner has an entry - but if the queen is dropped he should fins the switch|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sheila a: declarer can ditch second @c on a @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But then North can cross to @HA to discard a club. Oh well|pg||

nt|athene: esp on a saturday morning :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|georgia19: Patterson/Crouch had a brilliant first half and obviously mean to continue|pg||
nt|idc: I know some players who might rebid 3NT with the North hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: so do I|pg||
nt|idc: Not that I'm saying it is right, just that it is this time|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

mb|4C|mb|d|nt|golfsquash: already past the best contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west judged the auction well in the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps this is why some people give up on 4 of a minor openings, using Namyats instead ... still the 3@C opening at the other table did seem inadequate|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: whoa, nelly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is not going to work out too well for North|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but he did not have an easy decision|pg||

pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Agreed it's not easy to decide between 4@D and 4@S!|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: sorry about the confusion, no defections as yet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might as well end it all now, Ian|pg||

nt|toobad: godd morning all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good morningJohn|pg||
nt|toobad: good even|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mikeirl: should be a flat board alright|pg||
nt|sheila a: Who knows the final scores from last night?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Welsh BU 18, |pg||
nt|cuttysark: bridge.silverexter.eu/results might have a clue|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: A link should be posted at some point|pg||
nt|idc: that's what prospective partners all say|pg||
nt|milton_se: welcome, John|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mikeirl: England 17/13 against Ireland|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have the EW system - weak notrump, 4-card majors is pretty popular in scotland but we will see|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: NS are playing a Carrot club (11-13 bal or 17+)|pg||
nt|idc: "no defections", heh, I like it Ronan|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose after the double you might finesse the diamonds but it's asking quite a lot|pg||
mb|3D|nt|idc: This is a fun-looking hand - can N-S reach slam?   and do they want to?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S is natural, possibly 4 cards in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 2@H natural is the way to play here|pg||
nt|steveray: afternoon, Bill, Ian|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: silvertexter|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: indeed, both Dbl and NT are available for the other suits|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose that makes more sense where people open 1@H with 10xxx :)|pg||
nt|justin c: if W can have 4 small, you cant get shut out with a good hand with @H|pg||
nt|justin c: as you say, lots of takeout bids available|pg||
nt|chick: oh, nevermind, it wasn't the opening bid :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes NS play 2-way 1@C opener, 14-16 nt, upside down carding|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Hi Steve & Bill|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it was sime who was thinking there|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to take some hundreds|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: matehson experimenting with the 3-card rebid at a bad time - Sime also a bit pushy|pg||
nt|sheila a: I don't like the look of this contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxx: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
nt|sheila a: thanks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Somehow it seems that the 4-3 fit attracts bad breaks more often than ot should :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: South hand may be too short of entries to make this a good one|pg||
nt|georgia19: wonder how many they'll make, apart from the (normal) @d break, everything is perfect|pg||
pc|h2|nt|milton_se: very timid pass by South|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: EW are strong notrump, 5-card majors, weak-2@D@H@S, standard count, upside down attitude|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think I prefer 2@d from Sime's hand - if partner has 4 @h it's easy for him to bid them|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks like all it needs is a 3-3 break and @CA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: John having a think now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: about playing @sQ?|pg||
nt|milton_se: tell him it's too late :)|pg||
nt|toobad: team instructions!!|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|athene: garvey decides 2@D is a nice spot to stop - of course with his partner being a passed hand there is less danger of missing game, passing a transfer|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I don't mind the double - but perhaps East should just bid 2N, or West settle for 3@H|pg||

nt|athene: you never get rich beating NV contracts a bunch, not doubled|pg||
nt|georgia19: but as predicted (or not)  too many tricks for comfort|pg||
nt|idc: South could raise 3@d to 4@d but I think passing 3@c is right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@d from S. so N can bid a 3nt if possible|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|sheila a: Garvey-Carroll play a Polish Club style so this shows @c|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks like 3NT from here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|steveray: 3nt here|pg||
nt|idc: WHich only leaves North's 4@c - partner has come in vul v not after both opps have bid, so should have a decent 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2N presumably a game-forcing enquiry|pg||
nt|mikeirl: par score battle|pg||
nt|mikeirl: *part|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anyone agree with me?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: 2H is enough even for law aficianados|pg||
nt|peachy: with a defensive trick|pg||
nt|justin c: i see a @C a @H and 2@D for NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: garvey: "If I was playing with someone else I might have XXed"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sheila a: forcing with support or balanced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D=0+@d, denies 6m unless 4M, as here|pg||
nt|georgia19: so where will this one end.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c=art FG|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mikeirl: no defence to beat this|pg||
nt|sheila a: 3@c = minimum|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South worried about the diamond stopper|pg||
nt|sheila a: I presume partner could have asked about majors if he wanted, so his cards should be in minors|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|milton_se: well judged|pg||
nt|peachy: I suspect Dbl was takeout oriented|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes well timed and really good defense to beat game double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Walker has shown 12-15 bal|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: It seems you can ake 6@C by ruffing finesse against @DA to pitch 2 spades|pg||
nt|sheila a: I wouldn't want to be in it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: 5@H has good chance to make|pg||
nt|milton_se: and no double - very cheap save|pg||
nt|chick: who should double? :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|justin c: doubleton @CQ in the pocket, and the @HK right|pg||
nt|idc: To look on the bright side, we'll see comparisons for those first 2 boards soon enough|pg||
nt|georgia19: as you can see, 13 tricks are available in @c's or NT, but needing both finesses for that , they'll probably settle for 6|pg||
nt|milton_se: close choice between 3@D and 5@D|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: I expect it was bid as sac, insurance against potential making 4S|pg||
nt|justin c: friendly layout for dec|pg||
nt|mikeirl: would be uncomfortable on a spade lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: for any specs new to BBO vugraph, use the 'Movie' feature to follow progress in the other table of this match|pg||
nt|georgia19: BRIGHT side Ian, are you sure?|pg||
nt|georgia19: first board must have been bad for the Scots|pg||
nt|idc: Yup, beats waiting for 2 hours if you start in the Open room - don't mind losing IMPs, it's the waiting I hate|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: might make 12 tricks - for example on a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: Jxxx isn't all that appealing but if you think neither opponent has four, it's not so bad|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: declarer will be happy|pg||
nt|steveray: certainly not a testing contract to play|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Assuming 4@D is a Splinter, North cues? Or worried about his spade stopper?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to avoid being forced to open up the hearts, if they want four tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sheila a: It's an odd sequence if S really did show minimum and N signed off in 3NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: ah now it makes more sense|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if North couls sign off in 4n?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s=no singleton or void|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: Spade lead really the only one to give a problem - guess at trick one|pg||
nt|sheila a: Early gain for Ireland - Scotland played board 1 in the no hope 3NT |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a correct save as EW can make 4@h|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzxx: crouch not sure what 4h is|pg||
nt|georgia19: only a spade gives nothing - or a trump I suppose|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: safe now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a tad kangaroo at the end|pg||
pc|hT|nt|milton_se: would certainly as West. knowing tehe|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Pigot for Ireland stuck in an overcall - perhaps showing both Majors? and the fit was lost|pg||
nt|idc: Well, even if Peter wasn't entirely sure about 4@h this still looks well bid|pg||
nt|georgia19: is that a new bridge expressiion, mike?|pg||
nt|idc: Combined 27 count with some wasted in @h and they still get to a good slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the Kangaroo Klub - a bit leapy and jumpy (and possible Skippy as well)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: but it could be next step if EW is in 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Carroll now querying who's granny Tommy would be playing with to XX|pg||

nt|mdgraham: England made 5@c on board 17|pg||
pc|c4|nt|milton_se: there's no freak distribution|pg||
nt|bigtrain: doesn't have the comm to eliminate @D for the throw in|pg||
nt|idc: The Open room starts with Bds 15 & 16 of course, so this room is 2 bds ahead|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: putting West on lead against 3NT might have been fun|pg||
nt|justin c: the trouble with playing in @C is that East is on lead|pg||
nt|justin c: and suspects @H better|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: No -2|pg||
nt|idc: well, I did mention that only 1 spade ruff was needed - great though the defence was I suspect that Peter will feel he ... could have done better|pg||
nt|georgia19: all down to a bad decision at trick 1 with both finesses working, he declined one|pg||
mb|1D|nt|peachy: I think it "should" mean "nothing. With spade support and values, defending looks promising|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, I agree|pg||

mb|1N|nt|peachy: I've got to run, thanks Bertil, Cornelia, and all kibs. Enjoy the rest!|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Raija @H@H!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This opening bid should get them to 3N, another contract I think I might make|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: 2@d is different: natural weak for Scots, undisciplined multi for English|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: 4@H for EW|pg||
nt|justin c: likely to be allowed to play there at this Vul|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: a boring 3nt here|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: the Northern Irish are playing a form of Standard American|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: the southern Irish are playing carrot club|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chick: NS can make 3N on a good day|pg||
nt|athene: south still has a very soft hand; he won't want to go past 3nt surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: John pondering|pg||
nt|milton_se: would you bid 4@H with that flat hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No only an invite|pg||
nt|toobad: he will pass............ v slowly|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|peachy: Ace of spades, as pretty as it is, in this auction is not pulling its weight|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: comfort break for east|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 4@s is a correct save|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: could even be opposite partner;s void|pg||
nt|chick: .|pg||
nt|steveray: howsat?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: a cheeky smile and a 2d without his screenmate from sime|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxx: and we back|pg||
nt|milton_se: y at most 500|pg||
nt|toobad: finds the s bid now when unsafe rather than when free, but it works|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sheila a: 2@h = 3 card support|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This Irish pair open very light, but they will still reach 4@S - not a gimme|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: another thing is if you bid a game with som invite bid, you often will have no save|pg||
nt|milton_se: well judged|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: now Ian having a think|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|steveray: I thought Camrose was played without screens, am I behind the times?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: north doesn't have a very nice 15 count but it is 15 and since he has presumably shown 12-14, he has to bid this|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: looks like a screen from here|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: Cant blame W for giving this hand a look|pg||
nt|steveray: in the good old days when I played there were no screens in Camrose, even after they were used in other events|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That changed about 5 years ago|pg||
nt|steveray: tx Roland, I never knew:)|pg||
nt|idc: And they use paper-like cards now Steve, not those stone tablets anymore |pg||
nt|steveray: I thought it was all done virtually, with computers|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Needs the K@s onside|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now needs an intrs-finesse in spades - not the odds line|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (apologies for the poor typing)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: typing is fine :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And he probably does not have the entries anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with correct play 5@s is only -500|pg||
nt|toobad: this is what happens|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: this is safe because declarer's spades are just strong enough|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! 5 rounds of @c will give a trick to @sK!|pg||
nt|milton_se: not obvious to drop @SK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|justin c: @DA inatead of @DKQ in E|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: sry 4 rounds|pg||
pc|c2|nt|steveray: in fact it would be cheaper to play the Camrose online - good idea eh?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: He does now|pg||
nt|athene: at worst east can win the @HA and play the @S9 back, but you just cover, and the @S7 means you are never going down|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||

nt|toobad: i doubt it was really a joke|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: much more fun to play for a squeeze than a finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@s=sound in 2nd seat and 1st vulnerable|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mikeirl: 3nt by S looks reasonable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: will take a swipe at this i guess|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: also you have the advantage that if you take the finesse and it fails, you lose more tricks|pg||
nt|idc: I expect you were providing commentators with an opportunity to say something intellligent|pg||
nt|georgia19: well NOW you tell me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and this one can hardly be described as sound |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as before, 1@d=0+diamonds|pg||

mb|3H|nt|chick: I dunno, can't expect to get too many spade tricks|pg||

mb|3N|nt|sheila a: play should be fairly quick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and, wonder of wonders, 1@s is natural |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this was an auction where both sides tried to make the opponents take the last guess|pg||
nt|georgia19: what does he bid with @d's?|pg||
nt|georgia19: opener, I mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: the last making contract was some way back|pg||
nt|steveray: this could go off or get let in:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: sometimes hard to follow at the end of hands when they play in a blur|pg||
nt|milton_se: one finesse and a 3-3 break needed despite 26 hcp|pg||
nt|toobad: if Carroll's hand was 2533 would he really have given all that thought over 4H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: screens in use - W Hamilton could have been thinking about his 4@s, no?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: i would have thought most would open 1@H with that east hand|pg||
nt|idc: good news for declarer: they didn't cash @s|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, no harm done|pg||
nt|idc: bad news: still too many losers in pointed suits|pg||
nt|athene: tricky to play - maybe cash just two clubs to get rid of one spade, then lead spades up to take advantage of @SJ onside? trying to have the best of both worlds|pg||
nt|milton_se: and also: Carroll might have 1-5-x-x w @SJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|justin c: would rather put a red card on 4@S than try 5@C with N|pg||
nt|chick: I thought 5@D from N would have been better|pg||
nt|georgia19: c'mon Mike, what's the answer?|pg||
nt|idc: 1NT rebid I guess|pg||
pc|h5|nt|steveray: if Selway could see all 4 hands, he would be thinking it was a bit hopeless, but could try 2 rounds of clubs then try a @d|pg||
nt|idc: If there was a convenient entry to East hand I like that Bill, but there isn't|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|chick: Interesting auction, but they've ended up where everyone else will |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: claim after 1st lead|pg||
nt|toobad: you're forgetting we have read all the ROI books Peter!!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|justin c: they arent making any overtricks when you have that lot, but can easily be drifing one or two off|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: I am not sure what the West suit length implications are here - not sure if West has shown five diamonds  |pg||
nt|georgia19: I thought you'd gone off for a dram, Ian|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: yes, bit short of entries to hand, i agree|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and he did so|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|idc: when I say 'guesss' - am reading their CC and 1NT is 11-13 and possibly singleton in partner's major|pg||
nt|idc: which implies they can have unbalanced hands for 1NT rebid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|justin c: 4NT for N, if you must bid anything|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might duck this trick as well to rectify the count for a possible squeeze on north in clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|idc: he may be hoping for clubs 4-3, trumps 3-2 and a slow spade trick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c5|nt|athene: but not very likely since a) it would need north to have all three heart honours and b) the defence could break it up with a heart shift anyway|pg||

mb|1H|an|8+, possible canape|nt|athene: now west has to decide among pass, 4@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has to show that singleton diamond somehow though|pg||
nt|steveray: so where would we like to play this one, 5@c, major moysian,??|pg||
nt|idc: true - can they avoid matchpoint NT-itis though?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: quite possible that south will just suggest notrumps at some point and north will go along with it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that will do, usually|pg||
nt|georgia19: apparently it's Bandol, is it my birthday?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: E might have slam aspirations, but he doesn't have a bid to show it|pg||

nt|athene: saying i have nothing wasted in diamonds, facing the shortage|pg||
mb|2H|nt|peachy: 7 controls, 5-card good major and 5-4 sort of speaks in favor of trump contract, but opposite that dummy, 3NT is best|pg||

nt|chick: hmm, wrong again, I have to admit, I'd at least bid game|pg||

nt|diumraid: For Live In Running Scores at all tables got to http://bridge.silvertexter.eu then "browse results" then 1o3.txt|pg||

nt|athene: i don't fancy either major-suit moysian, with the wrong hand getting forced|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeirl: another flat board|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: probably 3@S was a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|justin c: either to play there or the start of some minor suit slam try|pg||

nt|steveray: Hi Paul, belated Happy New Year|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|athene: south has a huge hand for a passed hand, facing short diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Perhaps EW should just shut their eyes and bid something over it|pg||
nt|athene: lucky clubs aren't 5-2 otherwise three rounds of clubs would promote a trump for one down|pg||

nt|georgia19: now what? small spade?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: off fetching teas and coffees|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|idc: If so, there's a lot to be said for forgetting about 4-3 fits where the lonmg hand gets forced, so 3@h & 3@s here may not be natural |pg||
nt|paulhac:  As he may have to ruff diamonds the percentage line is to play East for the Q unless he can get a count|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|steveray: not the obvious @d lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: I got confirmation from kib that 3S indeed was the only way to stop in 3NT, it asked opener to bid 3NT|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3nt with only 4 @c tricks to the defence|pg||
mb|2C|an|non-promising stayman|nt|milton_se: can they avoid 6D now?|pg||
nt|idc: South could splinter (4@c) but has more playing strength than usual for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so maybe it was a bit trickier than it appeared|pg||
nt|idc: plus a good diamond suit, so I doubt he will splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Interesting 3@s - maybe 3@d would be NF|pg||
nt|georgia19: I don't agree: splinters only in oppo suit - prefer 4@d, fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: Blackwood in a minute, one suspects|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|idc: I'd love if Crouch bid 4@c but ... |pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: It's almost too good for a 14-16 NT - this hand should play well|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lucky the club finesse works - a diamond switch now will ake him sweat|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or a spade and another heart|pg||
nt|sheila a: declarer's problem is entries to dummy but in practice the defence can't keep him out of there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or 4@h on 4-3!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|milton_se: good brakes|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he is getting totally killed here|pg||
nt|athene: best is a club lead now to get a heart back through the jack|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 4@s looks like rkcb|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: any other defence and declarer can get a heart away on a diamond|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|milton_se: 6D is makeable though, unless S or H lead :)|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now wants to finesse both black suits but with no entries it's difficult|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you take a club finesse, hoping for the @SQ to fall and @CQx or @CAQ tight onside?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Even without the bad splits, 4@s is a ropy contract|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: (declarer entertains mad dreams of making the contract of course - little does he know!)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|athene: can just build a club now|pg||

nt|toobad: i would have fancied David Greenwood to make that, but unfortunately they didnt bid it|pg||

nt|athene: so, if your opponents are playing a system like this, you really have to be on firm ground in the bidding, otherwise you are going to lose a lot of imps|pg||

nt|georgia19: I find that SO hard to believe: I remember the most obscure bits of our system and I am no where in the class of these two - guess tiredness may play a part|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interestingly, 2@c thru 2@S=natural, 2N thru 3@h=transfer|pg||
nt|georgia19: that's very normal these days Mike|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: that sure ruined South's pretty hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jtr: Wow Kokish overcall|pg||
nt|athene: you would expect a simple 4@S overcall from north, given partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|idc: This month's Bridge World mentioned playing East's 3@d rebid here (in a free run) as a forcing 3@c bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: sound 1@S overcall|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: would you pas 1@s with S hand?|pg||
nt|athene: it all seems unlikely :)|pg||
nt|toobad: best lead for def again|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sheila a: @s won't play as badly as all that, especially if the force in @h is avoided|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: it's a good auction but not on these hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You doubt that Marta is doing the right thing??|pg||
nt|sheila a: Short gave hard thought to making a game try; Walker gave none to declining it|pg||
nt|athene: repeated trump leads normal against this sort of contract, but they aren't hurting it|pg||
nt|steveray: not a triumph for support doubles|pg||
nt|athene: if double was support (3 spades) it does look odd to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S didn't promise five, did it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: East says i suppose i could have bid 4d|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Shame on you!|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|chick: very bad hand to try and get a ruff|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: well, enterprising bidding by West, then |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marta made an error in 1991, not a single one after that|pg||

pc|h9|nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: well a simple 3@D over 2@S looks normal enough|pg||
nt|athene: even without erudite agreements :)|pg||
nt|steveray: does he believe  partner has another trump?|pg||
nt|athene: he probably just decided that a) west might well have 5+ spades and b) even if he doesn't, 4@S could be the right spot|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: home in a way, but 6@D was a nicer property to live in|pg||
nt|jtr: The whole bidding has dry rot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This auction is perhaps not textbook, but it is correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I've just noticed that cards A@s is swaped with k@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West would surely pass 1@S with his hand, opposite a partner who has passed |pg||
nt|ady: the auction seems odd  1@S overcall?   then re-opening with the west hand   and the opening1@C?   can anyone explain|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it is differs with bbo layout, but other cards are fine|pg||
nt|mdgraham: er, no|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think we have a Mystery|pg||

nt|roswolf: i would have doubled but perhps east should have offered a choice of suits?|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|hQ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He can cross ruff high for 100% safetly here, and I think he might do so|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk6: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT  for running scores|pg||
mc|11|nt|golfsquash: Good morning all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But of course, when clubs turn out to be 3-3, there's the overtrick|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi rory|pg||

nt|sheila a: It appears that E opened 4@s in 3rd seat on board 12|pg||
nt|athene: 4 imps sorry - they were NV so only 50|pg||
nt|athene: i would open west a 20-21 or 20-22 2nt|pg||
nt|toobad: lost the tempo|pg||
nt|toobad: he was home|pg||
nt|golfsquash: needed to exit in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Which made sure of not missing game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well that gets the job done!|pg||
nt|idc: to be fair to me, I was looking at the screen through a red mist ... sigh|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E should have won on dumme and used his last @s for a thorw in on N|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: director back, 3 minutes now|pg||
mb|1C!|an|10-13bal or 17+ any|nt|athene: lots of aces and a 5-card suit - not even minimum for 2nt in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: A very excellent job by our vugraph operator Marcin!! |pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: thx|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: 6@S  on a finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: err...|pg||
nt|ady: assuming no heart ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: replay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: action replay, no less|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jtr: North cant move|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if he does he will find out that they are off 2 keycards|pg||
nt|sheila a: Sime's opening ran the risk of keeping NS out of a non-making game|pg||
nt|mikeirl: imps for Scotland on Board 28 - E/W are in 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: you might even consider rising the @HK here, to start clubs from the right side|pg||
nt|athene: on the grounds that the spades are more of a worry than the hearts anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: True|pg||
nt|justin c: double at other table, looking for @S lead|pg||
nt|sheila a: It looks like an opening bid to me, to be fair|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: sry, lost connection|pg||
nt|georgia19: we seem to have got to the last board skipping a lot - now what contract gives 29 imps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: it went down here for a while, scots in 4h + 2, maybe 6 on|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: then they let out a 1nt|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: I agree - these 5-5s just have to be opened|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sheila a: Feisty double from Matheson|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, they got every chance to stay out of it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Singleton in partner's suit and a trump trick - good combination|pg||
nt|sheila a: But Sime is thinking .....|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: Yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He pulled a double yesterday to a game he just might have made - hopefully he has learned something|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 5@D is trouble!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|sheila a: Phew!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Best to trust partner in these situations - gives you the shouting rights|pg||
nt|sheila a: That's the danger of doubling for one off - you give your partner another chance to bid :)|pg||
nt|idc: Two specs have asked the sensible question about the defensive carding last hand|pg||
nt|toobad: i suspect the hovering Director didnt help his play|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think Matheson is hoping for at least 2 down|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: normal to lead to a big one first with that suit, if you have enough entries to dummy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|milton_se: no way to nine tricks unless South lets go of a spade -- or they set up a H|pg||
nt|athene: gain against Ax onside or stiff jack offside|pg||
nt|athene: ok that was last i think? thanks all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good time to finish, this - almost Beer Time where I live |pg||
pc|c4|nt|mikeirl: leads to 15/15|pg||
nt|idc: All the scores in except this Bd - so well done to England on their win|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: While this hand is taking its twelve winners, a genreal point: |pg||
nt|chick: heart will work though|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jtr: Slight risk in taking the trump finesse|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Only half way, Michael, lots more excitement to come :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 13 Walker managed to make 2@s, despite the 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes - solid bridge played here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|milton_se: 10D is killing|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|sheila a: Double part score swing|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|milton_se: no! not any more...|pg||
nt|chick: I think he can still do it|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hT|nt|cuttysark: I note that Short did not open the North hand :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some of us play K for count and Ace fot attitude|pg||
nt|idc: so I should reply that I would encourage as North (high in their system)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sheila a: Does that earn him a brownie point from you?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: Half a mark|pg||
nt|mikeirl: will Garvey lead a low @C now?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|chick: S is squeezed in spades and hearts|pg||
nt|idc: but that I can't imagine not playing @hK at trick 2 as SOuth were I to decide to continue the suit|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: Better had, I think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: this was the last bd of the set, next set schedule after about 15 min break|pg||
nt|peachy: opearator, is that still the plan?|pg||
nt|sheila a: This match is very tight. Garvey and Carroll have played steadily|pg||
nt|mikeirl: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And thanks to Ronan for great operating under difficult circumstances!|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|milton_se: 3 clubs mashes South|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|georgia19: very gracious, Ian, nice to have your company but I think the English had the rub of the green|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|chick: noooooooo|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: W blew it|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also thanks to our excellent commentators|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: Georgia, Ian, Mike|pg||
nt|georgia19: night all, off to commiserate, newcastle out of the cup:(|pg||
nt|idc: Could be worse - I could be an Australian cricket fan!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and QPR too :(|pg||
