nt|roswolf: south will be worried|pg||
nt|mrt2000: what'll Robin bid, I wonder?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW made 120 in the other room, so a 2NT overcall would have been OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  curious decision to double with such a flat hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S is not an ideal spot|pg||
nt|chick: 3 cards in every unbid suit :)|pg||

nt|chick: well, it wasn't an easy hand at the other table either :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a good 3NT defeated by 4-1 @d break|pg||
nt|roswolf: if the axe had fallen - south would have some explaining to do|pg||

mb|p|pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|yorkbeach:  with spades 3-3, 3NT might make if the defenders block the hearts|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: and in my view declarer should get the @D suit right|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i guess it's quick run through|pg||
nt|mikeirl: assume there was more to the bidding than recorded :)|pg||
nt|steveray: saves time opening with the best contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: both pairs play strong NT and 5 card majors|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thats one way of retaining trump control :)|pg||
nt|justin c: temporarily, anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least your fingers move|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: S for a opening? Y|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm  for team rosters and convention cards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Have to avoid losing two spades in 4@H but defence may establish @CQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry just catching up|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ok|pg||
nt|steveray: hard to see this making|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  3NT is harder|pg||
nt|sybarra: S may enter the bidding this round|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodal f: Feel NS are in trouble|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes. D lead shoul beat |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the end of 3NT then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would like the see the bidding, i cant understand why they arent in 4@H|pg||
nt|steveray: assuming East opened 1@C South should not take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c "natural", ostensibly 5+ clubs and a major or 6+ clubs with enough to open the bidding|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh boy ...................|pg||
nt|toobad: a bit frisky by S at the vulnerability..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but being in third position at favourable is enough to open the bidding nowadays|pg||
nt|mrt2000: trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@C = nat, limited (6+ or 5C+4M)|pg||
nt|sybarra: havent gotten to card yet, is is some form of flannery?  (I may get killed for mentioning that word) |pg||
nt|toobad: a @H lead ducked by S woud have been really unpleasant for declarer|pg||
nt|toobad: short and sweet|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a discussion every partnership needs to have,  is 2 @D forcing by passed hand?  (I think not,  cue bid only force) |pg||
pc|hK|nt|milton_se: won't be happy |pg||
nt|pfbr: :(|pg||
nt|mrt2000: happier than if doubled!!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrt2000: N must have seen his partner's overcalls before|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: E? Who have the rest of the pints?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Could have been a interestin 6@D if opp was 1-3 at @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for North to act with all but one of his points in opponents suits|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for South - best is probably not to shift to spades, but it looks an obvious defence to follow|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|rodal f: Second best|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzxa: N thinking...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on that lead, this may only go 1 off|pg||
nt|milton_se: he might have feared that 4S was playable|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://bridge.silvertexter.eu/results/1O3.TXT for running scores|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: and down we go |pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||

pc|dK|nt|milton_se: East may still think it's making :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|nt|dburn: well, he followed it - but declarer didn't have any diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|dburn: and this has helped him keep control of the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: to the extent that if he can guess hearts, he will actually make|pg||
nt|rmb1: or discard a heart and ensure -1|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrt2000: not now  :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: 2 @H was both majors,  5-10 pts |pg||

nt|roswolf: there is a theory that if you have a singleton in their main suit there will be a singleton held in your main suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes Culbertson came up with that|pg||
nt|chick: is that superstitution or is there some probability reason for that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: a modern theory then    lol|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even Culbertson admitted there was no scientific basis|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  as Geoff says, a more reliable clue is to assume that vigorous opposing bidding means an increased chance of a shortage|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i have read in many books but i am not convinced 100%|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  is 3@s three suits short in clubs - a new one on me?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|yorkbeach:  must be given the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i expect so i play the same - it avoids silly 3nts woth a 2-/ fit in a suit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so are you bidding the suit below the singleton?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|roswolf: with a 2/1 fit in a suit as well as bidding good slams|pg||

mb|2H|nt|rodal f: 2@S=force|pg||
nt|insia1: will they go to slam ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C allowing partner to judge what to do over 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA as well as @hJ on side  in 6@c|pg||
nt|milton_se: there|pg||
nt|sybarra: anderson showing good judgement, as much as he would like to be in red game|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: can subsequently promote @S10|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3@D showed a @H suit here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|steveray: but 5@H is cold on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rmb1: And NS judged to give up quietly ?|pg||
nt|justin c: if dec ducks trick 1, needs @h underlead later|pg||
nt|justin c: bit easier from where we are sitting|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 6@C to come|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: And the @C blowed away after the invit 3@D|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 10 or 11 tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Meddy:)|pg||
nt|steveray: North needs partner to play a club before the D@s are set up|pg||
nt|steveray: Diamonds that is|pg||
nt|dburn: one of these days, the English will lead trumps when declarer actually has some diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no great matter against a part score|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: well done erichsen|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: but will south lead @C?|pg||
nt|steveray: might the @D be a singleton?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: odds on to|pg||
nt|rmb1: North can afford to be passive, but this is the most direct approach.  Hopefully 4@C bid will reap its rewards now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might take his partner for a singleton @D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer would not allow @DK to win if he had the ace|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hopefully selway will work that out|pg||
nt|justin c: is the West hand not worth a strong @C opening?|pg||
nt|justin c: seen worse|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe they dont get to game even then|pg||
pc|cK|nt|insia1: good bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make S hand as main and nwxt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe|pg||

nt|egezzer: West is John Greenwood,Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe club lead ...after alert, which may have been "could be 2" |pg||
pc|d8|nt|pfbr: david greenwood|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: the strong variety of 1@c has a higher lower bound for Carrot players than for Precision players|pg||
pc|dA|nt|insia1: I think he will drop @C, after finess @D|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: 4@D cue perhaps?|pg||
