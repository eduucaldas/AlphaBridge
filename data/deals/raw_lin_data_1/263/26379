mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: 2nt may be a short suit trial bid|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi -here 3nt looks normal -in teams it is but should fail as both critical K's are off side|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  east saw 2 !k -in his hand -but still played low -not the best start |pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|ady: Gold likely to be in the action|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: you doubt that West will be taking much part in this auction - but Esst may make up fot that|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5D|nt|ady: 9 tricks for e/w in diamonds   so 5@D up to 5@D a good save if they can buy it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: S has what look to be good-fitting cards, though - may take the push |pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: The table screen is sticking. Anyone know carpentry?|pg||
