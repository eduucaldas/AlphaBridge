mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ady: big swing for DeBotton likely here|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Grand slam on a finesse here, which loses, and it was the contract next door|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  13 tricks if North has three hearts  but not if south does|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ady: north might hope for 5 spades with soth for the grand to be secure|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|CopeyJ: 5@C 0/3, and 5@H asking for @DQ now|pg||

nt|CopeyJ: X says don't lead heart i think|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: Sandqvist has the 5th diamond and the jack of spades, has done well not to just bid grand slam|pg||

nt|xenya: and, as you say, Markku|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: allfrey and robson play a lot of transfers|pg||

nt|roswolf: some danger in bidding the grand!?|pg||
nt|xenya: sure, still they will stop in 6 i think|pg||
nt|runnerup:  too mirror for 7 as you can't throw clubs away -or ruff any @h to shorter hand -so real danger can be to avoid grand|pg||
mb|6C!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes that is a grand try|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: bd1 the grand slam -1  was flat!|pg||
nt|runnerup:  they know each others 7 @d -1 a push and 4 @c played in both tables -so no risks that something will happen|pg||
