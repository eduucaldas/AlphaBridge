mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: good result for De Botton CR|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I am not surprised|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|ady: it looks like De Botton are going to win this|pg||
mb|r|mb|2S|nt|warrens:  e/w now getting into the auction, though I would think it unlikely that they'll get to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|paulhac:  Looks now as though it is the Alfrey team who is under pressure|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Steshome:  In south's defence, it's a 10-count and partner has opened and they subsided in 2@s|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, he clearly has his 3@H bid|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Artur does not know about the grand in the other room and may X looking for points or even bid 5@H|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@H goes down 1100 if they get all their ruffs|pg||
nt|smoller:  5@H to tie the board|pg||
nt|smoller:  oh, 3 club ruffs is possible|pg||
nt|ady: Robson doubled 4@S in south seat  in CR|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Do we know if the time penalty is in the score?|pg||
nt|Darrene2:  Yes it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|Steshome:  Well done North|pg||
nt|ady: dont thin north can lose much by passing|pg||
nt|warrens:  well done by Malinowski|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: pass brings in 5 imps   may be vital|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam made  in CR  brings scores level|pg||
nt|Steshome:  3 specs have commented that North would have been better advised to pass 3@s.  But I think once Forrester had bid 3@S, Gold was always bidding 4.|pg||

mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|wilkinsona: how about trying 4 spades, any good?|pg||
nt|warrens:  same start to the auction in the other room and S jumped to 4@H.  if X'd, that goes for a number|pg||
