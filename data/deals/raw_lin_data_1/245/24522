nt|rossoneri:  not sure if declarer can still set up diamonds in time though, but yes, could have been interesting|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The open room is in 4@hW contract.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: spade lead looks like the killing lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|MolvaM: otherwise declarer can play a small heart from the dummy and make 6NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: spec tells me that a @d was led|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|minimeck: 1nt p 3nt i reckon here |pg||
nt|rossoneri:  so Singapore has a lead of 4 IMPs after the first board|pg||
mb|p|nt|firechief: if the contract had been 7@c going down 1400 on an underlead in hearts, and two underleads in spades, then I would have congratulated it as well :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|minimeck: Indeed, that delicate defense would earn a spot in the bulletin :) I would have thought it hard to find a junior who wouldn't upgrade this east hand here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, we have got our first comparison it is 10 imps to Singapore as 4@h made its 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  This is going to be a 56 board match, so still a long way to go|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I see slams everywhere, but this one shall not be that case.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|firechief: nice bidding here to reach 3nt. |pg||
nt|malipivo:  The biggest problem are the clubs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|firechief: ya, i'm surprised it wasn't opened 1nt myself|pg||
nt|firechief: i believe they're playing 12-15 1nt|pg||
nt|minimeck: Hmm, that is even more strange in that case|pg||
nt|firechief: could be the reason...either that or 15-18.  actually, it's 15-18 i believe|pg||
pc|d3|nt|minimeck: In any case, west's unique path to inviting does the trick, some may simply bid 1nt on a 10 count but he did have 3 10s :p|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If declarer gets a non-spade lead, it is a close to making with a heart development his 4th.|pg||

mb|p|nt|firechief: i think they q-bid up the line.  I'm not sure if they play last train or not, so it could have been that north owed a 4@d cue.  not sure|pg||

pc|d2|nt|minimeck: Indeed, for those wondering, the last train option by north would be a final slam try (the bid right under your game contract) not necessarily showing control but continued slam ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: interest. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|minimeck: An interesting lead choice here, lead partner's suit, or your stiff|pg||
nt|minimeck: looks like the one opportunity to play the spade through has vanished|pg||
nt|firechief: yes, tough lead problem.  looks like everything should lead to defeat.|pg||
nt|firechief: only chance is sneaking a club past east, but i'm looking at all the hands|pg||
nt|minimeck: playing the hand it would certainly be convenient if the Q@d were onside, but declarer will likely conclude this must be a singleton, likely thinking about the hand in general|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: dwyer tempted enough to try 5c?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|malipivo:  The scoreboard show 2@h making, so operator probably lost play at some point.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *shows|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|firechief: fortunate that 4@h is a make here.  i would not have jumped to game w/those west cards|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  It can be tough to keep up sometimes when the players play at lightning speed!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|firechief: good poker i suppose|pg||
nt|minimeck: sometimes you just go all in and close your eyes and hope it works out, :p|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  (speaking from personal experience)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, I am just informing the audience, no offense meant.|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  I know :) Just giving my sympathies to our operator :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|minimeck: should be a quick -2 here|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|firechief: this looks like down 2, but there's a chance for down 1 if east doesn't crocodile his partner's spades late in the hand (but that's also only if the defense doesn't lead spades as ...|pg||
nt|firechief: well|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  Dutch NS stopped in 3@S on board 11 and made 10 tricks, so another 6 imps there|pg||

nt|malipivo:  We have got a new leader in that case.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|d6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  Again, for those who joined us midway, the Netherlands team has a 6 IMP carryover which is not reflected in the score displayed here.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is also playing 6@s (board 12).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Haven't they missed 3!n?|pg||
mc|9|nt|malipivo:  No, they didn't.|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  3 @Hs and a @D return kills it|pg||
nt|malipivo:  thank you|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  I think this is the end of the session?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, it is|pg||
