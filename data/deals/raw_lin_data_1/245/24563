mb|1C!|mb|1D|nt|bridgegoth: 1@C 16+|pg||
nt|galallie:  Same here, even though Jay may have smarter things to say :P|pg||
mb|2D!|an|C|mb|3D|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|galallie:  I believe the score is wrong. Israel should have the +10|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: E/W going a good job here getting into the auction. Vs Precision pairs, it is VERY important to bid whenever possible over 1@C|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: N-S failed to find their heart fit -- I wonder who should have done differently?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This really shows the value of getting in enemy way -- if no competition, I'm sure 4@H would have been reached easily.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: one of the problems of Precision, they were so high when they finally got started, it was too late to catch up, anything really is a guess at that point.|pg||
nt|galallie:  hearts is the much better contract. 4 spades goes down on the A of diamonds then the Ace of hearts and a ruff|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Actually they are ok with A@D lead, need A@H lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|galallie:  Ace of diamonds then the Ace of hearts?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|galallie:  hard defense to find|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: W ruffs with his natural trump trick, however a @S misguess can still set 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will be misguessing the spades, so I don't think the defense will matter.|pg||
nt|galallie:  Thats true|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: A spec suggested he may get them right by restricted choice once the T@S falls|pg||
nt|galallie:  A spec suggested that to me also|pg||
nt|galallie:  he has no choice but to play for the Q drop when the Ten falls|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: It's quite possible, if they are 5-1, you're in big trouble anyway|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: good point -- looking at the spade spots, that may be the right play|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|kit: Of course, suppose East plays 10 from 10x|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: @H back here seems clear, nothing else makes sense|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer isn't particularly worried about a heart ruff -- he has more important things to consider.|pg||
nt|kit: but hearts is suit declarer is attacking, so unnatural to lead it back.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: The other table is in 4@H and making easily|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|s5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: There is the ruff -- now declarer has to divine the spade position.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|bridgegoth: E/W have done well to make him guess|pg||
nt|agumperz:  Hello Specs and Commentators|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: he had to guess anyway.  I think he will get it right.  Spade 10 falsecard isn't likely|pg||

If battaggia didn't want to take the risk of playing three rounds of spades, he had better take in dummy and lead trumps to his hand, which makes a huge difference if north holds the singleton ace|pg||

mb|p|nt|minimeck: -50's|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well, he knows that even though his partner is at the max, they don't have the points for game, and he can smell a bad @S break with the double|pg||
nt|minimeck: slam is purely 50%, although better with the opening bid|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well, they were playing a contract with a bad break either way, so it may not be terrible|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  5@d from defenders?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, not today.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3NT mesns 16 19 6+S|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  looks very unlikely that declarer will get 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n looks makeable as diamonds are friendly distributed 5-3.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But also needs good guessing in spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Roger might try 3H instead of the more obvious 3NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In this deal hearts are sitting nicely.|pg||
mb|d|nt|johnjones:  This won't challenge W at all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: actually declarer can't easily make use of this extra diamond trick|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: open room also in 4@s, but played by south after a gadget in the bidding: pas - 1@d - pas - 3@c as 6+@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @c lead there, so declarer needs to get @hs right|pg||
nt|poohbear: No guess. Cant let South in|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h would go down one.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  welcome!|pg||
nt|asya13: Hi all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  He'll play HA, and a H|pg||
nt|hackenbush: then another diamond will put him to a decision|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Lee takes his time. In the last World University Bridge Championship, he took 10 minutes for a play decision in a slam|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Then he will go for several hands and play at the speed of light.  But when he thinks, it will be for a while.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is buying 5@dX.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  now there's a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  This is going down a few|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|johnjones:  A club lead will defeat 6.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have 4 clubs, 1 diamond, 3 hearts, at least one round of spades is expected for the 9th trick.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  And E/W had nothing their way, so this will be a good pickup for them|pg||
nt|asya13: Not a good bid by south vul|pg||
nt|asya13: might have not noticed he is red|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Has some help though with the non-Club lead|pg||
nt|asya13: Club ruff isnt going anywhere luckily|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I count 9 tricks on crossruffing, which would be a 7 IMP pickup for the US|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The crossruffing is fortunate with 4-4 breaks in both suits|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: revoke always difficult to handle as operator|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: because you cannot enter it (safety against misclicks)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with the revoke this will be 1 off, as director will give a trick to the defense|pg||

nt|malipivo:  and it continues there, 5@h-6@c-X|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|galallie:  Zach will bid anything Non vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|galallie:  something ive learned from playing with him often|pg||
nt|galallie:  but Vulnerable, you better have your bid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|agumperz:  i know Kit approves of frequent weak 2's|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I wouldn't have opened this one... i like somewhat disciplined in 1st and 2nd seat, makes partner's life easier |pg||
nt|kit: Yes, multi (or anything else) isn't going to create a great problem here -- in fact, if left on their own they might have gotten to slam|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: As it was, West was overweight for his 2NT overcall|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 1@D 1@S 2N 3N probably how it would go if left alone, assuming they play 2/1, or do they play strong @C?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|galallie:  they need to find the Queen of spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridgegoth: Nope, 4@D, 2@S 2@H 4@C|pg||

pc|s5|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|agumperz:  if 6NT makes at other table|pg||
nt|kit: Right line of play is to test diamonds first, then guess spades unless something exciting happens in diamonds.  And something exciting does happen!|pg||
nt|galallie:  thats true, well its lucky QJ of diamonds drops doubleton|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Slam really not biddable though, 19 opposite 12 with 2 balanced hands rarely gets to slam|pg||
nt|kit: Even if they get to 6@D, a much worse contract, that also makes.|pg||
nt|ctuncok:  it would have taken Zach G. holding one of those hands to bid the slam :)|pg||

nt|galallie:  no games to be made here|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Andrew Jeng is West and Richard Jeng is East|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Also, the carryover is reported wrong|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|johnjones:  Could we see a pass of 1S X here/|pg||
nt|malipivo:  as I see slams everywhere, this must be one of them|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a spade and a diamond loser is there|pg||
nt|poohbear: undo please|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Roger will probably bid 4@C|pg||
nt|galallie:  winning bid is to pass 3spades given the vulnerability. or double.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  yes, @sK is sitting nicely|pg||
nt|malipivo:  What a slam, I hope they will bid it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer on a non spade lead can strip the hand and knowing that North has at most 2@ss from the bidding can play ace and a @s to the Q and claim no  matter who has the king|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  NS missed game for +170 only, so this will be the first real blood of the match!!!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is real bridge, so a peaceful contract and fight for overtricks.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results and running scores for all three series here:|pg||
pc|h6|nt|johnjones:  True, but the layout looks friendly enough for both 4H and 3NT to work.  |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hop avoided the @c lead, so will go 1 off|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h is a fine contract for the other side, diamonds providing winners fro a club discard|pg||

nt|lukasz1982: 1@d = pewnie @h, a kontra fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West should bid the slam. singleton @c and an important @s card|pg||
nt|poohbear: and sure enuff|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It was a nice bid.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He will have a right to play it, but bidding is not over.|pg||
nt|poohbear: save is reasonable|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@d went down a lot in the other room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot two diamonds ruffs in a club contract.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|johnjones:  with the CA wrong, down 1 looks likely|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'd expect a game too many versus a game too few from the juniors.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: lub cos:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: will normally make this, but he can go wrong|pg||
nt|poohbear: more likely 2 ruffs in a @d contract|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Declarer lead trumps too early forgetting his only chance: clubs.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Personally, I dont particularly like the odds of 4@s, his 3@s bid allready showed his hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: winning 3 imps versus losing a bunch if 4@h was not making, need to be pretty sure :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The risk is that 500/800 points are there for sure, 4@h might still have a chance to get beaten.|pg||
nt|galallie:  this should be down two|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yep|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I thought it was Puppet, but then 3@D isn't right|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|uni_dennis: 4@sX -1 on bd 2, so 7 imps back to Netherlands|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, 4@sN, @hK lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If North would have three diamonds and two clubs, there is one possible ruff.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|poohbear: So lets see if Nabil can play it as well as he bid it|pg||
nt|poohbear: I say yes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|malipivo:  Board 2 is a 12-imp victory for France.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: if he decides to take a @h finesse for example|pg||
nt|frankaus: prob duck @c in presumed safe (w) hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: IF he had not do that,the contract was "make"|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Defense is accurate.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  We may spot it in spades at least (finessing @sK is on).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, 4@sXE.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  The advantage of @hJ9xx can be seen, but can be finessed.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c asked for a 5 card major and 3@d denied it|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yeah, as soon as one Jeng gets in, they'll lead a @S,  now allowing N to make 5|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  not*|pg||

nt|lukasz1982: jak juz mowilem, patrza troche krzywo|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, life might be easy when holding 5-5-3-0 distribution|pg||

pc|h3|nt|malipivo:  Or one imp for Argentina if they find some overtricks and they should and there is no spade lead.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|malipivo:  West holding 4 hcps has no use for East, but 5 spades does.|pg||
nt|poohbear: so West has denied a 4 card major cause he would have showed it and all we know about declarer is he doesnt have a 5 card major|pg||
pc|d4|nt|johnjones:  The defense appears to have 5 D and 2 S before declarer can get in|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even a low heart lead gives up a trick: @hT is above @hJ.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Or rather below.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  Our attention goes to diamonds, which is crucial on this deal.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  declarer may try to steal one club trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@C = transfer advance i expect|pg||
nt|jafa: slam makes on a non spade lead|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|minimeck: Somewhat conservative by hung with this monster|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|malipivo:  Declarer will soon finesse in hearts to avoid dangerous opponent (South).|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|malipivo:  Spades are friendly too as breaking 3-3.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1 off here as well|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense running out of gas really fast here|pg||
nt|minimeck: If 2@d promised a non-bust|pg||
pc|s8|nt|johnjones:  North has 7 stone cold tricks.  He can play for 3-3 C or the HA onside for 8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|malipivo:  Heart continuation is expected here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is getting endplayed in two suits.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  even ducking is not stopping declarer from making (double dummy)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but getting him to trouble|pg||
nt|malipivo:  operator: 6@h perhaps?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|galallie:  board three the other table was down 2|pg||
nt|galallie:  at 3spades|pg||

pc|dT|nt|lukasz1982: aj, jednak nie od lewy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|keylime:  Might be able to arrange an endplay here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even after @dT9 East is covering and securing a trick in diamond suit.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  This was a good route too|pg||
pc|h5|nt|malipivo:  if North covers, declarer has to play @dQ and discard a club|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and ruff a club|pg||
nt|malipivo:  To be able to get back to hand for last round of finesse.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  now 8@h is blocking the suit and he might be forced to do that anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  spades are no longer helping as an entry thanks to that duck|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Now making 6|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well played by N|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|keylime:  A@c, K@c, club exit. |pg||

mb|3S|mb|d|nt|bridgegoth: Hard to find after 2@S, i much prefer 3@S with a 7 bagger|pg||
nt|galallie:  I agree|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: I think I'd roll the dice on 4@S before just bidding 2@S with those cards |pg||
nt|kit: Apparently South wasn't sure that the 3@S call showed heart support.  He may have thought it was solid diamonds and looking for a stopper.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: But he know if North had the big heart support, North would go to 4@H.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 3@S as a 2 way bid is a good treatment, N can pull 3NT with @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: The ruff won't hurt him, as then the diamonds will provide a pitch for the losing club.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: A spec has suggested after X of 3@S W might should bid 4@S,|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: any thoughts on that?|pg||

mb|1D|nt|hackenbush: a good start for Australia|pg||
nt|malipivo:  What a nice slam morning we are having!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: curious bidding at the other table, where North cue-bid six diamonds, got six spades from partner and bid seven anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  good morning|pg||
nt|dburn: but it makes sense - since partner did not bid six hearts, maybe everything he had was in clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results for all three series here:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  England currently standing 3rd, Poland currently standing 4th. We are watching Youngsters.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: poprawianie Butlera odbywa siê poprzez branie zapisów na swoj¹ stronê a nie odwrotnie|pg||
nt|poohbear: Netherlands are crushing Canada thru 3 boards . Almost a max already|pg||
nt|poohbear: Israel small lead over USA2|pg||
nt|poohbear: Magic number for Israel is 374 in the standings. If they get that they cant be caught|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even 4@s looks makeable as N-S are holding all the spade spots.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@h depends on not losing 3@hs and a @s|pg||
nt|poohbear: they will play 4@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: not going to be so easy for England after North opened with an artificial bid instead of a natural one|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is not risking and passes.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 7.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If passing this, 2 imps to China.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is risky as game may be missed on some 10-11 HCPs.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: convention cards of all pairs are here: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/wbf/2012YouthTaicang/default.asp|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, preference of 5-3 over 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Not necessarily. Finding the killing lead there is tough to ask|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: not that I blame him|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We see 6 fast winners and some will be done for the 7th.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *work|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it might be interesting to see 3!n E-W losing only 4 aces|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sAJ were onside, @dJ as well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, it is a theory|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3 tens on this board were helping a lot|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and 3 nines as well|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  likely that brazil will be in 3nt on board 4, after all they do have 26hp|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: zdecydowanie tak|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Some days we will be in 4@s making, but today is not the day.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Some multi gadgetry here, european players likely to be more familiar with the followups :) |pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are losing 2 spades a diamond and maybe a club.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Some kind of pass or correct with preference to hearts i suppose|pg||
nt|minimeck: Looks like a pen x and a natural 2@c bid here|pg||
nt|minimeck: Hard to guess their methods here, west's double very likely takeout for the majors or something along those lines|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: I don't like 6 card suits in 1NT so it always pleases me when it gets punished|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse is possible in clubs, but there is not enough transportation.|pg||

nt|lukasz1982: jakimi gramy transferami :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lukasz1982: ale moze tutaj nie wystapi :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the meantime, declarer went down on Board 2 after a diamond lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n would be nice contract on this board.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  If more of West's points were in @S, 3 would have been a effective bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|keylime:  I always have a good feeling when after pard opens a 1 bid, I have possibly more points than them. There's a certain comfort that goes with it.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  running scores on http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  7@d may force N-S to 7@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West didn't buy it and didn't cover with queen.|pg||
nt|minimeck: or a game try for either major it seems |pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's hope defence will cash their club winner.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@d asks partner to bid his best major|pg||
nt|galallie:  Yes, but making and bidding a slam is usually a push or a good board|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 3@h GF 5-5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason is that hearts are providing enough winners for club discards.|pg||
nt|minimeck: will still be ok, with east only having 2h :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I see it being a push, but then again, I could be wrong|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  And often, I am wrong :)|pg||
nt|galallie:  this contract is about as icy as it gets|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well, he knows where the @C finesse will be|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Push on the slamn board|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  slam*|pg||
nt|galallie:  you were right :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  The Swedes appear to be playing that 3C would be a high level reverse and show extras.  That is a very sensible agreement.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Other table had a very lengthy, relay auction to the excellent contract of 6@d.|pg||
nt|kania12:  trzeba liczyc na pomoc|pg||
pc|d7|nt|johnjones:  He had a Precison 2C bid available - it would have worked better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  EW clearly play very constructive preempts|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: jednak raczej nie bedzie zapisu dla nas|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @hQJ provide one entry to South.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|keylime:  I agree; bidding 3@c here if you're a pattern bidder, causes problems due to the room once takes to show a club suit. I myself would rather rebid 2@h as a waiting call here then the 3@c bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it might|pg||
nt|poohbear: So this should be easy as declarer should play a @h to the 9 as his first play . The Jack pops second time so no guess|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: but they'll get some back here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with 5-4 they bid 2@C first and then Smolen (2@c-2@D//3@h as 5@S-4@h and 3@s as 5@h-4@s)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@s doesn't seem right to me. E has a good hand for slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In North had @hKx South hand would be entryless on accurate defence.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If @hK played, defense ducks.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec messages me they do play 3C as a high level reverse - thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  North's hand should be prime now, and South with four shiny bullets might take a stab at grand here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4-1 diamond break coupled with the heart position hurts the chance for grand here a bit.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A grand is excellent without a trump lead, but iffy with a trump lead|pg||
nt|keylime:  You'd need entries, which at 7 on a trump lead becomes perilous.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec tells me they choose a natural sequence, but had relays available|pg||
nt|johnjones:  If that is the case, that shows excellent judgement because it put weight on the KD|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we may count a lot of tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe it should have done|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if W had a singleton @c you only need to find @hQ|pg||
nt|sliynk: he needs to be careful not to lead @HT as then a spade can be ducked and a ruff given with @H7|pg||
nt|poohbear: you there griff?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|malipivo:  fast winner counting: 1-2 hearts, 6 diamonds and two 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he will try it anyway|pg||
pc|h4|nt|keylime:  And the T too. Both prime cards here.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|minimeck: Well sorted out by EW here, hung certainly liked his hand on the auction|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|keylime:  Nice natural auction here to a likely push. Well done.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Which might be found with relays, but sometimes relays run out of room to find all exact cards.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially with pinpointing 5-5 hands. The frequencies are not as friendly as the 5431 hands.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I like South's decision to go natural, but think he wimped a little in not bidding the grand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a fair game here, reached after the opening instead of preempt. Needs 3-2 trumps and @hA onside, or some defensive help|pg||
nt|minimeck: This lead will help simplify any entry issues on this hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|johnjones:  Good point|pg||
nt|keylime:  West has made a nice lead here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer doesn't know clubs are 3-3 and that hearts are not 5-2. So entry management will be important.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|malipivo:  Another opportunity was to steal a club winner: leading a low club from North and hoping that ace won't be played at first round.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defence is ducking from time to time to get more information/signals from partner.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If low @h played, defense wins with @hA and @hK is blocking a heart suit.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|johnjones:  He'll be happy to not lose a trump trick though.|pg||
nt|keylime:  16 board segments for the Youth Teams in the RR.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  without a D lead it will make 5|pg||
nt|kania12:  dama kier?|pg||
nt|asya13: Not good defence by east west|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|uni_dennis: 1NT overcall very agressive here with just 14hcp, no real suit and only Qxx in @h |pg||
pc|s6|nt|keylime:  Playing under Cat 3 of the WBF regs, so no Brown Stickers or HUMs (Highly Unusual Methods).|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|kit: Likely 1NT by West -- giving North an interesting problem.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: I think North should try 2@S.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bridgegoth: I'll just bid 2@S, i can stand anything partner bids|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: first real slam hand here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: OR in 6@c after strong 1@c and a 4@D overcall|pg||
nt|malipivo:  welcome|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Never seen a 9 card suit in the tournament yet|pg||
nt|galallie:  i saw one|pg||
nt|galallie:  9 diamonds to the KT|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  He knows W is probably leading a singleton|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  No harm in playing small|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|ryskiel_: znou cos/kto wisi?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is no entry in South's hand, so squeeze against East looks impossible.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Oh, yes I did, now to think of it|pg||
nt|galallie:  this should be a competetive auction|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I was watching Italy vs. France with that hand|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The French made 5@DX, while the French at the other table made 5@H|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  If they break 3-3, so be it|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Mozart's music for my ears: a slam zone!|pg||
nt|galallie:  maybe not as much if the vulnerability was reversed. since EW have a minor suit sacriface |pg||
nt|coolbeans:  3NT = Gambling with an outside stopper|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Hard call for W here|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|dburn: Poland clearly have a game plan - overcall 4@d on every hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 7@s and 7@c both very good contracts|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  What if E's suit is @C? Then a pass is correct|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  5@D will make with the @H finesse onside|pg||
mb|4S|nt|malipivo:  We shall see what level of risk they are taking.|pg||
nt|dburn: seems to be working well so far|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@C their only strong opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: treacherous 4@h here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, board 5: they are in 1!nN.|pg||
nt|poohbear: good slam here NS|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Hopefully, N/S get to 6@S. Getting to 7 missing a keycard is a terrible bid, but will also make|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  5@s might be on as double finessing in clubs is working|pg||
nt|kluk: Mam nadzieje:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 6@d will be 4 off only|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@C only contains strong hands, so pass on 5@d and now on 6@d will be forcing|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but think they haven't discussed this very much|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A slam requires one of the finesses.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  They got an overtrick there so tied after 5. This room is two boards behind now; how much time are they allocated - 8.5 min/board?|pg||
nt|galallie:  7 diamonds is down three, making it a good sac if they find 6spades. but it might also push them to 7|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome Cam Shunta, former Junior international. |pg||
nt|goon1407: Thanks Matt|pg||
pc|dA|nt|uni_dennis: would pass or DBL on 5@d show interest to play something|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: pass on 6@d shows a hand to play (dbl would be penalty, usually BAL, semi-bal)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: although pass on 6@D will show interest in bidding, i don't know if Westerbeek thinks his @s 8xxx is enough to do so|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Scoreboard shows -1, it means that operator might get lost the actual play.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Good pass by W. He knew what he was starting if he cam back in the auction|pg||
nt|galallie:  crazy they stopped at four|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I feel for Roger here. I wouldn't know what to bid after 4@S|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzjy: SRY,the network is too poor.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 8 imps for israel on bd 5 as 2@c went 3 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: .|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and if the slam goes down?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  one losing heart is going away on @dA, two more on club ruffs|pg||
nt|MolvaM: chopin's funeral march?  :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But the @hK is a problem.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|malipivo:  Possible 8-imp swing coming.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  any voters for slam?|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: tu sie chyba nic wielkiego nie dzieje - trzeba troche uwazac na komunikacje, ale jest Jx pik jak by co|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi pavel|pg||
nt|malipivo:  On this deal, @hA first and then a low towards @hQ would work, but that's double dummy play.|pg||
nt|galallie:  the 4spades bid did sort of stop the auction|pg||
nt|minimeck: A perfectly normal 3nt here, the clubs, however, simply do not run :x likely pretty flat , will shift to spades here|pg||
nt|minimeck: most likely|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  N gets away with murder here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|johnjones:  On a lucky day 4H might make an overtrick, but not today.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This would be a risky one, but we may expect to see it at some tables.|pg||
nt|galallie:  exactly|pg||
pc|hT|nt|uni_dennis: in the open room padon made a take-out dbl over 3@d lifting NS to 4@d, but that was still an easy make|pg||
nt|minimeck: this hand is certainly quite unfriendly, very well might limit declarer to 3 trumps and two aces|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  This Australian team is possible our best for many years. The culmination of some very hard work by the guys. They all have several years of international experience at U26 level.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|malipivo:  On this deal a low heart from West to @hT is working.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @s98 are useful cards as trumps might be 4-2 or even worse.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|poohbear: as well as at the top levels in Australia|pg||
nt|minimeck: however, edgtton can see that the dummy and it's clubs will be dead, so no hurry|pg||
pc|hA|nt|coolbeans:  However, 3@S may not be forcing|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  W made it hard on them, and he should be congratulated for it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|malipivo:  In this case, declarer may try to drop @hK.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|malipivo:  A diamond lead wouldn't be nice as it also kills one transport to West hand.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  meaning to play a low @h followed by a low heart|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Another sensible decision by North this time.  The H values aren't working, so he stayed off a direct raise.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So nice bids here|pg||
nt|keylime:  Their teammates going two off red in the other room, makes this important to make +140 to cover some of the loss.|pg||
nt|keylime:  In the other room, South overcalled a strong NT with a multi 2@d overcall, which drove W/E into 3NT.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The other room was down 2 in 3NT, which definately doesn't get the "sensible" award, although Multi is tough to deal with|pg||
nt|keylime:  Ten tricks are available here for South. The heart will jettison a club and the K@s is in the slot.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect that N/S in the other room maybe playing Multi-Landy or something similar.|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a transnational final|pg||
nt|poohbear: for Nabil|pg||
nt|minimeck: Risky, however, if south had a 4th diamond|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|johnjones:  For American  (ACBL) spectators, there is no written defense allowed in this competition|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Down 2 will be a push with the uppercut|pg||
pc|c2|nt|minimeck: What would you choose the west hand on this auction cam?|pg||
nt|minimeck: to lead*|pg||
nt|goon1407: I think its a really tough lead choice initially, |pg||
pc|s9|nt|malipivo:  South might bid 4@d, just to say he is having support, leading from KJT is not easy.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: East thought that West might hold a hand with long @hs and W thought/hoped that 6@h would show a good 5-card|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If slam goes down, I should congratulate opponents of setting me down.|pg||
nt|poohbear: We have 5 players in this tournament that played in the transnationals finals. West ( Edgtton ) and 4 Israelis|pg||
nt|poohbear: beat out many world famous players along the way|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  But if W found that E had @D, they may have reached their game|pg||
pc|dK|nt|MolvaM: well @hA first is a nice safety play|pg||
nt|poohbear: Israel has dropped behind the Netherlands in the all important run for first in the standings|pg||
nt|goon1407: with a snap 3nt by dwyer, I am inclined for some sort of major lead.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|keylime:  That's right, so unlike here in the US, where certain items played permit the opponents of that treatment to have written defenses, on site it is all in the brain.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lukasz1982: @cK nie utrudnil raczej wziecia 10 lew|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|keylime:  There was a hand a few years ago, if memory serves Freeman-Nickwell were defending against the Multi 2@d opening. They had 15 pages (!) of notes for the Multi they were allowed to use to get to an excellent slam.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: ale W nie musialamiec J :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, indeed it is|pg||
nt|malipivo:  here we go!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but even declarer finesses he will not go down|pg||
nt|poohbear: good news for Israel is Netherlands has no place to go but down :P|pg||
pc|sK|nt|MolvaM: since clubs are 2-2 and he can ruff 2 clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  French commentary in the other room, if it is your preference.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|goon1407: but... with N/S 1nt's frequently having a five card major, its a difficult lead choice.  |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  From our perspective it is easy to see everything.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: It helps when you have everything in writing. Pathetic|pg||
nt|keylime:  And Roland, in our mid-chart events, we can play any defense over 1NT, without any disclosed defenses.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The ACBL is ridiculous in its treatment of Multi defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Outside the US you have to remember stuff. We call bridge a mind game|pg||
pc|c5|nt|uni_dennis: but in a way strange by W. he wanted to play 6@s opposite some fit, but now E bids 6@h he believes it can only show a good suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, one more advantage for declarer.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|keylime:  Yet, xfers over natural 1 club opening demand a written defense, and that is a lot easier to cope with.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: znowu?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|h5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We shall also note that clubs breaking 2-2 is a great advantage of those two ruffs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It could be 3-1 or 4-0.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|pc|c7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
mc|8|nt|minimeck: Indeed, had he lead a spade here would have worked out the same, leading A from AKx (with the benefit of seeing the dummy to determine what's next) could really donate to the ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: declarer on some layouts|pg||
pg||

mb|p|nt|galallie:  haha :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: looks like West will be forced to raise on 3 cards here, nothing else makes sense|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kit: He could bid 1NT.  He is 4-3-3-3.  A stopper is as strong as it sounds.|pg||
nt|kit: 1NT would have shut East up.  But 2@S may encourage him to bid too much.|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|galallie:  I played a hand today where i was 4-3-3-3 with jxx in opponents suit and i didnt bid 1nt and it was the winning bid unfortunately |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|galallie:  i think jxx sounds better than Txx though|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Not sure i like 4@S with onlly 3 cards|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|galallie:  EW got carried away here|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: If I was going to accept, i'd bid 4@H, |pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s3|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Yes, endplayed into the winning like|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: Bingo! Good call Kit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kit: If South ducks the spade, declarer just plays a third spade.  he knows South is out of diamonds.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: seems logical to just play carsd from the top now and only finesse if needed|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|bridgegoth: starting with @Cs|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|galallie:  Israel gets lucky in every way here|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but they had to take advantage of their luck with the proper inference about the spade suit.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Agreed, they made their own luck in the play, now he just has to finish it off, which he should, this is the easy part|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Jeng also bid 2@S with that 7 bagger a couple hands ago, so Isreal will be making 4@H as well there|pg||
nt|kit: He is considering riding the 10 of clubs -- the only losing line|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|bridgegoth: no reason to, if N has the long @Cs, the @H will either pop or be a sure finesse|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Nice contract based on 14-13 HCPs.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: a kib warned about the 2@c opener. 1@s would have been easier|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: as you can bid your 2 suits|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Nice job!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It was a risky slam. Next board.|pg||
nt|poohbear: so both sides missed thslam and the board is flat|pg||

nt|poohbear: interesting 4@h here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dont think declarer can make unless there is a @c lead|pg||
nt|poohbear: but I dont see that happening|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer CANT make|pg||
nt|minimeck: or, my spies tell me Aussies in 3@c at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 2@d 18-19 bal, but again a 17-count|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: although this one looks like 18|pg||
nt|minimeck: The Joe grue notrump here by owen :)|pg||
nt|goon1407: Kevin was a little aggressive with 3nt, but with such a solid 6 card suit, I think its a good bid.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|johnjones:  Hey we're back!!!|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Nice defense on a tough layout - 12 more for Australia|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if W didn't bid 3@D here he would be on lead against 3NT likely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: you are watching match 16|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the round robin consists of 19 matches|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@s would go down if defence cash their @h+@c winners.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 5, they are in 4@s.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It might easily go down!|pg||
nt|poohbear: what do you guys think of Neg dbl vs 2@h by North?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  1@C = 17+|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea, the other table didn't upgrade to 1nt so they were not getting to game|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I meant 5 IMPs, forgot it went both ways|pg||
mb|1D|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 8.|pg||
mb|d|nt|uni_dennis: but NS will get to 5@c now|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h should go down as well.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for results http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I'd bid 2H.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I like it too as long as I can get out in 2NT|pg||
nt|galallie:  4diamonds? but that would show support in hearts, and an X while it re opens the bidding does nothing to describe his hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: This 1nt here is likely to get NS way overbid , unless north is planning on doubling 2@h for pen|pg||
nt|asya13: nice of east to pull|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The score is now 14-13 USA 1. The carryover is for Israel|pg||
nt|asya13: west*|pg||
mb|2D|nt|malipivo:  Poland has crossed 42-imp difference, so at the moment it is 25-4 VP.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so after tomorrow evening, the first 8 ranked teams will proceed to the quarter finals|pg||
nt|goon1407: I think Dwyer was trapping|pg||
nt|minimeck: I agree, it is unsure their methods over the 2@d 1 major|pg||
mb|2H|nt|malipivo:  We are enjoying momentum of seeing scores from the other table.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and that's an interesting contract|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Yes.  A better method might be to play 2C to show a (possibly weaker) heart hand and 2H to show a good hand with clubs.|pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps double should be cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  But the battle is not over.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: rdbl is?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would not like to be in 3!n E-W.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I like that. |pg||
nt|poohbear: As long as I dont have to remember it :P|pg||

nt|galallie:  another slam hand, with some luck|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Roger's in the tank debating between 4@S and looking for 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  It is touch work.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: DBL take-out|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NS escaped the DBL in the open room as W rebid 2@c, so 3NT EW there|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@c is a safe contract.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *tough|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like declarer needs to finesse for @sKQ inside|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I haven't check all the CCs, but I know where they are.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which actually works|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The cool thing about Precision is that plenty of bidding room is left for slam investigation|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  However, N needs the right 8-10 HCP to make this slam|pg||
nt|goon1407: Another tough hand to lead from|pg||
nt|minimeck: A good point also by specs, north likely percieves west to have spades and was planning on making a takeout x|pg||
nt|minimeck: after the pass/correct|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hackenbush: cards are right for trump elopement|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: declarer might play W to have @sQ for his overcall|pg||
nt|minimeck: A reasonable lead here, don't think he was ever considering a heart|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The @S game requires a lot of cards to be in the right place. The other table got there though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|malipivo:  Poland youngesters were having great first half yesterday, but losing slightly the second.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but the problem are hearts itself|pg||
nt|poohbear: Looks like East took West's dbl of 2@s as takeout|pg||
nt|poohbear: In that case West is SUPER aggressive|pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile the other table's EW is also playing 3nt, doubled... usually not good when both tables are playing the same contract|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I mean vice versa.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, England may start the long road back here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, take @dK with an ace and finesse everything against North|pg||
nt|poohbear: oops|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Uh oh|pg||
nt|malipivo:  :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and :( I am fair to both teams.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|kluk: I beda plusy!|pg||
nt|galallie:  understanable sign off at 4|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at the moment italy is 7th and singapore is 9th ranked|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but counting points he may place all hcp's with south|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he is afraid that the @h finesse is not on as well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, indeed, so the endgame will be interesting|pg||
pc|s5|nt|malipivo:  As defence can attack only one suit, risky 3!n was on.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so this is one of the critical matches|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but there are 3 more matches (16 boards each) tomorrow|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is making this contract and another push.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|gruffydd:  Noble of you.  I guess at this stage I am too --- although only because for the Aussies the result of this match is likely to only make the difference between 2nd and 3rd|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but it would be down.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now cant stop south from gaining the lead in spades|pg||
pc|h4|nt|uni_dennis: E showing neutral with his 2nd @d, another indication about @sQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so will go down|pg||
pc|h9|nt|malipivo:  declarer is avoiding hearts|pg||
nt|malipivo:  this may cost the contract|pg||
pc|h5|nt|galallie:  6 requires the 3-3 club break|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  3-3 Spade break, 3-3 Club break, and Spades to be positioned correctly|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|galallie:  beat me to it :P|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Depending on what i'm playing over 1NT, |pg||

mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Does he have a way to show 1 suited @Ds easily?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  playing the whatchamacallit convention, you can double to show a 5+m and a 4M|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure he could bid 3@D naturally if nothing else.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  oh yes, the Woolsey convention:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: Maybe he decided that he was likely outgunned, so chose not to reveal his distribution.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|agumperz:  since he didnt have the spades and his pard was a PH|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|pc|dK|pg||

nt|agumperz:  he did rate to lose the auction|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: needs the @H shift now|pg||
nt|kit: But the 2 of diamonds?????|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Are they playing reverse SP?|pg||
nt|galallie:  Oops|pg||
nt|kit: Guess not.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: If they were, someone forgot, otherwise, a signalling error there, and a costly one|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: now all roads lead to success|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: It is really a club 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: I think the signal was wrong|pg||
nt|kit: I dont' know what went wrong there -- looking at that dummy signalling for a heart was super-obvious, so either he blundered with the 2 of diamonds or his partner blundered with ...|pg||
nt|kit: the methods|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Hello operator, is there any way you can fix the score? It should be 13-0 Isreal|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 13-9 sorry|pg||
nt|kit: I'm told normal suit-preference.  So 2 of diamonds was just a bad play.|pg||
nt|galallie:  it is normal|pg||
nt|galallie:  Important not to be sloppy with carding|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: yes, if normal suit pref, that just a poor play,|pg||
nt|galallie:  Zach usually is very careful about these things|pg||
nt|galallie:  everyone is mortal though|pg||
nt|kit: Kaplan convinced his partner has king of clubs, and that he is getting a second ruff.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  its a shame after such a nice lead|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I think low was slightly better, in case N underlead Axx, but then again, South isn't likely passing a 6/5|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: Yes, 1 result no matter how good or bad won't make or break a session, but this is still one you feel really bad about beacuse it was easily preventable|pg||
nt|kit: It was a great opening lead -- I think the hand would make after other leads, although declarer might run a trick short.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  it is pity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East would be forced to play heart and it could be guessed in declarer's favor.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @s discard by E doesn't say that much, declarer's hand was clear already|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, you are right|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 13 hcp are out and south may well have them all|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is an opportunity for the other table.|pg||
nt|poohbear: so 12 to Italy in a seesaw match so far|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have got a new leader in this match.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Another push|pg||
nt|galallie:  if they were off the Aq, he'd have a guess to make|pg||
nt|goon1407: as much as I like the shape, being 6-4 wtih KJ KJ is asking to go -500+|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: If W opens they are likely to end up in a game|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This looks like partscore battle.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As I see slams everywhere, this is not the case for N-S (2 aces off).|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 5@C only 2 down, but S will never support|pg||
mb|1N|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing 3@hE.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Fast loser count: we are losing a spade, a heart and a diamond.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: light opening by west|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would east try to penalize 2@h?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|malipivo:  Second diamond loser can be discarded via ruffing or via developed clubs.|pg||
nt|galallie:  50-50 where the ace could be|pg||
mb|2H|nt|keylime:  Only about 1.5% give or take has made Diamond LM in the ACBL. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: W has revoked club 6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this a more routine 4@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: Singapore has snuck into the last qualifying spot edging out Denmark|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The US had a chance to pull this match within 5|pg||
nt|minimeck: They are having a good vigorous discussion about it at the other table :) both players bid their hands very strongly|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  2@C = single-suited|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  E-W are having their chance in spades.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@C puts a lot more pressure on than 3@c, but E has a simple 4@h with his flat hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and now S hopes they did wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like they will reach a thin 3nt|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theory a spade loser might get away on club winners if spades aren't attack first.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Club ruffing is not going to work for defence as South is also singleton in clubs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am mistaken here, thank you for spotting this from spec:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  you can only make 3 discards, not enough... from 5:)|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Does that make them first pick off the menu?|pg||
nt|poohbear: running scores. Top 8 qualify    http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|galallie:  do you know what determined the carryovers?|pg||
nt|goon1407: 6@d makes here|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is a long match, the key for the US is to try to continue to play strong & steady, if you try and hit a homerun every pitch, you're likely to strike out|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|frankaus: this looks to be a make|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this lead makes it interesting|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: defense can now set up a @s before @ds are good, but might just lose 1@s 1@h 1@d|pg||
nt|malipivo:  that's very true, a @c7 is not a winner|pg||
nt|poohbear: depends on whethe rthere is carryover and who gets in|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Carry over = half of head-to-head result from the round robin, capped at some amount or other? Have I remembered correctly?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I think it may have been how the teams did against each other in the round robin|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I originally thought it was seeding, but that doesn't look right|pg||
nt|minimeck: Any pair who bids 6@d on these cards deserves a thorough mental examination :)|pg||
nt|goon1407: its cold. if you know about the 9 card diamond fit and the 8@c club fit... I could be sold|pg||
nt|goon1407: I think its unattainable after Owen's 4@h bid, however.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|asya13: 4sp should be the contract e-w will be in|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  1NT instead of 2S is interesting|pg||
nt|dburn: sensible contract, as is 1@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobry ranek wiernym polskim kibicom|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even 3!n would work well on this board.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|johnjones:  Another push board.  We are watching a low scoring but well played match.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Possibly influenced by their limit opening |pg||
nt|malipivo:  N-S are risking being in 4@s.|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes. If you finished higher in the round robin. Otherwise its 1/3 of the cap|pg||
nt|poohbear: I belief the cap is 48 imps|pg||
nt|poohbear: at least thats the Bermuda Bowl rules|pg||
nt|poohbear: in the meantime NS have a shaky 3NT here|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Nabil is in the tank well and good|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@dX looked down two.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hard to pass 3@ds dbled when partner makes a takeout dbl and you have a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: down 4 on a low @D lead, played from france in youngsters|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think 3NT is a reasonable shot. |pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Nabil is thinking about what to switch to. Any of the three other suits might be right.|pg||
nt|poohbear: unfortunate for Zanasi that partner dbled purely in majors|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, oh yes, I am not blaming him with his next bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: EW play precision|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: now it gets interesting with 4@s, 2@h and 2@d tricks already|pg||

nt|malipivo:  And it just happened, 4@s-1 on Board 5.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Now that S knows that W has @D, he easily find the lead of the A|pg||
pc|dA|nt|uni_dennis: can make if he plays on @hs first, then can finesse @h10 and pitch his @C on @Ds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|poohbear: not sure what Edgtton has against his QJ10xxx suit :)|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Possibly Nabil decided that the 2H *might* have been suit-preference, and absent any other indication he went with that.|pg||
nt|poohbear: but now he has an opportunity to switch to his 3rd non suit |pg||
nt|gruffydd:  His suit is a safe switch ... but he has no entries so he'll never enjoy it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 might have been forced play|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  It can go down if N switches to a @H after getting the ruff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ryskiel_: nieco pechowo zaczêlimy ten mecz z £otw¹|pg||

pc|c2|nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 7, N-S are bidding aggresively and buying 3!n.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It was due to @sT.|pg||

nt|keylime:  The bridge on VuGraph has been outstanding lately. The Spingold was gripping, and the Youth Teams already looks great.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  sneaky|pg||
nt|johnjones:  he may have wanted to set the Cs up for tricks though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the other room Padon responded 1@s, then supported @c before bidding 3NT, so @d6 lead there|pg||
nt|z_lasu: tu raczej nie da sie wygrac|pg||
nt|galallie:  it was determined by how they did against one another in the RR match|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Rajkumar should switch to the 10 of @C, and put a hard decision on E|pg||
nt|galallie:  Australia had beat the US 25-3|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  On IMPs or VPs?|pg||
nt|galallie:  Vps|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Then I am not entirely sure what determines the carryover. To me, it's just random numbers :)|pg||
nt|galallie:  IMPs was 9-64 |pg||
pc|d2|nt|poohbear: now a @d shift|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  5C clearly looked discouraging enough!! not sure why Andy (Hung) couldn't play the 7C instead of the 5C|pg||
nt|poohbear: and the defense will have played all 4 suits in the first 4 tricks in 3BT . Rarely see that :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gruffydd:  yes ... all 4 suits played by defense.  Not normally a good tactic|pg||

pc|c4|nt|johnjones:  He'll be OK since the HK is a reentry |pg||
nt|malipivo:  It may lead to an ovetrick in OR and an imp to England.|pg||

nt|poohbear: I read that yesterday :) very funny|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  East (Hung) is one of the editors|pg||

nt|malipivo:  So swing is coming as they shall make it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: SO the board 7 has translated +1|pg||
pc|h8|nt|malipivo:  And a diamond means a lot of trouble for declarer.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: not happening in this match so far|pg||
pc|hA|nt|malipivo:  He would save a heart loser but losing trump control.|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But likely a push board.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: On a low heart lead 6@C can actually make on the lie of the cards if he lets it ride -- which he just might.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kit: 4@D might be RKC for clubs?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  if so, then 4@S is showing one KC|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kit: and now 4NT for the queen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: i would think 4NT would be to play, but i dont know their methods|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Rather lucky to stop.  No way East will find a diamond lead, so 4 diamonds will go on the spades and 5@C will make.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: @D seem more attractive than anything,|pg||
nt|kit: with North having shown 5 diamonds?  No way.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  if this was a KC auction, they would do better to switch to 1430 responses. would have allowed a 4@S queen ask and a 4NT signoff|pg||
nt|kit: this time it turns out that way, yes.  But you are more likely to want to sign off at 4NT when partner has zero aces, and then 1430 is bad since you can't do both.|pg||
nt|kit: 1430 is of value only when the RKC call is higher than 4T+1.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Actually if playing minorwood rather than kickback over minors, you save a very useful space, which is one reason i prefer kickback only over @Hs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: True, but much more often you just want partner to be the RKC bidder, so you need 4 of the minor as natural.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  even playing minorwood, they didnt have room to use it here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will go up ace, try the clubs, and when they don't split he will play spades and pray -- and his prayers will be answerd when West has exactly 4 spades.|pg||

nt|galallie:  Id do 1C|pg||
nt|asya13: 3nt is a good contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3@d is 10-11 with 3@s or7-11 with 4@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East-South are having a nice slam.|pg||
nt|dburn: but now poor West has been dealt a hand with which he would pass throughtout on any auction|pg||

nt|MolvaM: careless play from declarer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Maybe it went to @dA and spades back (trick 2 and 3).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: france youngster will probably make that one for a gain of 10 imps|pg||
nt|poohbear: South's @ss look like a fit all by themselves :)|pg||
nt|asya13: heh|pg||
mb|1N|nt|malipivo:  Neither the Czech Republic nor Slovakia teams are presented at this tournament, so I am crossing my fingers to all the teams. :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but we must recognize Caillliau's creative @cK lead|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Oh wait, it can't with Precision ;)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  1@D is their only choice|pg||
nt|galallie:  Yes, i am a 2/1 player|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, so would North, except he has to bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|johnjones:  We have a football score.  6-3 one field goal to two field goals.|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: pisze pani do redakcji - sz. redakcjo przed turniejem partner uczy³ mnie odblokowania|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The summary of the first half: 20-imp difference, 20-10 VPs in favor of France.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|johnjones:  A quick down 1|pg||
nt|dburn: here, you would like it if North had a real negative available|pg||
nt|malipivo:  23-7 VPs in favor of China|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and still living opportunity for a swing on this deal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West could bid hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  That's exactly what East needs from him.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Reopening is kind of risky with useless @sQ and 1=4=4=4 distribution.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now East thinks that partner isn't having 4 hearts, it is dangerous thought.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: hi|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to prawda, ale nale¿y æwiczyæ odruchy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: trouble|pg||
nt|poohbear: A relay auction here|pg||
nt|goon1407: easy lead hear for hung|pg||
nt|minimeck: Might need to divine the diamond suit here to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Dbl showed 4+@s and 1@s showed 2-3 @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In a balanced 11-13?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS opens all bal hand 12-14/18-19 with 1@c and then play trf and relays after that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke is usually North and Ida South, right Johan?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This sequence will probably ends in 3@d or 3@h.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NS do not play a strong @c system, so they also start with a strong 2@c (22+)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@D is waiting|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room in 4@h, but I am afraid it is going down.|pg||
nt|dburn: but 4@c is... well, it is not clear that it is even a cue bid|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is just happy he is having strong hand, who wouldn't be? |pg||
nt|dburn: and even if it is, Huber should not be looking at a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 5@d doomed on a @s lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3-imp difference, 16-14 in favor of Argentina|pg||
nt|malipivo:  On of the players must be bid aggressively to get there.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@h was 2-way: either NAT or a NT range, 2@S asked|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@D shows 6+@h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: without a 2nd suit|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I believe 2C is 3-way.  Either Natural GF, Bal GF or an invitational raise in spades.|pg||
nt|galallie:  East heavily upgraded his hand because of the diamond void|pg||
nt|minimeck: See only 6 tricks otherwise |pg||
pc|d2|nt|malipivo:  aj aj|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: widzê, ¿e wymieniali komputer... jak inni parowozy...|pg||
nt|tez: you can make 6@d but 3 nt imposible|pg||
nt|malipivo:  (with 3 more comparison from the other room)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: france has 3 good boards 7, 8, and 9|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n is nicely placed.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6,7,8 sorry|pg||
nt|goon1407: I think the play in spades is safer|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gronkvist:  studying 17 and 19 y brother and sister ;)|pg||
nt|dburn: if he wants to raise to 4@h no one would crime him, but 4@c shows clubs, not hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and Illingworth has raised those "clubs", as well he should|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East in Open Room leads @sK.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am told there is no slam.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, very true you are, i wrote that too early|pg||
pc|dA|nt|malipivo:  None players are breathing right now.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even me.|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  The rest I'm not privy too.  We can assume they've found their H fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont think inv in @ss likely since that would make the 2@s bid strange|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I don't know if worth that much of an upgrade vulnerable|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: other room 1@d pass 4@h !! by van Lankveld, all pass|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: is this correct?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Leads for N/S are 3/5 vs. suitsa|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  suits*|pg||
nt|minimeck: well sure, he has 2 spade tricks, 2 hearts, a club and the ace of diamonds, will need to make a 2nd diamond|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|malipivo:  And a swing for Costa Rica.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I will rather eat my hat if he plays low.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: w schoolsach 31:20 dla naszych zawodnikow|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: maybe S forgot the system|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: South PASSED|pg||
nt|tez: hýmm|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now we know that Zanasi likes to bid |pg||
nt|MolvaM: still there are only 8 tricks so far|pg||
nt|malipivo:  E-W preserve a diamond attack.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe declarer shld try to steal a heart trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: by playing @hJ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if he wins he can duck a club then|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or he will immediately duck the club and rely on the @s finesse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which doesnt work|pg||
nt|ritong: une entame bien raisonnée, a mon avis|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: East in Closed Room may be of the same mind|pg||
nt|minimeck: Not the worst slam in the world, trumps 3-0 sinks the boat, NS here likely playing limited openings, so south simply bid 4@s with no slam interest opposite an 11-15, many pairs ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: might use jacoby or simmilar and get to 6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason might be that 3 diamonds cannot be ruffed as spades are 3-0.|pg||
nt|goon1407: simply because if Hung has A@s and anything else, he might have opened. |pg||
pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  3 imps for Poland waveing.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: @hQ is not so good|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south grabs that immediately|pg||
nt|galallie:  East likes his diamond void a lot more when the opps start bidding them|pg||

nt|asya13: North south has the rest of the tricks now|pg||

nt|MolvaM: hmmm defensive error|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: this was a pick-up for the Australian U21s as the Chinese player sitting east lead a @c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  After an attempto to ruff club (@cA), West is getting his heart ruff.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he will, he is a nice guy :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Developing hearts is not that easy as seems.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is going to be endplayed.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: N was bidding as in their notes, now trying Exclusion for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: maybe 5d means ASK except d,and south forgot the system|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they blocked the hearts|pg||
nt|minimeck: Several pairs allready have arrived to six, one wonderful aspect of the running scores, can see each board across the field :) |pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzjy: sry,I have taken a mistake.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They were aware that hcps probably lay one-sided (1@d bid).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would be interesting to see if south was awake enough to grab the @hJ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They are after lunch, he might easily be! :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Indeed, once he spots the q of spades, should certainly guess it|pg||

nt|poohbear: I think the Italians outbid the Aussies here. 3NT looks like a better spot. But breaks are normal so 4@h should make too|pg||
nt|galallie:  his bid was still aggressive though|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|malipivo:  good day, welcome!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now bernard waits patiently again to get his @sK|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  the 98 of clubs make this hand very easy. Making 10 tricks for a flat board.  But there is the question of the best way to play hearts to guard against a 4-1 break|pg||
nt|minimeck: now can set up the long spade also, +90 it is it seems|pg||
nt|ritong: et il doit y avoir une raison  surement une courte a @s|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yes, good to set up @D because of the bad Club break|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|c7|nt|malipivo:  but he might try to endplay East for -2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Overtaking?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defense is cooperating, even low and a spade return works for time being.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Or overtaking and a spade return with overruffing potential.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *diamond return|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But club return is also a nice option. :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rêka 4-4-4-1 jest zawsze nieprzyjemna jak rozgrywa przeciwnik|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|poohbear: straight guess I think|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kit: How many spades will North bid (assuming 1@S overcall)?  3 I think.|pg||
mb|3S|an|weak|nt|kit: East will certainly do something, probably double|pg||
nt|agumperz:  he does not have enough shape for 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: And West will not be happy|pg||
mb|d|nt|agumperz:  double with a spade void is a little dicey|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: West might leave this in hoping the Law is on his side|pg||
nt|agumperz:  because partner might make an ill judged pass|pg||
nt|kit: what else can he sensibly do?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i understand|pg||
nt|kit: As it happens 4@H makes, and they might stumble into it.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|galallie:  try 4 hearts?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: wow -- that isn't exactly stumbling.  |pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I don't mind the double... i'm certainly not hurting if partner passes, I have what looks like 3 tricks, and i know spades are splitting badly for them|pg||
nt|galallie:  West probably figured theyd be in a 7 card fit anyway, and in hearts they might be in an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|kit: Funny, that what I would be thinking about clubs -- at least a 7-card fit, maybe 8.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|kit: A little imagination on the opening lead.  Makes sense actually.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|galallie:  true for either of the minors. but hearts is more points|pg||
nt|agumperz:  look at the actual hand. You are beating it one trick only because of the 3-3 club split. They could just as easily be 4-2 in the NS hands and 3@S makes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: another way to end up in 2@S|pg||
nt|asya13: Weak 3sp bid here|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  any voters for 3!n N-S?|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: slammish hand but beware of the diamonds |pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 6, they were in 6@c, making now.|pg||
nt|galallie:  I would see why some people would opt to stay safe and play in diamonds, especially in imps|pg||
nt|galallie:  this board has no prayer|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  W is happy defending this :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  This was just bad luck|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  All the bids are reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: surprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: need to hook the @h10 here to make|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and going to 4@h?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: defense can make 1@c, 2@h, 1@D, 1@s and a @c ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: for 1 down|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so good lead|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  There's a swing in the bidding here. Edgtton (and Hung) partnership style doesn't rate the west hand as a 2NT overcall (lowest two unbid suits, 5/5).|pg||
nt|sliynk: the word from the people here is if standings stay as they are it will be most likely NED v SING - France v China - Isreal v Italy - AUS v USA with AUS and Isreal in the same half ...|pg||
nt|sliynk: of the draw (that was what people were saying before this last match)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  2@d is min w @c and  not @s as a side suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: or pick the doubton @HA|pg||

nt|Walddk2: These pics really need to be updated|pg||
nt|mrdct: which seems anti-percentage at first glance|pg||
nt|johnjones:  1Nt here is 14 - 16|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but if south switches to a @s the def has 1@h, 3@s and 1@c|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale wykorzystanie tego przez Terszaka - wielka rzecz|pg||
nt|galallie:  i like a t/o double by south|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  With 6 of a Major?!|pg||
nt|galallie:  not good spots in spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: what would you bid?|pg||
nt|asya13: yeah he is stuck!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gronkvist:  yes indeed :)|pg||
nt|keylime:  6@c here is a nice contract|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2624 this is better :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Much|pg||
nt|keylime:  Can North in the relays ask for controls?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the mirrored cards in @s are horrible for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South might not do all that much battling|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@h is on|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Running scores for all teams:|pg||
pc|h3|nt|malipivo:  We see fast four losers (@s, @h! 2x@c).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south opens spades but no wasted points there against the singleton|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's test if West is not sleeping? a low diamond to @d9, but it is easy for West to cover @d6.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I know it's a tough bid for him, but he does not hold defensive cards|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cicus: I don' think so|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ca³a opowiastka jest cytatem, ¿eby mi nikt seksizmu nie zarzuci³|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  West overcalled 2NT at the other table which led to 4CXE-1|pg||
nt|poohbear: Well denmark now in 8th|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lukasz1982: ech:)|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: 8 lew i teoretycznie znikad pomocy, ale kto wie co bedzie jak sie te 8 lew sciagnie|pg||
nt|tez: @s lead down 1 |pg||
nt|MolvaM: not too many hcp's though|pg||
nt|poohbear: so nothing is clear|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Eh, give me one less @S and I agree|pg||
nt|galallie:  with KJTxxx i wouldnt ever consider a t/o double|pg||
nt|galallie:  i think the 3spades and an X in south position is reasonable. but i think im the minority|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: but South might well have led a trump, not a spade|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse in spades is being slowly developed.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: jakiej byscie szukali szansy?|pg||
nt|tez: cash AK @C:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can make it if he tests diamonds first|pg||
pc|s4|nt|uni_dennis: was interesting what to do as south|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so 4@h shld be ok|pg||
nt|poohbear: also Israel isnt leading the RR anymore|pg||
nt|minimeck: Good time for a refreshments break, this looks pretty flat |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2 spades and 2 diamonds W can lead a 3rd spade|pg||
nt|malipivo:  closely|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Very well stopped.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: interesting lead|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Now the advantage of having hidden his club suit comes into play ...  Edgtton lets loose with his SECRET WEAPON|pg||

nt|poohbear: this 3NT wont fetch|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am definitely not a fan of the 2NT bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|malipivo:  @hA is well placed, too well.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes and overruffed|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If there is qtournid=919, it stands for Juniors, 920 is a code for Youngsters and 921 is a code for Girls.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|keylime:  Other table did not sniff at the club slam here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ida is also in the Sweden ladies team at the World Mind Sports Games in France in two weeks with Cecilia Rimstedt as her partner|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it needs some bravery (experience?) to take @hA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but will go down if tries a club finesse|pg||
nt|tez: right|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@s seems better|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes they can|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 17 years young, quite an achievement|pg||
nt|mrdct: making now for sure i think|pg||
nt|hackenbush: uh-oh, the flying ace|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5 back|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't think that was the right play - andy was think he needed to get partner's @s honour set up before it runs away|pg||
nt|ianmcc: low from 3 small the trouble|pg||
nt|kluk: Zeby tylko nie za aktywnie!|pg||
nt|poohbear: At the other table they bid 4@h with West|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h9|nt|kania12:  robi sie nerwowo|pg||
nt|minimeck: draw trump and claim, next :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theory, I am in slam again, going down.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok this one more normal|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I would probably also go with 4@H with the honor doubleton|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|johnjones:  6C makes on the actual layout, but declarer would find a trump lead nasty.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: now hop will make this|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: bd 9 4@h -1, so another push|pg||
nt|malipivo:  even now|pg||
nt|kluk: Ake jak wezmie na krola, to sie zorientuje, ze jest gotowe 9 lew wiec chyba zmieni na karo|pg||
nt|malipivo:  How would you like to be in 6@h contract?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I like that. Partner is a heavy favorite to have 6 @H or a monster hand to force u to bid at 4 levelwhen you couldnt bid at 1 level|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct: NS lead 3rd from even and low from odd|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  W didn't double just in case they could run somewhere|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Go with the known fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: right|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|MolvaM: looks to be on the right track|pg||
nt|minimeck: lol! pavel I hope you would use keycard and find you are missing 1 and the queen of trump|pg||
nt|malipivo:  To be in heart slam is a bad idea missing @hAQ.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|keylime:  Very good bidding. Now, will another trump lead come from West?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  (I was thinking 6@d at first glance.)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would have been happy if I reached that but unless both reds divide 3-2 I would be in trouble|pg||
nt|MolvaM: esp after a club lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Declarer can now afford to duck a spade for communication.  That wouldn't have been possible on  a trump lead.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer will need to be in the moment here and play carefully for the slam. It's easy to let excitement as a well bid hand get to best of you.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  This will be the first swing in the match that doesn't involve undertricks or overtricks|pg||
nt|ianmcc: reprieve|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am sorry, we are in 2@s.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kania12:  brawo|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: przemyslane!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  The other table is frozen.|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer has played himself into down 2 as well|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: teraz dama na jedyna szanse i -2|pg||
nt|poohbear: should have kept another @d|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hackenbush: declarer just has enough time to stay ahead of the tap|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|hackenbush: declarer may have been playing South for 5 spades|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both suits 3-2 means > slam is about 47%|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @hT provides an entry if needed.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so not good odds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well after 3 rounds of hearts you run out of trumps|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and after ruffing the diamonds good, you cant reach dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|galallie:  smart move-- a good general rule is if you cant double another contract by the opps, dont double the one they are currently in |pg||
pc|dK|nt|tez: wd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if you play diamonds befor, you go down immediately with the diamond ruff|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: this might not be best|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other table bought 1@sN.|pg||
nt|gulczynek: Zosta³o nam jeszcze 7 rozdañ. Ju¿ sprawdzilimy, ¿e nawet 6 wystarczy, ¿eby uzbieraæ 42 impy na taryfê.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Roger can't ruff there because he's dead if E has the A of @H, which is most likely the case |pg||
pc|d7|nt|hackenbush: 3 trumps = 3 control units, in Rodwell's terms, while 3 spades need to be knocked out. And declarer has the lead, so he will come out ahead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 9, OR is playing 6@sN.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lukasz1982: moze nie na jedyna :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c4|nt|gronkvist:  but not so easy to play this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade now is best|pg||
nt|keylime:  A spec has told me this pair is the only one of both the jrs and youngsters to bid the slam. It deserves a good fate.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A spade should played first |pg||
nt|dburn: if North had stuck in the queen of hearts...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so france did well to stop at 4@h|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now will make +2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ryskiel_: Gulczyn wiesz o tym, ¿e jak pies pogryzie cz³owieka to nie jest news...dopiero jest news jak jest odwrotnie:)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: If a trump switch comes she needs the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She could also have cashed @DK and thrown her spade on @DJ|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|malipivo:  forcing them to 3@d would have benefits now|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|johnjones:  Are the girls playing the same hands as the juniors and youngsters?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||

nt|tez: 1@h pass 4@h or?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 7: North tried his best according to known information.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right. it helped when south passed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: actually I would also open that south hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on board 7|pg||
nt|poohbear: Israel has 4 boards to pick up about 16 imps to win the RR|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  He can count the points for the preempt|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer drew an extra trump and that ended her chance to get lucky in @cs if they were bloed|pg||
nt|poohbear: blocked|pg||
nt|asya13: Partner will probably end up correcting to 4hearts|pg||
nt|poohbear: So a new match !|pg||
mb|1C|nt|uni_dennis: bd 10 also @h lead in the open room|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: v Lankveld also played the 9, so will be another push|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: what will west open? i think 2@s, but some would open 4@s or 3@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Precisely defended, well done!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: a rather easy 3NT now with @d 2-2|pg||
nt|minimeck: On a closer look, 6@s is certainly makable, might need the heart lead to give it problems|pg||

pc|s9|nt|mrdct: 2@s is natural 8-11 with 5-6 @s|pg||

nt|tez: 2nt invitational @h|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: nie- grano 3 bez jednej|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@c a transfer to 2@D, to play there or any INV|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so wackwitz needs to do more than 2@D if he doesn't want to play there|pg||
nt|minimeck: the pre-empter would typically take one bid unless he has a suprise, which here he does, as 3nt looks a likely make won't be too bad here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Second team then picks from the remaining 3 teams and so on|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: hi konstatinos|pg||
nt|cicus: W has a nice hand for @Hs so he has to do something other than lazily raising to 4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have some options on this deal: finessing @cK or squeezing South in minor suits.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@h will probably make but declarer will have to work hard|pg||

nt|poohbear: There will be straight KOs starting at the round of 8|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2NT is an overbid, 1 is enough|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: z takimi pikami sie dalismy przelicytowac, no ladnie :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: * i guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after a club lead|pg||
nt|jlall: I would guess that 2@C forced 2@D (that is how they get out in 2@D), and the following 2@S bid shows an invite with 5 spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2@h is simply 4+ hearts promising 5@s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|johnjones:  Good lead, best declarer can do is -150|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Andy has embarrassment of riches|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sJxx is providing a safety trick for declarer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  An opportunity for Chinese team.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other leads are more friendly to declarer|pg||
nt|sliynk: 4 x 14 boards|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well, S is definitely not accpeting any invites|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  But I think N was way too conservative here|pg||
nt|minimeck: dwyer might have simply corrected back to 2@s, but dug his hole a bit deeper|pg||
nt|asya13: what a knowledgable table|pg||
pc|h4|nt|uni_dennis: westerbeek looking for his best bid: 3@h can be 5, 3@s can be 3, 3N needs better stopper|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good start for the def|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He may try to cash @hA first.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: france, as expected, gets 10 more from board 8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As a part of safety plan.|pg||
nt|goon1407: hard to correct back to 5-1 suit, but sometimes you have too|pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime:  Very good lead. Declarer does not have that friendly of splits here, and cards are not well placed either.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  3NT is also an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sort of auctions there's not a lot of point leading @s as partner didn't raise and RHO surely has a robust stopper|pg||

nt|malipivo:  They have crossed 42-imp difference barried and we are getting to 25-5 VPs zone.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *barrier|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|keylime:  Probably a result of the slam; the need to bid a close game to get imps back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3rd and 5th leads, also against notrump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: n  missing, my fault  Konstantinos|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: ranges in natural bidding made this a tough hand to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in strong @c after 1@c E has a GF hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think 3C was better than 3d|pg||
nt|galallie:  I agree. his single K of hearts because more valuable when his partner opens 1heart|pg||
nt|jlall: game is really bad, i think north did fine given that lee will open 5332 10 counts, south could even have a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|minimeck: this lead looks a bit favorable, but east will just have to switch to a trump when in with the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|asya13: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: So Micke knows partner has 5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And that squeeze can be blocked leading diamonds.|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder if E knows about @SK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|uni_dennis: will lose 3@c and 3@s, so 2 off|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: meyuchas passed with this West hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  hm, that's pity|pg||
nt|cicus: apparently not, else he'd have alreay bid 7|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we can see that even 7!n is on, but we are taking an advantage of seeing all hands|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results and running scores for all three series here:|pg||
nt|cicus: E can count 13 tricks if he knows about @SK, @HAK and @DA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  All three series are playing the same boards, we may compare their results afterwards easily.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe a prob if hearts 3-0 but no need to be too paranoid|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Does anyone know what the Aussies were penalised VPs for? Probably slow play.  This year was the first time ever in our Junior Team Selection we had to threaten them with VP fines for slow play.  An indication of how serious they are taking|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats only good if there is no slam :P|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  the whole affair|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Bye all have to go|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, it is pity|pg||
nt|MolvaM: what to discard?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cicus: if 5@D showed 3 aces then 5NT was an invitation to grand and @SK should suffice|pg||
pc|c5|nt|malipivo:  All cards sit well for him.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cicus: to accept|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and free finesse, but nice singleton lead|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: trzeciego trefla jak przebije 9-k¹ to faktycznie mo¿e byæ spora progresja|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence might go astray here if south plays north for a stiff @SJ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Here we can see an interesting point: another heart to ruff and repeated finesse in trumps.|pg||
nt|poohbear: standings  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  Sadly, my Hebrew is not that great, even though I'm Jewish. It's all Greek to me :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Thx Johan|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer is going to get squeezed here possibly.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I dislike the both the 2NT and 3NT bids.  Why accept with 12 scattered HCP?  Especially NV!!!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cA|nt|keylime:  I can understand if red. |pg||
nt|keylime:  but at equal white, makes no sense.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Thanks Johan!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner can't bid over 1NT, you have not missed a game|pg||
nt|mrdct: as nabil might settle for 2 off|pg||

nt|jlall: i think if your system will routinely get you to game with unremarkable 23 HCP that would not be good|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i actually don't know the difference between 3@c or 3@D by W, but i think 3@c sound stronger|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  That's true of 2@C forces 2@D|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  if*|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  A decent push, considering that 1NT is down on double dummy defense|pg||
pc|d6|nt|MolvaM: getting critical|pg||
nt|poohbear: BTW I like 2@c over 1NT. It puts partner in a much better position to compete if they enter|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mrdct: andy may have done better to play a @s through before cashing out the @d suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: but it's a lot easier looking a 4 hands|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The cards are in the right place here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: With this said, West did not have a raise of 2NT of course|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a kto nie kuma³ chiñskiego? olperator czy sêdzia?:):)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: there was no hurry to play clubs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|minimeck: These are tough hands to bid, 3@s only -1 here will deservedly pick up a few imps compared to 3nt |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even losing trump control is at stake.|pg||
nt|galallie:  yeah its a lucky game for sure|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|coolbeans:  Well, he's not making it now|pg||

nt|poohbear: Besides as long as I am playing non inverted minors I may as well use them!|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: it is a hand that I wish I had not played inverted:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|poohbear: Hi Ovunc|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: i would bid 1@d in other way, obviously not 1NT:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: At least you can blame Jeng for the poor result. I am generous, they get 100% each :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: To the specs who showed up late, this score is incorrect, the carry over was put in backwards. It is actually 22-14 in favor of Isreal|pg||

nt|agumperz:  perhaps it is just saying, i have values to compete but fewer than 4 spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bridgegoth: 3@D playing a strong club shows a solid @D suit, not necessarily a lot of HCPs|pg||

mb|1N|nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Youngsters, Poland vs England, at the moment winning 25-4 VPs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 10, they didn't cash those fast winners, so contract made and a major swing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks like.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: an drugim stole nie padla kontra na 2@s...|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The 7 card Major fit played better on board 9 with the void in @D|pg||
nt|jlall: this one should be fun, 7S is pretty good, if east is able to show 4 spades and short diamonds west can basically bid it|pg||
nt|jlall: if not, it will be much harder|pg||
nt|poohbear: hmmmm|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Give me two doubletons and I'll bid 1NT|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  But not with 3-3-6-1|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would if partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|asya13: Not my style|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|malipivo:  5@d-all pass, so a likely push and a missed opportunity for both teams.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  May I say it? :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 24 hcp 3NT coming it seems|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Australia and Italy are also currently qualifying for the Quarter Finals in the Youngsters category. A good sign for the future prospects of both countries at Junior level, once the current players become too old.|pg||
nt|sliynk: we lost 2 vps for a phone fine and lost some vps for slow play against denmark in the last match|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: she possibly(!) saw @sQ5 @c54:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: but opposite a non passed hand very dangerous|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|cicus: tough now - S will have to pass and N?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Permission granted|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Mozart's music for my ears.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Slam is on, dear spectators!|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3@h here a popular treatment, showing 3 spades, singleton heart, and 4/5 either way in the minors, GF|pg||
nt|minimeck: the same bid also exists for 3@s (1-3(4/5))|pg||
nt|minimeck: if partner chooses a minor, you can then bid rkc (kickback) if he bids 3nt, then you can simply bid 4nt or in this case 6nt, or bid gerber|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: in open room bd 11 NS were having a misunderstanding in the bidding, as N passed 2@c |pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n from South would be reasonable now.|pg||
nt|cicus: not on a 5 count|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, that's true|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am too on double dummy.|pg||
nt|cicus: N had an option to bid 2NT right away though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@h opener might let them make 1NT on a @h lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is sort of endplayed at first trick.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Nasty Andy. Semi psych picking off Zanasi's suit|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Now E can bid 4@D|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: is it a problem to open 1NT with singleton in Israel? I would understand American singleton-NTs in WBF events, but not sure about Israelian ones.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d looks like Multi. Shows an overcall with one major|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  2NT = Lebensohl, relay to 3@C|pg||
mb|3D|nt|keylime:  N/S got very high here and paid handsomely.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is cold here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now dealer is testing their bidding to 4@s.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: very disciplined|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I am impressed|pg||
nt|jlall: im guessing east shows a light splinter, when he shows that its diamonds west will probably bid 7S|pg||
nt|minimeck: dwyer much less likely to try something strange like that than owen :)|pg||
nt|goon1407: this is true|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but East is to the rescue with DBL|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I thought west could find reasons to bid 3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good spots|pg||
nt|MolvaM: two 8 spots and a 9 :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no deuce|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems to make actually|pg||
nt|poohbear: or 3@ds when you have a stiff @c :P|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: board 2 - singleton Ace 4441 1nt by West|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Now this is really weird|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: depends on what you mean by "opportunity" - against 6@d, West would have had the opportunity to lead a low heart and get a club ruff|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: expect them to land to 3NT here will probably bid 2@s now|pg||
nt|cicus: I think he has too many losers to bid this high|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: lubie 3nt:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: DBL very agressive opposite a NV 3rd hand opener|pg||
nt|jlall: 4H probably = short diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: think 2NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  reopening would be nice from North.|pg||
nt|cicus: 5 losers - partner will raise 4@D with 3 tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but better than all other sorts of 10/11 counts with his QJTx in both @s and @C|pg||
nt|minimeck: Here Siderov chooses to show his 5cd minor and continue in a forcing auction|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Indeed, this treatment is working nicely on this deal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  W/E have an incredibly lucky minor position being 3-3.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2 down probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|garden2005: TRUDNE DECYZJE|pg||

pc|h6|nt|malipivo:  And it is not, well done England!|pg||
nt|galallie:  well done EW|pg||
nt|poohbear: Now the question is : knowing that @hs are 6-1 and no entry to hand. Do we finesse the @d?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: need to find the @C ruff to win the board here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT would be off on a @s lead, but 2NT can be made if declarer gets 4@d tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  two tens are helping|pg||
nt|cicus: even 4@D is a stretch when partner could not act over 3@H|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: a pas chyba jakos tam forsuje...|pg||

nt|lukasz1982: :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice lead to start with|pg||
nt|poohbear: Zanasi shows close to a 2NT opener for this sequence so DiFranco has an easy 3NT bid|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Safe lead, but it won't make a difference as long as the Diamonds split reasonably|pg||
nt|jlall: if south had 2 diamonds and Jx of spades, he would need to duck the spade so that he could overruff diamonds later...not relevant here of course|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: oh, I see - 5@d was played by North, and East led a club anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I must admit I am not that disciplined (among other things), but I would respond 1@d as I would like to know more about partner's hand.|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I'm a bit surprised he didn't bid 1S if he was going to semi-psych ... given that it's more preemptive.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hung got his partner off to a good lead|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 11, they are in 3@dS.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|malipivo:  yes, exactly|pg||
pc|d6|nt|malipivo:  and here comes a spade ruff|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Indeed.  He clearly knows more than I do :p|pg||
nt|poohbear: @s lead works as well|pg||
nt|poohbear: Singapore winning max and now has a comfortable lead over Denmark|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the last spot|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hung will need to know to shift to @cs and not @ss when in with the @h king|pg||
nt|poohbear: so nothing clear at the moment on this hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Would overtaking @dT with @dJ help defense?|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes|pg||
nt|poohbear: because then if declarer ducks Hung can shift to a @s and get a Negative signal|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  The card Nabil plays when declarer takes the H finesse should be suit preference between C and S ...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrdct: entry to east is gone now|pg||

nt|ovncylmz: @DA is better haha|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Oh yes. Declarer has only one entry to table for the pade finesse. A club exit will, indeed, squeeze Hung in the majors.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cQ|nt|uni_dennis: can make 3N actually, N has no entry for another @s return|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: i tak mo¿na i tak mo¿na|pg||
nt|poohbear: And if West doesnt cash the @cs then declarer makes by force|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Remarably similar to a hand I played against Nabil and Andy back in the 2008 Australian Junior event.  Except I didn't get it right :/|pg||
nt|poohbear: everything depends on what he thinks about the bidding and the defense. West's @c play showed panic so not likely to be looking at the major kings|pg||
nt|poohbear: with @h Q as entry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|malipivo:  Declarer is afraid of heart position.|pg||

nt|gruffydd:  Very well played!!!|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  No kidding|pg||
nt|sliynk: NED win round robin unless isreal win 14 on last hand but seems semi normal game|pg||
nt|poohbear: Netherland can still lose imps and allow Israel to sneak in|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Edgtton is busy figuring out that he's in trouble. He does best to cash one club and exit a spade, I think, given that Zanasi has pitched a spade from dummy.|pg||

mb|2D|nt|mrdct: i need to head off shortly to as it's about a 10 minute walk to the venue which i think will be a pretty happy score-up|pg||

nt|bebechira: kind of choice :)|pg||

nt|minimeck: Undo|pg||
mb|2S|nt|malipivo:  They were down in 5@d and 6@d, so it is strange way of calling it an opportunity (to bid slam).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no overcall from east with 5-5?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  We here are fortunate to have Justin Lall as a commentator. Justin is a top tier US player who just missed the age limit for this|pg||
nt|jlall: 3 months too old, blame my paretns :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: lets see how far Levy Preempts|pg||

mb|5D|nt|ianmcc: another big result in OR|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@c or 5@d has no play potential, so likely 2!n-pass|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *playing|pg||
nt|malipivo:  or 3@d, we shall see soon enough|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Quite close slam, but it is not there.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: the multi did its work|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer in 4@h will be in a lot of troubles.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so only a double and a diamond lead needed now|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a diamond to ruff, a heart, a diamond to ruff, ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And now a battle for overtricks.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 club is not a very profitable save. goes -500 and might also be 800 if declarer loses control|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ahh yes the shapely hand cannot contain his excitement|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south could have a variety of hands. so north was supposed to pass|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but france is on a roll|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@h should show 2 kC|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl 0 pass 1|pg||

nt|ianmcc: bye Dave|pg||
nt|dburn: will have to revise my appraisal - East-West can almost make a slam here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this will make, just losing 1@h, 2@c and 1 or 2 trumps|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: won't go wrong in @s |pg||
nt|tez: ''minors''|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I saw 4@h as -3.|pg||
nt|minimeck: When west gets in with the queen of clubs may need to shift to a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: i can't redeal the 14th|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3 major N-S has a great potential|pg||
nt|z_lasu: E w pierwszym ruchu spasowala, a jak doszlo do niej 3pik to powiedziala 3ba|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  sure, after a non-spade lead :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: czy to prawda, ¿e 4@s?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s bid is a testament toHung's "solid " overcalls and his declarer play|pg||
nt|jlall: interesting choice by north to bid 2S, if partner is 5-4 or 5-5 then I would think pass was better hoping for 5-5...but it worked well here as it induced a balance from hollands|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I am kidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: they can also make a couple of overtricks in 3NT redoubled, which scores more than a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, that's a missed opportunity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@sX would be -3, I guess|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It cannot be more as we see a fast loser in every suit.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hm, declarer is missing entries, he might go down. :(|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Entries are crucial for repeated finesse in spades.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  All about the spots in this slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: right|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Great bid by the Jengs|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: i like @S9 lead now:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this will go down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|malipivo:  or more likely 4@hX|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so this time a few imps to the Netherlands|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer has to work hard|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can make it if he guesses the stiff trump king|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: not quite clear why South decided to double 3NT - I can understand why he might double 6NT, but below that...|pg||

nt|galallie:  Like i said earlier, zach loves to bid non vul|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I dont think 2nd seat equal is the right time to make a wild bid though|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i like the 3@H call|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  although it is not a success today|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Also the threat of missing a 5-4 spade fit to play a 6-1 @H fit|pg||
nt|galallie:  i would do 2h|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Is Kaplan thinking of running to Gerber?|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: Thank you to all the specs, as well as the great commentators and operators who helped make this happen|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: We hope to see you all shortly for the 2nd quarter!|pg||
nt|agumperz:  8 IMPs away|pg||
nt|galallie:  the next quarter is in 1 hour 25minutes|pg||
nt|agumperz:  but I still give Zach full credit for enterprise, despite the many comments I have received from those who prefer their preempts more sound.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  thanks everyone|pg||

nt|johnjones:  Good job on the defense|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the meantime, next matches start in 1 hour and 40 minutes according to:|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: another small pick up here maybe|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: yes looks like a small pickup|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: slam here again|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with @hQx with East and @sK in West 12 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  vugraph operator is playing differently from players, just kidding, 3@S=|pg||
nt|z_lasu: slabe rozdanie ale duza strata sie nie zapowiada|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i don't really understand 2@c by N in OR|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He is the man at our table at that deal.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok no more predictions :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The actual way was probably a heart to ruff and a club towards !K or a low club. It is hard to say.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the hand went between -2 and making and ended up -1 which was what it should be|pg||
nt|poohbear: so how do you penalize them|pg||
mb|1D|nt|uni_dennis: with 6hcp you are happy to pass 1NT|pg||
nt|tez: no defencive error..wd|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@cX looked down two, but it would be phantom sacrifice.|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: i possibly Double with West|pg||
mb|1H|nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ciê¿kie rozdania w tej sesji - obroty z niczego siê robi¹|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@c more a matchpoints bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hung did well to guess to lead a small @c from dummy|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: and pass with east to be rich|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: i mean|pg||
mb|3N|nt|malipivo:  4@h and defence can think about 4@s doubled|pg||
nt|cicus: good partscore for China in OR|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@D weak-2, again only having 5 and a lousy hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice distributionla hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: always good vugraph material|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: over my pd's 4@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results for all three series here:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The slam has its chances with a non-spade lead, but defense prevails them in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if somenoe goes for -1100 all the more interesting for kibitzers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@c?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@h?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@d?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I have rejected a slam for with a great level of confidence. :)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: i already made a aggressive 4NT bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  this is also a way|pg||
nt|minimeck: Last board here everyone, special thanks to Cam for assisting in this set, and to all of our specs as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: so you don't want to be in this slam|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west will like this rebid|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Unfortunate they lose many IMPs on this|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzjy: SOUTH didnit see his hands|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see merit in 1@S|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this might make though, if defense plays @S early|pg||
nt|tez: i dont like pass 3rd place|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ryskiel_: dwie siedemnastki w jednej randce rzadko siê zdarzaj¹|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but they don't really have a reason to do so|pg||
nt|tez: good 12 point|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Axxxx is good against a splinter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I would personally go for 4@c or 4@h with 6-4|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: I think he found a really good hand except the number of trumps|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, a risk of club lead is obvious|pg||
nt|MolvaM: agree|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c shows a max raise to 2@h . Drury convention|pg||
nt|poohbear: South broke one of my cardinal rules|pg||
pc|c4|nt|keylime:  One of the specs reports it's 20-12 if the score holds.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Correction 20-12.|pg||
nt|keylime:  20-10|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but getting to East hand for a club ruff is difficult|pg||
nt|malipivo:  some people treat xxxxx as four card suit|pg||
nt|tez: nearly 5@c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We could see a similar situation yesterday, a bidding side is missing AK in one suit.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and bid 4@d with 5-4 hands but thats me|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on the way to a losing slam|pg||
nt|goon1407: Thanks for having me Matt|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tez: part score swing|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would prefer to be in 6@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It would have its chances, leading from Axx or Kxx is no beauty for defense.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theoretical 6@d, clubs would get a chance to be developed.|pg||
nt|jlall: DT shift feels normal but his club holding might make him hesitant|pg||
nt|goon1407: Thanks for the specs as well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|z_lasu: miejmy nadzieje ze nie zagra na singlowego za|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie powinna|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: znowu kompyter siê zestarza³?|pg||
nt|jlall: might even play a low diamond, catering to AJxx or something with his partner, so his partner can continue diamonds|pg||
nt|minimeck: There are still a vast number of boards to be played, this match is far from over. |pg||
nt|ovncylmz: partners nowadays never give me AKxxxx suit and @SK and singleton @d with 4@s bid:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Don't make marginal preempts with the Ace of your suit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cicus: but when you are relatively weak, raising partner is most important|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@h E-W is making as far as I can see|pg||
nt|jlall: certainly a reasonable play though doesn't look smart when partner has AQJ8|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yeah, the 10 would have been a great surround play here|pg||
nt|galallie:  cant always play double dummy, unless youre justin lall of course|pg||
nt|jlall: lol...if only that were true|pg||
nt|galallie:  :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I mean in other room|pg||
mc|11|nt|uni_dennis: 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: Looks like a very flat board|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, it is|pg||
nt|tez: zanasi why not 1@h?may be pd has 4card @h..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zanasi worried abt suit quality obviously|pg||
nt|tez: ginuus:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but 1@s was wrong|pg||
nt|poohbear: The chances are very slim that the opps have a slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: when you start with one ace|pg||
