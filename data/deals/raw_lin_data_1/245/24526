nt|toniemme: L'Italia schiera Zanasi di franco in aperta e dwelle cave (figlio) e gandoglia in chiusa|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  a lot of jumping on this hand...S has an easy 4@h bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can bid 4@s and N will compete to 5@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|malipivo:  4-card side suit in North is useful on this deal.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This might be an interesting and difficult 3!n.|pg||

nt|the_clown:  good morning|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  hi Michael and Yordan|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least he prevents the over trick|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Both tables landed in 1!nN.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|uni_dennis: this is the last round of the Round Robin|pg||

nt|malipivo:  I am also crossing fingers to Netherlands as Ms. Ticha, a Czech player, is playing there.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d may have been a stretch but the double by W is hard one to believe since he can't see too many defensive tricks...almost feel like he meant it as responsive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: bulgaria needs a good day to makr Rof8|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but 5@c made, so 8 imps to denmark|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defense could set up spades earlier esp. after a spade discard from South's hand. Never mind.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|malipivo:  So play was different than we saw. :( It happens.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Our first push board is coming.|pg||
mb|d|nt|malipivo:  I see slams everywhere and this shall be the case.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|toniemme: nord dovrebbe licitare 1@H e sud replicare 1@S (nord potrebbe avere 44 nobile e in qualche raro caso 33 nobile)..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  First imps to Argentina.|pg||
nt|the_clown:  unless they play very convervative preempts in second seat, double is very strange|pg||
nt|toniemme: la distribuzione salva una linea di gioco non propri ortodossa...dovrebbe comunque essere mano pari..|pg||
mb|4S|nt|malipivo:  6@s would work well as repeated finesse in clubs against @cQ is on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: declarer in 4@S took a very wrong line|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But the slam is risky, so let's expect 4th or 5th level here.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|malipivo:  I will explain, it is happening at this tournament:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If N-S gets to a slam, it looks it is there.|pg||
nt|cc469: reasonable contract but down on a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: welcome back I'll repeat the live scoring site http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A small mistake by vugraph operator leads to a different line.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Yes, very true spectators, we saw a line where declarer had to be endplayed, not his opponent.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6 imps to Bulgaria as the other room played 4@h=.|pg||
nt|andyv:  good bid as it rates to go down only 2|pg||
nt|toniemme: 3@S mostra una 54 di 13 15..|pg||
nt|toniemme: talvolta 4441..:):)|pg||
mb|6S|nt|malipivo:  Accurate defense in a diamond sacrifice may lose fast 7 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Leading a diamond is difficult for South.|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: dalle prime due licite parrebbe chiaro che a Sud piaccia "decidere" i boards in fase licitativa...fortuna vuole che il compagno non abbia 8 o 9 punti..cosa del tutto possibile|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1NT in OR|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: we have 2 top junior pairs playing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: @S switch needed here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, welcome to the slamland N-S!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other table is in 5@sN, so a swing is coming one or the other way.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  5@h can be made as the Ace of @h is stiff and declarer should be able to work out the club situation (E will run out of space to hold too many clubs)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is not forced to try finesse right now.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He may play an ace and get more information about distribution.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is also a potential squeeze in minor suits against West, if East would play @dK on the first round.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|uni_dennis: Lebatteux-Kilani have won the European Junior Pairs Championships last month|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Another swing is coming as other table is playing 6@sS.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|snigill: these teams are now number 4 and 5 when 2 days are left of the round robin|pg||
nt|copeyj: This auction was surprising - I would have thought if you chose to bid stayman with L'Huissier's hand you would follow it by bidding 2@H over 2@D to offer partner a choice of ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: majors|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|frankaus: last hand reminds me of a "ditti" - Q.  what do u lead from QJxx  ... A.... another suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  North is enjoying a game of bridge very much at the moment.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|uni_dennis: Bilde -Jepsen were on the team that won the Juniors World Championship in 2008|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: 6 @S only goes down with @S lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  I have missed first tricks as typing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is an opportunity for Argentina, they are still bidding.|pg||

pc|h9|nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, 5@h can go down with a @c lead by W but not sure why W would lead a club|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jafa: even without a club lead, there is too much to do|pg||
nt|toniemme: 9 prese per est ..|pg||
pc|d6|nt|uni_dennis: but as kibs say, lack of @d continuation suggests @SA in N|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|copeyj: down 3 is obtainable by drawing trumps - I think I would have rather played @DQ on second round of the suit from North but this is fine|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: these look like strange discards|pg||

nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

nt|toniemme: 2..:)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: There is a possible heart ruff.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: looked like @S to J|pg||
mb|1D|nt|malipivo:  As he is out of trumps.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They avoided it: 3!nS.|pg||
nt|snigill: a decent hand south has got there|pg||
nt|copeyj: possible 4@S here for N/S - we have all been in worse contracts but with @C 5-1 and trumps 4-1 this doesn't seem to stand much chance|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: wild bidding in OR here, EW ending in 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: NS play 1@S = 0-4@s, 1NT would be 5+@S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: we'll check that score for you|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: 1@S=0-4 @S F1R|pg||
nt|andyv:  E does have an interesting problem here|pg||
nt|the_clown:  would you bid with the E cards?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: after N opened 3@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|copeyj: would be nice to be able to bid 3@C invitational 5-5 here I suppose - perhaps this 2@C is gazilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is probably considering reopening.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h looks as a make.|pg||
nt|jafa: Important match for both teams, Denmark currently occupy the last qualifying spot (8th) while Australia are in 2nd and within striking distance of the leaders|pg||
nt|andyv:  you hate to sell out, but wrong vul|pg||
nt|the_clown:  I guess 2N is invit+ with 4 card support|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|malipivo:  This is going to be a match to be remembered!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: Declarer thinking a lot.|pg||
nt|copeyj: if that is the case then 2@C shows @S/@C 11-15 or any hand 16+|pg||
nt|snigill: 4 spades is a very good contract but...|pg||
nt|nickf: :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@D 4+, but could be 3 (4432 only i think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  3@c looked as a fine contract.|pg||
nt|copeyj: and 2@D probably says we are going to game opposite the strong variety|pg||
nt|snigill: bad bridge not to reach there|pg||
nt|the_clown:  and could be based on a very good fit and fewer HCP|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: they found the save against 4@h|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|toniemme: il contro di nord potrebbe essere ..entrambi i nobili oppure almeno 4 carte di cuori..almeno utilizzando le due piÃ¹ normali accezioni del contro sull'intervento di 1@D..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: spec says 1@h with 4@h-4@s, so 1@d can be done with 3 in a 4333 (better minor)|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: EW can make 3@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive game will go down....one finesse works, the other doesn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|the_clown:  y W has all the time in the world to switch to a @c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is having 3 fast losers and one slow (a diamond suit).|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Hearts are easily developed here, but transportation is a major problem.|pg||
nt|jafa: Milne will need to switch to a club when in with the AD|pg||
nt|jafa: only one chance|pg||
pc|c5|nt|malipivo:  After two rounds of heart ducking.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A club ruff would be 4th trick to the defence.|pg||
nt|the_clown:  ah I missed that declarer can get to dummy with a @s ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though with @c ruff this can be 800|pg||
nt|toniemme: il rialzo a 3@S spinge la licita dei nostri a livello 4..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|adonis18:  a monumental earn for the danes:)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If in 3!n, the fifth loser would come from a club suit.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|toniemme: 10 assi per il giocante che non avrÃ  problemi nonostante trovi il resto delle @S diviso 4 e 1..|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Also spades are blocked.|pg||
nt|luffe12:  appears that the board was won at other table|pg||
pc|h5|nt|malipivo:  I am counting upto 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so 10 imps on board one to denmark|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hackenbush: if anybody's gonna bid it's West with the stiff diamond and the black suits|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe E was worth a cue  instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|toniemme: il B2 ci costa 6 poichÃ© est rialza a partita ..non iirragionevolmente e contro la manche la difesa ha gioco fascile a incassare 4 prese data la posizione del mariage di picche|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: not that difficult for E|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: after 3@c by N|pg||
nt|malipivo:  After developing a trick in club suit, he is not forced to guess anything in spades.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|malipivo:  A spade and another room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So even 3@h might go down.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a slightly fortunate result for China in that you would want to play 4@S I think - but no game makes on this layout|pg||
nt|snigill: should be 7 tricks with this hans south should be more willing to play trumos rather than nt donÂ´t you think?|pg||
nt|snigill: trumps|pg||
nt|cc469: W should not be thinking this long|pg||
nt|luffe12:  odd defense - why not continue clubs right away - nothing runs away|pg||
pc|d3|nt|malipivo:  East is defending well, to be fair.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not much left to the hand...@h finesse off|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting play of 9@c by W...maybe they play MUD in the middle of hand?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: only 3 down now|pg||
nt|xenya: he has a whale of a hand -- suppose he bids 3@S, then W with Kxxxxx in hearts might cooperate with 4@C|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so another pick up for the Danes|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|malipivo:  And crossruffing for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|cc469: N cannot have singeton K|pg||
nt|toniemme: tiratello il contro competitivo di sud..ma il j@H il 10@D il 98 a @C sostengono un punteggio forse carente:):)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|malipivo:  OR is in 4@hS.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|copeyj: and I think it is down 1 only|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There was a potential for ruffing finesse in hearts, but he just missed it. South played well for doubleton @hKQ.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|snigill: d 1|pg||
nt|snigill: true|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|toniemme: scarto della cuori inutile..a prescindere dal significato delle @D giocate da est(un giocatore avrebbe il diritto di sbagkliare carta..) il taglio di 9 di @S si imponeva..|pg||

nt|malipivo:  from spec:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  its wrong score from other room... defence cashed AKS and AK trump out 170 impossible it was 2 down probably so 3 imps|pg||
nt|cc469: partner opened 1NT and with 2 aces S felt he had to double|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in battle for 8th place Singapore is playing Egypt, so they might score big |pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  This is hard to pass or just invite.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|toniemme: le francesi tirano fino a 4@S (notare che est decide di licitare le @S..e non le cuori:):)..e 5 punti ci portano a condurre il match..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Here is a problem, Vugraph operators are making small mistakes not following the plays correctly all the time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the scores are back in sync now the 1st 3 are all flat|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So the score in the scoreboard is usually the right result.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|toniemme: on entrambe le sale West interviene con 1SA...leggermente discitibile..si rischia di perdere il fit ideale..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: thin DBL by E here, but N has too may @hs to pick up something|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@c was made on board 3, so 5 imps to NL|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h is there|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N seems to be the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The other room is also in 4@s, but from South's side.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jafa: interesting pass by Adam, but 1NT should play well enough|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and they were only 3VP behind Denmark before this round, so a good result is needed here for Denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: dalla regÃ¬a avvertono che Israele aveva 10 punti di carry over ..quindi il punteggio reale del match Ã¨ 18 ISR 17 ITA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|toniemme: nonostante le @S favorevoli non c'Ã¨ modo di fare piÃ¹ di 9 prese ..come del resto hanno fatto le francesi in sala apeta|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: easy 11 tricks|pg||

nt|malipivo:  It is tempting to be in !n contract E-W, well, East is weak in diamonds and there are no side entries.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  As a fan to slams, this one is close, but missing two aces.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  They are transferring to a diamond contract. 3@d it is as in the other room (they play it from East hand).|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  This shall go down heavily soon.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: looks like 2@C was GF|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: N using 4th suit to make a GF raise in @hs, 3@h over 2@d would be invitational i guess|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kiwibridge: and 2@H on 5 gives Argentina the 1st imps of the match|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: bd 4 2@c -1 in OR|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@C should show @h fit. with @s N can bid 3@s and with @D support he can bid 4@d|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: France in OR also in 6@h after N started with a GF 2NT (3+fit) bid|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|jafa: 9 tricks here if declarer plays on clubs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@h +1 looked a bit strange as well, as declarer still had to lose a trump|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|toniemme: on entrambe le sale sono le francesi ad assumere l'iniziativa...ovest in terza posizione apre leggera e con scarsi requisiti distribuzionali..qui sulla bicolore @D @C sud ripete la ...|pg||
nt|toniemme: quinta di @H...non bellissima ..|pg||
nt|toniemme: avrebbe fatto meglio a passare..talvolta il compagno ha 5 carte di fiori..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so the captains have to check the scores after this match|pg||
nt|cc469: good decision by E imo as his hand has no enties for his p in NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they bid 7, they  better know a good rabbi|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in OR South recieved a @d lead, but luckily for Denmark this will always make|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jafa: although communications are awkward|pg||
pc|c4|nt|uni_dennis: more and more pairs use some sort of relay over a 1M opening|pg||
pc|cT|nt|uni_dennis: would work fine here as N will then here the 2641 shape and then he has a very good slam hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It will be interesting to check the results from other tables.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but natural bidding works out just fine on this one|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If you are wondering why it is not doubled (in general), because N-S may escape to 4@c contract.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jafa: if he plays a club to the king and then a diamond to the queen and ace, the defenders would be able to knock out his last entry to hand|pg||

nt|toniemme: Ã¨ stata una pausa pubblicitaria..|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  As I see slams everything, this might be one.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in N the defense can start with 3 rounds of @s for a @d pitch and then the @D ruff will mean -1|pg||
mb|2N|nt|uni_dennis: in OR 4@h made|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: because it was played by S |pg||

nt|toniemme: prodotto da buona valutazione..|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for N to bid 2@h?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot that @hQ is not an entry on this deal. It could but that's not today.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  What a lead!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  But make it anyway as @cA wasn't played.|pg||
nt|cc469: S is not sure he has 2 cashing @Cs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: ah, the @s ruff in other room meant he could set up @ds, here E has 3rd @h left|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so much more difficult here|pg||
nt|xenya: very tricky, to say the least|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think you have to strrip squeeze West, including finding the lucky fall of @H10|pg||

pc|h8|nt|cc469: blackwood enquiry showed 2 aces without the @HQ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defence must be careful to cash @cA in time.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|toniemme: l'attacco a @D ..peraltro obbligato dalla licita rimette un poco in sesto il 3@S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Otherwise 3 spades provide enough winners.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|toniemme: speriamo nel claimm..|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s8|nt|uni_dennis: then E could have bid 4@s with his singleton @h |pg||
nt|malipivo:  Playing @dA at first trump attack would be better.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|malipivo:  3!n might go down on a perfect defence|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: looks like Singapore is going to score the maximum against Egypt and since Denmark got a penalty of 0,5 VP (don't know why) Denmark must score 23-7 in this match|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so need to win by 31+ imps if i'm correct|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  well, 2@s would be on if it stays this way|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 10: 2 imps at stake as 2 overtricks mean 60 points. Players scored maximum in this room.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In a possible heart slam, defence must cash diamonds soon, as spade finesse (@sT) and also double finesse in clubs (@cQJ) provide enough winners to discard a @d6. Otherwise it would be 6@h+1.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But this is a theory.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 3@C usually 5-5 already, so supporting @c looks best|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If E-W would attack diamonds at every opportunity, @cT might score the 5th trick for defence.|pg||

nt|toniemme: urka se 3@D mostra fit a picche e singolo west puÃ² licitare direttamente la josephine...|pg||
nt|nevaio: se il compagno ti da sing. a quadri fit 4to e dama d'atout..si puo' provare 7|pg||
nt|nevaio: di la' e' a|pg||
nt|nevaio: n|pg||
nt|nevaio: andata uguale 3q fit e singolo 3c ch|pg||
nt|toniemme: Ã¨ il 78 dell'84..(sono percentuali)...|pg||
nt|nevaio: 3sa sing a quadri..dovrebbero chiamare 7|pg||
mb|3H|nt|uni_dennis: on a finesse|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a pure slam? nice!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: probably end up in 5@h after discovering the lack of 2 keycards|pg||
nt|nevaio: c|pg||
nt|nevaio: h|pg||
nt|malipivo:  E-W are losing a heart and a diamond suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play but 14 valuable imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  now only 1 VP seperates Denmark from Singapore which is having it's way with Argentina, 71-5|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and france or china 4th and 5th, but they probably have to play against each other anyway if nobody picks them|pg||
nt|nevaio: Di la' 7p..in 2 licite clap clap|pg||
mb|3S|nt|toniemme: urka ..pagata la 1100....se surcontra potremmo pareggiare il board:):)|pg||
nt|toniemme: forse voleva un asso in piÃ¹ per surcontrare???:):)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  or "phantom throw-in" if East really played @dA and another diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|nevaio: pure qui..|pg||
nt|nevaio: 3sa sembra chiedere il sing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Both 6@c and 6@h would go done, let's hope for a game contract.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *down|pg||
mb|4C|nt|malipivo:  Hm, these are dangerous waters for Argentina.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: need some operator undos here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  operator: it shall be east-west, we believe|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: according to the dutch coach the operators don't speak english and don't understand bridge...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It remainds me someone I wake up with.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: my guess is that EW bid this way, so 2@c Drury and E chose not to investigate slam potential|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and will make 12 tricks or maybe 13 if S doesn't lead @c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and now it looks we are frozen :(|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other table is actually running.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: Operator is trying to lead from the wrong hand:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: they are playing bd 10, van Lankveld did indeed bid 3@h after 1@s - pass - to show a 4-card raise in @s |pg||
nt|malipivo:  let's do our homework in the meantime, how many tricks in 4@hN?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so they might save in 4@s there or push them up to an interesting 5@h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: van den Bos already bid 4@s|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and 5@h by south, dbl by East|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@cX would be expensive, 7 tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: well, if the dutch juniors don't bid it, it will be a bad contract indeed :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, undoubled :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  they have at least one trick in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@hX on bd 10: @d lead, @s switch, now declarer has a chance to ruff 3@D in dummy|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@hN would be -9, 900, 5@cX -4 for 1100|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@hX was made so 6 imps to Argentina|pg||
nt|malipivo:  that's good news|pg||
nt|malipivo:  According to my experience, this table will crash down and will be reopened. Let's see.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the meantime, let's tell something about the tournament|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  If you are using older BBO version, there shall be "Movie" button.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is not our first timer at this tournament as we see Axx(xx) opposite Kx as a potential for ruffing.|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  USA1 and Italy seem secure in their 6th and 7th spots|pg||
mb|5H|nt|malipivo:  Any voters for 5@c as sacrifice?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: USA1 and Italy are 6th and 7th, and battle for 8th is between Denmark and Singapore|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|malipivo:  even overtaking @dQ with @dK seems reasonable|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: there will be carry-over to the quarter finals|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: depending on the result between the teams in the Round Robin|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rossoneri:  Will be interesting to see how this affects the decision of the top two teams in selecting their choice of opponents|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the carry-over is half or one third of the IMPs|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW did get to 3N making 4 in other room.  Of course, S had a chance to defend 1NT here|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: both Netherlands and Israel did well against Italy|pg||
nt|toniemme: argomento interessante:):) ...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Nicely done and 11 imps to Netherlands.|pg||

pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  Well, 10 imps to Israel.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|uni_dennis: meanwhile we forgot to watch the play, 3N was made in the other room after a @c lead, and 2 off here, so 13 to France|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|malipivo:  2@D was transfer to @H, east forgot it|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: this will be a double partial as 3@h makes|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|uni_dennis: but both sides can only go to 5-level|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has a lot of work to do...he may try cashing the A@h, and play a @c to K and ruff a @h|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: all of a sudden we have imps galore and much blood|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats more like it :)|pg||
nt|jafa: 3NT is the spot here, hopefully Edgtton and Milne are on the same wavelength regarding the 2S bid|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: nice 4@c bid by W here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  sacrifice at 5th level may be real|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: got them to 5 level, but still an easy make|pg||
nt|andyv:  then he can hope for K@s to be Kx onside or @cs to be 3-3|pg||

nt|malipivo:  spectators for joining us at this table, their wisdom, and we wish the best luck to all the participants in next matches! This is a great experience for them at the international level.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nevaio: noi abbiamo  Delle Cave(Giuseppino)e Di Franco che sono i veterani ed i forti della squadra|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Last, but not least, our thanks go to our Vugraph operator! Very well done!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Next round starts in about 40 minutes according to the BBO plan:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  from spec: 4S is stone. lead @C also make|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @cKQ are sitting nicely for declarer.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Sooner or later a @cT will score 10th trick.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|malipivo:  yes, very true: for @C ruff S must take A@S 1st round - compressing original trump trick !|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: I would have expected W to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: opening 4@h is a way to get there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toniemme: uno slam non brutto...ORRIBILE...il board sarÃ  pareggiato a 3SA e dopo attacco a picche lisciato il giocante farÃ  circa 12 prese:):)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  interesting treatment of the majors by W|pg||
nt|jafa: 1S is no 4cM, or 5+D and a strong hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@h will be down but a bunch of imps for Netherlands.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|uni_dennis: looks like 5@c is a good save for -300|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  hard for N to sacrifice looking at 2 aces and the Q of @H though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and could well be 500 or more|pg||
nt|nevaio: Gandoglia ,al debutto internazionale ;sta giocando bene...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cc469: I find 2NT opener by E unnecessary - |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I think we need some undo's|pg||
nt|toniemme: notate come gli interventi in barrage siano una caratteristica tutta francese..le nostre al massimo sbarrano a livello uno..|pg||
nt|christinas:  dangerous board, they might get to 6H!|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks down one.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  as pointed out by spec, in OR, it looks as if NS went off 1 in 4@s, not 2 if you look at the vugraph movie.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so, this will be a push and denmark will need to find 15 imps on the last 2 boards as singapore is on a 25 now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|toniemme: ora dopo 5 giri di fiori speriamo che ovest legga il finale...un pinto Ã¨ sempre un punto..!!!:):)|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|malipivo:  It was useful free finesse as East is marked with longer hearts.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|toniemme: corretto stop degli israeliani..buon attacco di sud e corretta lettura della carta di attacco (busso da parte di Nord..|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  when you have shaky trump, the opps can at least be decent and have the suit split 3-2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|christinas:  it can only make if declarer ruffs 2 diamonds, pitches a diamond and spade on the AK of clubs, plays the K of hearts and guesses to finess the nine|pg||
nt|nevaio: era meglio tornare cn il 10 d'atout|pg||
nt|nevaio: rispetto agli e|pg||
nt|toniemme: auspicando buone @D a Sud la giocata di 10 avrebbe assoggettato una eventuale dama o il re come nel caso alla tenaglia di Sud...Nord ha fatto risparmiuccio:):)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nevaio: europei juniores noi senza Madala..ma loro senza un paio di giocatori forti(Birman,ed un altro che nn ricordo)|pg||
