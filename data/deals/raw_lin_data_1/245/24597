nt|malipivo:  China could have crossed 42-difference for their 25 VPs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now an opportunity for Costa Rica.|pg||
nt|cicus: NS might try 3NT here|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: tak wygladalo. zamarcie i claim|pg||
nt|tez: 4@s down 2|pg||
nt|poohbear: wasnt paying attn . Might have been a very funny squeeze on East|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Nicely defended!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But it would go down as far as I can see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results for all three series here:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would like to by in 3!nN.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is a great chance for them.|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@H for both majors?|pg||
nt|goon1407: wonder if it will be another joe grue 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Youngsters, Poland vs England, at the moment winning 25-4 VPs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 10, they didn't cash those fast winners, so contract made and a major swing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks like.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: an drugim stole nie padla kontra na 2@s...|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The 7 card Major fit played better on board 9 with the void in @D|pg||
nt|jlall: this one should be fun, 7S is pretty good, if east is able to show 4 spades and short diamonds west can basically bid it|pg||
nt|jlall: if not, it will be much harder|pg||
nt|poohbear: hmmmm|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Give me two doubletons and I'll bid 1NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: Not me|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  But not with 3-3-6-1|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would if partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|asya13: Not my style|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  5@d-all pass, so a likely push and a missed opportunity for both teams.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|minimeck: Now is a time for your slam pavel :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  May I say it? :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 24 hcp 3NT coming it seems|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Australia and Italy are also currently qualifying for the Quarter Finals in the Youngsters category. A good sign for the future prospects of both countries at Junior level, once the current players become too old.|pg||
nt|sliynk: we lost 2 vps for a phone fine and lost some vps for slow play against denmark in the last match|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: she possibly(!) saw @sQ5 @c54:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: but opposite a non passed hand very dangerous|pg||
nt|minimeck: Another slam time here|pg||
nt|minimeck: good pressure 2@s bid :p|pg||
nt|adonis18:  and one that makers:)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  makes|pg||
nt|minimeck: spades 5-1 and hearts 3-1 make it not a claimer, but might make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cicus: tough now - S will have to pass and N?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Permission granted|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Mozart's music for my ears.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Slam is on, dear spectators!|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3@h here a popular treatment, showing 3 spades, singleton heart, and 4/5 either way in the minors, GF|pg||
nt|minimeck: the same bid also exists for 3@s (1-3(4/5))|pg||
nt|minimeck: if partner chooses a minor, you can then bid rkc (kickback) if he bids 3nt, then you can simply bid 4nt or in this case 6nt, or bid gerber|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: in open room bd 11 NS were having a misunderstanding in the bidding, as N passed 2@c |pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n from South would be reasonable now.|pg||
nt|cicus: not on a 5 count|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, that's true|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am too on double dummy.|pg||
nt|cicus: N had an option to bid 2NT right away though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@h opener might let them make 1NT on a @h lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is sort of endplayed at first trick.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Nasty Andy. Semi psych picking off Zanasi's suit|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Now E can bid 4@D|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: is it a problem to open 1NT with singleton in Israel? I would understand American singleton-NTs in WBF events, but not sure about Israelian ones.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d looks like Multi. Shows an overcall with one major|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  2NT = Lebensohl, relay to 3@C|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@h is on.|pg||
nt|minimeck: starting with x here seems normal|pg||
mb|3H|nt|keylime:  N/S got very high here and paid handsomely.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is cold here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now dealer is testing their bidding to 4@s.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: very disciplined|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I am impressed|pg||
nt|jlall: im guessing east shows a light splinter, when he shows that its diamonds west will probably bid 7S|pg||
nt|minimeck: dwyer much less likely to try something strange like that than owen :)|pg||
nt|goon1407: this is true|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot 3!n played from West only.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Both minor aces are sitting nicely for declarer.|pg||
nt|minimeck: south might have been tempted to simply blast nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but East is to the rescue with DBL|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I thought west could find reasons to bid 3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good spots|pg||
nt|MolvaM: two 8 spots and a 9 :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no deuce|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems to make actually|pg||
nt|poohbear: or 3@ds when you have a stiff @c :P|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: board 2 - singleton Ace 4441 1nt by West|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Now this is really weird|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to see them getting to slam on a lebensohl auction here|pg||
nt|adonis18:  2nt? scramble, Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|adonis18:  if lebensohl, N has undervalued his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: depends on what you mean by "opportunity" - against 6@d, West would have had the opportunity to lead a low heart and get a club ruff|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: expect them to land to 3NT here will probably bid 2@s now|pg||
nt|cicus: I think he has too many losers to bid this high|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: lubie 3nt:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: DBL very agressive opposite a NV 3rd hand opener|pg||
nt|jlall: 4H probably = short diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: think 2NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  reopening would be nice from North.|pg||
nt|cicus: 5 losers - partner will raise 4@D with 3 tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but better than all other sorts of 10/11 counts with his QJTx in both @s and @C|pg||
nt|minimeck: Here Siderov chooses to show his 5cd minor and continue in a forcing auction|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Indeed, this treatment is working nicely on this deal.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec and yes: 5@h go down on diamond lead.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|keylime:  W/E have an incredibly lucky minor position being 3-3.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2 down probably|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is another battle: down two or three?|pg||
nt|warrens:  in 6@H, @S lead, cash @H Ace, 3 rounds of @C's, trump to hand, ruff another @C, no way back to declarer's hand.  is there a way to make it that's normal?|pg||
mc|9|nt|garden2005: TRUDNE DECYZJE|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: a teraz?|pg||
nt|garden2005: dzie√± dobry wszystkim|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: witaj!|pg||
nt|kania12:  Czesc Grzesiu|pg||
nt|garden2005: przypomina to pokera|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: przejrzales juz nowosci na youtube?|pg||
nt|kluk: najgorsze, ze te 4 kiery idzie!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so another pick up for bulgaria|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is only 14-imp difference, it might vanish even in this round!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  North knows she may get endplayed.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Making 6 here looks a tough ask, with spades 5-1 and hearts 3-1, don't see the entries to rough 2 clubs after drawing 1 trump|pg||
nt|minimeck: We shall see, NS have bid it in the other room|pg||
nt|minimeck: A possible chance for israel if they stop here|pg||
