nt|hackenbush: Lee takes his time. In the last World University Bridge Championship, he took 10 minutes for a play decision in a slam|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Then he will go for several hands and play at the speed of light.  But when he thinks, it will be for a while.|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Welcome and welcome back!|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: another slamish hand |pg||
nt|malipivo:  Good morning/afternoon/evening from the Czech Republic, my name is Pavel Striz and hopefully I will be (one of) your guide(s) in this match at this table helping out with typed commentary. |pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please feel free to personal message me during the match but also please don't be offended in any thinkable way if I don't respond to you or if I don't pass your notes and ideas to the audience. |pg||

nt|malipivo:  China currently standing 2nd (140 VPs), Costa Rica currently standing 19th (55 VPs).|pg||

nt|malipivo:  yes, @sK is sitting nicely|pg||
nt|malipivo:  What a slam, I hope they will bid it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer on a non spade lead can strip the hand and knowing that North has at most 2@ss from the bidding can play ace and a @s to the Q and claim no  matter who has the king|pg||
mb|p!|nt|johnjones:  NS missed game for +170 only, so this will be the first real blood of the match!!!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is real bridge, so a peaceful contract and fight for overtricks.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  On a non-spade lead slam has its chances.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching the 14th World Youth Team Championships:|pg||

nt|lukasz1982: i to juz od 9, czyli 3 naszego czasu (ale naszej reprezentacji w tej kategorii w tym roku nie ma)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: *3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We are in the middle stage of the round robin playing 16 boards.|pg||

nt|kluk: witam wszystkich, ktorzy wstali wczesnie, zeby podziwiac nasze dziewczeta|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: dzien dobry:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  A typical pushy vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  a trump will be the best lead for the defense|pg||
nt|hackenbush: to be fair, game was far from laydown|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/TaicangScheduleOfPlay.pdf|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results and running scores for all three series here:|pg||
mb|6H|nt|johnjones:  True, but the layout looks friendly enough for both 4H and 3NT to work.  |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hop avoided the @c lead, so will go 1 off|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h is a fine contract for the other side, diamonds providing winners fro a club discard|pg||
nt|minimeck: North very well might take the plunge here, not the best shape however|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Three suits double stopped.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rzecz nie w wicie lecz w licytacji w poprzednim rozdaniu|pg||
nt|minimeck: a narrow target shooting for -500 |pg||
nt|minimeck: :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theory, 4@s is going down 3, let's see if they find it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  All three series are playing the same boards, we may compare their results afterwards easily.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: 1@d = pewnie @h, a kontra fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West should bid the slam. singleton @c and an important @s card|pg||
nt|poohbear: and sure enuff|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It was a nice bid.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He will have a right to play it, but bidding is not over.|pg||
nt|poohbear: save is reasonable|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@d went down a lot in the other room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot two diamonds ruffs in a club contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  with the CA wrong, down 1 looks likely|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'd expect a game too many versus a game too few from the juniors.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: lub cos:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: will normally make this, but he can go wrong|pg||
nt|poohbear: more likely 2 ruffs in a @d contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|johnjones:  Against that, Lee will to well to go down 2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They went down in 4@h in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|z_lasu: to prawda|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeste na tropie ktr=3 kiery|pg||
nt|kluk: wyglada na 11 lew|pg||
nt|kluk: przepraszam 10|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, thank you|pg||
pc|cA|nt|malipivo:  Declarer lead trumps too early forgetting his only chance: clubs.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Personally, I dont particularly like the odds of 4@s, his 3@s bid allready showed his hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: winning 3 imps versus losing a bunch if 4@h was not making, need to be pretty sure :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The risk is that 500/800 points are there for sure, 4@h might still have a chance to get beaten.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|uni_dennis: 4@sX -1 on bd 2, so 7 imps back to Netherlands|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, 4@sN, @hK lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If North would have three diamonds and two clubs, there is one possible ruff.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|poohbear: So lets see if Nabil can play it as well as he bid it|pg||
nt|poohbear: I say yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|malipivo:  Board 2 is a 12-imp victory for France.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the endgame, they developed them, but it was too late.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nasze i tak podwi³y liczbê impów w stosunku do pierwszego meczu|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: podwoi³y|pg||
nt|z_lasu: tutaj spory pech ze kiery 3-3 bo by bylo tylko 8 lew na bez atu, a w piki koncowka by szla|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale nasze te¿ graj¹ 3 BA wiêc o pechu nie mo¿emy mówiæ|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if he decides to take a @h finesse for example|pg||
nt|frankaus: prob duck @c in presumed safe (w) hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: IF he had not do that,the contract was "make"|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: playing on @c will get him home indeed with 2@s, 3@h, 1@d, 3@c |pg||
pc|h9|nt|lukasz1982: AJx kier jest przed kierami, wiec w zasadzie nic sie wielkiego nie dzieje|pg||
pc|h2|nt|uni_dennis: now no @c9 so duck to W|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defense is accurate.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Anything but a C now and declarer is sunk|pg||
nt|keylime:  I can't see North breaking open what appears to him/her as a half-frozen suit.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|lukasz1982: i dubel trrefl przy dublu kier, wiec nawet nie da sie przebic :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: @c9 would undo decl plan|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As we see, spades are 2-2, the third spade in South hand would be there waiting.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c2|nt|hackenbush: heading towards 3 down, if NS collects the @dK|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A D shift at trick 2 would have left the defense better placed|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he is working on it|pg||
nt|poohbear: I played with him in Australia a couple of years ago and he is a very good card player|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: i teraz juz 11 :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|malipivo:  In theory, diamonds would provide enough winners for club discards.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Even then, declarer would probably go wrong.  Grant Baze used to teach to guess the leader for the Ace in a premature underlead situation.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|uni_dennis: claim now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|uni_dennis: fisher hoping west has @sKx originally and forgot to unblock|pg||

nt|minimeck: :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Some people tend not to bid after !n opening, but North is "under hammer".|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot it in spades at least (finessing @sK is on).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, 4@sXE.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But that contract might go down on accurate defense.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  The advantage of @hJ9xx can be seen, but can be finessed.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c asked for a 5 card major and 3@d denied it|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West holding 4 hcps has no use for East, but 5 spades does.|pg||
nt|poohbear: so West has denied a 4 card major cause he would have showed it and all we know about declarer is he doesnt have a 5 card major|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|johnjones:  The defense appears to have 5 D and 2 S before declarer can get in|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even a low heart lead gives up a trick: @hT is above @hJ.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Or rather below.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 1 off here as well|pg||

pc|d8|nt|johnjones:  North has 7 stone cold tricks.  He can play for 3-3 C or the HA onside for 8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|malipivo:  Heart continuation is expected here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is getting endplayed in two suits.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  it might be interesting to see 3!n E-W losing only 4 aces|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sAJ were onside, @dJ as well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, it is a theory|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3 tens on this board were helping a lot|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and 3 nines as well|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  likely that brazil will be in 3nt on board 4, after all they do have 26hp|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: zdecydowanie tak|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Some days we will be in 4@s making, but today is not the day.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Some multi gadgetry here, european players likely to be more familiar with the followups :) |pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are losing 2 spades a diamond and maybe a club.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Some kind of pass or correct with preference to hearts i suppose|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kiwibridge: I don't like 6 card suits in 1NT so it always pleases me when it gets punished|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse is possible in clubs, but there is not enough transportation.|pg||
nt|kania12:  X od E|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: wielki problem wspolczesnego brydza|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: jakimi gramy transferami :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lukasz1982: ale moze tutaj nie wystapi :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the meantime, declarer went down on Board 2 after a diamond lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n would be nice contract on this board.|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|keylime:  I always have a good feeling when after pard opens a 1 bid, I have possibly more points than them. There's a certain comfort that goes with it.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  running scores on http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  7@d may force N-S to 7@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West didn't buy it and didn't cover with queen.|pg||
nt|minimeck: or a game try for either major it seems |pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's hope defence will cash their club winner.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@d asks partner to bid his best major|pg||
mb|4H|nt|uni_dennis: 3@h GF 5-5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason is that hearts are providing enough winners for club discards.|pg||
nt|minimeck: will still be ok, with east only having 2h :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  The Swedes appear to be playing that 3C would be a high level reverse and show extras.  That is a very sensible agreement.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Other table had a very lengthy, relay auction to the excellent contract of 6@d.|pg||
nt|kania12:  trzeba liczyc na pomoc|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  He had a Precison 2C bid available - it would have worked better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  EW clearly play very constructive preempts|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: jednak raczej nie bedzie zapisu dla nas|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @hQJ provide one entry to South.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  I agree; bidding 3@c here if you're a pattern bidder, causes problems due to the room once takes to show a club suit. I myself would rather rebid 2@h as a waiting call here then the 3@c bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it might|pg||
nt|poohbear: So this should be easy as declarer should play a @h to the 9 as his first play . The Jack pops second time so no guess|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: but they'll get some back here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with 5-4 they bid 2@C first and then Smolen (2@c-2@D//3@h as 5@S-4@h and 3@s as 5@h-4@s)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@s doesn't seem right to me. E has a good hand for slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In North had @hKx South hand would be entryless on accurate defence.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If @hK played, defense ducks.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|johnjones:  A spec messages me they do play 3C as a high level reverse - thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  North's hand should be prime now, and South with four shiny bullets might take a stab at grand here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4-1 diamond break coupled with the heart position hurts the chance for grand here a bit.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A grand is excellent without a trump lead, but iffy with a trump lead|pg||
nt|keylime:  You'd need entries, which at 7 on a trump lead becomes perilous.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec tells me they choose a natural sequence, but had relays available|pg||
nt|johnjones:  If that is the case, that shows excellent judgement because it put weight on the KD|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we may count a lot of tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe it should have done|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if W had a singleton @c you only need to find @hQ|pg||
nt|sliynk: he needs to be careful not to lead @HT as then a spade can be ducked and a ruff given with @H7|pg||
nt|poohbear: you there griff?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|malipivo:  fast winner counting: 1-2 hearts, 6 diamonds and two 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he will try it anyway|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|keylime:  And the T too. Both prime cards here.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|keylime:  Nice natural auction here to a likely push. Well done.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Which might be found with relays, but sometimes relays run out of room to find all exact cards.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially with pinpointing 5-5 hands. The frequencies are not as friendly as the 5431 hands.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I like South's decision to go natural, but think he wimped a little in not bidding the grand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a fair game here, reached after the opening instead of preempt. Needs 3-2 trumps and @hA onside, or some defensive help|pg||
pc|h8|nt|johnjones:  Good point|pg||
nt|keylime:  West has made a nice lead here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer doesn't know clubs are 3-3 and that hearts are not 5-2. So entry management will be important.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Another opportunity was to steal a club winner: leading a low club from North and hoping that ace won't be played at first round.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defence is ducking from time to time to get more information/signals from partner.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If low @h played, defense wins with @hA and @hK is blocking a heart suit.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|johnjones:  He'll be happy to not lose a trump trick though.|pg||
nt|keylime:  16 board segments for the Youth Teams in the RR.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  without a D lead it will make 5|pg||
nt|kania12:  dama kier?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kania12:  cos vugraph znowu tworzy...|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1NT overcall very agressive here with just 14hcp, no real suit and only Qxx in @h |pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime:  Playing under Cat 3 of the WBF regs, so no Brown Stickers or HUMs (Highly Unusual Methods).|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|malipivo:  and one more heart to the Polish team|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a diamond ruff coming, well done.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: first real slam hand here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: OR in 6@c after strong 1@c and a 4@D overcall|pg||
nt|malipivo:  welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: znou cos/kto wisi?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is no entry in South's hand, so squeeze against East looks impossible.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|malipivo:  Mozart's music for my ears: a slam zone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Poland clearly have a game plan - overcall 4@d on every hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 7@s and 7@c both very good contracts|pg||
mb|2C|nt|malipivo:  We shall see what level of risk they are taking.|pg||
nt|dburn: seems to be working well so far|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@C their only strong opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: treacherous 4@h here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, board 5: they are in 1!nN.|pg||
nt|poohbear: good slam here NS|pg||
mb|2D|nt|malipivo:  5@s might be on as double finessing in clubs is working|pg||
nt|kluk: Mam nadzieje:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 6@d will be 4 off only|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@C only contains strong hands, so pass on 5@d and now on 6@d will be forcing|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but think they haven't discussed this very much|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A slam requires one of the finesses.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  They got an overtrick there so tied after 5. This room is two boards behind now; how much time are they allocated - 8.5 min/board?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|uni_dennis: would pass or DBL on 5@d show interest to play something|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: pass on 6@d shows a hand to play (dbl would be penalty, usually BAL, semi-bal)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: although pass on 6@D will show interest in bidding, i don't know if Westerbeek thinks his @s 8xxx is enough to do so|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Scoreboard shows -1, it means that operator might get lost the actual play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: SRY,the network is too poor.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 8 imps for israel on bd 5 as 2@c went 3 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: .|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and if the slam goes down?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  one losing heart is going away on @dA, two more on club ruffs|pg||
nt|MolvaM: chopin's funeral march?  :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But the @hK is a problem.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|malipivo:  Possible 8-imp swing coming.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  any voters for slam?|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: tu sie chyba nic wielkiego nie dzieje - trzeba troche uwazac na komunikacje, ale jest Jx pik jak by co|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Welcome!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi pavel|pg||
nt|malipivo:  On this deal, @hA first and then a low towards @hQ would work, but that's double dummy play.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|johnjones:  On a lucky day 4H might make an overtrick, but not today.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This would be a risky one, but we may expect to see it at some tables.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: in the open room padon made a take-out dbl over 3@d lifting NS to 4@d, but that was still an easy make|pg||
nt|minimeck: this hand is certainly quite unfriendly, very well might limit declarer to 3 trumps and two aces|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  This Australian team is possible our best for many years. The culmination of some very hard work by the guys. They all have several years of international experience at U26 level.|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|malipivo:  On this deal a low heart from West to @hT is working.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @s98 are useful cards as trumps might be 4-2 or even worse.|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: as well as at the top levels in Australia|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  In this case, declarer may try to drop @hK.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|malipivo:  A diamond lead wouldn't be nice as it also kills one transport to West hand.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  meaning to play a low @h followed by a low heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Another sensible decision by North this time.  The H values aren't working, so he stayed off a direct raise.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So nice bids here|pg||
nt|keylime:  Their teammates going two off red in the other room, makes this important to make +140 to cover some of the loss.|pg||
nt|keylime:  In the other room, South overcalled a strong NT with a multi 2@d overcall, which drove W/E into 3NT.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The other room was down 2 in 3NT, which definately doesn't get the "sensible" award, although Multi is tough to deal with|pg||
nt|keylime:  Ten tricks are available here for South. The heart will jettison a club and the K@s is in the slot.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect that N/S in the other room maybe playing Multi-Landy or something similar.|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a transnational final|pg||
nt|poohbear: for Nabil|pg||
mb|4H|nt|johnjones:  For American  (ACBL) spectators, there is no written defense allowed in this competition|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  South might bid 4@d, just to say he is having support, leading from KJT is not easy.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: East thought that West might hold a hand with long @hs and W thought/hoped that 6@h would show a good 5-card|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  If slam goes down, I should congratulate opponents of setting me down.|pg||
nt|poohbear: We have 5 players in this tournament that played in the transnationals finals. West ( Edgtton ) and 4 Israelis|pg||
nt|poohbear: beat out many world famous players along the way|pg||
pc|c8|nt|MolvaM: well @hA first is a nice safety play|pg||
nt|poohbear: Israel has dropped behind the Netherlands in the all important run for first in the standings|pg||
pc|cA|nt|keylime:  That's right, so unlike here in the US, where certain items played permit the opponents of that treatment to have written defenses, on site it is all in the brain.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lukasz1982: @cK nie utrudnil raczej wziecia 10 lew|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|keylime:  There was a hand a few years ago, if memory serves Freeman-Nickwell were defending against the Multi 2@d opening. They had 15 pages (!) of notes for the Multi they were allowed to use to get to an excellent slam.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: ale W nie musialamiec J :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, indeed it is|pg||
nt|malipivo:  here we go!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but even declarer finesses he will not go down|pg||
nt|poohbear: good news for Israel is Netherlands has no place to go but down :P|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|MolvaM: since clubs are 2-2 and he can ruff 2 clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  French commentary in the other room, if it is your preference.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  From our perspective it is easy to see everything.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: It helps when you have everything in writing. Pathetic|pg||
nt|keylime:  And Roland, in our mid-chart events, we can play any defense over 1NT, without any disclosed defenses.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The ACBL is ridiculous in its treatment of Multi defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Outside the US you have to remember stuff. We call bridge a mind game|pg||
pc|hK|nt|uni_dennis: but in a way strange by W. he wanted to play 6@s opposite some fit, but now E bids 6@h he believes it can only show a good suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, one more advantage for declarer.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|keylime:  Yet, xfers over natural 1 club opening demand a written defense, and that is a lot easier to cope with.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: znowu?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We shall also note that clubs breaking 2-2 is a great advantage of those two ruffs.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: you are watching match 16|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the round robin consists of 19 matches|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@s would go down if defence cash their @h+@c winners.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 5, they are in 4@s.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It might easily go down!|pg||
nt|poohbear: what do you guys think of Neg dbl vs 2@h by North?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 8.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but NS will get to 5@c now|pg||

mb|2S|nt|malipivo:  Poland has crossed 42-imp difference, so at the moment it is 25-4 VP.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so after tomorrow evening, the first 8 ranked teams will proceed to the quarter finals|pg||
mb|d|nt|malipivo:  We are enjoying momentum of seeing scores from the other table.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and that's an interesting contract|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Yes.  A better method might be to play 2C to show a (possibly weaker) heart hand and 2H to show a good hand with clubs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  But the battle is not over.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: rdbl is?|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: declarer might play W to have @sQ for his overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Poland youngesters were having great first half yesterday, but losing slightly the second.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but the problem are hearts itself|pg||
nt|poohbear: Looks like East took West's dbl of 2@s as takeout|pg||
nt|poohbear: In that case West is SUPER aggressive|pg||
pc|cA|nt|malipivo:  I mean vice versa.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, England may start the long road back here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, take @dK with an ace and finesse everything against North|pg||
nt|poohbear: oops|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Uh oh|pg||
nt|malipivo:  :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and :( I am fair to both teams.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Nothing new, leading from Jxxx always costs a trick|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kluk: duzy umiar w zamknietym:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kluk: I beda plusy!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: at the moment italy is 7th and singapore is 9th ranked|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but counting points he may place all hcp's with south|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he is afraid that the @h finesse is not on as well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, indeed, so the endgame will be interesting|pg||
pc|d8|nt|malipivo:  As defence can attack only one suit, risky 3!n was on.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so this is one of the critical matches|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but there are 3 more matches (16 boards each) tomorrow|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is making this contract and another push.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Noble of you.  I guess at this stage I am too --- although only because for the Aussies the result of this match is likely to only make the difference between 2nd and 3rd|pg||
pc|hA|nt|malipivo:  but it would be down.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now cant stop south from gaining the lead in spades|pg||
pc|h3|nt|uni_dennis: E showing neutral with his 2nd @d, another indication about @sQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so will go down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|malipivo:  declarer is avoiding hearts|pg||
nt|malipivo:  this may cost the contract|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|key1809: ok|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|MolvaM: to make it, he needed to win the first diamond|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: italy is 20 VP ahead of 8th denmark curently so this match is more critical for singapore|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gruffydd:  If Australia are playing Italy tomorrow (possible) then the gloves are off!|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d5|nt|MolvaM: south waits happily and patiently|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer can make an overtrick if he guesses to endplay West. He will have a reasonably good count on the hand by then . AND it is worth an imp :P|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, West is endplayed for the 10th, right?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think Netherlands grabs Italy if available|pg||
nt|poohbear: for 11th|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  If he cashes the last trump and 2 clubs ... yes|pg||
pc|h9|nt|keylime:  T@d now a threat card|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Playing 2NT - 3NT as something other than natural is becoming increasingly popular|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he may try to duck a heart once to put more pressure on South|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  seems an unlikely line as it risks the contract, though :D|pg||
nt|poohbear: but may misguess if he plays for 5-4-2-2 |pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|nt|malipivo:  he will be happy if only one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: W hide his C|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2 extra rounds of trump might tell him something|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why North at the other table responded 1NT to 1@d, especially since in Polish style 1@d always shows at least four|pg||
nt|poohbear: He knows from the lead @ss are 5-2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: How young are the Jeng brothers?  13 and 11?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But again, it is more double dummy play.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|keylime:  They might be using some form of Muppet Stayman?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14 and 12 I am told|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The USBF site doesn't say, but they are young and look even younger in person.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Richard Jeng became a Life Master at the age of 10 in 2010!|pg||
nt|keylime:  And Adam Kaplan from my home state of  Florida wasn't much older when he got his. Now he's a Diamond Life Master I believe.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2 ovetricks needed for 6th imp.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|malipivo:  West is being endplayed in hearts|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  if diamond returned, North will be endplayed in hearts|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @d7, known as beer card, is not going to have its true value on this deal|pg||
pc|cK|nt|MolvaM: well if he places everything to south. why not?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sQ|nt|malipivo:  And it turns out to be guessing in hearts|pg||

nt|malipivo:  it is pity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East would be forced to play heart and it could be guessed in declarer's favor.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @s discard by E doesn't say that much, declarer's hand was clear already|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, you are right|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 13 hcp are out and south may well have them all|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is an opportunity for the other table.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  We have got a new leader in this match.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|uni_dennis: If W opens they are likely to end up in a game|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This looks like partscore battle.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As I see slams everywhere, this is not the case for N-S (2 aces off).|pg||
mb|d|nt|uni_dennis: 5@C only 2 down, but S will never support|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing 3@hE.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Fast loser count: we are losing a spade, a heart and a diamond.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: light opening by west|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would east try to penalize 2@h?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|malipivo:  Second diamond loser can be discarded via ruffing or via developed clubs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  Only about 1.5% give or take has made Diamond LM in the ACBL. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: W has revoked club 6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this a more routine 4@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: Singapore has snuck into the last qualifying spot edging out Denmark|pg||

nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@C puts a lot more pressure on than 3@c, but E has a simple 4@h with his flat hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and now S hopes they did wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like they will reach a thin 3nt|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theory a spade loser might get away on club winners if spades aren't attack first.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Club ruffing is not going to work for defence as South is also singleton in clubs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am mistaken here, thank you for spotting this from spec:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  you can only make 3 discards, not enough... from 5:)|pg||

nt|frankaus: this looks to be a make|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this lead makes it interesting|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: defense can now set up a @s before @ds are good, but might just lose 1@s 1@h 1@d|pg||
nt|malipivo:  that's very true, a @c7 is not a winner|pg||
nt|poohbear: depends on whethe rthere is carryover and who gets in|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Carry over = half of head-to-head result from the round robin, capped at some amount or other? Have I remembered correctly?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|johnjones:  1NT instead of 2S is interesting|pg||
nt|dburn: sensible contract, as is 1@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobry ranek wiernym polskim kibicom|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even 3!n would work well on this board.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Another push board.  We are watching a low scoring but well played match.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Possibly influenced by their limit opening |pg||
nt|malipivo:  N-S are risking being in 4@s.|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes. If you finished higher in the round robin. Otherwise its 1/3 of the cap|pg||
nt|poohbear: I belief the cap is 48 imps|pg||
nt|poohbear: at least thats the Bermuda Bowl rules|pg||
nt|poohbear: in the meantime NS have a shaky 3NT here|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Nabil is in the tank well and good|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@dX looked down two.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hard to pass 3@ds dbled when partner makes a takeout dbl and you have a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: down 4 on a low @D lead, played from france in youngsters|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think 3NT is a reasonable shot. |pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Nabil is thinking about what to switch to. Any of the three other suits might be right.|pg||
nt|poohbear: unfortunate for Zanasi that partner dbled purely in majors|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, oh yes, I am not blaming him with his next bid.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hackenbush: EW play precision|pg||

nt|MolvaM: oh|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|poohbear: not sure what Edgtton has against his QJ10xxx suit :)|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Possibly Nabil decided that the 2H *might* have been suit-preference, and absent any other indication he went with that.|pg||
nt|poohbear: but now he has an opportunity to switch to his 3rd non suit |pg||
nt|gruffydd:  His suit is a safe switch ... but he has no entries so he'll never enjoy it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 might have been forced play|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ryskiel_: nieco pechowo zaczêlimy ten mecz z £otw¹|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 7, N-S are bidding aggresively and buying 3!n.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It was due to @sT.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|keylime:  The bridge on VuGraph has been outstanding lately. The Spingold was gripping, and the Youth Teams already looks great.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  sneaky|pg||
nt|johnjones:  he may have wanted to set the Cs up for tricks though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the other room Padon responded 1@s, then supported @c before bidding 3NT, so @d6 lead there|pg||
nt|z_lasu: tu raczej nie da sie wygrac|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|poohbear: now a @d shift|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  5C clearly looked discouraging enough!! not sure why Andy (Hung) couldn't play the 7C instead of the 5C|pg||
nt|poohbear: and the defense will have played all 4 suits in the first 4 tricks in 3BT . Rarely see that :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gruffydd:  yes ... all 4 suits played by defense.  Not normally a good tactic|pg||
nt|poohbear: worked well here|pg||

nt|gruffydd:  Will do Barry. For the current edition which gives a short bio of each Aussie player at the event, see http://www.abf.com.au/youth/bulletins/JulAug12.pdf|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|johnjones:  He'll be OK since the HK is a reentry |pg||
nt|malipivo:  It may lead to an ovetrick in OR and an imp to England.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He might go down even in 3@s.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I read that yesterday :) very funny|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  East (Hung) is one of the editors|pg||
nt|poohbear: The alex mentioned is Alex Smirnov from the German national team . He is coaching the Aussie jrs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: first seat opener no matter how light should take 1-2 tricks normally|pg||
pc|s5|nt|uni_dennis: building his 9th trick in @c here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So swing is coming as they shall make it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: SO the board 7 has translated +1|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a diamond means a lot of trouble for declarer.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: he clearly is convinced trumps break 5-0, not strange with 4th best lead and @d 4-2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not happening in this match so far|pg||
pc|d8|nt|malipivo:  He would save a heart loser but losing trump control.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|johnjones:  The 5-4 heart fit looks better than the 5-3 spade fit, but the result will be the same.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  From bad it is turning to be ugly.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  meanwhile Declarer is in trouble.  Tried ducking in each suit, but that hasn't got him anywhere|pg||

nt|malipivo:  I am afraid so.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d4|nt|malipivo:  But likely a push board.|pg||
nt|dburn: West would not have passed playing a "standard" system, but East is limited to some extent by failure to open 1@c, which he would do with a really good hand|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: making now, just losing 1 more @h|pg||
pc|s4|nt|keylime:  Defense trying to score separate trump tricks here|pg||

nt|hackenbush: hi|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to prawda, ale nale¿y æwiczyæ odruchy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: trouble|pg||
nt|poohbear: A relay auction here|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|gronkvist:  Dbl showed 4+@s and 1@s showed 2-3 @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In a balanced 11-13?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS opens all bal hand 12-14/18-19 with 1@c and then play trf and relays after that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke is usually North and Ida South, right Johan?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This sequence will probably ends in 3@d or 3@h.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NS do not play a strong @c system, so they also start with a strong 2@c (22+)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@D is waiting|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room in 4@h, but I am afraid it is going down.|pg||
nt|dburn: but 4@c is... well, it is not clear that it is even a cue bid|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is just happy he is having strong hand, who wouldn't be? |pg||
nt|dburn: and even if it is, Huber should not be looking at a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  very true|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|uni_dennis: 5@d doomed on a @s lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3-imp difference, 16-14 in favor of Argentina|pg||
nt|malipivo:  On of the players must be bid aggressively to get there.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@h was 2-way: either NAT or a NT range, 2@S asked|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@D shows 6+@h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: without a 2nd suit|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I believe 2C is 3-way.  Either Natural GF, Bal GF or an invitational raise in spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  aj aj|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: widzê, ¿e wymieniali komputer... jak inni parowozy...|pg||
nt|tez: you can make 6@d but 3 nt imposible|pg||
nt|malipivo:  (with 3 more comparison from the other room)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: france has 3 good boards 7, 8, and 9|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n is nicely placed.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6,7,8 sorry|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|gronkvist:  studying 17 and 19 y brother and sister ;)|pg||
nt|dburn: if he wants to raise to 4@h no one would crime him, but 4@c shows clubs, not hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and Illingworth has raised those "clubs", as well he should|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East in Open Room leads @sK.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am told there is no slam.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, very true you are, i wrote that too early|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  None players are breathing right now.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even me.|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  The rest I'm not privy too.  We can assume they've found their H fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont think inv in @ss likely since that would make the 2@s bid strange|pg||
mb|4H|nt|uni_dennis: other room 1@d pass 4@h !! by van Lankveld, all pass|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: is this correct?|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And a swing for Costa Rica.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I will rather eat my hat if he plays low.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: w schoolsach 31:20 dla naszych zawodnikow|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: maybe S forgot the system|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: South PASSED|pg||
nt|tez: hýmm|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now we know that Zanasi likes to bid |pg||
nt|MolvaM: still there are only 8 tricks so far|pg||
nt|malipivo:  E-W preserve a diamond attack.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe declarer shld try to steal a heart trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: by playing @hJ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if he wins he can duck a club then|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or he will immediately duck the club and rely on the @s finesse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which doesnt work|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: East in Closed Room may be of the same mind|pg||
nt|minimeck: Not the worst slam in the world, trumps 3-0 sinks the boat, NS here likely playing limited openings, so south simply bid 4@s with no slam interest opposite an 11-15, many pairs ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: might use jacoby or simmilar and get to 6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason might be that 3 diamonds cannot be ruffed as spades are 3-0.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  3 imps for Poland waveing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  These symmetry hands are bridge nightmares.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: morderczy kontrakt zagrali|pg||

nt|MolvaM: hmmm defensive error|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Developing hearts is not that easy as seems.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is going to be endplayed.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: N was bidding as in their notes, now trying Exclusion for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: maybe 5d means ASK except d,and south forgot the system|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they blocked the hearts|pg||
nt|minimeck: Several pairs allready have arrived to six, one wonderful aspect of the running scores, can see each board across the field :) |pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzjy: sry,I have taken a mistake.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They were aware that hcps probably lay one-sided (1@d bid).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would be interesting to see if south was awake enough to grab the @hJ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They are after lunch, he might easily be! :)|pg||

nt|poohbear: I think the Italians outbid the Aussies here. 3NT looks like a better spot. But breaks are normal so 4@h should make too|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|malipivo:  good day, welcome!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now bernard waits patiently again to get his @sK|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  the 98 of clubs make this hand very easy. Making 10 tricks for a flat board.  But there is the question of the best way to play hearts to guard against a 4-1 break|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but he might try to endplay East for -2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Overtaking?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defense is cooperating, even low and a spade return works for time being.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Or overtaking and a spade return with overruffing potential.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *diamond return|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But club return is also a nice option. :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ryskiel_: rêka 4-4-4-1 jest zawsze nieprzyjemna jak rozgrywa przeciwnik|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Hm, no ducking is the club suit?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|poohbear: straight guess I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: depends what you think the distributions are|pg||
nt|poohbear: can play either hand for short hearts|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Andy is now going through that thought process.|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: need to hook the @h10 here to make|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: defense can make 1@c, 2@h, 1@D, 1@s and a @c ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: for 1 down|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so good lead|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  There's a swing in the bidding here. Edgtton (and Hung) partnership style doesn't rate the west hand as a 2NT overcall (lowest two unbid suits, 5/5).|pg||
nt|sliynk: the word from the people here is if standings stay as they are it will be most likely NED v SING - France v China - Isreal v Italy - AUS v USA with AUS and Isreal in the same half ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We see fast four losers (@s, @h! 2x@c).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south opens spades but no wasted points there against the singleton|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's test if West is not sleeping? a low diamond to @d9, but it is easy for West to cover @d6.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  even now|pg||

nt|malipivo:  How would you like to be in 6@h contract?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: NS lead 3rd from even and low from odd|pg||
pc|c8|nt|MolvaM: looks to be on the right track|pg||

nt|malipivo:  To be in heart slam is a bad idea missing @hAQ.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|keylime:  Very good bidding. Now, will another trump lead come from West?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  (I was thinking 6@d at first glance.)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would have been happy if I reached that but unless both reds divide 3-2 I would be in trouble|pg||
nt|MolvaM: esp after a club lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|johnjones:  Declarer can now afford to duck a spade for communication.  That wouldn't have been possible on  a trump lead.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer will need to be in the moment here and play carefully for the slam. It's easy to let excitement as a well bid hand get to best of you.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  This will be the first swing in the match that doesn't involve undertricks or overtricks|pg||

nt|dburn: ...as he should have done - how would he beat the contract if declarer had @hA?...|pg||

nt|MolvaM: nice 4@h here|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h pass 4@h or?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 7: North tried his best according to known information.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right. it helped when south passed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: actually I would also open that south hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on board 7|pg||
nt|poohbear: Israel has 4 boards to pick up about 16 imps to win the RR|pg||
mb|1D|nt|uni_dennis: bd 10 also @h lead in the open room|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: v Lankveld also played the 9, so will be another push|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: what will west open? i think 2@s, but some would open 4@s or 3@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Precisely defended, well done!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: a rather easy 3NT now with @d 2-2|pg||
nt|minimeck: On a closer look, 6@s is certainly makable, might need the heart lead to give it problems|pg||
mb|2S|nt|malipivo:  I believed that hearts would be developed.|pg||

nt|minimeck: along with the 3-0 spades|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR is going down soon.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: lets see if they reach 3nt or 4@h here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Denmark and Singapore running head to head . Denmark leads by .5 VP for the last spot|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Well, they got to a slamland, but they are going back.|pg||
nt|minimeck: back to our multi auctions|pg||

nt|minimeck: Multi certainly can prove destructive to the opps, very tough to sort out some hands like these even with the prepared defenses, delle cave with a very wise choice|pg||
nt|malipivo:  11-imp swing for Bulgaria.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The OR is finishing their 1@s making, hm.|pg||
nt|dburn: tricky, this - but South has done well; North ought to raise him|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: Hello|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As we can see, Argentina is playing equal bridge to these teams (USA2, now France).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is pleasing information.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Kids please don't listen right now: I am psyching with 0+ hcp from time to time, I would also try something.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@s is natural 8-11 with 5-6 @s|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @d lead should damage 2NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But it must be in hearts, in spade grand we don't have enough winners in hearts for discards.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jest 3 BA|pg||
nt|tez: 2nt invitational @h|pg||
nt|malipivo:  (social bridge)|pg||
nt|poohbear: So whoever wins the Round Robin gets to chose it's opponent for the next match from teams 5-8. We suspect there will be carry over based on the RR match played head to head. secon|pg||
pc|s6|nt|keylime:  East has a tricky rebid here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  North didn't and East was ruffing.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: aha, bo tam malopolska szkola strefy :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie- grano 3 bez jednej|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@c a transfer to 2@D, to play there or any INV|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so wackwitz needs to do more than 2@D if he doesn't want to play there|pg||
nt|minimeck: the pre-empter would typically take one bid unless he has a suprise, which here he does, as 3nt looks a likely make won't be too bad here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Second team then picks from the remaining 3 teams and so on|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulczynek: Najwiêksz¹ zagadk¹ tych mistrzostw jest dla mnie decyzja trenera Holandii, ¿eby graæ bez zmian. Ta sama czwórka gra ju¿ siódmy mecz. Dziêki temu maj¹ 42 VPy przewagi nad pi¹tym ...|pg||
nt|gulczynek: miejscem, ale nie wiem po co im ona.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: tak tak, jest juz protokol|pg||
pc|c8|nt|keylime:  2@d would be fourth suit forcing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A risky 6@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They would need a swing of this magnitude.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hi konstatinos|pg||
nt|cicus: W has a nice hand for @Hs so he has to do something other than lazily raising to 4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have some options on this deal: finessing @cK or squeezing South in minor suits.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@h will probably make but declarer will have to work hard|pg||
nt|sliynk: 1/2 if you won the match and 1/3 if you lost it capped at 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|poohbear: There will be straight KOs starting at the round of 8|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|johnjones:  We are seeing good judgement and nice card play from 4 youngsters whose combined aged is 62 (younger than many of us).|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ryskiel_: operatorzy wprawiaj¹ mnie w stan jaki Hannibal prze¿ywa³ przed botw¹ pod Kannami:(|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2NT is an overbid, 1 is enough|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: z takimi pikami sie dalismy przelicytowac, no ladnie :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: * i guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after a club lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|johnjones:  Good lead, best declarer can do is -150|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Andy has embarrassment of riches|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sJxx is providing a safety trick for declarer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  An opportunity for Chinese team.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other leads are more friendly to declarer|pg||
nt|sliynk: 4 x 14 boards|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: westerbeek looking for his best bid: 3@h can be 5, 3@s can be 3, 3N needs better stopper|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good start for the def|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He may try to cash @hA first.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: france, as expected, gets 10 more from board 8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As a part of safety plan.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|keylime:  Very good lead. Declarer does not have that friendly of splits here, and cards are not well placed either.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  3NT is also an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sort of auctions there's not a lot of point leading @s as partner didn't raise and RHO surely has a robust stopper|pg||
nt|z_lasu: jakies miliony stoja|pg||

nt|malipivo:  They have crossed 42-imp difference barried and we are getting to 25-5 VPs zone.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *barrier|pg||
pc|c2|nt|keylime:  Probably a result of the slam; the need to bid a close game to get imps back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3rd and 5th leads, also against notrump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: n  missing, my fault  Konstantinos|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: ranges in natural bidding made this a tough hand to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in strong @c after 1@c E has a GF hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think 3C was better than 3d|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: So Micke knows partner has 5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And that squeeze can be blocked leading diamonds.|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder if E knows about @SK|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|uni_dennis: will lose 3@c and 3@s, so 2 off|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: meyuchas passed with this West hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  hm, that's pity|pg||
nt|cicus: apparently not, else he'd have alreay bid 7|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we can see that even 7!n is on, but we are taking an advantage of seeing all hands|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results and running scores for all three series here:|pg||
nt|cicus: E can count 13 tricks if he knows about @SK, @HAK and @DA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  All three series are playing the same boards, we may compare their results afterwards easily.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe a prob if hearts 3-0 but no need to be too paranoid|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Does anyone know what the Aussies were penalised VPs for? Probably slow play.  This year was the first time ever in our Junior Team Selection we had to threaten them with VP fines for slow play.  An indication of how serious they are taking|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats only good if there is no slam :P|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  the whole affair|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gronkvist:  Bye all have to go|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, it is pity|pg||
nt|MolvaM: what to discard?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cicus: if 5@D showed 3 aces then 5NT was an invitation to grand and @SK should suffice|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  All cards sit well for him.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: to accept|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and free finesse, but nice singleton lead|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: trzeciego trefla jak przebije 9-k¹ to faktycznie mo¿e byæ spora progresja|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: defence might go astray here if south plays north for a stiff @SJ|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Thx Johan|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer is going to get squeezed here possibly.|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime:  I can understand if red. |pg||
nt|keylime:  but at equal white, makes no sense.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Thanks Johan!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner can't bid over 1NT, you have not missed a game|pg||
nt|mrdct: as nabil might settle for 2 off|pg||

pc|d4|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Youngsters, Poland vs England, at the moment winning 25-4 VPs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 10, they didn't cash those fast winners, so contract made and a major swing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks like.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: an drugim stole nie padla kontra na 2@s...|pg||

nt|malipivo:  May I say it? :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 24 hcp 3NT coming it seems|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Australia and Italy are also currently qualifying for the Quarter Finals in the Youngsters category. A good sign for the future prospects of both countries at Junior level, once the current players become too old.|pg||
nt|sliynk: we lost 2 vps for a phone fine and lost some vps for slow play against denmark in the last match|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: tough now - S will have to pass and N?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Permission granted|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Mozart's music for my ears.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Slam is on, dear spectators!|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3@h here a popular treatment, showing 3 spades, singleton heart, and 4/5 either way in the minors, GF|pg||
nt|minimeck: the same bid also exists for 3@s (1-3(4/5))|pg||
nt|minimeck: if partner chooses a minor, you can then bid rkc (kickback) if he bids 3nt, then you can simply bid 4nt or in this case 6nt, or bid gerber|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: in open room bd 11 NS were having a misunderstanding in the bidding, as N passed 2@c |pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n from South would be reasonable now.|pg||
nt|cicus: not on a 5 count|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, that's true|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am too on double dummy.|pg||
nt|cicus: N had an option to bid 2NT right away though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@h opener might let them make 1NT on a @h lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is sort of endplayed at first trick.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Nasty Andy. Semi psych picking off Zanasi's suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|keylime:  N/S got very high here and paid handsomely.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is cold here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now dealer is testing their bidding to 4@s.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: very disciplined|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I am impressed|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but East is to the rescue with DBL|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I thought west could find reasons to bid 3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good spots|pg||
nt|MolvaM: two 8 spots and a 9 :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no deuce|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems to make actually|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: depends on what you mean by "opportunity" - against 6@d, West would have had the opportunity to lead a low heart and get a club ruff|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: expect them to land to 3NT here will probably bid 2@s now|pg||
nt|cicus: I think he has too many losers to bid this high|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: lubie 3nt:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: DBL very agressive opposite a NV 3rd hand opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: think 2NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  reopening would be nice from North.|pg||
nt|cicus: 5 losers - partner will raise 4@D with 3 tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but better than all other sorts of 10/11 counts with his QJTx in both @s and @C|pg||
nt|minimeck: Here Siderov chooses to show his 5cd minor and continue in a forcing auction|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Indeed, this treatment is working nicely on this deal.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|keylime:  W/E have an incredibly lucky minor position being 3-3.|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: need to find the @C ruff to win the board here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT would be off on a @s lead, but 2NT can be made if declarer gets 4@d tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  two tens are helping|pg||
nt|cicus: even 4@D is a stretch when partner could not act over 3@H|pg||

nt|MolvaM: nice lead to start with|pg||
nt|poohbear: Zanasi shows close to a 2NT opener for this sequence so DiFranco has an easy 3NT bid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: oh, I see - 5@d was played by North, and East led a club anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I must admit I am not that disciplined (among other things), but I would respond 1@d as I would like to know more about partner's hand.|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I'm a bit surprised he didn't bid 1S if he was going to semi-psych ... given that it's more preemptive.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hung got his partner off to a good lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 11, they are in 3@dS.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|malipivo:  yes, exactly|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and here comes a spade ruff|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Indeed.  He clearly knows more than I do :p|pg||
nt|poohbear: @s lead works as well|pg||
nt|poohbear: Singapore winning max and now has a comfortable lead over Denmark|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the last spot|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hung will need to know to shift to @cs and not @ss when in with the @h king|pg||
nt|poohbear: so nothing clear at the moment on this hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Would overtaking @dT with @dJ help defense?|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes|pg||
nt|poohbear: because then if declarer ducks Hung can shift to a @s and get a Negative signal|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  The card Nabil plays when declarer takes the H finesse should be suit preference between C and S ...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mrdct: entry to east is gone now|pg||

pc|c2|nt|uni_dennis: bd 11 N playing 2@dX|pg||

nt|lukasz1982: zobaczymy jak umiejetnosci:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even if he had a 4card major|pg||
pc|dA|nt|keylime:  The overtrick here may matter. |pg||
nt|dburn: so West could find the heroic underlead to beat five|pg||
nt|garden2005: teraz widaæ, ¿e nie jest warto otwieraæ z trzeciej rêki 4@h|pg||

nt|mrdct: huge board for the aussies|pg||
nt|hackenbush: the interference made it tough for the big clubbers|pg||

nt|keylime:  Difference between 90 and 120 points I think tho is in the same range for imps. Someone check that for me please.|pg||
nt|osvaill83: sorry all.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I think the cutoff is 80 points for 2 imps.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: big swing - match over?|pg||
nt|tez: why not @d disc?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I see.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer needs to play a @c to kill the communications|pg||

nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing last deal.|pg||
nt|garden2005: jest drobna szansa :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: teraz|pg||
nt|poohbear: and get a squeeze going against East|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h5|nt|gruffydd:  Oh yes. Declarer has only one entry to table for the pade finesse. A club exit will, indeed, squeeze Hung in the majors.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: can make 3N actually, N has no entry for another @s return|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and endplay on the way|pg||
nt|cicus: well spotted|pg||
nt|malipivo:  thank you :)|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: ech|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i tak mo¿na i tak mo¿na|pg||
nt|poohbear: And if West doesnt cash the @cs then declarer makes by force|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Remarably similar to a hand I played against Nabil and Andy back in the 2008 Australian Junior event.  Except I didn't get it right :/|pg||
nt|poohbear: everything depends on what he thinks about the bidding and the defense. West's @c play showed panic so not likely to be looking at the major kings|pg||
pc|cT|nt|malipivo:  Declarer is afraid of heart position.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He is kind of forced to play hearts otherwise he would be endplayed in hand.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  in hearts|pg||
nt|poohbear: NICE PLAY!!!|pg||
nt|poohbear: Bulletin hand !|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Very well played!!!|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  No kidding|pg||
nt|sliynk: NED win round robin unless isreal win 14 on last hand but seems semi normal game|pg||
nt|poohbear: Netherland can still lose imps and allow Israel to sneak in|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Edgtton is busy figuring out that he's in trouble. He does best to cash one club and exit a spade, I think, given that Zanasi has pitched a spade from dummy.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|uni_dennis: and 2 down this is, so 5 imps and almost a tie|pg||

nt|bebechira: or 1st has some king of choice?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: nr 1 chooses from 5 to 8|pg||
nt|MolvaM: open north hand tez?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Nice job!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But they may lose imps as 6!n is also on.|pg||
nt|minimeck: might lose 2 imps would imagine most pairs will get to 6nt  :p indeed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: board 9 lafont played 3nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and stole a heart trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but he continued hearts instead of ducking a club. and went down|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that was a missed opportunity for france|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mrdct: i need to head off shortly to as it's about a 10 minute walk to the venue which i think will be a pretty happy score-up|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, hearts are tricky for such a contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: kind of choice :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, they were high but not high enought :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: must be the multi|pg||
nt|poohbear: ty :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|malipivo:  They were down in 5@d and 6@d, so it is strange way of calling it an opportunity (to bid slam).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no overcall from east with 5-5?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rigas_karo: Running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: bd 12 israel in 3NT|pg||
nt|tez: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is in 4@s after 2@s-p-4@s-all pass.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe it was an opportunity to display superb judgement by stopping in 5@d by South or 4@d by North|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I see slams everywhere, I am sorry about that.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a low to @hT and spades back|pg||
nt|tez: you?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no way to get in now|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A contract in spades shall be easy.|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  of course!|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dynamiczne rozdanie|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4 bA|pg||
nt|cicus: I can see clearly that this is making|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And it is working well here.|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h=5 card @s and 5 minor|pg||
nt|tez: if he has minor would bid 2 nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: unsafely, you can always bid 3 hearts :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: another big result in OR|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@c or 5@d has no play potential, so likely 2!n-pass|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *playing|pg||
nt|malipivo:  or 3@d, we shall see soon enough|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Quite close slam, but it is not there.|pg||
nt|cicus: a speculative double now?|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: Mowia mi tu ze jest jakis blad w 8 rozdaniu i jest 62:25, ale to dalej koszykowka :)|pg||

nt|MolvaM: with effectively 10 hcp's|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the multi did its work|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer in 4@h will be in a lot of troubles.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so only a double and a diamond lead needed now|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a diamond to ruff, a heart, a diamond to ruff, ...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|malipivo:  And now a battle for overtricks.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 club is not a very profitable save. goes -500 and might also be 800 if declarer loses control|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ahh yes the shapely hand cannot contain his excitement|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south could have a variety of hands. so north was supposed to pass|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but france is on a roll|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: bye all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: bye Dave|pg||
nt|dburn: will have to revise my appraisal - East-West can almost make a slam here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this will make, just losing 1@h, 2@c and 1 or 2 trumps|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: won't go wrong in @s |pg||
nt|tez: ''minors''|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I saw 4@h as -3.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i can't redeal the 14th|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3 major N-S has a great potential|pg||
nt|z_lasu: E w pierwszym ruchu spasowala, a jak doszlo do niej 3pik to powiedziala 3ba|pg||
pc|s3|nt|malipivo:  sure, after a non-spade lead :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: czy to prawda, ¿e 4@s?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s bid is a testament toHung's "solid " overcalls and his declarer play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  I am kidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: they can also make a couple of overtricks in 3NT redoubled, which scores more than a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, that's a missed opportunity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@sX would be -3, I guess|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It cannot be more as we see a fast loser in every suit.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hm, declarer is missing entries, he might go down. :(|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Entries are crucial for repeated finesse in spades.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|malipivo:  or more likely 4@hX|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so this time a few imps to the Netherlands|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer has to work hard|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can make it if he guesses the stiff trump king|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite clear why South decided to double 3NT - I can understand why he might double 6NT, but below that...|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: another small pick up here maybe|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: yes looks like a small pickup|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: slam here again|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with @hQx with East and @sK in West 12 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  vugraph operator is playing differently from players, just kidding, 3@S=|pg||
nt|z_lasu: slabe rozdanie ale duza strata sie nie zapowiada|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i don't really understand 2@c by N in OR|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He is the man at our table at that deal.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok no more predictions :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The actual way was probably a heart to ruff and a club towards !K or a low club. It is hard to say.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the hand went between -2 and making and ended up -1 which was what it should be|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: with 6hcp you are happy to pass 1NT|pg||
nt|tez: no defencive error..wd|pg||

nt|poohbear: Hung did well to guess to lead a small @c from dummy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|malipivo:  4@h and defence can think about 4@s doubled|pg||
nt|cicus: good partscore for China in OR|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@D weak-2, again only having 5 and a lousy hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice distributionla hand|pg||

nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The slam has its chances with a non-spade lead, but defense prevails them in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if somenoe goes for -1100 all the more interesting for kibitzers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@c?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@h?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@d?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I have rejected a slam for with a great level of confidence. :)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|malipivo:  this is also a way|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: so you don't want to be in this slam|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west will like this rebid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzjy: SOUTH didnit see his hands|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see merit in 1@S|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this might make though, if defense plays @S early|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: dwie siedemnastki w jednej randce rzadko siê zdarzaj¹|pg||

nt|tez: good 12 point|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Axxxx is good against a splinter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I would personally go for 4@c or 4@h with 6-4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  well, a risk of club lead is obvious|pg||
nt|MolvaM: agree|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c shows a max raise to 2@h . Drury convention|pg||
pc|d4|nt|keylime:  One of the specs reports it's 20-12 if the score holds.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Correction 20-12.|pg||
nt|keylime:  20-10|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but getting to East hand for a club ruff is difficult|pg||
nt|malipivo:  some people treat xxxxx as four card suit|pg||
nt|tez: nearly 5@c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We could see a similar situation yesterday, a bidding side is missing AK in one suit.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and bid 4@d with 5-4 hands but thats me|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on the way to a losing slam|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tez: part score swing|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would prefer to be in 6@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It would have its chances, leading from Axx or Kxx is no beauty for defense.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theoretical 6@d, clubs would get a chance to be developed.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|z_lasu: miejmy nadzieje ze nie zagra na singlowego za|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: znowu kompyter siê zestarza³?|pg||

nt|cicus: but when you are relatively weak, raising partner is most important|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@h E-W is making as far as I can see|pg||
pc|d2|nt|uni_dennis: 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: Looks like a very flat board|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, it is|pg||
nt|tez: zanasi why not 1@h?may be pd has 4card @h..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zanasi worried abt suit quality obviously|pg||
nt|tez: ginuus:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but 1@s was wrong|pg||
pc|dK|nt|uni_dennis: 2@s on bd 13 was a(nother) push|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: unless ofcourse South decides to get creative and opens with his 11 count|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: van Lankveld did open 1@h, van den Bos now relaying the hand|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: so this could be a possible swing for Netherlands|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Some good declarer play this match.  Australia a certain 3rd in the RR now, and Italy set for 7th.  Just pride to play for in this match now.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West didn't get chance declarer to misguess hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  esp. with Txx.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He is just missing @hT.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|malipivo:  If West would be void in spades, that would be a nice story.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@h was ok but west was impressed with his void and having all keycards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can he still make it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: with single @hQ and @h9 well placed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I dont think sor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I am aware that GIB says the hand is makable|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If he doesn't touch hearts at all, maybe there's a chance.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north double of 5@d was unnecessary by the way|pg||
pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: he was telling himself what to lead|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|MolvaM: this is a fundamental mistake. might lose a heart fit if existed. but no problem this hand|pg||
nt|tez: they will take @h ruff|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|malipivo:  2 imps flowing to Poland for not being doubled.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: but critical for singapore (9th) just 1 vp behind denmark|pg||
nt|tez: lucky 6@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: here is a slam on 2 finesses :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks it is not as clubs were protected.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We haven't seen a 3!n contract today, that's little strange.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kib tells me tha3@d would have been a splinter too|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  That might be a swing to France.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 25% chance but today it works|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: wackwitz played it with Drijver last year|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|johnjones:  back to another well played push board|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 13 top tricks here in @h, @c and NT|pg||
nt|cicus: it is not clear how NS can come to 11 tricks in spades here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@d = 4+@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@d is?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@c?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: diamond support and invitational?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It seems so, otherwise 2@c is in view.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt makes thanks to 4-3 spades|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Edgtton thinks the West hand is too good for a mini-NT perhaps?  I would have wielded the mini|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  playing @dT has its advantage on this deal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  diamonds could provide discard for that club|pg||
nt|cicus: some of the lightest overcalls I have ever seen|pg||
nt|cicus: oh yes but you have to trump 3 clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  be happy you haven't seen mine|pg||
nt|cicus: I can live with any style|pg||
nt|malipivo:  so hearts must be it|pg||
mb|1H!|an|3|nt|keylime:  1@h is a xfer to spades here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  natural, or 12-14 / 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but the opps never leave you alone in the bidding at these colours|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@S denying 3@h|pg||
nt|tez: they play 4@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dont expect them to bid though|pg||
nt|malipivo:  (I am sorry, we did, Board 2.)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@c would go down as clubs are 5-1.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@h shld have been more distributional than a 4432|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south has stoppers everywhere but maybe interested in a slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  18-19 bal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  slam zone for E-W|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and natural|pg||

nt|cicus: oh I did not notice :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  that overtrick helped a lot in the other room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it might be another imp for China|pg||
nt|cicus: even 10 tricks are not obvious here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but we are not done here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: club finesse first and then @d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|malipivo:  and now time for defense|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 5@h asking for a @s cue|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: yes EW are doing a good job disturbing NS|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@d and 3@h natural|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2@s has its chances.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|uni_dennis: south should have shown that he has @sA, i think|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the @dA is not with spade length so no problem here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Over 1@H?|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I mean 2NT instead of 2D over 1H|pg||

nt|keylime:  The 4333 hand with great intermediates leans South into the 3NT contract on the 9 card major suit fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With a balanced hand and 4-c support they go through 2@D|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: E showing slam interest now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if he ducks twice|pg||
pc|hA|nt|johnjones:  Thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  From South's view, the hand will be slowly played, hence the lower game contract.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that is careless play|pg||

pc|h3|nt|malipivo:  I am missing @sJ and I am still unaware of spades distribution.|pg||
