mb|p|nt|kit: Keep in mind that at IMPs 4@S has to take 2 more tricks than 3NT in order to show a real profit.|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: well judged to go low here, i must say i am surprised he didn't try game some where|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult hand.  Stopping on a dime at 3@S with this sort of hand is usually wrong -- need exactly 9 tricks to make in spades, but not in notrump.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|bridgegoth: For thos wondering what we mean: 5 level protection means you can safely bid at the 5 level while making your slam tries. Therefore, unless you're sure you can always make 5, don't ...|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: make a try that takes you past 4.|pg||

nt|minimeck: Good point kit, hard to put a % on which is more likely|pg||
nt|kit: I think most players are too afraid of the 5-level, and miss a lot of good slams for fear of 5-level safety.|pg||
nt|kit: I know it looks awful when you get to 5 down 1, but a missed slam is just as expensive.|pg||
nt|minimeck: if it's 40% slam is cold, 40% you are fine in 5, and 20% you go down in 5, those aren't the worst odds|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Right, N hand is hard to judge, I think you must just trust your partner that if they had something to say, they will say it|pg||
