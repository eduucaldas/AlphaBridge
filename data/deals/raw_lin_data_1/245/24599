nt|bridgegoth: 6@H quite nice here|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: Now we should see some action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: Key for North to come in |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@d 4+@d and 4+@s weak|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1N|nt|bridgegoth: I'm bidding 2@H there... 6 card suits are made for bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: We lost the comparisons -- I believe Poland ahead by about 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|agumperz:  wow, i am surprised zach would pass|pg||
nt|kit: We dont' know what is available to him|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kit: but he does know he is probably outgunned.|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: The good double of 2@S will get South back into the auction.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|agumperz:  adam's double to show spades is a welcome surprise to Zach|pg||
nt|minimeck: 4@s to me looks like it should be a trick short without magic in the club suit. |pg||
mb|4S|nt|minimeck: thievery indeed, :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: I am doubling with the other hand|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Disaster for Israel, we will see what happens in the other room|pg||
nt|minimeck: over 2@s, double is certainly an option as well ! :p|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Jeng bid 2@H|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this time NS did find a reasonable contract to play|pg||
nt|minimeck: A@c lead might also solve that|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Well, it made in the other room|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|uni_dennis: and with friendly distribution this will make|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NS in 6@h on bd 5 in OR|pg||
nt|minimeck: I'm not making any promises, certainly, just my first view of the hand :p, I will leave it to you kit to predict|pg||
nt|kit: I agree with you -- seems like a trick short|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|minimeck: Double game swing (or slam + game) now available :p|pg||
nt|kit: Not overcalling 2@H looks pretty soft to me.|pg||
nt|kit: although it might come home if he can ruff all his clubs -- pitching a diamond if East ruffs in with 10 of spades.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|bridgegoth: Uh oh.. Jeng just Xed 4@S|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: declarer guessed well in the @h suit|pg||
nt|kit: But I don't think he has the entries for that|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bridgegoth: could be a swing the other way|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|agumperz:  if spades had been 2-1 the contract would be cold|pg||
pc|h8|nt|minimeck: In all haste, they have allowed this contract to make by not setting up the rough |pg||
pc|h4|nt|minimeck: still should be a good board|pg||
nt|poohbear: Partner shouldnt sit 4@s x|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: other Jeng in the tank|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so a big +1430 for the Netherlands there|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bridgegoth: pulled to 5@H|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s2|nt|bridgegoth: X|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, certainly always cold on 2-1 spades|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: Now I don't see how he has a chance|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bridgegoth: 5@Hx final contract|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|minimeck: 17 imps it seems|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: That's 1050 if you're scoring at home, so looking like 17|pg||
nt|kit: So we are headed for double game swing|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|sJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|minimeck: Unfortunately we lost the play in the open room, cannot see what happened. |pg||

nt|kit: As we have seen so often, it is a bidder's game.|pg||
nt|kit: So Poland increases its lead (it is about 12 IMPs more than the score says)|pg||
nt|minimeck: I am told the other table began with the ace of clubs, that explains it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridgegoth: I think passing either one of those N/S hands is criminal|pg||
nt|kit: Which West demonstrates with this opening bid.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 3NT looking good by S|pg||
nt|kit: Now this is more like it -- 3 bids and the South hand still to come.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  according to GIB the contract is cold after the heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: won't get away with this one|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and nowhere to run|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This 3@H call is really overdoing it IMO|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: running score juniors:|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qtournid=922&qphase=SF|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bridgegoth: Time for a red card perhaps|pg||
nt|agumperz:  he just needed to start ruffing clubs immediately when he crossed to dummy with spade ace|pg||
nt|minimeck: The gib button can be fun to use as a spectator, but if i started clicking that to make predictions, it would lead to rediculous comments :) |pg||
pc|h3|nt|minimeck: It's one thing to open light, but over a single raise, 3@h is simply, i want to take another bid because I feel like it :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT the winner, but far from obvious|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: official website: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridgegoth: That's how to go for 1100-101 to me|pg||
nt|minimeck: This looks a quick 140 |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|kit: The problem with bidding 3@H isn't so much the possible -1100, but the bid just doesn't appear to me to have any upside.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|minimeck: but very well might just continue hearts|pg||
nt|kit: I never use it while commentating -- it is important to realize what the players are seeing, not what works double-dummy.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bridgegoth: Right, it does'nt take up space, or anything|pg||
nt|minimeck: another possible swing here, east must trust partner's spades and hope diamonds aren't running, might be a layout where partner has ace and a heart, however|pg||
nt|minimeck: seems logical to just continue|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer in trouble here with king of diamonds offside|pg||
nt|agumperz:  For a player-like view of the action: Click Options->More Options->Advanced Options->Kibitz one hand|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe should have ducked first spade.  It would have been difficult for East to find a heart shift.|pg||
nt|kit: Seems right for West to sacrifce a spade trick to declarer to make sure declarer can't use the diamonds.|pg||
nt|minimeck: West here might be worried about setting up the ninth trick, seems he will have to simply push his spades and pray, can't see how the queen of hearts can be right here, but perhaps ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: it might in some scenarios|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i think he can still make as long as he wins the first heart|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|c9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: If anything it makes life easier for the opponents, since North can pass if she doesn't have a clear call.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|bridgegoth: A bid should to one of 3 things... suggest a lead, show strength, or take up space, 3@H does none of those|pg||
nt|kit: So it looks like yet another game swing to Poland|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|agumperz:  not now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|minimeck: I have to say, it is refreshing to see the players taking a long time to make these decisions, where frequently they would simply blast the spades without thought|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|bridgegoth: I agree, 140 might not be a bad result, but with all the E/W bidding, it made 3NT more of a possibility|pg||
nt|agumperz:  2@H?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Since they use multi|pg||
nt|kit: This is like a Precision 2@D I imagine|pg||
nt|minimeck: they use 2@h as their precision 3 suiter short diamodns|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: S might have decided to take a plunge to 3NT with Kx@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: Presumably South can ask and find shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: Quite a gem here as well |pg||
nt|kit: Not what West wanted to hear|pg||
nt|minimeck: Presumably north will try 3@h now|pg||
nt|kit: This is probably pass or correct -- but East might bid more as he has a good hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 1NT 15-17, but will S believe him?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i think bidding 2@c first is the way to show a 5card M for NS|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|bridgegoth: Hopefully North does not decide to violate one of BridgeGoth's Laws here|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H by North here would be truly awful|pg||
nt|minimeck: in this situation, when opps are in 4 of a minor, usually you sit content|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bridgegoth: 4@C is Gerber, therefore 4@D must be Derber, if you're opponents want to play Gerber or Derber, LET THEM!|pg||
nt|minimeck: :)|pg||
nt|kit: If you are going to do that, you should just open 4@H and let opponents guess at high level.|pg||
nt|kit: But South chose to ignore possible 4-4 heart fit.  I don't like that decision.  For all he knew, North might have been 3-4-1-5.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|minimeck: on some days nt on an "expected" diamond lead might be the spot, this is not one of them|pg||
pc|dT|nt|uni_dennis: not sure who is playing 4@S now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridgegoth: Trump lead might be a great start|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: then this shows 5card @s and N converts to 4@s with 3card support|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: Great for declarer, that is|pg||
nt|poohbear: or not. Draw trumps set up @ds|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: :)|pg||
nt|kit: West will duck the second spade, and it will be another game swing|pg||
nt|kit: oh my a reprive|pg||
nt|minimeck: Couldn't resist the temptation to play a diamond there :p|pg||
nt|kit: I have a rule -- when partner leads a suit vs NT and I win the 10, that usually means something good has happened in the suit.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|uni_dennis: good thing for NS is that you won't make 3NT either|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|kit: On a heart lead, I don't see how declarer could take 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: Fortunately declarer can survive this, as if West continues spades he will have 1 spade, 4 hearts, 3 club, 1 diamond|pg||
nt|kit: But if West underleads AK of spades again, declarer might go wrong.|pg||
nt|minimeck: do you think a tank low spade might give a slight indication here?|pg||
nt|kit: Although he shouldn't, since only chance to make hand is West has AK of spades.|pg||
nt|kit: Defense does have 5 top tricks, but West doesn't know that.|pg||
nt|minimeck: good point :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Kazmiercza has defended quite well thus far, another big chance. |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|kit: ok, he could -- but he wouldn't.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I meant about the 7@D play|pg||
nt|minimeck: Now it seems he will figure it out|pg||
nt|kit: Now West can't blow it|pg||
nt|minimeck: He knows clubs and hearts will be good, will need part to have A@d|pg||

nt|minimeck: imo|pg||
nt|kit: maybe with stiff spade auction doesn't scream for trump lead|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@s will not make|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: defense can take 2@d and a @d ruff and then 3 more @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: Declarer simply could not believe that he underlead qj, but seems risk free|pg||
nt|minimeck: Looks like they squeezed east in 3nt here, after a heart lead continued a heart right away , the "double" finese would also work :p|pg||
nt|kit: On heart lead will test diamonds, and when they are bad need double club finesse -- which works.|pg||
nt|minimeck: My initial thoughts were correct, west is indeed a "he" http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/?p=21&pid=10570|pg||
pc|h7|nt|poohbear: true|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|kit: Hmm -- that is a nice line of play -- coming back a heart|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|minimeck: Figuring perhaps that if west had 6@h AK might have bid over 2nt, certainly worked well here|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: they do play standard suit-preference, in case anybody is wondering.|pg||
