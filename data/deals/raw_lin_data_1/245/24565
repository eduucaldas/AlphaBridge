nt|kit: I know it looks awful when you get to 5 down 1, but a missed slam is just as expensive.|pg||
nt|minimeck: if it's 40% slam is cold, 40% you are fine in 5, and 20% you go down in 5, those aren't the worst odds|pg||

mb|1H|nt|bridgegoth: I agree, 140 might not be a bad result, but with all the E/W bidding, it made 3NT more of a possibility|pg||
