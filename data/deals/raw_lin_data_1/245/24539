mb|1N|nt|andyv:  a lot of jumping on this hand...S has an easy 4@h bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can bid 4@s and N will compete to 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: hi again|pg||
mb|2C|nt|malipivo:  4-card side suit in North is useful on this deal.|pg||

mb|p|nt|toniemme: Ciao a tutti e benvenuti all'incontro Italia Francia ragazze che inaugura il girone di ritorno..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h looks like -1|pg||

nt|the_clown:  good morning|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  hi Michael and Yordan|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least he prevents the over trick|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Both tables landed in 1!nN.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: this is the last round of the Round Robin|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  *lose, I am sorry|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 2@h 3@d 1@c and 2@s as i can see|pg||

nt|malipivo:  We are watching Juniors, players are aged 25 or younger.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|toniemme: giustamente sud non copre..:):)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A higher level of !n would need to be played from South's hand.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But should go down on a spade lead.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Our first swing today is coming.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h8|pc|d7|nt|uni_dennis: i was even in doubt whether you should bid at all with N hand opposite 15-17 NT|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer will shorten East's trump soon via clubs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And now finessing all cards against South.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and overtrick comes back with dividends|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: he will make by ruffing some @ds|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|malipivo:  I must admit that I am kibitzing third match with Argentina in it and I am already a fan of their team.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but i think you should as partner may hold 4@s and then 4@s can be good|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: difficult decision now for wackwitz|pg||
pc|cA|nt|uni_dennis: knows declarer has 1@c 3@d tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so cashing @cs only needed if S had 5 tricks in the Majors|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cc469: probably not :)|pg||
nt|the_clown:  even 2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is playing 2@sE|pg||
nt|toniemme: strana scelta di ovest che probabilmente ha "letto" le picchje 43 in mano avversa|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but declarer can easily hold !Q here as well, @s Qxx @h AQx @d AKx @C QTx, as Wackwitz doesn't know about min/max|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hmm.. declarer then missing a card.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if E gave count in @d, W knows S hold 4@Cs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: now it makes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|malipivo:  East is enjoying a game of bridge at the moment very much.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so W needed to play @h after 2nd @c|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: then declarer cannot take 3@s tricks, because he needs to enter dummy first with a @S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|malipivo:  Well, maybe not that much as he is thinking about club singleton in South's hand.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: declarer might worry that W has the @hK or @hQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if he tries @s then might lose 2 more tricks in the Ms|pg||
pc|s4|nt|toniemme: ora sud è in grado di mantenere l'impegno ottenendo la nona presa con il fante di @H|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is going to be endplayed.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in OR EW were allowed to play 4@s, but 1 off|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|malipivo:  The reason is that he is longer in trumps than East, oh!|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||

nt|malipivo:  I am also crossing fingers to Netherlands as Ms. Ticha, a Czech player, is playing there.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d may have been a stretch but the double by W is hard one to believe since he can't see too many defensive tricks...almost feel like he meant it as responsive|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so with +120 from OR makes 5 imps|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|frankaus: bulgaria needs a good day to makr Rof8|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but 5@c made, so 8 imps to denmark|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defense could set up spades earlier esp. after a spade discard from South's hand. Never mind.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|malipivo:  So play was different than we saw. :( It happens.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Our first push board is coming.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: looks like the tables aren't connected|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I see slams everywhere and this shall be the case.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|toniemme: nord dovrebbe licitare 1@H e sud replicare 1@S (nord potrebbe avere 44 nobile e in qualche raro caso 33 nobile)..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  First imps to Argentina.|pg||
nt|the_clown:  unless they play very convervative preempts in second seat, double is very strange|pg||
nt|toniemme: la distribuzione salva una linea di gioco non propri ortodossa...dovrebbe comunque essere mano pari..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so we might get a restart on of of the tables|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2NT = INV or bad GF, with 3+ fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  6@s would work well as repeated finesse in clubs against @cQ is on.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: declarer in 4@S took a very wrong line|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But the slam is risky, so let's expect 4th or 5th level here.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@c GF asking 3/4 card and min/max|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@s 4(+)@s and min. if they play it as Wackwitz and me do|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I will explain, it is happening at this tournament:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If N-S gets to a slam, it looks it is there.|pg||
nt|cc469: reasonable contract but down on a @H lead|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|kiwibridge: welcome back I'll repeat the live scoring site http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A small mistake by vugraph operator leads to a different line.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 3NT serious slam try|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: OR bid and made 6@s|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|malipivo:  Yes, very true spectators, we saw a line where declarer had to be endplayed, not his opponent.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6 imps to Bulgaria as the other room played 4@h=.|pg||
nt|andyv:  good bid as it rates to go down only 2|pg||
nt|toniemme: 3@S mostra una 54 di 13 15..|pg||
nt|toniemme: talvolta 4441..:):)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT asking for shortness maybe|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@c denying short suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Accurate defense in a diamond sacrifice may lose fast 7 tricks.|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|malipivo:  Leading a diamond is difficult for South.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: over 3@s opener can ask for shortness with next bid (3NT) or bid shortness himself (4@c, 4@D, 4@h)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: dalle prime due licite parrebbe chiaro che a Sud piaccia "decidere" i boards in fase licitativa...fortuna vuole che il compagno non abbia 8 o 9 punti..cosa del tutto possibile|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1NT in OR|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: we have 2 top junior pairs playing here|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|xenya: @S switch needed here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, welcome to the slamland N-S!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other table is in 5@sN, so a swing is coming one or the other way.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so i think westerbeek should have bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  5@h can be made as the Ace of @h is stiff and declarer should be able to work out the club situation (E will run out of space to hold too many clubs)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is not forced to try finesse right now.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He may play an ace and get more information about distribution.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is also a potential squeeze in minor suits against West, if East would play @dK on the first round.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|uni_dennis: 4@d cuebid, 4@h last train|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: Lebatteux-Kilani have won the European Junior Pairs Championships last month|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|malipivo:  Another swing is coming as other table is playing 6@sS.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|snigill: these teams are now number 4 and 5 when 2 days are left of the round robin|pg||
nt|copeyj: This auction was surprising - I would have thought if you chose to bid stayman with L'Huissier's hand you would follow it by bidding 2@H over 2@D to offer partner a choice of ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: another coin flip slam actually, although you might get a @c lead on this one ending all the problems|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|frankaus: last hand reminds me of a "ditti" - Q.  what do u lead from QJxx  ... A.... another suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  North is enjoying a game of bridge very much at the moment.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: not with these @Ds in S though|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|uni_dennis: Bilde -Jepsen were on the team that won the Juniors World Championship in 2008|pg||
pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  from spec: 6 @S only goes down with @S lead|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I have missed first tricks as typing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is an opportunity for Argentina, they are still bidding.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is thin slam, but which aren't?|pg||

nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, 5@h can go down with a @c lead by W but not sure why W would lead a club|pg||
pc|sK|nt|uni_dennis: needs to get @s right in the end|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|jafa: even without a club lead, there is too much to do|pg||
nt|toniemme: 9 prese per est ..|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but as kibs say, lack of @d continuation suggests @SA in N|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: is there a good reason not to take the @c finesse?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: can't see one, so will make|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|copeyj: down 3 is obtainable by drawing trumps - I think I would have rather played @DQ on second round of the suit from North but this is fine|pg||

nt|malipivo:  They avoided it: 3!nS.|pg||
nt|snigill: a decent hand south has got there|pg||
nt|copeyj: possible 4@S here for N/S - we have all been in worse contracts but with @C 5-1 and trumps 4-1 this doesn't seem to stand much chance|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: wild bidding in OR here, EW ending in 6@h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT +1 in OR|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: we'll check that score for you|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: 1@S=0-4 @S F1R|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: after N opened 3@c|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|kiwibridge: 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is probably considering reopening.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h looks as a make.|pg||
nt|jafa: Important match for both teams, Denmark currently occupy the last qualifying spot (8th) while Australia are in 2nd and within striking distance of the leaders|pg||
nt|andyv:  you hate to sell out, but wrong vul|pg||
nt|the_clown:  I guess 2N is invit+ with 4 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  This is going to be a match to be remembered!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: Declarer thinking a lot.|pg||
nt|copeyj: if that is the case then 2@C shows @S/@C 11-15 or any hand 16+|pg||
nt|snigill: 4 spades is a very good contract but...|pg||
nt|nickf: :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@D 4+, but could be 3 (4432 only i think)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|malipivo:  3@c looked as a fine contract.|pg||
nt|copeyj: and 2@D probably says we are going to game opposite the strong variety|pg||
nt|snigill: bad bridge not to reach there|pg||
nt|the_clown:  and could be based on a very good fit and fewer HCP|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: they found the save against 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: il contro di nord potrebbe essere ..entrambi i nobili oppure almeno 4 carte di cuori..almeno utilizzando le due più normali accezioni del contro sull'intervento di 1@D..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: spec says 1@h with 4@h-4@s, so 1@d can be done with 3 in a 4333 (better minor)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|uni_dennis: EW can make 3@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive game will go down....one finesse works, the other doesn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|the_clown:  y W has all the time in the world to switch to a @c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is having 3 fast losers and one slow (a diamond suit).|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Hearts are easily developed here, but transportation is a major problem.|pg||
nt|jafa: Milne will need to switch to a club when in with the AD|pg||
nt|jafa: only one chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  After two rounds of heart ducking.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A club ruff would be 4th trick to the defence.|pg||
nt|the_clown:  ah I missed that declarer can get to dummy with a @s ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though with @c ruff this can be 800|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: N clearly not shy in bidding game|pg||
pc|d2|nt|adonis18:  a monumental earn for the danes:)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If in 3!n, the fifth loser would come from a club suit.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|toniemme: 10 assi per il giocante che non avrà problemi nonostante trovi il resto delle @S diviso 4 e 1..|pg||
pc|d4|nt|malipivo:  Also spades are blocked.|pg||
nt|luffe12:  appears that the board was won at other table|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am counting upto 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so 10 imps on board one to denmark|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: some work here for declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hackenbush: if anybody's gonna bid it's West with the stiff diamond and the black suits|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe E was worth a cue  instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|toniemme: il B2 ci costa 6 poiché est rialza a partita ..non iirragionevolmente e contro la manche la difesa ha gioco fascile a incassare 4 prese data la posizione del mariage di picche|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  Well, they do know that they have a lot of catching up|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|uni_dennis: not that difficult for E|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: after 3@c by N|pg||
nt|malipivo:  After developing a trick in club suit, he is not forced to guess anything in spades.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A spade and another room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So even 3@h might go down.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: setting up @hs and then needs an entry to N|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|h8|nt|copeyj: this is a slightly fortunate result for China in that you would want to play 4@S I think - but no game makes on this layout|pg||
nt|snigill: should be 7 tricks with this hans south should be more willing to play trumos rather than nt don´t you think?|pg||
nt|snigill: trumps|pg||
nt|cc469: W should not be thinking this long|pg||
nt|luffe12:  odd defense - why not continue clubs right away - nothing runs away|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is defending well, to be fair.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not much left to the hand...@h finesse off|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting play of 9@c by W...maybe they play MUD in the middle of hand?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: only 3 down now|pg||
nt|xenya: he has a whale of a hand -- suppose he bids 3@S, then W with Kxxxxx in hearts might cooperate with 4@C|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so another pick up for the Danes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|uni_dennis: @d lead knocked out the clear entry and if he tries @s to Q it won't work|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And crossruffing for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|cc469: N cannot have singeton K|pg||
nt|toniemme: tiratello il contro competitivo di sud..ma il j@H il 10@D il 98 a @C sostengono un punteggio forse carente:):)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|malipivo:  OR is in 4@hS.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|copeyj: and I think it is down 1 only|pg||
pc|c3|nt|malipivo:  There was a potential for ruffing finesse in hearts, but he just missed it. South played well for doubleton @hKQ.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: other table E played @cAKx, so N still had @DK as entry for the @hs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and 2 @c tricks already for declarer|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|snigill: d 1|pg||
nt|snigill: true|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|toniemme: scarto della cuori inutile..a prescindere dal significato delle @D giocate da est(un giocatore avrebbe il diritto di sbagkliare carta..) il taglio di 9 di @S si imponeva..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, overtaking was a small mistake from West.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|uni_dennis: E will have to give an 8th trick now and will get endplayed for 9th |pg||
pc|s2|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s7|nt|toniemme: ora con una serie di sorpassi increociati delle cave mantiene impegno:):)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|malipivo:  and now: @dA or @sA?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the 1@s bid here kept E a little out of the bidding as DBL might have shown @ss instead of take-out for the minors|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|malipivo:  Not over!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jafa: Milne had a fair inferential count and decided to play South for Qxx heart, rather than Txx or xxx|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|toniemme: al board 2 L'Italia dimezza il distacco..|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|malipivo:  Now it is over as East is not going to be endplay in one suit.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: declarer did well now|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Board 3: The other room is playing 2@h.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  1@h-(x)-1@s|pg||
nt|cc469: good @CJ play by Tan but You wasn't up to it|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@S -1 by N in OR|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|uni_dennis: 1@C = 2+|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: westerbeek can bid 3@d weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  They are in 3@c, a possible swing for Netherlands.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This deal looks like 3@s E-W.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S hand feels like a 3@d bid|pg||
nt|malipivo:  My favorite area: a slam zone!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i think you can make 4@s if you don't take the @d finesse, but go up with the A|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: careful play in @c lets you set up a winning @c for a @d discard|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|uni_dennis: so good thing that Westerbeek did not tell him he had many @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: parziale a picche per EO ...a 4@C sud dovrebbe cadere di 2 prese (1@S 3@H e il k@C..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have seen ruffing potential in Axxx(x) opposite Kx several times on this tournament.|pg||
nt|frankaus: zars followers open N hand 1@H|pg||
nt|malipivo:  First 6 imps for the Israel team on deal 2 and 3.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: welcome Michael|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: zar a sophisticated hand evaluation system  - link - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you|pg||
nt|toniemme: 2 punti lucrati ma più accettabile il passo di sala apereta sul 3@S...:):)...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hearts are distributed 3-1, meaning that fourth heart may be used for ruffing a club.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot that 6@h is on as declarer needs one of two finesses working (@dK or @cK).|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 1NT 15-17 but Kilani upgraded for his 5th @D|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: also keeps a strong S out of the bidding|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jafa: hi Gary|pg||
nt|andyv:  undo please|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: not sure what 2NT shows, but clearly some invitational or better hand with @ss|pg||
pc|h6|nt|the_clown:  undo|pg||
nt|andyv:  W bid 3NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|malipivo:  N-S would prefer to be in a heart contract.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I see slams everywhere, but this is not the case.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As cards lie I see grand one.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if wackwitz goes up declarer has enough entries for the @c|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: N not likely to hold 5@hs as well, so will not try for a @h ruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|malipivo:  Well stopped at 5th level.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: can see 8 tricks, but no 9th yet|pg||
nt|toniemme: il 3@C di est potrebbere esse tipo Wolff...(certo pure lui ha scritto delle convezioni)..o una sorta di stayman..3SA probabilmente nega 3@H e 4@S ...ed est dopo acurata indagine ...|pg||
nt|toniemme: sbarca a 6SA (plausibilissimo)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's use a third club for discarding a diamond, @dA and two diamond ruffs, we may ruff the last club as well because North couldn't overfuff @h9 with his @h7.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The problem standing alone is a transportation.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer couldn't get to West to start finessing clubs.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|toniemme: il fit di @S è andato a farsi benedire..:):)il 2@H di est parrebbe una scalta ..forse meglio passare ed aventualmente contrare eventuale 3@C..|pg||
nt|toniemme: buono attacco a picche......vediamo se il giocante leggerà lo scuizz che opererà contro nord dato che il morto ha l'otto di picche come minaccia e il giocante la quarta di fiori..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|uni_dennis: anyone for pass with S hand on the DBL?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 9 lead cannot be from KT9, and with 3 small they lead low|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so N likely to have 4@h exactly|pg||
pc|d9|nt|malipivo:  Let's hope for a small one, even that is a challenge.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|uni_dennis: looks too risky to me, so i agree with 2@h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  OR is buying 3@hN on this deal.|pg||
nt|jafa: accurate defence from the Australian E-W pair on Board2 to get the maximum from 5DX|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @d10  a bit careless, if N held singelton K|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If played @h9 now, he may start finessing in dia or in clubs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If he would finesse in diamonds, a winner might be ruffed to start finessing in clubs.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jafa: a bit too much for declarer to do here|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: OR restarted now, but operator needs top put in the right results|pg||
pc|cA|nt|uni_dennis: i can't count sorry :(|pg||
pc|c3|nt|uni_dennis: but with 2-3 trump tricks and a @D trick and partner must have something|pg||
nt|cc469: stops to think now - should have stopped to think at trick 2|pg||
nt|jafa: NS pair|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am sorry that would not be necessary.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This one shall be down soon, but the OR may make it.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so @d switch and declarer took the finesse and got a ruff for 2 down|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: not sure if that's the right way to play it, when W showed @hA and @cAKQ (discouraging signal by E)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with @dK as well might have a 1NT opening|pg||
mc|8|nt|malipivo:  from spectator:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  in board 2 argentine defender allow declarer to make 6 @S ruffing innecesarily 1 trick. if not made it he could promote his @S8. instead of 13 imps for israel could be 13 for ...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  argentina ...in board 3 if declarer choose correctly the endplay is 6 for argentina not 6 for israel...crazy much and so lucky israel|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6@c! at the other table|pg||

mb|1D|nt|malipivo:  And pressure upon South.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  its wrong score from other room... defence cashed AKS and AK trump out 170 impossible it was 2 down probably so 3 imps|pg||
nt|cc469: partner opened 1NT and with 2 aces S felt he had to double|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in battle for 8th place Singapore is playing Egypt, so they might score big |pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  This is hard to pass or just invite.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|toniemme: le francesi tirano fino a 4@S (notare che est decide di licitare le @S..e non le cuori:):)..e 5 punti ci portano a condurre il match..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Here is a problem, Vugraph operators are making small mistakes not following the plays correctly all the time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the scores are back in sync now the 1st 3 are all flat|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So the score in the scoreboard is usually the right result.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@D 5+ or 4441|pg||
mb|2C|nt|toniemme: on entrambe le sale West interviene con 1SA...leggermente discitibile..si rischia di perdere il fit ideale..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: thin DBL by E here, but N has too may @hs to pick up something|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@c was made on board 3, so 5 imps to NL|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h is there|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N seems to be the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The other room is also in 4@s, but from South's side.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jafa: interesting pass by Adam, but 1NT should play well enough|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and they were only 3VP behind Denmark before this round, so a good result is needed here for Denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: dalla regìa avvertono che Israele aveva 10 punti di carry over ..quindi il punteggio reale del match è 18 ISR 17 ITA|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@d is the max here|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: nonostante le @S favorevoli non c'è modo di fare più di 9 prese ..come del resto hanno fatto le francesi in sala apeta|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And the majority of hcps is marked.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 4: East in 2@c.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: unless diamond lead, but just 1 trick|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is confusing a lot.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We were discussing several virtual endgames the other days.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer will go down in 4@h, nothing is working for him.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Cards are sitting nicely for declarer.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  14+6 hcp but they would make 4@s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: 1 down|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and they are on the right track for that|pg||
pc|d3|nt|malipivo:  As declarer is missing @d98, yes, exactly.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i do think Westerbeek was worth another bid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|uni_dennis: on @d lead you can pitch the @s loser on the @c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR is in 4@hW.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|malipivo:  This is a likely push.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If I don't start swapping cards, there is no way to make it.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|malipivo:  operator: 4@h E-W?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|the_clown:  it was important to play @HK in order to ensure 2 entries to dummy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could have ducked|pg||
nt|the_clown:  or one entry and the tempo to play @d at trick2 |pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: Singapore really bidding every game possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The other room in 2@cE.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is tempting to be in !n contract E-W, well, East is weak in diamonds and there are no side entries.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  As a fan to slams, this one is close, but missing two aces.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  K fourth in clubs is blocking fast winners in potential risky 3!n.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Running scores:|pg||

nt|malipivo:  They are transferring to a diamond contract. 3@d it is as in the other room (they play it from East hand).|pg||
pc|d4|nt|malipivo:  This shall go down heavily soon.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: looks like 2@C was GF|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: N using 4th suit to make a GF raise in @hs, 3@h over 2@d would be invitational i guess|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: and 2@H on 5 gives Argentina the 1st imps of the match|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: bd 4 2@c -1 in OR|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@C should show @h fit. with @s N can bid 3@s and with @D support he can bid 4@d|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: France in OR also in 6@h after N started with a GF 2NT (3+fit) bid|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|jafa: 9 tricks here if declarer plays on clubs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@h +1 looked a bit strange as well, as declarer still had to lose a trump|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|toniemme: on entrambe le sale sono le francesi ad assumere l'iniziativa...ovest in terza posizione apre leggera e con scarsi requisiti distribuzionali..qui sulla bicolore @D @C sud ripete la ...|pg||
nt|toniemme: quinta di @H...non bellissima ..|pg||
nt|toniemme: avrebbe fatto meglio a passare..talvolta il compagno ha 5 carte di fiori..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so the captains have to check the scores after this match|pg||
nt|cc469: good decision by E imo as his hand has no enties for his p in NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they bid 7, they  better know a good rabbi|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in OR South recieved a @d lead, but luckily for Denmark this will always make|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jafa: although communications are awkward|pg||
pc|cK|nt|uni_dennis: more and more pairs use some sort of relay over a 1M opening|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: would work fine here as N will then here the 2641 shape and then he has a very good slam hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|malipivo:  It will be interesting to check the results from other tables.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but natural bidding works out just fine on this one|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If you are wondering why it is not doubled (in general), because N-S may escape to 4@c contract.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jafa: if he plays a club to the king and then a diamond to the queen and ace, the defenders would be able to knock out his last entry to hand|pg||
nt|jafa: but with the AD in S, all is well|pg||

nt|andyv:  I don't have a CC for any of the pairs so I don't know the reason for bidding 2@c instead of 1@h with the N hand|pg||

nt|andyv:  spec tells me 2@c is game forcing with any hand...thank you|pg||

nt|malipivo:  The other room is in 4@hN on this deal.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: better was to play 2 rounds of trumps ending in dummy|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It would require some preparations in the middle part of the play.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|uni_dennis: so 10 imps back |pg||
mb|d!|nt|toniemme: un kib (ex juniores) dic che in questo board non è apparsa la foga licitativa tipica dei giovani..in effetti 2 licite MOLTO conservative..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: DBL = 5+m 4M|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: licita non chiarissima delle nostre ragazze in sala aperta..atterrano in un 5 fiori ...discutibile:):) ma rubacchiano una presa...|pg||

nt|andyv:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The previous board was an opportunity for both teams, West balanced and 9 hcps could strike harder, I guess.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is a potential loser in every suit.|pg||
nt|xenya: Denmark will need to do very well to retain the lead|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@h played by S in OR, after N showed 5+@h with 2@c instead of 2@h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: East cannot bid his @ds as 2@D would ask for the Major|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i don't really like his pass, West will surely lead @cs and it can get somewhat costly, say -380|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: while they have a big lead|pg||
mb|r!|nt|malipivo:  In real bridge finding a King singleton is pretty difficult task.|pg||
nt|toniemme: è stata una pausa pubblicitaria..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so don't need to make 'extreme' decisions here|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  As I see slams everything, this might be one.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in N the defense can start with 3 rounds of @s for a @d pitch and then the @D ruff will mean -1|pg||
mb|2C|nt|uni_dennis: in OR 4@h made|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: because it was played by S |pg||
mb|d!|nt|kiwibridge: and a change to board 3 makes it 5-3 Argentina tight match|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: now he will make|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: not really sure why E did not lead @s here. S practically denied @s control and N also signed of|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: agree|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: or even just a game try as a kib points out, though i believe they play 1M-2M as 8-10|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The question is if diamonds can be developed fast enough.|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not so sure...|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: DBL take-out|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: possibile swing francese..battere 3SA è praticamente impossibile dato che ovest attaccherà piccola @H.....buona l'idea di aprire 1SA con le carte di Sud...guadagno casuale ma ...|pg||
nt|toniemme: prodotto da buona valutazione..|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for N to bid 2@h?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot that @hQ is not an entry on this deal. It could but that's not today.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  What a lead!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|malipivo:  But make it anyway as @cA wasn't played.|pg||
nt|cc469: S is not sure he has 2 cashing @Cs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: ah, the @s ruff in other room meant he could set up @ds, here E has 3rd @h left|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so much more difficult here|pg||
nt|xenya: very tricky, to say the least|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think you have to strrip squeeze West, including finding the lucky fall of @H10|pg||
nt|xenya: my bet is that he will go down|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|malipivo:  from spec: they underled A @D in OR, thank you|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now I see it as 3@hN+1 in the scoreboard.|pg||
mb|p|nt|the_clown:  I cant find one|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: licita oscura ma pratica in sala aperta..forse 4@H un buon appoggio a picche e tentativo..|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: wow going overboard completely now|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i think N should DBL this with those good @cs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: especially when they need the imps|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: is there a chance to make this?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @s lead will kill the entries for the @d suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|malipivo:  So a major opportunity for Argentina.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But the problem remains as it is.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@s tricks 1@c, 2@D and 2@h seems like max|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: fair shot that ... the winning play was obscure to say the least|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this looks like a normal line of play, though E will need a lot of @cs for this to work|pg||
pc|d9|nt|malipivo:  I would bid 1@s as North as a waiting bid, but it might not be the best strategy when 5-3 fit is found.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|malipivo:  Even this is not helping as @sT8 will be facing @sK9.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and def will make 2@h 1@c 2@d at least|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The results on BBO aren't official, so I cannot tell you for sure if it was 3@h or 4@h.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: looked like -1|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: you always feel you want to bid more if you don't show your 5-5 immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|jafa: conservative initial pass from North|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jafa: South want to play 3NT opposite a Diamond stopper, or 4H opposite a 5card heart suit and doubles to get more information|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If there is a slam, it is in minor suit.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may discard two losing spades in the other minor.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am happy we are in the slamland again.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I must say 3!n is pretty difficult.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: Westerbeek might have tried 2N this time|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: instead of 2@h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@h should show long @hs and weak|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but he has a nice 10 count (good intermediates in @c) and only 5@h|pg||
pc|d5|nt|malipivo:  I am thinking about 3@h.|pg||
nt|cc469: 3@H is a little timid|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: was N doubling for penalties here? South thinking it was take-out?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: can bid 2NT, if W has 3@h and max he will bid 3@h|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|uni_dennis: take-out DBLs by NS here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  It happens on this tournament, that vugraph operator makes a mistake and the play is actually different.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT will go a few off|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hackenbush: he can more comfortably sit this 2@cx|pg||
nt|xenya: this lead might give declarer a chance|pg||
pc|s7|nt|malipivo:  Board 7: now official site is +170 so it seems right 10 imps to argentina|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Hop|pg||
nt|cc469: 4@H by N was an easy bid on this auction|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: or did N know he was making a take-out DBL and thought he had enough to bid 3NT if S bid 3@C|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: wackwitz had something in reserve as well, but no reason to bid anymore|pg||
pc|sA|nt|richardt: suppose it gets home|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so Singapore will pick up 6 or 7 imps as they continue to bid games|pg||
pc|cA|nt|richardt: 2x@ss|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We see 12 tricks in 6@c/@d, but in general it is a bad idea to be missing a trump queen and a side ace (considering 6@c).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Therefore 6@d is a better slam as we may drop or ruff out the @cQ.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The transportation would not be a problem as diamonds are breaking friendly 2-1.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|malipivo:  Well done!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|uni_dennis: can set up some @H|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: to make 2@S 3@h 2@D 1@c and maybe another @S|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: or @C|pg||
nt|xenya: N's double looks like cards from out here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: don't know why E choose @s lead with this @s holding, looks like they agreed never to lead West's suit|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|uni_dennis: if N had cashed before @ds then declarer could have ruffed a @h before exiting in @d, thus losing just 1 trump|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: meanwhile 2@dX was 3 off on bd 6 in OR|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: and finds a very nice dummy|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The summary of the first half: 32-imp difference, 23-7 in favor of Netherlands.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but N found a raise|pg||
pc|s2|nt|toniemme: in apeta sud non sapendo se aprire di tre ..data settima o di due dato il resto 222 decide per il passo..tanto il colore è bruttino e ci sono valori esterni..condivisibile..|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  is 5@h on?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Juniors, all players are aged 25 or younger.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: nice stop here by NS|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@c contract is not that bad.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|toniemme: qui in modo più grezzo ma accettabile sud decide per il 2 debole..un punticino per noi dato attacco a @D da ovest|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: although 3NT makes on a @h lead|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but i doubt W would lead it|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: EW could have 'saved' in 4@s, that would only fail on a @c ruff as kib says|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: no @c ruff on this lay-out so should be an easy 620|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  S may have some difficulties with the 4-1 @d break.  He should ruff a @s early for his 10th trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|malipivo:  He will start ruffing spades or clubs soon.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|toniemme: sud scarta la dama per confondere le acque nel saco est avesse la settima a @D non saprebbe chi degli altri due giocatori sia singolo..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: it doesn't|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|toniemme: sud non gioca atout ma è fortunella a non prende la promozione in atout..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A lot of things is going on, but I am unsure if all are real, let's they are.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|uni_dennis: 650 actually|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|cc469: I guess he's hoping @HQ is onside|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cc469: blackwood enquiry showed 2 aces without the @HQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defence must be careful to cash @cA in time.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d4|nt|toniemme: l'attacco a @D ..peraltro obbligato dalla licita rimette un poco in sesto il 3@S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Otherwise 3 spades provide enough winners.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|toniemme: speriamo nel claimm..|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|uni_dennis: maybe W should have shown a 4-card support instead of a simple raise|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|nevaio: IL barrage..non proprio scolastico di Padon ci spinge fuori contratto|pg||
pc|c3|nt|malipivo:  Well, if it is really 3@d, it shall be doubled.|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes, it does make, sorry :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|uni_dennis: then E could have bid 4@s with his singleton @h |pg||
nt|malipivo:  Playing @dA at first trump attack would be better.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|malipivo:  3!n might go down on a perfect defence|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: looks like Singapore is going to score the maximum against Egypt and since Denmark got a penalty of 0,5 VP (don't know why) Denmark must score 23-7 in this match|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so need to win by 31+ imps if i'm correct|pg||
pc|c9|nt|malipivo:  But doubling is risky as opponents will try to escape or are aware of bad suit breaks.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|malipivo:  A good news to fans of Argentina: new leader coming.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nevaio: ma 3p nn contrate quindi..|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: unless something happens to italy there|pg||
mb|2S|nt|malipivo:  a slam zone!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 10, OR is still bidding, but slam would go down on accurate defence (@sK, a club lead).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is playing 1!nXE.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: West opened a heavy 3NT in OR|pg||

mb|3H|nt|jafa: an excellent 7H here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They are in 5@h.|pg||
mb|d!|nt|malipivo:  Well, leading from KJ or QT is no beauty for defenders.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT now?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: or just support @c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am happy to say: a slam zone!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the youngsters section the next teams will qualify:|pg||
nt|toniemme: in aperta sud si innamora delle carte e anche con una buona dose di sfortuna (fortuna per noi( paga la 1100..|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  well, 2@s would be on if it stays this way|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 10: 2 imps at stake as 2 overtricks mean 60 points. Players scored maximum in this room.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In a possible heart slam, defence must cash diamonds soon, as spade finesse (@sT) and also double finesse in clubs (@cQJ) provide enough winners to discard a @d6. Otherwise it would be 6@h+1.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But this is a theory.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's think about 7@dX N-S, how many tricks it would go down?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: DBL take-out, but can also be a way to get to 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: Australia need something now|pg||
nt|toniemme: il 3@D di nord mette sassolini sulla strada licitativa delle nostra..nell'altra sala il barrage dxi passo non ha sortito effetti..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: Poland, France, Israel, Sweden, USA 1, Australia, England and Italy|pg||

nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: non facile per west passare..vero che p non ha fatto cue bid..ma basterebbe avesse picche decenti perché slam non sia disprezzabile..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@C usually 5-5 already, so supporting @c looks best|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If E-W would attack diamonds at every opportunity, @cT might score the 5th trick for defence.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, E-W in 6@h.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though there is a battle for 8th between Italy and China (now 4VP the difference half way this set)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A friendly lead as declarer cannot manage it otherwise (finessing against @cK).|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: il 3 picche di est è molto discutibile..ma in ogni caso la licita si nord è stata buona...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  In theory he could, trying @hQ first and if it fails, ruff third round of hearts.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|uni_dennis: 6@d was quite OK after the 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @hK rated to be onside|pg||
pc|h6|nt|uni_dennis: W expecting more from East's 2@h call|pg||
nt|nevaio: stanno giocando bene..gli unici punti persi sono per una mano sfortunata.un bel 4p chiamato.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|uni_dennis: with those big @s behind the opener he doesn't expect them to make 5@C|pg||
nt|nevaio: quante mani giocano?|pg||
nt|toniemme: nove prese non saranno un problema per nord che sa che @D 5 e 3 (giocano miglior minore)..e data apertura non dovrebbe sbagliare manovra di @S e @C..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and then need a good @c decision|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And now a fight for a overtricks. I am suprised there is no XX.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: he didn't ask himself which defensive tricks he was planning to take|pg||
nt|andyv:  the club values opposite the singleton should bring convince E not to explore for slam|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: EW clearly agreed never to lead West's suit. He doesn't even do it himself :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jafa: 4S RKC for H|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but well done here now that the @hK is offside|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 6N would make with @h lead|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and right @c|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  not quite sure I agree with N's 2@H overcall here, even with them chasing the game|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i like 2@h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|uni_dennis: can't let them bid, with passed hand partner|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  that said, they are quite aggressive so this fits in with their style.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|malipivo:  likely 4-imp to Israel|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A swing for Israel. 11 imps.|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jafa: 5NT shows spade king i believe, so edgtton can bid 7|pg||

pc|c2|nt|jafa: well done|pg||

pc|h3|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Michael, would you be kind enough to explain the auction from 3NT for us|pg||
nt|jafa: 4S was RKC for hearts, 5C 3, 5S confirms all keycards and asks for kings, 5NT SK or other two kings (i think)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: 3NT was a serious slam try?|pg||
nt|jafa: i think they play non serious 3NT, but not 100% on that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks|pg||
nt|jafa: the Argentinian pair at the other table have had a bidding misunderstanding and settled in 5S|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: well, if the dutch juniors don't bid it, it will be a bad contract indeed :)|pg||

nt|malipivo:  4@hN would be -9, 900, 5@cX -4 for 1100|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@hX was made so 6 imps to Argentina|pg||
nt|malipivo:  that's good news|pg||
nt|malipivo:  According to my experience, this table will crash down and will be reopened. Let's see.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the meantime, let's tell something about the tournament|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am on it|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results (choosing round/cross table, table/team, and even boards) for all three series here:|pg||

nt|andyv:  not too many books written on how to play 3-3 fits|pg||

nt|malipivo:  We are watching 2nd round playing 14 boards.|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  they are in 6@D in the other room|pg||
mb|5D|nt|uni_dennis: 5@D seems like a nice way to describe East hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: although you might argue that @Ds aren't good enough|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  opening 5@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: ovvio che imtervento di 1sa non sia da fare ..ma qui sono stati commessi errori gravi che anche se non eclatanti come quello di aperta ci costano una tombola..|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  If you are using older BBO version, there shall be "Movie" button.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is not our first timer at this tournament as we see Axx(xx) opposite Kx as a potential for ruffing.|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  USA1 and Italy seem secure in their 6th and 7th spots|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: not sure if Wackwitz showed 5-5 with 3@h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with min and 5-5 he would have bid 3@h over 2@d already|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so maybe he believes that he showed extras already|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and @cK isn't that nice and no good source of tricks that run immediately|pg||
pc|d9|nt|malipivo:  Any voters for 5@c as sacrifice?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: USA1 and Italy are 6th and 7th, and battle for 8th is between Denmark and Singapore|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: can be beaten 2 tricks if @D ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@h = 5@h and 3+@S (van Lankveld noemen we het) en unbal dus of 4@s-5@h of 3514/3541 of 3550|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||

nt|andyv:  N did well to go down 3 and 4 imps for Denmark|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: both Netherlands and Israel did well against Italy|pg||
nt|toniemme: argomento interessante:):) ...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Nicely done and 11 imps to Netherlands.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|2N!|nt|uni_dennis: this is a nice hand|pg||
nt|nevaio: ma per l'Israele ci pensa Fisher...son tutte sue..non deve chiederle:)|pg||
nt|toniemme: 2@H mostra 4 7 con 4o5 @H e 5@S ..(garozzo docet)|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: the maximum carry-over is 10 imps however|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 11 imps back for Singapore, will this start their comeback?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: N opened 2@h in the OR, showing 5@h and 3+@s and unbal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kiwibridge: opps theres a swift 10 back|pg||
nt|jafa: ; )|pg||
nt|toniemme: qui 3SA meno 3 parrebbe erroraccio invece è frutto di carte avvelenate per la linea EO..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2@d-4, that's misunderstanding of some king, specs and I have no better explanation|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: misunderstanding here by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: transfer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *kind|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@C = 2+ and S thinks he showed minors|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: playing 3@CX by N, as S asked and N bid an artificial 3@C that was doubled|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and S decided to pass|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: will be a costly board on both tables as 3@Cx might go 500, 800..|pg||
mb|4N|nt|malipivo:  Well, 10 imps to Israel.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: meanwhile we forgot to watch the play, 3N was made in the other room after a @c lead, and 2 off here, so 13 to France|pg||
nt|nevaio: 3q a|pg||
mb|5D|nt|malipivo:  2@D was transfer to @H, east forgot it|pg||
nt|nevaio: anche in aperta|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: this will be a double partial as 3@h makes|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  I can't bear to watch this...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but both sides can only go to 5-level|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has a lot of work to do...he may try cashing the A@h, and play a @c to K and ruff a @h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i'm surprided westerbeek did not have an opinion about 5@d|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  yes, I was expecting it to be doubled|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: all of a sudden we have imps galore and much blood|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats more like it :)|pg||
nt|jafa: 3NT is the spot here, hopefully Edgtton and Milne are on the same wavelength regarding the 2S bid|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: nice 4@c bid by W here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|malipivo:  sacrifice at 5th level may be real|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: got them to 5 level, but still an easy make|pg||
nt|andyv:  then he can hope for K@s to be Kx onside or @cs to be 3-3|pg||
nt|toniemme: farà probabilmente dieci prese anticipando curi dal morto..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is aware of his only entry (@hA), he will start developing diamonds soon.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching juniors, all players are aged 25 or younger.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Results and running scores for all series:|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  still, this is going to cost a bit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jafa: many pairs play it as a natural shaping out type call, showing 3145 or similar|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|toniemme: cuori..|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|jafa: oh no ! ; )|pg||
nt|jafa: i don't think Milne expected this|pg||
nt|nevaio: Padon e Fisher hnno giocato gli Europei nella squadra Open|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its become a bit of a nightmare after a tight 1st half|pg||
nt|andyv:  now on @c, W should rise and play another trump|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|toniemme: guadagnamo 3 punti dato che il contratto cadrù di 2 prese..2@C e 2@D...+100 Italia:)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|uni_dennis: maybe EW take their plus score and expect a decent result from the other room|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jafa: they obviously have very differnt ideas about this auction |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|malipivo:  from spec: @C lead - 1 off in 4@S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|uni_dennis: so +300 or so should be OK then|pg||
mc|8|nt|toniemme: cadrù è un neologismo...|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: some hardly needed 7 imps|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As we are approaching to the last board, we would like to thank World Bridge Federation, Chinese Contract Bridge Association & Bridge Base Online for broadcasting this event, and,|pg||
nt|malipivo:  spectators for joining us at this table, their wisdom, and we wish the best luck to all the participants in next matches! This is a great experience for them at the international level.|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  2 off doubled at the other table|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though hard to imagine they can make anything above 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|nevaio: noi abbiamo  Delle Cave(Giuseppino)e Di Franco che sono i veterani ed i forti della squadra|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Last, but not least, our thanks go to our Vugraph operator! Very well done!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Next round starts in about 40 minutes according to the BBO plan:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  from spec: 4S is stone. lead @C also make|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @cKQ are sitting nicely for declarer.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Sooner or later a @cT will score 10th trick.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|malipivo:  yes, very true: for @C ruff S must take A@S 1st round - compressing original trump trick !|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so 5 imps to singapore|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cc469: I would have expected W to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: opening 4@h is a way to get there|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|uni_dennis: 2NT 4+fit, INV+|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: uno slam non brutto...ORRIBILE...il board sarà pareggiato a 3SA e dopo attacco a picche lisciato il giocante farà circa 12 prese:):)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  interesting treatment of the majors by W|pg||
nt|jafa: 1S is no 4cM, or 5+D and a strong hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@h will be down but a bunch of imps for Netherlands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: looks like 5@c is a good save for -300|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  hard for N to sacrifice looking at 2 aces and the Q of @H though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and could well be 500 or more|pg||
nt|nevaio: Gandoglia ,al debutto internazionale ;sta giocando bene...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: I find 2NT opener by E unnecessary - |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I think we need some undo's|pg||
nt|toniemme: notate come gli interventi in barrage siano una caratteristica tutta francese..le nostre al massimo sbarrano a livello uno..|pg||
nt|christinas:  dangerous board, they might get to 6H!|pg||
nt|nevaio: E Pure in aperta  Zanasi nn sembra soffrire l'evento|pg||
pc|hK|nt|uni_dennis: looks like 4 losers|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks down one.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  as pointed out by spec, in OR, it looks as if NS went off 1 in 4@s, not 2 if you look at the vugraph movie.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so, this will be a push and denmark will need to find 15 imps on the last 2 boards as singapore is on a 25 now|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: unless he can get rid of his @d loser, but can't see how|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|toniemme: ora dopo 5 giri di fiori speriamo che ovest legga il finale...un pinto è sempre un punto..!!!:):)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, 2@sE.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cc469: and so ... -1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  informed by kibitzer that 1@s showd @D or a big hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d9|nt|malipivo:  It was useful free finesse as East is marked with longer hearts.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|toniemme: corretto stop degli israeliani..buon attacco di sud e corretta lettura della carta di attacco (busso da parte di Nord..|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  when you have shaky trump, the opps can at least be decent and have the suit split 3-2|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: he had a chance there...|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|christinas:  it can only make if declarer ruffs 2 diamonds, pitches a diamond and spade on the AK of clubs, plays the K of hearts and guesses to finess the nine|pg||
nt|nevaio: era meglio tornare cn il 10 d'atout|pg||
nt|nevaio: rispetto agli e|pg||
nt|toniemme: auspicando buone @D a Sud la giocata di 10 avrebbe assoggettato una eventuale dama o il re come nel caso alla tenaglia di Sud...Nord ha fatto risparmiuccio:):)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nevaio: europei juniores noi senza Madala..ma loro senza un paio di giocatori forti(Birman,ed un altro che nn ricordo)|pg||
nt|toniemme: Birman è il nipote del Birman che capitanava gli Juniores negli Europei dell'82 a Salsomaggiore..|pg||
nt|nevaio: figlio di Birman (ottimo giocatore)|pg||
nt|toniemme: figlio? ok:):)|pg||
