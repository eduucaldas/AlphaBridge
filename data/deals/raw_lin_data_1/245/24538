If battaggia didn't want to take the risk of playing three rounds of spades, he had better take in dummy and lead trumps to his hand, which makes a huge difference if north holds the singleton ace|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: Mo¿ê to jaka podstêpna globalna taktyka, jak u schoolsow - najpierw oddaæ 20, a potem wygraæ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: narzeie nad kandydatem do 4-ki Francj¹ mamy 35 VP przewagi|pg||
nt|minimeck: This seems a pretty normal board here, North has a clear 4@s bid, sort of a 2-way bid, he is bidding to make but opposite some hands certainly might be a good save|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This match in particular features two teams on the verge of qualifying.|pg||

nt|galallie:  Its okay Matthew, now you have me :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: W showed a @h-splinter after he heard @s-fit and E bid the slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: Chance for a french pickup out of the gate. slam time in hcp, missing cashing AK :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@h a weak-2, but dutch juniors only require a 5card to do that in 1st hand|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|uni_dennis: they like to put the pressure on quickly|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The slam is off, but this might be cozy 4@h.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: exciting deal, but no one can really make anything, 3@s and 4@c the max.|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|malipivo:  We are watching Juniors, round 6, according to this plan:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/TaicangScheduleOfPlay.pdf|pg||
nt|minimeck: unfortunately no need to lead it even, hopelessly mirrored and only 10 tricks |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|malipivo:  Open Room is playing 4@cN. There was no desire to try 3!n.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: the preempt did his work here|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: po klikniêciu z lewej stronyt na numer stolu, mozna obejrzec wyniki posczegolnych meczow|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is easy for us to spot a heart lead, and it is there.|pg||
nt|minimeck: NS tend to open "almost" all 11 counts, this one did not fit that criteria :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  OR, 3!nW.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  1@D shows 11-15 with at least 1 or 2 Diamonds, depending on partnership agreement|pg||
nt|galallie:  good pass by East|pg||
mb|5C|nt|minimeck: -50's|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well, he knows that even though his partner is at the max, they don't have the points for game, and he can smell a bad @S break with the double|pg||
nt|minimeck: slam is purely 50%, although better with the opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lukasz1982: Je³i rzeczywiscie pad³o 2@s, to powinno odrobinê wyjaniæ sk³ady|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: declarer needs to get @hs right to make 4@s, but after the 2@h opener he won't go wrong |pg||
mb|6S|nt|malipivo:  5@d from defenders?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, not today.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3NT mesns 16 19 6+S|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  looks very unlikely that declarer will get 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n looks makeable as diamonds are friendly distributed 5-3.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But also needs good guessing in spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Roger might try 3H instead of the more obvious 3NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In this deal hearts are sitting nicely.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  This won't challenge W at all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: actually declarer can't easily make use of this extra diamond trick|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: open room also in 4@s, but played by south after a gadget in the bidding: pas - 1@d - pas - 3@c as 6+@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @c lead there, so declarer needs to get @hs right|pg||
nt|poohbear: No guess. Cant let South in|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h would go down one.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  welcome!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|johnjones:  He'll play HA, and a H|pg||
nt|hackenbush: then another diamond will put him to a decision|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Lee takes his time. In the last World University Bridge Championship, he took 10 minutes for a play decision in a slam|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Then he will go for several hands and play at the speed of light.  But when he thinks, it will be for a while.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is buying 5@dX.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  now there's a chance|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d3|nt|johnjones:  A club lead will defeat 6.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have 4 clubs, 1 diamond, 3 hearts, at least one round of spades is expected for the 9th trick.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: because you cannot enter it (safety against misclicks)|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Good morning/afternoon/evening from the Czech Republic, my name is Pavel Striz and hopefully I will be (one of) your guide(s) in this match at this table helping out with typed commentary. |pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please feel free to personal message me during the match but also please don't be offended in any thinkable way if I don't respond to you or if I don't pass your notes and ideas to the audience. |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: matko boska z jakiego b¹d kocio³¹ - ró¿nych operatorów widzia³em ale to co tu demonstruj¹ to rekord kosmosu|pg||
nt|z_lasu: nie dobrze jak nam biora w sumie 16 lew na bez atu, a to my mamy przywilej wistu|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry - czuwam od 3 i co mi siê pochrzani³o|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: Netherlands still lying 1st, bulgaria is 10th at the moment|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This looks like a partscore battle, 4@h shall be -1.|pg||
nt|galallie:  no games to be made here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lukasz1982: chyba by³oby tak jak na drugim stole - zabrak³oby jednego zejscia do reki i wypromowa³by sie trzeci atut|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Nope, this hand is one of partscores and sacrifices|pg||
nt|minimeck: Looks like will need the club lead to set this 3nt, hung will bid 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Could we see a pass of 1S X here/|pg||
nt|malipivo:  as I see slams everywhere, this must be one of them|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a spade and a diamond loser is there|pg||
nt|poohbear: undo please|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Roger will probably bid 4@C|pg||
nt|galallie:  winning bid is to pass 3spades given the vulnerability. or double.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|malipivo:  There is many of you, I am just one (even weighting 250 pounds, 115 kg). With the help of Dealer's will I won't make many mistakes today. :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  China currently standing 2nd (140 VPs), Costa Rica currently standing 19th (55 VPs).|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  this doesn't look like he can get 8 tricks. Let's see how lotan tackles this|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: Przestawi³e siê ju¿ na czas chiñski?|pg||
nt|minimeck: or puuppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: witamy Julka Klukowskiego - przy nim nie bêd¹ mi ¿adne g³upie my³i pl¹taæ siêpo g³owie - julku proszê|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@d 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|malipivo:  likely 2@s is going down one|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Good pass by Roger|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hackenbush: down 2 at least|pg||
nt|malipivo:  My morning praying for slams is fulfulling as there is our second.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If interested, my today's morning kicker is (Gothic music; The Gathering: Mandylion): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYBu10QBut0|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 3@d a Bergen Raise, but CC doesn't say how strong, 10-11 presumably|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@s would be down one, but that's difficult contract.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, a slamland on this deal.|pg||
nt|galallie:  yes. he cant x with his hand, also an x may be responsive|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ryskiel_: mo¿na to tak nazwaæ £ukaszu|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Julku|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: W Chinach jest ju¿ popo³udnie, 6godzin póniej. Dzisiejszy dzieñ ma odrobinê inny harmonogram, bo w prrzeciwientwie do pozostalych kategorii, juniorzy nie mieli wolnego ...|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: przedpoludnia, tylko czwarty mecz|pg||
nt|poohbear: maybe|pg||
nt|poohbear: actually the slam is cold|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, @sK is sitting nicely|pg||
nt|malipivo:  What a slam, I hope they will bid it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer on a non spade lead can strip the hand and knowing that North has at most 2@ss from the bidding can play ace and a @s to the Q and claim no  matter who has the king|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  NS missed game for +170 only, so this will be the first real blood of the match!!!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is real bridge, so a peaceful contract and fight for overtricks.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  On a non-spade lead slam has its chances.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching the 14th World Youth Team Championships:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Information.htm|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: i to juz od 9, czyli 3 naszego czasu (ale naszej reprezentacji w tej kategorii w tym roku nie ma)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT a transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: *3@S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|malipivo:  We are in the middle stage of the round robin playing 16 boards.|pg||
nt|frankaus: all  4 hands 4333 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: just now ,the director came ,result had been -2|pg||
nt|poohbear: If North wins the king dbltn he has to give a ruff sluff|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  defence was considering sacrificing, but not today|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Juniors, round 8, according to this plan:|pg||
nt|kluk: witam wszystkich, ktorzy wstali wczesnie, zeby podziwiac nasze dziewczeta|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: dzien dobry:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 9 tricks now, 4@d 4@s + whichever one the defense chooses to give you|pg||
mb|3N|nt|johnjones:  A typical pushy vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  a trump will be the best lead for the defense|pg||
nt|hackenbush: to be fair, game was far from laydown|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/TaicangScheduleOfPlay.pdf|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results and running scores for all three series here:|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  True, but the layout looks friendly enough for both 4H and 3NT to work.  |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hop avoided the @c lead, so will go 1 off|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h is a fine contract for the other side, diamonds providing winners fro a club discard|pg||
nt|minimeck: North very well might take the plunge here, not the best shape however|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Three suits double stopped.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rzecz nie w wicie lecz w licytacji w poprzednim rozdaniu|pg||
nt|minimeck: a narrow target shooting for -500 |pg||
nt|minimeck: :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theory, 4@s is going down 3, let's see if they find it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  All three series are playing the same boards, we may compare their results afterwards easily.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: 1@d = pewnie @h, a kontra fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West should bid the slam. singleton @c and an important @s card|pg||
nt|poohbear: and sure enuff|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It was a nice bid.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He will have a right to play it, but bidding is not over.|pg||
nt|poohbear: save is reasonable|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@d went down a lot in the other room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot two diamonds ruffs in a club contract.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|johnjones:  with the CA wrong, down 1 looks likely|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'd expect a game too many versus a game too few from the juniors.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: lub cos:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: will normally make this, but he can go wrong|pg||
nt|poohbear: more likely 2 ruffs in a @d contract|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|johnjones:  Against that, Lee will to well to go down 2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They went down in 4@h in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|z_lasu: to prawda|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeste na tropie ktr=3 kiery|pg||
nt|kluk: wyglada na 11 lew|pg||
nt|kluk: przepraszam 10|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, thank you|pg||
pc|c5|nt|malipivo:  Declarer lead trumps too early forgetting his only chance: clubs.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Personally, I dont particularly like the odds of 4@s, his 3@s bid allready showed his hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: winning 3 imps versus losing a bunch if 4@h was not making, need to be pretty sure :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The risk is that 500/800 points are there for sure, 4@h might still have a chance to get beaten.|pg||
nt|galallie:  this should be down two|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yep|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@sX -1 on bd 2, so 7 imps back to Netherlands|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, 4@sN, @hK lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If North would have three diamonds and two clubs, there is one possible ruff.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|poohbear: So lets see if Nabil can play it as well as he bid it|pg||
nt|poohbear: I say yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|malipivo:  Board 2 is a 12-imp victory for France.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the endgame, they developed them, but it was too late.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nasze i tak podwi³y liczbê impów w stosunku do pierwszego meczu|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: podwoi³y|pg||
nt|z_lasu: tutaj spory pech ze kiery 3-3 bo by bylo tylko 8 lew na bez atu, a w piki koncowka by szla|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale nasze te¿ graj¹ 3 BA wiêc o pechu nie mo¿emy mówiæ|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if he decides to take a @h finesse for example|pg||
nt|frankaus: prob duck @c in presumed safe (w) hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: IF he had not do that,the contract was "make"|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: playing on @c will get him home indeed with 2@s, 3@h, 1@d, 3@c |pg||
pc|c2|nt|lukasz1982: AJx kier jest przed kierami, wiec w zasadzie nic sie wielkiego nie dzieje|pg||
nt|galallie:  returning the 10 of diamonds wouldve made it easier for the defense|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: now no @c9 so duck to W|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defense is accurate.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|johnjones:  Anything but a C now and declarer is sunk|pg||
nt|keylime:  I can't see North breaking open what appears to him/her as a half-frozen suit.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|coolbeans:  Now -1|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lukasz1982: i dubel trrefl przy dublu kier, wiec nawet nie da sie przebic :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: @c9 would undo decl plan|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As we see, spades are 2-2, the third spade in South hand would be there waiting.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  These little partials add up after 56 boards|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|hackenbush: heading towards 3 down, if NS collects the @dK|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A D shift at trick 2 would have left the defense better placed|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he is working on it|pg||
nt|poohbear: I played with him in Australia a couple of years ago and he is a very good card player|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lukasz1982: i teraz juz 11 :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|malipivo:  In theory, diamonds would provide enough winners for club discards.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|johnjones:  Even then, declarer would probably go wrong.  Grant Baze used to teach to guess the leader for the Ace in a premature underlead situation.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|uni_dennis: claim now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|uni_dennis: fisher hoping west has @sKx originally and forgot to unblock|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|keylime:  Exactly.|pg||
mc|9|nt|uni_dennis: now he needs the @c finesse, but it's offside|pg||
pg||
