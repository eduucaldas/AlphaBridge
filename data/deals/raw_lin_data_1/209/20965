nt|xenya: but he opted for a natural bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what about a good practical bid|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D shows one of the major suits|pg||
nt|ady: Nortj will be very surprised its spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt=Lebensohl|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT with stiff king not usual|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Herbsts play Nat, Acol based, Major 5, better minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@C natural but may be a two card suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Traian.|pg||
nt|bobholl: they won't bid 3nt anymore i guess :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: FREAK hand for north first up|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Somers and Both both from Belgium according to their badge|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi naresh|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphznv: hi all - and wlc to Veldhoven|pg||
nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Victor|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|lml: this auction is following the same lines as in the Open Room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it is Stansby taking a pause here|pg||
nt|lml: the trick will be the opening lead against a 6 level contract by north south|pg||
nt|panosk: gd morning to all|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  leb   3@D direct would be forcing to game I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We have some huge technical problems with the PC and internet connections here in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: SORRY for that|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We are getting some technical assistance- and will try to be back very soon |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we know you are doing all you can Jan, no worries|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And the bidding on Board 18 in this room went |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@h opening from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@h (preempt)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass fromN|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pass from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: then N bid 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: going down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he took the pass card out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fallenius may cue bid 4@S|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: a relatively peaceful hand, for starters?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  EW CC: http://tinyurl.com/66ttlf5|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u reopen as West?|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 3N in open|pg||
nt|kit: Pachtman knows his partner is short in hearts.  What he doesn't know about is the club fit.  But he can see 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South in the tank|pg||
nt|barnets: same bidding in open south passed|pg||
nt|kit: if South finds a 4@C call, North can reasonably bid the slam.|pg||
nt|kit: But bidding 4@C is a pretty big position I think.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and likely pass here too. S has no bid for that matter.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is still thinking|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can't NS make 6@C?|pg||
nt|kit: of course they can|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might have overcalled 1nt as east|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi david,geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is somewhat of a punt|pg||
nt|ady: north bidding his shape if not his hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: who needs points!?|pg||
nt|ady: better than 4@H  they may have got to with a free run|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south doubles the azurri may run but if he doesnt then they might make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Dennis and all specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: today we have session 4, 5 and 6 of the semi finals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|dgame: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bulgaria bid 6@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Round 10 and Israel are performing well while Bulgaria are lower in the table than their recent form|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the dreaded xxx opposite xxx as stopper- 3H from West should show values|pg||
nt|xenya: this may well make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|desinka: hello Panos:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C GF relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: apart from the hcp he has an empty hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south with both majors(though weak) is strangely silent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this also gives you access to Voice Commentary for both rooms in our match|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Good morning all, we just started with the 4th match of the Final|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|ady: it appears the contract n/s is 6@S    not all bid in 1 go|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dzien dobry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Then ???  3NT - Pass???|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: @sA in hand|pg||
nt|xenya: which is likely|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR they led the @SA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and N still dont know what majorsuit S has|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he passed slowly :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  1N=15-17|pg||
nt|rv: this promises to be battle royale, 2 experienced and top sides in good form|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Al|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: its fun to watch my friends play from Canada play the talented Israeli pair|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and why not?|pg||
nt|lml: do you think Stansby should double for a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|lml: is it possible to figure this out?|pg||
nt|ady: north must still think hearts south suit|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps he should get a small bonus for thinking :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol true|pg||
nt|roswolf: t/o dbl of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here we go again RV|pg||

nt|lechcold: witamy naszego vugrafa:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Barel chose the natural option|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is not so clear as a cue bid, not sure the intent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IMPs for Netherlands from carryover of head-to-head match in Round Robin|pg||
nt|gracelin: China is behind by 37 imps but there are 48 boards to go.  So all is not finished yet.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they shouldnt|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a quick defeat likely|pg||
nt|ady: cannot make on any lead    just 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ryskiel_: witam w kolejnym dzisiejszym meczu, ostatnim|pg||
nt|ady: 4@D down 1 on best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bulgaria at the moment in 9th |pg||
nt|ady: must set up 2 heart tricks before clubs are established|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so they would need some VPs to get in the top 8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: "You often have singletons opening 1nt?" asks S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziñ dobry - witam w przedostatniej rundzie RR - dru¿yna polska spotyka siê z reprezentacj¹ Islandii|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't north know it was natural ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok a slow defeat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  weak NT, Strong 1@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: tarzan leaps into the fray|pg||
nt|dgame: hi Rashed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: theoretically this should go one down, 1 heart, 1 spade and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now doomed for 1 down in 5D|pg||
nt|hlortz: pass or correct type bid perhaps with 5@D in reserve if needed|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Traian|pg||
nt|hedyg:  NS CC: http://tinyurl.com/67anzfx|pg||

nt|panosk: gm Pim|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: gm|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   one window per table|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was aggressive|pg||
nt|bobholl: east not feeling to happy now :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphznv: West: i should have passed 2@h when he puts dummy down|pg||
nt|jbgood: so that explains the double:)|pg||
nt|panosk: it was easy that will make it easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3nt could have been a bit difficult to defend against, might need to overtake @C Q and lead a @S through|pg||
nt|olegario: not much can be done, they have gone a bit too high up|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Olegario...welcome|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now the defense is easy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi olegario :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: both sides have great fits   but both limited to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Never says W and laughs|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 2@C shows 5+ @H , 10+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they have screamed for club lead so no chance of anything else|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, seem like a flat board to me|pg||
nt|olegario: Hello skaftij :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a crazy double to me, getting a diamond ruff wont set 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant on its own, he does not know about partners spade ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: K@C out diamond switch and spade ace and again diamond|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi oosman |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS upside down count & attitude   Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|rv: literally and figuratively true:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|jbgood: NS's system card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Australia/edgtton-gosney.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a kib tells me he is only 19|pg||
nt|desinka: seems|pg||
nt|hlortz: i woud have thought south would bid 5@C 2 way bid make or cheap save|pg||
nt|hlortz: best lead!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my point was fredin does not even know one club is cashing|pg||
nt|hlortz: very true|pg||
nt|hlortz: takes @H ruffs to beat 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead should sign post the correct line|pg||
nt|gracelin: surprised that Madala is not bidding at all with 5-4 major and 6 pts.  NS seems to be making 2S|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed patrick but need some imps back early i feel|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe too much wine last night!?|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure, Geoffrey, a most difficlt task, but not hopeless.|pg||
nt|roswolf: so much of this game is momentum thus giving you a feel good factor|pg||
nt|gracelin: however, with clubs not breaking, EW can't make even 1NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I saw him in the bar last night, but he wasn't drinking alcohol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = NF   2@C=a) 10-13, (3)4+@C  b) 14-15, not 55|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't know their ranges but 3 nt is surely too high|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D finesse and @S return.|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: hi  all|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphznv: 4@c showed that N has a 3-5-5-0 hand and minimum|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has described a weak 5530|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as with Round Robin,  all matches in all events playing the same boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2@H = 5@S 4@H  14-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Dennis already entered those explanations|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi jack|pg||

nt|jbgood: 2@h was 8-11, that is why S dared to double 2@s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Baldursson playing quietly in 1NT so first blood to Iceland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Quarter Final & Semi Final matches  96 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: all going swimmingly|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah team discipline is good then maybe just drinking the npc's brand of coffee|pg||
nt|bobholl: after a 12-14 nt they didn't probably discuss that 3@D is to play|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lml: maybe not ... I guess he will still come to 2 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Brink presses on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can ruff 3@C in dummy |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exiting first hand // a gameforce relay bidding here - and an Ice-relay bidding in then open room|pg||
nt|nkgupt: -1 may not be a bad score ...4@s is making i think|pg||
nt|nkgupt: by @c's can be forced only twice|pg||
nt|ady: would be easy with 7-5 to have bid higher   Netherlands might have the edge on this hand getting a plus|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it might but is it biddable with west making a strong noise - doubt it myself but the azurri are a law unto themselves|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec observes "kept EW out of 4@h"|pg||
nt|bobholl: Bas is feeling the pressure already :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: btw the home support for team orange is awesome judging by the messages i receive:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt:  |pg||
nt|ady: only danger for Netherlands  in OR  they some way get to 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: or lose to 170|pg||
nt|roswolf: great hand and this is only bd1 of the SF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||

nt|bobholl: ah ha clarification from a kibitzer pass promised 8-11|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: good save against 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: N's decision to play 3N rather than 4@S with a 4-3-3-3 shape is understandable but quite unlucky|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||

nt|bvdahl:  As Hedy posted earlier. http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ is the link for video|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: hi Ruud and yes indeed Iceland have also bid grand|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can you go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Ruud|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not as they lie, but you could have on Qxx trumps offside|pg||
nt|boedhy:  you cannt draw trumps i think|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah iceland went down after two times trump|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and Iceland went down 1 in the closed room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll back Drijver to make|pg||

nt|ahollan1: including Transnational Teams that started yesterday|pg||

mb|1H|nt|xenya: i wonder how it was made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=natural, one round force     or   2@D Relay ??|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if both USA 1 and USA 2 qualify for the Semi-Finals they have to play against each other|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S suggested too    i'm too tired to think of that on my own|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer accepts 11 tricks // I dont think he should have|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was my fault...so you can blame me :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yet more action on this one|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is not a terrible contract but it wont make here|pg||
nt|szalay: can they bid it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) 0-7 HCP  b) 8+ HCP, 0-1 controls|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Hi Panos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Karen|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: 11 tricks looks ok for e/w|pg||
nt|stoffers: So, Italy has started in great fashion (as usual), but iceland has some work to do|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C probably can't either|pg||
nt|lml: well double dummy you could draw one trump|pg||
nt|lml: and ruff the fourth spade|pg||
nt|xenya: i think both contracts are makeable, DD |pg||
nt|panosk: interesting board competition wise|pg||

nt|santyclz: USA 2 took a big lead in the final boards of last segment, 40+ imps in the last 4 boards.|pg||

mb|4H|nt|skaftij:  2+@C any bal hand (without 5M)?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H is too difficult :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seems straightforward abd they are unlikely to get too high|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i scored the first boardmanualy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2NT = @H raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) 4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D  d) bph/4th seat maybe 1-suit, @D    [Woolsey]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: poor N stuck for a bid|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: welcome back to Veldhoven :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@C making and nothing on elsewhere a triumph|pg||

nt|odysseus69: an alternative route is for East to raise NT - the xxx in clubs suggests a problem which existed|pg||
nt|lml: well we might find out about whether Martel can make 5@C in a minute|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is pretty double dummy but maybe he will find it|pg||
nt|xenya: still the bidding just  might put S |pg||
nt|lml: to make 5@C you draw one round of trump and ruff the fourth spade in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: on the right track|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@H|pg||
nt|desinka: now |pg||
nt|szalay: its academic|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3 level safe for either side.|pg||

nt|ianmcc: should lose @c @d @d @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: south might have bid double |pg||
nt|jbgood: both these pairs play transfers after 1@c .... and some more|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't alert 2@C|pg||
nt|panosk: many advocate 2@D 1st and then double if u have to|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, but with Qx@S .. in vuln..|pg||
nt|desinka: just my thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: or this one> http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Another straight forward auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wijs-muller   playing Tarzan Precision  also reached 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our EW pair play  Ice-Relay  aka  Icelandic Relay|pg||
nt|barnets: trump lead will beat this |pg||
nt|kit: key which suit Levin leads.  If he leads a club, I don't think 3@H will make.  If he leads a diamond, it will make.|pg||
nt|gracelin: still others may want to try 4C Splinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but sensible bridge is the order of the day on most hands if you get some freakish distributions then comes the time for flair and imagination|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok just been told, only non vul, 2 openings are 0-7 at least 4 cards, pass = 8-11|pg||
nt|bobholl: luckily 2.33 just in case :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a little care|pg||
nt|roswolf: you may need the 0.33:)|pg||
nt|ady: could be that declarer expecting heart length with south    |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we are ok now...we hope :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel would pass with the 1-suit @D hand|pg||
nt|panosk: cant see how this can make if no defence error|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: hello|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree 2@D seems beter with this hand |pg||
nt|desinka: now...hard contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: has 6 top tricks needs to develop 1 more|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hard to infer that East can have this hand from EW Convention card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think the % play is two finesses, but I confess I'm not sure|pg||
nt|hantveit: a boring wash on this one|pg||
nt|bobholl: they won't find their @D ruff for -2 i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller doesn't play any hand quickly|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Italy have an excellent record in recent European and World level events, has Dutch beaten them in a long k/o match anytime in recent past?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 32 boards remain today to determine finalist|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: don't think these teams played many Knock Outs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but I suppose the vulnerability was a disincentive|pg||

nt|szalay: good start - for declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: everything breaks normally here but declarer must be prepared for worse scenario.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C lead on this auction seems misguided -- but Nystrom hoped [keyword] to win then seeing dummy have better idea of shift|pg||
nt|ady: I think will start with a club from west|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room less danger for that (n bid 1nt)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was a superior spot'|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: but this, i'm almost certain, won't make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a 2nt bid as at the other table would have helped a lot|pg||
nt|kit: Now may be necessaryi to shift to a trump -- which is normal enough looking at that dummy.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a safe level|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: South checking leads|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@S was an overbid in my opinion|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to be down 2|pg||
nt|kit: In theory declarer can recover by playing a second club cutting communications, then AK of spades dropping the queen, a second trump, and be able to ruff fourth spade.  But that ...|pg||
nt|kit: isn't so likely |pg||
nt|barnets: but now he has the communication|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now declarer can pull trump eliminate @D pitching @S and exit @S|pg||
nt|brgpro: or intra finesse|pg||
nt|brgpro: playing @c to the 7 or 8 then @cQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: intrafinesse first documented in BOLS Tip by Brazil's Gabriel Chagas|pg||
nt|brgpro: now the chance is greater as declarer can discard a @s on the 3rd @d, ( guessing trumps) then exit with a @s|pg||

nt|nkgupt: might hav done a lil better ducking the @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this difference of 12 imps is correct|pg||
nt|santyclz: Woolridge's 2@s bid probably indicated an interest in being higher if n's suit were anything but @ss.  A method that came on the scene responding to CRaSH (and superCRaSH).|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: 3@C would have been easy enough on a heart lead|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 3@H should go down but no so bad as 3@C will make|pg||
nt|josj: good morning Europe and hello all|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Hi Jos|pg||
nt|josj: hi Victor|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I would play on @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: probably thinking of best line for 3 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|kit: which is what he is doing -- remember, he can't see all the cards as we can.|pg||
nt|gracelin: spade to J, then 2 high D and D ruff may be good.  North could ruff the 3rd D to stop overtrick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: Now a likely @H switch as interest was shown by N.|pg||
nt|lml: The auction has helped for sure |pg||
nt|hantveit: impossible to change to dia K, east might have AKQ in hearts and ace double in dia|pg||

nt|josj: but no double so great chance missed by Israel...|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: South I mean|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade jack now covers everything|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final set of Quarter Final match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: SemiFinal matchups depend on how USA teams do|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director just came in to tell that there will be an appeal over a board of the previous set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if BOTH win today  then  one SemiFinal MUST be USA1 vs USA2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the appeal will be after this set|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so in case of a close finish the outcome might me decided after this match|pg||

nt|kit: Now Levin can underlead his club (Weinstein played queen, showing the jack), and third round of trumps defeats the contract.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they must have overcalled 1@s the OR, thus declarer believes W has the points and simply played @c to the Q to go down...or misguess trumps, one of the 2|pg||

nt|xenya: a somewhat off-shape (and off-strength?) 2N opening...|pg||
nt|xenya: led to a boring 3N -- perhaps for the best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller won't play the hand nearly that quickly|pg||
nt|gracelin: didn't north ruff the 3rd D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would expect the chinese to push here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Could not see, to fast, but they made 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i don't know about what board|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That being so, I dont think I have anything more than my 2@H already showed|pg||
nt|roswolf: first blood to team orange|pg||
nt|roswolf: big blood|pg||
nt|rv: Till recently, Bauke Muller was join top with P.O Sundelin in Roland Wald's world-wide ranking of slow players|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes East didn't cue-raise|pg||
nt|panosk: but not unreasonable strech|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||

nt|alnanda: test|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  will be reached by n/s|pg||
nt|ady: e/w do well to play 3NT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: N might have overcalled with QJ10xx and South raised with Axx so Kxx@s also doubtful|pg||
nt|bobholl: true i wouldn't bid it too :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|brgpro: dec. will surely play @cK with E after this bidding|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|lml: David Lindop is thinking how many spades|pg||
nt|desinka: hi David|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assume DBL=4+@S  but some pairs   specify 4/5|pg||
nt|roswolf: south shows where the hcp are|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tricky hand for East - we can see that 3NT is ok, but East can't|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 44 so 3nt makes |pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer responses for the dutch>|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak NT|pg||
nt|ianmcc: will likely be flat|pg||
nt|panosk: dont know what 2@C is, is it maybe stayman?|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h down on the trump break - but N will save if they bid it?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  a very good lead from Brink played this game down with any other lead it will be close|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice splinter|pg||
nt|gracelin: the opening makes it less appealling for EW to bid a slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-3@S|pg||
nt|brgpro: 1@s=t/o double with fewer than 4@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer sjhpwing clubs?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 2 imps on 2 wildish hands|pg||
nt|ady: typical Sementa opening in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: picture West with Jxx in spades for example|pg||
nt|yllon1:  test|pg||
nt|ianmcc: suggest runout, 2 suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desita :)|pg||
nt|desinka: the best one.. but lets see the contract..|pg||
nt|desinka: Hey, Momchil@h|pg||
nt|lechcold: skok Martensa bezkompromisowy, ale mo¿e wepchn¹æ EW w szlemika, którego po³o¿enie wymaga..sami widzicie czego:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but splinter will help Brink declare|pg||
nt|roswolf: light but shapely opening - yes e/w will do well to score game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4-fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room in 4@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, and 5c, but 3nt more likely|pg||
nt|hantveit: shoul make 4s too|pg||
nt|hantveit: should|pg||
nt|bobholl: threy made it indeed|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3h=single H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  my typo   see Jack's explanation|pg||
nt|roswolf: denies 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H is not making but in this vul it is hard for N to let it go|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for both teams still alot at stake|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make 5 here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am assuming he wont risk heart ruff by playing for club ruff|pg||
nt|gracelin: Leaving to their own, 6C is a reasonable contract.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but of course, not making here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: true and making 12 tricks might be iffy|pg||
nt|gracelin: this shud be easy enough and probably 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=blocking|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will X again|pg||
nt|rv: Madala feels it is worth risking 2 level O/C for lead purpose|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess 3@C shows a better hand that could be 2nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert must mean that Hurd could differentiate good/bad hands  via 3@c/2N|pg||
nt|santyclz: Levin is thinking slam thoughts with a  double fit.|pg||
nt|dgame: 16+ HCP any distribution|pg||
nt|panosk: yes been told so club + ather suit, stayman wudnt make any sense in this situation|pg||
nt|panosk: thx all for your suggestions|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||
nt|boedhy:  Brasil strugling to get to the first 8|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South will correct to 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@D not so bad (last hand) but may be a bit tricky due to 4-1 @D|pg||
nt|runnerup: this secvense helps to let 4 @h -make easyly -south has all cards -also 3nt|pg||
nt|xenya: tempting for N to go on|pg||
nt|ady: that really should be penaly now|pg||
nt|santyclz: And controls in both side suits.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this could make, certainly the best spot N/S|pg||

nt|pawel90:  nie poprawiam Rysiu :) - chyba sie nie zrozumielismy :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that won't work|pg||
nt|skaftij:  What a shot!|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and it does go off but not enough perhaps|pg||
nt|gracelin: the lead maybe referred to as Canape lead.  You bid your longer suit but lead your shorter one.|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: welcome back Kit :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is not pure Stayman -- just a relay for more info|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, many play lite O/Cs for lead or sacrifice |pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ok ale ja skorzysta³em z okazji by co podszczypn¹æ - jak to mam (mom?) w zwyczaju|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and they'll win it there probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: folks, try to analyze like the players, not as double dummy :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6NT is on but kind of roland slam :) 20% or so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: great bid by Wooldridge|pg||
nt|yllon1:  3@H shows minors ?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt 20-22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit unlucky  but  Drijver expected better hand from Brink -- and certainly not @HA|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 4@S in open|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Just been given EW CC by a well informed kibitzer: ty Johan|pg||
nt|roswolf: inv raise coming|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: the fit is found|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
nt|panosk: looks it wont make|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The Netherlands offcourse the higher the better because then you get to pick your opps|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they end up in their best fit with good controled bidding it seems. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Muller made 4@S on  2|pg||
nt|ady: this could be very expensive   spade lead and diamond through|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not to be fancied|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd @S enouraging because declarer can duck twice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very creative|pg||
pc|s3|nt|boedhy:  as we can see 4@h is close tho...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and in natural bidding you can end in @h and with 16 opposite 8 think many will be in game...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but a @h lead against 4@h is killing too|pg||
nt|alnanda: yes 4@h is posible altough hard way to make|pg||
nt|ady: that lead wont upset declarer    but any lead likely to be good for south  except maybe a low spade|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Oosman, Jan:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but defense should prevail    overtake  @SQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then @C ruff|pg||

nt|oosmanb: in Usa 2 vs Bulgaria board 2.. 1NT is being played by West!|pg||
nt|andersk: Looks like down, even if he gets the sp right! |pg||
nt|andersk: EW only has to avoid dummy to get entry to the 3rd and 4th sp|pg||
nt|xenya: had N chosen to advance more slowly (5@C?), they might have stopped in 5 |pg||
nt|roswolf: well the usual game try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this won't make either|pg||
nt|brgpro: E still needs to lead @h 8 or 9, otherwise the suit is blocked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hedy --- you're very muffled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy and Peter coming thru well  but not Hedy|pg||
nt|rv: 8 tricks is possibly limit here|pg||
nt|yllon1:  its a hard play but still makeable contract|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think with making 3@d is a good result|pg||
nt|ady: will be enough on best defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the spade switch|pg||
nt|ady: Semenra will do better not to cover the high spades|pg||
nt|ady: diamond from west  devasting   3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a big opportunity for china|pg||
nt|ady: could be around down 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bell tolls for someone|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe east is putting the chilren to bed before commencing the slaughter|pg||
nt|roswolf: children|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Shi had the @SQ in his hand, put it  back|pg||
nt|ady: low spade from east best    but cant expect that|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: the bidding and dummy makes it much clear indeed|pg||

nt|panosk: or maybe it will|pg||
nt|panosk: ?|pg||
nt|panosk: NS need to get a heart as well to defeat|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we have a noted columnist watching  so this could be good one for writeup|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: leader|pg||
nt|roswolf: sementa now regrets opening|pg||
nt|bobholl: another imp for angelini i guess|pg||
nt|hantveit: even if NS is not cashing out, this will probably end with 9 and 1 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially in suit bid & raised   lead high with no honor|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: anybody see anyway to double 4@S?|pg||
nt|lechcold: na drugim stole 4@Sx|pg||
nt|ady: to salvage something|pg||
nt|roswolf: now small spade!?|pg||
nt|ady: low spade now not likely to cost|pg||
nt|ady: west might read the situation if Sementa plays low|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Shi still thinking, alle the cards still open|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Sementa calling director|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 flat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe this pair does allow raise on 3   |pg||
nt|brgpro: just felt funny to see the suit combination though|pg||

nt|roswolf: all hope is not lost yet|pg||
nt|brgpro: .|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably cover to make it unclear which minor Stansby should play next|pg||

nt|lml: well 4@S has one big advantage|pg||
nt|xenya: right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and 4@c has another - @d lead gives 2 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: if Muller had passed 2@s double, could have collected 300|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: they know ... now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||
nt|star6ija: I like Martel's way of bidding|pg||
nt|stoffers: Loosing a couple of diamonds and maybe one spade here, more coffee :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks and 5 imps.|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S not unreasonable contract especially if @DA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking...he placed the cards on the table and deep in thought|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very similar auction to the same poor contract|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: so far canada has been the aggressor and it has worked|pg||
nt|brgpro: hi and hoi|pg||
nt|dgame: need ruff @d twicw|pg||

pc|s6|nt|brgpro: well, will 4@c be forcing in this auction?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen-Verhees play a very unusual system  so when auctions look similar they're usually with very different inferences|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: they stole the contract on board 2 in 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: at least 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|roswolf: what is his complaint - too slow?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the hollanders have a great tradition of winning against the odds|pg||
nt|roswolf: also their squad system and support for the national team deserve some laurels|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good advertisement for the value of playing 2nt as forcing on this sequence.|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: dropping the @HQ may well just be a gut feelinf - madala has flair in abundance|pg||
nt|brgpro: many specs told me that if E has the Q he would be end played but how could he go to dummy again?|pg||
nt|brgpro: the way he played...he had no more entry to dummy|pg||

nt|hantveit: Looks like angelini got a tilt there. Boye is a good partner in thouse situations, I am sure he backs up his partner not. |pg||
nt|hantveit: now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: However they have declared that they frequently bid 3 card @H/@S after 1@c/1@D opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: had they all raised @H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not sure|pg||
nt|brgpro: declarer, knowing the suit breaks 6-3 will surely win the first @h with some hope.....( i mean after @h5 lead)...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: live video and voice commentary from onsite vugraph room http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live|pg||
nt|hantveit: when partner is doing something increddible bad, the best partners is backing him up, the worst are yelling.|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have a (very) good pair on the other table|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H a better slam than 6@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: I am not familiar with NSs system, but in natural 2D is a goo bid on souths han|pg||
nt|hantveit: if partner bids 3D, you say 3S as force, partner can insist on 4D with 4+ dia|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree completely|pg||
nt|hantveit: a@h|pg||
nt|hantveit: great, thank you, it only took me 6 years to learn that|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this big club 1@D bid is NEVER  54 minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S semi-constructive|pg||

nt|rnmalik: routine 4@H again.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||

nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: still 2-0 -- i think it will be a record across the matches on those boards|pg||
nt|lml: I guess double makes sense with four spades and a not great club suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Italy-Netherlands 0-25 on the same 2 boards|pg||

nt|ady: would be unlucky|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Can it be 10-14 NT?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: They play multi when Vul|pg||
nt|santyclz: USA 1's, I mean.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||

nt|barnets: 3@D israel in open|pg||
nt|ady: but 3-0 heart split and needing a club ruff may be too much|pg||
nt|bobholl: luckily it was NV :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes that could be the reason, he could discard a @D on the 4th @h if E had any|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S will depend on the opening lead here|pg||
nt|kit: Levin with a difficult rebid chooses to hedge with 2@D, as neither 2@H nor 3@H feels right.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=not 4/5@S  a) any (mild) INV, no fit  b) to play 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D non-force|pg||
nt|brgpro: where is Rob when we need him?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have notes too :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: the inventor of the Tazan prec. system|pg||

nt|roswolf: tough reopening positon for south basicall opps could have anything|pg||
nt|brgpro: if Duboin doubles this....the best for N is to pass...|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl seems flexible|pg||
nt|brgpro: although i believe he will just shrug and pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lauria 1N East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S game try|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
nt|xenya: more realistic|pg||

nt|ahollan1: bid game try to make it     sorry  very old joke|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescued|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1N 18-20|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D is a spade raise- exactly what this promises varies from partnership to partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East doesn't accept|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so bidding is as displayed, only North doesn't see it yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pushed to North now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North has to decide the final contract now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does 4@H need @s guess or no?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1H showing @ss|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Wijs did not enter with @h bid on bd3, allowing Einarsson to support with 2@s iso 4@s|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
nt|brgpro: assume E has only 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs use transfers over the DBL   showing EITHER  the suit OR  fit with lead-director|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rusinow leads down to 9 showing T|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Same lead in the OR.|pg||
nt|wild card: hi|pg||
nt|wild card: this looks like a makebale contract|pg||

nt|lml: this may work out well for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: pretty aggressive bidding by this team so far|pg||
nt|xenya: and how|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR Weinstein overcalled 2@C instead of doubling|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict some 14 imps to Israel on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: MArtel has found a book|pg||
nt|lml: its a style thing but the club suit looks pretty weak to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and has started reading in it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't pass, but the tray wa spushed to the North side already|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and North bid already and SW saw it when the tray was pulled back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director walked away, i Didn't hear his ruling..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Tray is at WestSouth side now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Think director went to get some help|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nd director here: they said it's more complicated|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the meantime i go for a coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Norths 3@S is treated is as a bid of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: without screens|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East can accept 3@S or let the tray go back to Fredin|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East asking what the total consequences ar|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west passes, north bids 3@s and auction proceeds as normal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west doesn't pass, then if north bid @S's (at any lvl) south has to pass 1 round|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: If west doesn't pass and North bids something else than @S south should pass the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: same here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: china lost 3 imps on bd17 2@S-1 by the chinese south in the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is unlikely to misguess H position now.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south also has a tough lead.  3 Aces and a singleton trump, all unappealling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is either balanced  or   5minor 4Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so were back now..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And we are back live now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and first imps for iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Board 18 was a 4@c down 2 in N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done Jan and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a 4@s making on board 19|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes well done Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Now we are LIVE again - and 2nt showed a 3 or 4 card @s support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice to see some totally natural bidding :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so Sweden are off to a flying start in this match -- very important for them  as they are currently 9th, closely followed by Australia and Japan |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ashley in the tank now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Muller did bid @H:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  5 @s is not easy to make without a @c lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bidding defensive does have downsides too|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer needs to use his high trump to play the red suit.  Club can be led from either hand.  So better win and start a red suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: why not 3!AH |pg||
nt|bobholl: the  1nt is just to play opposite 8-11 so not well defined|pg||
nt|oosmanb: CC says Nonvul TP if pd passed|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So he wants to play 1NT. thats it.|pg||
nt|bobholl: he 'd better lead a @H otherwise made |pg||
nt|ahalim: 5@C reached in the other room is a good contract, with @c 3-1 you can make 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  think this will go down so 8 imps or so to iceland|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and thanks 350 specs for hanging in there with us :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a great start for the "hometeam" |pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes and an important match it is. |pg||
nt|jbennet: An x with void hearts dangerous.|pg||
nt|pbundy: a possibility that the extreme trump break may give declarer a problem here - IF they do indeed declare in 3@H|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 aIh|pg||
nt|hantveit: see, I lost it again|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H would have been much better|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3a@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, forgot about bad spade split -- so slam won't be making anyway -- or will it -- might be a trump coup.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lew Mathe:  NEVER lead trump  ....  unless it is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rusinow =  lead 2nd of touching honors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and found must look up their cc|pg||
nt|rnmalik: game is there 4@H or 3NT.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: selamat siang semua disana dan selamat final:) gm all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: understand 1@S flat positive GF|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like -3|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see the title of it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South annoyed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  there is.....|pg||
nt|boedhy:  strange bidding form south 2@c round forcing|pg||
nt|hantveit: I am slow, but I think I got it now|pg||
nt|hantveit: @C|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah result merchant was he!?|pg||
nt|blewah: Selamat siang Oom Jaap|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi and welcome.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphznv: bulgaria scored 10 on the slam hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: he would rather have seen a redouble:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South to toilet now|pg||
nt|bt: thanks martin|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello Lars yes sweden has picked up a few so far|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 teams qualify for the quarterfinals -- and this is the last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similiar situation here|pg||
nt|kit: scary stop when vul 3NT is so close.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: after Levin put the cards down...North said YOU HAVE SOMETHING :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|ady: have stayed out    have done well   may get a swing|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  well with the odds|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north can only contribute S6 on first trick, south shud know declarer's trumps are all high.|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe Angelini sponsored them as well|pg||
nt|ahalim: operator pls undo|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: here the KJ of clubs are waste paper- |pg||
nt|boedhy:  if you end up 4th you will get the best team form 5-8 as opponent for instance USA1|pg||
nt|bt: so on the pedestrian heart lead decl has 8 tricks, now he has 9|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another potential good board for sweden|pg||
nt|runnerup: this cant be bad for Sweden either|pg||
nt|barnets: exact same bidding in open room|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry not made but you never can tell|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Is @H lead really findable?|pg||
nt|blewah: Hi gary. Hi Rashid|pg||
pc|c7|nt|antoniz: blisko szczêcia|pg||
nt|lechcold: Lall musia³ to co musia³:)|pg||

nt|pawel90:  sam nie wiem. Co ma zrobiÄ S, po wziÄciu na asa trefl?|pg||
nt|antoniz: najpierw musi pucic kiera|pg||
nt|pawel90:  a potem pik do asa i pik|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: ³atwo jest nam...oni na obu osiach maj¹ nielekko, no mo¿e z wyj¹tkiem Kality...da³ harcersk¹ kontrê i siedzi zadowolony|pg||
nt|andersk: @C lead, then If he hooks a @D switch for -1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: interesting on a @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe cullin leads @H|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right |pg||
nt|gracelin: thoug declarer has only 3 obvious loser, he might not have 10 trick since he cannt ruff the 4th D.  North will overruff.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but 3 sP is a choice|pg||
nt|brgpro: i hope he was right each time he led one!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most know the name Mathe because of conventional overcall of strong @C  where DBL=majors NT=minors|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: harus pergi ke final belanda|pg||
nt|blewah: Rashed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: i would have overcalled 1@H with the north hand but pass is ok if your partner is there for you with a double|pg||
nt|kemperg: the only lossing line?|pg||
nt|wild card: yes|pg||
nt|wild card: but now he's down|pg||
nt|jbennet: which is the one recommended.|pg||
nt|kit: All the warning signs are out there -- double of 4@D, no 4@H Q by partner.  Looks like Levin should find the pass.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking...he looks in agony lol|pg||
nt|szalay: Kit we can say TEMPTING signs as well|pg||
nt|szalay: good support, RDBL over DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he placed the cards on the table|pg||
nt|szalay: what was EXACT meaning of 3@H?|pg||
nt|rv: E-W are close to making 4@h, N-S make 9 tricks in 3n, interesting brd here|pg||
nt|yllon1:  a cold contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|stoffers: no problem...sementa found a @d nomather what :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: witam serdecznie|pg||
nt|lechcold: 4@H wychodzi...obrona mo¿e jedynie utrudniæ puszczaj¹c karo|pg||
nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
nt|lechcold: z uwagi na ograniczon¹ liczbê dojæ do sto³u, trzeba jednak rozegraæ bardzo trafnie|pg||
nt|garden2005: czesc Antoni|pg||
nt|lechcold: no nie wiem czy taki zadowolony:)|pg||
nt|ady: could make if hearts with south    9 tricks available    but defence have 5|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they are very friendly at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can switch though, to kill dummy's entry, THAT is findable|pg||
nt|bobholl: but does he suspect a@s single |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Can be pretty certain since with dblton he mightve run from dbl?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however |pg||
nt|oosmanb: what if pd has AJxx|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: he can have that off course :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but a @D a@H and 7 @S = C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: wow ... well done north south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or was it USA lost 10|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you say the name it'd probably turn into a best-seller in a moment :)|pg||
nt|bt: grue had a brain melt in 6@C doubled and lall gave up a second spade finesse, thanks|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry - zwyciêzc¹ konkursu by³ marian 12 anie maciej12|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and passed|pg||
nt|brgpro: a quiet 1 down here...but 1NT will be interesting, |pg||
pc|d6|nt|andersk: no chanse to set now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ? If pd had J@D along with A. then top 4@D and 2@C tricks?|pg||
nt|bobholl: south took a profitable gamble :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: switch K@H and J@d|pg||
nt|kit: I would have to check, but looking at Weinstein's hand I imagine it is a forcing 3@S call.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi aria|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|alnanda: i think 2@c is drury|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be 2@H only showed a minimum but it's strange anyway|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, but it is hard when we do not know the system. But they should be able to find a 4-4 fit in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Angelini found the 13th card on the floor from last game, maybe that is why he threw away the clubs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: although that doesnt even leave 8-11 with East|pg||
nt|rv: this should drift 1 down|pg||
nt|rv: Italy likely to pick-up another 10 IMPs on brd 19|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ron_sc2002: agree.. partner probably wont bid again so better to make pressure on E and bid directly 5@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on heart lead he makes also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller won't go down quickly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: would all of you have got to 6@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tricky too bid|pg||
nt|lml: it sure is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now the live scores is down so hope we get that back soon|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm should be made ok i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, I a, wrong.  Declarer does have 10 tricks.  He can pitach the 4th D on a good club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi sry lost connx|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, I think it can be made, a lot of guessing to do...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Has to pick up 10x of @ss is all, I guess.  Not automatic.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps a simple finesse then xruff pitching dummy's 3rd @s on the @ha.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oosmanb: Best lead is @d probably|pg||
nt|jbennet: would most likely had led to 4 cl for +130.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 18  other table 5@C going down  so 11 for Sweden|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: in 10 minutes or so he will be brought back to cruel reality|pg||
nt|lml: south asked for a heart earlier|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah trying to make it...|pg||
nt|pbundy: no useful pitch - and a ruff high appears to doom the contract also|pg||
nt|pbundy: not to mention some clubs which must be disposed of......|pg||
nt|jbennet: a narrow escape. for -1. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: with the high spade|pg||
nt|yuval10: he saw KJ@d KQ@s in N, K@h can't be with him as well|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: north might have intended 4@C to say "you can save in 5@C if you like"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: some more imps coming up for sweden|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like another 10 |pg||
nt|hantveit: It must be the @c ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is crossruffing like you said:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: an established partnership like the Herbst have it easier because they know what to expect from each other|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh sorry  deWijs declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know EW definition of "semi-construtive"|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a @s back will show that all lines work after w covered.|pg||
nt|panosk: N signals @C i think|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well their is the advatage of being known as a good player......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Versace didn't open West hand|pg||
nt|rv: only 5 since Lauria couldn't manage to find way to make 8 tricks in @h partial|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: @d6 could be singleton or T6|pg||
nt|tez: 3 of @h suit preferance here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so muller now thinking whether he should try to cash a 2nd @d|pg||
nt|rv: Muller can safely play second trump to cater to all scenarios|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but he knows de Wijs only had @h JTxxxx, so @cA also possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver  4@S North|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: played on @S and @H 3/2. |pg||
nt|yuval10: neither can the A@c|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ryskiel_: pewnie uk³¹da tekst przemówienia obroñczego|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Declarer giving up 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: just making|pg||
nt|xenya: down 1 (i don't think he will take a deep @D finesse on the 2nd round) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs may open west hand 1N  [or PASS]|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wild card: but when you try to ruff your diamonds you only need spades 3/2 and diamonds 5/3|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wistuj¹ - jak w "wist rozmowa w tym samym jêzyku" |pg||
nt|lechcold: kontra by³aby sportowa bez pi¹tego trefla, a z nim jako siê broni wg. mnie|pg||
nt|boedhy:  peolpe tend to trsut you|pg||
nt|pbundy: with the spade ace not sitting well, all spells trouble for declarer|pg||
nt|kit: I'm told 3@H is invite+ in spades|pg||
nt|brgpro: say a @c lead and back, S shd just cover E's card...leaving him with no entry in hand ( to play a @s up)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last time i played constructive raises, partner and i defined it as hand that would accept AT LEAST one game try|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: yes, looks like it will be -2 |pg||
nt|roswolf: establish clubs and hold his breath by playing a diamond up|pg||
nt|anton72: looks like 140 and flat board |pg||
nt|rv: 4@s is normal contract here, very enterprising (euphemism for gambling) players  may try 3n:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|antoniz: Piotr myli o singlowym Asie pik|pg||
nt|anton72: sry ..was private |pg||
nt|anton72: but anyway ..Hi Mike ..and thx for the nice job what u doing well !!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 140 looks about right :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: 12 well deserved imps to give Israel the lead|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby @CA sta³...|pg||
nt|jbennet: he might deduce south having 2623 from start|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  [4@HN=]   Fallenius in 2@H|pg||
nt|jbennet: that couldnt have been s surprise.|pg||
nt|pbundy: had he known the layout, a club pitch might have been more opportune|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strongly recommend    buckle up   this will be a bumpy set of boards|pg||
nt|jbennet: the hearts were huge huge favourite to be 4-0.|pg||
nt|hantveit: then it makes more sence, but he must have lost if after the opening...|pg||
nt|rv: well def|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lml: yes it does but Stansby doesnt know that yet|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but Campos now kowes never to trust Brink anymore|pg||
nt|roswolf: another push|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice discards as well, helping partner|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphznv: he did not ruff yet|pg||
nt|jbennet: but on the other hand there is no way to deep finesse in D lacking 1 entry.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|lml: he is about to find out though :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: smalltrue  there was a defence   smalll club at trick 2  possible but difficult|pg||
nt|boedhy:  something i could have told him on beforehand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbennet: in fact it was 99 % sure that hearts were 4-0.|pg||
nt|jbennet: if not then east only possible distributon were 4324|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphznv: claiming losing a @s and a @H|pg||
nt|panosk: what a struggle for a mere 2@S part score|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if he makes it lose 2 imps goes it down 7 imps|pg||
nt|kit: Zagorin ducked the ace of hearts.  Weinstein now working on a trump coup, but won't succeed since third round of diamonds isn't cashing.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbennet: and no sane player would sit for 3 h x with 4-c support in clubs and only xxx in hearts.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|star6ija: @c switch would probably defeat the contract|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room, but South described minor 2-suiter|pg||
nt|lechcold: oj|pg||
mc|9|nt|jbennet: so since j9x is impossible to handle; the issue is play south for EJ or E9.|pg||
nt|runnerup: and no entry to play A9 -so Aj|pg||
nt|jbennet: he might be afraid that south had 2713 from start.|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N had J9x now, the finesse would be essential|pg||
