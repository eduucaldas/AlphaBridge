nt|athene: does the double of 1@S show three hearts, i wonder, or a strong hand?|pg||

pc|c7|nt|danilo1: risky pass by Doris ... but believe - agreement to reopen if @D shorth|pg||
nt|chmitty: what a hand in South after a 1@d opening !|pg||
nt|chmitty: Should she bid 3@d for instance now ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: dificult bidding for South now ... maybe 3@D best showing her hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: 4@s is quite a position in front of a 3rd seat opening|pg||
nt|grebrof: 4@s might be off too|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lebridgeur: there I suspect the bids are Ns bids|pg||
nt|chmitty: depends on how declarer tackles the @s suit|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chmitty: she passed first hand|pg||
nt|danilo1: y ... as expected, 3@D|pg||
nt|chmitty: so Bocchi should not try 3NT probably|pg||
nt|chmitty: but he has a 15 count|pg||
nt|danilo1: since she is passed pd, difficult to expect 2 entries (needed) .. believe Bocchi will work it out and pass|pg||
nt|danilo1: + she must have long @D that are not solid (KQJ) and something aside (did not preempt)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|djneill:  2@d is a common treatment in europe so probably E-W have discussed this delayed 3@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  East is anxious to get that heart lead into the AQ|pg||
nt|chmitty: Classicaly, the x shows 3 @h support OR a strong hand with maybe two cards only|pg||
nt|chmitty: East was asked the question : do you have a @s stopper, and he politely answered|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm i think that might be a bit tricky to handle|pg||
pc|d2|nt|danilo1: thk West could bid 3@S immediately ... but prefered to use - evidently kind of Lebensohl |pg||
nt|chmitty: Catani in 9th place : they badly need a victory against this strong team|pg||
nt|danilo1: but she cannot have 2 Aces ... |pg||
nt|chmitty: good judgment|pg||
nt|danilo1: well done|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chmitty: Can you make this despite the 4-1 @c split ?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@c is long clubs in a 11 15 hcp hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chmitty: I would say no|pg||

nt|athene: i wld prefer double to either show 3 hearts or not :) "probably" or "usually" three hearts not so useful|pg||
nt|chmitty: trying to set 2 good @d (if @d9 was third and not fourth in South's hand)|pg||
nt|chmitty: or build an endplay|pg||
nt|chmitty: after a @c ruff, if declarer can eliminate @d he will have a safe play by playing K@s and finesse @s|pg||

pc|h6|nt|chmitty: the point is : what do you bid with a 19 Hcp balanced hand ? you can't pass so it's whan you have to double with less than a 3 cards support, I believe|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|djneill:  East now can see only risk is losing @dA, 2@s, and a ruff so just draws trumps as quickly as possible|pg||

nt|santyclz: Good morning from the beautiful Poconos.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  the major suits are indeed quality|pg||
nt|grebrof: no, but it CAN be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: 2@S by North is kind of ... Mixed events bridge|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: apparently he can't :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: declarer will probably lose 1@H, 1@S and 1@D .. but no @C :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: on a @s lead, the @d goes away|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  I hesitate to bid 2@s though since South chose not to bid 1@s (or anything for that matter) over X|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. all depends on lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: this trump suit is quite interesting|pg||
nt|queequeg: the open room started right now :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont understand bidding like this - why not just bid @cs or X and then bid @cs|pg||
nt|chmitty: interesting hand to play on a @h lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|barbyh: clubs are well placed for East|pg||
nt|chmitty: 8 only safe tricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: if you know east has the ace, the percentage play is small to king, then duck on|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok North doubles the third time and thankfully South likes this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: CATTANI - BRIDGE BOLOGNA RASTIGNANO  after 3 round is in 9° position with 36 points - Lavazza first with 61 points|pg||
nt|chmitty: On this kind of bidding, lead the most neutral suit is the best - long term - but Saurer tried something else here|pg||
nt|danilo1: believe in @S AQ now (discarding @D)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Dbl and then cuebidding @C would show a different hand/.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not a big success for EW should go done  2|pg||
nt|grebrof: how is a @cbid cue after a dbl?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: duck one|pg||
nt|chmitty: we can see that 3@h is a make so you must defeat 2@s|pg||
nt|chmitty: best lead for defence|pg||
nt|chmitty: South worried by possible @c ruffs|pg||
nt|wstuart: ost pairs play the 2@H bid as natural, although some play 2@H as a "skew" cuebid, showing 4-6 in the other suits.|pg||
nt|chmitty: will you start with @s ? @d ? or @c ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: each has its merits|pg||
nt|chmitty: @s to the K and @d from dummy is probably best|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|athene: that gains against @HAx and @HAxx with east, and loses only to @HAJx|pg||
pc|c9|nt|djneill:  here, count is most important (how many spades will cash), so South will play a low @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: they can open their @c trick, added to 1@h, 1@d and 3@s|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|chmitty: 5 only losers but I believe declarer will run short of trumps too soon|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|chmitty: if @d honors are split you have 9 tricks : 2@h + 2@s + 3@d + @c in due time, without letting North in hand|pg||
nt|grebrof: I got this in latin (not my best subject at school): "memento audere semper" = "Remember to always risk"|pg||
nt|chmitty: here declarer in trouble already|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barbyh: but not enough entries for the second club finesse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: of course it would have been harder after a club lead then three rounds of spades, with west threatening to overruff dummy :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I do not disagree with Berndt ... he cannot lead @D, @S would finess pd and trump gives away tempo ... but I would lead @CQ |pg||
pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|barbyh: perhaps west might have bid 2nt to slow the auction down|pg||
nt|grebrof: thank you "private"|pg||
nt|chmitty: has to decide whether North has Q@s or K@d :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i guess east was going for singleton spade with partner but that was a bit of a long shot i think|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|danilo1: if 11s dble promissed @S .. someting is wrong with EW system ... why should notEast be able to Dble for penalty - and if so agreed, why than West does not Dble instead of 3@D ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: (already promissed 6-cards) bidding 2@D free|pg||
nt|wstuart: I'm not sure how to answer you, Espen.  Think of some auctions where you DBL and then cuebid - it's pretty obvious.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can eventually get to dummy with a diamond ruff and play a heart to the jack, i suppose|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|djneill:  ok so West should probably cash the @dA here because North has at most 1 diamond, it might be the King, but West may think South has all the diamonds, in which case, not cashing the dA is better so as to have the end position better|pg||
nt|djneill:  but for sure, West cannot pick up all the diamonds, North will not have a doubleton on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe the defence will run out of things to lead before that happens|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one down will be a good save against  3@h|pg||

nt|athene: hmmm, i guess 2nt shows a maximum with no major|pg||
nt|black man: probably maggio francisci play ghestem so 2@s is a 2 suites bid: @c @h|pg||
nt|wstuart: regardless of which suits it shows, it is a valid thing for partnerships to discuss what teh potential ranges are for tshi bid.|pg||
nt|grebrof: there we agree completely Wayne :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Bridge is largely about putting partner on a range and a distr and refing the partnership's opinion of how many tricks that will produce.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: another good decision by Lavazza - could dbl giving the minors, but vulnerable isn't a good choice|pg||
nt|athene: not exactly what east wanted to hear|pg||
nt|chmitty: East hoped to play in a 44 major fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: for communication reasons you may win with @h ace and play a small @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm surprised that, if the partnership allows to make a Stayman with this hand, you can rebid to 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is well played with @s 3-2 (3 N), and @d K in S, still has to yield a trick if the @d Hs are split|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz: In 2/1 this hand might have been more fun.  2@c by n, 2@s by s, p p ? (double or let them play?)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|danilo1: looks like missunderstanding ... guess Joanna will now simply bid 3NT|pg||
nt|chmitty: a success for the strong @c here if West leads his top @c unknown in the bidding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|djneill:  not sure what the 2@d is, maybe it is a 3 card heart raise|pg||
nt|danilo1: anything alerted here (North hand is not reverse) ,,, so 2@D bid looks like style in Polish Club ... or eventually Fiori Romano|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ritong: yes, amazing coincidence|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if east decides to lead passively, say a diamond, i suppose you might just cash the @HAK intending to try to set up spades for a club pitch|pg||
nt|danilo1: in Fiori Roano, 2@C was three-suiter .. thk we need some basis for NS system|pg||
nt|chmitty: lollll|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: ok so now i am really puzzled what 2nt meant last hand :) haha|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: probably next 3NT by South ... some work but believe she will bring it home|pg||

nt|athene: well, people do, in practice|pg||
nt|athene: might not be allowed to put it on your convention card tho :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: This bid makes that clear.|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: @D lead not improbable|pg||
nt|chmitty: @c lead immediately brings the 9th trick|pg||
nt|danilo1: believe Berndt wil lead @D or @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: its 2 am here not quite awake|pg||
nt|chmitty: on a @s lead, you must decide to play on @h rather than @c I believe|pg||
nt|chmitty: difficult lead for declarer|pg||
nt|danilo1: wit no clue .. difficult to believe Joanna wil not try double @C finess ... still - lot of thinking now expected - since allso communication problems|pg||
nt|chmitty: well ... you can take in hand and play Ace @h and @h|pg||
nt|chmitty: they will end up in 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: but maybe, South treated her hand as three-suiter|pg||
nt|chmitty: ok with @h 33 or K10 / Q10 doubleton|pg||
nt|chmitty: for players playing a 15-17 NT if they open 1NT the North's hand, they stay there|pg||
nt|chmitty: the North's hand is actually too strong for a 15-17 NT opening|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: say @DQ, @HAK, then if both defenders follow but no @HQ appeared, you would go @SA, spade ruff, @DA, spade ruff, but you need something very good to happen in spades|pg||
nt|chmitty: In French we would say "ils ont été pris avec les doigts dans le pot de confiture"|pg||
nt|ritong: or east, having felt pain with 2NT previous hand, did not want to inflict the same to her pard  very noble|pg||
nt|athene: a slightly odd hand here in that the defence do best to attack declarer's five-card suit, rather than their own :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: "caught with the fingers in the marmelade pot"|pg||
nt|athene: of course if declarer guesses the @SQ she is home anyway|pg||
nt|athene: but if NS don't play clubs fairly soon, she might survive a misguess there|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep but that's against the odds|pg||
nt|wstuart: West deserves to be killed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: @h lead is the 9th trick. 1 1 2 5|pg||

pc|h9|nt|santyclz: And, as expected...|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ryskiel_: in Poland very popular was conventional 1NT in defence bidding, which show 5m+4M|pg||

nt|athene: a good example here of how a 4-4 fit can produce more tricks than a 5-4 or even 6-4 fit|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s looks healthy at that point|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|djneill:  @c is likely to come in if 3-3 or @c honor sing/doub|pg||
nt|chmitty: One solution is to adopt a double relay sequence (2@c limited and 2@d game force) in theses situations|pg||
nt|chmitty: these*|pg||
nt|chmitty: everytime the 2@c bid is "free" (not only after a 1NT rebid from opener) you can use it|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@h isn't automatic, but it gives pd a chance to raise on a borderline hand with 3 card @h supt.|pg||
nt|chmitty: must show @h as well, I would say from West's action !!|pg||
nt|chmitty: a matter for discussion in the partnership : if you can x 4@s with the North's hand, then South has to bid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chmitty: there it sould go : North 2@c, South 2@d (forced) North 2@h : around 10 Hcp with 5@h|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chmitty: A quite good 7@s : you make 13 tricks in the 44 fit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chmitty: very remote possiblites|pg||
nt|chmitty: double finesse K10 @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: plus some endplay in @c|pg||
nt|wstuart: South has to keep the bidding open since N might actually have something (which he doesn't) and @H might be the right strain.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|chmitty: think about it : of course it has a few inconvenients, but so many advantages :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: When @s are 32|pg||
nt|athene: yes, pretty much needs 3-2 spades or stiff jack|pg||
nt|athene: if you cash the @SAK and east shows out, you can pick them up, but it's no use|pg||
nt|chmitty: more classicaly, North can pass or bid 4NT |pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree|pg||
mc|10|nt|djneill:  since West led 4th best @s, probably West has no other 4crd suit so no point to finessing round 1 I think|pg||
nt|athene: because you can't get a ruff in either hand for the thirteenth trick|pg||
nt|athene: of course it's a good job north is playing 7@S :) otherwise lightner double would be quite effective|pg||
nt|chmitty: Very tough bidding exercice with  natural methods : when you have discovered a @h fit, you hardly can investigate an alternative one in @s|pg||

nt|djneill:  North should double this one|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: now lauria will double i guess rather than bidding 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: better to get the four spades into it rather than just the sixth heart|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure .. interesting is 2@D range ... may stop in 2NT|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|djneill:  ok if 2@d is multi, perhaps North cannot double 2@s since that would be takeout|pg||
nt|santyclz: Assuming the overall hand's entries permit.  If you need to conserve dummy entries, you don't give up too much playing ak.|pg||
nt|athene: most would raise spades with that south hand i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: trickingmW to lead @hs is seldom a good idw|pg||
mb|5D|nt|danilo1: rather believe 2@D is strong balanced|pg||
nt|ritong: other side of the ocean, for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt played by west would be interesting; might make on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you might get there if you opened 1nt with west, but still not all that likely|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ritong: 2@d if allowed|pg||
nt|black man: canape opening in classic roman @c|pg||
nt|grebrof: as I said,bidding 2@h was "not obvious"|pg||
nt|chmitty: conservative pass by East here|pg||
nt|chmitty: why not bid @s ?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|danilo1: all for Dble?|pg||
nt|grebrof: or dbl neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: needs a club lead to beat 6@D, otherwise a club goes on a heart|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely just bid 3nt now to end the auction though|pg||
nt|djneill:  brd 21, system allowed easy stop in 2@c and West chose not to compete to 2@s|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: NS play canape style   shortest suit first|pg||
nt|black man: 2@d natural weak max 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: of course, if this is your method|pg||
mb|d|nt|queequeg: the operator corrected the result|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a bad 6@h here. |pg||
nt|chmitty: ty Daniela @h|pg||
nt|athene: north knows right away after 2@D that EW can make a lot of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: lauria's hand has severely decreased for defending, but 5@d might cost too much|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm with Bocchi :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: I wonder what a 2nt opening would have shown.|pg||
nt|athene: but he is a bit too balanced to consider 5@d sac at love all - maybe at favourable it would be another matter|pg||
nt|chmitty: that is, to me, an impossible bid : pass 1@h and then double 3 ... |pg||
nt|chmitty: you may pass 1@h if you have a penalty double in @h, and then double at the 3 level of course|pg||
nt|chmitty: but West knows it can't be the case|pg||
nt|chmitty: with his @h holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: if @h are 2-2 : 12 easy tricks, if not you must have some good news in the @c suit, or finesse the @s K|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, if Joanna is goung to bid 1NT - me too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess he bids 3@D hoping east will bid 3@S with good values and west won't know if that is invitational|pg||
nt|black man: in this situation, N/S loss @h fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, I dont agree with 3@h either - for me that is preemtive, but I have to say I have no clue about their sstem|pg||
pc|h3|nt|djneill:  2@c lost me|pg||
nt|grebrof: earlier N opened 1@d with 98xx and AQTxx in @hs - I cant see that it is winning bridge in the long run|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: 4@D would surely just induce 4@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chmitty: but defence may force you to an eraly choice by leading or playing @s early|pg||
nt|chmitty: early*|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|djneill:  slam on the @d situation|pg||
nt|athene: but basically you don't expect to talk the opponents out of their birthright on this hand :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  even 4@s|pg||

nt|grebrof: lets face it....|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: yes, your only long suit is 4 cards in openers's suit and not much strength|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  only 3 game bids in 9 boards, hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 7@D is more or less on the club finesse|pg||

nt|barbyh: haha|pg||
nt|chmitty: strong club|pg||
nt|toniemme: afyer the agction in other room this lineof play is possible because south overcall with doble and north show weak hand..|pg||
mb|d|nt|djneill:  3@s good @h raise|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: looking on this now he should pass|pg||
nt|bebechira: seams reasonable to open with how many aces you have|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 kings not good|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no aces no opening bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: meanwhile calandra piling up the imps|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: 3nt not much fun here on a heart lead, but you might be forced to take the double club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: it's OK to double 2@D just to show cards, but you need to know what your next double means|pg||
nt|athene: opps are sure to bid something in a major|pg||
nt|athene: so when you double THAT, is it penalty or takeout? and is pass forcing?|pg||
nt|danilo1: no entries for North so no problem in probable 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: contract  will be 5@h|pg||

nt|black man: undo?|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: Canape ... even if I have it in system, not sure I would open 1@H here :)|pg||
nt|athene: west can set diamonds and ask for keycards then the @CK, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: and stop when it's missing|pg||
nt|chmitty: yes ... I doubt Bocchi will produce the @sJ lead :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|ritong: apparently west has a doubt about 3@d being forcing  tha's quite amazing|pg||
nt|athene: well, if you don't want to bid 3@D, how about 4@D?|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, west can bid 4nt now, if that is blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S might be a reasonable spot, but hard to get there|pg||
nt|djneill:  so South's Pass may have been forcing since North showed a strong game hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  if so North is encouraged to bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: over 4@S, I would surely bid 5@H here (would not be in same situation - as said before)|pg||

nt|grebrof: have to be majors|pg||
nt|black man: no they open 1@c|pg||
nt|grebrof: or a psyche|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  this will be entertaining now|pg||
nt|chmitty: West will be delighted to hear the 2@d rebid|pg||
mb|2H|nt|djneill:  redouble probably shows some 2-suited hand?  2@c to play if one of those is @c?|pg||
nt|djneill:  South's Pass was strong so North will double this surely|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 sp must be sp and clubs|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no aces, no game Mr Savelli..|pg||
nt|ritong: which is not wishable|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: same contract inthis other room by different routes|pg||
nt|grebrof: S seems to be leading @hs, but @s must be better in isolation|pg||
nt|chmitty: and East will be delighted to hear the 2@h bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|djneill:  hm maybe XX was 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bebechira: they could have tried 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: this may be nice swing ... NS are mayking 4@S/@H and 3NT is unbeatable|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: What will Lauria bid now ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: in front of 5@s + 4@c|pg||

nt|ritong: these situations are a huge source of accidents|pg||

nt|chmitty: Henri is right : this is our French standard ... might be different here|pg||
nt|rodal f: U never can be shure. What if Fornaciari bid well at this board?|pg||
