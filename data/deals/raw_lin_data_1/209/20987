mb|4C|nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: so a few imps for some overtricks on Board 1|pg||

mb|4D|nt|vugraphznx: Hi Kath|pg||

mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  Hi Mike, any news on the ruling from the last set? Julian|pg||
nt|mamos: an aggressive t/o double from East |pg||
nt|mamos: as we would expect|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: director called|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 1@h not alerted |pg||
nt|vugraphztt: W alerted it is txf|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hlortz: here we had a pretty routine texas to 4@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North sure to come again|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c showed @s & @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this inv migth lead -to 4 @h -2 if they find ! ruff|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS will just see how many of their "winners" will cash|pg||
nt|westjava: good save in 5@D|pg||
nt|mug: correction direct from Aylesbury on that point, Barry's giving them time off to watch the match|pg||
nt|grebrof: mostly for kids, but someone never grow up - guilty|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: when playing @hQ Leenhardt played cQ instead of @hj|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: Sally Brock's 2NT shows a good @S raise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H i mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with 4+ in @H|pg||
nt|farfie: un solide 4@h|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hlortz: just overtricks at stake - time to get some tea :)|pg||
nt|mug: Heather might have reopened with a take-out double here|pg||
nt|farfie: 11 levées sur la place du roi de @d|pg||
pc|c3|nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: boyd estimates that his shape is more adapted to a suit contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: this looks pretty difficult to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S losers and can only afford 1 @C loser|pg||
nt|ahalim: can prubaly make on an endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: run the @c 9 after eliminating @s and @d looks best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can maybe eliminate @S and @D |pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room Dhondy led J@C |pg||
nt|grebrof: Q of h!?|pg||
nt|grebrof: no|pg||
nt|ritong: he might even finesse @d 9, for the fun|pg||
pc|h2|nt|alnanda: 1S LOSSER DISCRAD WITH q@D|pg||
nt|mug: 2NT was minors, also fairly reasonable but swapping plus for minus|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: at some point in the game|pg||
nt|mamos: several specs ask about the ruling from the last set   does anyone onsite know the outcome|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Heather too busy but everyone bids more than me|pg||
nt|mug: lucky not to be bigger minus, both South and North might have got hold of 3@D|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|don_kapu: what a brave bidding|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but 3nt look like will make|pg||
nt|grebrof: whe n your P opens and you have a 6  card mjor suit, I find no defense not bidding them at the 3 level  - esprcialy holding the A|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|mug: Nevena would have left a double in, 2@S is one off|pg||
pc|d4|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
nt|szalay: 2 or 3 off|pg||
nt|henryb:  This seems to be down 2 |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahalim: but decl might place the @CK with W because of the overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the discard doesnt do much good except aid the elimination|pg||
nt|ritong: really|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mug: but I can imagine Heather feeling that defending doubled partials was not the way to go at the score|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT a more attractive spot than 3D - perhaps pass by East was better option|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yorkbeach:  system card for EW http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
nt|mamos: Club lead will allow trump promotion|pg||
nt|szalay: more likely 3|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe + 1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|alnanda: lead @s big problem for declerer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I know i would go down, let's see if Nicola Smith can make it|pg||

mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: why would you do that unless you see all the cards?|pg||

nt|westjava: we call it BMS (Bridge Masuk Sekolah = gridge goes to school)|pg||
nt|westjava: *bridge|pg||
nt|rmb1: South must have something for her double: so North could play a trump to @HA|pg||
nt|mug: but ace was correct, no reason for North to lead away from @DK on this bidding|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mamos: but the Club ruff might|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: West has to hod her cards up and of course not fly with q of diamonds- oops|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ahalim: but can discard @H on the @D|pg||
nt|alnanda: other room NS play 3 NT make +400|pg||

nt|ahalim: made in the end :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello|pg||
nt|mug: so noone has anything in the locker, just 13 more board of bridge, we think Arifin?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H from West? |pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@S C turned back to 4@S + 2 |pg||
nt|szalay: btw 2nd trump by South instead of @C wd be stronger defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: this was black start from n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: commentator please|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes tricky - because if North bids clubs strongly, NS are likely to finish in 5@c rather than 4@h|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos: in the OR the Indonesians played the first three tricks in the way needed to defeat  -- but then West continued Spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: that|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H not exactly classical with four spades on the side, but what do you suggest?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|szalay: practice 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: this kind of hand generates a lot of accidents|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: here normal handling in 1s lead to 12 tricks in @h (or nt ,but that is wrong contract)|pg||
nt|hlortz: well suit quality of weak 2's has gone down over the years|pg||
nt|wstuart: A common treatment is to play 4@S as a strong single suited hand after a weak 2 opening.|pg||
nt|henryb:  A not unreasonable 3N for N-S, needing mostly the heart finesse, which is offside|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hlortz: martel will likely buy it for 4@S -1|pg||
nt|wstuart: That looks likely.|pg||
nt|ritong: it is really good looking, for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: but the obvious danger is to drive too high|pg||
nt|henryb:  X = 3 card heart support|pg||
nt|farfie: bonne idée de Guy Lasserre,ce contre d'entame|pg||
nt|jjsb2: bonjour tout le monde :) |pg||
nt|farfie: bonsoir Sylvain|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: in @s|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and all pass for 2@S|pg||
nt|ahalim: only half an imp extra for England, which the program cannot show|pg||
nt|jjsb2: c'est docn parti pour une mi temps probablement haletante et pleine de rebondissement ! |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: an excellent bid of 3NT, some players would double but you don't really want to heart partner bid clubs, let alone diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok for me but I bet that there will be some 4H bidders|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok turned back to 5@S +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: io so cape maklum lah ....... kondisi begini yang kuat stamina yang bisa main bagus ,tapi sama2 US juga pasti so cape |pg||
nt|ahalim: omg a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not always nice to play in a 3-3 fit |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if EW had bid and raised @d, East might lead the @d2 as suit preference|pg||
nt|ritong: so, as long as pard is not a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: my policy with these is to take low road|pg||
nt|farfie: l'entame "naturelle" à !k donne une surlevée|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mug: declarer should cash @CA at trick two, plain sailing from there|pg||
nt|ahalim: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=SF&qtournid=886|pg||
nt|jjsb2: en passant un grand bravo aux femmes qui ont gagne la competition "venice cup" à 16 donnes de la fin |pg||
nt|jjsb2: bref ... :)|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ici lasserre a cotnre 3@h est donc poizat est normalement obeissant |pg||
pc|c9|nt|runnerup: partner opened and you had 19 hcp -may lead to slam|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphznx: will have to put in the scores manually|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a more straightforward make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting choice by declarer in the @h suit|pg||
nt|ritong: surprising choice|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps the support double more or less infers long opening suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  rather than 2N?|pg||
nt|ritong: or double|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|wstuart: Not much to te play on this one I think.|pg||
nt|ahalim: for people who are interested in the score per session of this match|pg||
nt|farfie: bonne nouvelle:5imps tombent dans notre escarcelle |pg||
nt|jjsb2: le cotnrat n''est pas tres claire a joue , les communications sont un peu bizarre |pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphznx: + 2?|pg||
nt|ritong: sticking to hcp|pg||
pc|d8|nt|runnerup: @d was missed by ew -but it can happen in many secvenses -|pg||
nt|yo_yo: happens a lot when 1NT forcing and west is forced to rebid longest minor|pg||
nt|mamos: easier for us of course because we know Spade honours onside|pg||
nt|blewah: hi Pak Arifin. is this the official score?|pg||
nt|mug: Smith made the maximum in the CR, so declarer has to pin the @S10 or manage some kind of endplay to flatten the board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now should start spades from dummy or Ace and small spade|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps @DK next to guarantee the contract?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes Q of spades works but swop Ace of diamonds and spade king and a bad idea|pg||
nt|ritong: for once:)|pg||
nt|ritong: meaning " i want to stay in, but no clear path"|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lontoh 63: don't know how many degree on there but though cold now|pg||
nt|mamos: but looks like making even if declarer loses a trump a Heart and a Club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to decipher the NS leads - presumably declarer knew the @hQ was offside|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|farfie: plus que 8 points à refaire|pg||
nt|farfie: le déclarant n'est pas arrivé...|pg||
nt|jjsb2: en fait j'ai tendance a pense , peut etre a tort, que le coup ne gagne pas |pg||
nt|jjsb2: le meilleur jeu est peut etre pour le declarant de jouer R de T |pg||
nt|jjsb2: mais 1) ke ne trouve pas ca naturel et 2 je ne pense pas que cela suffise |pg||
nt|farfie: oui ça coupe les communications|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on me dit que R de T permet de gagner j'ai perso un gros dotue|pg||
nt|jjsb2: si on duque le R notamment |pg||
nt|farfie: certes|pg||
nt|farfie: en tous cas,jolie initiative de Guy Lasserre ce contre|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|vugraphznx: It's about 20 degrees Celsius in here :)|pg||

nt|farfie: Aie!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: how do you like that, stevie?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: East might have bid 2@D though|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: now presumably a @d and a trump up|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|runnerup: all boards have been flat so far |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 81-66 is the score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you have opened arifin?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2 imps missing for Indonesia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit weak for me to open|pg||
nt|ahalim: with West;s cards ? No|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they seem to lead the 9 from Q-10-9 - zero or two higher leads|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|grebrof: I rarely seem my P open 2! with such week @h and no distribution - also - dbl with no tricks in trumps I have seen many disastres|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: cant avoid heart ruff now - had to play 3rd heart before trumps|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|don_kapu: if @S win and return @H will make -1|pg||
nt|szalay: another imp for US|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: rehi|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@C forced 2@d|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|szalay: happily undoubled|pg||
nt|jjsb2: il est peut etre possible d'intervenir a  cette vulnerabilite avec la main d'Est egalement |pg||
nt|farfie: je pence que Philippe Poizat aurait du intervenir à @d dans cette position de vulnérabilité...il doit se reprocher le coup précédent|pg||
nt|farfie: pense|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ici pour le coup comme on peut tous le coir 3@h ne joue pas "tres bien" |pg||
nt|jjsb2: je suis d'accord dominique |pg||
pc|cT|nt|yo_yo: Now West opens her 10 count and |pg||
nt|ritong: this @h 7 seems to come from blank suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|runnerup: 3 @h could have and would have been -2 ,but not a place to pass for west -very difficult place |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I think he will finesse in @d|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not really|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: S then must have had @hA|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but it would create a 2nd entry to dummy|pg||
nt|westjava: will they reach to 6?|pg||
nt|hlortz: cue bids here...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@C is likely a control bid in that suit, however, it may show a min range in HCP;  they may play a serious 3NT which would show more HCP and then let opener continue the auction.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahalim: evrybody starts bidding :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 11 seems a lot of tricks in OR|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on me dit que l'enchere de 3@h est "douteuse" ... je suis aussi d'accord |pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: when it s not a possible fourth best|pg||
nt|ritong: however, it can be a "forced" lead, so Q87 remains possible|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West will regret opening in a minute|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3@H was likely an ask for further description.|pg||
nt|ahalim: remember the Dutch ladies won the venice cup by 0,5 imp some years ago in bermuda|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ritong: forced lead means that east might have @ss or @cs and be unwilling to lead in opponent's suit|pg||

nt|mamos: 10 tricks for West|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: not very many imps chances in this either -all thougth lead gave extra trick |pg||

nt|odysseus69: think she lost 2 hearts 1 spade and 1 club|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: i believe Stockdale said wrong card|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and nicola will bid  what|pg||
nt|jjsb2: avec des adversaires parlant autant peut etre allons nous echapper a ce cotnrat de 3Sa mort ne ? |pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: once North flew with heart ace there was 9 tricks|pg||
nt|alnanda: lost 2@h, 1@s,1@c and ruff @d|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now the road to 6@H or 6@S is opened wide after a 4@D bidding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: X might indicate @H suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dgame: 7@d for -5|pg||
nt|szalay: another boring game, 5@Cx=500|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 150 looks very normal here|pg||
nt|alnanda: 7@d :) ??|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: alternate option was stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: but sporty|pg||
mb|p|nt|alnanda: -6|pg||
nt|grebrof: french people are strange Henri - you always wear brown scarfs :D|pg||
nt|henryb:  The French N-S assayed 3N on board 4, goung down 2 when the heart was offsude|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on m'envoie 100 messages me disant que c'est obligatoire .. je n'en doute pas ... |pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: e did not open in OR so 4@S escaped w/o X|pg||
nt|wstuart: -2 looks about right here.|pg||
nt|ritong: stayman followed with 2@s is an invite for them i think  north a bit short|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: only 6 down|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|alnanda: for 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maximum 6 down = 1400|pg||
nt|mug: very aggressive upgrade by Heather Dhondy, the five-card suit is good but the stiff A-K not so good|pg||
nt|mug: decent contract but the minors lie badly |pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and we have bread under our arm all the time|pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
nt|jjsb2: piganeau l'a egalement faite pour info |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahalim: this bidding is truly worthclass level|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who will Nicola play for @D?|pg||
nt|hlortz: maybe -1...|pg||
nt|wstuart: so likely 5 IMPs back to USA2|pg||
nt|hlortz: k@C shed a @H?|pg||
nt|hlortz: look @@ the interesting @D spots :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|westjava: Tueje finess @CQ at other room|pg||

nt|runnerup: some overbid  -but that happens -even 4 @s is down - also 5 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: E deeply in thought|pg||
nt|mamos: The English NS pushed EW uncomfortably high here but 5@S made seems like a push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in the OR NS competed to the 5-level at the favourable vul but EW judged successfully to bid 5@s|pg||
nt|anton72: need a minor shift now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahalim: when E shows up with the @S A, Nicola will guess the @D;s I think|pg||
nt|grebrof: you make good bread thou . almost as good as the danish|pg||
pc|c3|nt|blewah: @d return to force a guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: WEst made a vulnerable bid so is maybe favoute to have ace|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup: in 4 @s defence should be like @h  lead -@s to Ace and @c .to beat it|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahalim: worlclass|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on shapely deals like this, having more aces is important|pg||
nt|mug: not sure this was good for the defence|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahalim: Ok next board please|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes WD nicola|pg||
nt|blewah: well done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the OR  Dhondy led A@D  so no guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nicola will claim when the next lead isnt ruffed|pg||
nt|ritong: with @h K on he will lose three trumps and basta|pg||
nt|ritong: at most|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahalim: this can make if you guess everything right|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|anton72: double dummy say ...yes ..:)|pg||

nt|mug: clubs was always likely to be declarer's suit|pg||
nt|anton72: still -1|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d3|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 2 aces to come and make all 6 trumps on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: so still a long way to go in this match 10 more boards here and 16 more in the final stanza - with the teams turning over between three and four imps a board still very much ...|pg||
nt|mamos: anyone's match|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 3Sa a l'autre table pour info , entame @s |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wstuart: Looks like the @D spots are going to get crushed out and he will only lose 3 @D tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blewah: not an obvious shift but that's the weakest suit on the table|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mug: I think a spade back might have been logical, to kill entries to dummy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|grebrof: not being able to opening 1nt with 5card major, will in many times give you rebid problems|pg||
nt|jjsb2: qui devrait etre a -1 ou moins 2 selon qu'on mette le V de @s ou pas |pg||
pc|d6|pc|h6|nt|anton72: she can guess 4 cards in partner and i am agree ...diamond looks more normal not J @c|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dgame: 2 imps|pg||
nt|wstuart: After the Q to the K and teh J to the A, he will have to guess whether the 8 or the T is coming down next.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphznx: she cashed some diamonds first|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s5|pc|hK|nt|westjava: foult to setup @D|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|blewah: W can have 3334m|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: same auction in the OR :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will dewi open this one, i guess so if she opened the other|pg||
nt|ritong: well, in truth the number of cards in other major is a factor|pg||
nt|ritong: but too long to develop  next:)|pg||
nt|ritong: we won t know if poizat would open 1NT, because chambers will be in, but i think he would|pg||
nt|jjsb2: a l'autre table on a mis le V mais la defense est toujours en controle pour faire chuter |pg||
mb|p|nt|alnanda: of course worldclass, if not, they could not enter semifinals|pg||
nt|hlortz: restricted choice no?  10/8 or 10/7 twice as likely as 87 ??|pg||
mb|2S|nt|alnanda: :) :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@s look routine for NS on 7|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h or a preemptive 3@h?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yo_yo: ah not this time|pg||
nt|hlortz: as yes as kib says when 7 falls they are equivalent...|pg||
nt|ritong: i would try a semi psych 1Nt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yorkbeach:  3Nt makeable too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even if South bids only 2@s, North should find another bid|pg||
nt|ahalim: slam time now|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: not so sure about world class - 7D was worth an imp - but scary if 2 defensive club tricks available|pg||
nt|ahalim: you mean semi-finals of Venice Cup ! Not semi-finals in Depok yes|pg||
nt|hlortz: eh walter 'big train' is feeding me all the good answers i cofess |pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c puppet stayman|pg||
nt|szalay: its a blackwood hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: perfect fitting hands- can they reach slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|buddyshah: Running scores  for  2nd round    Results /|pg||
nt|buddyshah: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=884|pg||
nt|szalay: no doubt 3@H was invitational|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wstuart: Luckily, N doesn't have the @DT or he might go -2.|pg||
nt|mug: she could have set up the long club I suppose|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@d must be showing 1 or 2 4card M|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea is, of course it gobbles up way less space, but situation is less clear for the opponents|pg||
nt|ritong: here, anything goes as we can see|pg||
nt|ritong: when the NS nine cards fit is disclosed|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahalim: but who can argue with success Victor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT = a good raise|pg||
nt|blewah: 2nt mixed raise i think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D - 1 or 2 4 card majors|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, some think its important to have 5-3 in the majors for allowing opening 1nt, but I haven see the problem to frequent I actually consider it|pg||
nt|farfie: bon,retour de quelques points,nous sommes à moins d'un swing|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 3Sa aurait probablement assez bien joue |pg||
nt|jjsb2: 5@c ou 5@d sera bien plus delicat |pg||
nt|farfie: il devrait redire 4sa|pg||
nt|farfie: négatif|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wstuart: A @D lead will beat it 2 by force, but that's going to be hard to do.|pg||
nt|mamos: looks a comfortable make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unless trumps are 5-0, declarer can count 10 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4D - game only - both majors|pg||
nt|ahalim: after E opened 2NT quite possible to reach slam|pg||
nt|mug: but then North plays a diamond and she loses three clubs, a diamond and a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Senior had 6@D in her hand but back again....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the delay suggests I am wrong or is Neveena just excited by her super max|pg||

nt|farfie: ça c'est inattendu|pg||
pc|s8|nt|farfie: la pression c'est pour tout le monde|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|dgame: i have a queation: where does the score (31-16) come from?|pg||
nt|mug: phew|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 @h went down by wrong guess in @s -board 6 -so Monaco got 13 insteat of Zeerob rood |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: vice versa|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe the delay was checking the system|pg||
nt|blewah: 9 control hand, not very often you have|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: 3@h often includes a shortness  nice hit by chambers|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jaker: 10 imps back|pg||
nt|westjava: plus carry over|pg||
pc|c9|nt|odysseus69: click on movies for board by board imps|pg||
nt|dgame: ok tks|pg||

nt|blewah: play will be very quick|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ritong: mais...|pg||
nt|ritong: oups|pg||
nt|grebrof: another reason is that we are conventional over the transfer in Norway so we do sometimes miss a 5-3 fit in the other major - with a GF hand at the responders hand I do have the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: perfect systtem for you  - lots of relays thou|pg||
nt|ritong: so, the contract looks bulletproof, so boyd tries to consider the worst which might happen|pg||
nt|ritong: and see if there are countermeasures possible in that (rare) case|pg||
nt|ritong: also, he has trouble cashing the @h trick|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahalim: Dgame in Java we say keri oper|pg||

nt|runnerup: yes vice versa ..:) -ok you all got the point anyway -6 @h in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: now there are some problems to get to  the 4th @c|pg||
nt|runnerup: here ew  can make some 3 @c -but not so easy to come in |pg||
nt|henryb:  that may have been the only lead to let declarer come home|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mug: I think West's bidding was simply choice of game, no slam interest|pg||
nt|anton72: other room stop in 4 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and claim|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think that the @c-cut still is the best optiom|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mug: perhaps 4@C would have been both majors and a slam-try|pg||
pc|c4|nt|buddyshah: not a @H discard|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: W doesn t think N has 4@hs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: defence need to play diamonds before 4th spade established|pg||

nt|mug: but North's out of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn:  certainly jack of spades ducked, heart to the ten, diamond ruff, ace of spades, spade will work|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted - missed by me- and being bombarded by better analysts|pg||
nt|dburn:  but I don't think anyone would play like that|pg||
nt|mug: that doesn't rely on doubleton @C9 but does need spade 3-3|pg||
