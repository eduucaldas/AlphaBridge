mb|4C|nt|danilo1: risky pass by Doris ... but believe - agreement to reopen if @D shorth|pg||
nt|chmitty: what a hand in South after a 1@d opening !|pg||
nt|chmitty: Should she bid 3@d for instance now ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: dificult bidding for South now ... maybe 3@D best showing her hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: 4@s is quite a position in front of a 3rd seat opening|pg||
nt|grebrof: 4@s might be off too|pg||
nt|chmitty: if you do ... one off|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: there I suspect the bids are Ns bids|pg||
nt|chmitty: depends on how declarer tackles the @s suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chmitty: she passed first hand|pg||
nt|danilo1: y ... as expected, 3@D|pg||
nt|chmitty: so Bocchi should not try 3NT probably|pg||
nt|chmitty: but he has a 15 count|pg||
nt|danilo1: since she is passed pd, difficult to expect 2 entries (needed) .. believe Bocchi will work it out and pass|pg||
nt|danilo1: + she must have long @D that are not solid (KQJ) and something aside (did not preempt)|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  2@d is a common treatment in europe so probably E-W have discussed this delayed 3@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  East is anxious to get that heart lead into the AQ|pg||
nt|chmitty: Classicaly, the x shows 3 @h support OR a strong hand with maybe two cards only|pg||
nt|chmitty: East was asked the question : do you have a @s stopper, and he politely answered|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm i think that might be a bit tricky to handle|pg||
nt|chmitty: just a guess of who has the 4 trumps, if anyone :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|danilo1: thk West could bid 3@S immediately ... but prefered to use - evidently kind of Lebensohl |pg||

nt|danilo1: but she cannot have 2 Aces ... |pg||

mb|p|nt|chmitty: Can you make this despite the 4-1 @c split ?|pg||

nt|santyclz: 50% slam for most folks.  About 10% for me.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|djneill:  East now can see only risk is losing @dA, 2@s, and a ruff so just draws trumps as quickly as possible|pg||

nt|chmitty: on a @s lead, the @d goes away|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@H could have been a 3-card raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  I hesitate to bid 2@s though since South chose not to bid 1@s (or anything for that matter) over X|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. all depends on lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: this trump suit is quite interesting|pg||
nt|queequeg: the open room started right now :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|barbyh: clubs are well placed for East|pg||
nt|chmitty: 8 only safe tricks|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: if you know east has the ace, the percentage play is small to king, then duck on|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok North doubles the third time and thankfully South likes this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: CATTANI - BRIDGE BOLOGNA RASTIGNANO  after 3 round is in 9° position with 36 points - Lavazza first with 61 points|pg||
nt|chmitty: On this kind of bidding, lead the most neutral suit is the best - long term - but Saurer tried something else here|pg||
nt|danilo1: believe in @S AQ now (discarding @D)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Dbl and then cuebidding @C would show a different hand/.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: not a big success for EW should go done  2|pg||
nt|grebrof: how is a @cbid cue after a dbl?|pg||
nt|bardo: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: duck one|pg||
nt|chmitty: we can see that 3@h is a make so you must defeat 2@s|pg||
nt|chmitty: best lead for defence|pg||
nt|chmitty: South worried by possible @c ruffs|pg||
nt|wstuart: ost pairs play the 2@H bid as natural, although some play 2@H as a "skew" cuebid, showing 4-6 in the other suits.|pg||
nt|chmitty: will you start with @s ? @d ? or @c ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: each has its merits|pg||
nt|chmitty: @s to the K and @d from dummy is probably best|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: that gains against @HAx and @HAxx with east, and loses only to @HAJx|pg||
nt|princi: do someone know what is 4 @D?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|djneill:  here, count is most important (how many spades will cash), so South will play a low @s|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|nt|chmitty: 5 only losers but I believe declarer will run short of trumps too soon|pg||

nt|chmitty: here declarer in trouble already|pg||
pc|c5|nt|barbyh: but not enough entries for the second club finesse|pg||
nt|aldo 01:  7 requires diamond finesse ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: It could be a q-bid denying a @s control or a 2nd @c control.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: of course it would have been harder after a club lead then three rounds of spades, with west threatening to overruff dummy :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I do not disagree with Berndt ... he cannot lead @D, @S would finess pd and trump gives away tempo ... but I would lead @CQ |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|barbyh: perhaps west might have bid 2nt to slow the auction down|pg||
nt|grebrof: thank you "private"|pg||
nt|chmitty: has to decide whether North has Q@s or K@d :)|pg||
nt|princi: I think it's about the distribution,not about control in diamond,as someone wrote me in private|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Contract is cold with hearts 3-2, just give a diamond|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: i guess east was going for singleton spade with partner but that was a bit of a long shot i think|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|danilo1: if 11s dble promissed @S .. someting is wrong with EW system ... why should notEast be able to Dble for penalty - and if so agreed, why than West does not Dble instead of 3@D ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: (already promissed 6-cards) bidding 2@D free|pg||
nt|wstuart: I'm not sure how to answer you, Espen.  Think of some auctions where you DBL and then cuebid - it's pretty obvious.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can eventually get to dummy with a diamond ruff and play a heart to the jack, i suppose|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|djneill:  ok so West should probably cash the @dA here because North has at most 1 diamond, it might be the King, but West may think South has all the diamonds, in which case, not cashing the dA is better so as to have the end position better|pg||
nt|djneill:  but for sure, West cannot pick up all the diamonds, North will not have a doubleton on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe the defence will run out of things to lead before that happens|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: one down will be a good save against  3@h|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chmitty: well .. playing 7 you may a/ set the @d with a ruff and next choose the right black suit finesse or b/ finesse @d which may lead to 13 tricks more easily in some cases|pg||

nt|queequeg: Welcome to Traian Chira @H|pg||
nt|bebechira: i will do my best to entertain you...ciao francesca|pg||
nt|grebrof: asking for a stopper is the most overrated bid in my opinion - you bid your suit and if your P has a stopper in opps suit I assume he/she will bid 3nt -  not showing your suit can ...|pg||

nt|wstuart: This will test the Michael's agreements for NS|pg||
nt|wstuart: Does this hand fall with the parameters of a Mich cuebid?|pg||
nt|wstuart: Some play a continuous range (5-0) HCP for their Mich, but some play a "split range" Mich.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: depends on agreement - it tells so much about your hand, that I use it as weak or strong - intermediate hands, I just overcann|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  I agree|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2c obv forcing|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm, i guess 2nt shows a maximum with no major|pg||
nt|black man: probably maggio francisci play ghestem so 2@s is a 2 suites bid: @c @h|pg||
nt|wstuart: regardless of which suits it shows, it is a valid thing for partnerships to discuss what teh potential ranges are for tshi bid.|pg||
nt|grebrof: there we agree completely Wayne :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Bridge is largely about putting partner on a range and a distr and refing the partnership's opinion of how many tricks that will produce.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: another good decision by Lavazza - could dbl giving the minors, but vulnerable isn't a good choice|pg||
nt|athene: not exactly what east wanted to hear|pg||
nt|chmitty: East hoped to play in a 44 major fit|pg||
nt|ritong: neat|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chmitty: for communication reasons you may win with @h ace and play a small @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm surprised that, if the partnership allows to make a Stayman with this hand, you can rebid to 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is well played with @s 3-2 (3 N), and @d K in S, still has to yield a trick if the @d Hs are split|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice when you have the right tool for your hand.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: In 2/1 this hand might have been more fun.  2@c by n, 2@s by s, p p ? (double or let them play?)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|danilo1: looks like missunderstanding ... guess Joanna will now simply bid 3NT|pg||
nt|chmitty: a success for the strong @c here if West leads his top @c unknown in the bidding|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|djneill:  not sure what the 2@d is, maybe it is a 3 card heart raise|pg||
nt|danilo1: anything alerted here (North hand is not reverse) ,,, so 2@D bid looks like style in Polish Club ... or eventually Fiori Romano|pg||
nt|athene: or, if you do play this system, it's against the odds to bid stayman on that east hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: This convention is becoming quite popular in France : 3@h or 3@s show shortage and no 4 card major|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wstuart: Too many players get involved with doing a "square dance" and just bidding by rules.  They have no way to think about an unfamiliar situation,|pg||

nt|chmitty: 6@h down board 2 in open room !! declarer played @h ace first ... major swing to Fornaciari|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if east decides to lead passively, say a diamond, i suppose you might just cash the @HAK intending to try to set up spades for a club pitch|pg||

pc|c5|pg||

nt|danilo1: believe Berndt wil lead @D or @S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barbyh: its 2 am here not quite awake|pg||
nt|chmitty: on a @s lead, you must decide to play on @h rather than @c I believe|pg||
nt|chmitty: difficult lead for declarer|pg||
nt|danilo1: wit no clue .. difficult to believe Joanna wil not try double @C finess ... still - lot of thinking now expected - since allso communication problems|pg||
nt|chmitty: well ... you can take in hand and play Ace @h and @h|pg||
nt|chmitty: they will end up in 3NT now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|danilo1: but maybe, South treated her hand as three-suiter|pg||
nt|chmitty: ok with @h 33 or K10 / Q10 doubleton|pg||
nt|chmitty: for players playing a 15-17 NT if they open 1NT the North's hand, they stay there|pg||
nt|chmitty: the North's hand is actually too strong for a 15-17 NT opening|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: say @DQ, @HAK, then if both defenders follow but no @HQ appeared, you would go @SA, spade ruff, @DA, spade ruff, but you need something very good to happen in spades|pg||
nt|chmitty: In French we would say "ils ont été pris avec les doigts dans le pot de confiture"|pg||
nt|ritong: or east, having felt pain with 2NT previous hand, did not want to inflict the same to her pard  very noble|pg||
nt|athene: a slightly odd hand here in that the defence do best to attack declarer's five-card suit, rather than their own :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: "caught with the fingers in the marmelade pot"|pg||
nt|athene: of course if declarer guesses the @SQ she is home anyway|pg||
nt|athene: but if NS don't play clubs fairly soon, she might survive a misguess there|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep but that's against the odds|pg||
nt|wstuart: West deserves to be killed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|santyclz: @h lead is the 9th trick. 1 1 2 5|pg||
nt|chmitty: you can play on @c|pg||
nt|danilo1: as all top players, Joanna in usually thinking lot on the lead .. later goes fast|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2/1 in @C - fine.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even that doesn't doom the slam if the hand with 4@hs also has 4@ds.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: And, as expected...|pg||

mb|2N|nt|grebrof: and I never opened @s at E|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: ok so east prefers to just show a good raise right away rather than doubling|pg||

nt|ritong: he has a good hand, but will have to give up|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  brd 17 that is|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to have a look, if you have the methods|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@C is Bue Club Fiori Napoletano) stile .. 1@C 17+ and 1@S = 3 controls (3K or A+K)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: in Poland very popular was conventional 1NT in defence bidding, which show 5m+4M|pg||
nt|chmitty: North has a difficult bid in a natural standard system|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@C is another in the category of "worst bid in hitory".|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  1@c roman, 1N positive but NF|pg||
nt|danilo1: at least 1@C looks like Fiori Romano |pg||
nt|ritong: the idea is to find @ss, and at max level|pg||
nt|chmitty: Everytime a "normal" hand, compatible with the bidding, makes a grand slam, you have to consider the small one |pg||
nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|chmitty: AKxx xxxx Kx Axx for instance|pg||
mb|3H|nt|djneill:  24 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: N-S utilizzano il fiori romano corto lungo|pg||
nt|danilo1: * or polish @C|pg||
nt|djneill:  6 sure tricks, 1@s, 2@h, 2@c, 1@d|pg||
nt|athene: a good example here of how a 4-4 fit can produce more tricks than a 5-4 or even 6-4 fit|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s looks healthy at that point|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  @c is likely to come in if 3-3 or @c honor sing/doub|pg||
nt|chmitty: One solution is to adopt a double relay sequence (2@c limited and 2@d game force) in theses situations|pg||
nt|chmitty: these*|pg||
nt|chmitty: everytime the 2@c bid is "free" (not only after a 1NT rebid from opener) you can use it|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@h isn't automatic, but it gives pd a chance to raise on a borderline hand with 3 card @h supt.|pg||
nt|chmitty: must show @h as well, I would say from West's action !!|pg||
nt|chmitty: a matter for discussion in the partnership : if you can x 4@s with the North's hand, then South has to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: there it sould go : North 2@c, South 2@d (forced) North 2@h : around 10 Hcp with 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: A quite good 7@s : you make 13 tricks in the 44 fit|pg||
nt|chmitty: to be discussed in a partnership : in this situation, the pass from South weak, or rather encouraging|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chmitty: very remote possiblites|pg||
nt|chmitty: double finesse K10 @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: plus some endplay in @c|pg||
nt|wstuart: South has to keep the bidding open since N might actually have something (which he doesn't) and @H might be the right strain.|pg||
nt|chmitty: as compared to a free 3@h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chmitty: think about it : of course it has a few inconvenients, but so many advantages :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: When @s are 32|pg||
nt|athene: yes, pretty much needs 3-2 spades or stiff jack|pg||
nt|athene: if you cash the @SAK and east shows out, you can pick them up, but it's no use|pg||
nt|chmitty: more classicaly, North can pass or bid 4NT |pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hugony recovering : 7@h bid and made board 3 !!|pg||
nt|ritong: ole|pg||
pc|cA|nt|djneill:  since West led 4th best @s, probably West has no other 4crd suit so no point to finessing round 1 I think|pg||
nt|athene: because you can't get a ruff in either hand for the thirteenth trick|pg||
nt|athene: of course it's a good job north is playing 7@S :) otherwise lightner double would be quite effective|pg||
nt|chmitty: Very tough bidding exercice with  natural methods : when you have discovered a @h fit, you hardly can investigate an alternative one in @s|pg||
nt|ritong: clearly so, yes|pg||
nt|chmitty: ans no losing @h of course|pg||
nt|grebrof: 4nt is often +5-5 thou|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: well, it's not certain by any means they will find even the small slam in the other room|pg||

nt|queequeg: --------------------------------------------|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't think you want to bid 7@S even if you know all the cards|pg||
nt|danilo1: is thiU rite .. looks like skows @H as well |pg||
nt|wstuart: So, south is off the hook, by making the only logical bid which proposes the right strain and caters to game HCP in the north hand.|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, no doubt who has the ace at least here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|santyclz: It's certainly becoming popular.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: i mean, even if you know all the NS cards|pg||
nt|chmitty: They stopped in 4@h next door|pg||
nt|ritong: that s right bill|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2 rounds of trumps, ruffed 2 diamonds, and finished with the @s finesse|pg||
nt|chmitty: impeccabile|pg||
nt|santyclz: What with the @d and @ss onside and no @d lead a @h guess is for the overtrick.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: not enough dummy entries to strip the clubs and get rid of diamonds and then throw him in with a trump|pg||
nt|danilo1: whatever mening of 1@H ... think 6@H is silly bid ... if rite contract ... it could be found slowly as well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|danilo1: leave @S once, take second  ... and finess @C8 is inviting|pg||
nt|chmitty: thus you can make a difference between the actual hand and for instance xx D10xxxx Kxx Jx|pg||

pc|hA|nt|athene: lauria knows his partner has the @CQ as declarer would have run the lead round to his hand if he had that|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: not sure why east didn't bid 1nt over 1@H|pg||
nt|djneill:  North should double this one|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: now lauria will double i guess rather than bidding 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: better to get the four spades into it rather than just the sixth heart|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure .. interesting is 2@D range ... may stop in 2NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: 2NT was a fine bid imho, despite the lack of @h stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: when opponents bid one suit, you focus on that suit as stopped or not for NTs  most of the time, you are not able to check the rest|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|djneill:  ok if 2@d is multi, perhaps North cannot double 2@s since that would be takeout|pg||
nt|santyclz: Assuming the overall hand's entries permit.  If you need to conserve dummy entries, you don't give up too much playing ak.|pg||
nt|athene: most would raise spades with that south hand i think|pg||
nt|santyclz: Getting to game on 4 (the 5@d hand) went a long way to negating the 7@h score.|pg||

nt|chmitty: that is, to me, an impossible bid : pass 1@h and then double 3 ... |pg||
nt|chmitty: you may pass 1@h if you have a penalty double in @h, and then double at the 3 level of course|pg||

mb|p|nt|chmitty: and finally decides for 1@d|pg||
nt|chmitty: not forcing ? not common nowdays|pg||
nt|chmitty: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c took care of the first king, and 2@d about the other|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that lauria's methods oblige him to pass that hand over the double |pg||

nt|djneill:  East has so many losers, hard to imagine 5@c|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@H surely discourage 5@C bid - East must pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: Shades of the 1950s.|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose if hearts come back to him at a reasonable level he will double|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep|pg||

nt|chmitty: as long as you can consider that a 20 count hand can be bad :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d    by Eats after passing is poerfect  no major and @c fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|djneill:  brd 22 another of the 1NT in one room 3NT in other|pg||
nt|grebrof: lets face it....|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: yes, your only long suit is 4 cards in openers's suit and not much strength|pg||
nt|athene: that reduces the playing strength quite considerably|pg||
nt|athene: i would think 1nt here is about 18-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: good (expected) lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: plenty of room to invite if need be|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: safe contract : there are enough entries to establish and cash the @s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bebechira: that may be...i am happy now that we found a reason for 3c|pg||

nt|ritong: where EW should land in 3NT one way or the other|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  only 3 game bids in 9 boards, hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 7@D is more or less on the club finesse|pg||

nt|toniemme: afyer the agction in other room this lineof play is possible because south overcall with doble and north show weak hand..|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  3@s good @h raise|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: looking on this now he should pass|pg||
nt|bebechira: seams reasonable to open with how many aces you have|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: no aces no opening bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: meanwhile calandra piling up the imps|pg||
nt|chmitty: can NS have a chance to lead a @d against 3NT ?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: 3nt not much fun here on a heart lead, but you might be forced to take the double club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: it's OK to double 2@D just to show cards, but you need to know what your next double means|pg||
nt|athene: opps are sure to bid something in a major|pg||
nt|athene: so when you double THAT, is it penalty or takeout? and is pass forcing?|pg||
nt|danilo1: no entries for North so no problem in probable 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: contract  will be 5@h|pg||
nt|black man: if I know maggio he bid 5@h surely|pg||
nt|black man: undo?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|danilo1: Canape ... even if I have it in system, not sure I would open 1@H here :)|pg||
nt|athene: west can set diamonds and ask for keycards then the @CK, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: and stop when it's missing|pg||
nt|chmitty: yes ... I doubt Bocchi will produce the @sJ lead :)|pg||
nt|aldo 01:  and W|pg||
nt|chmitty: I can't see how|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ritong: apparently west has a doubt about 3@d being forcing  tha's quite amazing|pg||
nt|athene: well, if you don't want to bid 3@D, how about 4@D?|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, west can bid 4nt now, if that is blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S might be a reasonable spot, but hard to get there|pg||
nt|djneill:  so South's Pass may have been forcing since North showed a strong game hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  if so North is encouraged to bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: over 4@S, I would surely bid 5@H here (would not be in same situation - as said before)|pg||

mb|2C|nt|djneill:  hmm, we saw something like this earlier, 1@c...2@d on a roughly balanced weak NT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: probably transfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: at least 500 if south passes this|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence time it right they can get 800 because south gets a spade ruff and then north leads the fourth spade to promote the @DJxx remaining|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4 card majors it seems... i will not say acol|pg||
nt|aldo 01:  This 4S is complicated in heart handling|pg||
nt|chmitty: @s were bid by North !|pg||
nt|chmitty: difficult to reach game now in EW|pg||
nt|chmitty: in that suit|pg||
nt|aldo 01:  letÂ´s see|pg||
nt|santyclz: It looks as if e may be claiming the suit...|pg||
mb|d|nt|danilo1: no Dble by East is surprising ... must be conventional|pg||
nt|toniemme: 3@D = no big support in @D..|pg||
nt|chmitty: yes|pg||
nt|chmitty: 4NT is a slam try |pg||
nt|chmitty: Soyth can accept with a maximum or decline with a minimum|pg||
nt|chmitty: the rule is : when no clear fit has been agreed, 4NT is not a Blackwood|pg||
nt|chmitty: note that the proper pay of the @s suit is Ace first and then small to the ... queen|pg||
nt|santyclz: No.|pg||
nt|ritong: different countries, different agreements  here, a majority of players in europe would play 1@d pass 1@s 2@s as natural i think|pg||
nt|chmitty: many pairs would play a 2@s bid by East (directly over 1@s by North) as natural bid|pg||
nt|chmitty: lol:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: So would many here thought I can't estimate a %.|pg||
nt|ritong: always pleasant when buddies agree:|pg||

nt|santyclz: The match is tightening.|pg||
nt|ritong: lauria has to decipher, i think|pg||
nt|ritong: not that easy|pg||
nt|chmitty: Ask Lauria to write down his partner's hand, according to the bidding ... you might be surprised !|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south bids 3nt that is likely to end the auction though|pg||
nt|chmitty: of course here, you see the Jack|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bebechira: and it looks like they missed game|pg||
nt|chmitty: Note that most players would rebid 1NT with North's hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: This rebid does not promise a @s stopper|pg||
nt|chmitty: in theory, the x shows shortage in @c|pg||
nt|ritong: which would explain initial pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: What do you bid with xxx Kxx Qxx AKJx ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 4-4 @d break makes 3nt a winning, if unlovely contract.|pg||
nt|ritong: best would probably be to shut the shop with 4@s|pg||
nt|chmitty: Difficult to bet where they will land|pg||
mb|4S|nt|djneill:  not convincing but they avoided the spade spade ruff, @d, ruff|pg||
nt|djneill:  in @h|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure about agreements - thk North should be stronger for 1NT bid|pg||
nt|djneill:  this is perfect for 3NT, despite two 4-4 major fits|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this contract should be 2 down|pg||
nt|chmitty: but if not, you add a small chance : Jx by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: may be old Albarran Canape?|pg||
nt|chmitty: next door also in 6NT|pg||
nt|chmitty: same lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: so nothing to the play and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  lucky :-)|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so the @d8 must be 3rd best, so North can reason that ducking is probably correct - very likely East has the Ten|pg||
nt|danilo1: since ew 4@H is -2 on the lead (whoever leads) ... and 1@S is not obvious overcall, this may be swing board|pg||
nt|djneill:  that seems right|pg||
nt|chmitty: partner has to verify that if he is willing to play in a NT game|pg||

nt|aldo 01:  so heart suit is a key|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chmitty: South thinking ... but why ??|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: east's only chance is to win the ace and return the ten :) hope south ducks, playing the lead for @DKxx :) not too likely|pg||
nt|athene: a bit harsh when you have to lead from an unsupported K, Q, J or 10 - and from the 10 costs :)|pg||

pc|sT|nt|lebridgeur: 3 down now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: The 2@c bid is more attractive if 1@c didn't show @cs or showed 2+.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bebechira: if 3s is invitational with 4 trumps what do you do with South hand|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if lauria showed 4, rather than 5 hearts|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chmitty: is a "safety play" to run the @h 6 before finessing the King ?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chmitty: it's amusing : 10 tables in la seria "excellence" ... 8 played in 3NT and only 2 in 6 NT : both in this match|pg||
nt|chmitty: down now :( no more communications|pg||
nt|aldo 01:  ty Henri|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: cash the @DK and then hope west has the @HA and @SK; maybe he can get both those if dummy can be endplayed|pg||
nt|chmitty: just in case of the actual layout ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: if so, opps might attack hearts and set up his fifth heart for the ninth trick|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|toniemme: normally..now 3 off...strange choice to play for KQ doubleton in south hand knowing @D break 6-2..|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c2|pc|d2|nt|athene: according to the lauria-versace CC, 2@D denied 5M, 3@C puppet, 3@D showed 4-card major|pg||
nt|athene: if he just played hearts it would make the position obvious to the defence so he ducks a diamond hoping to lure them into his long suit :)|pg||
nt|athene: but they did not fall for it|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|danilo1: well, @H QJ sec are OK .. still, I do not understand @H play before @S (double stop in all suits)|pg||
nt|danilo1: mean on 1NT ... extremelly pasive action by Doris to allow cheap 2@S contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: South is known to have a 0445 distribution I believe, from the bidding|pg||

nt|chmitty: you may have a laydown 5@d contract, despite the 1NT bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: difficult bid anyhow|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chmitty: This is agood hand for the following convention : 1@c(or @d) 2@h : 5@s + 4(5) @h and a weak hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: x is very dangerous|pg||
nt|ritong: one thing is for sure, with @d Axx her pard has not a penalty pass for @ds|pg||
