mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|mamos: well???? whhats all this?|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: not after this start, though I suppose they have another chance|pg||
nt|dburn: all this is East opening a fairly strong no trump|pg||
nt|idc: I quite like West's hand evaluation - at MP for example I would pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: but at teams I'm surprised by pass|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: maybe he miscounted his points - clever of North to give him another chance|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT 15-17?|pg||
