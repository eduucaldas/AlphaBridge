nt|bessi2: I didn't want to be too mean myself.. these guys are friends of mine :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: I dont think the XX is right, you live in the spade hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I suppose they fear a sacrifice at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nicksan: i know them too, but I think West would agree it wasn't the best bidding decision of his life.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jtr: I think only South needs to:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  two finesses plus a trump split?|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think S will be up to cashing his 3 winners - and waiting for his trump trick|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|sybarra: and I really dont want S getting a suit going at the 2 level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would never play a system that forces me to open 1@s on that East hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: he can cash out for 1 down, if he tries an early di finesse he will regret it|pg||
nt|nicksan: i can only see 7 tricks..|pg||
nt|jbgood: he can force S to lead from the @d king in the end |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|jbgood: was 2@d natural with @ds and another higher?|pg||
nt|toobad: yes.......... might let them find easy H fit|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|bessi2: why didn't he run 5 club tricks first.. no risk to that|pg||
nt|jbgood: cannot have been - 5 more IMPS for Gillis|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps better than that|pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|dburn: here, though, South seems not to want to suggest playing in hearts either|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe redouble is some convention|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: re-double force 2@C?|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but that seems an odd thing for East to be doing|pg||
nt|the saint: THere may be a system mix up. Jones may have XXed to play, and Paul thinks it is to run|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if redouble were for blood South would never pass, so I guess that must be what is happening|pg||
nt|the saint: If it was to play then Connolly certainly should have bid 2H|pg||
nt|vugraphzwp: xx alerted after S had bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Their card does say 1N is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|the saint: It is, but Paul will upgrade on a whim|pg||
nt|dburn: it's not that 3@h will make, of course - it won't, and it may well go down several|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So will 2@S but it's undoubled|pg||
nt|dburn: but 2@s is not exactly a bed of roses either - still, at least no one doubled|pg||
nt|othered1: But if it is 15-17, redouble looks to have been for business.  Something about my understanding of this must be awry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: I suspect that East-West's understanding of this was awry|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: or non-existent|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s3|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|othered1: East seems to have no reason to run to @C and if XX were business, then pass over 2@S surely was forcing|pg||

nt|othered1: Fiona Abbott and the Scottish Bridge Union, for bringing this event to BBO Vugraph.  Finally, thanks to my fellow commentators, David Burn, David Edwin, Alan Shillitoe and Roland ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Wald for offering their perspectives on this match.|pg||
nt|othered1: Thats Sandra Claridge, rather|pg||
nt|dburn: Northern Ireland did reach game on 22 - not a hopeless contract, but not a great one either, so England picked up 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|dburn: but here is a chance for Northern Ireland at the death|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last match today in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 minutes to the hour|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: although to make a grand slam, you would need to do something pretty remarkable|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4NT now seems about right|pg||
nt|dburn: and to bid one after this start is close to impossible - even getting to six might be problematic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless they have a method to spot a minor fit|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I might rather cue-bid, looking for a fit, then 4N over 3H, over which north might show a minor suit.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|othered1: That's if you have defined a cue-bid on this auction|pg||

pc|d9|nt|ady: small win for England    but they did only have 1 poor result   and that was the against odd  6@H  by N.Ireland|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: In many of my partnerships we have defined a cue-bid for situations where opponents have opened an ambiguous action.  Here it would be 3@C, simply by definition|pg||
pc|s7|mc|12|nt|ady: odds against 6@H|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  good slam 31 HCP good controls and a good trump suit should make it possible to bid|pg||

nt|jtr: Thanks|pg||
mb|2D|nt|galadriel: Evening David :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: (not saying it is necessarily great spot) |pg||
mb|2S|nt|jtr: Not so eay now|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Anne|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT from South will catch a big raise|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mamos: though wont make much difference here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @H person, since hand not strong enough for true reverse|pg||
nt|mamos: If you open 1@d it sometimes gets hard to show Hearts|pg||
nt|toobad: Jacoby is a good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Tricky for North to bid 2NT over the Multi with no spade stopper|pg||
nt|jtr: East might have bid more but were fearful of partner having a strong option|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: South a little light for 2NT perhaps...|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: Hauge seem to have recovered after 2 losses and make a challenge if Gillis lose by let us say 11-19.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hard to see this ending up in anything other than 4 @H, making, or possibly 3 NT|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@c shows shortage|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C shortness I assume |pg||
nt|mamos: they may bid this now|pg||
nt|toobad: 6 now or Blackwood?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what now? |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: No nonsense!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  nice to have one of my predictions come true :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|toobad: no hurry, quite rightly|pg||
nt|sybarra: the delicate approach |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  standard play in diamonds - top from North first|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: i think someone will just bid it soon though|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: serious 3 nt|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bessi2: i wonder what 3@h means|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the cue bids go on |pg||
pc|d7|nt|nicksan: I wonder if a trump lead from South could break it? This, however, won't do it.|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 2 @c was @ds, perhaps W just showed his distribution?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bessi2: i think a trump beats it Nick|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the last board of this weekend, and some thanks are due.  Thank you operator operator Hrafnhildur, for your tireless efforts during these days. Well done indeed! And thanks ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: to sponsor Iceland Express and Bridgesamband Íslands (Ólöf),  for making it possible for us to watch the this exciting bridge live.  And of course thanks to BBO and Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|nicksan: yes, think so. E/W getting rewarded here for not mentioning the Clubs in the bidding|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|sybarra: its the shape of W hand that has not been made clear to E|pg||

nt|jbgood: Last, but not least, a big thank you to the audience, your inputs are always appreciated.|pg||
nt|toobad: oops|pg||
nt|mamos: two key cards missing|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam needs the k of @H on side or dropping |pg||
nt|toobad: clearly v steady players. a reasonable auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Keri (N) thinking she has 2 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|toobad: i've just been told that W played for Scotland in the Europeans last year|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  could h!9 be suit preference to show the @sJ?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
