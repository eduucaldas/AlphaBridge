pc|c2|nt|sybarra: and here also|pg||
nt|toobad: no trial bids here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: they start (as usual) with brds 9 and 10 of this segment to get comparisons after those|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: from you yes, but an inexperienced junior|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: with only 2 @H bid not sure why a trial should even be considered|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|nicksan: Last making spot right now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|nicksan: Although maybe a trump lead and some very careful defending...|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - nice lead may take it down|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: and 2 @H constructive, ...even so |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: pard unlikely to have enough except for perfect hand (which pard never has)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs a good view - but alas that wasn't it |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as long as East plays a diamond, of course  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: which he should do, as West cannot have @sAK|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the open room, declarer ran @CJ and East returned a third @H for +1|pg||
nt|sybarra: tempting to put the ht on the table I think |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't think I can agree with that, Shirley - East can see that @sQ is an entry for the clubs |pg||
nt|toobad: Kd cant cost|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if partner has @DQ and @sA a diamond switch is needed immediately|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
