mb|1C!|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|kit: another light overcall -- they are consistent|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and S shouldn´t double on @cAK|pg||
mb|1N|an|!c|nt|lestergold: you should not assumer that partner is doubling for maybe 1 off holding a couple,ofm bullets it must be lead directing|pg||
nt|kit: and a club lead is the expected lead with no double, given the splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lestergold: altho combihned 24 points n/s its a horrible misfit no where near a 3n contract|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no|pg||
nt|warrens:  just need to avoid 6@d.  6@h makes too|pg||
nt|lestergold: but only cos Gold has to follow to 3 rouhnds of hearts|pg||

nt|lestergold: Orsmond in  thinking that he didny open 2@c to play a slam in his void!|pg||
