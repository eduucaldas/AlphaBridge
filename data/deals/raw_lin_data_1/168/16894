nt|ralfwil: Gooe evening everyone!|pg||
nt|chick: NS may end up in a very reasonable 4@S, going down on the bad trump split and offside kings|pg||

mb|2D|nt|sybarra: and hello again to William our operator|pg||
mb|2N!|an|INV+ w support|nt|andyv:  hi Nigel|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Erik is at the other table =)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Hi Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: EW may find a heart contract here|pg||
nt|lestergold: prefer double with E to allow for @hs|pg||
mb|4H!|an|void|nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=3427  stilling efter 4 runder|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt was weak with minor |pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry for Danish, I am sure you can figure it out|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thinki that is standing after 4 rounds|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: and good evening to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's a very aggressive double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is there a prize?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wd :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: club lead needed to beat 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  so here we are, now we just have to make it....|pg||
nt|chick: 2N is certainly a forcing raise and 4@S says nothing extra|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, was trying to locate William and typed you in by accident:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Peter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Peter!|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy hand to declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: too bad the hands ae so weak in n/s |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: still time to switch |pg||
nt|lml: South didnt want to lead from anything into the strong hand|pg||
nt|lml: which is good and bad when you are trying to set 1NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or maybe not..|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht void will not escite south!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  is it aggressive or just highly optomistic?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Peking need to claw back into this match |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Mike, would you double 1 club with the west hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably a push now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure Mike, surprised East didn't double 1 spade|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jillan:  East doesn't really have a good lead.|pg||
nt|chick: that lead will help a lot, giving a pitch for a red loser|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can make with correct play. May not play a high @s from the hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chick: it's true, any lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and after A@h what then?|pg||
nt|pelu: DD a @d|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe not A@h niow|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs an entry to @d if he finds that play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi all, what system are EW playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Some kind of swedish @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: weak bal or strong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, N can get spade ruff|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think so|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnc: Welcome back to the broadcasting of the 12th Filbyter Cup, Round of 16. We are in the city of Linkoping (with approximately 150.000 inhabitants) at the east coast of Sweden, some ...|pg||
nt|rnc: 200 kilometres south of Stockholm. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@s for me |pg||
nt|lestergold: prefer to give my partner 3 places to play rather than one!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnc: Some words about the format of this tournament might be needed. Filbyter Cup is a handicap-based tournament. Every player in Sweden has a nation wide handicap, however based on all ...|pg||
nt|rnc: the pairs tournaments the player has played...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: with phantom opening bids, looks more like a forcing pass system|pg||
nt|xenya: no, 1@C can be 15+|pg||
nt|andyv:  our vugraph operator is William|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok spade now from S |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...I'm sure I would..|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wrong to duck!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...making 12 is going some tho'|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|nigel_k:  Both probably, I was going for the most complimentary description I could think of|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnc: ...A team's hcp is calculated as the average of the players involved in the specific segment. The hcp-average for the two teams is compared and the difference then divided by 10, ...|pg||
nt|rnc: which gives us the number of IMP's per board the 'less skilled' team get as a bonus. As it is a KO-match, even a fraction of an IMP might be important at the end of the match...|pg||
nt|lestergold: a small @d to the T if won by south gets declare3r no where|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Trying|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi Mike :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: both pairs playing strong @c systems|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: heigh ho|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: that @D8 may actually prove to be an important card|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnc: All hcp-IMP's are included in the above shown standings.|pg||
nt|xenya: so 1@C is either a mini NT or a relatively strong hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, I am surprised to discover Peking is a district of Sweden|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Germ Kemper, his 2nd segment overall|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s will look at the hand and .....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mutter silently|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a wonderful explanation |pg||
nt|golfergolf: 1up|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: double is more flexible, I must agree|pg||
nt|sommer: restricted choice|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: declarfer is going for the endplay|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 180|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nigel_k:  380 now I think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...so reckon this is a good score for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: helped by the 2@d overcall|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here's a good example of the pitfalls of these two-way methods - was it 100% clear to West that East had the "mini"?|pg||
nt|sommer: a lot, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  Maybe not|pg||
nt|sybarra: the teams choose their names |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any bid that can be described as "flexible" always scores maximum marks in bidding competitions|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: we thought it was a team from China who got lost at the airport|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: playing in effect to limit his loss to 1 off if possible|pg||
nt|golfergolf: strong club, thank you |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I can't find a town called Zang inm y map of Sweden|pg||
nt|lml: this defence will work out fine to hold it to 2|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: hn north was better off playing a heart|pg||
nt|chick: that play won't work out well if E guesses to duck|pg||
nt|rnc: Convention card for E/W available at: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc11/fc_main_en.htm - then look under Convention Cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n not an easy contract to defend of course|pg||
nt|chick: S will be endplayed to give declarer one of the red jacks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And it points the way to how to play against them - get in early and as high as possible, as South did here|pg||
nt|andyv:  you were right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  pretty expensive duck by W|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: and Peking is in the North as it the club these players are from in Sweden|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear a ping pong of 'wrong' views i wont say errors!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|s7|nt|lml: it isn't that easy to pitch perfectly to hold it to 1 after the passive lead|pg||
nt|lml: well done|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will make now . the big mistake was to duck @sJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: decl can discard @DJ he will still get @Hj|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West discarded a diamond allowing declarer to set up an eight trick, then declarer decided not to, but the defence declined to take their six tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: that looks pretty flat|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually William can say it better but that is the gist of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: well, they are from the city "Norrköping" Norr = norht, did not say that Norrköping is in the north of sweden :)|pg||

mb|r|nt|ralfwil: and just made, so be careful|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4D|mb|d|nt|chick: E can't expect they will play in diamonds, so why not show his heart support?|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||

nt|andyv:  3N about the max for NS on this hand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Are we sure it was nine tricks, I thought East could claim the rest at the end|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: you mean flexible in an ironic sort of way, then|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: but we suspect that, somehow, it is |pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwe: 1NT is 0-6 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|golfergolf: OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm they do not seem to like take out doubles here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: another 1NT - just as well David Bird is not here|pg||
nt|lml: this one wont be quite so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and this one not likely to be successful|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not really - the Bridge World panel use the word quite a lot though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: it will need some help from the defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: well who0 wouold have expected such an exciting contract to be reached here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wilkinsona: club required, it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think that will be forthcoming|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: your computer...?|pg||
nt|sommer: looks like 2 down on higher steaks|pg||
nt|lestergold: which is rather good for n/s as they cant make much their way|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, tho the 2 Diamonds in CR a strange choice..|pg||
nt|sommer: no, misfit is doublesided almost always:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..2@S would work from N, I guess|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: trump?!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If a trump, it should probably be the king ... but I don't think he will|pg||
nt|sybarra: and club is not easy from E is it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not when partner bid spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club switch for the setting trick will become obvious in due course|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: this does not look to be too much of a challenge |pg||
nt|sybarra: esp with this lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: hoi Germ |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|lml: declarer is just missing too many aces|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  so board one was actually -380|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: if 1NT 0-6 then W only car5ds to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Hi shirley and Mike|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: and tough to have 2 suited bid when S bids one of your suits|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: The point of playing the king is that if declarer now ruffs clubs in dummy, one of them will be with the queen, promoting North's trumps back into play|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jillan:  no way this can make now. 3 spades and one H|pg||
nt|jillan:  IF the take them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: welcome|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well a diamond also ok, I suppose|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: declarer may wll be put to the @d guess on the second round of the suit too|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona: but south has gone wrong it seems|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sommer: only @C5?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nigel_k:  There aren't enough entries to set up and use the club suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  on this hand, with @ds, behaving, declarer has an easy route to 9 tricks and possibly 10 if he takes the @s hook|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But still nine tricks, or ten with the spade finesse|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: q of @D makes sense|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzwe: N/S CC|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence slightly too busy here I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but nothign was really  obvious|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzwe: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/cc/sh-ta.pdf|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: now  -3|pg||
nt|lml: from declarer's point of view the club finesse could work|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably playing udca|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: udca is standard in Sweden, as are 3rd/5th leads|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also against NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and declarer is feeling the pressure and has given up on further @d tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: well, -2 needed a very tight defence...|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lousy pips id rather than double even tho only three @s at least headed by K|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: guess he should have cashed his diamonds for heart pitches before playing another trump|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h9|nt|sybarra: N may get endplayed here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs the club hook  for 7|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra:  from a chinese friend:  peking,pe means north,and king means capital literally in chinese|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  Remember that declarer doesn't know the diamond layout so is trying to obtain as much information as possible before tackling the suit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: taking the trump hook..|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: Would the @SK switch have gained a trick I wonder?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always two club losers though|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: and the City "Norrköping" is what i have heard, sometimes called "Peking" even though its not in the north :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jillan:  yup|pg||
nt|chick: in fact, that was so obvious, I'd love to hear his reason for not doing it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: he didnt even try it.|pg||
nt|sommer: but only -100 now and a boring flat board|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wilkinsona: Mach have a pretty good lead, but I see a great Zang score on 23 OR so maybe a close match yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see this kind of bid go for big numbers in money games frequently|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|chick: N wisely saw danger here|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: It looks as if e-w are playing an artificial @c system to open that 1@d.|pg||

nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: The reason is that N lead a spade from hand out of turn|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but better is to look for Easts distribution. 5@h and perhaps/probably 4@d. @s can be 4-1|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have saved an imp |pg||
nt|mdgraham: very decent 6@s|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|pelu: again one of my normal rubber-hands in East :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: The 21 IMPs must be some kind of carryover from a previous session|pg||
nt|jillan:  sorry partner I am an idiot is what I would like to say and hear when I screw up|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as cards lie i thinkl 5@d rolls in|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: a bit strange since even if it fails he probably wont go 2 down|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 6@d is unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: on a club lead a bit dicey isnt it? |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @S that is |pg||
nt|sommer: +90 is big score for EW in CR|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bjacobs: It seems to me that the @SK switch would in fact have defeated the contract ... that's one to remember|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south need to ruff the third diamond and push throw another club, holds declarer to just spade ace in endgame|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a wild hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: brave 2@S - works well|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwe: Popular contract|pg||
nt|chick: nah, I don't want to hear that kind of thing ... bridge is a game of mistakes ... would be more interesting to hear his reasoning, even if wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly, but you would expect diamonds and spades to play for twelve tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: he was pretty sure that east would not have played club away from K|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: brave 2 spades by west should be raised|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is wrong with x by east as in closed|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jillan:  maybe they should just bid 4@S directly|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfergolf: There goes the Club k=lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that was 4@S by East, I bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: is this auction for real?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess East could not bid 3@c forcing after the reverse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good stop|pg||
nt|lml: yes but I still think it was worth a go|pg||
nt|lestergold: as well as the fact that with good spade suit and K@c he might have opened the bidding if he held any more high cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, Hmmmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is content|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 2@s shows @c in their sys|pg||

nt|chick: why waste time bidding, just set the contract at 4@S for whoever has the longest spades :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but  magnus explanation tells everything|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  this auction seems cumbersome|pg||
nt|lml: yes all of that is true but I hate it when it turns out that for some reason East didn't bid and did have the card|pg||
nt|sommer: 7 ..or maybe 8 tricks ..still 1 imp for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of worl to do here in 2@H|pg||
nt|sommer: there is a chance for 5 imps..especially with this lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: true, though I would have tried 2 clubs over the double from west for less success|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: cross ruff in the defence after a @c or @hA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: my defense works also|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am getting impression n/s at this table are quite conservative |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this wil make |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1 they played 5 @D X at the other table|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sommer: sure..7 seems like max|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  if not playing Lebensohl, E had a problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c is not a think of beauty when 6 is a laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the discard on the A@c is not going to do declarer that much good|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: whre did S find that 3NT bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  thing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: result seems to be 3D-1 insted of 4 spades|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the club return will!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jillan:  yup,simplifies the bidding, and would really show skill. NOT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: he might have gone more off also becaus he still didnt know the lie of the diamonds |pg||
nt|lml: unlikely but possible... East was even less likely to have the DA at that point and even then |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They needed to agree clubs and start cue bidding to find the @hK then West can bid 6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: eight now though |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: But declarer played weakly as well surely - he should have taken a heart ruff for his 8th trick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sommer: was back to 7:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: yes agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: he aslo saw west signal for a club Linda|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: So to be honest, all three of them will want to forget that hand|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sommer: ..bua again 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand the club return|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: Not that we are letting them ...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: true it might have been a lie but that was not likely here|pg||
nt|lml: I agree though great stop here.   Probably possible only when West is a passed hand|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzwe: 2NT was GF and 3NT showed balanced hand|pg||

nt|andyv:  yes, even up to the 4 level, I wasn't sure on what they had agreed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW must expect a well deserved loss there|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: back to -1, declarer had a chance but needed to read it just right|pg||
nt|sommer: it ended with the predicted 7:)..but shifted between 7 and 8 4-5 times|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has so many clubs they wont fit in the box|pg||

nt|lestergold: i tell a lie you cant touch 4@s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: or 3n for that matter palyed by west|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jillan:  4@S|pg||

nt|bjacobs: No one is finding the defence to beat this one|pg||

nt|lestergold: bidding it not so easy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a real tester, this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can touch 4@S|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, but he will never end there:)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwe: N bid 2NT as invitational but S thought it was GF|pg||
nt|mdgraham: choices for West|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South of Stockholm, on the Baltic coast - very confusing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HA, h ruff, 2 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  anyone ...|pg||
nt|lml: 6@H is more likely and 4 is certainly possible|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4S can go down I think|pg||
nt|sommer: yes it can|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u 4@s played by west is also off  on @h and continuation|pg||
mb|5S|nt|chick: maybe yet :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  but I think they will swtitch to @H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Clearly E/W are playing a system designed for alpha-males|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fourth best|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but 5@C is obvious|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: surprise E did not bid 3 @S |pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: would you bid 4@H now with N?|pg||
nt|jillan:  yes|pg||
nt|chick: me too|pg||

nt|pelu: tx|pg||
nt|lestergold: ic|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: not after this self splinter!|pg||
nt|lml: that is a nice bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, Mrs Guggenheim might be just the player to defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could transfer to spades and then bid diamonds, or the other way around |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there seem to be quite a few kopings in that vicinity|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Harmon Edgar|pg||
nt|harmon: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well done by south and now 7 might be in reach|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure 3@C=minimum is best. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Harmon|pg||
nt|harmon: was gonna be tuff in OR not understanding a word:)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybenot, but at least they seem together on it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: depends how far 2NT is forcing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, that's what counts|pg||
nt|lestergold: however god didnt deal me a solid 9 card suit to defend with!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: now will a jump here showm the void|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wilkinsona: well this seems to play well in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes they have bid this beautifully|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 5@S??|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: 4@H is easy to make, but 3N looks fine too ... opponents have no suit to set up|pg||
nt|harmon: low heart here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least not at the 4 level|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sommer: NS need points.. get 9 now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but defend he does..|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: at least this way shows five spades, which is probably more important |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can make 10 it seems on the "marked" guess in diamonds|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: cant see this 1n making|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence knows nothing about declarer's hand which makes it very difficult|pg||
nt|golfergolf: No problem now|pg||
nt|lml: perfect ... bravo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done indeed |pg||
nt|Walddk4: indeed, well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: a real example of how to bid this kind of hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jillan:  he is lucky in the @H distribution and also a bit in the @D and @S them being onside|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|harmon: he read my mind!!!|pg||
nt|harmon: must be illterate:)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I have to concede board 13 to you mike, as the (awful in my opinion) 1 spade overcall was repeated in the other room|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is a handicap event, and the NS team started with 21 IMP plus|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: 1 more for declarer unless defence slip up|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Mind you, if playing with the Unlucky Expert, he would win the diamond and play a club, expecting North to be void|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not quite sure how North knew about solid trumps and extra trumps|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should ruff second club in case south is void heart|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: Not 4@h for me. S has decided 3n1 after a 2@h bid from N. If interested , S should have bid 3@d for checking the majors. N can have 5-4, 5-5 or 6-4 inmajors|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's the ninth trick |pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: and Marked in clubs also|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: I'm surprised at the @D pitch ... E could still have the @D9 from W's point of view|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: pard (and opps)  probably a bit surprised when a 5/2/6/0 hits the table|pg||
nt|lml: I think the self splinter should show extra trump... it would for me|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: suspect that was a higher diamond played by west first round|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S can now squeezwe W for 11 tricks|pg||

nt|rnc: handicap, however based on all the pairs tournaments the player has played...|pg||
nt|rnc: ... A team's hcp is calculated as the average of the players involved in the specific segment. The hcp-average for the two teams is compared and the difference then divided by 10, ...|pg||
nt|rnc: which gives us the number of IMP's per board the 'less skilled' team get as a bonus. As it is a KO-match, even a fraction of an IMP might be important at the end of the match...|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: but thism one not as lucky|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rnc: The 21 IMP's 'bonus' for Vintage is for the whole match (of 24 boards).|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt looks like maximum on this board|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N probably for the minors|pg||
nt|andyv:  W trying to pull the trigger and bid 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: yes, but there was no alert|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 14 played other way up OR, down on the club lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfecto fit here and K@s on side but n/s have not really got a 4@s call|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Running scores at http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=3427|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 level still safe for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: unless a club lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what to lead....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @s9 or 8 would be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  5@h is safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: can be made with the safety play in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  yes you need either the @S or the @D to come home, and they both do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Curious to find a Chinese team playing in the Swedish District finals|pg||
nt|henryb:  why? declarer can pick up trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you there a re problesm ahead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this looks frisky|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: can west show his clubs without implyhin he has 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 1H was 4+, 3C shows longer clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is this Steen Moller sitting East?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: No, Christian Möller|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Christia|pg||
nt|golfergolf: n|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all this players are from a district league in two swedish cities, i dont think any of them we would know|pg||
nt|golfergolf: also 6@S on b4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and will|pg||
nt|mdgraham: somehow you feel this is the sort of hand that ought not to be allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: because @SQ first is correct play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, sorry - West has @s9, so it's ok|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is not a safety play, just ordinary techmiwue|pg||
nt|lestergold: if declarer draqws trumps he has a heart loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: a second heart loser i mean|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: I guess I have the wrong nationality as well ...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe East can double for a heart lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: good duck |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Peking duck|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Standard suit combination|pg||
nt|henryb:  technique|pg||
nt|lml: it is the kind of hand that you use to illustrate safety plays... an instructive hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well u can only pick up 4 trumps if they are in south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so easy when there isa 2 way option|pg||
nt|Walddk4: IT's not a safety play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played, it seems|pg||
nt|henryb:  strange play unless "Jack Denies"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can make it now because you can pick up diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jillan:  15 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: Yes, if any of @s or @d breaks - 13 tricks|pg||
nt|jillan:  now see if they can bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: W has now denied 5H when not bidding 3H|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a @h lead will sink this|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a matter of technique|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: safety in the sense of playing a spade to the Q first|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes thatb saves day|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: 4@D??|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i was expecting 3N after 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E fell in love with his hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  S will be happy with this result|pg||
nt|lestergold: technically notm a safety play i agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  safety plays (definition) involve conceding a possibly unnecessary trick yo avoid losing too many|pg||
nt|lestergold: however its become rather academic|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and therefore 7nt is better than 7@s|pg||
nt|rnc: It's with mixed feelings I watch (and perhaps comments) this match, since it's my teammates that are playing in the E/W team :), the same team that lost the nail biting finals ...|pg||
nt|rnc: (however under the name of San Sac) with a couple of IMP's after 96 boards the previous year.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 7nt from E with the @d suit|pg||
nt|rnc: For those interesting in the CC of E/W it's available at http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc11/fc_main_en.htm - check under Convention Cards|pg||
nt|chick: knowing all aces+@SK, E only needs to know about the @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E knows W has 5S, 4C and all aces and spade queen are counted for|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or 7@s as well and W can decide the final contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: not sure why west gave up|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: perhaps trying to stay away from NT with a void in pard's suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: weoh dear|pg||
pc|sK|nt|golfergolf: Spell their names in Chinese Characters|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: both teams in this optimistic game|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they just make up the names of teams|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: fell in love - but now close to a divorce :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least he gets the 150 honours|pg||
nt|chick: yikes|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think he was frightened of going off in 3N with 8 top tricks and bound to get another in one of the suits he over valued his hand thats why he went on|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E has to contemplate over his lousy bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: west bid his hand perfectly and if anything had better than he promised|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzwe: 7D was suggestion to play in that suit, so I think W should have bid 7NT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: agree magnus 5nt also shows @sQ as E already has denied her|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: thats correct =)|pg||
nt|lestergold: u are absolutely right Henry|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: probably the night before over cocktails  |pg||

nt|sybarra: same here Germ |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, just the spade hook, the lead and the diamond position, no probs..|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: east saved a trick not splitting his honours|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|lml: so we see the "technique" work out|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If the grand slam depends on @sQ (not with W), he can (at least as I play) ask for that card with 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E denied Q of S so 5NT showed the SQ as it's a grand slam try|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|lestergold: well u are not likely to win a match if u fail to bid ur small slams whileoppos are reaching their grands|pg||
nt|lml: declarer probably wishes the spades were 4-0 the other way|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is rather East who, looking at all primes, made no (to me) obvious forward going moves, is to blame|pg||

pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: Well, I suppose it might make, but probably it will get what it deserves|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he might make for lack of convenient dummy entry|pg||

nt|vugraphzwe: D was for penalties and I can't see why W didn't pass with two aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely west has shown his two suiter and east's douible for busienss why should west remove it with 2 bullets but very poor stuffing in his suits?|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: duck one club and then win ace and play third round|pg||
nt|henryb:  cold, but takes some good quessing|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has to ruff with Q and take a view|pg||
nt|henryb:  West has to play clubs before any trumps, then ruff with @hQ and run 10|pg||
nt|lml: true west has to guess that north has the @HJ and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: if the defence find the duck etc he wil llikely get that right|pg||
nt|henryb:  he might play one round of trumps first, and then he is down on best defense|pg||

nt|lestergold: even at equal its very dangerous witgh such an awful suit|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|wilkinsona: no question..|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a savage layout for e/w as they bid to an unmakeable game somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: the auction might suggest that things arent splitting|pg||
nt|lml: but it is hard to avoid game with 26HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is  good hand for Lebensohl ... North bids 2NT, then signs off in 3@H over 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the tenth trump is useful |pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the lead was fine, and the contract was cold regardless of lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vbman: needs a cl singleton from s hand with cards closed|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm east warned west|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: ending in something doubled|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will not be happy with how the suits split|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: the double of 3@s must suggest penalty surely|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: I hope no one thinks their partner has shown the @DA|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that heart lead this is off|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder what 1@h-2NT-4@C would be. If that is a splinter the South hand would be huge|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: ouch, exactly :(|pg||
nt|jillan:  I think both thinks the other one has...|pg||
nt|chick: This is of course the danger in cuebidding first OR second round controls|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: This is why they invented Blackwood|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vbman: there|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently they already knew club singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 4@c = void|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: good observation Magnus, N could have asked keycards after 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: S says he thinks N had a void in D when he didn't ask for aces|pg||
nt|vbman: but needs 13th trick|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Haven't seen 4NTx for a while :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: from the fryimng pan.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defended 5NTxx a few years back|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT probably makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyhone knowm what they would lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even on a heart lead it makes. The defence will be thrown in to break a minor|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: well declarer has a pretty good idea about how the cards lie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes....badly|pg||
nt|henryb:  If it is slam invitational with clubs I think North undervalued his hand. The @cQJ become BIG CARDS and outside that he is all prime with controls in all suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: he could have bid 3@d as 4-cards|pg||
nt|henryb:  really!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vbman: thats the 6th trump|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: cold, but not easy, there is perhaps 11 on the lead|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless error|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c7|pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that is not the best line....|pg||
nt|lml: if he worked out how the clubs lay which he might have he probably has a shot at 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's not a difficult line, Tony|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: no error|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2NT is four-card support, North could have "lied" about holding the @hQ |pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: still, it's a good bidding test to get to seven|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do we agree with that way of handling hearts|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: Not particularly, but we certainly don't agree with taking the diamond finesse prior to testing the clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That was a genuine blunder|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because if clubs are 3-3, he doesn't need the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont see that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might endplay west of course in trumps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: Henry is right of coarse, the bad part of his hand - QJ doubleton - has just become good|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: This hand may show up in my upcoming class on cuebidding :)|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  West can't really count 13 tricks as partner could have x Kx AKJxxx xxxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  playing specific kings|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even then you need a 4-3 spade break to make 12|pg||

nt|sybarra: that lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW made the difficult 5 clubs in OR will be disappointed to be -9 on the hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nigel_k:  It is the seventh diamond and third heart that make it good|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, that is why I think E needed to jump to 7 level|pg||

nt|sybarra: or are we replaying this hand?  |pg||
nt|henryb:  NO|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: If S follows through and leads a @H, this will be difficult to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: You have to play on D 3-3 for 1 down|pg||
nt|chick: N has 3 entries and S stops the remaining suit|pg||
nt|jillan:  avoid 4@S here, 3NT seems the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  especially not if this is the way they get to 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: horrible duplication and 3 of west's meagre milton's are as valuable as an icelandic bank|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: This might get NBS Lind onto the score card|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I don't have a problem upgrading East, but you know that suits are not breaking and partner has passed so it is quite easy for them to balance|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the 10s, esp. the major suit ones, the hand evaluates to a little better than 15.5 hcp|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So I think it pays for East to be a bit stronger than usual in this situation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be something systemic here - South removing 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, both minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|henryb:  For the record, both N-S pairs play this unusual use of 2@d which I have never seen before|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: at the other table i think they play "sunderlin" not the same as this one|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: bet he did, if South is there with 2@h|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: seem s odd that north is silent with 17 count and south is protecting with a couple of quacks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, light opening, even these days|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: I'll try to publisch some summary of the systems as soon as possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Povl Sommer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|harmon: down to 11|pg||
nt|harmon: or 12 |pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: at the other table 3@h bid showed singelton 3@s 9 cards minors|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if west does not open game is still likely to be bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: NS plays strong @C 14-16NT and neb 1@D|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, true..|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: EW plays natural, 15-17NT, 4cM, 2@C some strong hands or weak @H, 2@D some strong hands or weak w @S, 2M Acol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 'Frissan' is Swedish slang for 'The Hairdresser"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: Yes magnus, but E will probably play for splitted @c honours|pg||
nt|chick: oops, there goes the plan for -1 :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|golfergolf: 300 it will be|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: I think the team captain is a hairdresser|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: well if this the real auction I am surprised north didn't bid 4@H over 2@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: that diamond duck seems a nec. precaution|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: and this is going to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: That's true|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: -2 is still better than 3@H making though|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Can S really have a club honour after the overcall?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|vugraphzwe: E didn't like that N discarded|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's only hope is Kx @C onside... no joy there|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: the grand slam hand (bid to six here) was played in 4@h next door|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after a 2@H opening|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: went to fast, he made it|pg||
nt|sybarra: that N hand is too good for 2 @H unless you are playing some intermediate 2 |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 21|pg||
nt|vbman: cant recover if he plays a royal|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|chick: an overcall on a 10-high suit, too|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ahd to try a @d|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: accurate defence..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a handicap tournament, so the 22 IMPs Frissan got because they are ranked lower than Peking|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: singelton @h,3@s and 9 cards in minors|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ,,or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is all they get for the entire match|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|lml: it didnt cost anything|pg||
nt|harmon: thats makes auction easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: indeed|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: no he had no choice but to play pard for Q or it would have cost not to try it|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understnad how third @d not cashed|pg||
mc|9|nt|sommer: wow..he was in for a sec|pg||

nt|danilo1: OK|pg||

nt|sommer: hi Tony|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: yes, he did|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Some scoring issues|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: anyway your prediction worked out right after all, Mike|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: NS did not discuss anything about the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: was not a difficuolt prediction to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thanks to William, our wonderful operator,  Job well done |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks also to Tony Wilkinson (Scotland), Harmon Edgar, and Henry Bethe (USA), for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and ...|pg||

nt|sommer: 4@D EW is max here|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|vugraphzwe: my pleasure|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Almost the end now, so time for a few words of thanks: to our excellent operator William Hernebrink, to the Swedish Bridge Federation's Ostra Mellansvenska District,  and to Carl ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzwe: @dT lead -promisse higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  There must be some mysterious reason that North cannot be properly punished for entering the auction|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: can you imagine comparison?  +400,  "we passed it out" |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwe: my pleasure :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 22 flat, it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm north  alittlemore optimistic than open room counterpart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "What did they go eight off in?"|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks normal to reach layout unfrioendly|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe difficult in opps "suit":)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north has opened an artificial suit in then game which e/wcan make|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 6@C is quite a good contract - basically, you just need to organize two heart ruffs, and it's doable|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|lestergold: and they arebn notm even in the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: funny game bridge|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|golfergolf: Nice to be with yoy, my first time on comment|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess this is how South runs with a one suited hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  Also, thank yous to SBF's Ostra Nellansvenka District and Carl Ragnarsson for putting this venue up for us.|pg||
nt|sommer: guess, if 2NT from E wouldnt be minors...?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: now west must find that @d switch to beat this|pg||
nt|pelu: let se if defense better here - in OR 3x@C and the @D-loses away|pg||
nt|andyv:  Finally, thanks to Nigel for keeping me awake and to all the specs who joined us.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: fair queston |pg||
nt|sybarra: *question |pg||

nt|mdgraham: trenchant 3@c by South|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: once again, my pleasure, hope to see you all later.|pg||
nt|lestergold: pne of those hands tho where defence needs to play very carefully|pg||
nt|lml: its going to be close|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You're on the way Germ!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They rather seem to be on THEIR way as well (N/S)|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead may let this thru|pg||
nt|lml: the spot cards are kind of working for south|pg||
nt|henryb:  And here I was thinking that it should be unnecessary to reach 3N with a misfitting combined 24 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/wnot vul|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: should be, and should have been..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: declarferf can make 2@s 4 @hs 2 @d and a club|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
nt|lestergold: should do when he can tell that a club is going tio be estabklushed and has indeed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks William|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think the next match is in 40 minutes or so |pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: I must admit that after 4@h by West nothing would stop me as East |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in about 25 min (or before) |pg||
nt|sybarra: scheduled time is 5:55 am Los Angeles, 8:55 am New York, 14.55 Paris, 1:55 pm London|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 6 and 5 card suits about and fair inermediates i think 3n is normal|pg||
nt|lml: the @C9 and S!9 were big cards|pg||
nt|lml: thats why they bid it|pg||
nt|lml: @S9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: next set due to start shortly|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are definitely making it and another good one for Mach|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so team Mach win, congrats to them|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think some would have been in with the east out in the pass out position|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nigel_k:  Thanks Andy and William|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: needed a passive defence but got a very busy defence|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: This is the last hand of this session.  Many thanks to our excellent operator Magnus Berg, and to the Filbyter Bridge Club (Carl Ragnarsson) for bringing us this prestigious ...|pg||
nt|chick: Swedish event!!   Hope to see you all back for the second session in about 20 minutes.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to Jill Mellstrom and Ralf Willquist for their excellent commentary :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  see ya all in 20|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E had a difficult bid, D may loose the 5-3 heart fit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Great stuff - their slam bidding has been superb this set|pg||
nt|golfergolf: In no time|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have done a bit of ducking|pg||
nt|sommer: I would dare 2NT, I guess|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: looks like 2nt asked second suit, as it would in forcing stayman|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So win the club and play a heart, win the club continuation, and you can easily ruff two hearts high, using @DK and @SA as entries for the last heart ruff and to draw the last ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Yes, that's true, they have given up the game-try and instead they try to make it easier to bid to the best game/slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: duck the first spade and duck the first heart when it comes|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Yes, 16:35 local time|pg||
