mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|kiwibridge: Martin Reid and Tom Jacob top NZ players|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Is E's 2@c completely artificial or just might have shorter clubs than diamonds, does anyone know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  price would have been right|pg||

nt|janm: We've been having some discussions about what Vugraph operators are supposed to do about things like revokes - should we say something ever?|pg||
mb|d|nt|janm: No, BBO won't let you revoke|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I think they should for vugraph|pg||
nt|andyv:  because those things actually happen in real life.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Jane superb on vugraph, thanks Andy Jan and David, thks audience and we;ll see you again soon in a match yet to be decided :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  ty Gary, Jan, David, Jane and specs for joining us... it's been fun.|pg||
nt|janm: The question is whether the operator is supposed to report it, either to the Director later or to the table at the time - the ACBL Laws Committee has said that operators should ...|pg||
nt|janm: report if the players state a score that is wrong given the tricks actually taken, but haven't yet decided about revokes|pg||
nt|andyv:  N bought this for 3@d in CR|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: Hirst still shows as leading by 3.5 after 7|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should have  been able to bid 3@c (P/C) over dbl|pg||
nt|dburn: how did he get .5?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: carry over|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  it would seem that revokes are still the players responsibility|pg||
nt|dburn: disappointing - I thought it might have been his natural charm|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Imanual and Neill both had .5 after the qualifying|pg||

nt|frankaus: NZ come here and suceed - even our rugby team (wallasbies) has a NZ coach|pg||
mb|1N|nt|raghavan: tx|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|dburn: declarer had, in effect, five of the last four tricks - even a trump lead would not have beaten him|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@D & @H/@S   2@H = pass or correct|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: difficult to find trump lead  even though auction screams for one|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: tough decision for South - could get involved in an auction starting 2@c-2@d-3@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: but those auctions are usually horrific|pg||
nt|dburn: or, could treat her hand as strong balanced|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|dburn: or could do what she did - open 1@d and hope that if partner passed, she didn't miss a game|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: must confess @C wouldn't have been my 2nd choice of suit to lead|pg||

pc|c3|nt|dburn: you'd like to play 4@s every day of the week on these cards, but....|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|dburn: ...what with the position of the diamond honors, you might not make it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if not @D -- @SA seems like 2nd choice|pg||

nt|raghavan: Bd 9 they stopped in 2c -there was no 4H so some points to Hirst|pg||
