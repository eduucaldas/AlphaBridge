nt|toobad: another|pg||
nt|dburn: London buses, these - you wait all day for a slam, then three come along at once|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a bit of a 5 or 7 deal on a @s lead|pg||
nt|mamos: mmmmm|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but in six you might cash two clubs and play hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  except the doubleton @dQ may come to the rescue|pg||
nt|dburn: perecentages not at all easy to calculate|pg||
nt|mamos: have you got an envelope handy David?|pg||
nt|dburn: though certainly you should not neglect the extra chance in diamonds, so not a "true" five or seven hand|pg||

nt|dburn: not surprising, perhaps, in view of weak 2@s opening by South|pg||
nt|toobad: the thing to do, if you are only in 5!!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  midly surprised that East did not add on a point for the 10-9 of @h |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|dburn: still, no one will bid a slam now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a poor contract|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability is going to make this board less interesting than it might|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  West is hoping for a 6th @s but optimistic even then|pg||
nt|idc: Lose patience on potential slam hand and use Blackwood |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West should have responded 2NT and so not felt the need to take control later|pg||
nt|dburn: chance for Northern Ireland - right defence not all that far-fetched|pg||
pc|d2|nt|idc: Yes, the 2@c bid left them stuck a little over 2@s|pg||

nt|idc: In the other room, SOuth led @s2 v 3NT, and North put in @s9|pg||

nt|dburn: still, it's a bidders' game, and North-South certainly play it that way|pg||

pc|c7|nt|mamos: The English EW  are both experienced and perhaps less "excitable" than many JUniors  Id expect a reasonably steady performance from them|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  South dozing|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  double dummy I can see how to make it: knock out the @hA, cash @h/@c winners and exit with 3rd @d|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - declarer wasn't going to run the four, although he would have made some kind of history if he had|pg||
pc|cK|nt|idc: A guess declarer may be able to put pressure on North, who is holding most of the defensive values|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is leading twice towards the hearts in case North has A-x|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to duck a spade to North to keep an entry|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|idc: All eggs in 3-3 @c split basket, not that I can blame West for that|pg||

nt|mamos: wow the hand shave been enormous in this set|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@h looks rather better than 6NT|pg||
nt|dburn: seems odd that the score should be only 7-3 - these boards have had the potential for it to be 47-43|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: East had better not fall in love with his hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|toobad: some difference in the speed of this and the Camrose|pg||

nt|mamos: Becky not prepared to sell out to 2@S|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: s would love to defend s here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  double is presumably a game try|pg||
nt|idc: I like to play that as a game-try dbl, I do hope N-S don't|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: not alerted but presumably a game try|pg||
nt|dburn: why - can they beat three hearts?|pg||
nt|mamos: i was wondering if it was alerted but remembered that its EBL regs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: why does s not push vul opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: s should be bidding 3c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he knows n is almost certainly void in s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Stephen Peterkin, welcome to you too|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|dburn: come to that, can they beat four hearts?|pg||
nt|idc: Take your point David but I was worrying that any pair who think South has a game try|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: no doubles alertable in Scotland...|pg||
nt|idc: may also think North has an accept :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not "on top" - suppose East led his singleton spade against 6@h|pg||
nt|idc: even the 3rd best slam, 6@s, should be ok|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the best contract is six hearts by South, but that might be a bit difficult to organise|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  @h lead best as cards lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but West may score a @c ruff to make up the club trick lost on the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: @CQ   is an interesting lead|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the -2 in OR came when South didn't have trump control to set up a long club trick|pg||
nt|dburn: he may, but this lead may also have lost a tempo - declarer would have problems keeping control on a heart lead|pg||
nt|mamos: (is fearless the code?)|pg||
nt|idc: whereas this lead should give him that, so perhaps -2 for a flat board|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|mamos: @cQ would have worked better|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: make a lot of tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: played by North, this might be closer to a five or seven deal than the previous candidate|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that West did not double 5@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is trying to work out whether 6@c shows no kings or the @cK?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|idc: good catch - I suspect that he was asleep (understandably given the hour)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 5NT asks for Kings  odd time for \south to be thinking|pg||
nt|toobad: i think they are all just v tired|pg||
nt|toobad: 7 now!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  given how quickly they play, it would have been possible to arrange the schedule for an earlier finish |pg||
nt|dburn: seven? if North believes South's bidding, she should bid at least eight|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: and ew will almost certainly bid 3d|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamonds plays well for East  -- and a heck of a lot better thaN @s|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: not ridiculous to try for game with the South cards - those kings look well placed (though one of them isn't)|pg||
nt|toobad: wow|pg||
nt|mamos: it is exhausting watching Junior bridge emotions fluctuate wildly  brilliance turns to idiocy and then back again in a twinkling  |pg||
pc|d9|nt|yorkbeach:  anyone who has been following the snooker, it is heading for a last frame decider between Selby and Maguire - not that we want to stop you from watching here :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|mamos: THOUGH THIS IS NOT SO GOOD|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East did well to read the lead|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mamos: East could just have tried to cash top cards because North had to ruff with winners|pg||
nt|toobad: good to see Richard thinking about best defence|pg||
nt|idc: except for 'brilliance' you could be talking about any of my games|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sJ|nt|idc: Well, no UCB 2@d by partner, so it is a little pushy|pg||
nt|dburn: facing three trumps to the queen and clubs headed by A10 or K10, game would have reasonable play|pg||
nt|dburn: so trying for game is only mildly fearless|pg||

nt|dburn: Robson and Segal's book ought not to be allowed to be read by people under 25|pg||

nt|toobad: or they bid a filthy 2c lol|pg||
nt|mamos: I do think double is completely wrong  - Pass is fine  - even 2@C  but double will shows 4 Hearts in my (humble!!) opinion  and more Diamonds and just asks for trouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is heading to a nasty score for ireland|pg||
nt|mamos: I bet  NOrth wishes hed bid the filthy 2@C  then he'd be playing it rather than North in a filthy 3@d|pg||
nt|toobad: as the cards ly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i couldnt agree more about a x of spades. it MUST show hearts|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  I can see that a partnership between Marc Smith and David is not about to happen - Marc loves raising with three|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 11 and 12 have yet to be scored, and Northern Ireland have about 20 IMPs worth of plus positions in those|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|idc: for allowing us to bring you the vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|toobad: will N bid 2S?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hope EW do not have the misunderstaning about whether this is a fit jump that we saw earlier|pg||
nt|idc: BGB and their representative Sandra Claridge and Fiona Abbott the Match|pg||

nt|Walddk5: I can understand her way of thinking. Two empty suits, she was scared of notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it must be frustrating for the npcs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they see what the piars can do in practice matches but when it comes to the real thing...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are very inexperienced and playing in front of 500+ specs is pressure|pg||
nt|dburn: good grief|pg||
nt|idc: Manager for the Scottish Bridge Union for letting us cover the event.|pg||
nt|idc: And to my fellow commentators, David, Julian and Mike.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: E unsure about 2@H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: mind you, it might make - South leads a spade, North plays the king, East drops @cQ, etc|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure how they will defeat this|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to get to dummy to get the @c wrong|pg||

nt|mamos: @DK onside but 4-1 trumps will be too much|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jlall: double dummy declarer could do what is known as an intra-finesse, playing low to the 9 in clubs, and then running the Q, picking up Tx or Jx onside. Of course this is double dummy |pg||

nt|toobad: v charitable David|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I thought so|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure - it was all over before I'd had a look at the position after trick three|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  a better slam this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll see|pg||
mb|1H|nt|toobad: you should volunteer for coaching John and slow them down dramatically!!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: oh no not overcal;l vul on that garbage|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  we might have another splinter sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: its the style!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: if East plays auto-splinters, that would be a very good description|pg||
nt|toobad: some start ........... first 2 boards|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: he wasnever taught that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with his Dad, Jonny Richards is playing them I am sure|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yorkbeach:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|idc: If that's a weak 2, I doubt I'd do anything but pass as East|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Nice Maior he has|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Becky must have seen how well the cards lie!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (sorry)|pg||
nt|mamos: and 3NT is not a good idea  (even if it makes)|pg||

nt|idc: The cards certainly do lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s is weak but max is 11|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wales have a complete dearth of juniors such that they have had to make an U25 side out of their U25s and U20s. Accordingly, no Wales in the Peggy Bayer (U20)|pg||
nt|idc: That explains the enquiry from East then|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am not sure whether this pair could play in U20s|pg||
nt|idc: for many Juniors, an 11 count is an average strength 1 opening :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Harris-Richards could play U20s this year|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  for results|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  I think it must be a connection problem|pg||

nt|toobad: i'm coaching for Lady Milne and one of them overcalled a worse suit than that 2 weeks ago|pg||
nt|dburn: is his Dad allowed to play in the Junior Camrose?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  With a full 15 HCP outside of clubs, West should insist on a slam|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  East is a little mystifed as he is looking at the @sQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  West is presumably trying to show extras|pg||
nt|idc: indeed, I expect West has shown the @sQ and East is wondering if two Queens of @s will threaten slam|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|idc: You may have heard the expression "duplication of values" - I guess both E & W having @sQ counts as that|pg||

nt|jlall: EW have a huge result in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: no, i dont have their CC online|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: ok :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well i think we can safely congratulate team Laffineur on a very good win - well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: win each board by 4000 point difference|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Vugraphzyf: 2@D = 5 @H in a weak hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|2N!|an|weak !c|nt|hedyg: have never seen 4000, is that possible at all?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jlall: 6D and 6H both make, 6H being a bit better because you might make with 3-2 trumps if the CA is off (and you rightside it, or they don't lead a club)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I would expect most table to end at 4@H only, but 6@H obviously is a very good score|pg||
nt|jlall: but very tough to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: jeremy do you like 2@H or would you jump?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|jjbrr:  i like to go low on this type of auction and bid 2@H only|pg||
nt|jlall: i confess id be tempted :)|pg||
nt|jlall: the void is very nice, but having no aces is bad|pg||
nt|jlall: assuming 4D shows strong diamonds, east still has a problem because he doesn't know which shortness west has...if it is short clubs he can basically claim slam, short spades and he ...|pg||
nt|jlall: has some issues...i expect him to move though|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  the dbl by S makes E unhappy, because AQxx of @S looks less exciting... but W gets very excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe with a 4@S cue hoping to get a club cue from partner, or maybe he will be less scientific hoping to not give away the lead|pg||
nt|jlall: still after the double if you're off cashing clubs probably south has them both so I would not be attempting trickery here :)|pg||
nt|jlall: and of course you could be off the first THREE clubs on a bad day, though that seems pessimistic|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jlall: come on Rosu, 4@S :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|jlall: west admits to his club control|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  looks like theyre off to the races|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jlall: east will bid at least 5@D here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: yes i once conceded such a score 7@HXX = IN ONE ROOM AND 7@SX Iin the other both making on a ruff and discard at trick 1 in each room|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|jlall: west concerned still by his lack of aces, doesn't like the void after 4@S, and has no @HK either|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  in my style i would cuebid 4@C first to show first or second round control; 5@C after 4@S would show first round control|pg||
nt|jlall: east concerned about bad trumps with the likely bad split...|pg||
nt|jlall: still might stop here|pg||
nt|jlall: i will boldly predict a pass from east :) maybe he shouldn't with the AK of trumps though|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jlall: the jack of trumps is so huge here|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jlall: so is the jack of diamodns to a lesser degree...maybe west should have done more with both of those|pg||
nt|jlall: what do you think jeremy?|pg||
nt|jlall: reasonable? or who should have bid more?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jjbrr:  i really want to assign the blame to west, but i really think they both made reasonable actions.|pg||
nt|jlall: yes i think its west also|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jjbrr:  4@D is such a space-consuming bid|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: arguing now:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jlall: haha|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jjbrr:  but in fairness his hand isn't really spectacular, so it's hard to assign fault.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jlall: aruging...AFTER the CA lead :)|pg||
nt|jlall: the thing is, once youre in 5, 6 is much better, because if the CA is off 5 might well go down|pg||
nt|jlall: and if it's on, 6 will make|pg||
nt|jlall: so getting to 5 is kind of a disaster|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|h5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jlall: and also south bid of course making the ace very likely to be on|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|h9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Herve Lustman. Great Job! Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators George, Hedy and David ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: for their perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes. Finally, our gratitude to the FFB (Claude Dadoun) for ensuring that this world class event ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: is brought to BBO.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jlall: i think west can kind of expect east to have the aces and kings to drive past game, what else could he have?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jlall: the more i think about it, the more i will assign west the blame for not bidding it at the end over 5D|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jjbrr:  was 4@D such a descriptive bid?|pg||
nt|jlall: if it showed 6-4 then yes, but youre right that its space consuming|pg||
nt|jlall: im not sure if they had the methods to show short spades thoguh|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: and another coffee hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what is 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: F1|pg||
nt|mamos: forcing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like "forcing"|pg||
nt|toobad: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play fcg nt,  E doesnt even have his "thinking"|pg||
nt|toobad: playing 5c majors FNT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: so if this shows 6 Spades  worth 3@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we all prefer double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Just|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|toobad: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: if truly plaing fcg NT  W has to hit the deck to 3 clubs|pg||
nt|toobad: he did|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: East has messed up here I think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: E hand should be something like  x, xxxx, x, qjxxxxx|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|galadriel: yes for me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|galadriel: But no problem for these guys getting to the right spot|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: or x, xxx, xxx, kqxxxx |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West cashes out, NI will take a 1 IMP lead|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West will be hoping NS diamonds are 2-2|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm told NS were recently part of the team that won the Tollemache last weekend|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|galadriel: Maybe only North|pg||
nt|jtr: Might cash now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|toobad: N wont be able to visualise E hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: how could you on that bidding?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: still  only 140 in the OR so no great harm done |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes that is right the North East won the Tolle|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|toobad: none at all |pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: a spec said 4 @S makes,  I am still not sure|pg||

nt|Vugraphzyf: Thanks All :)|pg||
nt|daman: thx everyone|pg||
nt|jlall: 4C obviously is short clubs, is 3S obviously short spades? it should be but you need the agreement|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  if 3@C was a pattern bid, might that have worked better, in general?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|iq007:  inspired double for Popescu to reach 4@h on the previous board|pg||
nt|jlall: it wouldnt have really helped though, east would have been quite turned off by short spades, i was liking their auction until the 5H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|iq007:  they really need some VPs as they are the last team in the group|pg||
nt|iq007:  the last two teams from each series go to B league|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: great slam here i dont think|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm 9@s 2nd entry to N |pg||
mb|3S|nt|iq007:  and the first 2 from each series advance in the semi-finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: bidding 4S is quite strong but typical these days|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jlall: south will catch a raise of spades and just punt out game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hedyg: hard to find the @H lead|pg||
nt|jlall: or not!|pg||
nt|jlall: i find norths pass strange, do you disagree?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: A@S|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I admit I woul bid 2@S after the dbl|pg||
nt|jlall: those jacks are pretty bad but its still 7 points, 3 spades, a ruffing value, white/red...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|d3|nt|jlall: hah, even the delayed raise does it...I think east pushed them there though|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be automatic|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  well. they've made the last guess, which has some merit in competitive auctions.|pg||
nt|jlall: I am not sure why east bid 4@D either|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: yes, and i also think that supp part in @s is holy:)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  and in this case does quite well.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: if you dont play the A@S you never know what is going on|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jlall: when RHO bids 4@D you just bid 4@S since it might be a save if 4@D makes, and who knows you might make... if RHO passes it's different, he still might have bid though expecting ...|pg||
nt|jlall: partner to have 2 spades and some values, likelyy in clubs given the auction|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  note the other table did quite well with the NS cards also; not sure why EW were so timid. Is 5m very expensive insurance?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|hedyg: Quantin played A@S after J@C ducked|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iq007:  What are your choices here? K lead or small @c?|pg||
nt|iq007:  If the K is lead you are subject to a bath coup (declearer will play small to remain in control)|pg||
nt|iq007:  small-big is 2-0 until now :)|pg||
nt|iq007:  it depends also on what signals have you discussed with your partner, I prefer to give attitude on Q lead and count on K lead|pg||
nt|zensuni: 2@c by Chelu doesn't make @c lead too appealing though|pg||
nt|rocketer: K@C|pg||
nt|iq007:  So from KQ I can lead both K or Q, Q from something like KQx and K from strong holdings which asks unblock, then count|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|zensuni: K definetely looks better if @C lead, or rusinow Q|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|s3|nt|rocketer: 3NT=|pg||
nt|iq007:  7 is a count signal|pg||
nt|jlall: red/white it is quite expensive yes|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@S? really?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Hervé?|pg||
