nt|daman: can you imagine    EW were not in the auction at all in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes i can, unlike French players to overcall with the E hand|pg||
nt|ady: not everyone overcalls 2@C with east hand   so then e/w wont be in contention|pg||

nt|jlall: assuming it goes spot on your right you have a complete guess the next time, and are basically not better than 50/50 there. I do not know about EW lead style but most people lead a ...|pg||
nt|jlall: higher spot from 4 small and if that was the case it would be 100 % to play the ten. |pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: well this looks definitely the end|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: you think they wont bid slam?|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jlall: so you might confuse the matter|pg||
nt|jlall: and if your partner has a strong hand, you might make a game|pg||

nt|jjbrr:  I would categorize it as medium. The shape isnt good. the suit isn't great. but it hasn't a strong outside feature which lifts it up.|pg||
nt|jlall: my impression of romanians is that they are very aggressive though so I am surprised by that evaluation|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: i dont see how this is a min hand, in any system:)|pg||
nt|jlall: is it possible they play 2D as weak multi and 2M as constructive?|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: well i think we can safely congratulate team Laffineur on a very good win - well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: win each board by 4000 point difference|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|Vugraphzyf: 2@D = 5 @H in a weak hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: have never seen 4000, is that possible at all?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: 6D and 6H both make, 6H being a bit better because you might make with 3-2 trumps if the CA is off (and you rightside it, or they don't lead a club)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I would expect most table to end at 4@H only, but 6@H obviously is a very good score|pg||
nt|jlall: but very tough to bid|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|jlall: i agree|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jlall: jeremy do you like 2@H or would you jump?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jjbrr:  i like to go low on this type of auction and bid 2@H only|pg||
nt|jlall: i confess id be tempted :)|pg||
nt|jlall: the void is very nice, but having no aces is bad|pg||
nt|jlall: assuming 4D shows strong diamonds, east still has a problem because he doesn't know which shortness west has...if it is short clubs he can basically claim slam, short spades and he ...|pg||
nt|jlall: has some issues...i expect him to move though|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  the dbl by S makes E unhappy, because AQxx of @S looks less exciting... but W gets very excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe with a 4@S cue hoping to get a club cue from partner, or maybe he will be less scientific hoping to not give away the lead|pg||
nt|jlall: still after the double if you're off cashing clubs probably south has them both so I would not be attempting trickery here :)|pg||
nt|jlall: and of course you could be off the first THREE clubs on a bad day, though that seems pessimistic|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jlall: come on Rosu, 4@S :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jlall: west admits to his club control|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  looks like theyre off to the races|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jlall: east will bid at least 5@D here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: yes i once conceded such a score 7@HXX = IN ONE ROOM AND 7@SX Iin the other both making on a ruff and discard at trick 1 in each room|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|jlall: west concerned still by his lack of aces, doesn't like the void after 4@S, and has no @HK either|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  in my style i would cuebid 4@C first to show first or second round control; 5@C after 4@S would show first round control|pg||
nt|jlall: east concerned about bad trumps with the likely bad split...|pg||
nt|jlall: still might stop here|pg||
nt|jlall: i will boldly predict a pass from east :) maybe he shouldn't with the AK of trumps though|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jlall: the jack of trumps is so huge here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jlall: so is the jack of diamodns to a lesser degree...maybe west should have done more with both of those|pg||
nt|jlall: what do you think jeremy?|pg||
nt|jlall: reasonable? or who should have bid more?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  i really want to assign the blame to west, but i really think they both made reasonable actions.|pg||
nt|jlall: yes i think its west also|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jjbrr:  4@D is such a space-consuming bid|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzzn: arguing now:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jlall: haha|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jjbrr:  but in fairness his hand isn't really spectacular, so it's hard to assign fault.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|jlall: aruging...AFTER the CA lead :)|pg||
nt|jlall: the thing is, once youre in 5, 6 is much better, because if the CA is off 5 might well go down|pg||
nt|jlall: and if it's on, 6 will make|pg||
nt|jlall: so getting to 5 is kind of a disaster|pg||

nt|jlall: 4C obviously is short clubs, is 3S obviously short spades? it should be but you need the agreement|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  if 3@C was a pattern bid, might that have worked better, in general?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|iq007:  inspired double for Popescu to reach 4@h on the previous board|pg||
nt|jlall: it wouldnt have really helped though, east would have been quite turned off by short spades, i was liking their auction until the 5H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|iq007:  they really need some VPs as they are the last team in the group|pg||
nt|iq007:  the last two teams from each series go to B league|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: great slam here i dont think|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm 9@s 2nd entry to N |pg||
mb|4C|nt|iq007:  and the first 2 from each series advance in the semi-finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: bidding 4S is quite strong but typical these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: south will catch a raise of spades and just punt out game|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|hedyg: hard to find the @H lead|pg||

nt|jlall: i find norths pass strange, do you disagree?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@S|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I admit I woul bid 2@S after the dbl|pg||
nt|jlall: those jacks are pretty bad but its still 7 points, 3 spades, a ruffing value, white/red...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|jlall: hah, even the delayed raise does it...I think east pushed them there though|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be automatic|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  well. they've made the last guess, which has some merit in competitive auctions.|pg||
nt|jlall: I am not sure why east bid 4@D either|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: yes, and i also think that supp part in @s is holy:)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  and in this case does quite well.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: if you dont play the A@S you never know what is going on|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jlall: when RHO bids 4@D you just bid 4@S since it might be a save if 4@D makes, and who knows you might make... if RHO passes it's different, he still might have bid though expecting ...|pg||
nt|jlall: partner to have 2 spades and some values, likelyy in clubs given the auction|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  note the other table did quite well with the NS cards also; not sure why EW were so timid. Is 5m very expensive insurance?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|hedyg: Quantin played A@S after J@C ducked|pg||
pc|c3|nt|iq007:  What are your choices here? K lead or small @c?|pg||
nt|iq007:  If the K is lead you are subject to a bath coup (declearer will play small to remain in control)|pg||
nt|iq007:  small-big is 2-0 until now :)|pg||
nt|iq007:  it depends also on what signals have you discussed with your partner, I prefer to give attitude on Q lead and count on K lead|pg||
nt|zensuni: 2@c by Chelu doesn't make @c lead too appealing though|pg||
nt|rocketer: K@C|pg||
nt|iq007:  So from KQ I can lead both K or Q, Q from something like KQx and K from strong holdings which asks unblock, then count|pg||
