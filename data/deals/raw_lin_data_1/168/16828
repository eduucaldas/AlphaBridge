nt|toobad: after 3d a 3h bid would gather a 3s cue and then i think 6h is a good punt, but they knew it was on a hook at best|pg||
nt|sybarra: unless someone just blasts into it |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card does say 1st discard is suit preference|pg||
nt|jtr: Was very tough|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better to have a defensive misunderstanding when only an overtrick is at stake|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 3NT|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: obviously no heart lead in open|pg||

nt|sybarra: one of those hands |pg||
nt|toobad: indeed ........... a C would have fared no better|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a shapely deal|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one good 3N missed and one bad one bid by n/s so not a great start|pg||
nt|toobad: 3c was presumably some sort of minor try so 3N a surprising choice of contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Tricky for North to bid 2NT over the Multi with no spade stopper|pg||
nt|jtr: East might have bid more but were fearful of partner having a strong option|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: South a little light for 2NT perhaps...|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jbgood: Hauge seem to have recovered after 2 losses and make a challenge if Gillis lose by let us say 11-19.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hard to see this ending up in anything other than 4 @H, making, or possibly 3 NT|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@c shows shortage|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C shortness I assume |pg||
nt|mamos: they may bid this now|pg||
nt|toobad: 6 now or Blackwood?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what now? |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: No nonsense!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  nice to have one of my predictions come true :)|pg||
nt|toobad: 4 h more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: no hurry, quite rightly|pg||
nt|sybarra: the delicate approach |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  standard play in diamonds - top from North first|pg||
nt|lestergold: very good 5 @d tricks always likely 2 top spades  and a likely trick in clubs or hearts etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: i think someone will just bid it soon though|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: i mean 2 tricksm out od clubs and nhearts one way or the other likkely|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: serious 3 nt|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bessi2: i wonder what 3@h means|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the cue bids go on |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|nicksan: I wonder if a trump lead from South could break it? This, however, won't do it.|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 2 @c was @ds, perhaps W just showed his distribution?|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lay it could not fail|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bessi2: i think a trump beats it Nick|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the last board of this weekend, and some thanks are due.  Thank you operator operator Hrafnhildur, for your tireless efforts during these days. Well done indeed! And thanks ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: to sponsor Iceland Express and Bridgesamband Íslands (Ólöf),  for making it possible for us to watch the this exciting bridge live.  And of course thanks to BBO and Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|nicksan: yes, think so. E/W getting rewarded here for not mentioning the Clubs in the bidding|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: its the shape of W hand that has not been made clear to E|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|nt|jbgood: Also thank you Nick Sandqvist (who has been here all the time) and all the other commentators who have provided us with expert opinions and analyses. |pg||
nt|nicksan: Thanks Jon, and yourself of course (as well as all the others)|pg||
nt|jbgood: Last, but not least, a big thank you to the audience, your inputs are always appreciated.|pg||
nt|toobad: oops|pg||
nt|mamos: two key cards missing|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam needs the k of @H on side or dropping |pg||
nt|toobad: clearly v steady players. a reasonable auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Keri (N) thinking she has 2 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|toobad: i've just been told that W played for Scotland in the Europeans last year|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|h4|nt|yorkbeach:  Stopping the overtrick will require West to keep all the clubs|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a lot of pairs would be  in it |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|jtr: No so easy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: Not|pg||
nt|toobad: +1 on S return |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mamos: I dont think it's an auction that can be criticised  - 50% 50% you only want to be in it if it's making lol|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could h!9 be suit preference to show the @sJ?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|sT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|nicksan: Declarer certain clubs are not 5-1 or the defence would have taken ruffs..|pg||
mc|11|nt|nicksan: Bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: Thanks to everyone for a good weekend!|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all - and congrats to Gillis! (?) Dont think they can lose on the 2 hands not compared|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h9|pg||
