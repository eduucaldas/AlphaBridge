nt|mdgraham: I feel there is something bad happening here|pg||
nt|idc: hmmm, we never considered 6@s, or 6 NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  of course South thinks North has 4 spades|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N wants to bid 5N pick a slam|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6NT is OK as the cards lie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hard to blame him|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Hello|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that is the name of the convention|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yorkbeach:  there was a book 'from Helms to Hello'|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I guess NS have read it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: Hmmm, a sign you are bidding a bit too much when the cards lie well so you are only -2 in your contract|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: think A@S a better lead|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Nothing breaks or sits well for 3NT |pg||

nt|jcomyn: be jaypers|pg||
nt|lestergold: ami  seeing things?|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|rmb1: I prefer rebidding 1NT with a balanced hand, rather than 1@H, but "other agreements are possible"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: apparently|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: is this the late night game at my club/|pg||

nt|toobad: if I was S I would not be happy!!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that diamond shift was too busy - continue clubs and 3N just goes off|pg||
nt|sybarra: must remember pard heard the bidding also |pg||
nt|sybarra: (meaning the club lead was for a reason)|pg||
nt|toobad: when you find the right lead and P thinks he is smarter, Grrrrrrrrrrrr|pg||
nt|rmb1: Was that the last board?  Thanks to SBU and vugraph operator.  Thanks to fellow commentators John Mike and SHirely|pg||
nt|toobad: ty all......... good luck|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought we had 2 more to 36 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be - 12 board sets|pg||
nt|rmb1: We played 35 and 36 before the 9 card suit on 25|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe S beating up N|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  does anyone know whether Scotland are close to catching England (only 2 VP behind at start)?|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzwp: you quessed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|idc: I've asked the Operators if they could find out the score, keep at least one of the tables open and let us know|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@c = @d or major/minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Q@S   andf K@D  also well place    but defence can take 4 heart tricks and A@C  against no-trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzwp: ok|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so South has shown @h + minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: last Bd at this table, so time to thank some people:|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: To our Vugraph Operator Christine Walker, BGB representative Sandra Claridge,|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: Match Manager Fiona Abbott and SBU Ayrshire District who are running the event.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: all you spectators, without whom we'd be typing to ourselves.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what goes on here?|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|ady: lead may have given contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  still prefer 2@h doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a Marshall Miles hand where he raised 2DX to 3D so the doubled contract would be game|pg||
mc|8|nt|yorkbeach:  goodbye everyone|pg||
nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzwp: Apologies for our difficulties |pg||

nt|mdgraham: well done Christine, fine job |pg||
nt|idc: if not, keep an eye on the results page at: http://www.ayrshirebridge.co.uk/|pg||
nt|vugraphzwp: W bid 3C|pg||
nt|vugraphzwp: result pending an appeal|pg||
nt|idc: 4 IMPs is 16-14 to Scotland in this match, so England need 15-15 draw to be sure|pg||
nt|idc: The Peggy Bayer was already won by England some time ago - congratulations to them|pg||
nt|idc: The burning question in the Peggy Bayer is can England win with a maximum 25 in last round, as they did in all the other 8 rounds, an incredible effort|pg||
nt|idc: While we are waiting - Alistair Ross points out that both England & Scotland in Junior Camrose have won 7 out of 8 matches, so well done to them both|pg||
nt|idc: At least, that is true if England win their last match v N.Ireland|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the Scotland supporters will be rooting for the Irish :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwp: The appeals committee is about to form in this room so I will have to leave|pg||
