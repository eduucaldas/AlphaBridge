nt|sybarra: hello Stephen and all |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ayrshirebridge.co.uk/|pg||
nt|toobad: another|pg||
nt|dburn: London buses, these - you wait all day for a slam, then three come along at once|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a bit of a 5 or 7 deal on a @s lead|pg||
nt|mamos: mmmmm|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but in six you might cash two clubs and play hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  except the doubleton @dQ may come to the rescue|pg||
nt|dburn: perecentages not at all easy to calculate|pg||
nt|mamos: have you got an envelope handy David?|pg||
nt|dburn: though certainly you should not neglect the extra chance in diamonds, so not a "true" five or seven hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  must have got the clubs wrong at the other table|pg||
nt|toobad: You seem to have drawn the short straw with your connection Stephen|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: back to spelling classes...|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks for catching up|pg||
nt|dburn: not surprising, perhaps, in view of weak 2@s opening by South|pg||
nt|toobad: the thing to do, if you are only in 5!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  midly surprised that East did not add on a point for the 10-9 of @h |pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: mmm...|pg||
nt|idc: I see East rather panicked in 3NT last hand, played @d from hand and went one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: play lost in connection error|pg||
nt|mamos: 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|toobad: a quiet pass by west|pg||
nt|mamos: EW seem to have been too passive here|pg||
nt|sybarra: West not a fun hand to lead from |pg||
nt|mamos: and are maybe a bit lucky that game is not making their way|pg||
nt|toobad: d would be good, but prob AS|pg||
nt|mamos: as it happens West  cannot do much harm |pg||

nt|idc: Hard to see this one not being flat as well|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round there will be a long break for dinner. Restart at 20.00 local time, in about 3 hours and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have a lot of high cards but poor shape and two top @d losers|pg||
nt|mamos: bet you didnt expect @d9 to win last trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability is going to make this board less interesting than it might|pg||
nt|dburn: one thing about these players - they have a refreshing attitude towards getting on with the game|pg||
nt|idc: v 4@h North needs to switch to @d at trick 2, continued @c in OR and declarer had 10|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - we should be finished in time to watch the highlights of the 1st world cup game|pg||
nt|toobad: no time penalties!|pg||
nt|toobad: lightening play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does other room result look right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toobad: sounds good Guthi|pg||
nt|idc: A point of technique on this hand:|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT agrees spades|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: looks goofy |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: in 4@s on say trump or @h or @c lead: draw trump, eliminate side suits finishing in dummy|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  card also says that 2NT shows slam interest - maybe West thought he was not good enough |pg||
nt|idc: then a @d to Q and claim - South endplayed even if they began with AK @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  true - but most of the time South has dxA-K he will lead one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dA-K|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: seems to think he has now :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|idc: Of course, they might have led one from @dAK, but no reason not to play it properly :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Do not understand this bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|toobad: n might pass this, nope|pg||
nt|mamos: oh its the terrorist 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North will need to switch to a @d at trick two to stop the overtrick|pg||
nt|idc: spotlight on North then...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  results |pg||
mb|3C|nt|idc: Many players go through this stage in their bridge careers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is hoping for a 6th @s but optimistic even then|pg||
nt|idc: Lose patience on potential slam hand and use Blackwood |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West should have responded 2NT and so not felt the need to take control later|pg||
nt|dburn: chance for Northern Ireland - right defence not all that far-fetched|pg||
nt|sybarra: lebs |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Yes, the 2@c bid left them stuck a little over 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: West is worth no more than a "sound raise " to 4@S  some pairs play 3NT shows this sort of hand as  response to 1M|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: declarer not looking too aghast...|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: not overtrick - for the contract|pg||
nt|dburn: and it might even stop the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Jones's 2@C shows a weak hand without Clubs |pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: i think they said it was minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and includes one major?|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  three rounds of clubs at other table too|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about that @c8 - seemed to be a half-way house between shwoing count and discouraging|pg||
nt|dburn: but a more usual attitude @c5 might have got the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  foul @d split here|pg||
nt|idc: if playing attitude perhaps she thought @cT might have suit preference overtones|pg||
nt|idc: sorry, meant reverse attitude|pg||
nt|dburn: if playing attitude, your cards do not have "suit preference overtones" - this isn't Humpty Dumpty bridge|pg||

nt|toobad: Scotland on a roll|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: OK ...Let's hope connection holds up a little now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  East was probably wondering whether West is showing a hand too good to open 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks Stephen - a slight overbid then if GF|pg||
nt|idc: In the other room, SOuth led @s2 v 3NT, and North put in @s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only 8 tricks in view (and that is with @h 3-3)|pg||
nt|idc: so the 10 won trick one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idc: Any thoughts on North's dbl?   I quite like it opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  the right shape certianly|pg||
nt|dburn: don't mind it at these colours, but might tip declarer to a line he would not otherwise find|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: still, it's a bidders' game, and North-South certainly play it that way|pg||
nt|mamos: might misplace @SK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos: The English EW  are both experienced and perhaps less "excitable" than many JUniors  Id expect a reasonably steady performance from them|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes = declarer needs to duck the 1st @s really|pg||
pc|h5|nt|toobad: should be 2 off |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: could very well do|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South dozing|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: Robertson may make this   but even 1 off will be a couple of imps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  double dummy I can see how to make it: knock out the @hA, cash @h/@c winners and exit with 3rd @d|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - declarer wasn't going to run the four, although he would have made some kind of history if he had|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: A guess declarer may be able to put pressure on North, who is holding most of the defensive values|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is leading twice towards the hearts in case North has A-x|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: close to making but 1 off seems right |pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to duck a spade to North to keep an entry|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|toobad: if he runs 10c he will make it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: still, maybe he should have done - four diamonds, three hearts, one of each black suit...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idc: All eggs in 3-3 @c split basket, not that I can blame West for that|pg||
nt|idc: hmm, North should have covered that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would have been better to play second heart here|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but he needed more time and more entries than he had to set those up|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||

nt|dburn: and very pretty - well done West (if he does it)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  N needed to play more quickly here|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a kind of three-suit strip squeeze without the count|pg||
nt|idc: yes, when you are going to be under pressure best to plan early so you can make crucial discard smoothly|pg||
nt|dburn: and one of these days, I expect to see a full discussion of the topic by Julian Pottage|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  mind you - once South turns up with the @sK North's shape becomes pretty well marked|pg||

nt|idc: I like to play that as a game-try dbl, I do hope N-S don't|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: not alerted but presumably a game try|pg||
nt|dburn: why - can they beat three hearts?|pg||
nt|mamos: i was wondering if it was alerted but remembered that its EBL regs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: why does s not push vul opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: s should be bidding 3c|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Stephen Peterkin, welcome to you too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: come to that, can they beat four hearts?|pg||
nt|idc: Take your point David but I was worrying that any pair who think South has a game try|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: no doubles alertable in Scotland...|pg||
nt|idc: may also think North has an accept :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not "on top" - suppose East led his singleton spade against 6@h|pg||
nt|idc: even the 3rd best slam, 6@s, should be ok|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the best contract is six hearts by South, but that might be a bit difficult to organise|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yorkbeach:  @h lead best as cards lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but West may score a @c ruff to make up the club trick lost on the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: @CQ   is an interesting lead|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the -2 in OR came when South didn't have trump control to set up a long club trick|pg||
nt|dburn: he may, but this lead may also have lost a tempo - declarer would have problems keeping control on a heart lead|pg||
nt|mamos: (is fearless the code?)|pg||
nt|idc: whereas this lead should give him that, so perhaps -2 for a flat board|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a likely push |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: just pesky that spades are 4/1|pg||
nt|toobad: not under enough pressure in 2... 3 would have been more interesting|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: @cQ would have worked better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: make a lot of tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: played by North, this might be closer to a five or seven deal than the previous candidate|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that West did not double 5@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is trying to work out whether 6@c shows no kings or the @cK?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|idc: good catch - I suspect that he was asleep (understandably given the hour)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 5NT asks for Kings  odd time for \south to be thinking|pg||
nt|toobad: i think they are all just v tired|pg||
nt|toobad: 7 now!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  given how quickly they play, it would have been possible to arrange the schedule for an earlier finish |pg||
nt|dburn: seven? if North believes South's bidding, she should bid at least eight|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: and ew will almost certainly bid 3d|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamonds plays well for East  -- and a heck of a lot better thaN @s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: not ridiculous to try for game with the South cards - those kings look well placed (though one of them isn't)|pg||
nt|toobad: wow|pg||
nt|mamos: it is exhausting watching Junior bridge emotions fluctuate wildly  brilliance turns to idiocy and then back again in a twinkling  |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yorkbeach:  anyone who has been following the snooker, it is heading for a last frame decider between Selby and Maguire - not that we want to stop you from watching here :)|pg||

pc|dT|nt|mamos: THOUGH THIS IS NOT SO GOOD|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East did well to read the lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: East could just have tried to cash top cards because North had to ruff with winners|pg||
nt|toobad: good to see Richard thinking about best defence|pg||
nt|idc: except for 'brilliance' you could be talking about any of my games|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|idc: Well, no UCB 2@d by partner, so it is a little pushy|pg||
nt|dburn: facing three trumps to the queen and clubs headed by A10 or K10, game would have reasonable play|pg||
nt|dburn: so trying for game is only mildly fearless|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  considering what some people overcall on non-vul these days South was hugely better than he might be|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: though in fact trump was best|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, West may pull it with his void |pg||

nt|Walddk5: 4@H is  /&%¤ !!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 5@H is ............................|pg||

nt|dburn: Robson and Segal's book ought not to be allowed to be read by people under 25|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East might find a double here but is trying to avoid doing with with undue haste|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: N thinks jump fit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C was stretching my imagination  (even with the new systems)|pg||
nt|toobad: We might be in for a tense finish............. always a good thing|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|idc: tennis is a dangerous game for bridge to ape: Brits never win anything|pg||

nt|toobad: or they bid a filthy 2c lol|pg||
nt|mamos: I do think double is completely wrong  - Pass is fine  - even 2@C  but double will shows 4 Hearts in my (humble!!) opinion  and more Diamonds and just asks for trouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is heading to a nasty score for ireland|pg||
nt|mamos: I bet  NOrth wishes hed bid the filthy 2@C  then he'd be playing it rather than North in a filthy 3@d|pg||
nt|toobad: as the cards ly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i couldnt agree more about a x of spades. it MUST show hearts|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  I can see that a partnership between Marc Smith and David is not about to happen - Marc loves raising with three|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 11 and 12 have yet to be scored, and Northern Ireland have about 20 IMPs worth of plus positions in those|pg||

mb|d|nt|idc: for allowing us to bring you the vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|toobad: will N bid 2S?|pg||

nt|idc: BGB and their representative Sandra Claridge and Fiona Abbott the Match|pg||
nt|mamos: is there a chance of beating  game here?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|idc: and as always, BBO itself and you specs for turning up and putting up with myself & fellow commentators|pg||

nt|mamos: why didnt she just bid 3NT?|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: but it has made for an exciting match for us watching|pg||

nt|Walddk5: I can understand her way of thinking. Two empty suits, she was scared of notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it must be frustrating for the npcs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they see what the piars can do in practice matches but when it comes to the real thing...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are very inexperienced and playing in front of 500+ specs is pressure|pg||
nt|dburn: good grief|pg||
nt|idc: Manager for the Scottish Bridge Union for letting us cover the event.|pg||
nt|idc: And to my fellow commentators, David, Julian and Mike.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: E unsure about 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, it might make - South leads a spade, North plays the king, East drops @cQ, etc|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure how they will defeat this|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  expecting 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|mamos: well Scotland have one more match in hand so something like 21-9 or more to Scotland will leave things pretty level|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mamos: but if England win or hold their own they certainly will be in a strong position|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3NT?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|toobad: they only made 11 in the other room on 8 too........ 12 not easy|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  with diamonds 3-2 and the king onside, this has play|pg||
nt|mamos: @DK onside but 4-1 trumps will be too much|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  entry situation dictates ruffing hearts rather than clubs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  or could be a weak 2@d|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that was an effective lead by S, however obvious......hard for EW to have a plausibvle sequence to get W to play 3N:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  any bets?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  common here to play that double shows 4@h and 2@h shows 5+@h|pg||
nt|chilloncan: weak 2 would be ill-advised......it is an error to both advertise weakness and HAVE weakness when you open in third seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzwp: it was alerted late|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: there are secondary flaws too, such as holding four spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1NT from West is plenty|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: 1NT by West now?|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  awful intermediates and partner is in third seat|pg||

pc|h5|nt|chilloncan: to my Tory eye this S hand does not look much like a takeout double at these colors facing a passed hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|yorkbeach:  East should get a @c ruff but not enough to defeat 2@h|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do you prefer 1@s or pass?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  I would not double either I admit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i would pass|pg||
nt|chilloncan: a million losers and a defensively oriented hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with a minimum values I believe one should be shape suitable|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|chilloncan: slightly more attractive if the opening had been 1C, but even then...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least you have support for all four suits|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|d2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|chilloncan: good point:)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|chilloncan: defense against all four also:)|pg||

mc|9|nt|mdgraham: much better by Scotland this match. Well done. Thanks all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on board 11 4@h made in the other room when North did not continue diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thanks everyone|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzwp: Penultimate session starts 14.55 GMT bye for now|pg||
