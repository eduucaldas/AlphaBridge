nt|ralfwil: Gooe evening everyone!|pg||
nt|chick: NS may end up in a very reasonable 4@S, going down on the bad trump split and offside kings|pg||
nt|jillan:  Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: NS playing natural with 4-card majors and 15-17NT|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Magnus :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Ralf and Jill :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: EW is playing Swedish two-way club with 5-card majors and 14-16NT|pg||
nt|jillan:  Hi COrnelia and Ralf|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Everyone @H@H@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and good evening everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good evening Chick Raif Walter and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Welcome back, NS is playing strong club with a nebulous 1D and 5-card majors, 14-16NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Tony and welcome all |pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon Mike Linda and specs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hello again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: welcome back to Sweden|pg||
nt|garnetts: For me that is a partnership breaker |pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 NT - plyed by North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: you are warming up, David..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  David is right, a stupid way tp trhrow 2 IMPÂ´s like that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  to loose|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: and hello again to William our operator|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  hi Nigel|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Erik is at the other table =)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Hi Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: EW may find a heart contract here|pg||
nt|lestergold: prefer double with E to allow for @hs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=3427  stilling efter 4 runder|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt was weak with minor |pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry for Danish, I am sure you can figure it out|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thinki that is standing after 4 rounds|pg||
mb|3C|an|ART, asking|nt|Walddk4: and good evening to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's a very aggressive double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is there a prize?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wd :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: club lead needed to beat 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  so here we are, now we just have to make it....|pg||
nt|chick: 2N is certainly a forcing raise and 4@S says nothing extra|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, was trying to locate William and typed you in by accident:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Peter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Peter!|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy hand to declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: too bad the hands ae so weak in n/s |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: still time to switch |pg||
nt|lml: South didnt want to lead from anything into the strong hand|pg||
nt|lml: which is good and bad when you are trying to set 1NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or maybe not..|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht void will not escite south!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  is it aggressive or just highly optomistic?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Peking need to claw back into this match |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Mike, would you double 1 club with the west hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably a push now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure Mike, surprised East didn't double 1 spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  East doesn't really have a good lead.|pg||
nt|chick: that lead will help a lot, giving a pitch for a red loser|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can make with correct play. May not play a high @s from the hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: another uninspiring board as far as the play is concerned but of academic interest as North should play 6NT  |pg||
mb|4H|nt|chick: it's true, any lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and after A@h what then?|pg||
nt|pelu: DD a @d|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe not A@h niow|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs an entry to @d if he finds that play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi all, what system are EW playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Some kind of swedish @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: weak bal or strong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, N can get spade ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: don't think so|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rnc: Welcome back to the broadcasting of the 12th Filbyter Cup, Round of 16. We are in the city of Linkoping (with approximately 150.000 inhabitants) at the east coast of Sweden, some ...|pg||
nt|rnc: 200 kilometres south of Stockholm. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@s for me |pg||
nt|lestergold: prefer to give my partner 3 places to play rather than one!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: Some words about the format of this tournament might be needed. Filbyter Cup is a handicap-based tournament. Every player in Sweden has a nation wide handicap, however based on all ...|pg||
nt|rnc: the pairs tournaments the player has played...|pg||
mb|5D|nt|fabsayc: with phantom opening bids, looks more like a forcing pass system|pg||
nt|xenya: no, 1@C can be 15+|pg||
nt|andyv:  our vugraph operator is William|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok spade now from S |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...I'm sure I would..|pg||
nt|garnetts: This overcomes a abd @D break in 6@D if the heart finesse works and also prevents  a killing heart lead if the king was wrong |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: wrong to duck!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...making 12 is going some tho'|pg||
mb|6N|nt|garnetts: well bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Both probably, I was going for the most complimentary description I could think of|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnc: ...A team's hcp is calculated as the average of the players involved in the specific segment. The hcp-average for the two teams is compared and the difference then divided by 10, ...|pg||
nt|rnc: which gives us the number of IMP's per board the 'less skilled' team get as a bonus. As it is a KO-match, even a fraction of an IMP might be important at the end of the match...|pg||
nt|lestergold: a small @d to the T if won by south gets declare3r no where|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Trying|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: rehi Mike :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: both pairs playing strong @c systems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I am not sure how much south is finding out here, but 6NT is fine|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4NT kept seven in the frame--if no aces were missing |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: some explainations comung may well be a good sequence, then|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: heigh ho|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good technique is to try the diamonds first |pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: that @D8 may actually prove to be an important card|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnc: All hcp-IMP's are included in the above shown standings.|pg||
nt|xenya: so 1@C is either a mini NT or a relatively strong hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, I am surprised to discover Peking is a district of Sweden|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: then you will know if you need the heart finesse |pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Germ Kemper, his 2nd segment overall|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s will look at the hand and .....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mutter silently|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a wonderful explanation |pg||
nt|golfergolf: 1up|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: double is more flexible, I must agree|pg||
nt|sommer: restricted choice|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Claim, next|pg||
nt|garnetts: If the ace were wrong and heart returned --how would you know what to do?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: declarfer is going for the endplay|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 180|pg||
pc|d7|nt|nigel_k:  380 now I think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...so reckon this is a good score for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: helped by the 2@d overcall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  12 top-tricks, pls|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here's a good example of the pitfalls of these two-way methods - was it 100% clear to West that East had the "mini"?|pg||
nt|sommer: a lot, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nigel_k:  Maybe not|pg||
nt|sybarra: the teams choose their names |pg||
pc|s2|pc|h6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any bid that can be described as "flexible" always scores maximum marks in bidding competitions|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Without the @D|pg||
mc|12|nt|mdgraham: we thought it was a team from China who got lost at the airport|pg||

nt|andyv:  3N about the max for NS on this hand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Are we sure it was nine tricks, I thought East could claim the rest at the end|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: you mean flexible in an ironic sort of way, then|pg||
nt|garnetts: did I say I could count :)  lol|pg||
nt|garnetts: I haven't had any coffee yet |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but we suspect that, somehow, it is |pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  If this is 12-14, the hand is by far too STRONG|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzwe: 1NT is 0-6 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|golfergolf: OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm they do not seem to like take out doubles here|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: another 1NT - just as well David Bird is not here|pg||
nt|lml: this one wont be quite so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and this one not likely to be successful|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not really - the Bridge World panel use the word quite a lot though|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: it will need some help from the defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: well who0 wouold have expected such an exciting contract to be reached here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: club required, it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think that will be forthcoming|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: your computer...?|pg||
nt|sommer: looks like 2 down on higher steaks|pg||
nt|lestergold: which is rather good for n/s as they cant make much their way|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, tho the 2 Diamonds in CR a strange choice..|pg||
nt|sommer: no, misfit is doublesided almost always:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..2@S would work from N, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: trump?!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If a trump, it should probably be the king ... but I don't think he will|pg||
nt|sybarra: and club is not easy from E is it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not when partner bid spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club switch for the setting trick will become obvious in due course|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this does not look to be too much of a challenge |pg||
nt|sybarra: esp with this lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: hoi Germ |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|lml: declarer is just missing too many aces|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  so board one was actually -380|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: most leads allow 12 tricks, but not this one|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: if 1NT 0-6 then W only car5ds to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Hi shirley and Mike|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: and tough to have 2 suited bid when S bids one of your suits|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: The point of playing the king is that if declarer now ruffs clubs in dummy, one of them will be with the queen, promoting North's trumps back into play|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jillan:  no way this can make now. 3 spades and one H|pg||
nt|jillan:  IF the take them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: welcome|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well a diamond also ok, I suppose|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: declarer may wll be put to the @d guess on the second round of the suit too|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wilkinsona: but south has gone wrong it seems|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sommer: only @C5?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nigel_k:  There aren't enough entries to set up and use the club suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  on this hand, with @ds, behaving, declarer has an easy route to 9 tricks and possibly 10 if he takes the @s hook|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But still nine tricks, or ten with the spade finesse|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: q of @D makes sense|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzwe: N/S CC|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence slightly too busy here I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but nothign was really  obvious|pg||

pc|h2|nt|vugraphzwe: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/cc/sh-ta.pdf|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: now  -3|pg||
nt|lml: from declarer's point of view the club finesse could work|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably playing udca|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk4: udca is standard in Sweden, as are 3rd/5th leads|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also against NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and declarer is feeling the pressure and has given up on further @d tricks|pg||

nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: The reason is that N lead a spade from hand out of turn|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but better is to look for Easts distribution. 5@h and perhaps/probably 4@d. @s can be 4-1|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have saved an imp |pg||
nt|mdgraham: very decent 6@s|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S by North?  after a toy over 1NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again one of my normal rubber-hands in East :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: The 21 IMPs must be some kind of carryover from a previous session|pg||
nt|jillan:  sorry partner I am an idiot is what I would like to say and hear when I screw up|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as cards lie i thinkl 5@d rolls in|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a bit strange since even if it fails he probably wont go 2 down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: 6@d is unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: on a club lead a bit dicey isnt it? |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @S that is |pg||
nt|sommer: +90 is big score for EW in CR|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would feel an overwhelming urge to bid |pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: It seems to me that the @SK switch would in fact have defeated the contract ... that's one to remember|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south need to ruff the third diamond and push throw another club, holds declarer to just spade ace in endgame|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a wild hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: brave 2@S - works well|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzwe: Popular contract|pg||
nt|chick: nah, I don't want to hear that kind of thing ... bridge is a game of mistakes ... would be more interesting to hear his reasoning, even if wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly, but you would expect diamonds and spades to play for twelve tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: he was pretty sure that east would not have played club away from K|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: brave 2 spades by west should be raised|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is wrong with x by east as in closed|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jillan:  maybe they should just bid 4@S directly|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|golfergolf: There goes the Club k=lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that was 4@S by East, I bet|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: is this auction for real?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess East could not bid 3@c forcing after the reverse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good stop|pg||
nt|lml: yes but I still think it was worth a go|pg||
nt|lestergold: as well as the fact that with good spade suit and K@c he might have opened the bidding if he held any more high cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, Hmmmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is content|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 2@s shows @c in their sys|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: brainfreeze|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, Rubens transfers|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks William|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: but w seem to be enjoying his meatballsub atleast :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, but 7 tricks so -1|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jillan:  this has better chance though than the previous one|pg||
nt|chick: why waste time bidding, just set the contract at 4@S for whoever has the longest spades :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but  magnus explanation tells everything|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction seems cumbersome|pg||
nt|lml: yes all of that is true but I hate it when it turns out that for some reason East didn't bid and did have the card|pg||
nt|sommer: 7 ..or maybe 8 tricks ..still 1 imp for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of worl to do here in 2@H|pg||
nt|sommer: there is a chance for 5 imps..especially with this lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: true, though I would have tried 2 clubs over the double from west for less success|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: cross ruff in the defence after a @c or @hA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: my defense works also|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am getting impression n/s at this table are quite conservative |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this wil make |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1 they played 5 @D X at the other table|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: sure..7 seems like max|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  if not playing Lebensohl, E had a problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c is not a think of beauty when 6 is a laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the discard on the A@c is not going to do declarer that much good|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: whre did S find that 3NT bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  thing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: result seems to be 3D-1 insted of 4 spades|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: but the club return will!|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jillan:  yup,simplifies the bidding, and would really show skill. NOT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: he might have gone more off also becaus he still didnt know the lie of the diamonds |pg||
nt|lml: unlikely but possible... East was even less likely to have the DA at that point and even then |pg||
pc|c8|nt|nigel_k:  They needed to agree clubs and start cue bidding to find the @hK then West can bid 6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: eight now though |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: But declarer played weakly as well surely - he should have taken a heart ruff for his 8th trick|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|sommer: was back to 7:)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: yes agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: he aslo saw west signal for a club Linda|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: So to be honest, all three of them will want to forget that hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sommer: ..bua again 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not understand the club return|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not that we are letting them ...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: true it might have been a lie but that was not likely here|pg||
nt|lml: I agree though great stop here.   Probably possible only when West is a passed hand|pg||

nt|andyv:  yes, even up to the 4 level, I wasn't sure on what they had agreed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW must expect a well deserved loss there|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: back to -1, declarer had a chance but needed to read it just right|pg||
nt|sommer: it ended with the predicted 7:)..but shifted between 7 and 8 4-5 times|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has so many clubs they wont fit in the box|pg||
nt|lestergold: with all these esciting distributions about still no game here for anyone|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree I would certainly bid over 1NT |pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+|nt|lestergold: aceless 11 didnt look like a game force hand especially if they open as light as they did at unfave vul|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west can make 3N I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: i tell a lie you cant touch 4@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an|17-19|nt|vugraphzwe: N bid 2NT as invitational but S thought it was GF|pg||

nt|mdgraham: South of Stockholm, on the Baltic coast - very confusing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HA, h ruff, 2 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  anyone ...|pg||
nt|lml: 6@H is more likely and 4 is certainly possible|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4S can go down I think|pg||
nt|sommer: yes it can|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u 4@s played by west is also off  on @h and continuation|pg||
mb|2C!|an|stayman|nt|chick: maybe yet :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  but I think they will swtitch to @H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Clearly E/W are playing a system designed for alpha-males|pg||

nt|sommer: ..but 5@C is obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: surprise E did not bid 3 @S |pg||

nt|lestergold: ic|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: not after this self splinter!|pg||
nt|lml: that is a nice bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, Mrs Guggenheim might be just the player to defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could transfer to spades and then bid diamonds, or the other way around |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there seem to be quite a few kopings in that vicinity|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Harmon Edgar|pg||
nt|harmon: hi all|pg||
mb|2S|an|5!S F1|nt|lml: well done by south and now 7 might be in reach|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure 3@C=minimum is best. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Harmon|pg||
nt|harmon: was gonna be tuff in OR not understanding a word:)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybenot, but at least they seem together on it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: depends how far 2NT is forcing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, that's what counts|pg||
nt|lestergold: however god didnt deal me a solid 9 card suit to defend with!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now will a jump here showm the void|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wilkinsona: well this seems to play well in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes they have bid this beautifully|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 5@S??|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 4@H is easy to make, but 3N looks fine too ... opponents have no suit to set up|pg||
nt|harmon: low heart here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least not at the 4 level|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sommer: NS need points.. get 9 now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but defend he does..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: at least this way shows five spades, which is probably more important |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can make 10 it seems on the "marked" guess in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: cant see this 1n making|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence knows nothing about declarer's hand which makes it very difficult|pg||
nt|golfergolf: No problem now|pg||
nt|lml: perfect ... bravo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done indeed |pg||
nt|Walddk4: indeed, well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: a real example of how to bid this kind of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  he is lucky in the @H distribution and also a bit in the @D and @S them being onside|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|harmon: he read my mind!!!|pg||
nt|harmon: must be illterate:)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I have to concede board 13 to you mike, as the (awful in my opinion) 1 spade overcall was repeated in the other room|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do understand this sequence--and I think I am better foo for that |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant do not |pg||
nt|garnetts: crucial word not |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, the sequence other room looks better judged|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think 2 spades was invite with 5 spades.|pg||
nt|garnetts: yeah they got to a making game-|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..but calling the west hand 17-19 is pushy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: This is a handicap event, and the NS team started with 21 IMP plus|pg||
nt|jbennet: west decided to go for NT. why east didnt bid 3 NT dont know.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Strikes me that 3@S was pointless |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: 1 more for declarer unless defence slip up|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, if playing with the Unlucky Expert, he would win the diamond and play a club, expecting North to be void|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not quite sure how North knew about solid trumps and extra trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: north should ruff second club in case south is void heart|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: Not 4@h for me. S has decided 3n1 after a 2@h bid from N. If interested , S should have bid 3@d for checking the majors. N can have 5-4, 5-5 or 6-4 inmajors|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's the ninth trick |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Marked in clubs also|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: I'm surprised at the @D pitch ... E could still have the @D9 from W's point of view|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: pard (and opps)  probably a bit surprised when a 5/2/6/0 hits the table|pg||
nt|lml: I think the self splinter should show extra trump... it would for me|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: suspect that was a higher diamond played by west first round|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Kind lead though|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: S can now squeezwe W for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, ok. But double is eminently reasonable, and does bring hearts into the picture|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|golfergolf: @C start more problems|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West should probably suspect a singleton spade when North bid 3NT opposite possibly long spades and when partner didn't cover the 10|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: because south has insisted on playing in hearts with nol knoweledge of support and made a slam try as well|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|andyv:  W just didn't want to lead|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|sybarra: yes the early tap,  not much fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thats a claim |pg||
pc|h7|nt|nigel_k:  West can exit safely enough with a heart and if the spade is a singleton, declarer can never set them up|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like he will|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|nigel_k:  There might still have been an endplay on East for the ninth trick though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jillan:  not|pg||
nt|lml: this is a claim now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: bd 3 the other table played and made 6 S |pg||
nt|golfergolf: 6@S on b4 in OR|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, he knows of four-card support - North bid 2@H after 2@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a claim as soon as both defenders followed to first round of truimps|pg||
nt|lml: if hearts were 3-0 there might have been some playing to do|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but whatever, that is a bankable result|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d8|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jbennet: well its worth 17-19. 7 honor cards + some intermediates. 2NT was a lucky move, that should have been rewarded with a making 3 NT.|pg||

nt|rnc: handicap, however based on all the pairs tournaments the player has played...|pg||
nt|rnc: ... A team's hcp is calculated as the average of the players involved in the specific segment. The hcp-average for the two teams is compared and the difference then divided by 10, ...|pg||
nt|rnc: which gives us the number of IMP's per board the 'less skilled' team get as a bonus. As it is a KO-match, even a fraction of an IMP might be important at the end of the match...|pg||

nt|hawe45:  12 tricks even without the @C-finesse, Wests @S are working|pg||

nt|vugraphzwe: Don't know how many|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but thism one not as lucky|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: board 14 played other way up OR, down on the club lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: unless a club lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what to lead....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @s9 or 8 would be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  5@h is safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: can be made with the safety play in spades|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jillan:  yes you need either the @S or the @D to come home, and they both do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Curious to find a Chinese team playing in the Swedish District finals|pg||
nt|henryb:  why? declarer can pick up trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you there a re problesm ahead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this looks frisky|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: can west show his clubs without implyhin he has 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 1H was 4+, 3C shows longer clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is this Steen Moller sitting East?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: No, Christian Möller|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Christia|pg||
nt|golfergolf: n|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all this players are from a district league in two swedish cities, i dont think any of them we would know|pg||
nt|golfergolf: also 6@S on b4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and will|pg||
nt|mdgraham: somehow you feel this is the sort of hand that ought not to be allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: because @SQ first is correct play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, sorry - West has @s9, so it's ok|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is not a safety play, just ordinary techmiwue|pg||
nt|lestergold: if declarer draqws trumps he has a heart loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: a second heart loser i mean|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: I guess I have the wrong nationality as well ...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe East can double for a heart lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: good duck |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Peking duck|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Standard suit combination|pg||
nt|henryb:  technique|pg||
nt|lml: it is the kind of hand that you use to illustrate safety plays... an instructive hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well u can only pick up 4 trumps if they are in south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so easy when there isa 2 way option|pg||
nt|Walddk4: IT's not a safety play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played, it seems|pg||
nt|henryb:  strange play unless "Jack Denies"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can make it now because you can pick up diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|garnetts: Easy lead --but will west try the A@D next |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jillan:  15 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: Yes, if any of @s or @d breaks - 13 tricks|pg||
nt|jillan:  now see if they can bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: W has now denied 5H when not bidding 3H|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a @h lead will sink this|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a matter of technique|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: safety in the sense of playing a spade to the Q first|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: yes thatb saves day|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: 4@D??|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i was expecting 3N after 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E fell in love with his hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will be happy with this result|pg||
nt|lestergold: technically notm a safety play i agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  safety plays (definition) involve conceding a possibly unnecessary trick yo avoid losing too many|pg||
nt|lestergold: however its become rather academic|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Peking team look to be winning this board too..|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ralfwil: and therefore 7nt is better than 7@s|pg||
nt|rnc: It's with mixed feelings I watch (and perhaps comments) this match, since it's my teammates that are playing in the E/W team :), the same team that lost the nail biting finals ...|pg||
nt|rnc: (however under the name of San Sac) with a couple of IMP's after 96 boards the previous year.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 7nt from E with the @d suit|pg||
nt|rnc: For those interesting in the CC of E/W it's available at http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc11/fc_main_en.htm - check under Convention Cards|pg||
nt|chick: knowing all aces+@SK, E only needs to know about the @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E knows W has 5S, 4C and all aces and spade queen are counted for|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or 7@s as well and W can decide the final contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: not sure why west gave up|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: perhaps trying to stay away from NT with a void in pard's suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: weoh dear|pg||
pc|cA|nt|golfergolf: Spell their names in Chinese Characters|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: both teams in this optimistic game|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: I think they just make up the names of teams|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: fell in love - but now close to a divorce :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least he gets the 150 honours|pg||
nt|chick: yikes|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think he was frightened of going off in 3N with 8 top tricks and bound to get another in one of the suits he over valued his hand thats why he went on|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E has to contemplate over his lousy bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: west bid his hand perfectly and if anything had better than he promised|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzwe: 7D was suggestion to play in that suit, so I think W should have bid 7NT|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|garnetts: very tough to get to 6@D after that start |pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: agree magnus 5nt also shows @sQ as E already has denied her|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: thats correct =)|pg||
nt|lestergold: u are absolutely right Henry|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably the night before over cocktails  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|golfergolf: 3NT easyer then 4S|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|h9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: same here Germ |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, just the spade hook, the lead and the diamond position, no probs..|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: east saved a trick not splitting his honours|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: so we see the "technique" work out|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: If the grand slam depends on @sQ (not with W), he can (at least as I play) ask for that card with 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E denied Q of S so 5NT showed the SQ as it's a grand slam try|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well u are not likely to win a match if u fail to bid ur small slams whileoppos are reaching their grands|pg||
nt|lml: declarer probably wishes the spades were 4-0 the other way|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is rather East who, looking at all primes, made no (to me) obvious forward going moves, is to blame|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although you suspect that EW will be a bit nervous about this result|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nigel_k:  It's hard because a double of a freely bid contract is lead directional, but here N/S have been forced to 5@s and East could easily just have a penalty double|pg||
pc|dK|pc|hQ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: except the chinese characters in chat line look like algebra to me|pg||

nt|andyv:  maybe, but with NS not vul, the return isn't very much for a penalty dbl so, in the long run, you are better off making it a lead directing dbl.|pg||
nt|sybarra: so is mine as a math/econ major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing North could do there|pg||
nt|henryb:  also methods where West apparently could not show his two suiter so that East could appreciate the value of the @hJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, not sure of the rights and wrong but that strange Ace was essential, so well done by north|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: he asked and got answer "J from JT9xx"|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed it was, and an excellent play|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he splits declarer ducks of course but makes 11 tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d cold for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5! i meant tov type|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: 3NT in N the only game - but impossible to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: very clever,  thx William |pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland u must be dealing the cards this is the second 20/20 hand this session|pg||
nt|lml: I think once East showed a heart card WEst should have continue on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|golfergolf: Raptor 1NT for S works well|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: top from sequence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book  goes on about "jack denies" |pg||
nt|lestergold: typo Roland 5@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is also cold|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: gosh, 6@s-1 on voard 4|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 suited call coming?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks William, and congrats to North|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwe: and 5D EW|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4s can make on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: guessing 2@C is a transfer raise|pg||
nt|bjacobs: weird stuff|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW can make 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: "lower unbids"|pg||
nt|garnetts: Has to bid 4@S now --surely it is forcing |pg||
mb|4S|nt|jillan:  back to the 4 major street|pg||
nt|lml: East had shown a fit about 17 points and useful controls|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not as sound a contract|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tough here too|pg||
nt|garnetts: case for some sort of two suiter device over 3@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: getting weirder by the minute|pg||
nt|lml: but either player can make a move for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes east was minimum for his strong club and west had such a control rich slammish hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  when did he show useful controls?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Watching cricket; England not too far away from chasing 338|pg||
nt|lml: the heart cuebid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 5@D can be made double dummy, but I don't think I'd be happy playing it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: D on E's hand is not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure how strong 3@D is, but not strong enough for South to bid again|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm with 7@d and enormous playing power i do not like 3@d by N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: Well, I suppose it might make, but probably it will get what it deserves|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he might make for lack of convenient dummy entry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It could, but there are some possible entries.  He might tryr a spade to the queen, and then North pretty much has to give him that entry in one suit or another|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 278-2. Strauss 156*|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, think north has to bid at some stage|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: South must expect North to have quite a good hand |pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: and with a ht lead also,  need to see how he went down |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good bid by East|pg||
nt|lestergold: not sure what the best bid is but io would not make a limit raise|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nice safe contract though|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS is an easy game on NS without a @s lead, but find it? and 5@d on a finess|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not a great hand is it?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: even if onlt to double the final contract|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: poor W can not lead pard's suit |pg||
nt|golfergolf: 4@H in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 H looks easier maybe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good news indeed|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: difficult but maybe a wrong guess by south|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how many overs left, Roland? |pg||
nt|henryb:  really? that was dragged out of him after West made two slam tries and he attempted to sign off in 3N|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: plop|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: 8 overs remain|pg||
nt|lml: he showed a heart control dragged or not.  17 HCP and a heart fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 51 in 8 - well on|pg||
nt|henryb:  and you have 12 HCP and no aces outside trump|pg||
nt|lml: the five level should be safe almost all the time|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have a feeling you are right |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: very frustrating when you have a long suit plus entries and pard cannot lead your suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: Oh well thay can shout at each other when the play is over :) |pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: i think east did not bid 4@d because he was scared of them making 4 vul1s|pg||
nt|lestergold: sapdes|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: E now understands why |pg||
pc|s9|nt|nigel_k:  The E/W hands fit very well and they can also make 11 tricks in diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: blackwood would work|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand even if trumps were behaving |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Its not clear whether 3 spades is forcing, I suspect East thought it was|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|nigel_k:  But it's not obvious who should have bid more|pg||

nt|bjacobs: you're a sadist.  Whilst the contract was dreadful, you can certainly see why East chose it.  West misbid his hand a little, but not by a lot|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So it's been a pretty one-sided match so far|pg||
nt|vbman: 2 red royals poisoned s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: with 6 spades, south perhaps should have gone quietly|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S was bid and amde on board 3 - MACH speeding away|pg||
nt|lestergold: safe paert scores do n ot earn imps when game is on|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is an argument for 5@d bis|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but better than 6 diamonds -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: also poss when you hold this kind iof hand that oppo0se may be able to makem something|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfergolf: 7?|pg||
nt|lestergold: only part scores here again|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: no reason for anyone to bid 6@d only to type it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  1@S dbl|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H a fair game, but..|pg||
nt|lestergold: not today|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a natural 2@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is cold E-W Mike|pg||
nt|henryb:  At mach1 or mach2? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry u are right|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, 7@S is there - but realistically, they will do extremely well to even get to the small slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades cant be attacked|pg||
nt|lml: yes natural playing forcing clubs and it had an amazing preemptive effect on ew|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding it tho unlikely|pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually, not cold, but hard to beat|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: bad diamond break this hand,,|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: any thing wrong with 2 D? |pg||
pc|s4|nt|jillan:  simplifies things|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this is not well judged|pg||
nt|sybarra: other room bid 2 nt |pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: on their way now, but probably only to 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Nice 3@D by east|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what hts stopper he had|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless 3@d is forcing, this looks a good pass|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Is 2@C gf?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 10+ i belive|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: now he has shown 10-12 |pg||
nt|sybarra: junk stayman |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: Nice, but a little disastrous|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I didnt see east hadnt bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|golfergolf: Bye Shirley, Mike and spess, I have to go to another room|pg||
nt|sybarra: danke Germ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Germ. don't forget your passport|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: must be a musunderstanding |pg||
nt|pelu: What did East have for diner - strong vitamin-drinks? |pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: D was for penalties and I can't see why W didn't pass with two aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely west has shown his two suiter and east's douible for busienss why should west remove it with 2 bullets but very poor stuffing in his suits?|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead direction dbl by E|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a children leave the room hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: andmaybe the grannies with weak hearts too|pg||
nt|andyv:  no one likes to follow directions|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Should have bid it louder|pg||
nt|lml: think its cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks ok|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might bring the defence 8 black tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bjacobs: It told North exactly what he needed to know ... partner is void in diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And it looks like they had the GSF mechanism to diagnose the spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: also in sweden I think |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@c 3@d 2@s and a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: weight of cards makes this straightforward|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzwe: Well, if he passed south would have bid 4@D, void|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: if you say so ...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer can set up a ninth trick in hearts but cannot reach all his tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E says "top from QJT..." when Andersson ask|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: duck one club and then win ace and play third round|pg||
nt|henryb:  cold, but takes some good quessing|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has to ruff with Q and take a view|pg||
nt|henryb:  West has to play clubs before any trumps, then ruff with @hQ and run 10|pg||
nt|lml: true west has to guess that north has the @HJ and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: if the defence find the duck etc he wil llikely get that right|pg||
nt|henryb:  he might play one round of trumps first, and then he is down on best defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe 2 @h tricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: ok, bus pass then |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and lots of tricks it seems..|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|henryb:  now no defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: well  all our discussion very academic as usual....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  Declarer should probably play K here because J forcing the ace is not good enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy t find a threaeting defence here|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt need to even run this now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: in which case, full credit (and then some) to the N/S methods|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is defeinitely biddable without the intervention|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: well played south|pg||
nt|andyv:  San Sac has a blitz going on this round|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Sorry declarer can make by ducking this and establishing a spade later|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 11 tricks it seems..|pg||

pc|c7|pc|dJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: death by fire or water take ur choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: diamond finesse losing is good news for South, as it means 3NT is not on|pg||

pc|sA|nt|lml: they got to 6@H is OR on the grand slam hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: I would love to open the N hand |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: On 17, a spec was asking why playing the spades ace was needed, if you glance at the excellent defence in the other room you will see why... the more I look at it the better that ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of spades play seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwe: 2@D 5@D-4+@C or 6+@D, no 4cM|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: toy from East|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes but its not agood 7@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is N permitted ot hit the deck?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or if playing muiderberg,  2 @H =5 hts and 4(+) minor|pg||
nt|golfergolf: I could, 2@H, 5@H, 4+m|pg||
nt|lestergold: even at equal its very dangerous witgh such an awful suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: if had passed South might have bid that |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: No but not 6@h either, because you have to rely on a @s finess after a @c lead. so 5 or 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N N/S 9 tops in spades tyhe 10th trick looked elusive till the elad provided it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  and N buying more collision insurance|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might win this draw trumps and get the good news in clubs when the 10 drops |pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: in 6@H and a @C-lead u could first play @DA and @DQ to discard a @C - so 6@h ned one af the kings onside|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will play Q@c|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  or maybe J@c|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|pelu: so almost 75%|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@h is a with odds slam because ona non club lead its cold and on a club lead you have the option of disposing of the club loser by a guess in 1ds as well as the sapde finesse so ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: id say well more than 505 slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not Dbl on 4@c?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not that it really matters here, but I'm not keen on leading @H2 from 7542|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on their style|pg||

nt|sybarra: over reached |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|vugraphzwe: Because he will be on lead against a heart slam|pg||

pc|hK|nt|pelu: the normalplay will be the ruffing finess in @D - if no King u discard the @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: you would have to take the ruffing finesse of course to preserve the doubole chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: a pitch for a ht |pg||

nt|andyv:  and a push at both tables|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think you can always bid with extra shape and the double just says it is our hand |pg||
nt|vbman: a grand?|pg||
nt|lml: those are the 2 big hands this set so far and they both went Mach's way|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we expected|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder what the auction meant. 2@d is obviously not a transfer, nor is it "forcing Stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 2@d - 2@h followed by 3@c slaminvitational with @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly artificial relay to 2@hA, then 3@c nat fg? |pg||
nt|lestergold: possiblty but let declarer do his own work on this auctiomn|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has shown  a weak hand notm likely to be a suit in north's hand to develop and nprovide discards|pg||
nt|lestergold: opening lead theory does not in my reading on the subject recomments that lead here|pg||

nt|mdgraham: breaks are not kind here|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|wilkinsona: no question..|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a savage layout for e/w as they bid to an unmakeable game somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: the auction might suggest that things arent splitting|pg||
nt|lml: but it is hard to avoid game with 26HCP|pg||
nt|garnetts: when I was much younger I would open the North hand with 3@C |pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: This is  good hand for Lebensohl ... North bids 2NT, then signs off in 3@H over 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the tenth trump is useful |pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 26 counts reach game except in bidding compes|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Last week I wish :)  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last year, you mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: It would have been succesful|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4NT obvious now |pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: absolutely no card wasted|pg||

nt|garnetts: if that means slect a minor |pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: thanks William|pg||
nt|lestergold: excellent book by Us expert Robert Owen on opening leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  you have a bit to handle and perhaps it needs some good breakes - but they are almost all there|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 3S and 4C are cuebids|pg||
nt|mdgraham: something for NS to look at then, missing the diamond fit |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry i am corrected Robert Ewen is the corfrect spelling|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont think 4 spades ir pick a minor|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: And N/S are in tune with that comment|pg||
nt|lestergold: er|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can hardly contain myself--4@S |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I think the double is worse|pg||
nt|garnetts: Must have mixed up his black suits |pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: I think the lead was fine, and the contract was cold regardless of lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vbman: needs a cl singleton from s hand with cards closed|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm east warned west|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ending in something doubled|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: west coudlnt get passed the 5-5 but this will be no fun|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: little point in trying to cash a spade!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  N will not be happy with how the suits split|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: the double of 3@s must suggest penalty surely|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chick: I hope no one thinks their partner has shown the @DA|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that heart lead this is off|pg||
nt|garnetts: even less point in this |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: I wonder what 1@h-2NT-4@C would be. If that is a splinter the South hand would be huge|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: ouch, exactly :(|pg||
nt|jillan:  I think both thinks the other one has...|pg||
nt|chick: This is of course the danger in cuebidding first OR second round controls|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: This is why they invented Blackwood|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vbman: there|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently they already knew club singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 4@c = void|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: good observation Magnus, N could have asked keycards after 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: S says he thinks N had a void in D when he didn't ask for aces|pg||
nt|vbman: but needs 13th trick|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: Haven't seen 4NTx for a while :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: from the fryimng pan.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defended 5NTxx a few years back|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT probably makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyhone knowm what they would lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even on a heart lead it makes. The defence will be thrown in to break a minor|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: well declarer has a pretty good idea about how the cards lie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes....badly|pg||
nt|henryb:  If it is slam invitational with clubs I think North undervalued his hand. The @cQJ become BIG CARDS and outside that he is all prime with controls in all suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: he could have bid 3@d as 4-cards|pg||
nt|henryb:  really!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vbman: thats the 6th trump|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona: cold, but not easy, there is perhaps 11 on the lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: unless error|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|garnetts: why would you bid 4@S ?   Looks like the sort of bid that is aiming to get a mention in a bridge publication|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|lestergold: well that is not the best line....|pg||
nt|lml: if he worked out how the clubs lay which he might have he probably has a shot at 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's not a difficult line, Tony|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: no error|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2NT is four-card support, North could have "lied" about holding the @hQ |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, it's a good bidding test to get to seven|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: do we agree with that way of handling hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Not particularly, but we certainly don't agree with taking the diamond finesse prior to testing the clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That was a genuine blunder|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because if clubs are 3-3, he doesn't need the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: i dont see that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might endplay west of course in trumps|pg||

mb|2C|nt|jillan:  2@S anyone|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I might have to retract that a little bit ... if West pitches a diamond on the club, North does have to guess|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: something|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w will probabbly reach 3N no prayer on a club lead of course but not easy to find from south unless north doubles stayman and he has|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: yes - what else?|pg||
nt|lml: brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: as indeed he should|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: if you had a bid to show both majors, would you use it, or would you just bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 2S is explained as spade and a minor|pg||
nt|jillan:  NOT right |pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  if it is I am crosseyed|pg||

mb|p|nt|vbman: 2h is with a minor?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N still no where  else likely|pg||

pc|c2|nt|pelu: wow - EW in 7@H on board 20 !|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may land in 4 S here |pg||

nt|wilkinsona: do you folk pass with that south hand?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: no - 1@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for the lead, and all that|pg||

pc|d6|nt|lestergold: this resultmay well be replicated of course|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it cant fail|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Innovative contract, but the breaks are poor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West can't really count 13 tricks as partner could have x Kx AKJxxx xxxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  playing specific kings|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even then you need a 4-3 spade break to make 12|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW made the difficult 5 clubs in OR will be disappointed to be -9 on the hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  It is the seventh diamond and third heart that make it good|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, that is why I think E needed to jump to 7 level|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: we can see all cards, so much easier, but a @s lead is ´more attractive for me than a @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  Depends on the phase of the moon, my horrorscope that morning, whether I had a fight with the waiter at breakfast, lots of intangibles|pg||
nt|harmon: lol|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this contract gives the defence a chance|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no double of 1@S?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: 3@h = 10+ @S-bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  another good result for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would have bid 2NT with the E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: or are we replaying this hand?  |pg||
nt|henryb:  NO|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: ..but will doubtless arrive at 3N|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: If S follows through and leads a @H, this will be difficult to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: You have to play on D 3-3 for 1 down|pg||
nt|chick: N has 3 entries and S stops the remaining suit|pg||
nt|jillan:  avoid 4@S here, 3NT seems the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  especially not if this is the way they get to 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: horrible duplication and 3 of west's meagre milton's are as valuable as an icelandic bank|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This might get NBS Lind onto the score card|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I don't have a problem upgrading East, but you know that suits are not breaking and partner has passed so it is quite easy for them to balance|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the 10s, esp. the major suit ones, the hand evaluates to a little better than 15.5 hcp|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So I think it pays for East to be a bit stronger than usual in this situation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be something systemic here - South removing 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, both minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|henryb:  For the record, both N-S pairs play this unusual use of 2@d which I have never seen before|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: at the other table i think they play "sunderlin" not the same as this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: bet he did, if South is there with 2@h|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wilkinsona: ..or not...(I would bid 2clubs-2diamonds?-3N..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Badly enough we doÂ´nt know, what 2 NT shows|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: seem s odd that north is silent with 17 count and south is protecting with a couple of quacks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, light opening, even these days|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: I'll try to publisch some summary of the systems as soon as possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Povl Sommer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|harmon: down to 11|pg||
nt|harmon: or 12 |pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: at the other table 3@h bid showed singelton 3@s 9 cards minors|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if west does not open game is still likely to be bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: NS plays strong @C 14-16NT and neb 1@D|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, true..|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: EW plays natural, 15-17NT, 4cM, 2@C some strong hands or weak @H, 2@D some strong hands or weak w @S, 2M Acol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 'Frissan' is Swedish slang for 'The Hairdresser"|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes magnus, but E will probably play for splitted @c honours|pg||
nt|chick: oops, there goes the plan for -1 :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|golfergolf: 300 it will be|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: I think the team captain is a hairdresser|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: well if this the real auction I am surprised north didn't bid 4@H over 2@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: that diamond duck seems a nec. precaution|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: and this is going to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: That's true|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|chick: -2 is still better than 3@H making though|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Can S really have a club honour after the overcall?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E didn't like that N discarded|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's only hope is Kx @C onside... no joy there|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: the grand slam hand (bid to six here) was played in 4@h next door|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after a 2@H opening|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzwe: went to fast, he made it|pg||
nt|sybarra: that N hand is too good for 2 @H unless you are playing some intermediate 2 |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 21|pg||
nt|vbman: cant recover if he plays a royal|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chick: an overcall on a 10-high suit, too|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ahd to try a @d|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|wilkinsona: accurate defence..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a handicap tournament, so the 22 IMPs Frissan got because they are ranked lower than Peking|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|vugraphzwe: singelton @h,3@s and 9 cards in minors|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ,,or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is all they get for the entire match|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|pg||

nt|harmon: thats makes auction easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: indeed|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h3|pc|s5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he had no choice but to play pard for Q or it would have cost not to try it|pg||

nt|vugraphzwe: Some scoring issues|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: anyway your prediction worked out right after all, Mike|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: NS did not discuss anything about the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: was not a difficuolt prediction to make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi David, just as well you missed that|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looked like an odd contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thanks to William, our wonderful operator,  Job well done |pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzwe: my pleasure|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: can you imagine comparison?  +400,  "we passed it out" |pg||
nt|garnetts: I prefer 1@H to 2@C |pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzwe: my pleasure :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 22 flat, it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm north  alittlemore optimistic than open room counterpart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "What did they go eight off in?"|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks normal to reach layout unfrioendly|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe difficult in opps "suit":)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north has opened an artificial suit in then game which e/wcan make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: 6@C is quite a good contract - basically, you just need to organize two heart ruffs, and it's doable|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|lestergold: and they arebn notm even in the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: funny game bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfergolf: Nice to be with yoy, my first time on comment|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess this is how South runs with a one suited hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  Also, thank yous to SBF's Ostra Nellansvenka District and Carl Ragnarsson for putting this venue up for us.|pg||
nt|sommer: guess, if 2NT from E wouldnt be minors...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now west must find that @d switch to beat this|pg||

nt|vugraphzwe: once again, my pleasure, hope to see you all later.|pg||
nt|lestergold: pne of those hands tho where defence needs to play very carefully|pg||
nt|lml: its going to be close|pg||
nt|garnetts: I might even make this |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes well I have always doubled, but I know I am in a minority these days|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: You're on the way Germ!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They rather seem to be on THEIR way as well (N/S)|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead may let this thru|pg||
nt|lml: the spot cards are kind of working for south|pg||
nt|henryb:  And here I was thinking that it should be unnecessary to reach 3N with a misfitting combined 24 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/wnot vul|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: should be, and should have been..|pg||
nt|garnetts: I see intending to use equal conversion over the likely spade response |pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: declarferf can make 2@s 4 @hs 2 @d and a club|pg||

nt|sybarra: scheduled time is 5:55 am Los Angeles, 8:55 am New York, 14.55 Paris, 1:55 pm London|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: with 6 and 5 card suits about and fair inermediates i think 3n is normal|pg||
nt|lml: the @C9 and S!9 were big cards|pg||
nt|lml: thats why they bid it|pg||
nt|lml: @S9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: next set due to start shortly|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are definitely making it and another good one for Mach|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so team Mach win, congrats to them|pg||

nt|sommer: I would dare 2NT, I guess|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: looks like 2nt asked second suit, as it would in forcing stayman|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So win the club and play a heart, win the club continuation, and you can easily ruff two hearts high, using @DK and @SA as entries for the last heart ruff and to draw the last ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Yes, that's true, they have given up the game-try and instead they try to make it easier to bid to the best game/slam|pg||
