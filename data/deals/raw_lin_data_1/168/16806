nt|daman: can you imagine    EW were not in the auction at all in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes i can, unlike French players to overcall with the E hand|pg||
nt|ady: not everyone overcalls 2@C with east hand   so then e/w wont be in contention|pg||

nt|jlall: my impression of romanians is that they are very aggressive though so I am surprised by that evaluation|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|hedyg: have never seen 4000, is that possible at all?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: 6D and 6H both make, 6H being a bit better because you might make with 3-2 trumps if the CA is off (and you rightside it, or they don't lead a club)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I would expect most table to end at 4@H only, but 6@H obviously is a very good score|pg||
nt|jlall: but very tough to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: i agree|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jlall: jeremy do you like 2@H or would you jump?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|jjbrr:  i like to go low on this type of auction and bid 2@H only|pg||
nt|jlall: i confess id be tempted :)|pg||
nt|jlall: the void is very nice, but having no aces is bad|pg||
nt|jlall: assuming 4D shows strong diamonds, east still has a problem because he doesn't know which shortness west has...if it is short clubs he can basically claim slam, short spades and he ...|pg||
nt|jlall: has some issues...i expect him to move though|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  the dbl by S makes E unhappy, because AQxx of @S looks less exciting... but W gets very excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe with a 4@S cue hoping to get a club cue from partner, or maybe he will be less scientific hoping to not give away the lead|pg||
nt|jlall: still after the double if you're off cashing clubs probably south has them both so I would not be attempting trickery here :)|pg||
nt|jlall: and of course you could be off the first THREE clubs on a bad day, though that seems pessimistic|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jlall: come on Rosu, 4@S :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|jlall: west admits to his club control|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  looks like theyre off to the races|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jlall: east will bid at least 5@D here|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: yes i once conceded such a score 7@HXX = IN ONE ROOM AND 7@SX Iin the other both making on a ruff and discard at trick 1 in each room|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|jlall: west concerned still by his lack of aces, doesn't like the void after 4@S, and has no @HK either|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  in my style i would cuebid 4@C first to show first or second round control; 5@C after 4@S would show first round control|pg||
nt|jlall: east concerned about bad trumps with the likely bad split...|pg||
nt|jlall: still might stop here|pg||
nt|jlall: i will boldly predict a pass from east :) maybe he shouldn't with the AK of trumps though|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jlall: the jack of trumps is so huge here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jlall: so is the jack of diamodns to a lesser degree...maybe west should have done more with both of those|pg||
nt|jlall: what do you think jeremy?|pg||
nt|jlall: reasonable? or who should have bid more?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jjbrr:  i really want to assign the blame to west, but i really think they both made reasonable actions.|pg||
nt|jlall: yes i think its west also|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jjbrr:  4@D is such a space-consuming bid|pg||

pc|h4|pg||

nt|jlall: the thing is, once youre in 5, 6 is much better, because if the CA is off 5 might well go down|pg||

nt|mamos: what is 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: F1|pg||
nt|mamos: forcing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like "forcing"|pg||
nt|toobad: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play fcg nt,  E doesnt even have his "thinking"|pg||
nt|toobad: playing 5c majors FNT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: so if this shows 6 Spades  worth 3@S|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|toobad: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: if truly plaing fcg NT  W has to hit the deck to 3 clubs|pg||
nt|toobad: he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: East has messed up here I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: E hand should be something like  x, xxxx, x, qjxxxxx|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: or x, xxx, xxx, kqxxxx |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|toobad: N wont be able to visualise E hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: how could you on that bidding?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mamos: still  only 140 in the OR so no great harm done |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|toobad: none at all |pg||

nt|Vugraphzyf: Thanks All :)|pg||
nt|daman: thx everyone|pg||
nt|jlall: 4C obviously is short clubs, is 3S obviously short spades? it should be but you need the agreement|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  if 3@C was a pattern bid, might that have worked better, in general?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iq007:  inspired double for Popescu to reach 4@h on the previous board|pg||
nt|jlall: it wouldnt have really helped though, east would have been quite turned off by short spades, i was liking their auction until the 5H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|iq007:  they really need some VPs as they are the last team in the group|pg||
nt|iq007:  the last two teams from each series go to B league|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: great slam here i dont think|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm 9@s 2nd entry to N |pg||
mb|3C|nt|iq007:  and the first 2 from each series advance in the semi-finals|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jlall: bidding 4S is quite strong but typical these days|pg||
mb|d|nt|jlall: south will catch a raise of spades and just punt out game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|hedyg: hard to find the @H lead|pg||
nt|jlall: or not!|pg||
nt|jlall: i find norths pass strange, do you disagree?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: A@S|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I admit I woul bid 2@S after the dbl|pg||
nt|jlall: those jacks are pretty bad but its still 7 points, 3 spades, a ruffing value, white/red...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|jlall: hah, even the delayed raise does it...I think east pushed them there though|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be automatic|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  well. they've made the last guess, which has some merit in competitive auctions.|pg||
nt|jlall: I am not sure why east bid 4@D either|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: yes, and i also think that supp part in @s is holy:)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  and in this case does quite well.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: if you dont play the A@S you never know what is going on|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jlall: when RHO bids 4@D you just bid 4@S since it might be a save if 4@D makes, and who knows you might make... if RHO passes it's different, he still might have bid though expecting ...|pg||
nt|jlall: partner to have 2 spades and some values, likelyy in clubs given the auction|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  note the other table did quite well with the NS cards also; not sure why EW were so timid. Is 5m very expensive insurance?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|hedyg: Quantin played A@S after J@C ducked|pg||
pc|h5|nt|iq007:  What are your choices here? K lead or small @c?|pg||
nt|iq007:  If the K is lead you are subject to a bath coup (declearer will play small to remain in control)|pg||
nt|iq007:  small-big is 2-0 until now :)|pg||
nt|iq007:  it depends also on what signals have you discussed with your partner, I prefer to give attitude on Q lead and count on K lead|pg||
nt|zensuni: 2@c by Chelu doesn't make @c lead too appealing though|pg||
nt|rocketer: K@C|pg||
nt|iq007:  So from KQ I can lead both K or Q, Q from something like KQx and K from strong holdings which asks unblock, then count|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|zensuni: K definetely looks better if @C lead, or rusinow Q|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|rocketer: 3NT=|pg||
nt|iq007:  7 is a count signal|pg||
nt|jlall: red/white it is quite expensive yes|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@S? really?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Hervé?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: he created an extra loser?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzyf: he played @S9|pg||
nt|jlall: down 3 if you don't get hearts right|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|rocketer: look's like +1 now :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|zensuni: :)|pg||

nt|iq007:  right|pg||
nt|iq007:  do you know which is the final score here?|pg||
nt|iq007:  it seems we are missing some boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: just a sec, i ll check with the other vu op|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: ok, this is the final score, but it seems that some boards are not shown|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: in the open|pg||
