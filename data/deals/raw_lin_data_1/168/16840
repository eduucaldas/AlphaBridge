nt|Walddk2: Close to a grand slam for a start|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: been in worse grands |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|idc: A bidding challenge for N-S - even getting to 6@d will require effort|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is a good start|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now no one can stop Kerri Nash|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: 3@s is a good start - North has lots of controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Mind you, North's 1@d opening will help things along - a different suit would have made it tougher|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|yorkbeach:  must be cue bidding 1st round controls before 2nd|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  what happened over 5@c - how did South know to go on to 6@d?|pg||
nt|idc: A little surprised by North's 5@d, perhaps it was 5@h?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nash will be relieved to see @DK offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzwp: no it was 5D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s3|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because Connolly failed to bid 4@H|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|idc: I should have known better than to think our operator, Christine, would have made a mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goes to show that Italian (mixed) cue bids are superior|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
mc|12|nt|yorkbeach:  I thought I was the last person to adopt them - and that was about 15 years ago|pg||

nt|toobad: after 3d a 3h bid would gather a 3s cue and then i think 6h is a good punt, but they knew it was on a hook at best|pg||
nt|sybarra: unless someone just blasts into it |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card does say 1st discard is suit preference|pg||
nt|jtr: Was very tough|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better to have a defensive misunderstanding when only an overtrick is at stake|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 3NT|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: obviously no heart lead in open|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you would guess East led clubs and the defence continued them when in with @DA|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: cards lie very well for EW  here|pg||
nt|toobad: H contract EW and D NS .... competitive auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem qith 4@c bid it could be interpreted as cue bid agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|stewball: good lord\|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: for jrs. (always optimistic)  remarkable patience |pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: i stick to my view that north with his great hand but poor spade suit wants to go slowly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@h best here|pg||
nt|sybarra: next level for S might have been 5 |pg||
nt|stewball: i dont disagree but 4@c was obvious for me|pg||
nt|stewball: 3@s a little wet.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they seem to be dealing slams here like confetti|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I wonder what 3@C is |pg||
nt|toobad: off on a H lead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|toobad: i agree|pg||
nt|jtr: 6 is a very lucky make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i will be surprised if this is let thru|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i spoke before i saw the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: well done in both rooms|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we know already what happened in the other room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ugh again |pg||
nt|stewball: this south doesnt like 7 card suits:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is another serious lost opportunity and an expensive one|pg||
nt|stewball: must be a personal rule|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: after 4 @S  I am afraid I would have blasted 6 @D  (dont mean to be "resulting"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jtr: On this yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: and4N isnt even making thats the doubole whammy of it|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: do we have any comments re 4th best from qj8x? |pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: yes and if i were non playing capt i mighty vbe blasting these two out for a session or so|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: with the double the lead from tghe major was even more likely to gain|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: it didnt work out well!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not good, with 5@D icy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|toobad: reasonable shot|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: Not so sure about this play|pg||
nt|galadriel: England off to a cracking start in both competitions|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean in open room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: but Q or J would have had same success|pg||
nt|sybarra: not resulting, but I am not a leader of low from that holding |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
mc|7|nt|mamos: or lack of it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well lucky the imp scale accomodates this result just about|pg||

nt|idc: Well, however they got there it was a good board for the Irish|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, 6@d making is a pretty solid start|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Nothing happens overnight in Britain|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|idc: We should be getting scores from the other table about 15 mins after we play the hand here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  West has done well not to invite game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s and two aces to lose|pg||

nt|sybarra: one of those hands |pg||
nt|toobad: indeed ........... a C would have fared no better|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a shapely deal|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one good 3N missed and one bad one bid by n/s so not a great start|pg||
nt|toobad: 3c was presumably some sort of minor try so 3N a surprising choice of contract|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: pass......yikes|pg||
nt|mamos: seems a little odd not to be able to introduce such a good suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: may come back around to you at 4 @S |pg||
nt|toobad: really a pass?|pg||
nt|toobad: Kerri is getting shy with old age|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  1@d may be only three but it will be more than that most of the time|pg||
nt|toobad: 4s for EW|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mamos: I think I'd bid 4@h  shows where i live|pg||
nt|sybarra: ladies!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: you scare me |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would bid 4 @H over any bid |pg||
nt|toobad: i'll be getting the whip out!!|pg||
nt|jtr: Identical auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  identical auction to other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  and almost identical comments :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't want to be unkind, but doubling 2@h with that North hand is simply verbal diarrhoea  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n a lot better|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: what on earfth is this 3@h bid about?|pg||
nt|sybarra: optimism |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: hoping that partner miscounted his points and should have opened 2n?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: bonkers is nt it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: pard opened and I hold that great  card suit? |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am bidding  (and I am NOT a jr)|pg||
nt|toobad: vvvv unlike Kerri!!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: the double i mean|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: or a cow flew by |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has ducked to avoid crashing honours and so that South can lead a trump|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|jtr: If he crosses to a @d they might play another if he misguesses the @hs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: and as a few bermuda bowls winners would tell them... partner never has...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|idc: They play so quickly, spectators don't have to put up with very much from the commentators |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that may not be such a disadvantage|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: quite a common method here is to play 2@d=any game force|pg||
nt|idc: East close to going on I guess|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have done well again to stop low|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer should be able to restrict @d losers to one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opposite a (presumably) weak NT the East hand is one of those awkward in-between hands |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  throw on the fourth @c and another on a @h|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes EW are playing a 15-17 1NT opening, so West's sequenec shows less than that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is probably going to take the winning view in trumps|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  can cater for any 4@s with North|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  also South would have opened with @cA-K @sQ and @dK|pg||

nt|sybarra: (cow flew by is expression used for not being "at the table")|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT and 4@s should both be making|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I apologise. I thought the contract was 4@s|pg||
nt|toobad: be lucky ..........|pg||
nt|lestergold: well after opps have missed two cold slams you dont want to be optimistic just sit tight|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: godness knos what 2@c meant at other table but it scored what it deserved|pg||
mb|1C|nt|toobad: 6c here if no S lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: not a good 6@c tho|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: 6N or 61c by north cant be touched as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sybarra: A Hugh Kesley expression - it's chapter title in one of his books!  (thx spec,  I knew I didnt make it up)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: whoever bids 3N first seems the order of the day|pg||
nt|lestergold: however this is the normal spot|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  my auction would have 3@s from South and 3NT from North|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: coffee|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, North could have a single @c|pg||
nt|stewball: looks like east is inviting by relay|pg||
nt|lestergold: but sanity has returned to west|pg||
nt|sybarra: either the beer or the tea kicking in maybe|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  or six spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: we can get coffee and n/s will be disappointed with result |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: one problem with these hands is that if 3@C is forcing South can't really tell whether North has 6-7 useful hcp or a poorer hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|h5|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  !jK offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 17 imps on board 13! - 4N-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|idc: E-W seem to have 4 losers, so a fragile 3NT is going to do better than the more normal 4@s|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|chilloncan: if NS have a defensive missunderstanding E might make 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|idc: well, may do better I should say - defence can prevail|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yorkbeach:  if South cashes 2 top @c the @hK does not make|pg||
nt|idc: I suppose with @dT9 coming down, 4@s could make if South sets up East's @cQ for a @h pitch|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  can South avoid the dilemma?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chilloncan: discouraging club is easy, but S might shift to a heart|pg||
nt|idc: Both a @s or a @d switch may look potantially dangerous on that dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|chilloncan: though if club king is ambiuguous we may have poster child for Journalist leads|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|idc: A good hand for getting an attitude signal from partner rather than count|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they are playing reverse count|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: so South has a bit of a blind guess here|pg||

nt|lestergold: game on a finesse happens to be wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit unlucky|pg||

nt|sybarra: I play fcg nt,  E doesnt even have his "thinking"|pg||
nt|toobad: playing 5c majors FNT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: so if this shows 6 Spades  worth 3@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we all prefer double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Just|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh i may have spoke too soon|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well :) there's quite a bit on this one|pg||
nt|toobad: this should be fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: if theirm partnership style allows south to double with his pile of mgrabage then north should not float it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: East has messed up here I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I predict the p[layers will be consulting the back of the 2@d bidding card if this makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: E hand should be something like  x, xxxx, x, qjxxxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: yes for me|pg||

pc|cA|nt|sybarra: or x, xxx, xxx, kqxxxx |pg||

nt|stewball:  if S cashes @c AK....|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|yorkbeach:  West will be hoping NS diamonds are 2-2|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm told NS were recently part of the team that won the Tollemache last weekend|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|galadriel: Maybe only North|pg||

nt|stewball: bingo|pg||

nt|stewball: carding problem for \NS|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: how could you on that bidding?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: still  only 140 in the OR so no great harm done |pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  yes that is right the North East won the Tolle|pg||

nt|toobad: none at all |pg||

mb|3S|nt|lestergold: anything else|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: 3NT looks makeable|pg||

nt|lestergold: this is feeble|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stewball: ,,dont care for S's evaluation,,maybe easier if N bid @hs|pg||
nt|stewball: but S has a huge hand on this auction|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yorkbeach:  not convinced this is the moment for the Moysian|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surely 2NT would show a hand too weak to open 1NT on EW system|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s seems silly|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: 2@S is slightly silly...if strong NT 2NT has to be allowed to be this...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jbgood: clubs behave, so just a matter of overtrick|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it can cause partner a momentary irritation|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suspect North will upgrade to 1NT if three passes come|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: Just 24 between N-S here but what a difference all the Ts & 9s make|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, the danger is that it will cause partner a much longer than momentary problem on a future hand where it matters|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  BANZAI values the tens highly|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: i would open the N hand 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: A lot to be said for that, upgrading it to 15|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chilloncan: apart from the general upgradability, N has a hand that is likely to gain from being declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North will be hoping the black queens are not where they are|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it is a strange hand - North would probably open 1NT whether it is 15-17 or 12-14|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in my view S was close to a 2N bid, with his great intermediates, useful shape, and a contribution in all suits, esp D knave|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|chilloncan: but it is N who has the clearer upgrade|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dA|mc|9|nt|mdgraham: Binkie Points can get complicated because fractions are involved |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Banzai avoids the fractions|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: 12 tricks is alot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: close 3n avaialble here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  a very good result for the English EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might be right Mike, but some times you bid and somedays its right|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  I would have doubled as South|pg||
nt|toobad: another 3N from NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: with n/s the intermnediates make 3n a fair contract|pg||
nt|stewball: well the good thing about being junior is that they have lots of time to get better|pg||
nt|lestergold: norh has a very good 14 worth an upgrade?|pg||
nt|stewball: and these hands have been pretty instructive for them|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: 31 combined only 10 tricks available tho|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|mamos: im sure thats true its what you do  but perhaps you shouldnt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  less certainty that 2@h is six |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  more sensible contract than the other room|pg||
pc|s8|nt|galadriel: Ha! No danger of 12 here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with clubs 2-2, 4@s doubled is down only one|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|toobad: 4S is very frisky bidding|pg||

nt|toobad: oops|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bessi2: 5@d is the best spot but nearly impossible to bid|pg||
nt|nicksan: And they may well double their lead here. Not sure where the 10th trick came from in CR|pg||
nt|lestergold: just total overbidding|pg||
nt|toobad: nees jc lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suppose north was worth a quantitative try on thier methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: but no more|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a lot of chances for this one|pg||
pc|c8|nt|galadriel: agreed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even @cAx in East not enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky spades 3/3 for the tenth trick!|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand a good exmaple of how unreliable point count is when hands are so duplicated|pg||
nt|toobad: nice safe lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: poor old NS can't be enjoying this|pg||
nt|lestergold: their misery counterbalanced no doubt by e/w pleasure|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think N/S will learn from this session the value of bidding the long suits |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  will repeated trump leads leave declarer with four diamonds to lose?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not going to find out now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I regret that I know what it's like when things go wrong on Vugraph - not a particularly pleasant experience|pg||
nt|lestergold: however nising this game is not as bad as the other contracts they have missed|pg||
nt|stewball: and supporting p with 7 cards:)|pg||

nt|galadriel: A club would seem natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's bid is typical action of one of my late night gamblers|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yorkbeach:  needs to cash the @dA to beat it|pg||
nt|lestergold: that was a hanging drawering and quartering bridge crime|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  could be carnage here|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes on 17 North doubled presumbly intending it as a game try - no idea why South declined|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I do not envy South here|pg||
nt|vugraphzwp: she is deep in thought!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I usually decline to play that pass forces a redouble|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but works on deals like this|pg||
nt|idc: Hey, non-vul - just choose a 3 card suit & bid it confidently|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a bit late for that|pg||
nt|idc: my theory is that you give opps maximum rounds of bidding to pull|pg||
nt|idc: so start with 2@c, then redbl a dbl asking partner to pull|pg||
nt|chilloncan: at these colours the double by N is not really as attractive facing a passed partner. pass rates to break even at worst with chances of better  -- unless of course S has 5+ spades. ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: then there may be a game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would bid a quick 2@h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  opponents always more wary of doubling into game|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  see what I mean - East wants to double but is unsure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South should pull really - the only time that is wrong is when partne has seven or more tricks in his own hand, but if that is the case you will lose 100 or so - no big deal   |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: well he isnt helping the cause by huddling....that takes the vig out of an eventual double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as against the 760/1160 or more than you could concede|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@h seems very optimistic|pg||
nt|idc: slightly surprised that West didn't dbl 2@h - now perhaps East thinks they have little wasted there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, on one case I remember, 1960|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  the short @s10 is bad news for declarer|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is being very ethical I guess|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|yorkbeach:  placing South with good hearts - same as if South bid 2@h confidently |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  mind you after South discorages at trick one, North can reasonably switch|pg||
nt|idc: @d switch no good now I think, since it gives declarer a 9th trick|pg||
nt|idc: has to be a top @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and teh bidding marks South with zilch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North can count South for a 0-count|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is strange that W did not double 2H as he has well above average defense against it and a great lead.  as for 3H, once E rejects a double -- and i have no idea why he did since ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: opps are in a jknown 43 fit with little strength -- then i think he IS right to commit to game. but double is so much simpler|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East knows all the finesses are wrong - so game is uncertain|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  NS lost 300 in 2@s doubled at the other table|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|idc: North had option of low spade, playing South for Tx, but not consistent with bidding|pg||

pc|d5|nt|toobad: home now |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a criss-cross raise?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|toobad: good switch|pg||
nt|mamos: from the fact that West bid 3NT  I suspect 2@d showed a better hand than East really had|pg||
nt|toobad: entry problems now to set up 2nd spade|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  system cad says weak jump shifts at the two level|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|toobad: it has happened to us all at some sort ofv level|pg||

nt|jtr: I think only South needs to:)|pg||

nt|chilloncan: i would overcall 2H with E hand, others wouldnt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  huge misunderstaing in the other room it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  much prefer 6@c to 4@s|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: difficult for South after 3@D  - not unreasonable to give preference |pg||
mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  and 4@s was on an uncontested auction|pg||
nt|chilloncan: big bid by S will get rewarded|pg||
nt|idc: Last board this match, so time to give thanks:|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N cant do less than 6H|pg||
nt|idc: To our Vugraph Operator Christine Walker, BGB representative Sandra Claridge,|pg||

nt|mdgraham: last match of he event due in about half-an-hour|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chilloncan: really N has enough to explore for a grand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Axxxxxx and heart ace make it good|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Hx only three down - but the board was lost at the other table |pg||

pc|cK|mc|12|nt|idc: Have to say this was a keck of a session by N.I. team - if they'd played like that all weekend they'd be challenging England|pg||
nt|idc: keck?  heck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done NI - comprehensive win|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  16:45 next match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Hx four down on best defence, but that would be only a pyrrhic victory |pg||

nt|mamos: I'm a 1@h man|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @H will make |pg||
nt|galadriel: Yes, it's becoming unusual|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello people Hello  4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good slam 31 HCP good controls and a good trump suit should make it possible to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome David|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks|pg||
nt|toobad: 3N par here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it does look like 3N had good chances there|pg||
nt|lestergold: a more interesting hand...|pg||
nt|stewball: action coming here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @C doesnt look bad |pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Evening David :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: (not saying it is necessarily great spot) |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Not so eay now|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Anne|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT from South will catch a big raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: all a question of whether n/s find tghe cold club slam|pg||
nt|stewball: 6 looks even better:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos: though wont make much difference here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @H person, since hand not strong enough for true reverse|pg||
nt|mamos: If you open 1@d it sometimes gets hard to show Hearts|pg||
nt|toobad: Jacoby is a good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Tricky for North to bid 2NT over the Multi with no spade stopper|pg||
nt|jtr: East might have bid more but were fearful of partner having a strong option|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: South a little light for 2NT perhaps...|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|stewball: 4@c-6@c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: now.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: I know north wants to force to game which in a misfit isnt necessarily on but 2@d leaves more space|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: Hauge seem to have recovered after 2 losses and make a challenge if Gillis lose by let us say 11-19.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hard to see this ending up in anything other than 4 @H, making, or possibly 3 NT|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@c shows shortage|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C shortness I assume |pg||
nt|mamos: they may bid this now|pg||
nt|toobad: 6 now or Blackwood?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what now? |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: No nonsense!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  nice to have one of my predictions come true :)|pg||
nt|toobad: 4 h more likely|pg||
mb|4S|nt|toobad: no hurry, quite rightly|pg||
nt|sybarra: the delicate approach |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  standard play in diamonds - top from North first|pg||
nt|lestergold: very good 5 @d tricks always likely 2 top spades  and a likely trick in clubs or hearts etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: i think someone will just bid it soon though|pg||
nt|stewball: ugh|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i mean 2 tricksm out od clubs and nhearts one way or the other likkely|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: serious 3 nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that is the problem can south do mnore than give forced preference to spades|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bessi2: i wonder what 3@h means|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the cue bids go on |pg||
pc|h8|nt|nicksan: I wonder if a trump lead from South could break it? This, however, won't do it.|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 2 @c was @ds, perhaps W just showed his distribution?|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lay it could not fail|pg||
nt|sybarra: double ugh|pg||
nt|lestergold: over 2@d south would bid 3@c expecting north to pass but north has a raise to 4@c and then...|pg||
nt|stewball: i dont know why S cant bid his hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bessi2: i think a trump beats it Nick|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the last board of this weekend, and some thanks are due.  Thank you operator operator Hrafnhildur, for your tireless efforts during these days. Well done indeed! And thanks ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: to sponsor Iceland Express and Bridgesamband Íslands (Ólöf),  for making it possible for us to watch the this exciting bridge live.  And of course thanks to BBO and Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|nicksan: yes, think so. E/W getting rewarded here for not mentioning the Clubs in the bidding|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|stewball: his hand is @cs|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: its the shape of W hand that has not been made clear to E|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: because north took his space away|pg||
nt|stewball: well thats no reason imo|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@c can go horribly wrong for example if north'sclub and heart holdings are switched where are they going?|pg||
nt|stewball: if @s is right N can bid 4@s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: Also thank you Nick Sandqvist (who has been here all the time) and all the other commentators who have provided us with expert opinions and analyses. |pg||
nt|nicksan: Thanks Jon, and yourself of course (as well as all the others)|pg||
nt|jbgood: Last, but not least, a big thank you to the audience, your inputs are always appreciated.|pg||
nt|toobad: oops|pg||
nt|mamos: two key cards missing|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam needs the k of @H on side or dropping |pg||
nt|toobad: clearly v steady players. a reasonable auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Keri (N) thinking she has 2 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|toobad: i've just been told that W played for Scotland in the Europeans last year|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yorkbeach:  Stopping the overtrick will require West to keep all the clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: when north bids 2@d and south passes games are not often missed|pg||
nt|sybarra: what has happened to 2 @C , 3 @C bid?|pg||
nt|stewball: they may play that g/f|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: and a lot of pairs would be  in it |pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jtr: No so easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: not enufn points for 2 level response|pg||
mc|9|nt|jtr: Not|pg||
nt|toobad: +1 on S return |pg||
nt|sybarra: and same here so sort of stuck|pg||
