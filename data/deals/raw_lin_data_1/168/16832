nt|kiwibridge: yes DD 6@H is the spot|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psridhar: if he plays for N to hold both minors and tries squeeze throw in , he wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for either @d finesse or @c to be 3-3 he may fail|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thinking hard obviously|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 1D lead from N would help|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|psridhar: this 6nt is not a long-suit slam, so N will be passive in his lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|psridhar: when they bid slam on long suits it is often a 'tempo' game, so u make attacking leads|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: that is a no play slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: the contract is really 6C|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not surprised-W suggested 6C enroute to 6N ...and E imagined his pd has a 5 bagger-lack of unnderstdg|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, hoped the original @C wasn't short, alas it was|pg||

nt|mwigor: it took until the first action on the first board for the two tables to diverge|pg||
nt|mwigor: in the other room milne opened the north hand 1@s which will lead to a very different auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: hi bob|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: both pairs play precision here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: agressive 3@H or just 2@H|pg||

nt|bobholl: @S now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mwigor: they can run to 5@c but that is also down 2|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think he's got to give up on @S 42 with Q dropping|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|tejjyid: except East may have woken up to the @C fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doesn't :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: E-W are best female players in Taiwan|pg||

nt|tejjyid: but we dontmind|pg||
nt|noodle:  i can change the flag :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: this isthe final of  aust most prestigeous event|pg||
nt|gambit: I love to quote from Edgar Kaplan's archive, forgive me and smile|pg||
nt|bobholl: but just a little :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry |pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps trying @S and @H first she'll see that a @C/@D squeeze only possibility assuming N had @DQ on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  yes and milne mounted a great come back yesterday that kept me up till 4 am :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 2nd set of 4 16-board segments|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HI Shirley|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mwigor: this hand may well be opened 1NT in both rooms (but i think) its a strong NT in this room and a weak NT in the other room|pg||
nt|frankaus: The Bloom crew is staffed by hardened proffesionals - |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: E-W also plays precision|pg||
nt|suketbombi: very agressive 3@D there|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 6@C but not easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  seems ok to upgrade a good 14; as we have seen  opening bids are very agressive nowadays|pg||
nt|panja: good|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 3/low lead for N-S|pg||
nt|bobholl: despite the vulnaribilty not afraid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: is it true?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: yes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: both teams are playing 5-handed|pg||
nt|gambit: one @S or dble, close|pg||
nt|sybarra2: go for it!!  great fun Edgar|pg||
nt|sybarra2: you hate to miss 6 @D |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H splinter noww may be|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: X presume single/suited|pg||
nt|frankaus: Milne crew the next generation of excellence - have been at the top of many international junior events|pg||
nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for East|pg||
nt|suketbombi: finds a great fit;)|pg||
nt|bobholl: patrick now has a nasty guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: That wud be music to North's ears...|pg||
nt|bobholl: patrick thinking about 3@H ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gambit: E let S off the hook|pg||
nt|gambit: will N bid spades next. yes if at an economical level |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra2: likely n/s still find 2 sp or so |pg||
nt|bobholl: @C being a minor makes it difficult to reach them|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think he is worth\more than 4@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: alas |pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps 2@C has multiple meanings?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: maybe he wants to see if opp bids hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: no , nat , f1|pg||
nt|bobholl: if only F 1 round 3@C understandable|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - not easy now to justify his hand|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: this table is same set of players as Q1 -- just flipping NS & EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: "Somebody said down one is good bridge, perhaps making is better." EK|pg||
nt|gambit: nice lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables were not linked, so the closed room operator shut down in order to reconnect. Back now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He will insert result on board 1 in MOVIE soon|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok  did we get names sorted out?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: no|pg||
nt|Walddk4: must wait till next segment|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this could get messy |pg||
nt|sybarra2: we can do that |pg||
nt|bobholl: not any more |pg||
nt|suketbombi: this is a tuff one|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @D lead 5@S won't make|pg||
mb|5S|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hiya ed|pg||
nt|tejjyid: That was very straightforward|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi specs, co commentators and the best, vug operator|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops --- Michael Whibley has replaced Liam Milne|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Al; hi, Raija and specs.|pg||
nt|sharkey: May just gamble now and land in slam - perhaps lucky|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done think 3@C showed extra's too |pg||
mb|6C|nt|tejjyid: who needs 8 trumps,anayway?|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  well it is a great spot  wd|pg||
nt|mwigor: with everything so friendly 11 tricks are possible|pg||
nt|mwigor: but declarer will be more concerned with maximising his chance of 10|pg||
nt|frankaus: my suits never break this faviorable :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  if they did franj you d be playing not commenting :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of those young ex-pat Kiwis look alike to me|pg||
nt|panja: well..it should be possible to handle Clubs..|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudn't you have to show @C support?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: hi all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Raija and Al:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrmal to upgrade 14's with good 5 card suits to 15-17 these days, although EW may play 14-16|pg||
nt|bobholl: its for free after the double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Gong is thinking now|pg||
nt|sharkey: S wud bid the same with one less @S and one more @H?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|bobholl: 6@H going for 800 only :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: signaling ofr a @C|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes it s a great method to signal suit preference when following suit in a known long suit (like a preempt)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: will double finesse in @S so 3 just made|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: he shoudl win @CJ and run @DJ..|pg||
nt|suketbombi: patrick has been there before knows his Customers I guess will be happy with 500 1@S 1@H 2@DS & a @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: the trouble with precision is losing your eventual @D fit |pg||
nt|sharkey: Nice evaluation by the ladies|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be 1100 if @HJ comes in on 3 @D rounds|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|bobholl: guess he won't do that :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sharkey: North probably denied stiff @S so shud get 1100 I think|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|bobholl: they haven't got 2@D if they lead them now |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bobholl: did'nt want to risk his contract wise decision|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1100 gone|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|panja: well..now @DAJ and back for a ruffing finesse|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: even with 52 cards in sigth it's difficult :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|frankaus: it does help if u & part read the same book :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe should have tried putting the @S QT on first 2 rounds|pg||
nt|lmeili: good bid from EW|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|noodle:  yes and to encourage you play a middle card |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||

nt|tejjyid: not that it beats the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winners of this event will get an invitation and $6000 subsidy to attend the 2011 Yeh Bros Cup this coming April|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but highly likely to be flat|pg||
nt|sybarra: just one of those hands :(|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, nowt you can do|pg||
nt|noodle:  re hi every one :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi and welcome |pg||
nt|sybarra2: not sure what happened all  |pg||
nt|panja: the layout, though, is a little anti-% as W did not have any @H honour for his 5 cards|pg||
nt|bobholl: will probably loose 1 imp but wise anyway|pg||
nt|bobholl: they reached and played par |pg||

mb|p|nt|mwigor: in this situation gosney could probably have won the diamond unless he needed martin to switch|pg||
nt|noodle:  tx shirley   it seems Milne will need another comeback|pg||
nt|sharkey: N will put pressure on East now|pg||
mb|2N!|an|asking|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+|pg||
nt|gambit: looks like a part-score battle and the reigning suit should prevail|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: N-S  CC: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/ConventionCards/Open/Chinese-Taipei/Hwang-Yang-Wu-Wang.aspx|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: I dont understand 2 NT when N knows he'll land in 4@H...|pg||
nt|bobholl: i guess he wants to know wheather he should save against 5@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: only promises 4-4 in M|pg||
mb|4N|nt|noodle:  the imp is not much  but the fact they ended up in a great spot on a tough hand can boost morale early in the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat  Hans-Nunn play Weak NT   3rd/4th Strong|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Ain't 6.000$ a peace of cake? Is for my workers. OK. Stop now.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe only at the 2 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: both pairs play precision here.|pg||
nt|bobholl: see if they can reach 7 ?! @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Both pairs play precision here|pg||
mb|5C|nt|tejjyid: I wold call it a lucky spot, not a great spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: false pref wit 1-2 ???|pg||
nt|noodle:  i agree :)|pg||
nt|noodle:  better lucky than good, though :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: auto 2@S, IMO|pg||
nt|gambit: 1@D?|pg||
nt|panja: best to pass dbl|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt 2nt or pass ?|pg||
nt|panja: easier at MP's...but pass should still be a good choice at IMP|pg||
nt|panja: now, withouth source of tricks and with 25HCP, NS might end up in an unmakeable 3Nt|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: A small intimate audience here|pg||
nt|bobholl: same as before |pg||
nt|bobholl: but now bad suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: he now knows not to i guess|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: it's not a disastrous position, but it is difficult|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening bids are getting worse by the second imho|pg||
nt|sybarra: we saw it yesterday, maybe a repeat|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake never saw an 11 count he couldn't open|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [most of] Milne team is looking for 3rd straight NOT final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 2010 they were 2nd in both this event and the Spring NOT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with a slight change to team for the Spring event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Milne-Whibley were semi-finalists in 2009 while still New Zealanders|pg||
nt|sybarra: then maybe we are all getting old |pg||
nt|sybarra2: 1 @D= 0-4  not a good hand |pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3@C 5nt ?|pg||
nt|lmeili: weak NT for NS|pg||
nt|lmeili: both pairs play precision|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW wont want to dfend 2@C, so hopefully for them, they will find their spade fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 1 to high|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mwigor: i think i like pass|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we "wrong sided" spades here |pg||
nt|sybarra2: perhaps|pg||
nt|lmeili: except EW's NT range 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: hi Phoebe and Steve|pg||
nt|lmeili: hard for EW to find their @s contract|pg||
nt|lmeili: hi|pg||
pc|hA|nt|noodle:  often pass is better when really crappy hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  44 in minors an nothing in majors is asking for trouble in the competitive bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should go quickly |pg||
nt|panja: touch and go|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: well that's unusual|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: which, since you have complete rubish, may be a good argument for the PASS|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i don't know wheather that 's old fashioned josephine|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 2 @C = stayman|pg||
nt|bobholl: it works :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he will ne ok here unless they manage the @D play not easy|pg||
nt|bobholl: shen would open 3@S i guess :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: I think there is a contradiction between overcalling on not much, and bidding game here on the East cards|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and from there is looks like "junk stayman" |pg||
nt|sybarra2: am told 1 @D = 07 |pg||
nt|sybarra2: sorry thought less |pg||
nt|bobholl: @C handling will decide this 3nT|pg||
nt|panja: @S power lead ...unblock @SJ if you have it...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S seems like confirmation of the 3@S bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|panja: the @DT will be ninth trick as QJ fall|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he gets his @C tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Patrick will seek to ruff a heart in the closed hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panja: 3@H 3@D @CA @SA sure tricks..|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gambit: Q@H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panja: @C could give one more...also, possibilities of endplay...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C 1 ruff and akq akq|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tejjyid: pass is better - that is pass of 1@S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|gambit: q@C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: easy from here,  but good idea,  not back in dummy too many times|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 5@D not doubled in other room|pg||
nt|rodal f: See -2 at the beginning. The end.|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doesn't know he gets 3@D tricks so how to handle @C for 3 tricks|pg||

pc|sA|nt|suketbombi: 4 i mean|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tejjyid: A number of spectators pointing out that opening isn't the prtoblem, not open 1@D is the problem|pg||
nt|noodle:  did martin bloom play 2nd set ( I was off ) ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: was my guess too |pg||
pc|s4|nt|mwigor: looks like 9 tricks|pg||

nt|sybarra2: S= Patrick |pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: with a major indication on the left....you could get chopped for -500 or so..|pg||
mb|3N|nt|noodle:  some people think it is easier to bid 1@d over 1@c than the opposite, hence the 1@c bid... i prefer 1@d on 44 minors|pg||
nt|noodle:  hi MJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play 1@C=2+ with transfer responses|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS carding  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs NT the also play "OddBall" in following to declarer's suit|pg||
nt|noodle:  now we ll have a real canadian commentator :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer to open my best suit of 4-4|pg||
nt|noodle:  opening best suit on weak hands is good for lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb guys,  checking other room |pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok n/s found spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  I think EW played the junior trial the week before the NOT , right ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's my view|pg||
nt|gambit: I don't like 1NT rebid with a singleton but others disagree|pg||
nt|panja: but out here..it could even make|pg||
nt|bobholl: true but ...|pg||

nt|bobholl: patrick happy to bid 3nt they are not using lebensohl here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: great explanation!!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wonder if N thought about passing 2@Hx?|pg||
nt|sharkey: May have resulted in 1100 after @H lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: patrick surely would have found that |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: what does 5@D show?       faith|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if that showing faith means he doesn't trust partner's penalty doubles:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish is now complaining that he didn't know 3C was alerted|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West, maybe|pg||
nt|mwigor: they both played in youth week|pg||
nt|noodle:  they show stamina then|pg||
nt|mwigor: but not in the trial for the australian youth team|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like this auction at all|pg||

nt|sybarra2: precision,...so not our style|pg||
nt|bobholl: terrible @S distribution :(|pg||

nt|peachy: Hi Al nd spectators|pg||
nt|peachy: dont see others|pg||
nt|sharkey: on the bidding - yes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: accepts the transfer:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  seven card suits are hard to describe in middle of auctions|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley shrugged and ish isn't pursing it|pg||
nt|noodle:  as spec points out NS have a different system of answers to 1@c  it might tip the scales|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Indeed, if you have complex methods 1@C is better, as leaving more room to exercise them|pg||
nt|noodle:  I also have a rattle theory when it comes to bridge gadgets|pg||
nt|noodle:  it goes like this :|pg||
nt|noodle:  if you give a kid a rattle he will shake it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's true|pg||
nt|noodle:  MJ went to the other room presumably|pg||
nt|bobholl: even if he misguesses now he will make|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he thinks rather long about it |pg||
pc|hK|nt|noodle:  hung and smirnov are well known on BBO :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think South snaffled the Youth pairs?|pg||
nt|mwigor: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|mwigor: it looks like hung has hit on the best lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Strange to see that some still give from the Mol. HUM. Pass over 1@S? |pg||
nt|noodle:  with a full opener i d raise as E personally|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S back and 5 made |pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: HE's very quiet if here|pg||

nt|vugraphzzq: Wu usually not play fast as I observe|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|mwigor: the consequence being that he was still on lead after two rounds of @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is here, just being his quiet self|pg||
nt|fifee:  good switch|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wei De picked up 8 IMPs on Bd 3 where EW stopped at the 4 level|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: Peake did raise to 2@S   --  but won't get any extra credit if both contracts make|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, it's a purely academic point on this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: commentator's noise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand, i actually like Whibley's PASS -- partner now KNOWS 3@S support  and  won't go overboard|pg||
nt|sybarra: knowing him,  will speak when "needed"|pg||
nt|noodle:  does anyone play unusual vs unusual ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|noodle:  Silver used to call K from Kx a journalist lead, cause if it works you can end up in the paper (of course here it was the unbid suit)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: won't make much difference though|pg||
nt|mwigor: hung does well trying to kill the diamond suit in dummy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: no reason for @S finesse i guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: will he play for @D 44|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|noodle:  I don t know if it s standard but when i pass a 1 level response partner can be sure I have a 3rd seat opener and act accordingly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: plus -- what can opponents do that is bad?   if they balance in @C  West knows about the 8-card fit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tejjyid: well, not me|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: if they balance in @H --- East would love to defend|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello Ed,  welcome|pg||
nt|gambit: wel ed|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: in OR|pg||
pc|s6|nt|noodle:  a nice way to play it is to use 3@c as @hs weak or strong  3@d as spades weak or strong and 3 of a major as invitational|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody, from windy central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|ahalim: he heard you Bob|pg||

mb|p|nt|mwigor: not that tough|pg||
nt|noodle:  4@s coming up|pg||
nt|gambit: this is going down several|pg||
nt|bobholl: only fair (30% i guess)|pg||
nt|panja: this would be a good 4@H a priori..it goes down because @C finesse loses|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  the 6@D does not need the @S guess can get 6@D 3@H 1@C & 2@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessing the @S is now knowing your opponents :)|pg||

nt|mwigor: almost unplayable any other way|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: hmm maybe not|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no way is it 100%; it's by arrangement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat, great shape  @S suit -- automatic 3rd seat opener|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I'd be more likley to bid 3@H - not so successful here|pg||
nt|noodle:  I like 3N better than 2@S :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact I bet he'd open 1@S in ANY seat|pg||
nt|fifee: 6@C still a plus for Yeh since 5@D is pretty icy|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|frankaus: green V red + youth - 5 level NP|pg||
nt|sybarra2: some times you get to bid your 6 card suit |pg||
nt|bobholl: he doesn't have the entries for the 5th @H i guess|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fifee: looks like 4 tricks for NS at 6@C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra2: and sometimes your pard even bid 2 @H |pg||
nt|ahalim: you can even make 6NT by S, pinning the @H 109|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: well they will get to 6@D now|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes he has @SK is the last entry on the @C lead 2 entries in @DS set up the @HS if @S lead no problem ona trump lead too 2 entries will be available|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mwigor: david beauchamp thinks that south should have doubled 5@h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, to stop anyone bidding 5@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: although we can see that they can make 650 if they bid on|pg||
nt|mwigor: taking the money in 5@h is a much safer option|pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears that may be the case - Alerted?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|noodle:  agreed  this ia a forcing pass situation double as 2 losers is relatively normal (by arrangement of course)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: S hand doesn't look like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duplicate auctions -- i must admit i would have bid a mere 3@H with East|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems about right to me as well|pg||
nt|sharkey: Or 2@C have different meanings?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: no :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be they were not sure after the double ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  only thing missed is possibly wrong siding this NT:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i can see "like C" written by prescott|pg||
nt|panja: right...@S loser to add too|pg||
nt|bobholl: after @S ace @C back -2 otherwise -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 2@S is nat and inv|pg||
nt|panja: looking at the two hands...NS have only 23 HCP, 9-card fit..a second fit in @S...but South's @S are poor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: explained by Patrick|pg||
nt|panja: the 2@S try had a misplaced emphasis..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: and Yang apparently didn't know that|pg||
nt|panja: still, 4@H would make with @SA and @CK onside..and @S3-2...so that is about 17%...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oops:) |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course - i wouldn't overcall 2@H  but that is a different topic :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: did i say 6?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: That's an ex post facto conclulsion -- maybe opening and planning to pass 1N (unless they play SNAP, Strong Nt After Pass) isn't optimal strategy.  But I'm not one to question ...|pg||
nt|othered1: someone as experienced and successful as south.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he can make this too finese the @D 9 and guess the @S:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: has no other option only the problem is to guess the @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@H probably meant we have all 5 aces but even than 7@D ...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: yes my 30% was overestimated|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: To many loosers at S. Why not trust ure pard and bid then???     If ure pard act.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that the 1700 from 3rd Quarter is showing up on the ABF site, which reflects scores entered by the PLAYERS -- so it must be right   [even if hard to fathom]|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S just made|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: 8 tricks but ...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mwigor: same contract in both rooms - so i predict another flat board|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobholl: he hoped his @H k was worth much more|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugrapha2: so looks like C transfer, positive acceptance, and then shutdown|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe as a passed hand you have alittle more scope to bid 2@S - but must surely be rock bottom for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: without hesitation ,  Shen returns a @D|pg||
nt|lmeili: important here to kill summy's last entry |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes esp. South |pg||
nt|sybarra2: (or I know S best)|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be the 8 of @C ?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: well begun winning with J|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: at the beginning of the set, rooms are opened with the Official Running totals -- regardless of what BBO Vugraph thought when room closed|pg||
nt|lmeili: dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I like the sound of summy|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he will make ths @S guess is the only problem|pg||
nt|bobholl: alas|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nooooo|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: Agree S would have a clear cut 3@D bid standard methods - preferable play on 5-4 fit vs 5-2.....|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: those starting totals are entered manually|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we've seen a lot of singleton Kings this match -- twice in the first set there were hands that had 2 singleton Ks|pg||
nt|noodle:  I guess tom will tell us what happened on bd 5 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I Was going to say; 4@D-4@S;4NT (NOT BW)-5@C; 5@S-5N;7@H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but the key is NOT Blackwood|pg||
nt|panja: so many 11-12 pointer openings this session...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Shen blames Shih's @D2 was not showed up|pg||
nt|sharkey: If the min or max is as explained by Yu clearly there shud be some alerts along the way|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+   i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: sorry , just my guess :(|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobholl: 6@S is on but not biddable|pg||
nt|lmeili: EW's 4@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not sure what purpose 2@s served...in OR, S bid 3@d (puppet stayman) which makes more sense on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously playing 4-suit transfers it is easier to make mild slam try when partner does NOT like your suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be now it is (vulnarable opponents are not mad )|pg||
nt|lmeili: even 6|pg||
nt|sharkey: and you may very well be correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: No inverce here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: SHould end in 5@H|pg||
nt|lmeili: i think so|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS would be crazy to push them (wuth 5@S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was wondering what Adam [Edgtton] was going to respond|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Although you'd be unlikely to bid 7@H as it needs a fair bit, like 3-2 trumps & @S not worse than 4-2|pg||
nt|noodle:  looks like the kids pushed to the good grand|pg||
nt|bobholl: they are a priori more probably than 14-15 :)|pg||
nt|panja: this 3N will become interesting if N ducks @CK or Q first round|pg||
nt|bobholl: now a chance :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: can make 12 tricks, @D's and @S friendly|pg||
nt|bobholl: his @D are a tad weak so ...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tejjyid: I Was assuming 1@S..|pg||
nt|sharkey: East showed respect for the colors....|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gambit: south must bid 3NT|pg||
nt|panja: write Bob, they are..and a wide range system cannot do justice to all 11-12 pointers|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mwigor: south opened 2@h in the other room and is declarer in 4@h|pg||
nt|mwigor: (presumably this showed some 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i don't know their NT response ranges -- suspect 1@C-2@C requires 5+@C|pg||
nt|noodle:  maybe the bad grand|pg||
nt|noodle:  but they trailed so it makes sense|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's not bad|pg||
nt|panja: right even..|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: wow!|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: great bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: bidding may lead to a 6@D or a 6nt slam not unreasonable |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@S no 4 card major|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|noodle:  junior 2@h @H + a good mood|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D covers opened with most 4@C & 4@D hands|pg||
nt|gambit: N|pg||
nt|gambit: wos|pg||
nt|gambit: wos|pg||
nt|gambit: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and 9 off the top |pg||
nt|lmeili: i can realize why E bid 6@h right away, after 67 imps behind, they need some hands to pick up|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugrapha2: heh, true|pg||
nt|bobholl: not incorrect  800 or so in 2@C|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mwigor: 3NT will fail so long as the defense gets it right|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough bid for North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid shows Strong NT|pg||
nt|panja: now, after @CK and @C to King or Q, North must duck!|pg||
nt|panja: after @SK rather..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 4th best lead form N-S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt inquiry and 3@C shows 5@Cs|pg||
nt|bobholl: that helps for his @D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@D natural |pg||
pc|c3|nt|tejjyid: I recall that 57% is the tipping point - it'd beclose to that|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  cleverly avoiding the 5-4 @h fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry i meant 7@S :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he knows 9-11 and 5@Cs now|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 5 bad @Cs he knows|pg||
nt|bobholl: will he try 3@D now ?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a 3@D will elicit a 3@H from North|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: for most [many?] 2/1 players --  the 1@D response either denies 4+@H/@S or hand is strong enough to invite over a weak NT rebid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|noodle:  also note that south has has the 7@d for mosy hands  very important in junior bridge|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mwigor: hard to see how they could get it wrong in fact|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Patrick hesitate to put down 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: unlucky :(|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: If 2@C it normaly tell 5@C at W.      Anyhow it is the best force for check cards|pg||
nt|bobholl: safety play with nice effect|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sharkey: West may have done better by stepping up with @CA and continue @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: sure entries for E are not there|pg||
nt|sharkey: no entries now...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: hands like the previous one and this one  are not good for ateam trailing with 32 imps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tejjyid: I think that's more true of North America than AUstralia, although I'm not in the game much these days so it may have changed here|pg||
nt|panja: good|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: Gosney responded with a transfer response of 1@S, so North never bid|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the slam is not bad if @S finese works will make most of the time if not needs huge luck in@Ds @DK singleton or doubleton with W|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|s3|nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tejjyid: That was the bid I expected here - transfer responses very popular|pg||
nt|noodle:  in north america need high level events (top bracket KO or nationals) to be allowed methods like that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think Adam is playing with any regular partners|pg||
nt|noodle:  very restrictive system laws here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: true, it's not a good method for the casual partnership|pg||
nt|noodle:  it is my opinion that such rules deter young people from the game|pg||
nt|noodle:  that s why it is so refreshing to have BBO|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe - I think the need for restrictions is overstated but I see the argument|pg||
nt|noodle:  ( end of shameless plug )|pg||
nt|tejjyid: The problem is it's hard to test in a revenue neutral way|pg||
nt|panja: the only problem is....S played @S9 ...on third round|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: let's be fair Normand -- the ACBL has more rules than that to deter young and innovative players|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nordman:) It's the problem ure union have since they are to late by thinking. Free Norway as Romania - Hungary - Bulgaria and most others|pg||
nt|panja: so there is no quick entry back to S hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|noodle:  looks like hans nunn had a bad hand for the weak nt  -400 here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not ideal|pg||
nt|noodle:  are we getting the boot again ? :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tejjyid: For me there were always problems with dress codes :)|pg||
nt|panja: if W had a third Heart, that would have mattered, now now though|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: suit preference for @H , i believe|pg||

nt|bobholl: or just claimed :)|pg||
mb|2D!|an|weak , 4!h-4!s +|nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat = weak NT   so Hans must start with 1-suit|pg||

nt|bobholl: another 2@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: Nice matchpoints result for EW, but not very meaningful here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: just realized -- all of these australians are ex-pat Kiwis|pg||

nt|bobholl: E rather strong now |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@c interesting here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL was 4+@S or 4/5@S [which is how the Italians play it]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in North America, the standard is  1m-(1@H)-DBL = exactly 4@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the alert, I suspect 4/5|pg||
nt|andyv:  my comment regarding 3@c is that 2N seems very tempting with S hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no,he has a good constructive hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  y|pg||
nt|noodle:  ladies and gentleman, we have a match :)|pg||
nt|othered1: North, rightly to my eyes, avoided the 1@S response and got his suit with lots of tricks intothe auction immediately.|pg||
nt|fifee: looks like a good spot|pg||
nt|fifee: right ed. also he put them into game force so they can go slowly to investigate slam|pg||
nt|othered1: Might be tougher to get to than it looks to us|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4NT or double now|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no option but to collect 500:(:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: yes, he folded quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  i like the weak notrump non vul  either I have Acol ancestors or i m a chicken noodle|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the precision 1 @D I think again|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mwigor: when i played with paul that XX would have shown 4+@d|pg||
nt|mwigor: i doubt martin plays that though|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will they.....? Hard|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they alter range exclusively by seat  ---     marty bergen: vulnerability is for children|pg||
nt|noodle:  y all those players tell us vulnerability doesn t matter and stop playing :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: My best controled slam was bidded by 15HP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: harder for North to PASS after partner opens strong 1N|pg||
nt|noodle:  and we go -1100 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I found that the weak NT solves lot's of bidding problems, but it gves away a lot of information when it ISN"T opened (player is unblanaced) plus it's hard to compete sensibly ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after people bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *lots|pg||
nt|noodle:  use rubensold or similar methods :) lol|pg||
nt|tejjyid: deficit down to 21|pg||
nt|othered1: The @D void against partner's strong long suit could be a problem unless north can focus simply on trump quality.  Wonder if they have exclusion blackwood available in south's ...|pg||
nt|othered1: known long suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: interesting  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: what to lead with the N hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S here by East can give some problems here But look at 4@S oppenents will be content to double u and collect|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: assumes 2N would be natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: said 2nt would surely show 18-19 or so|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would think it would be but I'm guessing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: my guess is this shows 11+ and @C|pg||
nt|noodle:  we name the XX under strenght "kindergarden"  here|pg||
nt|noodle:  like :  you won t make it  yes i will  :)|pg||
nt|gambit: of course N will drive to game, but what game, spades best|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: both pairs play precision here|pg||
nt|bobholl: time for bart (a good convention)|pg||
nt|panja: this will be good 4@H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth can try 2NT or 3NT|pg||
nt|lmeili: disagreed with E's 4@s|pg||
pc|cK|nt|suketbombi: enxure @C and try @D:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: depends on yourf partners @H |pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: some might use it as Good/Bad  [so 3@C is better hand than 2N]|pg||
nt|noodle:  the method of using pass as 10+ balanced and transfers (starting with redouble) was suggested by Garozzo over a take out double and is gaining popularity|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pragmatic|pg||
nt|bobholl: good pass by N (south promised 4-6) or was it less than 5 ?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  could be but then 3@c would be alertable|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I don't expect these two using good/bad|pg||
nt|andyv:  they at least got to game|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: think I can see a "4+" scribble describing the double|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Phoebe Lin|pg||

nt|sybarra2: Paul Simon|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Pat Anderson |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: we've seen a lot of bid and made 5@D contracts today|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: Both sides fail at their 4-level contracts|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|mwigor: winning this in hand an banging down @cA will work well|pg||

nt|fifee: ty Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: she may know about the systems that I do |pg||
nt|lmeili: wow gave his p a difficult time, hope he can make the correct choice|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not often seen,  blkwd with void |pg||
nt|sybarra2: but they are playing ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see slam likely to fail|pg||
nt|bobholl: 11 tricks only so no problem but no gain either|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: wonder if that's simple blackwood or RKC.  If so, north still has no real clue whether slam makes at all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: presumably 4N was KC, but with a void it seems very misguided|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  definitely not a mp event:)|pg||

nt|sybarra2: in precision, does anyone know if the "reverse" was better hand?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|tejjyid: decalrer plans to pitch a @D, but it won't work|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D ruff @H and than @S|pg||
nt|othered1: What little I know of Precision, it only confirms long @D as well as a @S suit|pg||
nt|othered1: or at least real @D|pg||
nt|fifee: it confirms no 5cd @S and not balanced, wouldn't you say?|pg||
nt|bobholl: S may get placed :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: Myfeeling is that a @D was more testing than the trumps|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this was a goodhand for a "negative punt" with the quack of @D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tricks all over but no use:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Identical bidding OR|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d4|nt|noodle:  rabbi s rule :  when king is singleton, play the ace :)|pg||
nt|othered1: if he had 5@S and 6@D what would he have opened?  They're not playinig Robinson Precision are they? :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: now AQ if sopades and clyub jack|pg||
nt|othered1: (after the great Steve Robinson, who insists that if you have a 5-card major you must open it, rather than a longer minor)|pg||
nt|fifee: true|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|noodle:  we need a point count that discredits jacks :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think a few have been invented|pg||
nt|noodle:  y|pg||
nt|tejjyid: just not poularised|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that @H 6 wasn't the friendliest LAvinthal signal|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but East can't pitch both his @D and still has a trump to lose, so it won't matter|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h3|pc|s8|nt|tejjyid: and that's 9 tricks (barring accidents)|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: bye normand, c u again|pg||

nt|tejjyid: YOure typing seems up to it ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 rounds of @H then @D?    West may not have enough entries  [South can prevent @SJ from being entry]|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Peake does well|pg||
nt|sybarra2: wd guys|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: totally moot point because North will never lead @H on this auction|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and played !|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  well NS finally get on the board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: something like that, getting another round of @D in early seems critical|pg||
nt|gambit: Kind of dull hands so far, hopefully we get some excitement soon |pg||
nt|panja: mirror image hands with EW|pg||

nt|bobholl: does E know that he can be this good ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: no 2@D short @D ?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mwigor: martin makes 3NT for 10 IMPs when the other table played a partscore|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 3N?   2@D??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room in 3@H South|pg||
nt|tejjyid: suit quality is not so retro|pg||
nt|sybarra2: havent been friendly hands,  but also not exciting|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW getting short of boards now if they are to do something about the deficit|pg||
mb|d!|nt|tejjyid: There's an argument for NOrth raising, just because he has support|pg||
nt|bobholl: support double |pg||
mb|r|an|club honor|nt|vugrapha2: ish keeps on mixing it up :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: funky multi |pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 depends on @S guess but not to good a contract|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  now 4@h?|pg||
nt|panja: 6Nt will require @S guess or...good play..stripping NS and endplaying with @DQ...6@D will play better, same elimination and endplay..|pg||
nt|bobholl: they get another chance with a promoted @C K|pg||
nt|ahalim: they don't play the classic Precision 2@D anymore|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume xx shows @C honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@S invitational or to play?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra2: or majors wk |pg||
nt|lmeili: precision here for this table|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C you mean :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thinks his hand is too good for 2@S rebid -- or maybe 2@D was a transfer advance?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like the West raise on Hx in the pre-empted suit|pg||
nt|noodle:  NS needed a good board to change momentum  (if there is such a thing)|pg||
nt|fifee: 9 tricks at 3nt with a @D lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: not alerted|pg||
nt|sharkey: N shud raise in my view|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: good valuein a trump lead|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes it often allows a lead|pg||
nt|panja: in 6@C....take @C finesse, remove trumps, eliminate @Hs, then play @DAK and back and claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@d looked like LR|pg||
nt|mwigor: if alex wins the first round of @c his pips provide him with a second stopper|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It certainly feels like there is a momentum when you're playing|pg||
nt|fifee: @HQ conveniently dropping :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H now ?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: nice lead |pg||
nt|sybarra2: how does N know that?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 quick tricks surely :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Indeed|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: sure wish i had a convention card or notes :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: cold 4@H missed |pg||
nt|ahalim: so they can stop one level lower :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: no surprise --  trump lead would have worked better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Sartaj also expected West to have SOMETHING in @D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: s the world's worst opening leader, I'm loath to criticise - but this auction screamed trump |pg||
nt|ahollan1: my 2nd choice would have been @C lead|pg||
nt|panja: y, right bob, sorry, i tend to type too fast ..|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  don't need one to see this won't be successful|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: whibley asked something, to which ish said "no discussion"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well correction of 4@H to 4@S surely rules OUT transfer advances|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was Double Dummy Hopeless|pg||
nt|bobholl: this 130 points extra he will may be regret :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 10 tricks here, as west, trying for 9, won't try to run either rounded suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 4th best lead for N-S|pg||
nt|bobholl: we could continue in dutch but i don't think that will be appreciated :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i double your claim -- in college systems were devised to make ME the opening leader|pg||
nt|panja: a good player will take first @C finesse with a small @C from W hand...to cater to a stiff @CK..|pg||
nt|panja: amazing EW players..very selfless...one must appreciate that...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mwigor: its a common mistake made that people hold up automatically - overlooking the possibility of another trick in the suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I would have paid  money to see East make that error|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: let's not play together ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not for money, anyway :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oof   STILL no trump|pg||
nt|ahalim: only by the dutch kibitzers|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 overtricks now  may be|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|gambit: I Love Leb. Great convention. If a partner does not play it, I know they are not expert. Sad, but true. BRB|pg||
nt|panja: W opted for 6@C that E would have played...and E converted to 6Nt that W is playing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra2: and lets cash |pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  for all we know 2@h could have been a help suit game try if 2@d was a limit raise or better.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tejjyid: now, let's set up @D..|pg||
nt|sybarra2: agree Cam |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and I play it every where|pg||
nt|fifee: rubensohl has its merits as well. there are combinations of both conventions around|pg||
nt|bobholl: still has to find the @S queen |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunate game to go down|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: or (at least) intended to reveal that later|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S is doomed, and the huddle makes it a certainty|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: I think South should lead low|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: actually that could be -- if 2@D absolutely shows @S support, then 2@H as a probe that may not have length does make sense|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes but need partnership agreements for those|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: until further notice all contracts are 50%|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they either make   ....   or they don't|pg||
nt|fifee: for sure as with any transfer responses|pg||
nt|sybarra2: huddle really not important |pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: with that combination, East may rise Ace to block suit when honours are split|pg||
nt|othered1: so you'll back your judgment and try for overtricks as west?  Remember, north's lead was a lowish (but not lowest) @S and it could be he with the @S length.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: imo|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mwigor: alex might as well claim now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @C pitch by Liam|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh those 2@S :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i didnt say anything about overtricks. but they are very likely to happen by themselves|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra2: well that helped|pg||
nt|bobholl: try @H now can't cost|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mwigor: he makes 9 tricks if north has @hA and 8 otherwise|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: ooops  it's Michael this set|pg||
nt|noodle:  3@s will fare better than 2N that went -3 at other table|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth can console himself by thinking they're only 50's|pg||
nt|noodle:  i suspect it is technical difficulties ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Must be, all these guys are pretty quick|pg||
nt|noodle:  now MJ is here|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|bobholl: patrick knows how to play his cards :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tejjyid: now, trump promotion saves NS|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very amusing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess declarer could never overcome South holding 5 minors & @S10|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes i didn't say those @S were bad :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will finesse @D now i guess|pg||
nt|panja: now..the endplay is on..but is risky..no reason to reject @D finesse for an endplay|pg||

nt|andyv:  W will dbl here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even with a @D underlead   3N didn't have 9 tricks    that should make South feel better|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: sorry   my [inane] comment was for board  24|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish did observe that DAK lead would make 3NT easy last board|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may be more concerned about the lead rather than take chances|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so really Yeh Brothers (sponsors of this and other tourneys) team is ahead|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Sidney alerts 2 @H , but Patrick didn't.|pg||
nt|gambit: 3NT NS cold, but after E bold Michaels bid, VUL, who knows where they might have landed or how big the penalty wudl be, more than +430  tha is for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: The correct carryover for Weide(N-S) is 13.5 imps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: ish announces "this'll get us right back in it, partner"|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: "don't spend it all at once!"|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is a vul game |pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like that much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to the point that  2-level = 5 cards, 3-level = 6   so Nunn forced to open 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: and "luck" is with him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW wanting to yell    DIRECTOR -- We Were Robbed|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so what was 2 @H alert?|pg||
nt|gambit: 3NT, no other choice, pard is marked with clubs|pg||
nt|ahalim: 4@D looks like some fit-bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: good 4@H well bid this time :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tejjyid: I'd rather bid @D 1st & @S the next time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: full credit to partnership style for this Bloom pickup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: they've invested many hands in it over the years|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Their records must show it's a winner for them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are they both still in their 20s??|pg||
nt|gambit: Yiles|pg||
nt|chilloncan: you arent making game if S has garbage, and if he has something he is likely to double and that may be +500 against no game|pg||
nt|sybarra2: should squeak this home |pg||
nt|bobholl: sounds stronger than 4@H so they won't bid 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  to bad payoff isn't more than 8-9 imps|pg||
nt|noodle:  problem is now W overstates his values|pg||
pc|s7|nt|noodle:  but E has seen him play :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East seems to knowhow little West has|pg||
nt|noodle:  all by arrangement i d guess :)|pg||

nt|tejjyid: No|pg||
nt|bobholl: what would a direct 1NT have been ?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|noodle:  me too   but maybe he s a poor card holder and never has a good hand...|pg||
nt|gambit: You give up a potentially huge penalty for a part score? Not winning bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Hu didn't ask.|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but from N @D discard he knew|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he has 2@C he needs only 1 ruff |pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: nasty @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: loosing a trick in every suit :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: @DA asking for attitude is much more common now than when i learned to finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: way back then Ace asked unblock or count  but now King is the power lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at hand now ---  seems there are 7@D tricks available against 3N|pg||
nt|ahalim: except trumps of course :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|othered1: I tened to agree about passing 1@S, which most play implies the balanced NT hand.  But it also may imply a shaky @S stopper, which isn't the case here,  |pg||
pc|sA|nt|panja: 1Nt will make 1...3@C would have made 3|pg||
nt|bobholl: rubens loves transfers :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: could loose a@H too if they continue @S|pg||

nt|bobholl: this is a kind of 3 or 5 hand @H 3-1 and only 3 made :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: Yes, I think NS in other romm probably feeling robbed as well|pg||
nt|panja: and now, cashing @DA...|pg||

pc|s8|nt|psridhar: couple of guesses involved in 4@s..|pg||
nt|psridhar: but favoourite to make -once the @h ace is seen with W, the opener shd hv @c ace, so 4@s rates to make|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 6N West looks best|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 1@S-2@C, may not be so easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not really sure where Open Room auction went wrong -- maybe the 5@C bid over 4N was wrong Key Card response??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: either that or the trump Q was on East's mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome back patient patrons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other room using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|fifee: 3nt NS or 4@S EW ?|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|lmeili: Yeh are very good in slam bidding much better than Wei De|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cud be some fireworks here...|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|bobholl: now has to find a better @S bid :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugrapha2: looks like it is a 2+C meaning for 1C opening|pg||
mb|d|an|neg|nt|tejjyid: OK, that confirms EW are playing 15-17, not 14-16|pg||
nt|gambit: not after this start|pg||
nt|fifee: if N doubles, then Patrick may pass|pg||
nt|othered1: many players around here play double of overcall of 1N at 3-level as negative, while double at 2-level is for penalty.  Not something I like to play.|pg||
nt|gambit: nice time for neg dble|pg||
nt|fifee: leb makes it easier at the 2 level|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least a 13-15 NT ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 or 3 @S now ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tejjyid: 2@S or 3@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Gong whispered to Patrick , looks like 3S is inv|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: best lesson i learned at rubber bridge -- if you win $20  that calls for a $30 celebration|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|noodle:  I think they upgrade quite freely though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (via the machinery)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 15|pg||
nt|tejjyid: any good 14 is a 15|pg||
nt|gambit: 4d is more thoghtful than 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so 1 @D for both looks like 0-6/7 |pg||
nt|sharkey: @C suit lost now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: run baby run!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now, if u'r not playing 2/1 this is an ugly buit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *bit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a space-filling 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2@C 100% game force, then 2N gets my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+  but 4@C & 4@D usually opens 1@C|pg||
nt|panja: strong 1@C..|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't show his @C now as in a natural system|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@H will not make though, I think|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt has better chances as the cards lay|pg||
nt|panja: all precision players...pass over 1@C first, and then late double...indicates opening strength at least..|pg||
nt|fifee: usually takes 8+ HCP for a positive response|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Unless East comes back with 4 NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@D is off 1 - 5@C has chances...|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: definitely - thi sis the hand which justifies 2/1 (maybe)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as we see -- it let's partner clarify hand with 3@C|pg||
nt|lmeili: some players might bid 3@s instead of 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: 3rd/low for N-S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  I might have bid 1@h first time with N hand just get away from this mess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, so now we can start cue-ing early, or maybe even BW with 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems now a couple cue bids then some form of Blackwood should get to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: andrew types faster :(|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I dn't think BW is the right way to go|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess it makes as much or as little sense after a weak NT as after a stronger NT|pg||
nt|fifee: hard to play 3nt if you bid 4@D though|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tejjyid: THat seems likely to get a director call|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt might make because @C suit dies early..|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugrapha2: apparently they use 1C=1+C and 1D=5+D, according to heather|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess EW don't have any agreements here regarding passing runout bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange not to dbl -- i would assume Whibley's pass was forcing|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (but it's a long standing prejudice)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liam's hand getting better|pg||
nt|sharkey: This may be another nail in the coffin for EW|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: 4@C was just natural force|pg||
nt|lmeili: Gong & Fu have the excellent understanding, normally we'll bid game without invitation with Gong's hand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  it would seem so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: certainly if you can use it at the 4@C level, it's better|pg||
nt|gambit: 5d is a sound contrat |pg||
nt|panja: N is tempted to bid 3Nt??|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H with that North hand is not really justified|pg||
nt|bobholl: thin @C stop :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: True, but some Precisioners, both past and contemporary, have an intermediate bid to show a h and of about 7 good to 7+ points.  I like that approach,|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think he'd prefered to be in 3@S X|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|panja: good decision by North..excellent restraint..|pg||
nt|panja: now..there might be a bit of tricky play here...@CAK and @C for a ruff..first thing..|pg||
nt|panja: but that will endplay West|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 4@S made(likely) in other direction |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|noodle:  2@D was probably GF checkback|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@C as a natural force seems to be wasting space - why not cue 3@D on the way?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Again, West is making the decision and doesn't have enough information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully 5@C = 1/4 Key Cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: y|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugrapha2: pass is low-variance... opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: lead a @D!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: why would you disturb 2@D if you had correct information?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction screams @C lead so 3N doesn't appear to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ummmm screams @C lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tejjyid: The @C QJ are invisble - they bid with filth & East has had no chance to show that he has a good hand|pg||
nt|othered1: rather 6 good to 7+|pg||
nt|othered1: Lets responder get values in, then can bid the hand naturally.|pg||
nt|fifee: me too. wei precision had a jump to 2 of the major to show a 6 cd suit and 5-7 hcp|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's a good start|pg||
pc|h6|nt|drewsky: Ill bet that 4@C was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still not easy to take 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tejjyid: The've got to the right contract, so success vindicates their method|pg||
nt|noodle:  always depends if it was a bidding mistake or a mistaken explanation|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: what does S discard that he can play back|pg||
nt|panja: interesting, should S ruff next Club or discard?|pg||
nt|panja: S can ruff small..|pg||
nt|panja: and then play A and back any suit..|pg||
nt|sharkey: Misguess @C and @HJ - not likely|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  and trump lead is called for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Liam Milne -- 3rd player in the triad confirmed 4@C was NOT ace ask|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the best play for 4@D works  IN ISOLATION  but Milne doesn't know he has 2 entries to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very niced unblock of @D9!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he will make 4@D without abandoning the entry to hand|pg||
nt|panja: @HT is the entry to cash its winner in Dummy|pg||
nt|panja: ruff higher than @H7 of course..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: i.e.  what hand would want to punish 1@C but rest in 1@H undoubled|pg||
nt|panja: brilliant|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: this is a bad game but makes on good guessing|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lmeili: careless play|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lmeili: @sAK then @h or @d|pg||
nt|fifee: had pre emptive value as well|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: duh -- he's a passed hand  thanks Mark|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it does, but I would call the director to find out|pg||
nt|bobholl: not anymore|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobholl: 1 down is good bridge :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gambit: now just a question of avoidance and W will never get the lead|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N isn't all that silly, as north must have sound high card values to force the 4-level.|pg||
nt|lmeili: can loose 2 @s 2@d and 1@h|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  I think even with a passed hand it's a force for one round (maybe up to 1NT)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still seems strange|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done :)|pg||

nt|othered1: If partner decides not to stay fixed opposite a weakish NT, that's his problem.  And with significant distribution, partner can pull (1=4=6=2, for example)if shaded.|pg||
nt|lmeili: if S has @HK he just needs to keep 2@h|pg||
nt|othered1: I was thinking of the 1@H used by the first successful Precision team in the USA, perhaps Altman-Smith, who used the low intermediate bid.  Others, perhaps even some forms of ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Meckwell, use it today|pg||
nt|fifee: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2 overtricks??|pg||

nt|ahalim: and you call that good bridge ? :):):)|pg||
nt|bobholl: enough for 1nt ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: maybe 3@C/2N shows full weight, with 3 @C and a bad hand yu can just bid 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: all pass i guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: its just an expression :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: hahaha|pg||
mb|r|nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is a Support DBL situation|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H now..|pg||
nt|bobholl: not 4@H i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: Both of these bids are vaguely comparable to Blue Team Club agreements over 1@C|pg||
nt|othered1: with east's pass here, this is headed to a quiet 41C|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: or sapdes|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone for 3N by S?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: We do|pg||
nt|bobholl: he foresaw that problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: it must also show a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This one might be worth 2.5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S normally 6@S but 5 allowed if "great suit"    you be the judge|pg||
nt|othered1: it looks like they've abandoned the classic Precision 2@D (tricolor, short @D)|pg||
nt|panja: if N had started with a 1Nt response, there was some chance of stopping in 3@H..I guess this will have be 4@H now..|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  N will bid 3@d or 3@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: not sure if good/bad or what|pg||
nt|noodle:  3 x 3N game pick ups for Bloom|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 of @H comes down :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: looks like lebensohl|pg||
nt|bobholl: this helps a lot |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: well, they never got close  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I think 2N was relay to 3@c to get out|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should now bid 3N and answer the question (or redbl to show first round control)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: scramble 2NT is also sensible... south can't have values after two passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but a reasonable sequence for 2N to show "2 places to play"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  should Nunn bid 4@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: again Mark beats me to the type|pg||
nt|panja: this will not be easy..|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H much easier|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: I gues 2@C is 2-way; 19-21 balanced or...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: To those new here , both pairs play precision|pg||
nt|fifee: but it already hit the floor :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and a claim button sometimes also|pg||
nt|othered1: EW have a great save, and often a make at the 5-level here, yet didn't choose to get into the auction.  I'd guess many would try to get the red 2-suiter in after the black opening ...|pg||
nt|othered1: and response, then west won't let go early|pg||
nt|sharkey: West bid 2@H immediately to show a weak opener - no interest defending 2@C x|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to guess (very)well to make |pg||
pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: well, I would, but I'd expec a touch more from 3@C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@D is Xfer, or ...|pg||
nt|othered1: On slightly different shapes, this could be a double game swing.  Here it's only a game v. save.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and play of @D suit to come.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ish and whibley are joking about the DQJ behind the screen before thelead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since only one entry to hand -- after @S lead must rely upon @D2-2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mildly surprising to pick up in that way against a junior team|pg||
nt|gambit: It is  a crazy system when yoo open your singleton wth 44-14- |pg||
nt|othered1: some are even crazier, requiring no @D at all . . . |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: South's heart bid silenced West a bit|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is lucky... lack of entries to his hand will prevent him from messing up the @d suit|pg||
nt|panja: with AQ and A, K in side suits....S should have opted to raise 3@H rather than bid 3Nt.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: NS carding upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|lmeili: in fact S has 2 choices either to guess right @h or to play @cA on side|pg||
nt|sybarra2: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open/Chinese-Taipei.aspx|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: he is looking for entry to N hand..so @DA|pg||
nt|bobholl: thinking at the rigth moment|pg||
pc|hK|nt|noodle:  nowadays many pairs use a jump to 4@c to show a big balanced raise and leave room|pg||
nt|mwigor: (interestingly?) all bloom's pickups have come when VUL - while milne's have been non-vul|pg||
nt|noodle:  yes juniors generally bid anything thAT moves|pg||
nt|mwigor: obviously vul is a factor when making decisions|pg||

nt|ahollan1: seems soft letting EW play 4@H|pg||
nt|noodle:  3@h p 4@h ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the double digit swings are going to MIlne, but the sngle digit swings are going to Bloom more frequently|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: The Milne team have gone for a smoke break|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@H-4@H OK, followed by X, 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scary|pg||
nt|sybarra2: per spec:    all the newer players are giving new material for books:))|pg||
nt|lmeili: wd! Patrick though not as our expected way|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice find!  Confirming that NS don't use the intermediate response to 1@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: almost made but ....  |pg||
nt|sharkey: Likely make if N overcall 1 NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice push|pg||
nt|mwigor: the juniors survived this troublesome interference - perhaps blasting 4 or 5@h would have worked better?|pg||
nt|bobholl: true was (my) bad idea :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra2: and the 2 @C is precision 6 clubs could have 4 card major|pg||
nt|bobholl: their prempts get better :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I do't know why NOrth doesn't open his weak 2@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: folowed by a low@C leadfrom East, and a long think...|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  not the 1st 2@s over 2@h psych in the set. is it autralian standard ?|pg||
nt|mwigor: here the west hand didnt meet andy's requirements so he has the decision over what to do over partner's pre-empt when holding 5 card support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hand not quite good enough to bid 3@H  [@SQ worthless on the auction]|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  nothing under 5@h|pg||
nt|noodle:  hmm|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so when did CC start precision?  |pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to guess what S does (don't know what double can be )|pg||
nt|othered1: A classic looking Precision 2@C opener.   But in general it's a weak spot inthe system, especially since they usually don't have strict suit quality requirements for it.|pg||
nt|fifee: yes and 1@C .. 2M or 3m shows 8+ and 4441|pg||
nt|sharkey: On that particular hand wud have helped declarer|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  3N |pg||

nt|bobholl: guess so but aceless not my cup of tea|pg||
pc|cA|nt|noodle:  he had a senior moment|pg||
nt|noodle:  maybe he s afrais E psyched lol|pg||
nt|mwigor: i'm not sure if anything works today - but taking away blackwood appeals to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now that Norh has volunteerd a bid, South must be dreaming of 7|pg||
nt|noodle:  very surprised at E pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of this championship match is  32|pg||
pc|c3|nt|noodle:  i really believ in going past 4N on these hands  who knows it could go 5@s P P P + 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually that's 64th board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C was 2+   and i think 1@D was 4+@H  [i know it is without DBL]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D length is just a coincidence|pg||
nt|sybarra2: in the 50's or 60's?|pg||
nt|fifee: first that I saw it was 60s. |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|noodle:  W had his rebid ready|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no fear 3NT from North|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and by South's tank|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have to find the @C switch otherwise 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahalim: A and a @C back will be 2 down|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H doesn't make either|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tejjyid: South suddenly feels his @SQ is not waste paper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious that Adam didn't open 2@D  -  is he TOO GOOD at this vul??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: must be - T 6th was enough 30 minutes ago|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 NT on a @D lead or switch ??|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: identical auction in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  again, not the type of hands the Noble team needs|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 4@H makes 3@S take care of the @D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  question here is how many overtricks|pg||
nt|gambit: CCmade Precsion mainstream |pg||
nt|sybarra2: 60's I think also|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mwigor: 7@h is a good save|pg||
nt|tejjyid: good cheap save for many imps|pg||
nt|mwigor: (double dummy this is the par contract)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: moment of truth|pg||
nt|noodle:  nice D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: rise the K, no-one switches from the Q here|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi PS|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - we noted - takeout x OR as well and EW going down at 4@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: For example, it can be a 5-card suit of other than outstanding quality|pg||
nt|fifee: reserving 1@C 3M for the 4-7 hcp with 7 card suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but now 3NT makes too :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fifee: Howard Schenken invented a strong club system in the early 60s before Wei precision became mainstream|pg||
nt|gambit: with Sontag, weichsel and  all those young players|pg||
nt|gambit: Indeed |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mwigor: -4 is -800 but 12 IMPs to Milne who will lead by 1|pg||
nt|noodle:  I think the 7 level is justified by possession of both red 7s  might get a free beer out of it|pg||
nt|bobholl: will make now if he doen't finesse @C|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: which red finesse to take ?|pg||
nt|panja: small @D to Q?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|panja: in any case, you will get only 3 @D tricks..so might as well forgo the finesses|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: but how to get to w ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: so this is best|pg||
nt|panja: and if the play @H after Clubs...you will make 8 tricks..|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this surely looks more like 2@D opener than  24|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yep|pg||
nt|tejjyid: great work|pg||
nt|bobholl: doesn't|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tejjyid: I thought the @D9 might say "@S J"|pg||
nt|lmeili: EW is the best female pairs in Taiwan, but they open light most of time|pg||
pc|c9|nt|noodle:  I see some specs remember their junior daYs|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East is on a different page|pg||
nt|othered1: And Schenken's Club was just a modification of Vanderbilt Club.  Neopolitan, and it's successor, Blue Team Club, also preceeded Precision |pg||
pc|d5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bobholl: well he did and will finesse @S for 2 down (may be :))|pg||
nt|bobholl: after taking 2@C may be even 3 down |pg||
nt|sybarra2: ever feel like beating head agst wall?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this feels like one of those times|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: N does not know about @DT..so he has to keep all Diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tejjyid: only with the aid of my walking stick|pg||
nt|othered1: Not at the bridge table :)|pg||

nt|sybarra2:  from a dear friend in specs:   i looked it up in the encyclopedia, in 1969 Taiwan (w P Huang) finished 2nde after Italy in the Bermuda Bowl using Precision|pg||
nt|othered1: And  the legendary Mr. Huang has had other major successes|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: remember there are 2 more 16-board sets remaining in the championship|pg||

nt|ahollan1: take my word for it  ---  that is nice support for partner|pg||
nt|tejjyid: prima facie evidence that partner has psyched :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: IMo 1NT here does not promise a stopper|pg||
nt|fifee: Patrick is ranked 302 in the world. accomplishments can be found athttp://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=18230|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I thought we would hear 4 |pg||
nt|othered1: I think 3@S is the rational maximum.  Precision 1@C bids can be weak enough that it may be your hand and even 3@S can make partner misjudge, since a fit may not be needed to make ...|pg||
nt|othered1: game.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=18230|pg||
nt|panja: right..and after hearing the 1@S bid, N will be discouraged from bidding high|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if the k of @C is K of @S no chance so ...|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H makes because S has no wasted @S values|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW made 4@H on Bd 11 OR despite N making a takeout x....|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: sure, but we still had beer!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: blast into Ace Ask?   Splinter then Ask??   ART Game Force -- all make sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@s good contract for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ART Game Force Raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction is the one that used to have universal default where DBL=exactly 4@S   now it can be  4+@S, 4/5@S, less than 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and then you have pard who raises,...|pg||
nt|fifee: ty shirl|pg||
nt|lmeili: why not 1N?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or double|pg||
nt|sybarra2: think xx is honor + in clubs?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lmeili: passed hand 1N shows another 2 unbid suits, most players do|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps redouble shows Hx?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|noodle:  true lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not on same page|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Can't balme SOuth for biding 5 with all that shape. North's three key cards must be looking pretty good to him|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3 small @H, maybe pd is void....|pg||
nt|noodle:  except 4@d is not slammish as a rule|pg||
nt|tejjyid: agreed; but he may talk himself into it|pg||
nt|noodle:  i m floored at 4333 yarborough 5 level bid red|pg||
nt|noodle:  might be a big winner here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very attacking bid|pg||
nt|noodle:  he had a junior moment :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: DOn't forget, North is probably feeling a bit sick about going down in 4@S on the misguess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still thinking?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N just shows Strong NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: flexibility is good, right?|pg||
nt|bobholl: w doesn't like to be robbed :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tejjyid: interesting problem for North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been nice to hear about opener's singleton @H|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that Mr. Huang followed his silver medal in 1969 with another in 1970|pg||
nt|fifee: 5@C says I respect 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Gong,  is thinking "I am out of this hand"|pg||
nt|othered1: NS is heading to an ugly @S contract, but with EW cold for 3n would have been a fair price to play.  |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think 2@D understates the hand, but I admint @C K doesn't llok great|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for a quick coffee|pg||
nt|lmeili: Double may not show 5-5|pg||
nt|lmeili: but i will double|pg||
nt|bobholl: patrick will pass (iwould :))|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  aggressive opener by E made it easy to get to|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW make 6@D on finesse in @S and @D.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (odd 5@D bid)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S and 5@D are both a mystery to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Whibley thinking 3@C was less than game force.  That would explain 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: how about - 4@S = @C spport & @S Ace; 5@D = 3 @C ACes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@D ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could fit Andrew|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hope not - it was an effort to make that up, I wouldn't advocate playing it!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: n/s might be surprise at their spade suit|pg||
nt|othered1: frigid 22 HCP 3N, a potential imp picker upper|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  and all the dreamers are talking about 6@s or 6@d... I'd be happy to get to game with the E hand:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: there's hope for noble in the other room, then|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is the type of hand that they can take a chance on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cashing at rubber bridge.:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  slam about 30-35%|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and they will know that time is runnin gout|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the results in the other room have been more boring than here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: anyway, he does have a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunately -- convention cards don't require explanation of how pairs play the sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regarding the DBL|pg||
nt|othered1: That may hold it to 4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: yes, have to ask|pg||
nt|fifee: tap tap tap and declarer will lose control|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still, I think with 6 ard @D, you cna try 3@D here|pg||
nt|noodle:  after the pass maybe 3@d ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, you have limited your hand already over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh another guess --- 5@D is operator error and should be 5@H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll have to wait for the book|pg||
nt|panja: N should have have bid 3@H that early|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  usually when you have a large number to catch up, you have to decide that one pair will play the boards even and the other will do the swinging.|pg||
nt|noodle:  pard knows you re under 10H and you didn t open a @D prempt|pg||
nt|panja: what was the hurry?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he is better than me (that i knew already)|pg||
nt|panja: note that W's first pass, followed by a live auction double does indicate @S values..|pg||
nt|bobholl: true that makes it easier |pg||
nt|panja: but S could hold @SQJxxx and @H xx..|pg||
nt|panja: so the 3@H bid is a rather risky bid...|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 9 of @D migth have helped too although that didn't matter|pg||
nt|lmeili: trump lead |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: just in from Liam    3@C is splinter in either minor, either weak or very strong|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: thanks Liam !!!|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess he respects it.  Of course, south has extra defense, enough that north couldn't double even though this is going down several|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: imp-gaining lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|panja: N could have passed, made E squirm a little..and taken a penalty if possible...|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: the other room is on the final board of the 2nd Quarter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Whibley will claim as soon as Nunn leads     we hope|pg||
nt|bobholl: in spite of @C lead still makeable 3 @D first|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with 7 HCP I hate to bid as if I have 0|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although in principle I'm for all conventions, they are time consuming|pg||
nt|bobholl: what good alternative did he have ? :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: they have to defend carefully |pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: easier to do that when you're at the table -- not so easy for us out in the ether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, true, I was on a slightly different wavelength|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 48 imps with 3 to play --- nice position for Milne|pg||
nt|tejjyid: good work by South|pg||
nt|noodle:  dare we predict a flat board ?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no predictions...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: sorry , 4H was made ,not over 1|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry forgot @H ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: only 3 to play in this room -- and NS appear to have a decent set going|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C still 2+|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and the  names will be entered shortly |pg||
nt|sybarra2: when operator has a moment|pg||
nt|othered1: This one figures to be quieter|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H now ?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|noodle:  E has another borderline opening|pg||
nt|bobholl: with a little help from my friends :) (the double)|pg||
nt|panja: I have to leave now, thx Bob, Chou, all, was a great session|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Thank you|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: Frankly, I would rather bid 2@S than 1@S on South's cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-22|pg||
nt|sybarra2: take a deep breath all,  we have reconnected to the other room |pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: will they get too high ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: tomorrow's final will also be  4 sets of 16 boards|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SOuth counting the @H in the deck|pg||
nt|sybarra2: like the 1 level|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally feel opening a flat 11 with weak NT shape, then bidding it like you have some distribution can place partner in an impossible position.|pg||
nt|othered1: But I'm in a tiny minority on that|pg||
nt|fifee: N should balance on pd's values|pg||
nt|lmeili: lebensl |pg||
nt|bobholl: exactly 9 tricks probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: May end here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: but having lucked out with my 1@S opening, I am going to raise here|pg||
nt|othered1: at imps ona 4-3-3-3?  May often trade a small plus for a small minus.|pg||
nt|fifee: Patrick will not hang pd with a jump here either, I predict|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mwigor: i understand your reluctance to bid 1|pg||
nt|mwigor: but 2 is gross|pg||
nt|bobholl: there you are|pg||
nt|bobholl: reached a fair contract X in N very dangerous (S jumping in @D)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|noodle:  anyone for pass ?|pg||
nt|noodle:  4 jacks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think "vile" captures it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3rde set was wild again|pg||
nt|lmeili: E may say double now|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: This is Chinese Taipei Open Team Trial - Final - Segment 2 / 8|pg||
nt|lmeili: she does'nt like to deffense 3@c |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pass is fine|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this can go a lot down|pg||
nt|othered1: And partner can get overboard, not to mention problems thatmight arise from a slow double|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobholl: small @D @C away so ..|pg||
nt|bobholl: how low can you go :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: winner of the event gets an invitation to and subsidy for the 2011 Yeh Bros event  |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... you may be right about percentage...i thought it would be a little higher because of lead, etc....but @ds do have to be 2-2 if you are dropping stiff Q|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  EW probably anxious now to get with teammates to compare|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they look relaxed|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s can still be made|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both North players bid 1N  --  i wish i knew wheter it was ostensibly Strong NT  or minors|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the names of teams are reversed originally, and nothing we can do |pg||
nt|sybarra2: next set sorted out |pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Open  room has finished , and we have 2 bds to go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And restart in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2.5 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: :)|pg||
nt|lmeili: brb|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Wu ask Hu "What's lead from AQ?" Ans:"A"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Oops he asks "AK"|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Wu is looking at dummy seriously|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: I mean cards , not Patrick :P|pg||
nt|fifee: Patrick is experienced enough to count the hand and understand his pd's double|pg||
nt|bobholl: this is tricky if E has got the @C K migth get a promotion |pg||
nt|bobholl: and he knows 5@S and 5@D so finesse now ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobholl: they bid as ligth as meckwell but with less result :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: although a @C lead migth help to prevent 2 down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: I think Hans-Nunn are the only pair underleading I've seen all weekend|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: specs still talking/asking about  14 from last set when pair for Milne went for 1700 [against partscore, i think]|pg||
nt|lmeili: sounds 9 tricks, 4@s 2@c 1@d need 2 @h tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may as well continue @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: outcome decided now 46 imps|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lmeili: the best deffense should continue @d to kill dummy's entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Patrick leaves for toilet|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  now only 3... dbl dummy, j@s had to be played|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bobholl: so my 1st prediction of 9 tricks comes true :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: sadly, the server crashed for that specific hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: at this point -- he'll be happy with 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: back now|pg||
nt|lmeili: low @c or @cQ i think|pg||
nt|lmeili: in fact Patrick knew, E has 3-@s, 1@d, 5-6 @h so far|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra2: never hanging pard|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: counting it to be flat and an 8 count.  Guess he presumes that this west won't respond on 0 points, which most modern players would do.  An almost free psych.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|tejjyid: almost certainly strong in this case|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: The @S situation will also be clarified here as East doesnt ruff in|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: we just called it an "operation" in our room |pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|nt|noodle:  my style for overcalls : good hand or good suit  doesn t cut it for me|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tejjyid: looking at the hand record, it's a nonsense; the 5@H contract was in a 3-2 fit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lmeili: E will open 2@d if shw has both M 4-4+|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||
nt|sharkey: making 9 now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: but I have no idea of what really happened|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: Hans-Nunn the only ones i've seen leading Rusinow [underleading] vs BOTH Suit & NT, but i've seen others use it in just one situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit high this contract |pg||
pc|sK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s6|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Hung is playing 4@H from South|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: that really makes Ish's overtrick meaningless|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: indeed|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this 11 good enough for 1N?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK. I like it in all situations personally|pg||
nt|bobholl: N happy that he didn't give away the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: will reach and make 4@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mwigor: i think 2@s is stomach churning though|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: "precision" 1 @D just luck S has @D  |pg||
nt|bobholl: did i say reach 4@S ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: weak two or "muiderberg"?|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: good-o   i was hoping to see another 1@C opening|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Patrick finding this bid "interesting"|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will sit with X |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer my bad bids to take up lots of the opponents space|pg||
nt|noodle:  i strongly dislike 5332 preempts|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it really is is a poor 11|pg||
mb|2S|an|xfer to 2nt|nt|tejjyid: best not to over use them, I agree|pg||
nt|noodle:  they have worked badly for my pards (I don t use them)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S much better than 5@C but will go down too|pg||
nt|bobholl: trump lead against doubled partscore|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or not setting it enough?  |pg||
nt|sybarra2: 3 nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugrapha2: sniggering all round at the auction|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be bot that effective this time 4@H and 1@D sure now|pg||
nt|bobholl: not (not bot)|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C lead @D same result as open|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  another no substance hand... Ish hoping his pass would attract some action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the specs -- Ish could NOT RDBL to show points   it would show 4+@D  [transfers over 1@C and 1@C-DBL]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: learn more about the hand with PASS|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not often this pair will be in a partscorewith 24|pg||
nt|othered1: Here, south has to take his life in his hands and rebid that suit, just to get his real suit exposed.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D forcing Stayman I presume|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess showing 4144|pg||
nt|bobholl: stops @H lead may be |pg||
mb|3D!|an|4-1-4-4 |nt|andyv:  but he could have bid 3N immediately|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and he probably wouldn't want to double to show points|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Does anyone feel that you can have more success preempting ambiguous openings, like the Precision 1@D, than the big @C opening?  I do, and it applies to other ambiguous openings, ...|pg||
nt|othered1: like canape.|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be first 3@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Where are they headed?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: but not 3 down on @C now migth even make :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: taking a long time ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: impressive stop|pg||
nt|fifee: or multi or tartan|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I plyed with a master of 4 card pre-empts, so I was always relieved when he had a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is unexpected|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: west didn't know where to go :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  I agree with his pass at this stage of match... you need to try to create something... otherwise I'd just bid 3N and get it over before opps can communicate.|pg||
nt|mwigor: edgtton also overcalled 1@s in the other room (on 14)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: excellent auction|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|bobholl: everyone now gets squeezed guess 1 down now|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes 1 down|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think it's probably modern standard|pg||
nt|ritong: they should be allowed to score +131|pg||
nt|othered1: against multi, usually a weak bid, there are different considerations and adages like not preempting over preempts may take precedence|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice investigation and stop by EW|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: also 3 down i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: east is hoping to elope with as many trumps as possible, I guess. not necessarily a bad strategy|pg||
nt|fifee: nice cross ruff established here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fifee: the strength of using multi is to allow weak 2 suiter opening bids|pg||
nt|fifee: possibly 500|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like east is heading for -2 pretty much regardless the defense unless they err|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|noodle:  i see 1 ace and 10 losers|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer my weak 1 level overcalls to have playing strength (shape)|pg||
nt|bobholl: patrick thinking :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: i cannot rebound on your idea, ed, because to me preempts are descriptive bids|pg||
pc|s4|nt|noodle:  13 if i add opps and pard lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'll bet Tony wondered for a second about 3N South|pg||
nt|bobholl: N getting kind of squeezed|pg||
nt|sharkey: S doesnt know od has @HJ so may not cash out|pg||
nt|sharkey: *pd|pg||
nt|sharkey: North's thinking may place hime with @HJ??|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: in 3N  Andy Hung must not have attacked @D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this will be another significant small gain to Bloom|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems there should be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fifee: oops|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fifee: @CA would have made the cheese binding|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: 4@H went down on  30  some token imps for Noble|pg||

nt|bobholl: did i say C ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@H can go off on @C lead,ruff  and small @D return.|pg||
nt|mwigor: no this one is systemic i think|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@d = @h, 1@h = @s, 1@s = @d|pg||
nt|sybarra2: sorry that was PAT |pg||
nt|fifee: ty all @H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: dont let my fingers do the walking tonight |pg||
nt|othered1: rounded 10s are well-positioned here for Gong.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Congratulation to WeiDe :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: K of @H and not made yet|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: he hasn't got his 9th trick yet but 5@D will cause troble|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: trouble|pg||
pc|h2|nt|noodle:  transfers is ok but alert might have been missed|pg||
nt|othered1: Inthe OR, it's not beyond belief that south might have found the killing lead onthe auction, since east didn't really show a NT hand.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|noodle:  I really like transfers over take out doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: Thanks all now|pg||
nt|bobholl: but difficult to defend anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzzq: there will be last segment tonight|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: bye|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: surprised East idn't play @D first|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he needs a 9th trick even if the @C come home & "steal early"|pg||
nt|mwigor: this will be a disappointing result for the kids - martin may not play again if the match is close|pg||
nt|noodle:  and there is a case for finessing @c after take out double|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tejjyid: a BIG case|pg||
nt|bobholl: west must have both aces for his opening i would guess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: most of Milne team was 2nd in 2010 NOT and Spring NOT  -- they're going to have to find new gear to break that streak|pg||
nt|tejjyid: HAns will make thesame 10 tricks - actually, maybe a differnet 10 tricks, but it will score the same way|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have another half to go,    |pg||
nt|sybarra: not over yet|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, Milne had a MASSIVE third set yesterday, 84-11, sostand by after the break|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|s9|nt|othered1: 4-1 @D split makes this 6-in, 6-out on any lead|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mwigor: they would have been hoping for a lead|pg||
nt|noodle:  is 1 of 4 segments enough in the event ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mwigor: it depends on his goal|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx all for watching|pg||
nt|lmeili: come back soon for next |pg||
