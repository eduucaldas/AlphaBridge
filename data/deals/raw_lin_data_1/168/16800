mb|2S|nt|ady: chance for Ireland to recoup some imps     6@H  on heart position|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dburn: and if anyone's going to bid a slam, you'd put your money on West|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|dburn: trouble is, of coruse, that in these days of RKCB you can't bid a slam on the trump finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: since that missing trump king might instead be a real ace|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|mamos: though wont make much difference here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @H person, since hand not strong enough for true reverse|pg||
nt|mamos: If you open 1@d it sometimes gets hard to show Hearts|pg||
nt|toobad: Jacoby is a good start|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jbgood: Hauge seem to have recovered after 2 losses and make a challenge if Gillis lose by let us say 11-19.|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hard to see this ending up in anything other than 4 @H, making, or possibly 3 NT|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@c shows shortage|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C shortness I assume |pg||
nt|mamos: they may bid this now|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|toobad: no hurry, quite rightly|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|nt|sybarra: serious 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: i wonder what 3@h means|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the cue bids go on |pg||
mb|4N|nt|nicksan: I wonder if a trump lead from South could break it? This, however, won't do it.|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 2 @c was @ds, perhaps W just showed his distribution?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: i think a trump beats it Nick|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the last board of this weekend, and some thanks are due.  Thank you operator operator Hrafnhildur, for your tireless efforts during these days. Well done indeed! And thanks ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: to sponsor Iceland Express and Bridgesamband Íslands (Ólöf),  for making it possible for us to watch the this exciting bridge live.  And of course thanks to BBO and Roland Wald.|pg||
nt|nicksan: yes, think so. E/W getting rewarded here for not mentioning the Clubs in the bidding|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: its the shape of W hand that has not been made clear to E|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: Also thank you Nick Sandqvist (who has been here all the time) and all the other commentators who have provided us with expert opinions and analyses. |pg||

nt|toobad: oops|pg||
nt|mamos: two key cards missing|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam needs the k of @H on side or dropping |pg||
nt|toobad: clearly v steady players. a reasonable auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Keri (N) thinking she has 2 tricks|pg||
