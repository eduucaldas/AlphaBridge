nt|mamos: have you got an envelope handy David?|pg||
nt|dburn: though certainly you should not neglect the extra chance in diamonds, so not a "true" five or seven hand|pg||

nt|Walddk5: After this round there will be a long break for dinner. Restart at 20.00 local time, in about 3 hours and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have a lot of high cards but poor shape and two top @d losers|pg||
nt|mamos: bet you didnt expect @d9 to win last trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability is going to make this board less interesting than it might|pg||
nt|dburn: one thing about these players - they have a refreshing attitude towards getting on with the game|pg||
nt|idc: v 4@h North needs to switch to @d at trick 2, continued @c in OR and declarer had 10|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - we should be finished in time to watch the highlights of the 1st world cup game|pg||
nt|toobad: no time penalties!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toobad: sounds good Guthi|pg||
nt|idc: A point of technique on this hand:|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT agrees spades|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|idc: in 4@s on say trump or @h or @c lead: draw trump, eliminate side suits finishing in dummy|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  card also says that 2NT shows slam interest - maybe West thought he was not good enough |pg||
nt|idc: then a @d to Q and claim - South endplayed even if they began with AK @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  true - but most of the time South has dxA-K he will lead one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dA-K|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|idc: Of course, they might have led one from @dAK, but no reason not to play it properly :)|pg||

pc|c3|nt|idc: Many players go through this stage in their bridge careers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is hoping for a 6th @s but optimistic even then|pg||
nt|idc: Lose patience on potential slam hand and use Blackwood |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West should have responded 2NT and so not felt the need to take control later|pg||
nt|dburn: chance for Northern Ireland - right defence not all that far-fetched|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: Yes, the 2@c bid left them stuck a little over 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: West is worth no more than a "sound raise " to 4@S  some pairs play 3NT shows this sort of hand as  response to 1M|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  three rounds of clubs at other table too|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about that @c8 - seemed to be a half-way house between shwoing count and discouraging|pg||

nt|idc: In the other room, SOuth led @s2 v 3NT, and North put in @s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only 8 tricks in view (and that is with @h 3-3)|pg||
nt|idc: so the 10 won trick one|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Any thoughts on North's dbl?   I quite like it opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yorkbeach:  the right shape certianly|pg||
nt|dburn: don't mind it at these colours, but might tip declarer to a line he would not otherwise find|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it's a bidders' game, and North-South certainly play it that way|pg||
nt|mamos: might misplace @SK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: The English EW  are both experienced and perhaps less "excitable" than many JUniors  Id expect a reasonably steady performance from them|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes = declarer needs to duck the 1st @s really|pg||
pc|d2|nt|toobad: should be 2 off |pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  South dozing|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|yorkbeach:  double dummy I can see how to make it: knock out the @hA, cash @h/@c winners and exit with 3rd @d|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - declarer wasn't going to run the four, although he would have made some kind of history if he had|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: A guess declarer may be able to put pressure on North, who is holding most of the defensive values|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is leading twice towards the hearts in case North has A-x|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to duck a spade to North to keep an entry|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|idc: All eggs in 3-3 @c split basket, not that I can blame West for that|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  N needed to play more quickly here|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a kind of three-suit strip squeeze without the count|pg||
nt|idc: yes, when you are going to be under pressure best to plan early so you can make crucial discard smoothly|pg||
nt|dburn: and one of these days, I expect to see a full discussion of the topic by Julian Pottage|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn: come to that, can they beat four hearts?|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: no doubles alertable in Scotland...|pg||
nt|idc: may also think North has an accept :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not "on top" - suppose East led his singleton spade against 6@h|pg||
nt|idc: even the 3rd best slam, 6@s, should be ok|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the best contract is six hearts by South, but that might be a bit difficult to organise|pg||
mb|4N|nt|yorkbeach:  @h lead best as cards lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but West may score a @c ruff to make up the club trick lost on the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: @CQ   is an interesting lead|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the -2 in OR came when South didn't have trump control to set up a long club trick|pg||
nt|dburn: he may, but this lead may also have lost a tempo - declarer would have problems keeping control on a heart lead|pg||
nt|mamos: (is fearless the code?)|pg||
nt|idc: whereas this lead should give him that, so perhaps -2 for a flat board|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|mamos: @cQ would have worked better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: make a lot of tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: played by North, this might be closer to a five or seven deal than the previous candidate|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that West did not double 5@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is trying to work out whether 6@c shows no kings or the @cK?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|idc: good catch - I suspect that he was asleep (understandably given the hour)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 5NT asks for Kings  odd time for \south to be thinking|pg||
nt|toobad: i think they are all just v tired|pg||
nt|toobad: 7 now!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  given how quickly they play, it would have been possible to arrange the schedule for an earlier finish |pg||
nt|dburn: seven? if North believes South's bidding, she should bid at least eight|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and ew will almost certainly bid 3d|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamonds plays well for East  -- and a heck of a lot better thaN @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not ridiculous to try for game with the South cards - those kings look well placed (though one of them isn't)|pg||

nt|mamos: sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East did well to read the lead|pg||

nt|idc: except for 'brilliance' you could be talking about any of my games|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|idc: Well, no UCB 2@d by partner, so it is a little pushy|pg||
nt|dburn: facing three trumps to the queen and clubs headed by A10 or K10, game would have reasonable play|pg||
nt|dburn: so trying for game is only mildly fearless|pg||

nt|dburn: I suppose you could implement a system like they have in tennis - three undos per set|pg||
mb|1D|nt|toobad: slam not easy on a h lead|pg||
nt|dburn: rather less bidding than one might expect at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: i wonder if declarer thought about those little Hearts  5 was lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed but good fun to play|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wales did well there|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont agree with either of those two calls|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed they did, and who knows - playing penalty doubles of 1@h might work well for them here also|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  not a fan of canape openings either |pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: explained as Jump fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 1NT or pass are reasonable for East but not double|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: dont agree with x|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what will s do if n bids 3h|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont mind canape openings in some situations but thats a really good six card suit and a hopeless five card one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this has no chance|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 4@H is  /&%¤ !!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 5@H is ............................|pg||
nt|dburn: no doubt North thought South's 3@d implied a heart fit|pg||
nt|dburn: and still thinks so|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: got a little out of control....|pg||
nt|dburn: Robson and Segal's book ought not to be allowed to be read by people under 25|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East might find a double here but is trying to avoid doing with with undue haste|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: N thinks jump fit...|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|idc: tennis is a dangerous game for bridge to ape: Brits never win anything|pg||

nt|dburn: and not very many people over it, either|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mamos: East probably checking the colour of the backs of her cards|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|idc: Does someone want to mention Burn's Law here?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|s7|nt|dburn: still, I suppose South does have a sort of fit jump - he has 4-4 in the red suits; the trouble is that both red suits are diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|jcomyn: u most certainly do and i agree a lot of senior players x|pg||

pc|hK|pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: the we didnt come herer to pass brikgade|pg||
nt|toobad: or they bid a filthy 2c lol|pg||
nt|mamos: I do think double is completely wrong  - Pass is fine  - even 2@C  but double will shows 4 Hearts in my (humble!!) opinion  and more Diamonds and just asks for trouble|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is heading to a nasty score for ireland|pg||
nt|mamos: I bet  NOrth wishes hed bid the filthy 2@C  then he'd be playing it rather than North in a filthy 3@d|pg||
nt|toobad: as the cards ly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i couldnt agree more about a x of spades. it MUST show hearts|pg||

nt|jcomyn: an aul 3nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: Sandra Claridge representing BGB and the SBU (match manager Fiona Abbott)|pg||
nt|idc: Another fun one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I can see that a partnership between Marc Smith and David is not about to happen - Marc loves raising with three|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 11 and 12 have yet to be scored, and Northern Ireland have about 20 IMPs worth of plus positions in those|pg||
nt|idc: Some Easts may feel they are too good for a 3@c rebid, so some will get to a game|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  last board here|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this may temper East's enthusiasm|pg||
nt|idc: Last board today.   Thanks to Stephen Peterkin, our Vugraph operator,|pg||
mb|2S|nt|idc: for allowing us to bring you the vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|toobad: will N bid 2S?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hope EW do not have the misunderstaning about whether this is a fit jump that we saw earlier|pg||
nt|idc: BGB and their representative Sandra Claridge and Fiona Abbott the Match|pg||
mb|3N|nt|idc: and as always, BBO itself and you specs for turning up and putting up with myself & fellow commentators|pg||
nt|dburn: is that forcing?|pg||

nt|mamos: why didnt she just bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|idc: I trust it will also be enough time for the two npcs in this match to return from medical treatment|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  wish I knew|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: but it has made for an exciting match for us watching|pg||
nt|dburn: pity, really. See you in a little while.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I can understand her way of thinking. Two empty suits, she was scared of notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it must be frustrating for the npcs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they see what the piars can do in practice matches but when it comes to the real thing...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are very inexperienced and playing in front of 500+ specs is pressure|pg||
nt|dburn: good grief|pg||
nt|idc: Manager for the Scottish Bridge Union for letting us cover the event.|pg||
nt|idc: And to my fellow commentators, David, Julian and Mike.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: E unsure about 2@H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: mind you, it might make - South leads a spade, North plays the king, East drops @cQ, etc|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure how they will defeat this|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to get to dummy to get the @c wrong|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: Tom's @HK  was certainly helpful|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  with diamonds 3-2 and the king onside, this has play|pg||
nt|mamos: @DK onside but 4-1 trumps will be too much|pg||

nt|dburn: but this is something of a bull-at-a-gate line of play, and I don't think it will work|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Stayman is not a good start|pg||
nt|jtr: In particular Sandra Claridge (BBO representative) and Fiona Abbott (match manager)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|jtr: Finall thanks to Anne, Ed for their company and Roland for his incrdible efforts in organising us for this hectic weekend of Bridge|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A luxury break of 1.5 hours before our next live broadcast, from Chinese Taipei|pg||
mc|12|nt|jtr: south did well not to double 2@c here|pg||
nt|jtr: Might make it easier to get to slam|pg||
nt|toobad: 6s 4h 3d ..... i dont think so|pg||
nt|jtr: Again Gerber gets a flat board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT  2@H  ;  2@S  4@C  (splinter) would be a fine start|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe i should take it up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then West's hand is enormous|pg||
nt|jtr: Or maybe it was a self-agreeing splinter at the other table|pg||
pg||

nt|mamos: declarer will be happy to get her seven tricks and get under way|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all to Session 4 of the Junior Camrose 2011|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: 1 2 3 or 4 Spades all possible I guess :)|pg||
nt|idc: this was making if declarer hadn't played a round of trumps before @h ruffs, wasn't it?|pg||
nt|toobad: v charitable David|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I thought so|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure - it was all over before I'd had a look at the position after trick three|pg||
nt|mamos: certainly had chances  if trumps handled differently|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a better slam this time|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll see|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: you should volunteer for coaching John and slow them down dramatically!!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: oh no not overcal;l vul on that garbage|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  we might have another splinter sequence|pg||
mb|2S|nt|toobad: its the style!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: if East plays auto-splinters, that would be a very good description|pg||
nt|toobad: some start ........... first 2 boards|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jcomyn: he wasnever taught that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with his Dad, Jonny Richards is playing them I am sure|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|idc: If that's a weak 2, I doubt I'd do anything but pass as East|pg||
nt|idc: Hi Julian|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Nice Maior he has|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Becky must have seen how well the cards lie!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (sorry)|pg||
nt|mamos: and 3NT is not a good idea  (even if it makes)|pg||
nt|idc: Naughty step for you Roland if we have any more of those puns|pg||
nt|idc: The cards certainly do lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s is weak but max is 11|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wales have a complete dearth of juniors such that they have had to make an U25 side out of their U25s and U20s. Accordingly, no Wales in the Peggy Bayer (U20)|pg||
nt|idc: That explains the enquiry from East then|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am not sure whether this pair could play in U20s|pg||
nt|idc: for many Juniors, an 11 count is an average strength 1 opening :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Harris-Richards could play U20s this year|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  for results|pg||
nt|idc: I guess West is thinking of coming again, holding 6-4 shape|pg||
nt|idc: looks like both 4@s and 5@d are making too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think it must be a connection problem|pg||
nt|idc: I used to have partners with connection problems - between their bids and their actual hands|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West may have been thinking but not this long|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mamos: Im afraid that Juniors learn from their olders and not betters :)|pg||
nt|toobad: i'm coaching for Lady Milne and one of them overcalled a worse suit than that 2 weeks ago|pg||
nt|dburn: is his Dad allowed to play in the Junior Camrose?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  With a full 15 HCP outside of clubs, West should insist on a slam|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mamos: I like East's 3NT  bid  good practical no nonsense bridge |pg||
nt|jcomyn: well i can tell you the irish coach will choke him for doing that|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  no but Simon Richards is playing in the WBU team in the Camrose|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|idc: I wonder what the 5@s response shows?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: E looking puzzled...|pg||
nt|toobad: me too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East is a little mystifed as he is looking at the @sQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  West is presumably trying to show extras|pg||
nt|idc: indeed, I expect West has shown the @sQ and East is wondering if two Queens of @s will threaten slam|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|idc: You may have heard the expression "duplication of values" - I guess both E & W having @sQ counts as that|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps he was not sure of the percentage play with @sAQ109xx facing @sQxx|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: rehi all|pg||
nt|toobad: confidence shaken after first board, i think|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West should have done the asking|pg||
nt|idc: expect so; we've all been there|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|toobad: long day |pg||
mc|12|nt|dburn: but I expect West just got confused; pity, because then so did East|pg||
