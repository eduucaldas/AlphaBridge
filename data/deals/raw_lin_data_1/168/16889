nt|bvdahl: I think I agree that 4@h is probably best in the long run...|pg||
nt|iceking: yes and you usually make overtrick so given that 3@H has to be underbid|pg||
nt|jillan:  Will he upgrade this to 8 points|pg||
nt|jcwla: Was dead to rights on beating 4@C but 4@D not so much, whatevah...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and we have 2 more boards of today's schedule|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5@d against 5@h?|pg||
nt|garnetts: tight match |pg||
nt|stewball: this is another example of the inefficiency of a 2nt opening..I've always thought that its the hardest opener to deal with in standard|pg||
nt|jcwla: Has S fully shown this hand?  Or did it take some mention of @D by N for S to know just how great it was?|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 9@C from E would have been better|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: maximim weak pass by north|pg||
nt|jcwla: I guess if 8-card suits are almost always trump then 9-card suits must always be trump.|pg||
nt|bobholl: this should be no problem ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  2 next boards, we'll compare the scores, but please disregards the results - it's pair event with IMPs scoring across the field|pg||
nt|rmb1: Roland would be proud of 6@D here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: The @DQ the key here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, NS have all the power, but may overboard well|pg||
nt|kjadams: likely would not have affected the final result, but a low spade lead rather than the Jack and our declarer might be still playing the hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: last 2 boards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the gap between 1st and 2nd place is narrowing, but Gawrys-Tuszynski are still 10 IMPs ahead |pg||
mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  in @s game, NS have to guess @d right|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, Lauria-Versace bid 3NT and made 11 tricks after @s lead from E|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as Polish spec pointed out, interview with Piort Gawrys appeared in the main daily paper of Poland on 18th-Feb|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lot of photos, interesting questions |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  yes, they are 26-34 as for now |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r7.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: no puppet here|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why a @s lead at trick one would have put a lot of pressure on S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: declarer should win the race to 7 tricks here.|pg||
nt|stewball: Lauria chose 1@h in the OR--I;m with him|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and for all specs who keep telling me in the polish club the rebid of 2@h would show 6, need to look at Krzysztof Jassem's book on the Polish club:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jillan:  the 2@S opening bid shows 0-7 and 5+@S is this to strong|pg||
nt|ybob: Q@D and @C finesse to 8 tricks, M lead was down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  unexpected end of auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: this might keep them out of slam?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have to be sure they have no 2 losers in @s now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|iceking: this is makeable looking at all hands|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess 2NT is the other room was natural, many would play it as artificial: scramble (or lebensohl)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W was really lucky to find @cK in partner's very few points|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: 2@C some Gazzili type bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmm  They both did well to keep low |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W was on th right track|pg||
nt|hedyg: N has no @s stopper and S doesnt like his K@S anymore|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  same start. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W's @s holding is not bold enough, IMHO, to convert passed partner's dbl into penalty|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S would hardly make the contract, but @d game by EW is missed|pg||
nt|hedyg: so lets try to play in @c.......|pg||
nt|hedyg: Tuszynski has a stick|pg||
nt|hedyg: this board will cost EW some|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcwla: Identical auction.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bobholl: you have to be very sure that 4@C isn't a cue |pg||
nt|hedyg: E could have come in over 1NT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  7th trick had been stolen|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  his first good move was to bid 4@h|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Lauria misguessed @DQ OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: The old adage of the Q behind the J......|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  bad news|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so the result|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass over 3@s X denied stopper|pg||
nt|kjadams: The Imp comparisons you see in Movie show vs the Open room, but this is an IMP Pairs competition scored across 8 tables.|pg||
nt|kjadams: again, the nice trump spots will simplify the play.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bessi2: indeed Sælensminde lead a @h vs 2N but followed low when Lauria played towards the Q of @d|pg||
nt|rmb1: At some stage West will have to play another @H to get his ruff|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  as for now, tha matter of course follows the same way as next door|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  trump return?|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has a chance to go wrong - dont know pd has @SK...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  both red suits don't look promising for lead |pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW dont have a good round so far...|pg||
nt|bobholl: will put J|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  may be, only 4@h from S show negative and 4@c - cue with some values in @s, whereas rdbl - 1st class comtril in @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *control, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was a slam invite in @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: would probably not bid 4@c without at least the K@S or a singleton|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: since N denied control|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in OR, W got @h A and cashed @d K to receive a signal from partner. E must have been discouraged @d and W hoped to beat contract with @s continuation|pg||
nt|hedyg: cross ruff for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  now, for instance|pg||
nt|rmb1: Getting urgent :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer has to find @hQ to win, but who cares now...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: east, of course, wasn't looking at 52 cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looking at dummy's @D suit a @D return wudnt be likely anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  exactly. now it's up to N|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  same position appears here|pg||
nt|toobad: We shall try again|pg||
mc|8|nt|iceking: he had to do something, his line seems fine to me |pg||
nt|iceking: didnt really have any suit to go for, no spot cards anywere|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|iceking: Not clear for north what is best now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  simple matter of guessing correctly|pg||
nt|sharkey: All going their way will probably finesse the "right" way|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in the  7, EW made 3nt after !Q lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@C in both rooms was a sort of relay (Gazzilli) and 2@S showed less then 8 points |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  right moment to let contract making|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last chance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W hardly expect partner to have 6-card suit|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think that the problem was: after redouble with better hand (maximum of negative 0-8) bid immediately, or pass, and bid in the next round|pg||

mb|d|nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=3427  stilling efter 4 runder|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt was weak with minor |pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry for Danish, I am sure you can figure it out|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thinki that is standing after 4 rounds|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|Walddk4: and good evening to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's a very aggressive double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is there a prize?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wd :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: club lead needed to beat 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  so here we are, now we just have to make it....|pg||
nt|chick: 2N is certainly a forcing raise and 4@S says nothing extra|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, was trying to locate William and typed you in by accident:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Peter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Peter!|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy hand to declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: too bad the hands ae so weak in n/s |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: still time to switch |pg||
nt|lml: South didnt want to lead from anything into the strong hand|pg||
nt|lml: which is good and bad when you are trying to set 1NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or maybe not..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  is it aggressive or just highly optomistic?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Peking need to claw back into this match |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Mike, would you double 1 club with the west hand?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jillan:  East doesn't really have a good lead.|pg||
nt|chick: that lead will help a lot, giving a pitch for a red loser|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can make with correct play. May not play a high @s from the hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: it's true, any lead gives a trick|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and after A@h what then?|pg||
nt|pelu: DD a @d|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe not A@h niow|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs an entry to @d if he finds that play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi all, what system are EW playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Some kind of swedish @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: weak bal or strong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, N can get spade ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think so|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnc: Welcome back to the broadcasting of the 12th Filbyter Cup, Round of 16. We are in the city of Linkoping (with approximately 150.000 inhabitants) at the east coast of Sweden, some ...|pg||
nt|rnc: 200 kilometres south of Stockholm. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@s for me |pg||
pc|s9|nt|rnc: Some words about the format of this tournament might be needed. Filbyter Cup is a handicap-based tournament. Every player in Sweden has a nation wide handicap, however based on all ...|pg||
nt|rnc: the pairs tournaments the player has played...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: with phantom opening bids, looks more like a forcing pass system|pg||
nt|xenya: no, 1@C can be 15+|pg||
nt|andyv:  our vugraph operator is William|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok spade now from S |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...I'm sure I would..|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wrong to duck!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|nigel_k:  Both probably, I was going for the most complimentary description I could think of|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnc: ...A team's hcp is calculated as the average of the players involved in the specific segment. The hcp-average for the two teams is compared and the difference then divided by 10, ...|pg||
nt|rnc: which gives us the number of IMP's per board the 'less skilled' team get as a bonus. As it is a KO-match, even a fraction of an IMP might be important at the end of the match...|pg||
nt|lestergold: a small @d to the T if won by south gets declare3r no where|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Trying|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi Mike :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: both pairs playing strong @c systems|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: heigh ho|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: that @D8 may actually prove to be an important card|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnc: All hcp-IMP's are included in the above shown standings.|pg||
nt|xenya: so 1@C is either a mini NT or a relatively strong hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, I am surprised to discover Peking is a district of Sweden|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Germ Kemper, his 2nd segment overall|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s will look at the hand and .....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mutter silently|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a wonderful explanation |pg||
nt|golfergolf: 1up|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: double is more flexible, I must agree|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: declarfer is going for the endplay|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 180|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nigel_k:  380 now I think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...so reckon this is a good score for NS|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here's a good example of the pitfalls of these two-way methods - was it 100% clear to West that East had the "mini"?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nigel_k:  Maybe not|pg||
nt|sybarra: the teams choose their names |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any bid that can be described as "flexible" always scores maximum marks in bidding competitions|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: we thought it was a team from China who got lost at the airport|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: playing in effect to limit his loss to 1 off if possible|pg||
nt|golfergolf: strong club, thank you |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I can't find a town called Zang inm y map of Sweden|pg||
nt|lml: this defence will work out fine to hold it to 2|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: hn north was better off playing a heart|pg||
nt|chick: that play won't work out well if E guesses to duck|pg||
nt|rnc: Convention card for E/W available at: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc11/fc_main_en.htm - then look under Convention Cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n not an easy contract to defend of course|pg||
nt|chick: S will be endplayed to give declarer one of the red jacks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And it points the way to how to play against them - get in early and as high as possible, as South did here|pg||
nt|andyv:  you were right|pg||
mc|7|nt|andyv:  pretty expensive duck by W|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  so, last board of the round|pg||
nt|jcwla: BTW it didn't come into play on this hand but if S gets to open this hand and it's in range for 1NT that is my choice.  You often hear "no need to bid 1NT when have a convenient @S ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: rebid" but so often it is not the case, you end up not able to show the hand.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  last board of this round|pg||

mb|2H|nt|sfoxa:  thanks to all the  specs for watching and providing with hints, great thanks to our operator, job well done!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N may well dream about @d small slam if partner has the right values|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess NS will reach 3NT (eventually) and make +3|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C very fine contract but diffcult to reach after multi|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in ca 25 minutes|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s by N...|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 4@c by S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be :)|pg||
nt|mareczek: multi 2@d weak two in a major|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: Big round for NS and Lauria-Versace struggling next door|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, NS managed to win 6@c after @h lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: fast board)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they both deserved having a breath :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  both pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: the next match starts soon|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye for now!|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 1@C simular to magic @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with such a superfit, EW have a lot of aces to concede |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if RDBL shows @d honour, NS here wouldn't  have their life as easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@s is on too |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is 6@s worse?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@S protects the K@H but is on a guess in @D plus @s finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is too final imo|pg||
nt|hedyg: or does it just mean no fit in @d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow Bessis has a great hand now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@S surely F so gives up on slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Does S hand deserves one more bid after "final" 4@s ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and one more round of today's schedule is coming soon, after short break|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next round after very short break, so stay tuned|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S hoped for his own play when bidding 1@s, not 2 |pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: thx everyone )|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty to Sveta and ty to our wonderful operator, Ivan Volozhenin|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa:  next round follows right now, so stay tuned|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  currently, NS are providing 40-20 and keep the lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: strikes me that 4@D now would sort this |pg||
nt|hedyg: surely yes, it is a great hand after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|mareczek: dbl of 3@h, what do you think should be?|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2N natural and 3H pass or correct.   3N preempts East from showing suit.|pg||
nt|mareczek: hearts or points?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: even the same |pg||
nt|stewball: Drijver judged to pass 2@c in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: aggressive 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  when EW will find sacrifice (very cheap this time), N would better assess his values and score small plus in 4@s dbld|pg||
nt|hedyg: they make it look so easy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: another fast arrival bid by Volcker|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D 32 is enough so no @D guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: or just trump 2@H |pg||
nt|hedyg: clearly N refused to cuebid anything else so Bessis should pass|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not easy contract at all. especially after @c lead threatening with ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are not scared|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be N should have tried a "natural" 6@C says spec but that isn't natural i fear |pg||
nt|hedyg: and surely would show 1st rd control in @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: true and with the single @D not attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Variations on a theme here.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm, not so S. definitely, no expecting partner with such @s values|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: Just been told that is Brink's birthday |pg||
nt|andyv:  thank yous to Sveta, Sudhir, Vladimir, Ivan our operator and to all the specs who joined us.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 1S generally promises a 5 card suit, and he has one.|pg||
nt|kjadams: just not spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 other pairs played in 2@s as well|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mareczek: I think that 2@s solved all problems of N|pg||
nt|mareczek: his problem now is 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Ns hand deserves one more move|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S can have at all valueless hand, kind of xxxx QJx xxx xxx - but only this case is really bad for N|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think that rdbl was "bid your suit" and 2@s promises some values in this case|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3@c must have been very precise with its meaning|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  kind of "maximal hand, both majors. @c values"|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the last board of the round, thanks to all involved in bringing us this event including my fellow commentator Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so N denies his dream|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H = fit in @s and 1st rd ctrl in @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  In OR, NS competed to 4@h and E took the save at 5@d|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ybob: 5@H defeat 500 with @D leads from S ( played by E) , hard to do|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  will N find @h lead?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thanks to our operator Ivan - half a job well done!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, declarer failed in 6@d trying one plan after another|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3nt may well go down after @h lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  I haven't seen yet how 6@d goes down.. it looks pretty easy to make|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All contracts look easy when you can see all four hands|pg||

pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  the only chance for defence|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Robin, welcome to the last board of the round|pg||
nt|garnetts: They did not get a Diamond lead against 6@C next door |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we'll have 3 more rounds after lunch break|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcwla: No way, this is cheap insurance time, nobody knows who is making what and they're not going to voluntarily allow a possible double swing.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  careful now! E has to play @c, not @d  in return|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next one is coming soon|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Expert's voice to hear! hi Mark|pg||
nt|sga1: NS haven't bid well here. S should make a bid with 4-4 in majors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  was N afraid of second DBL after 3@d?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:   let's add spices to this game! - Zaleski|pg||
nt|kjadams: double of 3H works when partner has 4H, but otherwise it just lets west in on the hand.|pg||
nt|mareczek: no nie|pg||
nt|mareczek: sorry, priv|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whatever you've agreed.  If haven't agreed, natural for now and we make the agreement after the hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I have to admit, bridge players in photos are just not that exciting.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jillan:  maybe S should have ducked that|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting defence here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: East has done well to go past 3NT, easily down on a heart lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: one played 2@c= , 1 went off in 2@H and 1 went off in 1NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rmb1: Next round at 14:30 CET (13:30 GMT) in 1 hour 40|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rmb1: Sorry.  I thought we had started the next round early :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nor here either |pg||
nt|mareczek: unlucky choice of Zmudzinski|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Mark|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bessi2: he must play a spade from dummy now if he want to avoid a guess|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is the last board of this segment.  Thanks to Roland, Ivan, John and Marek, and all kibs. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|mareczek: thanks a lot, bye :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good partner finds correct lead, very good one - finds one more trick in the suit |pg||
pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  idea about cashing @c ace seems better - if partner discourages, E has possibility to switch to @d|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|iceking: yes looks clear duck trick one |pg||
nt|jillan:  gives W entries to play @C from dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: in 2 @s all made overtricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bessi2: and now another diamond and declarer must guess|pg||
nt|ybob: was better play K@D and @S to hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. east must not ponder too long though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but N has to establish his @h trick or attack the @ds|pg||
nt|mareczek: but it is hard to imagine that opponents can have only 3 cards in one of majors|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: now he has a @D guess :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what for? LOL|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry K of @H is grown :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Sveta and Bob :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: see you all in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty Hedy, see you soon|pg||
nt|bobholl: tya cu later|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW are going to 6@d as well, imo. so we'll follow one more example of declarer play|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  current standing to be found here http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r8.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  cashing 2 more @s grants declarer with the contract|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|iceking: will just use it to play @C to Ten i assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's dbl of 3@h will get the defense off the the right lead against 6@d|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rmb1: spec says 3@C = max with both majors (2NT = min with both)|pg||
nt|mareczek: so the heart was sensible option|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jillan:  now I see why....'|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even this ruff doesn't prevent declarer from making|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - a push|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kjadams: down 1.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think they will make it|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The hand will turn on the play of the club suit|pg||
nt|kjadams: the trump lead here was the killer.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzyv: we will start next round in 1 hour 22 minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  see you. thanks to all|pg||
nt|kjadams: passing 2C was the winner on this hand.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: This is the last board of this round - 14 more rounds to follow.  We'll be back soon|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should admit, you joined the most interesting board of the round :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like the normal play|pg||
nt|andyv:  why Mark?  don't you ever finesse for 10s in slams?:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jillan:  normal result|pg||
nt|othered1: south m ade two odd plays there|pg||
nt|jillan:  10 or eleven tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lots more bridge on BBO today|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4H would likely make by north south, so not really a loss for Multi.|pg||
nt|mareczek: N nie musia³e mieæ czterech pików, adam mia³ ich sporo|pg||
nt|mareczek: sorry again|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: it did help him clear the @ss with just 1 loser|pg||
nt|kjadams: club misguess did not help|pg||
nt|daman: turn out the lights.....the party's over|pg||
nt|daman: and the fat lady is singing|pg||
nt|daman: running scores   http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: everybody is waiting for Gawrys to finish, all other tables are through|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  NS lost a bunch of imps, but can find consolation in retaining pair's moral. Leading partner's suit. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm check the scores here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Strange stuff here.  |pg||
nt|andyv:  I've seen NS have much better days...this was a rough set for them|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, thanks Sveta and Ivan and all kibs.  For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|kjadams: seeing all the hands makes North's problem hard to see, but the play of the club suit suggests different holdings for declarer than he actually has.|pg||
mc|8|nt|sfoxa:  from both side, I'd say |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thank you Jordan|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thanks to all the specs and special "bravo" to our operator - one should try this jib once to understand :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  see you tomorrow|pg||

nt|andyv:  3N about the max for NS on this hand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Are we sure it was nine tricks, I thought East could claim the rest at the end|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: you mean flexible in an ironic sort of way, then|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: but we suspect that, somehow, it is |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwe: 1NT is 0-6 hcp|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|golfergolf: OK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: another 1NT - just as well David Bird is not here|pg||
nt|lml: this one wont be quite so easy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: and this one not likely to be successful|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not really - the Bridge World panel use the word quite a lot though|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: it will need some help from the defense|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: club required, it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think that will be forthcoming|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump?!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If a trump, it should probably be the king ... but I don't think he will|pg||
nt|sybarra: and club is not easy from E is it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not when partner bid spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club switch for the setting trick will become obvious in due course|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: this does not look to be too much of a challenge |pg||
nt|sybarra: esp with this lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: hoi Germ |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|lml: declarer is just missing too many aces|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|andyv:  so board one was actually -380|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s6|nt|pelu: if 1NT 0-6 then W only car5ds to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Hi shirley and Mike|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: and tough to have 2 suited bid when S bids one of your suits|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The point of playing the king is that if declarer now ruffs clubs in dummy, one of them will be with the queen, promoting North's trumps back into play|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jillan:  no way this can make now. 3 spades and one H|pg||
nt|jillan:  IF the take them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: welcome|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well a diamond also ok, I suppose|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: declarer may wll be put to the @d guess on the second round of the suit too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wilkinsona: but south has gone wrong it seems|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|nt|nigel_k:  There aren't enough entries to set up and use the club suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  on this hand, with @ds, behaving, declarer has an easy route to 9 tricks and possibly 10 if he takes the @s hook|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But still nine tricks, or ten with the spade finesse|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: q of @D makes sense|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: N/S CC|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence slightly too busy here I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but nothign was really  obvious|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzwe: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/cc/sh-ta.pdf|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now  -3|pg||
nt|lml: from declarer's point of view the club finesse could work|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably playing udca|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: udca is standard in Sweden, as are 3rd/5th leads|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also against NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and declarer is feeling the pressure and has given up on further @d tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|chick: guess he should have cashed his diamonds for heart pitches before playing another trump|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: N may get endplayed here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs the club hook  for 7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra:  from a chinese friend:  peking,pe means north,and king means capital literally in chinese|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|nigel_k:  Remember that declarer doesn't know the diamond layout so is trying to obtain as much information as possible before tackling the suit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: taking the trump hook..|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Would the @SK switch have gained a trick I wonder?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always two club losers though|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: and the City "Norrköping" is what i have heard, sometimes called "Peking" even though its not in the north :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|jillan:  yup|pg||
nt|chick: in fact, that was so obvious, I'd love to hear his reason for not doing it|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|lml: he didnt even try it.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: Mach have a pretty good lead, but I see a great Zang score on 23 OR so maybe a close match yet|pg||

nt|vugraphzyv: Hello|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Polish experience vs. Dutch drive|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW may well land in 3NT having 25 points, but the mission of collecting 9 tricks may be impossible |pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d not everybodies choice|pg||
nt|kjadams: Gawrys/Tuszinski are leading,   Herbst/Herbst are 3rd|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have no CC for EW, sry|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|jcwla: 20-20 hand.  W has no call over 1@S.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW can hardly win the bidding, although... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let' see|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello to all - round 6 of Slava Cup is about to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nothing like a slam to start things off.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marek Wójcicki|pg||
nt|mareczek: hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marek, Roland, John, Ivan.|pg||
nt|andyv:  welcome all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  N showed @h and @c two-suiter and E seems to be happy to dbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: preempt over preempt|pg||
nt|kjadams: With one match to go, 1st is 30 VPs (Half a full match score) ahead of Lauria/Versace|pg||
nt|hedyg: they were vice european junior champions in ..1978? and until last year played rather rarely together|pg||
mb|3H|an|5+5+hö|nt|mareczek: Gromow Dubinin play strong club, Precision style|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for those who joined as today - this tournament consist of 2 groups, Top-16 and Top-40 |pg||
nt|andyv:  Ivan Volozhenin will be our operator|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are following the first one and current standing is here http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  low @s will net this contract|pg||
nt|sga1: 5@d seems to be makeable contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  W does not have an easy lead but the K@s would make the papers|pg||
nt|sga1: with low @s, even 3N will score|pg||
nt|hedyg: i love the 2NT by Gawrys protecting his Q@H! as well as the @s honours|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the runners-up - Lauria-Vercase are playing vs. Gromov-Dubinin - not an easy opps|pg||
nt|hedyg: by not opening 1@c his hand is limited|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: dont think S should upgrade his hand |pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brother play natural system with transfer responses after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|bobholl: could be 3NT NS|pg||
nt|hedyg: ( i am counting on our Polish specs to help me out )|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: south upgrades to 12, OK with 2.5 honor tricks, I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: hi to all|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N maybe an inquiry as to type of raise|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW are leaders now|pg||
nt|hedyg: there go the @d losers|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North might have doubled 4@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might have done a lot of things, like consider slam opposite AQ@H|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Depends on your preemptive style |pg||
nt|hedyg: except he has probably seen his pd's 3@H openings before|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes hi Mark :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow 4@D has not left him space to explore|pg||
nt|hedyg: results  and standings: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: very long think|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: make little sense to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT a challenge - 4@S better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, not a coffee-board for a start|pg||
nt|sharkey: nope - East may have overbid slightly - a little to good for 3@S over 3@H.  Needs to take @H finesse I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: West looking at @SQ and @HA....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brothers, sorry|pg||
nt|mareczek: they both use the same system :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  current standing is here http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm |pg||
nt|rmb1: Only nine tricks in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 5-3-3-2 shape bad suit cant see the reason|pg||
nt|jillan:  with a system as this I agree with Magnus|pg||
nt|jcwla: A false preference to 2@S would be better, perhaps those @H's looked like six to N.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the 3rd round of Slava Cup http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and current standing of Top-16 http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|kjadams: this missing heart Q will stop this at 6.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's a pairs event with IMPs scoring across the field, so the scores that appear should be considered indirectly|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to assess the size of his bad luck|pg||
nt|hedyg: great spots in @H|pg||
nt|kjadams: agree on the 2N.  Very nice call.  Right sides hand, and he can infer help in Hearts from auction.|pg||
nt|daman: it will be hard to defeat this one|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: well judged|pg||
nt|jillan:  would need at least another 10 LOL|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 1N was just generic point-showing, so south had to bid|pg||
nt|iceking: assume now S has shown 12-13hcp with 5@S |pg||
nt|mareczek: Dubinin assumed that partner does not have @dxxx|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N will have to find 4 discards on @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is his 9th trick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|iceking: N took a very good view stop now, i would be little bid interested in 3nt looking at his hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  getting fit, W will bid game|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can play the @hs himself for 2 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  EW did their best to win the bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. but even now, N can manage his tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S is clearly showing a spade shortage |pg||
nt|andyv:  slam a poor proposition |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at the tournament web-site, one can find the participants lists (quite impressive) and results for both groups - Top-16 and Top-40|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Brink-Driver won round 1 and are still doing well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not even a false preference in this case.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tournament is being played in 2 groups - Top 16 includes mostly international stars (Lauria-Versace, ex.)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Something of an overbid in my view|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and Top-40 - mainly Russian players, but with invited guests as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: must play @H before @D to get to the 2nd @H trick|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's better line than playing @c - when S comes on lead, he'll return @s|pg||
nt|kjadams: Diamond to dummy, heart to the T wins in North has the King.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: difficult decision now but anything is good|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|hedyg: hello :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Bob :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and hello to Yvan , our operator |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like organizers intended to provide each nation with BBO-starring opportunity here, whereas Open room is occupied by Lauria-Versace |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Sveta :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls dont send our specs to the OR :(|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  young Bessis is attractive to watch as well :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they all 4 are|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 very talented young players|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  NS - one of the best Russian pair, national representetatives lot of times|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  helping hand from defence?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for 10th trick|pg||
nt|rmb1: Help = playing diamonds for declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: so their CC says nv random preempt, vuln disciplined|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  when in dbld partscore, always lead trump - this regulation rarely sucks |pg||
nt|andyv:  18 hcp responding hands hard to keep down|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW will not be able to generate 4@h tricks so 3N will make|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks impossible|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it seems, EW have no game to play|pg||
nt|hedyg: hardly with 20 hcps in N|pg||
nt|kjadams: do not need double finesse that way|pg||
nt|hedyg: i love spotcards :)|pg||
nt|daman: timing is everything|pg||
nt|kjadams: If south has king, contract probably doomed, so a heart now seems sensible.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Even 2 is too high|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: Our operator, William Hernebrink, advises sys on after W 1@h, 1NT on 1@c 8-11 balanced hand |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3@h by NS looks good, even @h game is possible with non-accurate defence|pg||
nt|rmb1: The Polish specs agree it is not possible|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hello|pg||
nt|stewball: hi all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hi John|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and hi John :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: Presumably 5@C is one keycard, 5@D asks for the @HQ, and 5@H denies it - 5NT is a surprise but they've stopped in the making small slam.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should fail even on a @h lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  unlikely to lead a @c here|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will probably settle for a @d lead|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would play small @D now but i guess he knows better than that|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h lead will be ok but auction doesn't call for it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  why is E leading?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  N will need to get back to hand and lead @s to board|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kjadams: Two John's today   I can go by KJ  if it helps :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  something awry here|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 8 rounds EW are 5th, NS 10th|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sga1: N is declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: rather than show count in @H S showed suit preference in @C|pg||
nt|kjadams: From North's perspective, Ace of clubs in South is enough.  KQ is disappointing.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c3|nt|andyv:  lol...my 3rd line of bidding disappeared!|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jcwla: It is understandable why N might choose to bid 2@H, this is the type of hand that could make a @H game with the right holding and some extras in S.  Also, the suit has nice ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: texture.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if he does other way he has 2 losers in @ss|pg||
mc|10|nt|andyv:  I thought they stopped at 3N|pg||

nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: The reason is that N lead a spade from hand out of turn|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but better is to look for Easts distribution. 5@h and perhaps/probably 4@d. @s can be 4-1|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have saved an imp |pg||
nt|mdgraham: very decent 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again one of my normal rubber-hands in East :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: The 21 IMPs must be some kind of carryover from a previous session|pg||
nt|jillan:  sorry partner I am an idiot is what I would like to say and hear when I screw up|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as cards lie i thinkl 5@d rolls in|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: a bit strange since even if it fails he probably wont go 2 down|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|an|alert|nt|mdgraham: 6@d is unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: on a club lead a bit dicey isnt it? |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @S that is |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It seems to me that the @SK switch would in fact have defeated the contract ... that's one to remember|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south need to ruff the third diamond and push throw another club, holds declarer to just spade ace in endgame|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a wild hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: brave 2@S - works well|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzwe: Popular contract|pg||
nt|chick: nah, I don't want to hear that kind of thing ... bridge is a game of mistakes ... would be more interesting to hear his reasoning, even if wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly, but you would expect diamonds and spades to play for twelve tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: he was pretty sure that east would not have played club away from K|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: brave 2 spades by west should be raised|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  maybe they should just bid 4@S directly|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfergolf: There goes the Club k=lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that was 4@S by East, I bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: is this auction for real?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess East could not bid 3@c forcing after the reverse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good stop|pg||
nt|lml: yes but I still think it was worth a go|pg||
nt|lestergold: as well as the fact that with good spade suit and K@c he might have opened the bidding if he held any more high cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, Hmmmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South is content|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 2@s shows @c in their sys|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: brainfreeze|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, Rubens transfers|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks William|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: but w seem to be enjoying his meatballsub atleast :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jillan:  this has better chance though than the previous one|pg||
nt|chick: why waste time bidding, just set the contract at 4@S for whoever has the longest spades :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but  magnus explanation tells everything|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  this auction seems cumbersome|pg||
nt|lml: yes all of that is true but I hate it when it turns out that for some reason East didn't bid and did have the card|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: cross ruff in the defence after a @c or @hA|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my defense works also|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am getting impression n/s at this table are quite conservative |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this wil make |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1 they played 5 @D X at the other table|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  if not playing Lebensohl, E had a problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c is not a think of beauty when 6 is a laydown|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: whre did S find that 3NT bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  thing|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: result seems to be 3D-1 insted of 4 spades|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|jillan:  yup,simplifies the bidding, and would really show skill. NOT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: he might have gone more off also becaus he still didnt know the lie of the diamonds |pg||
nt|lml: unlikely but possible... East was even less likely to have the DA at that point and even then |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nigel_k:  They needed to agree clubs and start cue bidding to find the @hK then West can bid 6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: But declarer played weakly as well surely - he should have taken a heart ruff for his 8th trick|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: yes agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: he aslo saw west signal for a club Linda|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So to be honest, all three of them will want to forget that hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Not that we are letting them ...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: true it might have been a lie but that was not likely here|pg||
nt|lml: I agree though great stop here.   Probably possible only when West is a passed hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzwe: 2NT was GF and 3NT showed balanced hand|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pc|s8|nt|pelu: so the overnid came from N|pg||

nt|hedyg: even being last in this field is excellent :p|pg||
nt|kjadams: Love to know what 5N requested.    Certainly Jxxxxx would be a good Grand...|pg||
nt|jcwla: For most 5NT would confirm the presence of all keycards and the queen of trumps.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this slam well under 50%|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS should get to 3N at this vul|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A solid result for the winners|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jillan:  ormally not good when one puts on the breaks all the time and the other one has the gas pedal well footedf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C by N now, can be 15-17 balanced|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S will depend on how the spade suit is tackled |pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway score is the same|pg||
mb|d|nt|iceking: alot of pdships actually work like that|pg||
nt|kjadams: but not after the Queen ask and denial|pg||
mb|2N!|an|utgångskrav med stöd|nt|sfoxa:  with 25 points, EW have no game to play, but NS can compete till 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Likely 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: wheather he open 3 or 1@C they will reach 3nt|pg||
nt|stewball: 3nt coming|pg||
nt|sga1: Double Dummy, 13 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW may well land in 6@d|pg||
mb|3C|an|minimum|nt|garnetts: it is a complete guess |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more example of contemporary style - 1@d opening|pg||
nt|hedyg: too good for a 3@c opening|pg||
nt|kjadams: She's not sung yet.    30 VP lead going into final match on a 60 point scale is not a lock.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Any game here's a challenge.... - perhaps 4@H the better|pg||
nt|hedyg: Polish @c opening|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW can rich 4@h here, tough this contract have no play seemingly|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  NS have enough for the game, but bidding it looks easier than making|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c is on with the @d finesse|pg||
nt|sga1: 6@D shud be final spot|pg||
nt|daman: the Herbst's are in 3rd place|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyv: Hello to all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and EW - famous and experienced pair from the Netherlands |pg||
nt|bobholl: after the double 6@C looks good|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  rather marked with dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be alble to make it without much problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  able|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@D transfer to 2@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: actaully I am talking rubbish--need a coffee--you can't really get it wrong can you?  |pg||
nt|hedyg: now he just has to make it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W could lead a small @s giving the contract, but with E on lead this game looks like impossible|pg||
nt|sga1: What system EW r playing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyv: very cold)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, looks easier as in previous board|pg||
nt|andyv:  another no play contract...unfortunately tough to stay out of|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if @s will be lead, declarer has to cash 2 top @ds in attempt to pitch @s loser on @h thereafter|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, and will make 7 that way|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so we, but they have different mind|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sfoxa:  looks like|pg||
nt|jcwla: A pretty moth-eaten vul opener but nothing sits too badly here.|pg||
nt|rmb1: or not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  commentator's curse :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd opt for 3nt as well, but...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, another red suit must be ruffed to bring success for defence|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer can probably survive a @D ruff by South|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  For S, it's hard to imagine @d ruff is of no use this time|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  so, the right time to stick to the bridge table for round the day :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: or as Michael Barel says setting up the 5th @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: marked is assuming , W could well have the Q@D |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: 4@S may be ok too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS can overboard easily|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first board played was a good illustration of normal matter of course: bid what you have and lead what you have. Suppose, it will be repeated several times.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't know of too many Ws that would lead a low @s from that holding but I'm sure they are out there!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. the first one was from the topic "don't show it to beginners", but this one is notmal|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|othered1: south looks at this fine spot and is happy he's not vulnerable|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, both @h and @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  altough without it, EW would hardly bid game|pg||
nt|bobholl: as he has the @H queen :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: Even with poor guessing this one should come home|pg||
nt|stewball: declarer doesnt know everything is sitting perfectly\|pg||
nt|kjadams: 9 with bad guesses, 11 with good guesses.|pg||
nt|stewball: @s seems to be 4/4 that will help|pg||
nt|kjadams: Lot's of speculation that it's extra length ask.   Seems reasonable, but can't confirm.|pg||
nt|hedyg: unavoidable 4@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  they are over 3nt, seemingly 4@h finishes the bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but E can survive without @d lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no, he couldn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see how|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I was wrong|pg||
pc|d5|nt|garnetts: I agree Sveta--everyone opens this sort of hand these days--except me--I prefer Roth-Stone ideology where first and second seat bids are sound |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I can find 1 losing option: playing @sJ in the first round of the suit|pg||
nt|rmb1: Presumably East will run the 10 once he has checked his calculations|pg||
nt|hedyg: a question of timing now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  I'd like to know what did 1@s bid mean|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as a kibitser pointed out, S like his hand much more than it's worth|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and only @h lead will beat this contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: Open room playing faster (3 boards scored).  Open room NS did not let through 4S on  27.  10IMP to Dutch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even  now, @h return creates problem for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|sga1: May be 4th suit force|pg||
nt|sga1: if natural bidding|pg||
nt|sga1: any one knows system of EW?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I was told exactly the same by several French specs. Merci.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4th-suit, game forcing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: and not doubled|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have liked N to bal with 1nt here instead of dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead best|pg||
nt|sharkey: But East on lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  attempt to pitch @d losers on @c will reduce W trump holding destined to 2 tricks anyway with this @h split|pg||
nt|sharkey: This plays better from N - else @S lead wud also disrupt communicarions|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even with E hand, trump start looks better than any other|pg||
nt|sharkey: *communications|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @h continuation after @sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: of course a defensive mistake is always possible, but at this level we do not expect too many of those|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  declarer sees a lot of possibilities, I suppose|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, the question is which one to choose?|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is IMP scoring and the scores from all 8 tables are included.  On the Movie button you'll see the score from the other BBO table, but the IMP score may not be correct.|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think all options are losing ones Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are aware of it, not so declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see, how it goes. Should admit, trump lead created the biggest bundle of problems for declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *normal, sorry|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: and he has it right|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  juicy result for NS|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@c - they play double checkback, so 2@c showed any invitational hand|pg||
nt|sga1: Also they seem to be playing 1@h rebid forcing.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has impossible task of finding a @s lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N should decide for @s lead, even from his unattractive (for lead) holding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d suit - is a base one of E, @h lead looks like being for nothing|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like a @h lead coming up|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, with @h lead N wouldn't help declarer, yes|pg||
nt|sga1: unbid suit is @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  there are we seeing @sQ by S, not so N :)|pg||
nt|sga1: with @S lead he may well sell the contract, he doesn't know.|pg||
nt|sga1: spec says 3NT by W says 4-card @S suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  right time for @d lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: not happy to lead @d from K@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play @H|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @h is ok, not so @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: Roland will need to make a new list of slow players|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  so this N quest is rather for feeling, not for logic|pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: South is trying to find a way of defeating this --but he can see there is virtually none by now unless a club trick is on the way |pg||
nt|jcwla: This hand could conceivably depend on W's rebid after 1@H - if W is on lead to NT, has an easy @C lead that might make the difference.|pg||
nt|kjadams: This is a really impressive event.   16 of the best players in the world competing for $10,000 Top Prize|pg||
nt|hedyg: even coming last is prestigeous!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobholl: but 5th @S will develop|pg||
nt|daman: prestige isn't translated into cash unfortunately :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcwla: N that is.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: voila the |pg||
nt|hedyg: H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  this time, altough, both declarer and defence are on the thin path. 8 tricks aren't the question, but if somebody bids game...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this tournament was nominated to the best bridge event in Russia in 2007, giving Russian player "live" expereince of meeting Hacketts or Zia at the table|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  @d lead was a kind of trap for declarer - playing this suit by himself, he'll rather find @d A onsite |pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes @H now succeed for defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  that lead was not worth the wait|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even @s brings a trick now |pg||
nt|rmb1: Oh|pg||
mc|10|nt|othered1: Did the double distinguish between possible hands?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that way seems better than other options|pg||
nt|andyv:  althouth 3N may be normal, W opening 1@s might have slowed N down with only 1 @s stopper.|pg||

pc|s2|nt|lestergold: now will a jump here showm the void|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: well this seems to play well in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes they have bid this beautifully|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H is easy to make, but 3N looks fine too ... opponents have no suit to set up|pg||
nt|harmon: low heart here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: at least this way shows five spades, which is probably more important |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can make 10 it seems on the "marked" guess in diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: cant see this 1n making|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defence knows nothing about declarer's hand which makes it very difficult|pg||
nt|golfergolf: No problem now|pg||
nt|lml: perfect ... bravo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done indeed |pg||
nt|Walddk4: indeed, well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: a real example of how to bid this kind of hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jillan:  he is lucky in the @H distribution and also a bit in the @D and @S them being onside|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|harmon: he read my mind!!!|pg||
nt|harmon: must be illterate:)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I have to concede board 13 to you mike, as the (awful in my opinion) 1 spade overcall was repeated in the other room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: This is a handicap event, and the NS team started with 21 IMP plus|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: 1 more for declarer unless defence slip up|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, if playing with the Unlucky Expert, he would win the diamond and play a club, expecting North to be void|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not quite sure how North knew about solid trumps and extra trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: Not 4@h for me. S has decided 3n1 after a 2@h bid from N. If interested , S should have bid 3@d for checking the majors. N can have 5-4, 5-5 or 6-4 inmajors|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's the ninth trick |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Marked in clubs also|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: I'm surprised at the @D pitch ... E could still have the @D9 from W's point of view|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: pard (and opps)  probably a bit surprised when a 5/2/6/0 hits the table|pg||
nt|lml: I think the self splinter should show extra trump... it would for me|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: suspect that was a higher diamond played by west first round|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
mc|10|nt|ralfwil: S can now squeezwe W for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, ok. But double is eminently reasonable, and does bring hearts into the picture|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  but we ought remember - being at the table under BBO spot - is a kind of additional pressure.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Note that North was the "safe hand"    Much harder for North to play a 2nd round of spades.|pg||
nt|stewball: not so much if @dJ was smith|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case not sure quite why they propelled to game, looks like an invite rejection to me.|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm no Hacketts and no Zia there|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not this year|pg||
mb|1N!|an|13-17|nt|sfoxa:  even for world class players|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  vote for 1@h opening from N|pg||
nt|daman: had South pitched an early @C  they might have defeated it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.slavacup.com/  for the tournament website. Click on the USA flag for an English version|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  someone for overcall with E's hand?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s game for NS is easy to play, but what about bid it?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jillan:  yeah but not together with Pards hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Here's a good chance for east to get back into the match|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NT game for EW looks good|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  6@s without problem in play, may be hard to bid after N opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@S I think is the bid of choice...|pg||
nt|mareczek: another slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after all, we have next board|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@d transfer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  isn't my choice, but I now few who would willing |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s Q is presumably by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  same with previous board - 3nt doesnt look like easy contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h by N... favorable vul for EW will get them in auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW probably play ELC with their take out doubles|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  oh, going wrong. this time N decided to remain silent|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, @c and little bit strenght vs. hearts and a little bit lenght|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  oh. I'm wrong.  but can't agree with considering N's hand as destructive one|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H=@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E find @d lead, EW can beat 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: what should w bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H maybe |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  contemporary openings became lighter till impossible - S hand wasn't opening worth in accordance with Acol standartds |pg||
nt|mareczek: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r2.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one looks better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this wouldn't prevent EW from bidding high, suppose|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs to get into this bidding soon|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Polish Club by EW - 1@c may include strong opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: running scoers|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW would better to stop low|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@S denies 4 cards|pg||
nt|kjadams: Interesting point John.   Smith in that case would say I am known not to have the Jack, therefore encouraging is extra length.   Still requires sound agreements.|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s inquires as to type of raise (some play it as which suit would responder accept a game try|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play acol style with 5 card @s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: N Splinter bid 4@H - as suggested by kib|pg||
nt|mareczek: scores|pg||
nt|garnetts: Spotlight on South now |pg||
nt|stewball: i think the NS action in the OR guaranteed they would bid slam|pg||
nt|stewball: propelled them|pg||
nt|kjadams: not to have T. |pg||
nt|stewball: 4@s now?|pg||
nt|kjadams: Zia won last year, playing with Roy Welland|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Martínez|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for me, 2 aces isn't my dream hand for Multi (desctructive) opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: well done |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  once more - lucky NS, this time with @h split |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the North hand is too good for a weak two--nearer to a strong two in my view lol :)  |pg||
nt|hedyg: here without transfer bids N could hardly enter the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  funny in modern bridge how you can't get the @c suit in the auction (if you are overcaller) after opps open 1@c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 rounds of @d and one more after in with @hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jillan:  3NT should make....|pg||
nt|jillan:  or could anyhow|pg||
nt|othered1: This hand might work better without the 2@C opening -- a common result with a minor 1-suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: scroll back :)|pg||
nt|iceking: horrible hand in any system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but what is your rebid after 1@D  1M?|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@s and 3 @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have to defend carefully to beat it|pg||
nt|sga1: well done|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice lead to find|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H shows 5-5, the E hand is limited to 15 hcps by opening 1@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a stronger hand he would have opened 1@c|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Today I think all players would open 3rd hand - many also 1. & 2. hand|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi Roland, hi everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Roberto|pg||
nt|ybob: Hello :)|pg||
nt|ybob: what is 1@D by S ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good question|pg||
nt|ybob: i agree with 1@H but i like pass 1@S|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@D = no 5M|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer has no chance to play @c wrong, and 1 trick in @s is enough|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price is right for 5@c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's only first step, 3 more to follow|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N can see that @h lead will rather attack declarer communication line|pg||
nt|hedyg: our kind Polish specs point out that he is limited to 17|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would not deny 4 cards @d in my 2nd bid even with a minimum opening|pg||
nt|daman: same here|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|daman: finding your fit is important in bridge|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: 2 other major|pg||
nt|othered1: easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  however NS may already be a little shellshocked from the first 2 boards|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceking: 2sp probably over 1@H if you open 1@D |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, Italian style|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent treatment|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant see open this east hand 1@D |pg||
nt|jillan:  me neither|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10 or 11 tricks here - coffee time...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, really - 3rd hand allows that. I disregarded this "pecularity".|pg||
nt|ybob: pd shows 5@S so this shows limits values|pg||
nt|daman: now they have a bit of trouble|pg||
nt|daman: 1@H - 2@D - 3@D - 3NT would be too easy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: EW may have missed a good sac|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - @s game is cool|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 1@s looks better even with 2cards by W|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 3@H was 15-17 5-5|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty specs !|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not my idea of a red weak 2 in @H's with 12 "berries": A 10 K 9 Q 6 J 5 T 4 9 2 8 1 -- would want more like 18.  And yet again S defers to N's "hearts."  Really surprised @S's not ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: mentioned at all, deep position.|pg||
nt|kjadams: possible auction confusion here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is: oh grrrrrrr he doesnt know i have 4 card fit, i have to show it now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|iceking: problem doing so is you have such a powerful hand, you will need rest of your bidding trying to recover |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can because a jump in the other major is artificial as I play it|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3 @D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|iceking: and usually end up just guessing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can be a hand too good for a 3@D rebid|pg||
nt|ybob: 5 tricks by EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and points count should help avoid @h finess |pg||
nt|hedyg: a slow 3@ds :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they would better to stop here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in 4NT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: Actually, in Kaplan-Sheinwold, it can go 1@D -1M - 3@D forcing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guessing @c right ends declarer's problems, even if not, he can escape finding W with short @h but 2 trumps only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh! I'm wrong|pg||
nt|kjadams: well done|pg||
nt|andyv:  this can make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W is on the right track|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ybob: now K ?|pg||
nt|ybob: K shows 3@C and good time to play another @S from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have to attack @d in time|pg||
nt|ybob: @D will play from S|pg||
nt|ybob: K@C , @S, and S low @D |pg||
nt|stewball: next|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h probably down 1 on a @d lead by S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: Evidently.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: 4NT to play for me|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so for me (and seemingly for S with his black holdings)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could cue @s or soemthing for slam and why would he want to play slam when he bid 3NT earlier?|pg||
nt|daman: apparently    an immediate 3@D shows a strong hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|iceking: but it doesnt show a hand to good for 1@D opening:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for the defense, W has one J too many|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|kjadams: I usually punish my partners for pulling me out of 3N by bidding slam.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it does, but over 2@d the N hand is nice |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: showing a hand you'd have opened 2@C if suit were a major and you have hand an extra natural bid along the way.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I try to avoid opening 2@C with a long minor, especially diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  hand pretty much plays itself|pg||
mc|8|nt|othered1: have had|pg||
nt|rmb1: A Roland slam, missed and not making 12 :)|pg||

nt|rnc: handicap, however based on all the pairs tournaments the player has played...|pg||
nt|rnc: ... A team's hcp is calculated as the average of the players involved in the specific segment. The hcp-average for the two teams is compared and the difference then divided by 10, ...|pg||
nt|rnc: which gives us the number of IMP's per board the 'less skilled' team get as a bonus. As it is a KO-match, even a fraction of an IMP might be important at the end of the match...|pg||
nt|chick: wow, ice cold 7N|pg||
nt|jillan:  Thank you Carl|pg||
nt|golfergolf: @@@S worked well|pg||
nt|golfergolf: 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Certainly right-sided the contract|pg||
nt|golfergolf: board 3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: heart lead = 6@s 1@h 4@d 1@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another slam|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but thism one not as lucky|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|rnc: The 21 IMP's 'bonus' for Vintage is for the whole match (of 24 boards).|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt looks like maximum on this board|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N probably for the minors|pg||
nt|andyv:  W trying to pull the trigger and bid 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: yes, but there was no alert|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 14 played other way up OR, down on the club lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lestergold: wont surprise me if e/wplay in 4@h in practice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Running scores at http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=3427|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 level still safe for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: unless a club lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what to lead....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @s9 or 8 would be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  5@h is safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: can be made with the safety play in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  yes you need either the @S or the @D to come home, and they both do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Curious to find a Chinese team playing in the Swedish District finals|pg||
nt|henryb:  why? declarer can pick up trumps|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: can west show his clubs without implyhin he has 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 1H was 4+, 3C shows longer clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is this Steen Moller sitting East?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: No, Christian Möller|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Christia|pg||
nt|golfergolf: n|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all this players are from a district league in two swedish cities, i dont think any of them we would know|pg||
nt|golfergolf: also 6@S on b4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and will|pg||
nt|mdgraham: somehow you feel this is the sort of hand that ought not to be allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: because @SQ first is correct play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, sorry - West has @s9, so it's ok|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is not a safety play, just ordinary techmiwue|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: I guess I have the wrong nationality as well ...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe East can double for a heart lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: good duck |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Peking duck|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Standard suit combination|pg||
nt|henryb:  technique|pg||
nt|lml: it is the kind of hand that you use to illustrate safety plays... an instructive hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well u can only pick up 4 trumps if they are in south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so easy when there isa 2 way option|pg||
nt|Walddk4: IT's not a safety play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played, it seems|pg||
nt|henryb:  strange play unless "Jack Denies"|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jillan:  15 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: Yes, if any of @s or @d breaks - 13 tricks|pg||
nt|jillan:  now see if they can bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: W has now denied 5H when not bidding 3H|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a @h lead will sink this|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a matter of technique|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: safety in the sense of playing a spade to the Q first|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: 4@D??|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i was expecting 3N after 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E fell in love with his hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  S will be happy with this result|pg||
nt|lestergold: technically notm a safety play i agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  safety plays (definition) involve conceding a possibly unnecessary trick yo avoid losing too many|pg||
nt|lestergold: however its become rather academic|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and therefore 7nt is better than 7@s|pg||
nt|rnc: It's with mixed feelings I watch (and perhaps comments) this match, since it's my teammates that are playing in the E/W team :), the same team that lost the nail biting finals ...|pg||
nt|rnc: (however under the name of San Sac) with a couple of IMP's after 96 boards the previous year.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 7nt from E with the @d suit|pg||
nt|rnc: For those interesting in the CC of E/W it's available at http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc11/fc_main_en.htm - check under Convention Cards|pg||
nt|chick: knowing all aces+@SK, E only needs to know about the @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E knows W has 5S, 4C and all aces and spade queen are counted for|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or 7@s as well and W can decide the final contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: not sure why west gave up|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: perhaps trying to stay away from NT with a void in pard's suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: weoh dear|pg||
pc|s8|nt|golfergolf: Spell their names in Chinese Characters|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think they just make up the names of teams|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: fell in love - but now close to a divorce :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least he gets the 150 honours|pg||
nt|chick: yikes|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think he was frightened of going off in 3N with 8 top tricks and bound to get another in one of the suits he over valued his hand thats why he went on|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E has to contemplate over his lousy bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: west bid his hand perfectly and if anything had better than he promised|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzwe: 7D was suggestion to play in that suit, so I think W should have bid 7NT|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: agree magnus 5nt also shows @sQ as E already has denied her|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: thats correct =)|pg||
nt|lestergold: u are absolutely right Henry|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|sybarra: probably the night before over cocktails  |pg||

nt|iceking: 1@D-4@S p p 4nt maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only makeable game here is 3NT by N-S. Impossible to get to|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. when player starts with -12 imps score in 1st board, his level of cautioness rises at once|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  last board of the round. next one is starting soon, so stay with Russian frost! thank you for watching and sharing your ideas|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Ivan, thank you for the job done. and keep trying - we have 5 more rounds today :)|pg||

nt|kjadams: http://www.slavacup.com/|pg||
nt|kjadams: Sorry Partner :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: If they bid and make a bunch of spades against you on that last one, crawl back in bed.|pg||
nt|sga1: simple 13 tricks in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  why did W reject his last chance to win, if @h behaving well with small defence mistake? just by the way|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  bundle of points by EW, they have to make good use from them|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry yes Vice Champions|pg||
nt|daman: the fat lady is starting to drink tea and honey|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ybob: good result to Ew, NS win 8 tricks NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and the number of boards played provides you with pros and cons of your approach. |pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C lead directing with @H fit ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|kjadams: You will find two events there.    A "top 16" which is what we are watching.|pg||
nt|kjadams: It is invitational only and has only superstars|pg||
nt|chessmaste: It seems unfair that you could make game in a 4-3 spade fit, or a 5-1 heart fit, but not a 5-4 diamond fit (and 3Nt was cold as well) |pg||
mb|4S|nt|iceking: i guess you overcall 1@S |pg||
nt|othered1: impossible because east won't let it play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after all, yes. good for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this trump suit is better in W's point of view|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Each round consist of 8 board and the scoring is on IMPs converted to VPs - max score per round is 60-0|pg||
nt|jcwla: From the nature of this W bed it looks like E probably meant the 2@C on prev hand as xfr cuebid.|pg||
nt|jcwla: bid not bed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Wow, east is really walking t his|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As the cards lie, EW can make 5@D|pg||
nt|iceking: and should make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you guess diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @H lead keeps 3NT on 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: imo Gino thought Bessis had 4 cards in @H|pg||
nt|stewball: an uncomfortable 3@d i'm sure|pg||
nt|kjadams: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|kjadams: this link has current scores|pg||
mb|5S|nt|iceking: you will when you see N @H 9J drop |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Top spot, 3NT by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  makes sense in that meaning namely|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  could help E decide either to defend or not|pg||
nt|hedyg: they lost against Duboin Ferraro !|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West's 2@D is transfer to @H - either to play or GF I assume|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm, will S decide to convert this dbl into penalty?|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - dont think so - choice between pest and cholera....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it would be useful for NS, but hardly possible|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  somebody draws conclusions, somebody - doesn't|pg||
mb|5N|nt|othered1: Now east is sure to guess @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  re-hello|pg||
nt|garnetts: cards poorly placed for NS--they stopped pretty low but this will suffer a club ruff in due cousre too|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the friendly @H position slam is on|pg||
nt|kjadams: Glad Hammon did not see that auction.   3N was a possible contract...|pg||
nt|daman: Hamman|pg||
nt|kjadams: yes, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Will East let him play there? No|pg||
nt|ybob: lead problem to W|pg||
nt|ybob: @H probably|pg||
nt|hedyg: unbiddable ofc|pg||
mb|6C|nt|hedyg: 1@c followed by 3@cs shows 18+|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: and 550|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|ybob: friendly all |pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT to play - oh joy...|pg||
nt|hedyg: would Gawrys make an effort if he knew about the @H fit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 1@s - acceptance with 3 cards probably, 2@h natural, inv+|pg||
nt|mareczek: Rusinow lead - second from the sequence of honours|pg||
nt|bessi2: this lead will not paralyse declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@S x wud be off 2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Round 4 of Slava Cup in progress. torunament site http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  don't be surprised with the opening - 1@c can include 5332 with 5@d, 1@d opening - unbalanced hands|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: East bid 5@D all by himself|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can prevent declarer from 9th trick, but it isn't obvious|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now S has to cash @c A and continue @h |pg||
nt|hedyg: everybody will lead @h|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  bearing in mind, W may pass in the first round and re-open with DBL thereafter, EW can land into 3@d - not so easy to beat|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W can beat 4@s underleading @h ace, and even without this lead, defenders will take 1 heart and 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|kjadams: 8 tricks if guess clubs.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jillan:  he got HIGH from the last hand >)(|pg||
nt|iceking: neither table overcalled 4@S |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS are off to a good start and won't take unnecessary risks I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  "peacful" hand after all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *peaceful|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after this bidding and first lead (nothing to ruff) - coffee-board :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 5, NS got to 3N making 4 for a 12 imp swing and on board 4, EW did not get to slam in OR for another 12 imp swing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a good example of the fundamental that grand slams have no play - the are claimed, if the bidding was correct|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess I thought east was walking this before I saw the other table's actions.  Inconceivable that I"d sell to 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: i bid in my world is just clear-cut |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this one will be claimed at trick one|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stewball: this will require very careful play |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but the matter of course would be rather the same (2@h instead of 2@d for pairs not using transfers)|pg||
nt|garnetts: excellent play to lead the @D earlier but it wont help |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 clubs, sorry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  that helps declarer|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  So 5@H is a phantom|pg||

nt|andyv:  maybe, but with NS not vul, the return isn't very much for a penalty dbl so, in the long run, you are better off making it a lead directing dbl.|pg||
nt|sybarra: so is mine as a math/econ major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing North could do there|pg||
nt|henryb:  also methods where West apparently could not show his two suiter so that East could appreciate the value of the @hJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, not sure of the rights and wrong but that strange Ace was essential, so well done by north|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: he asked and got answer "J from JT9xx"|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed it was, and an excellent play|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: 3NT in N the only game - but impossible to bid|pg||

mb|4N|nt|vugraphzwe: and 5D EW|pg||
nt|pelu: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4s can make on this hand|pg||

nt|bjacobs: weird stuff|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW can make 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: "lower unbids"|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  back to the 4 major street|pg||
nt|lml: East had shown a fit about 17 points and useful controls|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bjacobs: getting weirder by the minute|pg||
nt|lml: but either player can make a move for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes east was minimum for his strong club and west had such a control rich slammish hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  when did he show useful controls?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Watching cricket; England not too far away from chasing 338|pg||
nt|lml: the heart cuebid|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|chick: 5@D can be made double dummy, but I don't think I'd be happy playing it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: D on E's hand is not my cup of tea|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, I suppose it might make, but probably it will get what it deserves|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he might make for lack of convenient dummy entry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It could, but there are some possible entries.  He might tryr a spade to the queen, and then North pretty much has to give him that entry in one suit or another|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 278-2. Strauss 156*|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South must expect North to have quite a good hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and with a ht lead also,  need to see how he went down |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good bid by East|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS is an easy game on NS without a @s lead, but find it? and 5@d on a finess|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: poor W can not lead pard's suit |pg||
nt|golfergolf: 4@H in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 H looks easier maybe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good news indeed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: difficult but maybe a wrong guess by south|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how many overs left, Roland? |pg||
nt|henryb:  really? that was dragged out of him after West made two slam tries and he attempted to sign off in 3N|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: plop|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: 8 overs remain|pg||
nt|lml: he showed a heart control dragged or not.  17 HCP and a heart fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 51 in 8 - well on|pg||
nt|henryb:  and you have 12 HCP and no aces outside trump|pg||
nt|lml: the five level should be safe almost all the time|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: very frustrating when you have a long suit plus entries and pard cannot lead your suit|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think east did not bid 4@d because he was scared of them making 4 vul1s|pg||
nt|lestergold: sapdes|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|sybarra: E now understands why |pg||
pc|c6|nt|nigel_k:  The E/W hands fit very well and they can also make 11 tricks in diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: blackwood would work|pg||
mc|12|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand even if trumps were behaving |pg||

nt|Walddk2: It was a great bid if East had let him play there|pg||
nt|iceking: north can never ever bid 3nt there without Qxx in @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have passed 4@D|pg||
nt|othered1: right, so it was a serious effort, not something to mislead east|pg||
nt|ybob: easy 4@H here|pg||
nt|stewball: N not able to get the @h count|pg||
nt|kjadams: unfortunate defense.  I'd have liked to see how declared attacked spades for 1 loser|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly. you'll be in a good company getting one down in game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|andyv:  we are on board 31 after we played 32 first|pg||
mb|2D!|an|svag hö/21-23NT|nt|sfoxa:  @s game based on distribution, not on power|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think most pairs would do better to agree 2NT is never natural in comp.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: sry ofc also lose 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  will NS manage to reach it?|pg||
nt|stewball: strip @cs and a duck a @s to N|pg||
nt|kjadams: since North did not make a takeout double, might be tough to play for 11 HCP|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 tens upgraded S hand, seemingly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H X -2 was worth 13 imps to NS on bd 11 when Lauria took off to 6NT!|pg||
nt|hedyg: the bidding there was 3@H-4@D-6NT-X|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not really - the datum is currently 2 IMPs for E/W on the deal |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|iceking: undo on W pass please|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in each round, 2 pairs have to split 60VP between them, 30:30 means  a draw|pg||
nt|hedyg: so there must have been some more fun|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  suppose, several EW will be in 3@c or even 4@c (S should compete), so this result isn't awful |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 5@D on - may need @S finesse|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like another tiny game |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm  for results and running scores|pg||
nt|rmb1: Traditional shape and values for take-out double !|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r8.htm for livescores|pg||
nt|kjadams: ducking spade to north loses when south has King.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  once more - don't pay much attention to the scores. it's pairs event with IMPs scoring|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D is Italian style 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did pass|pg||
nt|iceking: no undo?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: nope|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW should find their way to 5@d |pg||
nt|hedyg: double= a 2suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: well in that case you play the Q:)|pg||
nt|kjadams: given the ace king of hearts, i'd error by tossing south in with spade.|pg||
nt|stewball: like i said,it required careful play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now NS can compete with 3@d, if N is brave enough|pg||
nt|stewball: looks like a normal 3@d bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  leading EW to the bold game|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c by S leaddirecting, rather than bidding 2@H with xxxx|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would have bid 2@H with the South hand :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and her Mom as well :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: After a XX, rebidding before parner has a chance to double is generally a warning to partner|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Many players would suugest that 2@C says that is the only suit I am playable in partner |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  from the other hand, in 3NT from W seat, N may choose @h honour for the first lead, allowing to make the contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  having spades, E has to concede to the partner's @h for playing game|pg||
nt|andyv:  13 tricks available|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT minors?hmmm or Rubensohlish?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N's dbl is near to promise 4 cards in @h, so our Moms would|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 2aces and 6-5 shape with void |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I was optimistic :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm with N in his decision. 14 points, but 5 cards suit and 10-s|pg||
nt|bobholl: now the battle is on @S vs @D |pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure that 1@s shows more than 4 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Yvan|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told 4@H= better @ss than @H but you play pd|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@D does not show 4 cards necessarily|pg||
nt|hedyg: so N brings the long @cs into the picture|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe he should have bid his suits naturally rather than 2NT?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: and he won't go for 800. Silence is golden|pg||
nt|ybob: rare t out with single @H :) but works fine !|pg||
nt|hedyg: a matter of agreements|pg||
nt|kjadams: did 2H show values?|pg||
nt|hedyg: since over 2NT his pd's bid really doesnt tell him much|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ybob: only @H lead defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  several pairs use Bergen raises in N position - could make it easier|pg||
nt|bobholl: X is i had @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: Volcker:" like i care"|pg||
nt|stewball: likley p/c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W is willing to compete so much|pg||
pc|h3|nt|iceking: he did though avoid the 800 |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but they reached game, after all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  he was about to steal the contract from EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looking for 4cards in @s?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 2@c relay|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  game temptation...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  current results are here http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r13.htm|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Hard to reach 3NT on these cards|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: might be their strategy against this arcane system.  What's your defense to 1@C?|pg||
nt|iceking: seems like there stragety is to not bid at all|pg||
nt|bvdahl: rehi, everyone. Had a sudden emergency, but now I should be back in business :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double as generic takeout, overcalls natural|pg||
nt|othered1: generic takeout of what?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: any suit|pg||
nt|iceking: majorish |pg||
nt|othered1: maybe west just didin't have a bid for th is specific pattern?|pg||
nt|iceking: dbl of 1@C usually played in sweden as takout with 4-4 in majors|pg||
nt|iceking: could always bid 1@S i doubt that means anything else then @S |pg||
nt|hedyg: especially since 1@d was a 3rd seat opening, i.e. could be weak|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS are already beyound their possibilities|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5 tricks to concede|pg||
nt|hedyg: a good time to pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: he "knows"|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I don't believe all this - I have sent a runner to the table to check|pg||
nt|hedyg: 7 anything is on|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: Pls disregard the score you see Team 2 12 IMPs Team 1 0 IMPs. |pg||
nt|rmb1: Perhaps 2NT shows a maximum 10/11 in which case 3@D may be GF ,,, no its not|pg||
nt|bobholl: he hasn't passed yet :)|pg||
nt|sga1: seems -1|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bessi2: strange looking dbl by west|pg||
nt|jcwla: Need to have agreement about meaning of 3@S here: general GT, trump quality GT, 1-2-3 Stop, etc.  |pg||
nt|stewball: pass or correct|pg||
nt|jcwla: So many finesses, so little time.|pg||
nt|kjadams: spade finesse first since that has reentry if fails.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid game Game  - Vul Bonus being 500|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not a good round for EW|pg||
nt|mareczek: 5@c looks like sensible |pg||
nt|mareczek: contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer has to work hard to escape to 1 down only|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be he loses 3 @D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s was cold so np to go off|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  he got a chance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not at ll, but E can rely on several pts by partner - 1NT was passed by N |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W did well with such opening. these 10 points deserve it|pg||
nt|andyv:  hand a little too rich to open as a multi|pg||
nt|hedyg: after all this noise i feel let down|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  6@s as sacrifice may well lead to 7@d under pressure|pg||
nt|hedyg: after XX you know it is not your board so giving pd a leaddirector looks right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  to collect 9 tricks in 3@d is much easier than in 3NT|pg||
nt|kjadams: If north has king and ducks, back to guessing.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceking: he is very lucky not going minus  420 here vs his own 650  imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: "For the rich they sing."|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  wow! they are more ambitious |pg||
nt|mareczek: even after club lead it makes...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E has to establish @d s to win|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like their agreement worked as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  counting the 13th trick will be the key for E|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this opening, I do prefer to score -50 (or 100) in tiny game, than +170 ot +200 in dull partscore|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Chagas finess in @c helps, but W have to decide for|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, no, sorry, I'm wrong|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 6@h S is happy to dbl|pg||
nt|kjadams: Neet to shift to clubs and then back to diamonds to beat 4S.  Continuing D will not do it.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are we heading for a major upset? Boye B's are hot favourites despite the 21 IMP handicap they sustained|pg||
nt|mareczek: E takes in hand, cashes @dA, crosses toi the dummy with @cQ, ruffs diamod high, draws trumps and concedes @d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now it's possible to score 4 ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|othered1: but some of us dont like to get our shorter suit into the auction as an initial action.  West likely thought he's have another chance, then just chose to "stay fixed."|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 5N|pg||
nt|andyv:  Gawrys too fast for me:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  E can see 12 tricks... the 13th is hard to spot (the 6th @h)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: Some fix.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|iceking: Is there a link Roland to Boyes fan club|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Piotr Gawrys doesn't play much, but is very famous for both - sharp bridge mind and sharp tongue|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: As Sveta pointed out a creative 3 NT from W may also have worked on @HQ lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: the cards again lie well |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s return can create communication troubles, but slightly ones only|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I'd bet anything that Boye B would be winning after scoring the first 38 IMP's of the match|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|bobholl: made now :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: huge chance|pg||

pc|c9|pg||

mb|1S|nt|golfergolf: 7?|pg||
nt|lestergold: only part scores here again|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jillan:  1@S dbl|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H a fair game, but..|pg||
nt|lestergold: not today|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a natural 2@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is cold E-W Mike|pg||
nt|henryb:  At mach1 or mach2? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry u are right|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, 7@S is there - but realistically, they will do extremely well to even get to the small slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades cant be attacked|pg||
nt|lml: yes natural playing forcing clubs and it had an amazing preemptive effect on ew|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding it tho unlikely|pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually, not cold, but hard to beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: any thing wrong with 2 D? |pg||
pc|dK|nt|jillan:  simplifies things|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this is not well judged|pg||
nt|sybarra: other room bid 2 nt |pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: on their way now, but probably only to 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Nice 3@D by east|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what hts stopper he had|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless 3@d is forcing, this looks a good pass|pg||
nt|golfergolf: Is 2@C gf?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 10+ i belive|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: now he has shown 10-12 |pg||
nt|sybarra: junk stayman |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nice, but a little disastrous|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I didnt see east hadnt bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|golfergolf: Bye Shirley, Mike and spess, I have to go to another room|pg||
nt|sybarra: danke Germ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Germ. don't forget your passport|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: must be a musunderstanding |pg||
nt|pelu: What did East have for diner - strong vitamin-drinks? |pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: D was for penalties and I can't see why W didn't pass with two aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely west has shown his two suiter and east's douible for busienss why should west remove it with 2 bullets but very poor stuffing in his suits?|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead direction dbl by E|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: its a children leave the room hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: andmaybe the grannies with weak hearts too|pg||
nt|andyv:  no one likes to follow directions|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Should have bid it louder|pg||
nt|lml: think its cold|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It told North exactly what he needed to know ... partner is void in diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And it looks like they had the GSF mechanism to diagnose the spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: also in sweden I think |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzwe: Well, if he passed south would have bid 4@D, void|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: if you say so ...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer can set up a ninth trick in hearts but cannot reach all his tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E says "top from QJT..." when Andersson ask|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: duck one club and then win ace and play third round|pg||
nt|henryb:  cold, but takes some good quessing|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has to ruff with Q and take a view|pg||
nt|henryb:  West has to play clubs before any trumps, then ruff with @hQ and run 10|pg||
nt|lml: true west has to guess that north has the @HJ and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: if the defence find the duck etc he wil llikely get that right|pg||
nt|henryb:  he might play one round of trumps first, and then he is down on best defense|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, bus pass then |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and lots of tricks it seems..|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|henryb:  now no defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: well  all our discussion very academic as usual....|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer should probably play K here because J forcing the ace is not good enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy t find a threaeting defence here|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt need to even run this now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: in which case, full credit (and then some) to the N/S methods|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is defeinitely biddable without the intervention|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: well played south|pg||
nt|andyv:  San Sac has a blitz going on this round|pg||
pc|sA|nt|golfergolf: Holland is miles from Sweden|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Al long as the defence play clubs at some point|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|nigel_k:  Sorry declarer can make by ducking this and establishing a spade later|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Due to the lucky lie of the spade spots|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: death by fire or water take ur choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: diamond finesse losing is good news for South, as it means 3NT is not on|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes many miles|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: they got to 6@H is OR on the grand slam hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: we see that the grand wasnt bid in open|pg||
nt|lml: he did use the same self splinter|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|pelu: 6@D cost 11 IMP - EW in 4@H - maded by misdefense|pg||

nt|iceking: these hands we been getting are wild|pg||
nt|othered1: Not the worse slam ever seen here.|pg||
nt|othered1: worst|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'd be in grand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they have 3 more boards|pg||
nt|mareczek: livescores|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S was helpful, but still - bravo for declarer|pg||
nt|sga1: defense slipped here on 4th trick, @s play would have avoided end play|pg||
nt|andyv:  S could have avoided this by playing the A@s at trick  4|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 9 tricks NT here|pg||
nt|jcwla: The N hand looks about average for my pds when I have the S hand.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Never see Adam misguess the Queen when it matters, only for the overtrick.|pg||
mb|1N|an|13-17|nt|sfoxa:  that's the way squeezes are working :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: without a @c lead, 6@h is cold|pg||
nt|andyv:  trick will be for NS to stay out of game although they may get pushed into it|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|iceking: cant really see how you miss slam here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5 or 7 hand, but only on @C lead. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: New philosophy, I only bid the slams that make|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so it is not really a 5 or 7 hand, is it?|pg||
nt|rnc: It looks like bad coaching from the captain. Who to blame? Me of course, since I'm the guilty one...:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  do they still playing with you, such a lucky guy? :) |pg||
nt|garnetts: Everything normal here|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 4@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: no you should play 6 on @C lead you can play @D 2 times and pich @C|pg||
nt|mareczek: dbl. = "pass or correct"|pg||
nt|mareczek: now NS in troubles|pg||
nt|mareczek: even 3@h after trump lead does not look well|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@S= neg X without @S |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but here EW should find their way to 3NT|pg||
nt|mareczek: once again strong club|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|bvdahl: yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lie of the cards is better for NS than for EW, but EW have more power|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so it goes...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, game forcing opening allows to win game in @s |pg||
nt|daman: if they manage to get to slam  it is very mekeable|pg||
nt|daman: provided they pin the doubleton 109 of @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: not familiar with n-s system here but suprising to see a 1@c and not 1@d opening|pg||
nt|ybob: they play 1@C p 1@D = no 5M|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S should consider his @h lenght as a stopper and bid game|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H bid now|pg||
nt|jcwla: Beautiful hand to lead from... meanwhile the Rabbi is busy this set.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can't imagine SO helpful hand from defence to allow declarer making it|pg||
nt|hedyg: the leaders bid 6@c as well|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't young bessis afraid he was stolen from :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S must have been embarraced a little bit|pg||
nt|mareczek: when S will show diwmond suit, will N go to the slam?|pg||
nt|kjadams: I really dislike that redouble.   your partner gives you the chance to preemt, you take it.|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think 3@s wouldwork better than rdbl|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bvdahl: so 6 is more or less 75%|pg||
nt|othered1: in 2/1, west would be 80 percent of the way to slam.  In EW''s acol style, it may not be|pg||
nt|andyv:  doing ok...lots of bridge|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D= 0-7|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 1NT any game force|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluff: preempt with 4333 ?|pg||
nt|mareczek: N knows that somebody must be joking|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Mark|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: 4@D? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D probably a fragment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or maybe just a cue bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has got one more chance to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c must be relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: yes...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lesser evil|pg||
nt|stewball: not a lot of imps in these hands so far|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like average, but each option - 10, 11 or 12 tricks - is possible |pg||
nt|kjadams: a puppet stayman auction.   Right system for these cards.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  rather not 10|pg||
nt|jcwla: Against big club if ever but in any case - what is the XX?  And still another X?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will signal for @c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and helping hand from defence looks unnatural|pg||
mb|3H|an|kort !S båda lå|nt|othered1: doesn't that normally imply shortness in 4th suit?|pg||
nt|rnc: Cue, I'm told (sitting 2 mtrs from the table)|pg||
nt|iceking: good bidding with no extras w will bid 6@H now |pg||
nt|rnc: Should be short, in my opinion|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in the CR, EW used 5 bids to get to 4@h. Here they might use less than that to arrive in slam...|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 5 bidding rounds|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a comeback for Vintage.|pg||
nt|iceking: east bidding in closed room looks just surreal |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one doesn't looks very special|pg||
nt|sharkey: should be off as dummy very short of entries.....|pg||
nt|mareczek: they have found the contract which is difficult do double|pg||
nt|mareczek: East knows that they have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mareczek: should play spade after @cA|pg||
nt|mareczek: otherwise, declarer can play @sJ|pg||
nt|mareczek: and if W will not cash the spades, EW can be in troubles|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  to create problems for declarer,N have to lead opp's suit - @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @c lead appears helpful|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would you have passed throughout as S, Sveta?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first lead well choosen - E is known to have more points than W, so N hopes to find partner with some values|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even without @c swith now, declarer has to concede 4 tricks|pg||
nt|kjadams: Running the Jack in slam would be nominated for play of the tournament|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  5@d is good as well|pg||
nt|ybob: S prefer wait to bid NT if pd has H stiff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  well done!|pg||
nt|andyv:  this has not been a very good set for Brink and Drijver while Bessis and Volcker have been flawless|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: Dont see how East can avoid @D loser|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  would have considering this option, but triple, not only twicr|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *twice, sorry|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, @s lead had worked as well|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but the most interesting point - this contract could be made|pg||
nt|mareczek: usually in this position East's bidding causes the most suspicions|pg||
nt|sga1: Hope don't get over board to 6@C|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW climbed on 3rd position - they have very good round indeed|pg||
nt|daman: cash the Ace   then run the Jack|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told "dynamic 1NT"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: now pass|pg||
mb|5C|nt|iceking: ok iam trying to see what extras W has someone help me|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good philosophy. Bid the contract that makes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @d split 3-3, one @d finess and one ruff is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If the Vintage team advance the good news for us is that Hed and Andersson will be available as operators for future broadcasts :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: If it's Rosenkranz style I dislike it with the queen (even tho that is part of the book treatment).|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a great slam|pg||
mb|7D|nt|Walddk2: Although we don't need them when we have William and Magnus. They are great!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what should be S's next move?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 of @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: or Q|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's great|pg||
nt|hedyg: Thomas is afraid of nothing :p|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10hcps out of 16 in opps suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  no dbl - no trouble, will S think seeing the dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: (every time i say that somebody tells me i am wrong and it is a wonderful slam)|pg||
nt|kjadams: But it would actually be the wrong play given no information.   QT + Q9 are twice as likely as just T9, so restricted choice would lead to misguess.|pg||
nt|daman: the "Dynamic 1NT" is a holdover from the Romex system|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  squeeze can really work, if S have been playing small @s at the first trick keeping 10@s as a menace at the table|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the hand is over before it starts|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  only @hA and @h continuation, but not here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  hands like these at least don't put a strain on declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big prize money. 1st place = $ 10,000, then 6,000, 4,000, 3,000, 2,000, 1,000. Money to 6 out of 16, not bad|pg||
nt|kjadams: Also T or 9 from T9xx is possible falsecard.|pg||
nt|daman: but with Romex it is only when you open 1NT|pg||
nt|daman: we can find many holdings to offset my premise|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnc: Don't forget there is a Consolation Cup too. But I might bench them to do the broadcasting... :):)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's strong willed of them -- I might be out the door, never to return (during this event.)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  but not this time, yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: can only get to dummy by playing @H - thus no ruff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  alas|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  helpful hand from defence?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not from this players, though|pg||
nt|sharkey: B has shown @C by X I think - S may contionue with @CK and more @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: *N|pg||
nt|kjadams: but it would be pretty to see the play :-)|pg||
nt|daman: it was just a thought ...."PROVIDED he pins the doubleton 109 of @H"|pg||
nt|kjadams: Did I hear a collective sigh of relief from the Polish fans after Easy final pass?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  start was good from both sides. let's see the next move |pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl might hurt the defense if W playes in 6@c and a low @s is led|pg||
nt|kjadams: Easts|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|andyv:  this should end matters quickly|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W have to pick up ALL his luck and "being wizard" skills from previous boards to win this contract|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible. looks like "present in return" to NS rather|pg||
nt|sga1: I  agree.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gawrys showed fit and maximum for pass with @c control|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sga1: good lead and hope continues, no switch to small @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder why J@d was not played|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if 2@d is encouraging|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it would be helpful for N who has to continue small(!) @d now|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW couldn't stay out of slam in @cs in OR either... down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @s switch?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sfoxa:  is 5 high enough to be promoted? yes, it is. |pg||
nt|8252: hi|pg||
nt|bobholl: thomas had gldly missed his @D 9 :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  first attempt to gain 9th trick failed|pg||
nt|bobholl: gladly|pg||
nt|andyv:  It seems that S made this harder than it needed to be.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kjadams: unfortunate that North did not support diamonds at some point.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  4 @d rounds force 4 discards from dummy, hence @c  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 7NT was bid twice on bd 15 so it is still a plus for EW in -1700!|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kjadams: those good hearts just too tempting.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: Q@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice play by S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|daman: :(|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good defence - didnt even get a pitch on @SK...|pg||
nt|hedyg: missed the A@S now|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gawrys had to play @s back|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: but Gino has seen this play before|pg||
nt|kjadams: now declarer may have to pitch before knowing if hearts split.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rnc: Remember that both broadcasters are in the trailing team. (And they are still alive...as far as I can see)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  unfortunately, E didn't cash 2 @s tricks before @h lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  point of truth|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W couldn't afford to cash last trump|pg||
nt|garnetts: It seems like a total guess to me|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  +1|pg||
nt|hedyg: what did you expect George?|pg||
nt|kjadams: the spade 8 being high offers safe play for 5|pg||
nt|hedyg: max for 1@d ofc sry|pg||
nt|daman: in 5?     playing the AK :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now E is endplayed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @c lead now squeezes both table and S|pg||
nt|kjadams: and guesses wrong.|pg||
mc|13|nt|bobholl: he has almost no choice|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad that W can't squeeze S|pg||

nt|andyv:  yes, very difficult hand to play|pg||
nt|andyv:  your everyday 6-6 hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: settles for 9|pg||
nt|lml: but the void hand ended up using blackwood |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ie the wrong hand took control|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: good slam here|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  Maybe S with the best hand will not even find a bid here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5 ot 7@h - or? on a @c lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: only lead to threaten 6@h is a club although here nothing beats it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would love to open the N hand |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: On 17, a spec was asking why playing the spades ace was needed, if you glance at the excellent defence in the other room you will see why... the more I look at it the better that ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of spades play seems|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@hs doesn't make on @c lead and @s switch (if N is playing it)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jillan:  he found one I wouldn't have|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 2D is natural, despite W showing 4+|pg||
nt|jillan:  who would Dbl now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: with one of my partners, I could....2@d (6-10 hcp, 4+@D, 5-card major) |pg||
nt|sybarra: W passing anything  and everything |pg||
mb|3C!|nt|jillan:  Not the best contract me thinks|pg||
nt|pelu: but on a @C-lead u wont to be in /@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: east's hand pretty powerful opp a strong club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: san sac is leading this district, and last hand is good example of why|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 7@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  E taking out insurance|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: 2@H is bold|pg||

nt|lestergold: vul it wouldbe a disgrace|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: yes! all about @sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but its not agood 7@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is N permitted ot hit the deck?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or if playing muiderberg,  2 @H =5 hts and 4(+) minor|pg||
nt|golfergolf: I could, 2@H, 5@H, 4+m|pg||
nt|lestergold: even at equal its very dangerous witgh such an awful suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: No but not 6@h either, because you have to rely on a @s finess after a @c lead. so 5 or 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and N buying more collision insurance|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: in 6@H and a @C-lead u could first play @DA and @DQ to discard a @C - so 6@h ned one af the kings onside|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will play Q@c|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  or maybe J@c|pg||
nt|henryb:  this looks a little embarrassing for N-S: 12 tops and a 13th in @d|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: so almost 75%|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@h is a with odds slam because ona non club lead its cold and on a club lead you have the option of disposing of the club loser by a guess in 1ds as well as the sapde finesse so ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: id say well more than 505 slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not Dbl on 4@c?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not that it really matters here, but I'm not keen on leading @H2 from 7542|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzwe: Because he will be on lead against a heart slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: really 75%? you can play @d on 2 ways and if it loses, @sK must be on side.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this seems underbid - 7@D looks on |pg||
pc|c5|nt|nigel_k:  Hard to blame North for taking the phantom with a 6-6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: flew too high towards the Sun|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: looks like only -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the trump break doesnt help |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wouldn't it be more normal to lead the @H7 or @h5?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was thinking the same|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Trump promotion now for down 2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: adn that is on a club lead which makes the slam pretty enormous|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: the normalplay will be the ruffing finess in @D - if no King u discard the @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: you would have to take the ruffing finesse of course to preserve the doubole chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: a pitch for a ht |pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think N had any right to bid 5@h... his pd dbld 5@c|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: many players in England (certainly in the London leaues) would respond 1NTas West |pg||

nt|andyv:  and a push at both tables|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think you can always bid with extra shape and the double just says it is our hand |pg||
nt|vbman: a grand?|pg||
nt|lml: those are the 2 big hands this set so far and they both went Mach's way|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we expected|pg||

nt|vugraphzwe: 2@d - 2@h followed by 3@c slaminvitational with @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly artificial relay to 2@hA, then 3@c nat fg? |pg||

nt|mdgraham: breaks are not kind here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: no question..|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a savage layout for e/w as they bid to an unmakeable game somewhere|pg||
nt|lml: the auction might suggest that things arent splitting|pg||
nt|lml: but it is hard to avoid game with 26HCP|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: This is  good hand for Lebensohl ... North bids 2NT, then signs off in 3@H over 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the tenth trump is useful |pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 26 counts reach game except in bidding compes|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: absolutely no card wasted|pg||
nt|sybarra: with trumps 2/1,  easy  |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: thanks William|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  you have a bit to handle and perhaps it needs some good breakes - but they are almost all there|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 3S and 4C are cuebids|pg||
nt|mdgraham: something for NS to look at then, missing the diamond fit |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: And N/S are in tune with that comment|pg||
nt|lestergold: er|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vbman: needs a cl singleton from s hand with cards closed|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm east warned west|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: ending in something doubled|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: west coudlnt get passed the 5-5 but this will be no fun|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  N will not be happy with how the suits split|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double of 3@s must suggest penalty surely|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: I hope no one thinks their partner has shown the @DA|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that heart lead this is off|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: I wonder what 1@h-2NT-4@C would be. If that is a splinter the South hand would be huge|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|chick: ouch, exactly :(|pg||
nt|jillan:  I think both thinks the other one has...|pg||
nt|chick: This is of course the danger in cuebidding first OR second round controls|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: This is why they invented Blackwood|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vbman: there|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently they already knew club singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: 4@c = void|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: good observation Magnus, N could have asked keycards after 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: S says he thinks N had a void in D when he didn't ask for aces|pg||
nt|vbman: but needs 13th trick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: Haven't seen 4NTx for a while :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: from the fryimng pan.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defended 5NTxx a few years back|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT probably makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyhone knowm what they would lead?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: well declarer has a pretty good idea about how the cards lie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes....badly|pg||
nt|henryb:  If it is slam invitational with clubs I think North undervalued his hand. The @cQJ become BIG CARDS and outside that he is all prime with controls in all suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: he could have bid 3@d as 4-cards|pg||
nt|henryb:  really!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vbman: thats the 6th trump|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|lestergold: unless error|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: well that is not the best line....|pg||
nt|lml: if he worked out how the clubs lay which he might have he probably has a shot at 1 down|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: no error|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2NT is four-card support, North could have "lied" about holding the @hQ |pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: still, it's a good bidding test to get to seven|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: do we agree with that way of handling hearts|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not particularly, but we certainly don't agree with taking the diamond finesse prior to testing the clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That was a genuine blunder|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because if clubs are 3-3, he doesn't need the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: i dont see that|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Not a good result but could easily be flat|pg||
nt|andyv:  not the type of result N signed up for when he opened the hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@d a good spot|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|vugraphzwe: 2D is 11-16 with short diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|jillan:  2@S anyone|pg||

nt|lml: brb|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: if you had a bid to show both majors, would you use it, or would you just bid 2@S?|pg||

nt|jillan:  NOT right |pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  if it is I am crosseyed|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: do you folk pass with that south hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no - 1@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for the lead, and all that|pg||
mb|4D|nt|nigel_k:  Yes East has a lot extra|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|andyv:  wonder if 6@d shows 1 king|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard for W to bid much more... E has not shown his length yet|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: pretty auto for 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and it cant fail|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Innovative contract, but the breaks are poor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West can't really count 13 tricks as partner could have x Kx AKJxxx xxxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  playing specific kings|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even then you need a 4-3 spade break to make 12|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW made the difficult 5 clubs in OR will be disappointed to be -9 on the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  It is the seventh diamond and third heart that make it good|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, that is why I think E needed to jump to 7 level|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: we can see all cards, so much easier, but a @s lead is ´more attractive for me than a @d|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|chick: nor I|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|an|5-5 minors/ choose game|nt|sybarra: same lead as I recall |pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: In USA a lot of people play 1n-3h or 3s shows N hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is it at all tempting to double the 2 hearts with west..?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: no double of 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@h = 10+ @S-bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  another good result for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would have bid 2NT with the E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: or are we replaying this hand?  |pg||
nt|henryb:  NO|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|chick: If S follows through and leads a @H, this will be difficult to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: You have to play on D 3-3 for 1 down|pg||
nt|chick: N has 3 entries and S stops the remaining suit|pg||
nt|jillan:  avoid 4@S here, 3NT seems the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  especially not if this is the way they get to 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This might get NBS Lind onto the score card|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I don't have a problem upgrading East, but you know that suits are not breaking and partner has passed so it is quite easy for them to balance|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the 10s, esp. the major suit ones, the hand evaluates to a little better than 15.5 hcp|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So I think it pays for East to be a bit stronger than usual in this situation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well played!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be something systemic here - South removing 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, both minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|henryb:  For the record, both N-S pairs play this unusual use of 2@d which I have never seen before|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: at the other table i think they play "sunderlin" not the same as this one|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: bet he did, if South is there with 2@h|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: seem s odd that north is silent with 17 count and south is protecting with a couple of quacks|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|harmon: down to 11|pg||
nt|harmon: or 12 |pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: at the other table 3@h bid showed singelton 3@s 9 cards minors|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: Yes magnus, but E will probably play for splitted @c honours|pg||
nt|chick: oops, there goes the plan for -1 :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|golfergolf: 300 it will be|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: well if this the real auction I am surprised north didn't bid 4@H over 2@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wilkinsona: that diamond duck seems a nec. precaution|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is going to make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: -2 is still better than 3@H making though|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Can S really have a club honour after the overcall?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzwe: E didn't like that N discarded|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: the grand slam hand (bid to six here) was played in 4@h next door|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after a 2@H opening|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzwe: went to fast, he made it|pg||
nt|sybarra: that N hand is too good for 2 @H unless you are playing some intermediate 2 |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 21|pg||
nt|vbman: cant recover if he plays a royal|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: an overcall on a 10-high suit, too|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ahd to try a @d|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzwe: singelton @h,3@s and 9 cards in minors|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
mc|12|nt|lml: it didnt cost anything|pg||
nt|harmon: thats makes auction easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: indeed|pg||

nt|vugraphzwe: @dT lead -promisse higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  There must be some mysterious reason that North cannot be properly punished for entering the auction|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: can you imagine comparison?  +400,  "we passed it out" |pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzwe: my pleasure :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 22 flat, it seems|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm north  alittlemore optimistic than open room counterpart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "What did they go eight off in?"|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks normal to reach layout unfrioendly|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: 6@C is quite a good contract - basically, you just need to organize two heart ruffs, and it's doable|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
pc|s8|nt|golfergolf: Nice to be with yoy, my first time on comment|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess this is how South runs with a one suited hand|pg||

nt|lml: its going to be close|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: You're on the way Germ!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They rather seem to be on THEIR way as well (N/S)|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead may let this thru|pg||
nt|lml: the spot cards are kind of working for south|pg||
nt|henryb:  And here I was thinking that it should be unnecessary to reach 3N with a misfitting combined 24 count|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: declarferf can make 2@s 4 @hs 2 @d and a club|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
nt|lestergold: should do when he can tell that a club is going tio be estabklushed and has indeed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks William|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think the next match is in 40 minutes or so |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must admit that after 4@h by West nothing would stop me as East |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in about 25 min (or before) |pg||
nt|sybarra: scheduled time is 5:55 am Los Angeles, 8:55 am New York, 14.55 Paris, 1:55 pm London|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: with 6 and 5 card suits about and fair inermediates i think 3n is normal|pg||
nt|lml: the @C9 and S!9 were big cards|pg||
nt|lml: thats why they bid it|pg||
nt|lml: @S9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: next set due to start shortly|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are definitely making it and another good one for Mach|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so team Mach win, congrats to them|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|chick: Thanks to Jill Mellstrom and Ralf Willquist for their excellent commentary :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  see ya all in 20|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: E had a difficult bid, D may loose the 5-3 heart fit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: Great stuff - their slam bidding has been superb this set|pg||
nt|golfergolf: In no time|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have done a bit of ducking|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: looks like 2nt asked second suit, as it would in forcing stayman|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So win the club and play a heart, win the club continuation, and you can easily ruff two hearts high, using @DK and @SA as entries for the last heart ruff and to draw the last ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Yes, that's true, they have given up the game-try and instead they try to make it easier to bid to the best game/slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: duck the first spade and duck the first heart when it comes|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Yes, 16:35 local time|pg||
