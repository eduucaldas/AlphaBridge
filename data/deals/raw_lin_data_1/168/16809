mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: come to that, can they beat four hearts?|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  @h lead best as cards lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but West may score a @c ruff to make up the club trick lost on the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: @CQ   is an interesting lead|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the -2 in OR came when South didn't have trump control to set up a long club trick|pg||
nt|dburn: he may, but this lead may also have lost a tempo - declarer would have problems keeping control on a heart lead|pg||
nt|mamos: (is fearless the code?)|pg||

nt|toobad: good to see Richard thinking about best defence|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|idc: Well, no UCB 2@d by partner, so it is a little pushy|pg||
nt|dburn: facing three trumps to the queen and clubs headed by A10 or K10, game would have reasonable play|pg||

mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|idc: If that's a weak 2, I doubt I'd do anything but pass as East|pg||
nt|idc: Hi Julian|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Nice Maior he has|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Becky must have seen how well the cards lie!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (sorry)|pg||
nt|mamos: and 3NT is not a good idea  (even if it makes)|pg||
nt|idc: Naughty step for you Roland if we have any more of those puns|pg||
nt|idc: The cards certainly do lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s is weak but max is 11|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wales have a complete dearth of juniors such that they have had to make an U25 side out of their U25s and U20s. Accordingly, no Wales in the Peggy Bayer (U20)|pg||
nt|idc: That explains the enquiry from East then|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am not sure whether this pair could play in U20s|pg||
nt|idc: for many Juniors, an 11 count is an average strength 1 opening :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Harris-Richards could play U20s this year|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  for results|pg||
nt|idc: I guess West is thinking of coming again, holding 6-4 shape|pg||
nt|idc: looks like both 4@s and 5@d are making too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think it must be a connection problem|pg||
nt|idc: I used to have partners with connection problems - between their bids and their actual hands|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West may have been thinking but not this long|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: Im afraid that Juniors learn from their olders and not betters :)|pg||
