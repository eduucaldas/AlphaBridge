nt|rnc: Convention card for E/W available at: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc11/fc_main_en.htm - then look under Convention Cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n not an easy contract to defend of course|pg||

nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: The reason is that N lead a spade from hand out of turn|pg||

nt|golfergolf: in OR|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Just proves the power of my predictions.  I thought both teams would get to 6@S.  But no: one 7@S and one 4@S ...|pg||

nt|bjacobs: And thanks too to my fellow commentators, Martin and Germ|pg||
nt|golfergolf: 6@C posible|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation goes to the SBF's Ostra Mellansvenska District  and Carl Ragnarsson (South at this table) for putting on the show|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 6@C is quite a good contract - basically, you just need to organize two heart ruffs, and it's doable|pg||
mb|4C|nt|golfergolf: Nice to be with yoy, my first time on comment|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now west must find that @d switch to beat this|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Great stuff - their slam bidding has been superb this set|pg||
nt|golfergolf: In no time|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: looks like 2nt asked second suit, as it would in forcing stayman|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So win the club and play a heart, win the club continuation, and you can easily ruff two hearts high, using @DK and @SA as entries for the last heart ruff and to draw the last ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzwe: Yes, that's true, they have given up the game-try and instead they try to make it easier to bid to the best game/slam|pg||
