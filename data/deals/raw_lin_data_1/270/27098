nt|Walddk2: Now he remembered that he has a plane to catch|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|andyv:  several ask about 3@d...not sure what their agreement is in regards to that bid|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|cuan: Also Multon-Fissore in 3NT on board 6. The correct bid was (in that board) : 1@H - 2@C - 2@D - 2@S - 3@S - 4@S (3@S on a 4th suit means : i have four spades)|pg||
mc|10|nt|cuan: bye for now, see you later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is not laydown on a club lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer must play spades early to prevent a club ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, and even on invite S probably owuld not accept.|pg||
nt|cuan: at what time the next round ?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Another opportunity for Israel, as 3NT and 4@H can both make. Not so easy to bid though|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|davidb: now a nice pen !|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidb: why  not X  S?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|SFoxa:  may be, first X emphasized majors?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that 4@H goes down on a club lead. That is not correct, as declarer can knock out East's entry by playing spades first|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|nilsland:  Are all doubles for PEN when you have passed over 1NX - this is a difficult question|pg||

nt|nilsland:  this looks like 2 dwn|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I like the Fantunes treatment, where 2@C after the 1NT response shows majors. It's also logical, as responder has clubs on this auction|pg||

nt|davidb: yes  |pg||
