nt|ritong: rumor has it gus created it|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 1@C is either 9-13hcp any hand|pg||
nt|athene: is there any documentation around for NS system?|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: and 1@d, 1@h, 1@s openings are 14+ hcp|pg||
nt|thorvald:  We hear you loud and clear|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: No -- I have just asked NS -- and I will try to keep up |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D could be Montreal Relay style - i.e. denying a 5-card major|pg||
nt|thorvald:  3@D seems to be the top spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: W asks about the 1@d bid -- S says its natural|pg||
nt|athene: the hand looks a bit strong for it to be a negative|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|thorvald:  Krogh is one of the sponsors for this excellent tournament|pg||
nt|ritong: if 1@c is 9/13, tom might have intended to pass any bid by his part|pg||
nt|thorvald:  a @C ruff|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald:  West forgot that partner was a passed hand, |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|thorvald:  Much better to double at pairs|pg||
nt|athene: at love-all it's certainly right to compete quite vigorously, but 4-over-3 looks a bit much with that west hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|athene: double gets 300 if you find the club ruff|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|Walddk2:  http://www2.bridge.dk/TournamentInformation.aspx?ID=6082  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: remember 1@c is any 9-13 hcp hand|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so the NS system seems to be "open 1@C every hand" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: in the NS system -- (invented by Gus Hansen) -- I am told|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: what do they do with 14+ hcp and clubs? 1@C as well, or 2@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: open 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: either a 9-13 or 14+ with @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: i think gus will prefer open his long suits when he s grown up|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ritong: for the time being, he discovers the game|pg||
nt|athene: i'm sure he intends to show the hearts at a later date|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: sure he will -- 3@h -- anyone for a bet :)?|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I had promised to do written.|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 3@d is explained as weak with a lot of @ds -- tells S to West|pg||
nt|gravity: all in for pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but his partner making a weak jump shift might be one of the things that dissuades him actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: actually a good contract -- isnt it?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|athene: 3@S would have had fair chances too|pg||
nt|athene: i mean 3@S is decent looking at the EW cards only|pg||
nt|thorvald:  tops pot is 4@SX so this is better|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: according to my double dummy the pair contract is 4@d making|pg||

nt|athene: but in 4, you play them from the top|pg||

nt|athene: at other tables it might start P 1@H 1@S 2@D and now east gets the spade raise in|pg||
nt|athene: so i would imagine there will be some EW pairs bidding 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Results after each round will be posted here: http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Startliste1384.html|pg||

nt|ritong: the scoresheet on that one may be difficult to predict, though|pg||

nt|athene: this 1@C opener is going to come up a LOT|pg||
nt|athene: so opps really need to know what they are doing over it|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: it is Match Point scoring in the Pro-Am -- in the main event it is imps|pg||

mb|3C|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald:  79% for Gus and Tom in first round|pg||
nt|athene: i think a reasonable agreement over this 1@C is X = a 1@C opener, everything else as normal|pg||
nt|athene: west really hasn't done justice to his hand|pg||

nt|athene: i think east has a 14 count you might open 1nt either 12-14 OR 15-17|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: because it is right on the borderline, and there is a tactical advantage in opening 1nt|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: now of course declarer has 11 on top so he won't take a club finesse|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|thorvald:  He can only see 10|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|thorvald:  sry, 11|pg||
nt|ritong: surprising line|pg||
nt|athene: that was odd play - doesn't he have 4 spades 4 diamonds 1 club and 2 hearts?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: so after he has lost the @HA he is playing for the rest|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: ideally he wants to cash the @HJ and then run winners ending in hand, making 12 if the @H10 falls or south is squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: but he didn't have the entries for that|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: but just cash the @HJ would have worked|pg||
nt|athene: club finesse only works when south has both and doesn't split|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Next round in 3 minutes -- David Gold from Great Britain will be the Pro -- with Nadia Koch that have paid about 250 Euro to play with David|pg||

nt|athene: good result for NS, since EW can get another trick if they attack clubs|pg||
nt|thorvald:  Its AM/AM now |pg||
nt|ritong: and have play in 3@c too|pg||
nt|athene: it's not impossible west might find a 2@C raise if the auction begins 1@C (X) at other tables|pg||
nt|athene: then the lead is easier|pg||
nt|thorvald:  They did buy the last place :-)|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt opener from east might shut NS out altogether, of course|pg||
nt|athene: hard to get into 4-4 fits over opposing 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose north might balance with a major-showing bid|pg||

mb|1D|nt|vugraphzce: 1@d is 4+@d and 14+hcp|pg||
nt|ritong: in a standard pardship 2@h by east would be natural here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: assuming north bids them, naturally|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: now 2@h is natural for the whole planet|pg||
mb|3H|nt|smoller:  now its on my table, I shall try to find out what !@S is|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Gus Hansen has played a real bridge tournament in Moscow once -- a real competitive one that is -- with Martin Schaltz|pg||
nt|thorvald:  3@H is a guessing bid|pg||
nt|athene: quite an interesting point of bidding - east might be worried NS have a club fit and so tries to shut them out|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: NS plays Doubles above 2@cs as a penalty dbl|pg||
nt|athene: if he had a singleton spade, and he was worried they had a spade fit, there would be less reason to try a jump, because you probably aren't shutting spades out anyway - south will ...|pg||

pc|hT|nt|athene: most would overcall 1@H with south surely|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: still, passing worked out well when west decided that clubs would make a better trump suit than spades|pg||

nt|athene: south was marked with @CKQ on the bidding apart from anything|pg||
nt|athene: (with @CK north opens 1@C)|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: a grand slam -- but will the pro-am partnership bid it ?|pg||

nt|athene: i mean given that west passes the double|pg||
nt|thorvald:  I think he will pass|pg||
