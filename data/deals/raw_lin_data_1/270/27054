nt|Walddk2: What about Oz, Peter?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: One of the defensive aces vanished in the other room. Again, no big deal at IMP scoring|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 3@S usually played as 3-1-5-4 or 3-1-4-5|pg||
nt|petergill: The vulnerability deterred South from bidding. |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Same with 3@H and a heart singleton, then 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: W is thinking about bidding here|pg||
nt|petergill: @D lead or switch --->|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: and that could be very wrong -- if S leads a @d with singleton @h -- would you do that?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1NT was 14-16 at the other table, so Roy Welland did not investigate slam|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe, but does declarer then have enough entries to pick up North's hearts = yes|pg||
nt|petergill: After his 1345/1354 3@S bid, Ventin has assumed that partner has no wasted cards in spades, a false assumption|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: South knows from the auction that partner has either a key card or @HQ or both, else 6@H would have been bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Now S asks about the bidding -- and it seems that EW have had a bidding misunderstanding|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: W thinks that 4@h is a good minor raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: and E thinks its natural|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: If the opponents think they are close in assets to 6@H, as the auction suggests, then attacking with @SA or @D lead looked best|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: actually her choices were 1N and 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their opening bids of 1@D/@H/@S are unbalanced|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 1@C covers all balanced hands [including 2@C and ANY 5-card suit] that are out of range of NT openings|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Marion Michielsen|pg||
nt|petergill: I much prefer Welland - Auken's auction on Bd 2 - showing 1345 with the singleton KING in my view was misguided |pg||
nt|lady007:  hi all|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Marion|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Hi Marion - welcome |pg||
nt|lady007:  yes i also think 1N-3N was better|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: dbl = 4+@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Again a slightly misunderstanding by EW|pg||
nt|lady007:  it seems that EW have another bidding misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 2@d meant as GF|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|lady007:  did east intend 2@d as GF?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|lady007:  yes. he tried to set up a GF and ask about his partners spade holding|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Welland - Auken did well at the other table to right-side the spades, putting @HAQ in declarer's hand, but the unlucky @D position doomed their 4@S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps Ventin might be jetlagged. Does he live in Spain or Argentina? i.e. did he have a long flight to Copenhagen|pg||
nt|lady007:  I think Ventin-Wrang play a Swedish version of the transfer responses to the 1@c opening. Most of the Swedish play a 2@h bid after a 1@h overcall from the opponents as a GF with 5+@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no reason why the XY-NT convention should not apply on this auction in my view|pg||
nt|lady007:  I'm not sure if Wrang had that option or if he decided not to , with a 64|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Two Way Checkback Stayman|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|nt|lady007:  well, west has probably denied a 3rd spade already (then he would bid 1@s instead of 1N)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 3 - Wrang did not play 2@d as well as he should have - for a start, he should have ducked Trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 2@c is Hexan|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: a sort of Gazzilli - I think :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Häxan is a Swedish variation of Gazzilli|pg||

nt|vugraphzce: We will be back in 12 minutes --- bye|pg||
nt|lady007:  south could still have defeated it by leading a club, but that was very dangerous from 10x with no trumps to ruff anything|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes Marion, if EW are not playing trasnfers, EW would have to try to land in 3NT, not 4@S|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes, 3NT was by far the best contract, but you cant really blame west for trying for a spade contract|pg||
nt|petergill: A (tiny, possibly irrelevant) counter-argument in favour of the club lead over the @d lead is that if the hearts lie as they do, you are in a rush to get N in, and North with (most ...|pg||
nt|petergill: likely) more clubs than @D's is more likely to have an entry (e.g. ace) in @C than @D |pg||
