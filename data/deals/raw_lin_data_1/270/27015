nt|mug: and Robertson's hand was slam-going facing any voluntary 4@D bid|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|mug: yes I would have raised to the 3-level on the West hand on general principles|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|mug: I wonder if 3@C is forcing or not|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: it's a bit good to be non forcing so I guess forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: Thomas Paske will have to be straight in with his @DA to cash spades against 3NT|pg||
nt|mug: otherwise it will make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is he considering X or 4@H|pg||
nt|mug: I suppose the answer is "yes"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: What would x be?  Lead a @H or Lead a @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how do you play those doubles of 3NT?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: this is for a heart in my book|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: I dont suppose they will block the @S suit|pg||
nt|mug: now declarer has a choice, should he try to slip a diamon past early doors, or rattle of six rounds of clubs and hope for spade discards?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Would you run the clubs first and hope they discard the wrong thing?|pg||
nt|mug: it comes down to taking a view about the opponent's capabilities|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6 rounds of clubs won't be very comfortable for NS |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mug: but South should work it out when North throws a load of hearts |pg||
nt|mug: and South will be throwing his too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|mug: a different ruse here, declarer is pretending he needs @DJ as entry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: earlier a duck could have let in 3NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, clever leading K|pg||
nt|mug: doesn't really stack up but if it works who cares|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does 6@D mean i wonder|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 7|pg||
nt|mug: could well be some version of Smith|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it showing count, or a smith peter saying something about the @H suit|pg||
nt|mug: Paske can't really hope for Robertson to stop clubs, so I think he's looking at six club tricks and @HAK for declarer|pg||
nt|paulg:  in principle they play count|pg||
nt|mug: so the diamond will be the ninth, he can't afford to duck it|pg||
nt|mug: most likely what he's pondering is which spade to shift to|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: even if he wins this will have to play the spades with care|pg||

nt|mug: now declarer has the rest for +1150|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it A for attitude i wonder|pg||
nt|mug: whatever the ace meant, the queen tells the story, and other card is a blunder|pg||
