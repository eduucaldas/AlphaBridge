nt|athene: 5@D is good because west has @DJxxx|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzce: NS system (in brief): 1@c opening is 9-13 ANY HAND or 14+ with @cs. 1@d, 1@h and 1@s is 14+ and 1nt opening is 18+ ..|pg||
nt|athene: tough decision for north here - to cover or not to cover?|pg||
nt|athene: if south has @CQ105, it looks silly not to cover|pg||
nt|athene: but if the lead is a singleton it is helping declarer|pg||

nt|athene: this is quite a common bidding error - making the rebid you had planned to make when you opened, when it's no longer appropriate|pg||
nt|athene: for example 1@D (1@S overcall) pass (pass) and now you often see opener rebidding 1nt with balanced minimum|pg||
