Anyway I agree that Imps-across are much better - or even better calculation the 8 boards as 9 matches|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 1@d = 0-7 hcp or GF without a 4+card Major|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  most productive is for N to pass|pg||
nt|thorvald:  Blitzing opps count to much in imps across - again worse in a tournament with different levels of players|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Henryb:  You could convert the cross-imp totals to VP for each match, particularly if you use the new WBF VP table, where each imp has a value|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  why 2N rather than 1N?|pg||
nt|thorvald:  Yes, that is a good idea, I will bring that forward to the organizers for the next tournament (as I hope it will be repeated again in 2 years)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: 2@h = @ss|pg||

nt|thorvald:  Yes, sounds right to me|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald:  South could probably have bid directly on the 4-level so is now showing a slammish hand. So North can bid 4 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: N explains that S has shown a slaminvitational hand with 6+@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: and does not understand why S passed 4nt|pg||

nt|smoller:  @SQx in North would be very valuabe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4N maybe|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: not sure if Fallenius has way to make mild slam try in @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D probably forces 4@H  [end signal]|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but 4N follow-up is ???   different for different relay pairs|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: often  Strong Quantitative |pg||

nt|vugraphzcf: No screens|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using the 4@D EndSignal  relayers can differentiate   weak quantitative raise from strong quant  because  3N-4N or 3N-4@D-4@H-4N|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Steve Robinson]|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Direct finesse since  x    Qxxx is more likely than   Q   xxxx|pg||
nt|smoller:  correct to finesse without takibg as top first|pg||
nt|smoller:  _taking a top card first|pg||
