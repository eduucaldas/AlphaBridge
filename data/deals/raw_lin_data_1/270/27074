mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: 1NT there would show 18+ since Nunes has denied 7|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|BridgeGoth: I am told E/W play Raptor so E is showing a strong NT here|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Now Nunes shows about 6 with this X|pg||

mb|2C|nt|nilsland:  This was a good board for Sweden against Real. 1NTXX made in open, 2@SX made in closed :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|BridgeGoth: Helgemo went for 500, Fantunes will need to collect at least that much to keep their lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: A spec has pointed out, in 10 boards, neither side has played the same contract on any board!|pg||
mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: Well that will do it. No Double No Trouble they say.|pg||
