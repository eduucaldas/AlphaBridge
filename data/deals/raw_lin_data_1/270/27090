mb|2N|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: and the tactical 2nt :)|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Now that the spade fit has been established, it's a 10 tricks for each side game|pg||

mb|4S|nt|vugraphzce: no alert of 2nt given at the table|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  LOL|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  So he didn't avoid the last guess!|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: No alert of 2nt given at the table -- so I cant tell you what Peter Fredin meant when he bid 2nt -- sorry|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  I can:|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: but it didnt give him the chance to aviod the last guess -- so far|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  I like to bid and mess up things|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  What makes this hard for Fredin is the vulnerability|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  And he does not know that partner has the crucial fourth heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: and often Peter Fredin has got huge success messing things up for the opponents -- but this time he did it to himself|pg||

nt|bilde:  kibbitzers suggest a club lead from Dennis, but my guess is he will lead something else: |pg||
nt|bilde:  he knows they probably have all the aces|pg||
nt|sommer: @S lead will normally set it..any other lead is =, I think!!|pg||

pc|s6|nt|sommer: well, Dennis, well done|pg||
nt|bilde:  as guessed:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..1st hurdle|pg||
nt|sommer: ..next hurdle (for NS) is to get @HQ home|pg||
nt|sommer: ..it's the best %-age play for sure to go down|pg||
nt|bilde:  the reason why he might think that they have all the aces is that it may be unlikely that they bid slam on a 4-4 fit missing both one ace and the queen of hearts|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sommer: ..(maybe a good idea too, to chose 3rd and not 5th @S??)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
