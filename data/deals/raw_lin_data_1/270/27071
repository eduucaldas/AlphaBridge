mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: EW will NOT duplicate the Hagen-Konow relay sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  A reasonable 6@s (or even 6@h)|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both Askgaard-Bjarnarson and Hagen-Konow play a version of Viking Precision|pg||

nt|Henryb:  slam makes, but it is only about 54%|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  any bid by east asking SOUTH what he has in spades leads to the winning slam ;-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe the problem was focus on @S and outside shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: so the "card-dealer" is to blame|pg||

nt|vugraphzcf: EV plays relayprecsion|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|an|1A of 3|nt|JanM:  Now presumably Hagen will be able to find out about keycards? Seems right to bid the slam, just have to decide which suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|JanM:  And then it will depend on which @s honor declarer (guess that will be Konow) plays first|pg||
nt|JanM:  Do we know what 4@d and 4@h meant? Asking in diamonds or number of keycards?|pg||
nt|JanM:  Or something else?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|an|1K of 3|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't know the system in detail|pg||
nt|vugraphzcf: I explain the bidding in the box|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's like Viking Club, as played by Grøtheim-Tundal among others|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I believe Grøtheim and Sontag wrote a book about it|pg||
nt|thorvald:  Use mouse over at the bidding to see the explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzcf: So 4@h 1A and 5@c 1 K|pg||
nt|ritong: now north will appear short in @hs, therefore more likely to be long in @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: for that reason playing in @hs is better|pg||
nt|JanM:  So 4@d was keycard for hearts, 4@h showed 1, 4NT asked about side kings and 5@c showed 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzcf: No, E didn't know the trumf suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcf: NS are asking about the bidding|pg||
pc|h4|nt|JanM:  Oh, so was it double keycard? Or straight Blackwood (just Aces)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcf: Just Aces|pg||
nt|thorvald:  Straight|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|thorvald:  This is all about the @ss|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: likely to get spades right once north shows heart shortage|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c7|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|thorvald:  He will get it right|pg||
nt|ady: in that way 6@H turns out better thn 6@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Restricted Choice, he'll get it right|pg||
nt|ady: therwe is restricted choise both ways   but the heart shortage leads to the right way|pg||
nt|JanM:  With hearts 4-1, declarer will probably get the spades right, playing for N to be more likely to have 3 than South, but maybe there are other clues we're missing, so we'll have to wait and see. One thing for sure, it won't be fast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice|pg||
nt|ritong: konow might wonder why south did not lead a singleton @s|pg||
nt|thorvald:  Even if it wasn't a restricted choice the @hs 4-1 changes odds to finess for a queen if it was Qxxx msiing|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would Zia lead a singleton into declarer's known 6-card suit?|pg||
nt|ritong: this is an element|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The fact that he did not does not change anything|pg||
nt|ritong: it still has to be taken into consideration|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  the double finesse in spades works just fine - AQ10 over the 2 spade bidder is huge|pg||

nt|thorvald:  As BBO only is recording from 2 tables we are showing this as a teams match - 8 other boards to compare with|pg||
nt|JanM:  Zia and Brogeland have played a few times before, but aren't a regular partnership, which always makes it hard to know what partner means by things - for instance, here, would 4@h by Zia show 4-5 in the Majors?|pg||

nt|Henryb:  both seven card suits got raised! How often foes that happen?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tactically when holding 0@S  is it best to do something OTHER than jump to 4@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for instance  3@D or maybe soft step with 3@H|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: seems like the "par-contract" 4@s D minus 1|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Easts double may save the pair from a phantom save|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  West has played it slow - will he back his partner's saying to defend? Hard with that hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  it should show that some of his strength is in spades|pg||

pc|cT|nt|Henryb:  4@s is an interesting contract: I think W has to shift to a club at trick 2 to beat it on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|JanM:  By bidding 3@h, West let North show that he expected to make 4@s, so could judge to save in 5@h - he couldn't know that North was being overly optimistic |pg||
