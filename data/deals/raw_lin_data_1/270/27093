nt|vugraphzce: two fast boards to start this round|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  The most important thing is to agree what it means|pg||
nt|JanM:  Shall we start asking the bridge gods to give us some more interesting hands? Or take a poll on how many Passouts there will be on 23?|pg||

nt|JanM:  Nice results :). I'm happy to see my husband's teammates have moved into first :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but more going to  DBL of weak raise = takeout   DBL of invite raise = lead direct|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|pelu:  2NT: 22-24|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 4/5@S, not 4@H|pg||
nt|JanM:  Maybe he thought that 3@c would be more useful than destructive for the opponents, and at equal vul there often isn't as much to be gained as at favorable. Another hand where it will be interesting to see what others do|pg||
nt|JanM:  The 3rd seat opener, I mean|pg||
nt|pelu:  too late again Al, I have to look in CC - u have it just on your fingers :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Lars Blakset also passed in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: after pass - pass|pg||
nt|JanM:  Thanks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess 3@S = exactly 3-fit|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: with 4-fit either cue at 4-level or bid game|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  I have read the books saying that you should pass as south in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  But come on, you play to have fun, right?|pg||
nt|JanM:  Was 3@c asking for a 5 card Major, Al? And if it was, what's 4@h?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no 3@C forced 3@D  so Sabine described without Welland answering until 3@S|pg||
nt|JanM:  At any rate, after a somewhat confusing auction, they're where we'd expect, in 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 4@h was "optional keycard" says Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  The Ace Asking Bid - I love it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 3@s was exactly 3@ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW convention card online at  http://www2.bridge.dk/Participants.aspx?ID=6885|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  To the non-Danes: EW recently bid 6 hands in the Danish Bridge Magazine (Danske Bridge)...|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  ...and used optional key card ask in ALL six of them!|pg||
nt|JanM:  When dummy comes down, Welland may be thinking he wishes he's in 6, and I guess if he guesses spades he can make 6|pg||

nt|JanM:  But look at what's happened here - after another spade, North can lead a diamond and declarer can't get to dummy to pick up the long spade, so I think North will be able to ruff the 4th diamond and there will only be 11 tricks|pg||

nt|JanM:  With North having both pointed aces, he can't successfully shift to clubs before declarer sets up the heart Q to pitch her second club|pg||

nt|vugraphzce: they are Jespers teammates in the Danish 1. division|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  :)|pg||
nt|JanM:  Good shift - if she ducks, South can shift to clubs while North still has the spade A. And if N had the Heart K, she'd have to duck|pg||

nt|Henryb:  that is if the @hK is won and a club shift|pg||

nt|JanM:  Welland's 1@c opening can be either balanced or clubs, usually that would mean either club or diamond length, and Auken could raise whichever minor it is, but with the addition of a possible 5 card Major, I'm not sure what her options are|pg||

nt|JanM:  It would have been better to be able to find clubs, so when they're considering whether the wrinkle of allowing major suit length for the 1@c opening, they have to consider hands like this. |pg||

nt|jesperdall:  setting up the clubs|pg||

nt|JanM:  Whenever you're thinking about designing a bidding system, you have to balance the gains and the losses - they're gaining by promising a shaped hand for a 1M opening, losing on hands like this. It's complicated to figure out which is more common|pg||

nt|ahollan1: helpful hint for players [sounds like joke but serious]   when you have trouble counting length of long suit ... count the outside cards and subtract from 13|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C=drury,3+fit|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|JanM:  And DBL of 2@c is apparently just clubs - some play it as takeout of spades|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even by passed hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: DBL fra N is explained as "want a @c lead"|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Sabine having soft values invited|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|JanM:  I have no idea what 3@c was, but some sort of game try, probably not a sound one|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|jesperdall:  General game try, I guess|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|JanM:  since with a sound game try, she'd bid 4@s |pg||
nt|pelu:  more often - yes - but that do u need most - lead-directing og take-out D?|pg||
