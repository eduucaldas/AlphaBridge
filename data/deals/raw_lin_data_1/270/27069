mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|ritong: an other super chunky 2NT presumably|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Predictable in 3rd at favourable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but zia has not travelled to denmark to pass all hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 2@h = weak @h raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 2@d would have been a good 2@h raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|Henryb:  Fallenius grateful that North bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  but not for long|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not off the hook yet, Henry|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Otherwise he would have had to choose between 1@s and 2@c|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s most likely|pg||
nt|ritong: cheapest spot|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Now he has to choose between 2@S and 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  Now he has to choose one level higher|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, same applies|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  and now 3H|pg||
nt|nilsland:  torture|pg||
nt|ritong: he has an ace|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I think Fredin is overbidding|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult position|pg||
nt|JanM:  How good should Fredin be for this sequence? |pg||
nt|nilsland:  yes but he cant bid "an Ace"|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ritong: he does|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|nilsland:  2NT over 2S was an alternative |pg||
nt|JanM:  8 tricks, and some slight chance for a 9th if somehow he can set up diamonds before the opponents get 5 tricks, but that seems unlikely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Henryb:  but Fallenius would certainly raise to 3N over that|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the is not time to set up the diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||

nt|ritong: he knows zia joked, for starters|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|JanM:  If Zia had passed in 3rd seat at favorable, they'd probably be playing this from West, and maybe with a spade lead - then would depend whether N led the J or a low one, I think|pg||
nt|ritong: and also that boye has quacks for his weak raise|pg||
nt|nilsland:  A good point is that D followed by 2N could include 4S otherwise direct 2N instead of D|pg||

nt|ritong: perhaps for the same reason than boye, actually|pg||
nt|JanM:  This doesn't look bad to Zia, but the @s King is in the wrong hand for him. |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|JanM:  And it was 2-1 to be in one of the right hands, too :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  Fredin is one of the worlds greatest doublers, Nilsland said. He might have forgotten his double of 4@S against Germany in 1997 :)|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|Henryb:  A heavier 2N than most people play|pg||
nt|ritong: i suspect some miscount|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 2nt explained as 22-24|pg||
nt|ritong: or not  ok ok|pg||
nt|nilsland:  When Sweden won in Bonn 1997 we led the final against Denmark with 48-0 in halftime. First board in second half Fredin doubled 4C making 5 - we won by 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|JanM:  Zia & Boye playing attitude leads against NT - the lower the card led the more the leader likes the suit - Zia definitely likes his clubs|pg||
nt|kachchu: na.. but apnader khelar ki holo. 22-24 match.. kolkatay tourney ache,, khelben ki?|pg||
nt|JanM:  Or maybe  Zia is kidding, playing 4th best leads :),|pg||
nt|ritong: very possible|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Now if he could only get North in to return the suit before declarer has 9 tricks :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Fallenius likes his 9 tricks - if opps cant take 5 before he gets them|pg||
nt|ritong: not so dangerous, and can bring in surprising swings|pg||
nt|nilsland:  he may duck first trick to ensure that|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: "normally we play 4th best -- but you also know Zia" says Boye Brogeland when Bjorn Fallenius asked about leads|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Notice Bjorn's club spots: they can't|pg||
nt|JanM:  If clubs are really 4-4, it's safe to drive out the spades. |pg||
nt|vugraphzce: and then everyone looked at eachother and agreed -- Zia is "innovative" :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  not that he can be sure - anyway|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|Henryb:  I'm wrong|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|JanM:  If not, it might be right to try to take 9 tricks without losing the lead - 1 club, and 4 in each red suit. |pg||
nt|JanM:  Of course as the cards lie, everything works|pg||
nt|JanM:  For declarer that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: results after round 5 of 19: http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling4463.html|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|JanM:  Looks as if Fallenius is going to play to find out how the clubs lie before deciding how to play the hand|pg||
nt|JanM:  He can pitch spades from dummy as he ducks clubs and see what's happening|pg||
nt|ritong: also, if he starts @hs with the Q, he might get an honest count|pg||
nt|JanM:  Zia thinking about letting his partner hold this club, so he can find out what's happening |pg||
