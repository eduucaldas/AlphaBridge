nt|JanM:  Normal unlucky guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  Regarding feelings, I am sure South feels North should have felt differently :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  Operator, can you check how often south holds seven clubs in this tournament?|pg||
nt|JanM:  I'm sure South is sympathetic :) - South is one of the world's best partners and teammates|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: But I can tell you Jesper that Kamil didnt even comment after the board|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Of course not. Next board!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|JanM:  I remember when I hardly knew him and had had a disappointing afternoon session and happened to be at dinner with Michael Kamil and he managed to cheer me up somehow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|jesperdall:  Well, if south wins this a shifts to a club...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Then declarer ducks and plays king on second round...|pg||
nt|JanM:  Yes, on a club shift, declarer has to duck one round, but surely he's unlikely to do that|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  confident that south has seven clubs yet again :)|pg||
nt|JanM:  Sorry, I mean he's unlikely to cover the first club :)|pg||
nt|JanM:  9 of diamonds a thoughtful play by declarer, to encourage S to continue diamonds - after all, he doesn't know that clubs are 7-2.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't Kamil get sportsmanship award of some kind from ACBL?|pg||
nt|JanM:  East wishing he'd bid 4@h|pg||
nt|JanM:  Yes, Al, he did, and well-deserved|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Good to listen to all the nice comments about Kamil|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Michael Kamil told me before this round about the board in round 11 where Fallenius had the 7-card @c suit. At Kamil and Fleishers table S opened 4@cs - and they ended up in 4@ss. ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: At six other tables the slam was bid -- and that was after a 3@c opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he's also fun to do commentary with|pg||
nt|JanM:  http://www.acbl.org/news_archive.php?id=714 for the article about Kamil's sportsmanship award|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: earlier round today  Kamil called director on himself  after forgetting their agreement and ending up in UI situation|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  At the moment, south is wondering if declarer has Q109 of diamonds or Kx of clubs|pg||
nt|JanM:  Kamil does have a tough decision here, and he doesn't know that it doesn't matter. After all, if partner has Axx of clubs, it's right to shift to them, but if he has KJxxx of diamonds, it's right to lead another diamond|pg||

nt|JanM:  The other table on Vugraph did play in 4@h, much safer, and it gained them an IMP|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S 10-16|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  7-2-2-2 is not that interesting to fool around with, so pass is fine|pg||
nt|JanM:  Not clear whether or what Fleisher should bid here. Preempting both vul when the opponents have spades is very likely just to give away information when the opponents buy the hand|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|JanM:  2@c like unpassed hand Drury, Al?|pg||

nt|JanM:  But there, N had started with a DBL|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: how much do you adjust hand evaluation for 4-9s|pg||

mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|JanM:  Do you come in as South after 4@h PP - Oh, Fleisher solved that problem for his partner :)|pg||
nt|JanM:  Knowing that 1@d was unbalanced was helpful for North - he could judge to keep bidding over 4@h because he knew they had a real fit|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  North has the privilege of knowing that partner holds diamonds for real - so 5@d is fine|pg||
nt|JanM:  EW are pretty lucky here that 5@d goes down because the A of @ds is in the N hand|pg||

nt|pelu:  with no D for sure W would bid 5@h - now his partner tryed to help him|pg||

nt|JanM:  The other room had an interesting auction here to end in 2@cx by EW - opened 1@c with the S hand (probably clubs or balanced and treating this as balanced), 1@h overcall, 1@s which was a negative DBL sort of hand without 4 spades, 2@c DBL|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Which allows NS to find their heart fit - to their regret :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: right  Jonsson-Baldursson play Icelandic Precision  [aka Ice Relay]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|JanM:  This auction has pushed EW to 3@c, let's see if NS can DBL it|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  I am not familiar with the tactics after 2@c openings - should you bid a good five card major with a doubleton club?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after Kamil's DBL  Carroll expecting NS to have @S fit   so get in lead-director  or maybe partner has fit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|JanM:  Kamil probably thinking that West psyche the 2@h bid. Maybe Fleisher should have DBLd 3@c, since he had a better idea that 2@h was real and so they should be defending|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|JanM:  This is a good lead for declarer - can he now make 3NT?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  East should lead a low club on this auction|pg||
nt|JanM:  Cute spade position - he can play a spade to the 9 here, then drop the K under the A and finesse East out of the J|pg||
nt|ahollan1: an intrafinesse!!|pg||
nt|JanM:  And with diamonds coming in for 4 winners, that would be 9 (3 spades, a heart, 4 diamonds, a club)|pg||
nt|JanM:  Of course, it's more likely that the @s K is in East|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridgeace.com/lessons/BOLS/1974_Chagas_I_Love_Finesses.pdf|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Sure|pg||
pc|dT|nt|JanM:  Diamond now and he doesn't quite have enough entries, does he? But if Garvey covers the ten of diamonds ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and those more likely than specifically K8|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Would play King from KJ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: this could be "The deal of the day" if Fleisher wins this one|pg||
nt|JanM:  I don't think he would play K from KJ or even KT. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: well there is that|pg||
nt|JanM:  This is cute now - he can run the diamonds and then play a low spade off the dummy, end-playing East to give him the 9th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Fleisher lays down his cards|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  He has 2+1+4+1 now|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|JanM:  EW are likely to get to 4@s here, and look to have 10 tricks as long as they don't lose 2 spades and 2 diamonds, which would be pretty unlucky|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  I like that EW haven't told much - but I think East should probe for other games than in spades|pg||
nt|JanM:  We're seeing more and more transfers in all sorts of situations - transfer responses are pretty common after interference over 1M and this pair (and others) extend to transfers in response to 1M|pg||
nt|JanM:  Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 2nt was just any 14+ hand|pg||

nt|JanM:  Fleisher looking to get a diamond ruff to beat the hand - a reasonable attempt (would have worked if Kamil had the @c A instead of K), but won't here|pg||

mb|p|nt|JanM:  A club lead would have made it more difficult, with defense threatening to tap declarer out, but I don't think it would beat it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and balanced can be 3352|pg||
pc|s7|nt|JanM:  Difficult to get the clubs right here - it's sort of more natural to play for the Q in West, but East did bid ...|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Lengthwise, west is favourite being short in spades|pg||
nt|JanM:  I'll predict he gets it wrong - that way at least he has a chance (given my track record on predictions)|pg||

nt|vugraphzce: and here you might find some of the convention cards for some of the pairs: http://www2.bridge.dk/Participants.aspx?ID=6885|pg||
nt|JanM:  Should the @c 9 push him to get it right? He can't pick up Q8xx in West, so the fact that with stiff 9, East would always play it is irrelevant, but he might also play 9 from 9x|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  However, table presence may play a role too, here - is Fleisher a "feel player"?|pg||
