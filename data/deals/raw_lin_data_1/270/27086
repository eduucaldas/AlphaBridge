nt|sommer: difficult slam...could be problems|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|bilde:  2 spades pass or correct?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcf: I geuss so. No one has asked yet. But Barel is thinking right now..|pg||
mb|2N!|an|maximum with hearts|mb|p|nt|sommer: was that an obvious pass from Blakset?|pg||
nt|bilde:  he may not want to double 2 spades as clubs are also on the run|pg||
nt|sommer: he might have bid 3@C..|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sommer: would give him more space to show a good hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzcf: 2nt was maximum with hearts|pg||
nt|sommer: ..unless, he had this in mind all the time;-)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bilde:  I am not actually sure that the slam will actually win because of the holdings in both black suits.. they will plays hearts will will shorten you in trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bilde:  which will|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sommer: it won't|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bilde:  Ok but perhaps 4spades will win:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but this will!|pg||

nt|bilde:  what if west ruffs and returns a spade? - |pg||
nt|sommer: the ruff should have come 1st time!|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|bilde:  if he returns a spade south will take it with the Qs and ruff a club, and ruff a heart back to the hand|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|sommer: 10 tricks with help of the @C's|pg||
nt|bilde:  yes|pg||
nt|sommer: strange, maybe, but a 1st time ruff and @HJ would have done a big difference|pg||
nt|sommer: ..then S would be "shorter" first|pg||
nt|bilde:  a lucky board for North /South as it is a good slam to bid - requires a 3-2 break in spades or a 3-1 break in clubs |pg||
