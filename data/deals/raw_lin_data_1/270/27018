mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Paulhac: 2@H is a slight underbid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  really? isn't that an offer to play?|pg||
nt|Dagold: it was heart lead and spade switch so declarer hoped for @d 3-2 and to pitch the other heart. Seems percentage unless you think opps are very clever|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Dagold: ah|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Dagold: double or 1@s?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Paulhac: Nowadays most players bid 1@S on the South hand|pg||
nt|Dagold: I would|pg||
nt|Henryb:  now at the other table N-S never bid! South passed after 1@d - P - 1@h. Which seems like a very un-junior-like action|pg||
nt|Dagold: more chance to compete in spades and I am on lead to hearts|pg||
nt|Dagold: 4@s only on a hook! and 4@h could be cold either way|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Well, a hook and spades not 4-0|pg||
