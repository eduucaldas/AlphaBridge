mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: EW plays a 1@d opening as an ubalanced hand with 4+@d  (normally at least 5@ds)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jesperdall:  3NT will go down, while 4@h and 5@c make|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: but here Kamil choose to open 1@d with a balanced hand -- and E explains that the 1nt rebid should show a 2@c rebid -- but W says to NS that he "forgot"|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jesperdall:  But...NS must lead spades AND grab their ace(s) early to win the race|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  The aces are positioned so it is hard to mess the defense up|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: the danish pair at the other table bid and made  3nt|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  ...but if declarer leads a low heart from dummy at trick 2...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|jesperdall:  South: "might this be a singleton 10?"|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  If not, he can count 8 tricks fro EW outside clubs|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  so partner needs the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: I am not sure about the meaning of the @h5 from North|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  and no chance of messing up the spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: not sure about the NS agreements here --- Smiths Echo or Reversed or something else|pg||

nt|OleBerg:  Even if the defence starts with three rounds of clubs, wouldn't declarer have som communication problems?|pg||
