nt|kiwibridge: specifically @C or either minor?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|uni_dennis:  specifically @c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks CRO Michaels then|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  so E can bid @s fit without worrying about a possible @d fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good system|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  we learn those things from our world champions, like Brink-Drijver|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: Last set Israel picked up some 30 imps to take the lead by 7. They also have 0.33 IMP carry-over from the round robin, so effectively that means they'll win in the event of a tie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: they are a great pair, roll on Lille, France in a few days :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  2@d and 1@h to lose|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: Israel started the final with a carr-over of 0.33 imps|pg||

nt|ritong: leading strict count in "bid" suits could help|pg||
nt|ritong: here, doubling 2@d can be considered as bidding the suit|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if W switches @c|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if decl doesn't go up with the K, then E can play @d again|pg||
pc|c4|nt|uni_dennis: decl only has 8 tricks by going up with the K|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: even with 4@h tricks|pg||

mb|3D|nt|kemperg: no tie poss. Israel has a .33 carryover|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|kemperg: this is the last set of the tournament|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: might need to find @CQ to make this|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kemperg: right Bill|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: the distributional odds favour playing West for @CQ, since diamonds are probably 6-3|pg||
nt|kemperg: Duth were a bit shy in CR, not bidding 3@D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: so there are more spaces in the West hand, spaces that might include @CQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|poohbear: you also find out East has 3 trumps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|poohbear: and 2@s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, good point|pg||
nt|poohbear: you need to take first round hook as well|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so running @CJ or @C9 here is a 2-1 favourite|pg||
nt|bjacobs: if diamonds are 6-3, as is likely.  if they are 5-4, then it's a 1-1 shot|pg||
nt|poohbear: No way they are 5-4 . More likely 7-2 despite West's raise :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: to see the bidding in CR hoover  over the contract|pg||
nt|poohbear: Padon wouldnt bid with Kx xxx AK10xx Qxx|pg||
nt|poohbear: not a shot|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think declarer is resigned to play @ds to be 6-3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: Henri @H|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  in discussions among dutch juniors i believe they play DBL on 4@s as take-out|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  opener should normally bid, unless he has a very flat hand or good @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: most likely, yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems a bit high for me|pg||
nt|ritong: double means " i want to stay in but i have no clear direction to go"|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  but pass is right on this lay-out|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  dutch coach says they do not have rubbish if they overcall 4@s|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  so you should dbl to play a contract yourself and accept that they get away with -100 instead of -300 once and a while|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: fisher doesn't open his 11, gerstner does in 3rd hand|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis:  but wackwitz not fond of bidding on this minimum|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|uni_dennis:  think he still loses 1@D 1@S and 2@c now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|uni_dennis:  and even 4@h is in trouble losing 1 trick in each suit most likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis:  maybe no @h loser|pg||
nt|ritong: surprising not to compete with east hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: EW can make 3@d, NS will make a @h partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis:  @c5 switch 3rd 5th with some attitude|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  with 8752 would lead high|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he thinks they are in trouble, also 6322 is not top|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|uni_dennis:  @d back now|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  if decl then finesses in @s will go -2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|uni_dennis: maybe E thinks they play a 4-3 fit|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: many "don t sell your hand twice" in private   the sixth @d has not been sold yet, imo|pg||

nt|kemperg: Oh no more|pg||

nt|rensph: Repeated trump leads by EW will make life difficult for declarer here|pg||
nt|rensph: With diamonds not splitting, @CA and another will see declarer go off in this contract as he'll be short some tricks|pg||
nt|rensph: While Wackwitz is thinking about best line of defense here, a peek at the other table where they have copied the contract on Bd 2, 2@SX there as well, will be 800 or 1100|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: the grand was missed it gets even tougher for Israel|pg||
pc|hK|nt|uni_dennis:  israel in 4@h on bd 3|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: Helmich worried that W would have a bad hand with some @s length, like 5332|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ritong: that is what he will have most of the time, admittedly|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: W can compete with say 4432 and some 6+hcp |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: E hand looks nice for a raptor 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but if S then bids 2@d, you end up with the same problem|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: W thinking E will have 4@s, so no reason to bid and E then no more bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rensph: Looks like declarer will make his two top spades and two trumps here for -2, no more.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rensph: he can set up his diamond but E will hold the 13th trump to ruff immediately and cash hearts. Potentially a swing to the Netherlands.|pg||
nt|rensph: Bd2 -1100 copied at the other table|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|uni_dennis:  low @s now and see that N started with 4-4 Ms|pg||
nt|ritong: now he makes|pg||

nt|bjacobs: indeed you do, but there is no reason that I can see to depart from the normal play, which is to bang them out from the top|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: so this will be a flat board, whether in 5@C or 3NT ireckon|pg||
nt|kemperg: W not sure with only 1 @H stop|pg||
nt|poohbear: pretty close either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: or 4@s?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: not a good idea|pg||
nt|ritong: although logical|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hatol:  its better to play than you dont know the results|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: It's been a great tournament, the future of bridge is assured with these great young players, it's been a priviledge to watch them, thanks to BBO|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hatol:  if he would play 2 rounds of hearts will see the K + QJ D so its likely that W holds the ace of club|pg||
nt|poohbear: As we say in Hebrew . Kol Hakavod  to both teams for a very well played match  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: is there a restricted choice argument here? low club to 10 and queen, then when a second is played, you are comparing AQ/AJ doubleton versus QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|poohbear: Kol hakavod means We are very proud of both teams|pg||
nt|kit: Natural play looks to be to pitch a club on the ace of diamonds, draw trumps and play ace and a heart.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: yes, some of the israeli players already futuring in the international top bridge, these dutch juniors will follow|pg||
nt|ritong: as usual, there is something stronger than "restricted choice", bill|pg||
nt|poohbear: these are the last 2 boards of the tournament|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what might that be Henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: @h discovery, for instance|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks also to all the great comments from those watching, and those commentating, the operators who have battled the elements, and everyone who has contributed|pg||
nt|ritong: question is: can he time this in order to know early enough about @hs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we look forward to the excitement from Lille, France in a few days|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what has hearts got to do with anything?  setting up @HJ doesn't help, and you can't take too much from the bidding|pg||
nt|kit: he can afford to play ace and a heart before touching clubs I believe.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'd just play the percentages in clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: the 3@d opening|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: true, but then there is and end-play|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: do you often open a preempt with outside A and K?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: It looks like declarer is adopting my approach.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: he has to draw trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: otherwise you go down when it was makeable because the defence get a club ruff|pg||
nt|hatol:  he will make it now|pg||
nt|kit: East unblocked the king of hearts in an attempt to avoid an end-play, but that may just make life easier for declarer.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Certainly locating the @HK makes it easier to get the play right in clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: fine:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: just icing on the restricted choice cake Henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: no problemo|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: also played @dQ in first trick|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think he even has a guess.  West will be marked with a doubleton club, so after the hand is stripped all he has to do is duck a club.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so @dQJ + @hK and an ace?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, @DQJ, @HK, unlikely to include @CA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The doubleton club is needed with West whatever, I think|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: In the meantime the other two finals finished. Many congratulations to Poland on winning the Youngsters as well as the Girls, against USA1 and the Netherlands respectively|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: Good play by West, but it won't help him.|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe it will -- now if he leads a diamond the ruff and discard doesn't help declarer, so he will have to go right in clubs.|pg||
nt|kit: But I still don't see any variation where declarer can realistically go wrong.|pg||
nt|hatol:  also W bid 4d |pg||
nt|hatol:  would he with QJ in club i dont think so|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so we're up to at least 3 reasons to get this right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Lankveld better make this!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless you are an Israel supporter :)|pg||

nt|uni_dennis:  5@D will make for NS|pg||
nt|poohbear: Meyuchas pass of 2@s bizarre|pg||
nt|poohbear: good suit ace on the side is enough to overcall. Besides his obligation with short @s|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  might be defending 2@s with 3NT cold|pg||

nt|uni_dennis:  4@s - 4N // 5@d ?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@s for NS|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: EW might hide the @d position, so S can play for E to hold @cA|pg||
nt|ritong: he mmight go for @hs first and get info  unsure he has time for that, though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though if S finds out about @hK in E, more likely that W has the @cA|pg||
nt|ritong: way more|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: opening 3@d with a King and an Ace in side suits less likely|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: new leader again|pg||

nt|kareno: On the comparison I usually say, 'we didn't play that board.'|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Two boards to go, Israel need 3 IMPs to overtake NL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes don't forget the fractions|pg||
nt|kit: Another potentially exciting hand here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@h very interesting in NS|pg||
mb|1D|mb|3C|nt|uni_dennis: S passed in CR|pg||
nt|bjacobs: the opening gets them to 4@H|pg||
nt|kit: it looks like there might be an end-play in 4@H with the spades blocked, but I don't think N-S have enough trumps to make it pay off.|pg||
nt|hatol:  5cl |pg||
nt|bjacobs: and it's hard for East to stay of the @SA lead|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: even if EW don't crash their @S endplay against W?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so|pg||
nt|bjacobs: how can East stay away from the disaster lead?  (I am assuming 3@H from North here)|pg||
nt|ritong: first we have to know who declares|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|kit: 3 rounds of trumps gone, one needed to ruff losing diamond, so no trumps left to ruff spade after ruff and discard.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NS play Switch|pg||
mb|4S|nt|uni_dennis: so 3@s shows @hs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: after today, they will Switch Back|pg||
nt|hatol:  what a bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: maybe not ... East has found an imaginative bid for the lead|pg||
nt|ritong: inter alia|pg||
nt|kit: Well, we won't get to see 4@H now.|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: could we see 5@H?  or 5@C doubled?|pg||
nt|ritong: you rite, yogi|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or even 4@S?|pg||
nt|poohbear: not 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they'll accept the insufficient bid of 4@H by South now, but our software won't|pg||
nt|kit: Now pressure on South.  Great heart support, but hand is all defense otherwise.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and very minimum|pg||
nt|hatol:  pass F |pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: after 4@s those small @ss don't look nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Seems to me he should take his plus score vs. 5@C doubled.|pg||
nt|hatol:  i dont see any other bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: a lot of pressure on North here ... a 5@D bid is possible|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: Yes.  I think South should have doubled 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|poohbear: this is one sick way to finish :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hatol:  what a winning 4sp|pg||
nt|ritong: you know what yogi said|pg||
nt|kit: So if 5@H is down 2, that's 6 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|ritong: it s not over til it s over|pg||
nt|poohbear: Padon can only be thinking of dbling|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: really 4@S was a very good bid, and very reasonable: you have a saving hand at favourable, so why not point the lead on the way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brilliant 4@S. Hard to find even with all cards in view|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: defense needs to be careful against a 4@h in NS|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but EW shutting NS up here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: bd 12 EW in 4@h even for israel|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: especially 4@h played by N, probably gets @sA lead|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: then just lose 2@s and a @h|pg||
nt|kareno: Very risky for north to pass 4@c|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but S being a passed hand, so chances of game are slim|pg||
nt|kit: If North wanted to act, he should have done so over 3@C|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: I agre|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: *agree|pg||
nt|kareno: Absolutely, Kit, when it was safest.  The hand with the distribution must take the pressure.|pg||
nt|ritong: well he has a supplementary information now|pg||
nt|ritong: east raised|pg||
nt|kit: does he?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: all that means is that partner doesn't have too many clubs, but is that good or bad?|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  4@s not entirely chanceless as well|pg||
nt|ritong: also means that east has zero hope for 3NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|uni_dennis:  2@C followed by 2@s showing 5@s and invitational hand|pg||
nt|rensph: In 2@S here, if defense is not careful one of them will be thrown in to give up the hearts at some point, must not allow declarer to ruff his club first|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|uni_dennis: if he wanted to bid forcing, could bid 2@h i suppose|pg||
pc|c4|nt|poohbear: 2C shows a limit raise . so 3@c forcing I think|pg||
nt|kit: seems to me that if the redouble shows invite strength, then any jump should then be forcing.|pg||

nt|hatol:  he can bid 2h for F 3cl is a very storng inv|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh sorry, kit quite so ... it was a jump.  you are quite right|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: then 2@h can be short|pg||
nt|poohbear: Not clear whether Padon meant it as forcing!|pg||

nt|hatol:  looks like 150 as the cards were played|pg||
nt|rensph: 180 is published as the result on the WBF site as well|pg||

nt|uni_dennis:  good result for israel|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like North should have had the info as to who had the missing diamond. |pg||
mb|1C|nt|kiwibridge: Thanks everybody, join us again tomorrow for the last two sets|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  tomorrow we start at 10:30 again|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: bd 13 and 14 look well for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: bd 15 can be the decider|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|uni_dennis: 2@c 10+ with @cs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: advantage of 2@c instead of 1@D is that S has to bid at 2-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis:  4@h here for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: was it really down 1? |pg||
mb|2N|nt|uni_dennis:  4:30 for the european viewers that is|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT by West will be difficult to defeat|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis:  but will not bid it|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  strange that Wackwitz doesn't accept wiht 2N|pg||
nt|rensph: Helmich inserted @C8 in trick 1..... losing to the 9, then the endplay came. @C8 seems like a strange card. Israel extending their lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: N surely won't lead @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: raising 3@h is not excluded|pg||
nt|poohbear: Last hand. Back with the last set today in a little less than 1 hour  X:50|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  this time|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 more sets tomorrow |pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  3@h not inviting game|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2NT min balanced|pg||
pc|sA|nt|uni_dennis:  just a competitive bid showing 6@h|pg||
nt|kit: It just doesn't pay to stop on a dime with a hand such as this.|pg||
nt|ritong: helmich resisted the " oh well 3NT" temptation  gutsy guy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rensph: Same contract other room.... but doubled.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rensph: N could see bad breaks and opps having shown minimal values|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  but now Wackwitz likes his hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|uni_dennis:  5:30 for israel|pg||
pc|s4|nt|uni_dennis:  4@d and 6@h tricks nothing NS can do|pg||
nt|ritong: padon should decide right here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  and maybe overtrick now|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  big last board this|pg||
nt|ritong: well he goes for the throat|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: 230 here|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but it will cost him 10 IMPs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: hard to describe how hideous that double is|pg||
nt|ritong: gutsy|pg||
nt|ritong: hideous?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  helpful lead|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  can discard a @s on the @cs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  so i guess he will make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: maybe|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: anyones to win tomorrow, should be exciting|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  3 rounds of @c and @sA and @s will give N an overruff, then @d back and needs to play the right one|pg||
nt|rensph: assuming both declarers take 7 tricks here, it looks like we'll go into the last set with an exact tie at 140 each, |pg||
nt|rensph: Next set starts in 1 hour and 30 minutes, 16 more boards|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: it does not mean " i ve got @h AKQ", i don t think, gary|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|ritong: it rather means " hey buddy , do something right once in your life"|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  N did not overcall immediately so can't expect defense from him|pg||
nt|ritong: and dror did not, much to my surprise i d say|pg||
nt|rensph: Other room has allowed declarer to escape for down one...|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: this is clearly not a pass and pulol position|pg||
nt|kareno: But oh, well, 3nt fetches|pg||
nt|ritong: i salute his bravery anyway|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|nt|ritong: pull*|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so the final board the decider then?|pg||
nt|kit: Do you really think they would find the defense to defeat 3NT?  If there is one.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h8|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|uni_dennis:  no overtrick, should he have played a low @d to the 1st trick?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this is the last session|pg||
nt|ritong: well, i do not know:)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|nt|kareno: 12 opposite 12|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: go Kiwi the gold medal is yours|pg||
pc|d9|nt|uni_dennis:  S needs to play another @s now|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  for N to ruff and @d back|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: for all he knows, both contracts can easily make, so he must bid 4@s imho|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|ritong: see you in 50 minutes or so|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  i a way EW were lucky to find a good fit in the minors|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  if E held @dx and @c xxx would have been expensive|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  yes, in 50 minutes the 3rd session|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  NS in 3NT on 15, needs to get @s right|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h3|pc|dA|nt|uni_dennis:  decision time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: GOLD for New Zealand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they won with great finesse|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  hooray for New Zealand :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mens double sculls|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  13 imps at stake here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks everyone you've been great company|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  S did not lead @d|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  might lead it with Qxxx|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  not Axxx|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Dennis you've said more on your one hand than I did in the previous 15 :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|uni_dennis:  i talked him in playing the wrong card :(|pg||
