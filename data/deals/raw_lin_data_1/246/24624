nt|bjacobs: sure, but there is a downside in bidding|pg||
nt|poohbear: South knows that North has real @cs when he bids 1@h. THerefore the free preference|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: of course there is . But the vul is right |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|poohbear: notice Padon doesnt even dbl|pg||
nt|poohbear: he might have if the opps were vul. Very little upside nv unless you think you can beat them 3|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||

nt|uni_dennis:  in discussions among dutch juniors i believe they play DBL on 4@s as take-out|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  opener should normally bid, unless he has a very flat hand or good @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: most likely, yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems a bit high for me|pg||
nt|ritong: double means " i want to stay in but i have no clear direction to go"|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  but pass is right on this lay-out|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  dutch coach says they do not have rubbish if they overcall 4@s|pg||
nt|uni_dennis:  so you should dbl to play a contract yourself and accept that they get away with -100 instead of -300 once and a while|pg||

nt|ritong: although logical|pg||
