mb|4H|nt|vugraphzcv: slamtime.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|w i t h:  this one is!|pg||
nt|w i t h:  but hard than the last board, lol|pg||

nt|vugraphzcv: throw a sp on cl....|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: other table 7 h minus 1 i hear....|pg||
nt|w i t h:  good news to EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: so can be a big bard for Hauge....|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: And i think they need it....|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: board|pg||
nt|w i t h:  unfortunately just non-vul|pg||
nt|w i t h:  this board he only requires K@S A@H, Q@C and K@D to make a grand slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcv: they will be happy when they win this board....|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|w i t h:  and minus any points like the A@H, he only needs 8 points|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|mc|12|nt|w i t h:  so reasonable to try for slam since p may have some extreme shapes from his bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: still 10 imps....|pg||
nt|w i t h:  they will not be happy for the moment|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4@h is a weak bid as they use 2NT as GF and 3@h as invitational. He has the wital Q@c.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: they are not...|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|w i t h:  @H lead is a typical one against such bidding|pg||
nt|w i t h:  since the declarer does not show any 8 card suit|pg||
nt|stoffers: Good lead, and guess continuation, but Furunes has way too much goods for this to fail. Around 140 i guess|pg||

nt|w i t h:  but it is useless here, the declarer does not need cross ruff|pg||

mb|3S|nt|vugraphzcv: yet:)|pg||
nt|w i t h:  but here they compete with 1@S|pg||
nt|w i t h:  which may lead to the fatal @S lead|pg||
nt|stoffers: only 13hcp, but really standard 3@h bid from Furunes|pg||
nt|stoffers: There is no fatal lead..|pg||
nt|w i t h:  but if they play 6H it is safty|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|stoffers: Its cold, 13 if they dont cash|pg||
