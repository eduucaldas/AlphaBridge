If battaggia didn't want to take the risk of playing three rounds of spades, he had better take in dummy and lead trumps to his hand, which makes a huge difference if north holds the singleton ace|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|uni_dennis: W showed a @h-splinter after he heard @s-fit and E bid the slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: Chance for a french pickup out of the gate. slam time in hcp, missing cashing AK :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@h a weak-2, but dutch juniors only require a 5card to do that in 1st hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2@s N-S but that's not an easy contract as North is short of entries.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: they like to put the pressure on quickly|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The slam is off, but this might be cozy 4@h.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6@d N-S played by North if I may. :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|uni_dennis: exciting deal, but no one can really make anything, 3@s and 4@c the max.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We are watching Juniors, round 6, according to this plan:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/TaicangScheduleOfPlay.pdf|pg||

nt|malipivo:  3!n N-S contract shall go down if they get there.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|malipivo:  The entry provides a club ruff.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is also a 7@s slam, but declarer would need to play @sJ.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Open Room is playing 4@cN. There was no desire to try 3!n.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's see if they bid 4@s, it has its chances.|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  My apologies audience. I will be straightened out by board 6 :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I am surprised E does not make a negative double at this vulnerability, but his partner could be light in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason is that after a spade lead there is @hK as an entry.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, the contract is 1!n here, 2@dE in the other room.|pg||
nt|minimeck: My spies also tell me there is a chinese bridge site with certain rights of broadcast, so there is one match on there|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A diamond slam is easier as we may ruff one spade trick.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n N-S is our next hand.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|minimeck: Well done to any pair here who can put on the brakes, suspect alot of -10's across the field|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wejcie w obronê w 1 jest delikatnie mówi¹c fransuskim podarkiem w polskim wykonaniu|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I'm guessing E/W are playing Precision also|pg||
nt|minimeck: 4@h here is not the worst game ever bid, has some chances depending on the defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Hi everyone!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the preempt did his work here|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: po klikniêciu z lewej stronyt na numer stolu, mozna obejrzec wyniki posczegolnych meczow|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is easy for us to spot a heart lead, and it is there.|pg||
nt|minimeck: NS tend to open "almost" all 11 counts, this one did not fit that criteria :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h contract has its chances but the texture is weak.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If you ask why by North, the reason is the club attack itself.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|malipivo:  OR, 3!nW.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  1@D shows 11-15 with at least 1 or 2 Diamonds, depending on partnership agreement|pg||
nt|galallie:  good pass by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: -50's|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well, he knows that even though his partner is at the max, they don't have the points for game, and he can smell a bad @S break with the double|pg||
nt|minimeck: slam is purely 50%, although better with the opening bid|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well, they were playing a contract with a bad break either way, so it may not be terrible|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6!n by N is also in consideration, in theory.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lukasz1982: Je³i rzeczywiscie pad³o 2@s, to powinno odrobinê wyjaniæ sk³ady|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: declarer needs to get @hs right to make 4@s, but after the 2@h opener he won't go wrong |pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  5@d from defenders?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, not today.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3NT mesns 16 19 6+S|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  looks very unlikely that declarer will get 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n looks makeable as diamonds are friendly distributed 5-3.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But also needs good guessing in spades.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Grossack with a bold choice here|pg||
nt|minimeck: and a winner it is|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Dutch ladies know they are 32 imps behind, they might bid it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Roger might try 3H instead of the more obvious 3NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In this deal hearts are sitting nicely.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West found the best lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2@d was a weak two in one of the majors, N-S were considering a heart contract, so it must be spades.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  North may switch to hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Personal messages and co-commentators are most welcome, I am just helping out here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer may get 4 heart tricks now, finessing @hQ on her way back.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  This won't challenge W at all.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hackenbush: actually declarer can't easily make use of this extra diamond trick|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: open room also in 4@s, but played by south after a gadget in the bidding: pas - 1@d - pas - 3@c as 6+@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @c lead there, so declarer needs to get @hs right|pg||
nt|poohbear: No guess. Cant let South in|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h would go down one.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  welcome!|pg||
nt|asya13: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  E-W must find out that East is having @sA, not @hA.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: Ticha should have bid 3@D (forcing) to be followed by 5@H (exclusion)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|johnjones:  He'll play HA, and a H|pg||
nt|hackenbush: then another diamond will put him to a decision|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Lee takes his time. In the last World University Bridge Championship, he took 10 minutes for a play decision in a slam|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Then he will go for several hands and play at the speed of light.  But when he thinks, it will be for a while.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is buying 5@dX.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  now there's a chance|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|coolbeans:  This is going down a few|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Girls are swimming in dangerous waters now.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A club lead will defeat 6.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have 4 clubs, 1 diamond, 3 hearts, at least one round of spades is expected for the 9th trick.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  And E/W had nothing their way, so this will be a good pickup for them|pg||
nt|asya13: Not a good bid by south vul|pg||
nt|asya13: might have not noticed he is red|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Has some help though with the non-Club lead|pg||
nt|asya13: Club ruff isnt going anywhere luckily|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I count 9 tricks on crossruffing, which would be a 7 IMP pickup for the US|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The crossruffing is fortunate with 4-4 breaks in both suits|pg||
nt|minimeck: Can set up hearts for 0 losers, defense now only 3 @s and a of clubs available|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It was a great lead limiting declarer to 8 tricks so far.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|coolbeans:  For running scores, check here throughout the night: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qtournid=922&qphase=QF|pg||
nt|minimeck: if they take them now of course :) otherwise 10 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is still bidding 5@d+...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is having its chance to make this contract.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|uni_dennis: other room 4@sX|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Well done by Magdalena Ticha.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: @cJ switch here normal, they switch 2nd/4th towards dummy|pg||
nt|malipivo:  First imps flow to Chinese Taipei.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: Juniors indeed bid 3@D, followed by 5@H, reaching 7@D this way.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|malipivo:  Some people might be scared leading from AQ into a 2NT opener.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: revoke always difficult to handle as operator|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: because you cannot enter it (safety against misclicks)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with the revoke this will be 1 off, as director will give a trick to the defense|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|malipivo:  and it continues there, 5@h-6@c-X|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6@d|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I believe that they are using curtain at a bridge table, otherwise: one smiley is a spade ace, two are the heart ace. :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer misguessed position of @cA-@cQ, it is going down.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hackenbush: a sensible choice, enjoying the hearts without needing to commit to a club guess. Now @cK exit after cashing hearts will see him home|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie chcia³a wzi¹æ 12?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Well bid by east here, a deserved 6 imps|pg||
nt|minimeck: But not home yet i suppose, might try to drop the king of hearts, although i doubt it|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d9|nt|z_lasu: w sumie wrocilo do normy|pg||

pc|cT|nt|johnjones:  We may be here a while.  I had Roger take 25 minutes to play a hand against me in a home team game.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  North is very tied up though.  I'm betting on Roger.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is playing 4@hS.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: it was much easier for E in the open room|pg||
pc|h9|nt|malipivo:  4@h would be easier for declarer, but it is easy for us to see|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|minimeck: An interesting hand here, votes for 2@h vs pass (or multi if that is the option)|pg||

nt|malipivo:  4@s N-S is a risky contract, but @hQ doubleton helps significantly.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  4@s is going down: @sAKQ, @cA.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 3@d a Bergen Raise, but CC doesn't say how strong, 10-11 presumably|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@s would be down one, but that's difficult contract.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, a slamland on this deal.|pg||
nt|galallie:  yes. he cant x with his hand, also an x may be responsive|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@dX would be two down and it is called phantom sacrifice.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  yes, @sK is sitting nicely|pg||
nt|malipivo:  What a slam, I hope they will bid it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer on a non spade lead can strip the hand and knowing that North has at most 2@ss from the bidding can play ace and a @s to the Q and claim no  matter who has the king|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  NS missed game for +170 only, so this will be the first real blood of the match!!!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is real bridge, so a peaceful contract and fight for overtricks.|pg||

nt|poohbear: If North wins the king dbltn he has to give a ruff sluff|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Not sure about the alerts|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even if defense wouldn't take @cA, neither hearts nor diamonds provide enough winners to discard all those clubs.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|malipivo:  defence was considering sacrificing, but not today|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Juniors, round 8, according to this plan:|pg||

nt|lukasz1982: dzien dobry:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: 9 tricks now, 4@d 4@s + whichever one the defense chooses to give you|pg||
nt|malipivo:  North must be careful to duck first trump trick.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is also in 4@s.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|johnjones:  A typical pushy vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  a trump will be the best lead for the defense|pg||
nt|hackenbush: to be fair, game was far from laydown|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/TaicangScheduleOfPlay.pdf|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results and running scores for all three series here:|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|johnjones:  True, but the layout looks friendly enough for both 4H and 3NT to work.  |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hop avoided the @c lead, so will go 1 off|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h is a fine contract for the other side, diamonds providing winners fro a club discard|pg||
nt|minimeck: North very well might take the plunge here, not the best shape however|pg||
pc|sK|nt|malipivo:  Three suits double stopped.|pg||

nt|minimeck: :)|pg||

pc|s4|nt|malipivo:  All three series are playing the same boards, we may compare their results afterwards easily.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: 1@d = pewnie @h, a kontra fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West should bid the slam. singleton @c and an important @s card|pg||
nt|poohbear: and sure enuff|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It was a nice bid.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He will have a right to play it, but bidding is not over.|pg||
nt|poohbear: save is reasonable|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@d went down a lot in the other room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot two diamonds ruffs in a club contract.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|johnjones:  with the CA wrong, down 1 looks likely|pg||
nt|keylime:  I'd expect a game too many versus a game too few from the juniors.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: lub cos:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: will normally make this, but he can go wrong|pg||
nt|poohbear: more likely 2 ruffs in a @d contract|pg||
nt|asya13: puppet|pg||
nt|minimeck: Take em or leave em South :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Against that, Lee will to well to go down 2|pg||

pc|s6|nt|malipivo:  Declarer lead trumps too early forgetting his only chance: clubs.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Personally, I dont particularly like the odds of 4@s, his 3@s bid allready showed his hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: winning 3 imps versus losing a bunch if 4@h was not making, need to be pretty sure :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The risk is that 500/800 points are there for sure, 4@h might still have a chance to get beaten.|pg||
nt|galallie:  this should be down two|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yep|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I thought it was Puppet, but then 3@D isn't right|pg||
pc|s3|nt|uni_dennis: 4@sX -1 on bd 2, so 7 imps back to Netherlands|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, 4@sN, @hK lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If North would have three diamonds and two clubs, there is one possible ruff.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|poohbear: So lets see if Nabil can play it as well as he bid it|pg||
nt|poohbear: I say yes|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: E apparently opened to let NS find a makable contract|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: if he decides to take a @h finesse for example|pg||
nt|frankaus: prob duck @c in presumed safe (w) hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: IF he had not do that,the contract was "make"|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: playing on @c will get him home indeed with 2@s, 3@h, 1@d, 3@c |pg||
nt|malipivo:  A low spade now would be nice.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lukasz1982: AJx kier jest przed kierami, wiec w zasadzie nic sie wielkiego nie dzieje|pg||
nt|galallie:  returning the 10 of diamonds wouldve made it easier for the defense|pg||

pc|s5|nt|uni_dennis: now no @c9 so duck to W|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defense is accurate.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|johnjones:  Anything but a C now and declarer is sunk|pg||

nt|malipivo:  he is working on it|pg||
nt|poohbear: I played with him in Australia a couple of years ago and he is a very good card player|pg||
pc|h2|nt|malipivo:  West must be careful do discard hearts as least as possible.|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lukasz1982: i teraz juz 11 :)|pg||

nt|malipivo:  A push board, interesting was to consider 3!n as defence cannot attack two suits at once.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze, ¿e vugraf nie mo¿e lew w drug¹ stronê puszczaæ - dopiero mielibymy kino|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the aftermatch analysis, this was right contract.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  5@h had no chance as @dK was offside.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I'd love to say that there is a slam, but there isn't.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer in the other room is facing same problem and this shall be our first flat board.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  20-20 hcps hand|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but spade lead would be fatal|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  very nice play, west did make a mistake but it's hard to play for a singleton diamond in declarers 2nt opener|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ryskiel_: jasne - nasze dziewczyny siê nie szczypi¹ tylko otwieraj¹ z rêki|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Risky slam would go down after a diamond attack.|pg||
nt|galallie:  since NS can make 4clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A question from spec: but what if W had not cashed @H K? Let it be my homework, the play is so fast.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And first major swing to Poland.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  We are watching Argentina vs. France.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@c a transfer to @d|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would like to be in 4@s.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Nice bid by gandoglia|pg||
nt|minimeck: Might be very tough to avoid doubling this|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n is the contract N-S is looking for.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n is makeable E-W, but only we see that.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@c would be one down: there are 2 spades and @dA losers.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Any voters for 4@h?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Slame time for north south, available on guessing the jack of @d|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In spades, the critical card is @sT.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If we play @sT we may get 4 tricks in spades.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec (board 3): E should have played a 3d H|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  1NT was 14 - 16|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Juniors. Argentina currently standing 9th, France currently sharing 5th.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may expect 5@c.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec and agreed as ruffing in club becomes impossible: indeed :) would have made endplay impossible|pg||
mb|3H|nt|malipivo:  Running scores for our match:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results/BoardDetails.asp?qmatchid=1051|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: operatorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: gives E room to show his 6card @h|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have got a new leader.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If declarer preserves @hA and @dA as entries, she will have enough time to develop clubs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may also spot that developing in spades might be in consideration, but only we see that spades break nicely 3-3.|pg||
nt|minimeck: South has a "prime" 4 count here on this bidding|pg||
nt|minimeck: but a tough ask perhaps :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  North and East would make nice 5@c.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|uni_dennis: not sure why N did not start with a take-out DBL|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: now south hasn't shown fit yet|pg||
nt|minimeck: :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Some people tend not to bid after !n opening, but North is "under hammer".|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot it in spades at least (finessing @sK is on).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, 4@sXE.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But that contract might go down on accurate defense.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think these boys play 15-17 nts but Hung likes his 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but het guesses right here in letting them play 4@h|pg||
nt|minimeck: With the 3rd heart setting up, will not be under any pressure here, will make 5 :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Despite having 33 points between them, E/W have no slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome and welcome back!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer will know where is the majority of hcps, but she doesn't know about 2-2 distribution in clubs.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Seems normalish, but the kind of chances the us will like to see available|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There might be a 6@s without a spade lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am sorry: 6@c.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is no safe diamond ruff for N-S, as West is only doubleton in diamonds.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Defense didn't slipped here, taking their fast spade winners.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oni tam maj¹ niezwyk³¹ pamiêc - ci¹gle robi¹ te same b³êdy |pg||
nt|lukasz1982: :)|pg||
nt|asya13: should be a push board|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In such a case we preserve @hK and @dK as entries to pick up spades.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer will pick up clubs, the reason is that North is doubleton and it is easier to continue them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: other room in 6@h too on bd 3|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @d lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: SRY ,the computer deosn't work|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If you would like to watch more tables, open more windows and use:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, board 3, they are also in 4@h, so it is a likely push.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The advantage of @hJ9xx can be seen, but can be finessed.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c asked for a 5 card major and 3@d denied it|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yeah, as soon as one Jeng gets in, they'll lead a @S,  now allowing N to make 5|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  not*|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The best lead is a diamond, but East will never enjoy them.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  @h76 are very useful on this deal|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  we dont see any comparisons here, but 7-2 too brazil after 2 boards, 2@s= on board 2|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: jak juz mowilem, patrza troche krzywo|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, life might be easy when holding 5-5-3-0 distribution|pg||
nt|malipivo:  with two aces in it :)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  N wopuld bid the same with a little cl instead of thet q|pg||
nt|minimeck: Indeed, north has to bid 4@s on many of those similar types of hands|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason is that @hAQ are played.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  First finessing should be in hearts, it will provide entries for finessing in spades.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Next opportunity is to ruff a club later in the play, it also provides an entry.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|malipivo:  Or one imp for Argentina if they find some overtricks and they should and there is no spade lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If diamonds were 6-3, declarer would be in trouble, but today is not that day.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is in 4@h, a spade lead.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lukasz1982: tu znowu mamy wzrok lewoskosny|pg||

nt|lukasz1982: bo nawet przebitka jest od lewy|pg||
nt|kania12:  mozna przypuszczac ze to EW doszly do 5T:)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is makeable now: 1 loser in @s, @h and @d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a without a diamond lead, if played from West.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hearts are friendly for declarer, they split 2-2.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West holding 4 hcps has no use for East, but 5 spades does.|pg||
nt|poohbear: so West has denied a 4 card major cause he would have showed it and all we know about declarer is he doesnt have a 5 card major|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|johnjones:  The defense appears to have 5 D and 2 S before declarer can get in|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even a low heart lead gives up a trick: @hT is above @hJ.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Or rather below.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A heart lead looks is friendly, as declarer holds all the spots: @hT98 and may finesse West's honors or win the fourth best with one of those spots.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|malipivo:  Our attention goes to diamonds, which is crucial on this deal.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  declarer may try to steal one club trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@C = transfer advance i expect|pg||
nt|jafa: slam makes on a non spade lead|pg||
nt|jafa: can play KH then run the 8|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  That's true, now that I look at it.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Hard to find a @S here though|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  @S lead*|pg||
nt|malipivo:  That second spade loser will disappears on the fifth club. |pg||
pc|h9|nt|malipivo:  Declarer may even duck this to avoid dangerous opponent (East with diamonds).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other table made 3@s+1, so this is a big hand for Italy.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|minimeck: Somewhat conservative by hung with this monster|pg||
nt|minimeck: the other table's west opted to pass initially and on a strong club auction and negative diamond they simply jumped to 4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  Declarer will soon finesse in hearts to avoid dangerous opponent (South).|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Spades are friendly too as breaking 3-3.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1 off here as well|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense running out of gas really fast here|pg||
nt|minimeck: If 2@d promised a non-bust|pg||
pc|cK|nt|johnjones:  North has 7 stone cold tricks.  He can play for 3-3 C or the HA onside for 8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|malipivo:  Heart continuation is expected here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is getting endplayed in two suits.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  even ducking is not stopping declarer from making (double dummy)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but getting him to trouble|pg||
nt|malipivo:  operator: 6@h perhaps?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *are placed nicely.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|galallie:  board three the other table was down 2|pg||
nt|galallie:  at 3spades|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yep, misdefense accumulates|pg||
nt|adonis18:  anyway the slam is percentagewise too low|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|poohbear: only the @d king will score|pg||
nt|poohbear: and we can claim|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lukasz1982: aj, jednak nie od lewy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|keylime:  Might be able to arrange an endplay here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even after @dT9 East is covering and securing a trick in diamond suit.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|coolbeans:  This was a good route too|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|malipivo:  if North covers, declarer has to play @dQ and discard a club|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and ruff a club|pg||
nt|malipivo:  To be able to get back to hand for last round of finesse.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  now 8@h is blocking the suit and he might be forced to do that anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  spades are no longer helping as an entry thanks to that duck|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Now making 6|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well played by N|pg||
pc|d4|nt|minimeck: Completely agree, it's not really a reasonable one to bid, certainly 30 imps is not a margin big enough to "look" for slams like that early in the set|pg||
pc|d8|nt|keylime:  A@c, K@c, club exit. |pg||
nt|malipivo:  There was no inference in bidding, so likely to play @hT.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Declarer hoped for @hJx in South's hand.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: curious bidding at the other table, where North cue-bid six diamonds, got six spades from partner and bid seven anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  good morning|pg||
nt|dburn: but it makes sense - since partner did not bid six hearts, maybe everything he had was in clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results for all three series here:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  England currently standing 3rd, Poland currently standing 4th. We are watching Youngsters.|pg||

nt|poohbear: Netherlands are crushing Canada thru 3 boards . Almost a max already|pg||
nt|poohbear: Israel small lead over USA2|pg||
nt|poohbear: Magic number for Israel is 374 in the standings. If they get that they cant be caught|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even 4@s looks makeable as N-S are holding all the spade spots.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@h depends on not losing 3@hs and a @s|pg||
nt|poohbear: they will play 4@H|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to the slamland!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Both red suit small slams are possible on this deal.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  7@c/@dX is a sacrifice for E-W for any slam found.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not going to be so easy for England after North opened with an artificial bid instead of a natural one|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is not risking and passes.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 7.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If passing this, 2 imps to China.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is risky as game may be missed on some 10-11 HCPs.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: convention cards of all pairs are here: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/wbf/2012YouthTaicang/default.asp|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, preference of 5-3 over 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Not necessarily. Finding the killing lead there is tough to ask|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We see 6@h/@s for N-S, if there is no club lead you are making a grand.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|dburn: not that I blame him|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We see 6 fast winners and some will be done for the 7th.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *work|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it might be interesting to see 3!n E-W losing only 4 aces|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sAJ were onside, @dJ as well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, it is a theory|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3 tens on this board were helping a lot|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and 3 nines as well|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  likely that brazil will be in 3nt on board 4, after all they do have 26hp|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: zdecydowanie tak|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Some days we will be in 4@s making, but today is not the day.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Some multi gadgetry here, european players likely to be more familiar with the followups :) |pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are losing 2 spades a diamond and maybe a club.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Some kind of pass or correct with preference to hearts i suppose|pg||
nt|minimeck: Looks like a pen x and a natural 2@c bid here|pg||
nt|minimeck: Hard to guess their methods here, west's double very likely takeout for the majors or something along those lines|pg||
nt|malipivo:  At first glance: there is no slam as we are missing two aces (E-W).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There are 5 losers in a spade contract E-W.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South cannot ruff a club and repeated finesse can be applied against North (@sQ).|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is another slammish hand, but they are missing @cAK.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I don't like 6 card suits in 1NT so it always pleases me when it gets punished|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse is possible in clubs, but there is not enough transportation.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  In the meantime, declarer went down on Board 2 after a diamond lead.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n would be nice contract on this board.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  If more of West's points were in @S, 3 would have been a effective bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  I always have a good feeling when after pard opens a 1 bid, I have possibly more points than them. There's a certain comfort that goes with it.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Diamonds provide three possible discards in clubs, so if, by an accident, the would get to 6@d, it is going down.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|malipivo:  7@d may force N-S to 7@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West didn't buy it and didn't cover with queen.|pg||
nt|minimeck: or a game try for either major it seems |pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's hope defence will cash their club winner.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@d asks partner to bid his best major|pg||
nt|galallie:  Yes, but making and bidding a slam is usually a push or a good board|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If they are considering 4@h, is shall go down soon.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 3@h GF 5-5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason is that hearts are providing enough winners for club discards.|pg||
nt|minimeck: will still be ok, with east only having 2h :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I see it being a push, but then again, I could be wrong|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  And often, I am wrong :)|pg||
nt|galallie:  this contract is about as icy as it gets|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well, he knows where the @C finesse will be|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Push on the slamn board|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  slam*|pg||
nt|galallie:  you were right :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other table is playing 4@sW.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  The Swedes appear to be playing that 3C would be a high level reverse and show extras.  That is a very sensible agreement.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Other table had a very lengthy, relay auction to the excellent contract of 6@d.|pg||
nt|kania12:  trzeba liczyc na pomoc|pg||
nt|minimeck: it seems once South gets word of the 5th heart it becomes off to the races|pg||
nt|adonis18:  !A and....a tough guess|pg||
nt|adonis18:  @hA|pg||
nt|minimeck: Definetely some work to do in the slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  He had a Precison 2C bid available - it would have worked better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  EW clearly play very constructive preempts|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: jednak raczej nie bedzie zapisu dla nas|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @hQJ provide one entry to South.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is nice and cozy 3!n.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is nice 5@c or 5@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@d would go down: a club, a club and a club ruff.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime:  I agree; bidding 3@c here if you're a pattern bidder, causes problems due to the room once takes to show a club suit. I myself would rather rebid 2@h as a waiting call here then the 3@c bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it might|pg||
nt|poohbear: So this should be easy as declarer should play a @h to the 9 as his first play . The Jack pops second time so no guess|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@d would be risky: we need one ruff in spades and also to finesse against @dJ.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This sacrifice is effective even against a game contract, even when three down.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: but they'll get some back here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with 5-4 they bid 2@C first and then Smolen (2@c-2@D//3@h as 5@S-4@h and 3@s as 5@h-4@s)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@s doesn't seem right to me. E has a good hand for slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In North had @hKx South hand would be entryless on accurate defence.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If @hK played, defense ducks.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  That ruff might be avoided using hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If heart attack continues, @sQ will get a trick eventually.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n is cold, I believe.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|johnjones:  A spec messages me they do play 3C as a high level reverse - thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  North's hand should be prime now, and South with four shiny bullets might take a stab at grand here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4-1 diamond break coupled with the heart position hurts the chance for grand here a bit.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A grand is excellent without a trump lead, but iffy with a trump lead|pg||
nt|keylime:  You'd need entries, which at 7 on a trump lead becomes perilous.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec tells me they choose a natural sequence, but had relays available|pg||
nt|johnjones:  If that is the case, that shows excellent judgement because it put weight on the KD|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we may count a lot of tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe it should have done|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if W had a singleton @c you only need to find @hQ|pg||
nt|sliynk: he needs to be careful not to lead @HT as then a spade can be ducked and a ruff given with @H7|pg||
nt|poohbear: you there griff?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Although in reality as you say, looks to be purely the trump guess in practice, by attacking clubs seems normal|pg||
nt|adonis18:  you ruff one spade, trow 3 spades on clubs, Heart Ace and then the guess:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Looks like no queen ask available here, south might just have to bid it :) |pg||
nt|minimeck: According to kit the percentage play is heart to ace heart to 10 of course, I will not argue can pick up Kjxx or jxx |pg||
nt|minimeck: For these kind of situations, it would be intriguing for us to have the live video feed like some of the bermuda bowl tables, how smoothly players play to the trick etc, the table ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: feel aspect|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In 6@d defense must be careful to cash exactly one trick from each major suit.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  fast winner counting: 1-2 hearts, 6 diamonds and two 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he will try it anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|keylime:  And the T too. Both prime cards here.|pg||
nt|minimeck: so the swing will be determined by the play in the other room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Otherwise E-W are making it.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3 spades + 1 heart + 5 diamonds.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|minimeck: Well sorted out by EW here, hung certainly liked his hand on the auction|pg||
pc|h7|nt|keylime:  Nice natural auction here to a likely push. Well done.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Which might be found with relays, but sometimes relays run out of room to find all exact cards.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially with pinpointing 5-5 hands. The frequencies are not as friendly as the 5431 hands.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I like South's decision to go natural, but think he wimped a little in not bidding the grand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a fair game here, reached after the opening instead of preempt. Needs 3-2 trumps and @hA onside, or some defensive help|pg||
nt|minimeck: This lead will help simplify any entry issues on this hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Good point|pg||
nt|keylime:  West has made a nice lead here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer doesn't know clubs are 3-3 and that hearts are not 5-2. So entry management will be important.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Good point by the specs, if north had raised to six, there would have likely been a problem :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: the heart has been guessed, 13 to usa|pg||
pc|d3|nt|malipivo:  Another opportunity was to steal a club winner: leading a low club from North and hoping that ace won't be played at first round.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defence is ducking from time to time to get more information/signals from partner.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If low @h played, defense wins with @hA and @hK is blocking a heart suit.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|johnjones:  He'll be happy to not lose a trump trick though.|pg||
nt|keylime:  16 board segments for the Youth Teams in the RR.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  without a D lead it will make 5|pg||
nt|kania12:  dama kier?|pg||
nt|asya13: Not good defence by east west|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Lucky for W, his ruff would have added no tricks|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|malipivo:  This is exactly our story.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  No, he can pitch his Club on the high Diamond when he plays low after W ruffs|pg||
nt|asya13: oh okay i see :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|uni_dennis: 1NT overcall very agressive here with just 14hcp, no real suit and only Qxx in @h |pg||
pc|d8|nt|keylime:  Playing under Cat 3 of the WBF regs, so no Brown Stickers or HUMs (Highly Unusual Methods).|pg||
pc|dT|nt|malipivo:  and one more heart to the Polish team|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a diamond ruff coming, well done.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kluk: Rozgrywka jakas absurdalna|pg||

nt|malipivo:  welcome|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Never seen a 9 card suit in the tournament yet|pg||
nt|galallie:  i saw one|pg||
nt|galallie:  9 diamonds to the KT|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  No harm in playing small|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: znou cos/kto wisi?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is no entry in South's hand, so squeeze against East looks impossible.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Oh, yes I did, now to think of it|pg||
nt|galallie:  this should be a competetive auction|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I was watching Italy vs. France with that hand|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The French made 5@DX, while the French at the other table made 5@H|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  If they break 3-3, so be it|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Mozart's music for my ears: a slam zone!|pg||
nt|galallie:  maybe not as much if the vulnerability was reversed. since EW have a minor suit sacriface |pg||
nt|coolbeans:  3NT = Gambling with an outside stopper|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Hard call for W here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is easy for us to spot the right play.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dburn: Poland clearly have a game plan - overcall 4@d on every hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 7@s and 7@c both very good contracts|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  What if E's suit is @C? Then a pass is correct|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  5@D will make with the @H finesse onside|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is no slam for slam fans: we are missing an ace and only one finesse is working.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We shall see what level of risk they are taking.|pg||
nt|dburn: seems to be working well so far|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@C their only strong opening|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hackenbush: treacherous 4@h here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, board 5: they are in 1!nN.|pg||
nt|poohbear: good slam here NS|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Hopefully, N/S get to 6@S. Getting to 7 missing a keycard is a terrible bid, but will also make|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's land in nice and cozy 4@s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  5@s might be on as double finessing in clubs is working|pg||
nt|kluk: Mam nadzieje:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 6@d will be 4 off only|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@C only contains strong hands, so pass on 5@d and now on 6@d will be forcing|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but think they haven't discussed this very much|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A slam requires one of the finesses.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|keylime:  They got an overtrick there so tied after 5. This room is two boards behind now; how much time are they allocated - 8.5 min/board?|pg||
nt|galallie:  7 diamonds is down three, making it a good sac if they find 6spades. but it might also push them to 7|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome Cam Shunta, former Junior international. |pg||
nt|goon1407: Thanks Matt|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: would pass or DBL on 5@d show interest to play something|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: pass on 6@d shows a hand to play (dbl would be penalty, usually BAL, semi-bal)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: although pass on 6@D will show interest in bidding, i don't know if Westerbeek thinks his @s 8xxx is enough to do so|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Scoreboard shows -1, it means that operator might get lost the actual play.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Good pass by W. He knew what he was starting if he cam back in the auction|pg||
nt|galallie:  crazy they stopped at four|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I feel for Roger here. I wouldn't know what to bid after 4@S|pg||
nt|adonis18:  a borderline save in 5@d:)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|vugraphzjy: SRY,the network is too poor.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 8 imps for israel on bd 5 as 2@c went 3 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: .|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and if the slam goes down?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  one losing heart is going away on @dA, two more on club ruffs|pg||
nt|MolvaM: chopin's funeral march?  :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But the @hK is a problem.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is slammish hand, but we are missing two aces.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 5: it could be serious double digit if N-S bid&play a slam.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is a risky double dummy slam in 6@c or 6@s played by East.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Possible 8-imp swing coming.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  any voters for slam?|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: tu sie chyba nic wielkiego nie dzieje - trzeba troche uwazac na komunikacje, ale jest Jx pik jak by co|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|malipivo:  Welcome!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi pavel|pg||
nt|malipivo:  On this deal, @hA first and then a low towards @hQ would work, but that's double dummy play.|pg||
nt|galallie:  the 4spades bid did sort of stop the auction|pg||
nt|minimeck: A perfectly normal 3nt here, the clubs, however, simply do not run :x likely pretty flat , will shift to spades here|pg||
nt|minimeck: most likely|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  N gets away with murder here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, it is a risky contract, the other room is playing 3@cW.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  On a lucky day 4H might make an overtrick, but not today.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This would be a risky one, but we may expect to see it at some tables.|pg||
nt|galallie:  exactly|pg||
mb|3S|nt|uni_dennis: in the open room padon made a take-out dbl over 3@d lifting NS to 4@d, but that was still an easy make|pg||
nt|minimeck: this hand is certainly quite unfriendly, very well might limit declarer to 3 trumps and two aces|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  This Australian team is possible our best for many years. The culmination of some very hard work by the guys. They all have several years of international experience at U26 level.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We can spot that @cK will fall down, so even 5@h sould go down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  On this deal a low heart from West to @hT is working.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @s98 are useful cards as trumps might be 4-2 or even worse.|pg||
nt|minimeck: looks pretty flat, 3nt other table|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am not able to find the 9th trick so far.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may watch more tables using more windows and:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|poohbear: as well as at the top levels in Australia|pg||
nt|minimeck: however, edgtton can see that the dummy and it's clubs will be dead, so no hurry|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Running score of the finals and runner-ups:|pg||
mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  However, 3@S may not be forcing|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  W made it hard on them, and he should be congratulated for it|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  In this case, declarer may try to drop @hK.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  A diamond lead wouldn't be nice as it also kills one transport to West hand.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  meaning to play a low @h followed by a low heart|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Nicely bid at both tables: 4@h.|pg||
nt|minimeck: maybe 1 imp or so here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Thanks to @hT it can be played also from West, if guessing position of @hJ and @hK in a right way.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|johnjones:  Another sensible decision by North this time.  The H values aren't working, so he stayed off a direct raise.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So nice bids here|pg||
nt|keylime:  Their teammates going two off red in the other room, makes this important to make +140 to cover some of the loss.|pg||
nt|keylime:  In the other room, South overcalled a strong NT with a multi 2@d overcall, which drove W/E into 3NT.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The other room was down 2 in 3NT, which definately doesn't get the "sensible" award, although Multi is tough to deal with|pg||
nt|keylime:  Ten tricks are available here for South. The heart will jettison a club and the K@s is in the slot.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect that N/S in the other room maybe playing Multi-Landy or something similar.|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a transnational final|pg||
nt|poohbear: for Nabil|pg||
nt|minimeck: Risky, however, if south had a 4th diamond|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The right play in spades on this board is to lead @sJ from East.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|johnjones:  For American  (ACBL) spectators, there is no written defense allowed in this competition|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Down 2 will be a push with the uppercut|pg||
pc|d8|nt|minimeck: What would you choose the west hand on this auction cam?|pg||
nt|minimeck: to lead*|pg||
nt|goon1407: I think its a really tough lead choice initially, |pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South might bid 4@d, just to say he is having support, leading from KJT is not easy.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: East thought that West might hold a hand with long @hs and W thought/hoped that 6@h would show a good 5-card|pg||
pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  If slam goes down, I should congratulate opponents of setting me down.|pg||
nt|poohbear: We have 5 players in this tournament that played in the transnationals finals. West ( Edgtton ) and 4 Israelis|pg||
nt|poohbear: beat out many world famous players along the way|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  But if W found that E had @D, they may have reached their game|pg||
pc|s5|nt|MolvaM: well @hA first is a nice safety play|pg||
nt|poohbear: Israel has dropped behind the Netherlands in the all important run for first in the standings|pg||
nt|goon1407: with a snap 3nt by dwyer, I am inclined for some sort of major lead.|pg||

nt|goon1407: but... with N/S 1nt's frequently having a five card major, its a difficult lead choice.  |pg||
pc|d9|nt|malipivo:  From our perspective it is easy to see everything.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: It helps when you have everything in writing. Pathetic|pg||
nt|keylime:  And Roland, in our mid-chart events, we can play any defense over 1NT, without any disclosed defenses.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The ACBL is ridiculous in its treatment of Multi defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Outside the US you have to remember stuff. We call bridge a mind game|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: they play wolff sing off bid over 2nt here, forced to 3c, 3d is relay, forced to 3c, 3d is relay.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|uni_dennis: but in a way strange by W. he wanted to play 6@s opposite some fit, but now E bids 6@h he believes it can only show a good suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, one more advantage for declarer.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|keylime:  Yet, xfers over natural 1 club opening demand a written defense, and that is a lot easier to cope with.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Nice contract based on 14-13 HCPs.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: a kib warned about the 2@c opener. 1@s would have been easier|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: as you can bid your 2 suits|pg||

nt|malipivo:  We believe that declarer played @hA, but never mind.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Nice job!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It was a risky slam. Next board.|pg||
nt|poohbear: so both sides missed thslam and the board is flat|pg||

nt|poohbear: interesting 4@h here|pg||

nt|poohbear: declarer CANT make|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Results and running scores for all series:|pg||
mb|1D|nt|uni_dennis: 2@d 18-19 bal, but again a 17-count|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: although this one looks like 18|pg||
nt|minimeck: The Joe grue notrump here by owen :)|pg||
nt|goon1407: Kevin was a little aggressive with 3nt, but with such a solid 6 card suit, I think its a good bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Hey we're back!!!|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Nice defense on a tough layout - 12 more for Australia|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if W didn't bid 3@D here he would be on lead against 3NT likely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: you are watching match 16|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the round robin consists of 19 matches|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@s would go down if defence cash their @h+@c winners.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 5, they are in 4@s.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It might easily go down!|pg||
nt|poohbear: what do you guys think of Neg dbl vs 2@h by North?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  1@C = 17+|pg||
nt|minimeck: yea, the other table didn't upgrade to 1nt so they were not getting to game|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I meant 5 IMPs, forgot it went both ways|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to the slamland!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
mb|1S|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 8.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This hall be a nice and cozy 4@h E-W.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but NS will get to 5@c now|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h should go down as well.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for results http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I'd bid 2H.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I like it too as long as I can get out in 2NT|pg||
nt|galallie:  4diamonds? but that would show support in hearts, and an X while it re opens the bidding does nothing to describe his hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: This 1nt here is likely to get NS way overbid , unless north is planning on doubling 2@h for pen|pg||
nt|asya13: nice of east to pull|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The score is now 14-13 USA 1. The carryover is for Israel|pg||
nt|asya13: west*|pg||
nt|minimeck: 1nt 3nt at other table, a tough lead problem for ns|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h N-S is a nice and cozy contract.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|malipivo:  Poland has crossed 42-imp difference, so at the moment it is 25-4 VP.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so after tomorrow evening, the first 8 ranked teams will proceed to the quarter finals|pg||
nt|goon1407: I think Dwyer was trapping|pg||
nt|minimeck: I agree, it is unsure their methods over the 2@d 1 major|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We are enjoying momentum of seeing scores from the other table.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and that's an interesting contract|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Yes.  A better method might be to play 2C to show a (possibly weaker) heart hand and 2H to show a good hand with clubs.|pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps double should be cards|pg||
nt|malipivo:  1!n for E-W.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|malipivo:  But the battle is not over.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: rdbl is?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would not like to be in 3!n E-W.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I like that. |pg||
nt|poohbear: As long as I dont have to remember it :P|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  1@H= 8-10 I believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: they may have set a record for time to cross it, as well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results for all three series here:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  any voters for a slam?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I see slams everywhere, I bid them first and then I think about them. :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sK is offside, but diamonds may be developed fast enought if played from South hand.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the results are at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  :D|pg||
nt|galallie:  board 6 ended up being a push|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  S just bid 4@H, and swoosh|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  That could have been a momentum starter for the US|pg||
nt|galallie:  another slam hand, with some luck|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Roger's in the tank debating between 4@S and looking for 6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@dX would be three down, so there is no sacrifice.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|malipivo:  It is touch work.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Risky 6@h is on as @cQ would be dropped.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  RR1 results saw the home team, Israel, Netherlands, and both USA teams score heavily in the VP column.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: DBL take-out|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NS escaped the DBL in the open room as W rebid 2@c, so 3NT EW there|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@c is a safe contract.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *tough|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like declarer needs to finesse for @sKQ inside|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I haven't check all the CCs, but I know where they are.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which actually works|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The cool thing about Precision is that plenty of bidding room is left for slam investigation|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  However, N needs the right 8-10 HCP to make this slam|pg||
nt|goon1407: Another tough hand to lead from|pg||
nt|minimeck: A good point also by specs, north likely percieves west to have spades and was planning on making a takeout x|pg||
nt|minimeck: after the pass/correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: cards are right for trump elopement|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: declarer might play W to have @sQ for his overcall|pg||
nt|minimeck: A reasonable lead here, don't think he was ever considering a heart|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The @S game requires a lot of cards to be in the right place. The other table got there though|pg||
nt|minimeck: Need to avoid the spade lead, |pg||
nt|minimeck: neither major suit lead is particularly attractive, but a1083 looks a bit worse perhaps, heart lead at other table|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are having a different story at this table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Poland youngesters were having great first half yesterday, but losing slightly the second.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but the problem are hearts itself|pg||
nt|poohbear: Looks like East took West's dbl of 2@s as takeout|pg||
nt|poohbear: In that case West is SUPER aggressive|pg||
nt|minimeck: meanwhile the other table's EW is also playing 3nt, doubled... usually not good when both tables are playing the same contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: power cut just now |pg||
pc|cK|nt|malipivo:  I mean vice versa.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, England may start the long road back here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, take @dK with an ace and finesse everything against North|pg||
nt|poohbear: oops|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Uh oh|pg||
nt|malipivo:  :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and :( I am fair to both teams.|pg||
nt|ritong: omg|pg||
nt|ritong: can t believe it|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@s is a fine contract and it makes.|pg||
nt|minimeck: and 12 more for the usa it looks like|pg||
nt|malipivo:  For all slam fans: this is not the case.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Nothing new, leading from Jxxx always costs a trick|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This should make with an overtrick soon.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kluk: duzy umiar w zamknietym:)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kluk: I beda plusy!|pg||
nt|galallie:  understanable sign off at 4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is no slam again, there is sure heart trick and even if repeated finesse against @dQJ is working, there is also one sure club loser: but that is going away on forth diamond.|pg||
nt|minimeck: A@s a real flyer here, gets what it deserves imo|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If E-W wouldn't find later diamond lead.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: at the moment italy is 7th and singapore is 9th ranked|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but counting points he may place all hcp's with south|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he is afraid that the @h finesse is not on as well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, indeed, so the endgame will be interesting|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *fourth|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have got double digits on Boards 4 and 5.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|malipivo:  As defence can attack only one suit, risky 3!n was on.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so this is one of the critical matches|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but there are 3 more matches (16 boards each) tomorrow|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is making this contract and another push.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Theoretically speaking in 6@h: you draw trumps and develop clubs for spade discards.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|malipivo:  Very risky 6@s is on.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Noble of you.  I guess at this stage I am too --- although only because for the Aussies the result of this match is likely to only make the difference between 2nd and 3rd|pg||
pc|sA|nt|malipivo:  but it would be down.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now cant stop south from gaining the lead in spades|pg||
pc|s3|nt|uni_dennis: E showing neutral with his 2nd @d, another indication about @sQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so will go down|pg||
pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  declarer is avoiding hearts|pg||
nt|malipivo:  this may cost the contract|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|galallie:  6 requires the 3-3 club break|pg||
pc|s4|nt|coolbeans:  3-3 Spade break, 3-3 Club break, and Spades to be positioned correctly|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Very low percentage|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It'd be interesting to see results from other tables.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @s8 is not a winning card now, so we are back to that overtrick.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|key1809: ok|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Here we are, they are in slam paradise!|pg||
pc|hT|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|MolvaM: to make it, he needed to win the first diamond|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Or the Jack to fall 4-2 or 5-1|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is also development of @h-@c squeeze against East, let's watch it closely.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|coolbeans:  I'm not sure if that's above 50% or not|pg||
nt|malipivo:  10-imps back to Poland.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: italy is 20 VP ahead of 8th denmark curently so this match is more critical for singapore|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gruffydd:  If Australia are playing Italy tomorrow (possible) then the gloves are off!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|malipivo:  This battle is not over!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: south waits happily and patiently|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer can make an overtrick if he guesses to endplay West. He will have a reasonably good count on the hand by then . AND it is worth an imp :P|pg||
nt|galallie:  yes, im not sure either|pg||
nt|minimeck: To a more interesting question, what would you bid over 1@s with the west hand|pg||
nt|goon1407: I think in order to make this one Owen had to take deep finess at trick 1 and make a quasi safety play in spades to preserve entrys|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, West is endplayed for the 10th, right?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think Netherlands grabs Italy if available|pg||
nt|poohbear: for 11th|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  If he cashes the last trump and 2 clubs ... yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|keylime:  T@d now a threat card|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Playing 2NT - 3NT as something other than natural is becoming increasingly popular|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he may try to duck a heart once to put more pressure on South|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  seems an unlikely line as it risks the contract, though :D|pg||
nt|poohbear: but may misguess if he plays for 5-4-2-2 |pg||
pc|d6|pc|h9|nt|malipivo:  he will be happy if only one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: W hide his C|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2 extra rounds of trump might tell him something|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why North at the other table responded 1NT to 1@d, especially since in Polish style 1@d always shows at least four|pg||
nt|poohbear: He knows from the lead @ss are 5-2|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Roger probably downgraded KJ of @H. Never a good doubleton to hold|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: How young are the Jeng brothers?  13 and 11?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But again, it is more double dummy play.|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2@h is what your instinct tells you but you're a bit light|pg||
nt|goon1407: I think I pass|pg||
pc|c9|nt|keylime:  They might be using some form of Muppet Stayman?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14 and 12 I am told|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The USBF site doesn't say, but they are young and look even younger in person.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Richard Jeng became a Life Master at the age of 10 in 2010!|pg||
nt|keylime:  And Adam Kaplan from my home state of  Florida wasn't much older when he got his. Now he's a Diamond Life Master I believe.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2 ovetricks needed for 6th imp.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh, she is going to be blocked in hand, she needed to overtake this trick and try first round of repeated finesse in dia.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|malipivo:  West is being endplayed in hearts|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|malipivo:  if diamond returned, North will be endplayed in hearts|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @d7, known as beer card, is not going to have its true value on this deal|pg||
nt|goon1407: your honors in @h and @d|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|MolvaM: well if he places everything to south. why not?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|goon1407: are pretty trashy for vul|pg||
pc|hA|nt|malipivo:  And it turns out to be guessing in hearts|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|nt|gruffydd:  No dice|pg||
nt|poohbear: didnt want to risk 5-4-2-2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: wackwitz did well to play @hQ early|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results and running scores for all three series here:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@C puts a lot more pressure on than 3@c, but E has a simple 4@h with his flat hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and now S hopes they did wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: looks like they will reach a thin 3nt|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theory a spade loser might get away on club winners if spades aren't attack first.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Club ruffing is not going to work for defence as South is also singleton in clubs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am mistaken here, thank you for spotting this from spec:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  you can only make 3 discards, not enough... from 5:)|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Does that make them first pick off the menu?|pg||
nt|poohbear: running scores. Top 8 qualify    http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|galallie:  do you know what determined the carryovers?|pg||
nt|goon1407: 6@d makes here|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is a long match, the key for the US is to try to continue to play strong & steady, if you try and hit a homerun every pitch, you're likely to strike out|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is our first double digit, for Netherlands.|pg||
nt|ntmon: hello to everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|frankaus: this looks to be a make|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this lead makes it interesting|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: defense can now set up a @s before @ds are good, but might just lose 1@s 1@h 1@d|pg||
nt|malipivo:  that's very true, a @c7 is not a winner|pg||
nt|poohbear: depends on whethe rthere is carryover and who gets in|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Carry over = half of head-to-head result from the round robin, capped at some amount or other? Have I remembered correctly?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I think it may have been how the teams did against each other in the round robin|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I originally thought it was seeding, but that doesn't look right|pg||
nt|minimeck: Any pair who bids 6@d on these cards deserves a thorough mental examination :)|pg||
nt|goon1407: its cold. if you know about the 9 card diamond fit and the 8@c club fit... I could be sold|pg||
nt|goon1407: I think its unattainable after Owen's 4@h bid, however.|pg||
mb|p|nt|asya13: 4sp should be the contract e-w will be in|pg||
nt|malipivo:  welcome!|pg||
nt|ntmon: let me join with somewhat sleepy commentary|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@d is a limit for N-S.|pg||
nt|ntmon: now 5 am in Europe|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 6: they didn't risk a thin slam, so it is our first flat board in this segment.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|johnjones:  1NT instead of 2S is interesting|pg||
nt|dburn: sensible contract, as is 1@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobry ranek wiernym polskim kibicom|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even 3!n would work well on this board.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|johnjones:  Another push board.  We are watching a low scoring but well played match.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Possibly influenced by their limit opening |pg||
nt|malipivo:  N-S are risking being in 4@s.|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes. If you finished higher in the round robin. Otherwise its 1/3 of the cap|pg||
nt|poohbear: I belief the cap is 48 imps|pg||
nt|poohbear: at least thats the Bermuda Bowl rules|pg||
nt|poohbear: in the meantime NS have a shaky 3NT here|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Nabil is in the tank well and good|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@dX looked down two.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hard to pass 3@ds dbled when partner makes a takeout dbl and you have a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: down 4 on a low @D lead, played from france in youngsters|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think 3NT is a reasonable shot. |pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Nabil is thinking about what to switch to. Any of the three other suits might be right.|pg||
nt|poohbear: unfortunate for Zanasi that partner dbled purely in majors|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, oh yes, I am not blaming him with his next bid.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@h shall be one down.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Look closely at spade holding, this shall be down soon.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hackenbush: EW play precision|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: now it gets interesting with 4@s, 2@h and 2@d tricks already|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now in trouble|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h E-W makes via double dummy play.|pg||
nt|ntmon: i see we had a nice swing on  5|pg||
nt|ntmon: Polish youngsters earned 21 IMPs on  5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Indeed, it could be even worse as N-S had an opportunity to bid&make a slam in a major suit.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: youngsters ranking|pg||
nt|minimeck: Tough call for grossack west here, he has opened light, but let them off the hook here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is not way how to develop diamonds either.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=920&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And it just happened, 4@s-1 on Board 5.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Now that S knows that W has @D, he easily find the lead of the A|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If North had a diamond doubleton, it would be different story as !Q provides a useful entry.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|uni_dennis: can make if he plays on @hs first, then can finesse @h10 and pitch his @C on @Ds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|poohbear: not sure what Edgtton has against his QJ10xxx suit :)|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Possibly Nabil decided that the 2H *might* have been suit-preference, and absent any other indication he went with that.|pg||
nt|poohbear: but now he has an opportunity to switch to his 3rd non suit |pg||
nt|gruffydd:  His suit is a safe switch ... but he has no entries so he'll never enjoy it.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 might have been forced play|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  It can go down if N switches to a @H after getting the ruff|pg||
nt|ntmon: making 6@DX +1 in one and 6@H in other room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Grand slam was also on with a non-club lead.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ryskiel_: nieco pechowo zaczêlimy ten mecz z £otw¹|pg||
nt|MolvaM: east must double that|pg||
nt|poohbear: found it|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  As indeed it was here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 7, N-S are bidding aggresively and buying 3!n.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It was due to @sT.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|keylime:  The bridge on VuGraph has been outstanding lately. The Spingold was gripping, and the Youth Teams already looks great.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  sneaky|pg||
nt|johnjones:  he may have wanted to set the Cs up for tricks though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the other room Padon responded 1@s, then supported @c before bidding 3NT, so @d6 lead there|pg||
nt|z_lasu: tu raczej nie da sie wygrac|pg||
nt|galallie:  it was determined by how they did against one another in the RR match|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Rajkumar should switch to the 10 of @C, and put a hard decision on E|pg||
nt|galallie:  Australia had beat the US 25-3|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  On IMPs or VPs?|pg||
nt|galallie:  Vps|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Then I am not entirely sure what determines the carryover. To me, it's just random numbers :)|pg||
nt|galallie:  IMPs was 9-64 |pg||
nt|malipivo:  @hK cannot be finessed as there is also @hQ.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|poohbear: now a @d shift|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  5C clearly looked discouraging enough!! not sure why Andy (Hung) couldn't play the 7C instead of the 5C|pg||
nt|poohbear: and the defense will have played all 4 suits in the first 4 tricks in 3BT . Rarely see that :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gruffydd:  yes ... all 4 suits played by defense.  Not normally a good tactic|pg||
nt|poohbear: worked well here|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  But quite reasonable on this deal.  This is going in the next Aussie youth bulletin as a peculiarilty!|pg||

pc|sK|nt|malipivo:  OR, a diamond lead.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: france is the group leader but CHinese Taipei lies 11th and needs good scores to get into the first 8 teams|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am a believer that all press is good press :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|keylime:  He's got the ruffing finesse on here now|pg||
nt|keylime:  And the A@h is right|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is risky line.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The battle for overtricks is over.|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Will do Barry. For the current edition which gives a short bio of each Aussie player at the event, see http://www.abf.com.au/youth/bulletins/JulAug12.pdf|pg||
pc|s5|nt|johnjones:  He'll be OK since the HK is a reentry |pg||
nt|malipivo:  It may lead to an ovetrick in OR and an imp to England.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He might go down even in 3@s.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I read that yesterday :) very funny|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  East (Hung) is one of the editors|pg||
nt|poohbear: The alex mentioned is Alex Smirnov from the German national team . He is coaching the Aussie jrs|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: first seat opener no matter how light should take 1-2 tricks normally|pg||
nt|galallie:  it is the results from the RR match, austalia's coach confirmed|pg||
pc|cT|nt|uni_dennis: building his 9th trick in @c here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So swing is coming as they shall make it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: SO the board 7 has translated +1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|malipivo:  And a diamond means a lot of trouble for declarer.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: he clearly is convinced trumps break 5-0, not strange with 4th best lead and @d 4-2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not happening in this match so far|pg||
pc|c7|nt|malipivo:  He would save a heart loser but losing trump control.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If East would play @hK, I will eat my hat.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The 5-4 heart fit looks better than the 5-3 spade fit, but the result will be the same.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  From bad it is turning to be ugly.|pg||
nt|asya13: Making 4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|nt|gruffydd:  meanwhile Declarer is in trouble.  Tried ducking in each suit, but that hasn't got him anywhere|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yes, it's 1/2 the VP difference since Australia is the higher seeded team|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh my!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rossoneri:  For those interested in the systems: http://bit.ly/NCRVxB|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Or approximately 1/2|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  E guessed right on the Club|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|coolbeans:  Yep, I am surprised S didn't give suit preference for @H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|malipivo:  Here they cannot escape a spade loser.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am afraid so.|pg||
nt|galallie:  10 is the max|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|minimeck: Edgton here a bit worried about 4-1 trump, but in the end will have to play the 2nd round|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|malipivo:  But likely a push board.|pg||
nt|dburn: West would not have passed playing a "standard" system, but East is limited to some extent by failure to open 1@c, which he would do with a really good hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|uni_dennis: making now, just losing 1 more @h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|keylime:  Defense trying to score separate trump tricks here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I think south's 3@s was a bit too much|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sJ98 are useful here, it is providing enough tricks even if @hK is misguessed.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|malipivo:  West is going to play a diamond.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can it be right?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lukasz1982: hi|pg||
nt|kluk: Podstawowe prawo brydzowe: Nie wyrzucac lew:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: did he really go down?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Is operator playing differently from players?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is happening from time to time.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|malipivo:  And another diamond.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|malipivo:  China is playing precise defence here, I may say.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|malipivo:  but can be made now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|johnjones:  We appear to be experiencing technical difficulties.  That is an area that rates to get better as the tournament goes along.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  and thank you to the vugraph operators, you are doing an excellent job!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, the other room is down in 3NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  so a swing, but the other way|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: thank you too ,he came back|pg||
nt|malipivo:  That is a board to be discussed for both parties.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so the greedy DBL cost 5 imps|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: slam on a finesse here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @CA needs to be onside|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I love to say this: we are getting to slamland.|pg||
nt|goon1407: Very well played by W|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  N/S can reach a better contract of 3NT here|pg||
nt|asya13: Only fit n-s has is clubs|pg||
nt|minimeck: claim, North might have caused a problem early by switching to a club, but that's a very tough ask |pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is playing 4@cE.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|rensph: @CK|pg||
nt|goon1407: making play in case trumps were 4-1|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2@h N-S making.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Seeing all hands we can say that 4@s is going down.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@h EW and 5@d NS it seems|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But Hawaii (trumps 5-0) may set it one down.|pg||
nt|adonis18:  probably 3 nt and 8 tricks|pg||

nt|galallie:  Id do 1C|pg||
nt|asya13: 3nt is a good contract |pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: 3@d is 10-11 with 3@s or7-11 with 4@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East-South are having a nice slam.|pg||
nt|dburn: but now poor West has been dealt a hand with which he would pass throughtout on any auction|pg||

nt|MolvaM: some play 2NT as showing @d support here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: careless play from declarer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Maybe it went to @dA and spades back (trick 2 and 3).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: france youngster will probably make that one for a gain of 10 imps|pg||
nt|poohbear: South's @ss look like a fit all by themselves :)|pg||
nt|asya13: heh|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2@d here limit with clubs perhaps, North is not going to like his diamond holding|pg||
nt|minimeck: but looks like will probbably try nt anyway|pg||
nt|minimeck: 7 more imps for usa as NS are making 2@D X on the previous hand|pg||
nt|adonis18:  W @d-holding doesn't warrant a lead dbl:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Sure, it is certainly a very wild looking lead director|pg||
mb|d|nt|malipivo:  Neither the Czech Republic nor Slovakia teams are presented at this tournament, so I am crossing my fingers to all the teams. :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but we must recognize Caillliau's creative @cK lead|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Oh wait, it can't with Precision ;)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  1@D is their only choice|pg||
nt|galallie:  Yes, i am a 2/1 player|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @h9 is a key card here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to my favorite subject: a slam zone!|pg||
nt|minimeck: but levy must take it for it's word|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, so would North, except he has to bid|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2NT is 4+@s-fit and INV+|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We see that @cKQ are off but that's all.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hearts are breaking nicely and diamonds are marked.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 1NT was not exteremely accurate there|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Well, we are having another story here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Indeed we should!|pg||
nt|galallie:  started to do Precision with one of my partners :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  1@D = 11-15 with 1+ @D|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It provides additional stopper for declarer.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Who is good in cooking, I might need a chocolate hat. ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  We have a football score.  6-3 one field goal to two field goals.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The symmetry in North-South hand is killing all the possibilities.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: helmich not interested with this hand of course|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pisze pani do redakcji - sz. redakcjo przed turniejem partner uczy³ mnie odblokowania|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The summary of the first half: 20-imp difference, 20-10 VPs in favor of France.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason is that South cannot lead heart to finesse that card.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|johnjones:  A quick down 1|pg||
nt|dburn: here, you would like it if North had a real negative available|pg||
nt|malipivo:  23-7 VPs in favor of China|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and still living opportunity for a swing on this deal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West could bid hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  That's exactly what East needs from him.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Reopening is kind of risky with useless @sQ and 1=4=4=4 distribution.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now East thinks that partner isn't having 4 hearts, it is dangerous thought.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: hi|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to prawda, ale nale¿y æwiczyæ odruchy|pg||
nt|MolvaM: trouble|pg||
nt|poohbear: A relay auction here|pg||
nt|goon1407: easy lead hear for hung|pg||
nt|minimeck: Might need to divine the diamond suit here to make|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The third club will disappear on @hA.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Dbl showed 4+@s and 1@s showed 2-3 @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In a balanced 11-13?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS opens all bal hand 12-14/18-19 with 1@c and then play trf and relays after that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke is usually North and Ida South, right Johan?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This sequence will probably ends in 3@d or 3@h.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NS do not play a strong @c system, so they also start with a strong 2@c (22+)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@D is waiting|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec observing the other room closely: 2 major errors in the defense: Nab's terrible defense against 4@H, did not give partner ruff for 1 down|pg||
mb|4H|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room in 4@h, but I am afraid it is going down.|pg||
nt|dburn: but 4@c is... well, it is not clear that it is even a cue bid|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is just happy he is having strong hand, who wouldn't be? |pg||
nt|dburn: and even if it is, Huber should not be looking at a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 5@d doomed on a @s lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3-imp difference, 16-14 in favor of Argentina|pg||
nt|malipivo:  On of the players must be bid aggressively to get there.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@h was 2-way: either NAT or a NT range, 2@S asked|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@D shows 6+@h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: without a 2nd suit|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I believe 2C is 3-way.  Either Natural GF, Bal GF or an invitational raise in spades.|pg||
nt|galallie:  East heavily upgraded his hand because of the diamond void|pg||
nt|minimeck: See only 6 tricks otherwise |pg||
nt|adonis18:  N got his warnings:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Indeed, if there was any chance to stay out of 3nt they offered it :)|pg||

nt|tez: you can make 6@d but 3 nt imposible|pg||
nt|malipivo:  (with 3 more comparison from the other room)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: france has 3 good boards 7, 8, and 9|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n is nicely placed.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6,7,8 sorry|pg||
nt|goon1407: I think the play in spades is safer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Enjoy this hand, it is going to make.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Any voters for 3!n?|pg||
nt|ntmon: i have to admit i don't like them that much|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  studying 17 and 19 y brother and sister ;)|pg||
nt|dburn: if he wants to raise to 4@h no one would crime him, but 4@c shows clubs, not hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and Illingworth has raised those "clubs", as well he should|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East in Open Room leads @sK.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am told there is no slam.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, very true you are, i wrote that too early|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even if @cA would be in South's hand, she cannot atack hearts.|pg||
nt|adonis18:  the eager doubles gav NS a chance to earn imps|pg||
nt|ntmon: if one of the reasons for 4-card overcalls is to deter opps from bidding 3NT, it can hardly work in junior events :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is no risk in a diamond ruff from opponents as South has also a diamond singleton.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|malipivo:  None players are breathing right now.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even me.|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  The rest I'm not privy too.  We can assume they've found their H fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont think inv in @ss likely since that would make the 2@s bid strange|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I don't know if worth that much of an upgrade vulnerable|pg||
nt|malipivo:  6!n is also a possibility.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is a slammish hand, but!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|uni_dennis: other room 1@d pass 4@h !! by van Lankveld, all pass|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: is this correct?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Leads for N/S are 3/5 vs. suitsa|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  suits*|pg||
nt|minimeck: well sure, he has 2 spade tricks, 2 hearts, a club and the ace of diamonds, will need to make a 2nd diamond|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is a hidden loser in a spade suit.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|malipivo:  And a swing for Costa Rica.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I will rather eat my hat if he plays low.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: w schoolsach 31:20 dla naszych zawodnikow|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: maybe S forgot the system|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: South PASSED|pg||
nt|tez: hýmm|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now we know that Zanasi likes to bid |pg||
nt|MolvaM: still there are only 8 tricks so far|pg||
nt|malipivo:  E-W preserve a diamond attack.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe declarer shld try to steal a heart trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: by playing @hJ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if he wins he can duck a club then|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or he will immediately duck the club and rely on the @s finesse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which doesnt work|pg||
nt|ritong: une entame bien raisonnée, a mon avis|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn: East in Closed Room may be of the same mind|pg||
nt|minimeck: Not the worst slam in the world, trumps 3-0 sinks the boat, NS here likely playing limited openings, so south simply bid 4@s with no slam interest opposite an 11-15, many pairs ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: might use jacoby or simmilar and get to 6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason might be that 3 diamonds cannot be ruffed as spades are 3-0.|pg||
nt|goon1407: simply because if Hung has A@s and anything else, he might have opened. |pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 8: South is playing 2@d.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|malipivo:  3 imps for Poland waveing.|pg||

pc|cK|nt|dburn: and North could be forgiven if he didn't greet that dummy with a heartfelt "thank you partner"|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: choc np. w rozdaniu 6 zbieglo 2@h|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: @hQ is not so good|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south grabs that immediately|pg||
nt|galallie:  East likes his diamond void a lot more when the opps start bidding them|pg||
nt|ritong: on sait que le mort a dit 5@c avec deux cartes, a priori|pg||
nt|asya13: North south has the rest of the tricks now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ntmon: without 5-card suit, the strategy of leading against 3NT is to find a safe lead, lead not giving a trick|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  10-imp swing on the table laying and waiting|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hmmm defensive error|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Nicely bid, let's play it.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: this was a pick-up for the Australian U21s as the Chinese player sitting east lead a @c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  After an attempto to ruff club (@cA), West is getting his heart ruff.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|malipivo:  he will, he is a nice guy :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Developing hearts is not that easy as seems.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer is going to be endplayed.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: N was bidding as in their notes, now trying Exclusion for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: maybe 5d means ASK except d,and south forgot the system|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they blocked the hearts|pg||
nt|minimeck: Several pairs allready have arrived to six, one wonderful aspect of the running scores, can see each board across the field :) |pg||
nt|malipivo:  They know that Italy was behind and they will start bidding thin games and slams.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzjy: sry,I have taken a mistake.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They were aware that hcps probably lay one-sided (1@d bid).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would be interesting to see if south was awake enough to grab the @hJ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They are after lunch, he might easily be! :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Indeed, once he spots the q of spades, should certainly guess it|pg||
nt|malipivo:  What a hand and Italy is back in business.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ciep³o, ciep³o|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Not that much, recalculation...|pg||
nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is interesting to spot position of tens.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer can ruff 8@c with a high heart as hearts are distributed 3-1.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gulczynek: W trzecim król by³by po drugiej stronie i zamiast -17 by³oby +13.|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think the Italians outbid the Aussies here. 3NT looks like a better spot. But breaks are normal so 4@h should make too|pg||
nt|galallie:  his bid was still aggressive though|pg||
pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  good day, welcome!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now bernard waits patiently again to get his @sK|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  the 98 of clubs make this hand very easy. Making 10 tricks for a flat board.  But there is the question of the best way to play hearts to guard against a 4-1 break|pg||
nt|minimeck: now can set up the long spade also, +90 it is it seems|pg||
nt|ritong: et il doit y avoir une raison  surement une courte a @s|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yes, good to set up @D because of the bad Club break|pg||
pc|c4|nt|malipivo:  On regular basis missing a side ace and a trump queen, you are not entering a slam zone without risk, but we are watching a semifinal at the serious tournament.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would prefer safety: a low spade to an ace and another spade.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|malipivo:  but he might try to endplay East for -2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Overtaking?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defense is cooperating, even low and a spade return works for time being.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Or overtaking and a spade return with overruffing potential.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *diamond return|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But club return is also a nice option. :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ryskiel_: rêka 4-4-4-1 jest zawsze nieprzyjemna jak rozgrywa przeciwnik|pg||

pc|h2|nt|cicus: :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I think that North & South are wishing to swap several cards now.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  two rounds of diamonds and a diamond|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: EW cannot end up in 2@c as 1@s-1NT//2@c is a gazilli trick, so will play 2@S presumably|pg||

nt|MolvaM: well, if you believe you have stopper, why shouldt the opponents believe too?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: shouldnt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that was another potentially good board fro france. at least they cant lose on the board and may gain|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  He's trying to figure out from the choice of defensive plays who has the most hearts|pg||
nt|galallie:  that depends on system. also more points in NT than in diamonds, but this isnt match points so it doesnt matter as much|pg||
nt|minimeck: once again same contract at both tables, this time worked out a bit better :)|pg||
nt|goon1407: hah, 1nt is doable. 3nt not so much|pg||
nt|goon1407: what do you bid over 1@c by W here Matt?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks we will see 1!nE.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is also playing 5@s.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is playing 3!nS on board 7.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, even 4-0 in hearts is not a problem as declarer has @hT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  sry private|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer in OR tried @cQ, but it is covered.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  There is no slam, but also 5@c might go down soon.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If we swap @h9-@hT we would have a different story.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is risky 3!n, but it is not easy to find it.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer would duck spades twice and then finesse all the cards in hearts against South.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  1NT FG relay|pg||

mb|3H|nt|malipivo:  and a partscore battle is ahead of us|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT interesting on a @h lead|pg||

nt|cicus: only, he does not have 8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  he doesn't know about that|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd bid up to 3@S I admit|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: another way to end up in 2@S|pg||
nt|asya13: Weak 3sp bid here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It might be even down two catching @hK.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  any voters for 3!n N-S?|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: slammish hand but beware of the diamonds |pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 6, they were in 6@c, making now.|pg||
nt|galallie:  I would see why some people would opt to stay safe and play in diamonds, especially in imps|pg||
nt|galallie:  this board has no prayer|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  W is happy defending this :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  This was just bad luck|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mrdct: need to hook the @h10 here to make|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and going to 4@h?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: defense can make 1@c, 2@h, 1@D, 1@s and a @c ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: for 1 down|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so good lead|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  There's a swing in the bidding here. Edgtton (and Hung) partnership style doesn't rate the west hand as a 2NT overcall (lowest two unbid suits, 5/5).|pg||
nt|sliynk: the word from the people here is if standings stay as they are it will be most likely NED v SING - France v China - Isreal v Italy - AUS v USA with AUS and Isreal in the same half ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We see fast four losers (@s, @h! 2x@c).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south opens spades but no wasted points there against the singleton|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's test if West is not sleeping? a low diamond to @d9, but it is easy for West to cover @d6.|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  Eh, give me one less @S and I agree|pg||
nt|galallie:  with KJTxxx i wouldnt ever consider a t/o double|pg||
nt|galallie:  i think the 3spades and an X in south position is reasonable. but i think im the minority|pg||
nt|minimeck: A standard american 1nt here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is a potential in trump upper cut after a spade lead.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: but South might well have led a trump, not a spade|pg||

nt|MolvaM: can make it if he tests diamonds first|pg||
nt|minimeck: Looks to be another swing for the US brewing up here|pg||
nt|adonis18:  any statistic of the gain or loss on these modern nt-bids with a singleton?|pg||
nt|minimeck: well Rodwell is certainly it's biggest proponent, he would say the percentages are "vastly" in your favor with stiff king|pg||
nt|minimeck: according to him, stiff queen even is close to a coin flip|pg||
nt|minimeck: A tough lead problem for north here, nothing attractive, might try a spade or a diamond i would guess|pg||
nt|adonis18:  but w at the same time makes it hard to bid a @d-slam, if it's there|pg||
pc|h4|nt|uni_dennis: was interesting what to do as south|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: bd 9 4@h -1, so another push|pg||
nt|malipivo:  even now|pg||
nt|kluk: Ake jak wezmie na krola, to sie zorientuje, ze jest gotowe 9 lew wiec chyba zmieni na karo|pg||
nt|malipivo:  How would you like to be in 6@h contract?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I like that. Partner is a heavy favorite to have 6 @H or a monster hand to force u to bid at 4 levelwhen you couldnt bid at 1 level|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East needed a low spade lead from partner.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: NS lead 3rd from even and low from odd|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  W didn't double just in case they could run somewhere|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Go with the known fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: right|pg||
pc|d6|nt|MolvaM: looks to be on the right track|pg||
nt|minimeck: lol! pavel I hope you would use keycard and find you are missing 1 and the queen of trump|pg||
nt|malipivo:  To be in heart slam is a bad idea missing @hAQ.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|keylime:  Very good bidding. Now, will another trump lead come from West?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  (I was thinking 6@d at first glance.)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: would have been happy if I reached that but unless both reds divide 3-2 I would be in trouble|pg||
nt|MolvaM: esp after a club lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Declarer can now afford to duck a spade for communication.  That wouldn't have been possible on  a trump lead.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer will need to be in the moment here and play carefully for the slam. It's easy to let excitement as a well bid hand get to best of you.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  This will be the first swing in the match that doesn't involve undertricks or overtricks|pg||
nt|ianmcc: reprieve|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am sorry, we are in 2@s.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kania12:  brawo|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: przemyslane!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @hJ provides very important entry for playing spades and avoid being blocked.|pg||
nt|minimeck: This looks pretty cold to me with everything splitting nicely|pg||
pc|h5|nt|malipivo:  The other table is frozen.|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer has played himself into down 2 as well|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: teraz dama na jedyna szanse i -2|pg||
nt|poohbear: should have kept another @d|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hackenbush: declarer just has enough time to stay ahead of the tap|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|hackenbush: declarer may have been playing South for 5 spades|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both suits 3-2 means > slam is about 47%|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @hT provides an entry if needed.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so not good odds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well after 3 rounds of hearts you run out of trumps|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and after ruffing the diamonds good, you cant reach dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|galallie:  smart move-- a good general rule is if you cant double another contract by the opps, dont double the one they are currently in |pg||
pc|s5|nt|tez: wd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if you play diamonds befor, you go down immediately with the diamond ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: this might not be best|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other table bought 1@sN.|pg||
nt|gulczynek: Zosta³o nam jeszcze 7 rozdañ. Ju¿ sprawdzilimy, ¿e nawet 6 wystarczy, ¿eby uzbieraæ 42 impy na taryfê.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Roger can't ruff there because he's dead if E has the A of @H, which is most likely the case |pg||
pc|sA|nt|hackenbush: 3 trumps = 3 control units, in Rodwell's terms, while 3 spades need to be knocked out. And declarer has the lead, so he will come out ahead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 9, OR is playing 6@sN.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|minimeck: claim|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A spade now would be nice.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A trump upper cut is still alive.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason is that declarer can ruff a heart or a club return with a low trump.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lukasz1982: moze nie na jedyna :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|gronkvist:  but not so easy to play this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade now is best|pg||
nt|keylime:  A spec has told me this pair is the only one of both the jrs and youngsters to bid the slam. It deserves a good fate.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A spade should played first |pg||
nt|dburn: if North had stuck in the queen of hearts...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so france did well to stop at 4@h|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now will make +2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There has been a heart discard, forcing @sA is safe now.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ryskiel_: Gulczyn wiesz o tym, ¿e jak pies pogryzie cz³owieka to nie jest news...dopiero jest news jak jest odwrotnie:)|pg||

nt|MolvaM: right. it helped when south passed|pg||

nt|poohbear: Israel has 4 boards to pick up about 16 imps to win the RR|pg||

nt|poohbear: Declarer drew an extra trump and that ended her chance to get lucky in @cs if they were bloed|pg||
nt|poohbear: blocked|pg||
nt|asya13: Partner will probably end up correcting to 4hearts|pg||
nt|poohbear: So a new match !|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Precisely defended, well done!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: a rather easy 3NT now with @d 2-2|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  N/S must not be playing Inverted Minors|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  But I still like a 1NT bid there|pg||
nt|poohbear: Its like they speak a whole different language from us :P|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East cannot lead a heart to start finessing @dK.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h should go down one as declarer would lose @hA and three diamonds.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It might be 6@s without blinking an eye.|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@s is natural 8-11 with 5-6 @s|pg||

nt|malipivo:  But it must be in hearts, in spade grand we don't have enough winners in hearts for discards.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jest 3 BA|pg||
nt|tez: 2nt invitational @h|pg||

nt|poohbear: So whoever wins the Round Robin gets to chose it's opponent for the next match from teams 5-8. We suspect there will be carry over based on the RR match played head to head. secon|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: nie- grano 3 bez jednej|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@c a transfer to 2@D, to play there or any INV|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so wackwitz needs to do more than 2@D if he doesn't want to play there|pg||
nt|minimeck: the pre-empter would typically take one bid unless he has a suprise, which here he does, as 3nt looks a likely make won't be too bad here|pg||
nt|poohbear: Second team then picks from the remaining 3 teams and so on|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n is going down two: @hA and four diamonds.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@c should go down as well as 5@d.|pg||

nt|ntmon: good, @S found|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sT987 will work nicely.|pg||
nt|ntmon: W has difficult lead|pg||
nt|ntmon: from all she knows, @H lead comes to most probable declarer tenaces |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|keylime:  2@d would be fourth suit forcing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A risky 6@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They would need a swing of this magnitude.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hi konstatinos|pg||
nt|cicus: W has a nice hand for @Hs so he has to do something other than lazily raising to 4|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We have some options on this deal: finessing @cK or squeezing South in minor suits.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@h will probably make but declarer will have to work hard|pg||
nt|sliynk: 1/2 if you won the match and 1/3 if you lost it capped at 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|poohbear: There will be straight KOs starting at the round of 8|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  2@D probably shows a minimum @S support hand|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  So they can safely sign off at 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  We are seeing good judgement and nice card play from 4 youngsters whose combined aged is 62 (younger than many of us).|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: * i guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after a club lead|pg||
nt|jlall: I would guess that 2@C forced 2@D (that is how they get out in 2@D), and the following 2@S bid shows an invite with 5 spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: 2@h is simply 4+ hearts promising 5@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|johnjones:  Good lead, best declarer can do is -150|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Andy has embarrassment of riches|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sJxx is providing a safety trick for declarer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  An opportunity for Chinese team.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other leads are more friendly to declarer|pg||
nt|sliynk: 4 x 14 boards|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well, S is definitely not accpeting any invites|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  But I think N was way too conservative here|pg||
nt|minimeck: dwyer might have simply corrected back to 2@s, but dug his hole a bit deeper|pg||
nt|asya13: what a knowledgable table|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: westerbeek looking for his best bid: 3@h can be 5, 3@s can be 3, 3N needs better stopper|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good start for the def|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He may try to cash @hA first.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: france, as expected, gets 10 more from board 8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As a part of safety plan.|pg||
nt|goon1407: hard to correct back to 5-1 suit, but sometimes you have too|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|keylime:  Very good lead. Declarer does not have that friendly of splits here, and cards are not well placed either.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  3NT is also an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sort of auctions there's not a lot of point leading @s as partner didn't raise and RHO surely has a robust stopper|pg||

nt|minimeck: Hard to see north avoiding a spade lead here|pg||

nt|adonis18:  :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Although the contract has also been reached at the other table, from the other side|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  Probably a result of the slam; the need to bid a close game to get imps back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3rd and 5th leads, also against notrump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: n  missing, my fault  Konstantinos|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: ranges in natural bidding made this a tough hand to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in strong @c after 1@c E has a GF hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think 3C was better than 3d|pg||
nt|galallie:  I agree. his single K of hearts because more valuable when his partner opens 1heart|pg||
nt|jlall: game is really bad, i think north did fine given that lee will open 5332 10 counts, south could even have a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|minimeck: this lead looks a bit favorable, but east will just have to switch to a trump when in with the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|asya13: :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Great lead by levy, !|pg||
nt|ntmon: @D lead tries to find partner with shortness, sooner or later |pg||

nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||

nt|malipivo:  All three series are playing the same boards, we may compare their results afterwards easily.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe a prob if hearts 3-0 but no need to be too paranoid|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Does anyone know what the Aussies were penalised VPs for? Probably slow play.  This year was the first time ever in our Junior Team Selection we had to threaten them with VP fines for slow play.  An indication of how serious they are taking|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats only good if there is no slam :P|pg||

nt|MolvaM: what to discard?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Watch closely @hT9, those are important cards.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  N-S in the other room bid this hand in a fast way: 3@s-6@s.|pg||
nt|ntmon: don't understand @DK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: if 5@D showed 3 aces then 5NT was an invitation to grand and @SK should suffice|pg||

nt|malipivo:  We are in middle of the final match.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s7|nt|keylime:  I can understand if red. |pg||
nt|keylime:  but at equal white, makes no sense.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Thanks Johan!|pg||

nt|jlall: i think if your system will routinely get you to game with unremarkable 23 HCP that would not be good|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i actually don't know the difference between 3@c or 3@D by W, but i think 3@c sound stronger|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  That's true of 2@C forces 2@D|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  if*|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  A decent push, considering that 1NT is down on double dummy defense|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|MolvaM: getting critical|pg||
nt|poohbear: BTW I like 2@c over 1NT. It puts partner in a much better position to compete if they enter|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrdct: andy may have done better to play a @s through before cashing out the @d suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: but it's a lot easier looking a 4 hands|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The cards are in the right place here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: With this said, West did not have a raise of 2NT of course|pg||

pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: there was no hurry to play clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Youngsters, Poland vs England, at the moment winning 25-4 VPs.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 10, they didn't cash those fast winners, so contract made and a major swing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks like.|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: an drugim stole nie padla kontra na 2@s...|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The 7 card Major fit played better on board 9 with the void in @D|pg||
nt|jlall: this one should be fun, 7S is pretty good, if east is able to show 4 spades and short diamonds west can basically bid it|pg||
nt|jlall: if not, it will be much harder|pg||
nt|poohbear: hmmmm|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Give me two doubletons and I'll bid 1NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: Not me|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  But not with 3-3-6-1|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would if partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|asya13: Not my style|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|malipivo:  5@d-all pass, so a likely push and a missed opportunity for both teams.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The convention cards are available from:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Documents/docdefault.asp?page=2012YouthChampionships|pg||
nt|minimeck: Now is a time for your slam pavel :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  May I say it? :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 24 hcp 3NT coming it seems|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Australia and Italy are also currently qualifying for the Quarter Finals in the Youngsters category. A good sign for the future prospects of both countries at Junior level, once the current players become too old.|pg||
nt|sliynk: we lost 2 vps for a phone fine and lost some vps for slow play against denmark in the last match|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: she possibly(!) saw @sQ5 @c54:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: but opposite a non passed hand very dangerous|pg||
nt|minimeck: Another slam time here|pg||
nt|minimeck: good pressure 2@s bid :p|pg||
nt|adonis18:  and one that makers:)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  makes|pg||
nt|minimeck: spades 5-1 and hearts 3-1 make it not a claimer, but might make|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is playing 3@dS.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cicus: tough now - S will have to pass and N?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Permission granted|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Mozart's music for my ears.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Slam is on, dear spectators!|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3@h here a popular treatment, showing 3 spades, singleton heart, and 4/5 either way in the minors, GF|pg||
nt|minimeck: the same bid also exists for 3@s (1-3(4/5))|pg||
nt|minimeck: if partner chooses a minor, you can then bid rkc (kickback) if he bids 3nt, then you can simply bid 4nt or in this case 6nt, or bid gerber|pg||
mb|1H|nt|uni_dennis: in open room bd 11 NS were having a misunderstanding in the bidding, as N passed 2@c |pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n from South would be reasonable now.|pg||
nt|cicus: not on a 5 count|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, that's true|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I am too on double dummy.|pg||
nt|cicus: N had an option to bid 2NT right away though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@h opener might let them make 1NT on a @h lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is sort of endplayed at first trick.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Nasty Andy. Semi psych picking off Zanasi's suit|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Now E can bid 4@D|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: is it a problem to open 1NT with singleton in Israel? I would understand American singleton-NTs in WBF events, but not sure about Israelian ones.|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d looks like Multi. Shows an overcall with one major|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  2NT = Lebensohl, relay to 3@C|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@h is on.|pg||
nt|minimeck: starting with x here seems normal|pg||
mb|d|nt|keylime:  N/S got very high here and paid handsomely.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@d is cold here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Now dealer is testing their bidding to 4@s.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: very disciplined|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I am impressed|pg||
nt|jlall: im guessing east shows a light splinter, when he shows that its diamonds west will probably bid 7S|pg||
nt|minimeck: dwyer much less likely to try something strange like that than owen :)|pg||
nt|goon1407: this is true|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may spot 3!n played from West only.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Both minor aces are sitting nicely for declarer.|pg||
nt|minimeck: south might have been tempted to simply blast nt|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S making is fine result in any case|pg||
mb|2H|nt|uni_dennis: but East is to the rescue with DBL|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I thought west could find reasons to bid 3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good spots|pg||
nt|MolvaM: two 8 spots and a 9 :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no deuce|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems to make actually|pg||
nt|poohbear: or 3@ds when you have a stiff @c :P|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: board 2 - singleton Ace 4441 1nt by West|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Now this is really weird|pg||
nt|minimeck: hard to see them getting to slam on a lebensohl auction here|pg||
nt|adonis18:  2nt? scramble, Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|adonis18:  if lebensohl, N has undervalued his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: depends on what you mean by "opportunity" - against 6@d, West would have had the opportunity to lead a low heart and get a club ruff|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: expect them to land to 3NT here will probably bid 2@s now|pg||
nt|cicus: I think he has too many losers to bid this high|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: lubie 3nt:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: DBL very agressive opposite a NV 3rd hand opener|pg||
nt|jlall: 4H probably = short diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: think 2NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  reopening would be nice from North.|pg||
nt|cicus: 5 losers - partner will raise 4@D with 3 tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but better than all other sorts of 10/11 counts with his QJTx in both @s and @C|pg||
nt|minimeck: Here Siderov chooses to show his 5cd minor and continue in a forcing auction|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Indeed, this treatment is working nicely on this deal.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec and yes: 5@h go down on diamond lead.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|keylime:  W/E have an incredibly lucky minor position being 3-3.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2 down probably|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is another battle: down two or three?|pg||
nt|warrens:  in 6@H, @S lead, cash @H Ace, 3 rounds of @C's, trump to hand, ruff another @C, no way back to declarer's hand.  is there a way to make it that's normal?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garden2005: TRUDNE DECYZJE|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: a teraz?|pg||
nt|garden2005: dzieñ dobry wszystkim|pg||

nt|kluk: najgorsze, ze te 4 kiery idzie!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so another pick up for bulgaria|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is only 14-imp difference, it might vanish even in this round!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  North knows she may get endplayed.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Making 6 here looks a tough ask, with spades 5-1 and hearts 3-1, don't see the entries to rough 2 clubs after drawing 1 trump|pg||
nt|minimeck: We shall see, NS have bid it in the other room|pg||
nt|minimeck: A possible chance for israel if they stop here|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And it is not, well done England!|pg||
nt|galallie:  well done EW|pg||
nt|poohbear: Now the question is : knowing that @hs are 6-1 and no entry to hand. Do we finesse the @d?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is playing 3@cE.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: need to find the @C ruff to win the board here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT would be off on a @s lead, but 2NT can be made if declarer gets 4@d tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  two tens are helping|pg||
nt|cicus: even 4@D is a stretch when partner could not act over 3@H|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: a pas chyba jakos tam forsuje...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no to teraz ju¿ mogê siê urlopowaæ |pg||

nt|lukasz1982: :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice lead to start with|pg||
nt|poohbear: Zanasi shows close to a 2NT opener for this sequence so DiFranco has an easy 3NT bid|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Safe lead, but it won't make a difference as long as the Diamonds split reasonably|pg||
nt|jlall: if south had 2 diamonds and Jx of spades, he would need to duck the spade so that he could overruff diamonds later...not relevant here of course|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Nicely found.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer will be forced to play @cA soon.|pg||
nt|minimeck: A million specs giving me lines of play in 6 hearts, I am too tired to contemplate all of that, I will just wait and see :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: oh, I see - 5@d was played by North, and East led a club anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I must admit I am not that disciplined (among other things), but I would respond 1@d as I would like to know more about partner's hand.|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I'm a bit surprised he didn't bid 1S if he was going to semi-psych ... given that it's more preemptive.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hung got his partner off to a good lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 11, they are in 3@dS.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|malipivo:  yes, exactly|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and here comes a spade ruff|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Indeed.  He clearly knows more than I do :p|pg||
nt|poohbear: @s lead works as well|pg||
nt|poohbear: Singapore winning max and now has a comfortable lead over Denmark|pg||
nt|poohbear: for the last spot|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hung will need to know to shift to @cs and not @ss when in with the @h king|pg||
nt|poohbear: so nothing clear at the moment on this hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Would overtaking @dT with @dJ help defense?|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes|pg||
nt|poohbear: because then if declarer ducks Hung can shift to a @s and get a Negative signal|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  The card Nabil plays when declarer takes the H finesse should be suit preference between C and S ...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  She may escape at the moment.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: entry to east is gone now|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: jesli wygra to bedzie strata|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|uni_dennis: bd 11 N playing 2@dX|pg||
nt|poohbear: so then when in with @hs he knows @c only hope|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Oh dear|pg||
nt|minimeck: And here we are, diamond lead certainly best, spade seems totally normal, (as at the other table)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|galallie:  ruff draw trump and claim :)|pg||
nt|asya13: Looks like we do not.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The reason is that she is missing an entry.|pg||
nt|warrens:  do Levy-Asulin play this auction as constructive?  if 2NT showed a weak hand, I'm very surprised that S drove to slam|pg||
nt|ntmon: to play on @C is declarer's only reasonable line, in spite of the lead in this suit|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: zobaczymy jak umiejetnosci:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even if he had a 4card major|pg||
nt|poohbear: no problem :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|keylime:  The overtrick here may matter. |pg||
nt|dburn: so West could find the heroic underlead to beat five|pg||
nt|garden2005: teraz widaæ, ¿e nie jest warto otwieraæ z trzeciej rêki 4@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zanasi could not read the lead probably|pg||
pc|hA|nt|adonis18:  reversed lebensohl?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Hard to say, my instinct tells me they just play it regular lebensohl and south drove, but i certainly could be wrong|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mrdct: making now as it happens|pg||
nt|mrdct: huge board for the aussies|pg||

nt|bebechira: or 1st has some king of choice?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: nr 1 chooses from 5 to 8|pg||
nt|MolvaM: open north hand tez?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Nice job!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But they may lose imps as 6!n is also on.|pg||
nt|minimeck: might lose 2 imps would imagine most pairs will get to 6nt  :p indeed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: board 9 lafont played 3nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and stole a heart trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but he continued hearts instead of ducking a club. and went down|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that was a missed opportunity for france|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Justin couldn't take the bad commentary anymore, and started chiming in =)|pg||
nt|asya13: lol|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mrdct: i need to head off shortly to as it's about a 10 minute walk to the venue which i think will be a pretty happy score-up|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, hearts are tricky for such a contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: kind of choice :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, they were high but not high enought :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: must be the multi|pg||
nt|poohbear: ty :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  They were down in 5@d and 6@d, so it is strange way of calling it an opportunity (to bid slam).|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no overcall from east with 5-5?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  We here are fortunate to have Justin Lall as a commentator. Justin is a top tier US player who just missed the age limit for this|pg||
nt|jlall: 3 months too old, blame my paretns :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: lets see how far Levy Preempts|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The next quarter will start in around 80 minutes|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@d is a good save|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ianmcc: and no values!|pg||

nt|galallie:  i actually reminded justin that he had to ability to comment, he said its always been a dream of his ;P|pg||
nt|galallie:  *:P|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Scoreboard shows only down two, so operator probably lost the play.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is playing 5@cS.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is in 4@s after 2@s-p-4@s-all pass.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe it was an opportunity to display superb judgement by stopping in 5@d by South or 4@d by North|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I see slams everywhere, I am sorry about that.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a low to @hT and spades back|pg||

nt|MolvaM: no|pg||

nt|ntmon: 4@S on a finesse|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: another big result in OR|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@c or 5@d has no play potential, so likely 2!n-pass|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *playing|pg||
nt|malipivo:  or 3@d, we shall see soon enough|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Quite close slam, but it is not there.|pg||
nt|cicus: a speculative double now?|pg||

nt|goon1407: N/S are going to need some help on this one|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Good D0P1 chance here|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  A very rare, but helpful bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: is it?|pg||
nt|minimeck: Special thanks to all of our kibz & our wonderful commentators as well, a birth in the finals and a matchup with poland will await the US, \|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is a slammish hand, but after a closer look there is no slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I am happy when they make and I am also happy wen defense succeed.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  in the meantime, fans of Enya: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZuOQ8nIaOk|pg||

nt|z_lasu: na drugim stole ciekawsza licytacja|pg||
nt|MolvaM: with effectively 10 hcp's|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the multi did its work|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer in 4@h will be in a lot of troubles.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so only a double and a diamond lead needed now|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a diamond to ruff, a heart, a diamond to ruff, ...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Operators are losing those fast plays from time to time.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|malipivo:  And now a battle for overtricks.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5 club is not a very profitable save. goes -500 and might also be 800 if declarer loses control|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ahh yes the shapely hand cannot contain his excitement|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south could have a variety of hands. so north was supposed to pass|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but france is on a roll|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5@h should show 2 kC|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl 0 pass 1|pg||
nt|asya13: with no queen?|pg||
nt|asya13: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: with no Q :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  N-S may consider sacrifice in 5@c.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: bye all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: bye Dave|pg||
nt|dburn: will have to revise my appraisal - East-West can almost make a slam here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this will make, just losing 1@h, 2@c and 1 or 2 trumps|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: won't go wrong in @s |pg||
nt|tez: ''minors''|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I saw 4@h as -3.|pg||
nt|minimeck: When west gets in with the queen of clubs may need to shift to a heart|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It should be one down: two diamonds and @cA.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The results on the scoreboard is usually right.|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|vugraphzjy: i can't redeal the 14th|pg||

nt|ovncylmz: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  sure, after a non-spade lead :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: czy to prawda, ¿e 4@s?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s bid is a testament toHung's "solid " overcalls and his declarer play|pg||
nt|jlall: interesting choice by north to bid 2S, if partner is 5-4 or 5-5 then I would think pass was better hoping for 5-5...but it worked well here as it induced a balance from hollands|pg||
nt|ntmon: i can't imagine the game will not be bid|pg||
mb|4C|nt|malipivo:  I am kidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: they can also make a couple of overtricks in 3NT redoubled, which scores more than a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, that's a missed opportunity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@sX would be -3, I guess|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It cannot be more as we see a fast loser in every suit.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hm, declarer is missing entries, he might go down. :(|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Entries are crucial for repeated finesse in spades.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  All about the spots in this slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: right|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Great bid by the Jengs|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: i like @S9 lead now:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this will go down|pg||
nt|malipivo:  E-W must be careful to cash all those winners first.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  or more likely 4@hX|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so this time a few imps to the Netherlands|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer has to work hard|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can make it if he guesses the stiff trump king|pg||
nt|ntmon: on combined 21 - count|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dburn: not quite clear why South decided to double 3NT - I can understand why he might double 6NT, but below that...|pg||

nt|MolvaM: I predict -2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but still if he takes the club finesse he escapes with -1|pg||

nt|malipivo:  He is the man at our table at that deal.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok no more predictions :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The actual way was probably a heart to ruff and a club towards !K or a low club. It is hard to say.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the hand went between -2 and making and ended up -1 which was what it should be|pg||
nt|poohbear: so how do you penalize them|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: SOUTH didnit see his hands|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see merit in 1@S|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this might make though, if defense plays @S early|pg||
nt|tez: i dont like pass 3rd place|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: dwie siedemnastki w jednej randce rzadko siê zdarzaj¹|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but they don't really have a reason to do so|pg||
nt|tez: good 12 point|pg||
nt|MolvaM: Axxxx is good against a splinter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I would personally go for 4@c or 4@h with 6-4|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: I think he found a really good hand except the number of trumps|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|malipivo:  well, a risk of club lead is obvious|pg||
nt|MolvaM: agree|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@c shows a max raise to 2@h . Drury convention|pg||
nt|poohbear: South broke one of my cardinal rules|pg||
pc|dK|nt|keylime:  One of the specs reports it's 20-12 if the score holds.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Correction 20-12.|pg||
nt|keylime:  20-10|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but getting to East hand for a club ruff is difficult|pg||
nt|malipivo:  some people treat xxxxx as four card suit|pg||
nt|tez: nearly 5@c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We could see a similar situation yesterday, a bidding side is missing AK in one suit.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and bid 4@d with 5-4 hands but thats me|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on the way to a losing slam|pg||
nt|goon1407: Thanks for having me Matt|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tez: part score swing|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would prefer to be in 6@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It would have its chances, leading from Axx or Kxx is no beauty for defense.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In theoretical 6@d, clubs would get a chance to be developed.|pg||
nt|jlall: DT shift feels normal but his club holding might make him hesitant|pg||
nt|goon1407: Thanks for the specs as well|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|z_lasu: miejmy nadzieje ze nie zagra na singlowego za|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie powinna|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: znowu kompyter siê zestarza³?|pg||
nt|jlall: might even play a low diamond, catering to AJxx or something with his partner, so his partner can continue diamonds|pg||
nt|minimeck: There are still a vast number of boards to be played, this match is far from over. |pg||
nt|ovncylmz: partners nowadays never give me AKxxxx suit and @SK and singleton @d with 4@s bid:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Don't make marginal preempts with the Ace of your suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There isn't entries to develop hearts for two club discards.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They play 6@s in the other room. Position of club honors is unfortunate.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cicus: but when you are relatively weak, raising partner is most important|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3@h E-W is making as far as I can see|pg||
nt|jlall: certainly a reasonable play though doesn't look smart when partner has AQJ8|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yeah, the 10 would have been a great surround play here|pg||
nt|galallie:  cant always play double dummy, unless youre justin lall of course|pg||
nt|jlall: lol...if only that were true|pg||
nt|galallie:  :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I mean in other room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Results and running scores for all series:|pg||
pc|s7|nt|uni_dennis: 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: Looks like a very flat board|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, it is|pg||
nt|tez: zanasi why not 1@h?may be pd has 4card @h..|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zanasi worried abt suit quality obviously|pg||
nt|tez: ginuus:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but 1@s was wrong|pg||
nt|poohbear: The chances are very slim that the opps have a slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: when you start with one ace|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|sA|nt|uni_dennis: 2@s on bd 13 was a(nother) push|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: unless ofcourse South decides to get creative and opens with his 11 count|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: van Lankveld did open 1@h, van den Bos now relaying the hand|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: so this could be a possible swing for Netherlands|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Some good declarer play this match.  Australia a certain 3rd in the RR now, and Italy set for 7th.  Just pride to play for in this match now.|pg||
nt|ntmon: it is pleasant for declarer to have all those nice spot cards - @HT, @S8, @D98|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|minimeck: We shall see if the viewgraph continues with this or another match, either is possible|pg||
pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  West didn't get chance declarer to misguess hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  esp. with Txx.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  He is just missing @hT.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|malipivo:  If West would be void in spades, that would be a nice story.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@h was ok but west was impressed with his void and having all keycards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can he still make it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: with single @hQ and @h9 well placed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I dont think sor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I am aware that GIB says the hand is makable|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If he doesn't touch hearts at all, maybe there's a chance.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north double of 5@d was unnecessary by the way|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he was telling himself what to lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *enough|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: back in 50 minutes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|MolvaM: this is a fundamental mistake. might lose a heart fit if existed. but no problem this hand|pg||
nt|tez: they will take @h ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|malipivo:  This is the last board. The semifinals continue in about 30 minutes.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2 imps flowing to Poland for not being doubled.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: S should know 3352 in E now if N showed count in all suits|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ryskiel_: nieodbrze - kombinuje jak koñ pod górkê|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i wyrzuca lewy|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so no need to play on @s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  My homework: is 6@d on a non-heart lead?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Singapore grabs the 8th spot|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|malipivo:  *gave|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|malipivo:  2@h E-W would have its chances.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|uni_dennis: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: in my view, W should have taken the push to 3@H - how is E to know he has 3-card support with a singleton?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jlall: this was the danger of the low diamond play, partner couldnt work it out|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Thank you all and bye for now!|pg||
mc|10|nt|uni_dennis: but he did, so a push|pg||
nt|tez: play @d|pg||

nt|malipivo:  42-imp difference sharp|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So even overtricks play its role.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but critical for singapore (9th) just 1 vp behind denmark|pg||
nt|tez: lucky 6@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: here is a slam on 2 finesses :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It looks it is not as clubs were protected.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We haven't seen a 3!n contract today, that's little strange.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kib tells me tha3@d would have been a splinter too|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  That might be a swing to France.|pg||
nt|poohbear: and Netherlands looks like they will win the RR|pg||
mb|1C|nt|malipivo:  and it would be a lovely grand North-West|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: The stopped in 4NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and another slam hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 25% chance but today it works|pg||
nt|MolvaM: since 2@d would be a reverse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: anyway west chose to bid 4@d here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: east|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=919&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|poohbear: would take them losing a big swing on the last board|pg||
mb|1H|nt|uni_dennis: some dutch pairs play 1m - 4@c to show this E hand|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: wackwitz played it with Drijver last year|pg||
mb|1S|nt|johnjones:  back to another well played push board|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 13 top tricks here in @h, @c and NT|pg||
nt|cicus: it is not clear how NS can come to 11 tricks in spades here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@d = 4+@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@d is?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@c?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: diamond support and invitational?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It seems so, otherwise 2@c is in view.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt makes thanks to 4-3 spades|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Edgtton thinks the West hand is too good for a mini-NT perhaps?  I would have wielded the mini|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|malipivo:  playing @dT has its advantage on this deal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  diamonds could provide discard for that club|pg||
nt|cicus: some of the lightest overcalls I have ever seen|pg||
nt|cicus: oh yes but you have to trump 3 clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  be happy you haven't seen mine|pg||
nt|cicus: I can live with any style|pg||
nt|malipivo:  so hearts must be it|pg||
mb|3C|nt|keylime:  1@h is a xfer to spades here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  natural, or 12-14 / 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but the opps never leave you alone in the bidding at these colours|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@S denying 3@h|pg||
nt|tez: they play 4@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dont expect them to bid though|pg||
nt|malipivo:  (I am sorry, we did, Board 2.)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@c would go down as clubs are 5-1.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@h shld have been more distributional than a 4432|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south has stoppers everywhere but maybe interested in a slam|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  18-19 bal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  slam zone for E-W|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and natural|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3!n looks crazy, but as cards lay it is there.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|MolvaM: 3@s? maybe asks spade stopper|pg||
mb|4H|nt|malipivo:  leading hearts twice from East is possible|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@D GF relay|pg||
mb|5C|nt|malipivo:  East lead a low club in the other room.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it solves our mistery|pg||
nt|tez: easy hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other room is playing 4@hN.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  I'm curious what 2NT is used for here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *mystery, my apologies|pg||
nt|cicus: oh I did not notice :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  that overtrick helped a lot in the other room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  it might be another imp for China|pg||
nt|cicus: even 10 tricks are not obvious here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but we are not done here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: club finesse first and then @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  and now time for defense|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a heart do @hK, heart back and a heart ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@h asking for a @s cue|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: yes EW are doing a good job disturbing NS|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@d and 3@h natural|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2@s has its chances.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|uni_dennis: south should have shown that he has @sA, i think|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the @dA is not with spade length so no problem here|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Over 1@H?|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I mean 2NT instead of 2D over 1H|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but not today|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I would play clubs even it is not best here|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: jestesmy z powrotem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: NS start from 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh|pg||
nt|poohbear: Congratulations to the Netherlands !! they won the Round Robin|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Unbalanced 4-card supp for spades|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4333 hand with great intermediates leans South into the 3NT contract on the 9 card major suit fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With a balanced hand and 4-c support they go through 2@D|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: E showing slam interest now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if he ducks twice|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  From South's view, the hand will be slowly played, hence the lower game contract.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that is careless play|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The spots in clubs is a good news for declarer (@cT9876).|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I am missing @sJ and I am still unaware of spades distribution.|pg||
nt|cicus: ok, 9 with one ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though E could have bid 1@c - 1@d // 1@s - 3@h GF with good suit i believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: nice 2nd half by Zizhuo and Jimmy, to make it a match|pg||

nt|malipivo:  oh yes, that's necessity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  as there is no entry to East hand|pg||
nt|cicus: not now as W can pick up spades for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is a lovely textbook example and if it is not, it should be.|pg||
nt|cicus: so infact there are now many ways to make the contract|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: there is one now @S10|pg||

nt|MolvaM: alhough normal|pg||
nt|malipivo:  spectators for joining us at this table, their wisdom, and we wish the best luck to all the participants in next matches! This is a great experience for them at the international level.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|cicus: @S(= provides a finessing opportunity|pg||
nt|ntmon: the match is still within the reach ob both teams, although Polish girls extended their lead in this segment by 11 IMPs so far|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cicus: @S87|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: 185 a my 200 na te chwile|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: could make if @hKQ were not wasted|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|uni_dennis: EW lead attitude against NT, 2nd from bad suit|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Next round today starts in 1 hour and 30 minutes according to the BBO plan:|pg||
pc|c2|nt|keylime:  Defense if they have listened can work out a club return|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|MolvaM: one diamond duck will bring in 4tricks in that suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: let's see "kasja na wyjscze" |pg||
nt|ntmon: sry, N leads|pg||
nt|ntmon: after normal @C lead, declarer cannot make|pg||
nt|ntmon: provided @C will be returned|pg||
pc|c4|nt|uni_dennis: @D to 10 now, still 1 down |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|tez: no dbl no trouble|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer can figure out what happened in clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We may ruff a winning club to start finessing, but I am not sure it is enough to make this.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|poohbear: Thanks Malipivo|pg||
pc|sK|nt|greenhand: safety  play on  diamond  was  the  best  way  to  make  it|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: a jesli chodzi o 4|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: to tak, 35|pg||
pc|s3|nt|uni_dennis: so 2 potential swing boards to end the session with|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: he will make 6 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: singleton against KQ is terrible|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: ok, thanks all for watching. we will be back in 1 hour with session 6|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: running scores:|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 7@h bid by NL on 15 in the open room|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and padon bids 7@s over it|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and NS bid 7NT, so 11 imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: it was Vulnerable, so 13 imps even|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lukasz1982: A Francja dzieki temu meczowi weszla do 4|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: defense will probably make 2@C, 1@D and 1 in each Major|pg||
nt|MolvaM: will make 2 or 3 overtricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Congratulations to both teams, we have got a great performance! Thank you all and good bye! See you soon!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|uni_dennis: if E really played @D6 on the first round declarer can finesse in @d, but unlikely he will|pg||
pc|c7|nt|keylime:  I want to thank the specs for their help, BBO for the event, and fellow commentators. Signing off for now.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Except for the hand the Jeng's overbid to 3NT, we have watched some pretty good bridge here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  That we have John.|pg||
nt|keylime:  And I think the 3NT was influenced by the club slam.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Yes, although maybe that is a lesson to be learned not to compund your difficulties.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The 6C slam was pretty.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The slam fit their methods well, and the evaluation pivotal.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Some interesting matchups for RR3 coming|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I'm curious how 5D was allowed to make at the other table on this last hand.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Appears that the heart was never allowed to be cashed. Declarer won the trump ace and played a club. Spade return and that's that.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  That would explain it.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Two matches left to finish|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: wiec pewnie jeszcze raz mecz z Francja nas czeka|pg||
nt|ntmon: now too late|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|lukasz1982: w playoffach|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cicus: by retaining @S10 for a reentry, W can take now all tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @h now, maybe W will insert the 10, though he shouldn't|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: @h to the 9 looks unrealistic|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though you can rule out @hQxxx in E. he would have led that|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and a major swing to China|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|malipivo:  Congratulations to both teams, we have got a great performance!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|uni_dennis: already knows E has 4-4 minors, so long @hs in W likely|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but it still makes a trick eventually. the worst is singleton against KJ |pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok thanks all hope to see you tomorrow|pg||
