nt|vugraphzmu: west asking range of michaels|pg||

nt|mackulky: in any case this is hotting up as a contest and usually with Anil on the table not uncommon :)|pg||

nt|djneill:  well, taking a little insurance, but got a bad quote|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok so 1@h was 2-way - @h or balanced, forcing 1@s perhaps, or 1@s was like a NT rebid, denying 5+@s|pg||
nt|nsriram: 1@H might have been relay|pg||
nt|djneill:  either way, East has shown @h-@c, and West likes his tip top double-fit|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|djneill:  3@d by West, in std, is 100% game forcing|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|djneill:  West utilizes a Gazzilli 2NT rebid, showing any very strong 5-5 or 6-4 I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|nsriram: might be playing gadget 2N - game force singke or double suiter or balanced|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@c relay, 3@d shows @d, very strong (to compare, 3@d immediately may be something like 14-16 5-5 good suits - a 2.5 @d rebid)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mackulky: well this seems to be no swinger board ;(|pg||
nt|jaggys: i declarer gets greedy..he can go down...if he plays three rounds of clubs...and defence rufffs and plays 2 trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaggys: loooks routine to draw trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  East, knowing the extreme shape, does not like the @c weakness so goes for 5@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|djneill:  here, NT makes the same tricks as @d so E-W may lose a few imps|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mackulky: but the scores promise it to be stilla cliffhanger|pg||
nt|djneill:  the challenge in 5@d is to avoid losing 2 @d tricks, and so to handle the 4-0 @d breaks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|jaggys: good play to set an alternative tack if they draw trumps you can cash winners..if not you ruff d's|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|djneill:  this is a 4441 dummy, but there are 11 tricks, so bleeding trumps is not a problem|pg||
nt|djneill:  West may have been afraid of a hail mary @c ruff (desperation play)|pg||
nt|djneill:  so chose to play the @dA, forgoing a chance at an overtrick probably|pg||
pc|d5|mc|11|nt|nsriram: they know they have good set. Overtricks not important|pg||
nt|djneill:  against 4441 dummies you tend to just play trumps at every chance, since it rarely loses a trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzmu: W claimed 5 though he was making 6 |pg||
nt|djneill:  but here the @d exit does give up a trick since the @sJ dropped|pg||

nt|jaggys: its a variable nt..15-16 vul and weak non vul 1st 2nd and maybe 4th|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|djneill:  well, South is not so keen on the singleton club, but would love the @cK for partner to have|pg||
mb|p|nt|nsriram: but safe from N side as long as he guesses correct|pg||
nt|djneill:  as it stands now, even a @s lead and misguess would not hurt, since all can follow to the clubs before a trump is even once played, North discarding 2 spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok North may have some imps finally!|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|nsriram: I think Anil and Rajesh would get to this slam|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
mc|12|nt|djneill:  the @hJ is an attempt to stop another hail mary ruff, as perhaps East has the @hA and West a void somewhere - the @hJ makes it look like a finesse guess|pg||
