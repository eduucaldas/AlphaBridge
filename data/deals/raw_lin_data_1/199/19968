pc|c2|nt|psridhar: 4@h can make and is a better game than 4@s -but to sac on the EW hands seems unwise to me at matchpoints|pg||

pc|d3|nt|psridhar: Norths bidding also not very convincing-he could not scrape up a raise to 2@h over 2@C, but leaped to 4@h, later =means he is loaded in @C EW's main suit|pg||
