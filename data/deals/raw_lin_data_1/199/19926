mb|4C|nt|007 joosth: a non dangerous lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: H lead and you have to take care for not getting trump promotion|pg||
nt|gsper:  4@S saved E a headache.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no reason for not taking the ace|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and needed to play the trumps for 1 looser|pg||
nt|007 joosth: another huge overbid  I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they were not listening to you Joost |pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3H is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: well EW can even afford a little error now|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes think it's an invite hand only|pg||
nt|007 joosth: those Jxxx in 2 suits is 2 times bad|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and 8 hcp is not much altogether 4H is e really bad bid|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok the T and 9 of spades are nice  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they sign off in time|pg||
nt|barbyh: with all suits breaking slam is a make|pg||
nt|sybarra: best in clubs of course |pg||

nt|Walddk4: 12 tables in every round|pg||
nt|gsper:  This line is playing with fire. But opps may not believe it.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but S still does not have his d trick  and will not get it easily|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a clun now maybe better   the heart can wait|pg||
nt|007 joosth: club|pg||

nt|vugraphzmk: N got an explanation that E has 1444 or 0445|pg||

mb|2N|nt|007 joosth: you only missed 1 unsafetyplay|pg||

nt|007 joosth: 2H in S ?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 3H when it has a similar meaning|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D multi  with a strong version in it  |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sybarra: oh not bad  |pg||
nt|007 joosth: standard bidding now|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3H might promise 4 trumps|pg||
nt|gsper:  I know people who would have bid 1NT.|pg||
mb|d|nt|barbyh: good dbl gets partner off to the right lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D's transfer  and N doubts they could make it |pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: ok  what ever the quiver gives me|pg||
nt|sybarra: better than most other leads |pg||
nt|barbyh: tr or cue bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: i dont see chances for down|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: espcially with that lead |pg||
nt|007 joosth: E  muist have minors, but still at imps  a diamondlead seems more promising|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: game depends on the spade Q|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3@d close to making|pg||
pc|c9|nt|007 joosth: maybe discarding the loosing club|pg||
nt|sybarra: with opening bid,  might play W for it|pg||
nt|barbyh: anything higher than 4 could have been beaten|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|007 joosth: club switch now|pg||
nt|sybarra: may lead @D and put in dummy|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if you let trump E a heart declarer will manage the trumps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: club is obvious i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: helpful lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|vugraphzmk: called "Muiderberg"..|pg||

nt|sybarra: *minor|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is an option Joost|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but then a slam missed|pg||
nt|007 joosth: so start with the forcing 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzmk: maybe 2NT asking minor??|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe start with 2 nt? |pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||

nt|vugraphzmj: I would pass as North now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 points is a lot to pass but i would too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Close -- if you bid it might be partly on partner's slow 3@d which implied choices|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: but with passed pard,  may not reach too high |pg||
