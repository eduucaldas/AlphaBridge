nt|vugraphzjh: EW  is a pair fom Ahmedabad vinay is a veteran and Sapan a promising youngster |pg||
mb|p|nt|sarkar_suk: hi all hi promod :)|pg||
nt|babs59: so they should all be familiar with each other's games/styles|pg||
nt|psridhar: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: pls check out the scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome Barbara|pg||
nt|psridhar: 'spy vs spy ' |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: and ofcourse welcome Sridhar |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: EW play two systems depending on vulnerability |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Again a Home team where the pairs play together as a team |pg||
nt|patricck: aah, now that makes more sense :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|strike12: 11 tricks to go with for this deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: please check out the scores at http://royale.hpages.com|pg||
nt|strike12: 10 sry|pg||
nt|nkgupt: u mean 9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Need to discuss with your favorite partner whether this double is penalty, responsive (not classic after the weak-2 opener), or just DSI.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: EW play precision modified |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome back sorry |pg||
pc|sK|nt|dslee: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Subhash and Venky need no introduction |pg||
nt|jcwla: Well done by W.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Suhas Vaidya has played for India alreay |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ianmcc: looks like 6 losers|pg||
nt|psridhar: ty|pg||
nt|dslee: can we have the top 6 positions mak?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: pls see the weblink as above |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|dslee: thanks mak|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sunit thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: It is rare that 2C is passed,  2C can be a big hand, just short of a jumpshift or 2NT bid as it was here|pg||
nt|babs59: hi all|pg||
nt|babs59: a newly-formed team, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi Barbara welcome GM|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: pls check scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  with an opening hand and 3@d, 2N is a bit of an underbid but E was able to raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders have changed now it is Jaggy and Dalal|pg||
nt|patricck: The difference of 416 can really be divided by 13 because each score is matched with every one of the other 13 tables, so it is like being about 32 imps behind the leaders|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nkgupt: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hi welcome NK|pg||
nt|dslee: none of these folks except sunit is very spontenous - i wonder why this bid happened|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is headed for 3NT|pg||
nt|patricck: oh yes, sorry typo, already said 9 earlier|pg||
nt|patricck: 20 points each|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: lead of 9 0 or 2 higher cards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ianmcc: looks like -100, with care|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi in long trance |pg||
nt|nkgupt: did not understand seeking pd's opinion and then overrule him :)|pg||
nt|patricck: which I guess is why West doubled, but wasn't he fortunate to find that  both the AK of @S were in the South hand?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: av sud be about 120 to N so 5@sX-1 translates to about -65/70|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dslee: well there you see|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Anal Shah has been two times Commonwealth Teams winner|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good line, I fancy|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|strike12: we have every round updates at the above link, so keep urself posted |pg||
nt|dslee: difficult to crack|pg||
nt|dslee: -1|pg||
nt|animeshraj: becoz 6S . should come with HA.J sort of|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ianmcc: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  how high would they stop? even grand is makeable|pg||
pc|s5|nt|patricck: 2 spades and 2 trump losers unless declarer is a genius|pg||
nt|patricck: 2 spade losers and 2 heart losers on the face of it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzjh: 7 claimed|pg||
nt|animeshraj: gm all.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: After this round will be lunch break and we shall be back at 1345 i.e. after 1 hr 45 minutes |pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT probably would also have been 1 light|pg||
nt|babs59: Sunit bought a very good dummy, tho the 4@C bid would have shown spade support and shortage|pg||
nt|babs59: Ajay is trying to shorten dummy's trumps to make the hearts worthless|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last seven rounds to go . For running scores please visit http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html |pg||
nt|ianmcc: back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi Ian|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ianmcc: 10 should score well continuing clubs pays off|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, this certainly is safe enough|pg||
nt|babs59: the top 3 remain unchanged... yet again|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sfoxa:  but to bid it, E has to imagine exactly such a hand by partner - with long side suit|pg||
nt|peachy: W needs to have control of the auction, E described his in opening and then 3S, I assume|pg||
nt|peachy: This is still makeable if declarer is careful|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: and this tournament is his brain child|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psridhar: Anil will lose 2@h and 4 trumps for d1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi makarand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Makarand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzjh: hello again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT was possible, not 5@c|pg||
nt|nkgupt: one of the flatest i suppose 4@h-1 all round?|pg||
nt|patricck: can be hard to guess the average on a board like this|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: or has X-ray eyes :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|babs59: placed currently 4th and 22nd|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lucky 3 @d with Wet|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|cJ|nt|psridhar: RV in lead still?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: probably 12 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|babs59: but only 9 ahead of Ashok Goel trio|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a matter of overtricks only|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|strike12: if S can steal a @c trick he could had made 11 |pg||
pc|cT|nt|psridhar: looong way to go|pg||
pc|d2|nt|strike12: too late nw|pg||
nt|babs59: I must admit to being somewhat unfamiliar with Invititational Pairs where threesomes play!|pg||
nt|psridhar: now even d2 ? kind of dummy reversal defense with long trump taking two ruffs?|pg||
nt|babs59: seems that way now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: venky in a trance|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: the J@H led from hand would have lost only one trump trick, but it only works on this layout and gives up on West holding Q10xx|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but secures the contract|pg||
nt|ianmcc: of courde only 1 @h|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice exit|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pc|hJ|nt|sga1: 1@d showed 4+@hs and 1@s promised 5@cs and 4@s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|d5|pc|hT|pc|c6|pg||

pc|hK|nt|vugraphzjh: for the benefit of the viewers Subhash Gupta has played for two countries the BB Canada and India |pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: yes sorry i misclicked|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: discussion about if 3nt shud have been passed |pg||
nt|nkgupt: std people will not come to know there 6/6 fit so early to block all the way|pg||
nt|jcwla: A warm welcome to Andy Vinock.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone...hi Jordan|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi andy welcome|pg||
nt|jcwla: Could be a bonanza of cross-IMPs there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggy and Rajesh need no introduction in the international circuit having played for India several times|pg||
nt|ianmcc: well bid should be +4IMPs or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: close to 6@c here|pg||
nt|babs59: PS, how come you aren't playing here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: my partner is not free|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: both Venky and Sreedharan also have played for INdia the BB|pg||
nt|peachy: Venky also an international level player|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome |pg||
nt|patricck: I am told the difference is 330 imps, as the website is a round behind, so Gupta and Venky are effectively about 25 imps behind the leaders|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thats why i announced the scores after 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this vul they play 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: no results put up as yet|pg||
nt|animeshraj: 3NT is a good spot for NS.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: Oops, sorry mak, you already said it|pg||
nt|sga1: The Positions are     1    1197   Subhash Gupta - K R Venkatraman ,  2     1168   Raju Tolani - Ajay Khare   |pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely in 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: EW play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will get a dbl in but will be hard pressed to come back into auction after that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: now NS play Std 2/1 in this Vul|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ianmcc: maybe 3@s N/S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: E/W have nothing|pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT-2@D-2@H (unlikely 2NT good fit max hand)|pg||
nt|animeshraj: I THINK 1nt-2d-2h-3h-3nt...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S look to be OK in 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 is 1556   2 is 1259 |pg||
nt|patricck: P P P 1@S, and then stop in 3@S I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: yes|pg||
nt|sga1: 3 1142 Jaggy Shivdasani - Rajesh Dalal ,|pg||
nt|sga1: 4 898 V M Lal - Raju Bhiwandkar|pg||
nt|sga1: 5  832  Ashok Goel - Sudhir - Suhas Vaidya|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS 2/1|pg||
nt|babs59: a very light 3S bid by Sunit|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, maybe NT or just pass|pg||
nt|jcwla: The truly amazing part about this segment is that it started on time.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A little birdie told me you had better not make close doubles of E.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  with Aces and Kings, 1@h might have been a better choice|pg||
nt|jcwla: Certainly not playing the part of an overly busy bidder.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S may play spades, likely 140 again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S in 3NT have only 8?|pg||
nt|patricck: but 10 tricks are actually there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: nothing much will make|pg||
nt|patricck: just hard to get there|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ianmcc: So the lower N/S stop the better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS aren't strong enough to reach the game but EW may push them|pg||
nt|peachy: 3S might be a pre-blocking bid|pg||
nt|animeshraj: ah! there u go.|pg||
nt|patricck: should just reach a club partscore here|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: the page is still to be updated|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I am informed of a change in the lunch times and next round will start at13 30 i.e after 1 hr 30 minutes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: but trump leads break it|pg||
nt|nkgupt: X=4M+longer m|pg||
nt|dslee: trick is to lead @H|pg||
nt|dslee: lets opps struggle to get the tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sandwich NT not in favor among the upper echelon.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Vinay has played for India for Zonal trials and Sapan for INdia Juniors|pg||
mb|3N|nt|strike12: 3@d will be the right spot to play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Germ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hi all |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, looks like preempt, but N will be surprised with result|pg||
nt|sga1: Scores are available till last round on this website :  http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@d expensive|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 1@c-1@s-2@c-4@s-5@c now N wud hav had his word in @s and free to X now|pg||
nt|patricck: 3NT by West probably would have made, but difficult to bid|pg||
nt|nkgupt: kb surely not passing 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he is dep in thought|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: deep|pg||
nt|nkgupt: he hasnt come all the way from home to pass:)|pg||

nt|jcwla: Good lead.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: surely 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3NT alway OK, overtricks if @d not led|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to reach a slam on 5-2 |pg||
nt|strike12: do we have the current results after round 8 Mak?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has to X|pg||
nt|patricck: NS can do quite well in hearts but not so easy to come into the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: losing 1 in each suit. average|pg||
nt|babs59: this is one of those hands where the transfer doesn't exactly improve the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: please check out the running scores at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||

nt|panja: hi Makarand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: a Doctor in Chemical Engineering|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi Prakash|pg||
nt|patricck: well, Mazumdar did well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: open room did well|pg||
nt|animeshraj: well bid N-S|pg||
nt|dslee: good lead anil|pg||
nt|panja: the question is, can he make 12 tricks...|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Prakash, glad to see you volunteering your expertise for the kibs|pg||
nt|panja: 11 should be easy..but with @DK off..12 will be difficult...|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d switch now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Ashok Goel has been a former National Champion|pg||
nt|patricck: nice controls A A and K, but jumping to game opposite a passed partner?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Positions before the last round are|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: and hello Srini|pg||
nt|strike12: Hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm, I don't like that on such a ragged suit, AJ10xxx maybe|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe there are some inferences from the 3@D?  Seemingly an immediate 3NT by E would have drawn a @D lead.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT is a perfectly reasonable place, can't anticipate duplication in @s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: and to our operator, Makarand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks folks ;) I am doing the netcast first time so pls execuse for any mistakes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes it is|pg||
nt|nkgupt: quite a position to take to defend 1ntX when pd did not open even 3rd seat|pg||
nt|nkgupt: other table bidding brd 2 on almost anticipated line for std ew:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: brd|pg||
nt|patricck: probably 0 or 2 higher lead. That is going to help declarer more than the defence|pg||
nt|nkgupt: brd1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: a litill better in fact...pin pointing def to 5@c w/ 3@h bid on the way|pg||
nt|nkgupt: little|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi Welcome to Pune Third and Final Day of RN Bagla Royale Pairs . Last Eight Rounds to go today . The leaders are |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi Rajesh 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Subhash Gupta Venky 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Raju Tolani Ajay Khare 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Anal in deep thought|pg||
pc|h9|nt|babs59: 2 defensive tricks...  that's all to this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4@h should make|pg||
nt|ianmcc: makes double-dummy|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|strike12: The @s position is favourably placed, so dec has good chances for scoring it|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Andy|pg||
nt|patricck: why not lead partners suit when you have Jx?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|strike12: np Mak u r doing great|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzjh: claimed :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: wise|pg||
nt|panja: hi Raija, thx|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: faster|pg||
nt|ianmcc: reprieve|pg||
nt|andyv:  that play made little sense|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|strike12: N has got the tempo now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psridhar: Sunit can smoke out the trump ace now |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: live scores can be seen at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|ianmcc: will make 90|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  E will get his 4 tricks and that seems to be it|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, 2@C is Drury, but still a big result for NS here, perhaps they are trying to make something happening in the last rounds|pg||
nt|kemperg: no problem for leader|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|psridhar: in the air|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may anticipate difficulties with rebid after 1@h opening, but this time both 1NT and @h partscore -  no play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not much worse in NT |pg||
nt|andyv:  true as to play of hand...and 1N usually fine with a 5 card major...here, however, the major is top heavy and the outside points are in Aces...those cards belong in a suit contract.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: maybe not a @d|pg||
nt|patricck: that is the end of the defence|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzjh: claims 7|pg||
nt|babs59: Sunit is considering 4-1 spade breaks and the overtrick|pg||
nt|babs59: now there is no problem|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzjh: the running scores can be seen on the link http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|psridhar: he then has 8 ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I can't think releasing @hA was good but no hope|pg||
pc|d9|nt|strike12: @s 10 vital card|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a correct guess in diamonds probably brings 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting position appears after 6 @h tricks, let's see|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: interesting position for Vinay |pg||
pc|dK|nt|psridhar: looks like that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: about 15 kibitzers around the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Rajesh dep in thought|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzjh: all smiling on the table |pg||
nt|babs59: yes - I had the hearts inverted in my mind (defensive hearts)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: deep|pg||
nt|patricck: oops|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that there are two entries to dummy to play a spade|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  costly switch by S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: unless that induces some discarding problems|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|psridhar: that misguess however spells doom|pg||
nt|patricck: now the heart loser goes on the spades|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  or so may be the case - playing W not to have last spade |pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer is taking a line that will allow making.  Ordinarily 5-3 fit in trump contract is preferred, but with enough for game+, NT often better|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W was concerned about the entry problem, should have ducked the 9@s|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
mc|9|nt|strike12: This will be home soon|pg||
nt|sga1: Really expensive sacrifice by Kiran|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: both pairs playing some variations of precision|pg||
nt|psridhar: JM wasnt tested in other room|pg||
nt|peachy: E might have played the last spade when he was in with a diamond|pg||

nt|peachy: 6-3|pg||
nt|panja: y, N hand is worth way about 21 HCP|pg||

nt|ianmcc: sif they lead 4th besst South should play @hQ at trick1|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: I think that will be some imps in there for making 3NT, much harder on a heart lead|pg||
nt|patricck: both sides can make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: For running scores please visit http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sandip is multiple Ruia Gold Cup winner |pg||
nt|babs59: this hand fits really well but even so 6@H would rely on an endplay in clubs.. which works|pg||
nt|jcwla: Very nicely done by NS.|pg||
nt|andyv:  something happened...in end position didn't N haave to lead a @d or did I miss something|pg||
nt|babs59: sure - but his DJ was high and then his partner's D7 won trick 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: no he was left with all winners|pg||
nt|babs59: a nice little defensive beer card|pg||
nt|jcwla: S did that at T8.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: where do they find these deals?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 1@c looks OK......|pg||
nt|patricck: I am told NS are 22nd out of 28, maybe that explains the wild leap as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: leaders S Gupta Venky 1917|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Second Jaggy Dalal at 1790|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Third Raju Tolani Ajay Khare at 1579|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Sunit 's first seat preempts are not bonded by Llyods of London :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 4@H will need careful handling|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: after this round will be a snacks break and the next match would start at IST 1745 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: alerted|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good stuff where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: @h6 is a powerful card after j7 drops|pg||
nt|babs59: however, it relies on South having no wastage in the diamond suit...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Fourth Sunil Macchar Arun Bapat at 1349|pg||
mb|1S|nt|strike12: a big pickup for NS as they gain in terms of Total Imps|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N made good decision - knowing partner has good @h fit, N sees 6 tricks in the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: NS play a variation of precision|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, so declarer gets 2 hearts 2 clubs 3 diamonds and a spade before EW get 3 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|patricck: hard to know about the first board, but that was definitely a few imps for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: another trouble hand, but not big trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N balanced in passout seat over 1N, E dbld and W played in 2@d, making|pg||
nt|patricck: 1@C Precision|pg||
mb|2S|nt|strike12: W might just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: that puts Arun in a fix|pg||
nt|ianmcc: noone told Anil Padhy|pg||
nt|peachy: Was fortunate they had the agreement to show max with good supp|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, ok, that is what i missed...ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Fifth Sandip Thakral Kaustaubh Bendre at 870|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Isn't this pairs?|pg||
nt|panja: 25 HCP..this should be a routine game..10 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this foursome have played for INdia so many times|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome back |pg||
nt|sga1: 1@C - 17+, dbl 5-7 HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: NS can have two heart tricks, I believe a heart lead from east is awkward too|pg||
nt|ianmcc: South has 9 tricks but East has 11|pg||
nt|ianmcc: better than 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: it is IMP pairs |pg||
nt|strike12: 6@s is on if bid|pg||
nt|peachy: I am not familiar with NS system, sorry|pg||
nt|peachy: Standard, with transfers over 1C opening, I was told|pg||
nt|peachy: If anyone interested to see what K & R hand evaluator says about it, here http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@hX -1 or -2 looks about right|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 1@H is a transfer style response|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: 1NT isn't to everyones taste on the South cards, but it can be a very effective tactic|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzjh: The Pair of A Goel and Suhas Vaidya will be playing for Indian in this BB|pg||
nt|babs59: 2NT is likely 20-21 (and many 19s :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: This will be costly for EW|pg||
nt|strike12: Very Costly now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: OK tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: total 28 contestanting pairs |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all play all each pair plays 6 boards against each other barometer|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Modified Precision|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N opens with the end-contract possible, but both sides here have to tell something|pg||
nt|babs59: 3@C is Smolen|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would anyone have passed 1@H with the E hand?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|strike12: is N still thinking for a Save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could go down 4|pg||
nt|panja: if W gets to underlead the @CA sometime..it could get interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should duck this|pg||
nt|patricck: takeout double from Soth?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: and pass from North|pg||
nt|babs59: now Anil has shown 4 spades, 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: and Sunit's 4@H bid confirms 3 hearts but a minimum 2NT, else he would cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but success!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|andyv:  I mean N|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sixth VM Lal Bhiwandkar at 769|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi thinking about lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Anil knows it alright-but his 5@d was calculated to test Arun -he knows he has long @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: we will do without those snacks but pl provide us coffee :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: that is abut 45 minutes from now |pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you kibs and Mak|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 27 natural def beats 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: no X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes was a pause |pg||
nt|ianmcc: how do we get a score so fast?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: this score is only a comparison of the two vugraph tables|pg||
nt|psridhar: +300|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ianmcc: bad bad|pg||
nt|babs59: that's one double too many for Sapan|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Vinay explaining his doubles |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: ruff now and dia back, can make east nervous, but wont help the defence|pg||
nt|kemperg: good fight for part score|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzjh: the game is tooo fast to make all explanations of alerted bids here|pg||
nt|peachy: It is no problem, Mak.  Let me quote somebody: Operator is like a long tailed cat in a small room of rocking chairs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|babs59: hi Ian.  Kiran had to find the lead of a small Diamond|pg||
nt|nkgupt: but is a good save:)|pg||
nt|patricck: it is true eats woud have to pitch a heart if declarer started with two rounds of clubs vs 3NT on a heart lead, but what declarer would cash 2 club tricks at the start of that ...|pg||
nt|patricck: hand?|pg||
nt|patricck: ah yes I said both sides make 11 tricks, but I was wrong, the @D ruff holds spades to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: South was planning on bidding spades twice before bidding @H|pg||
nt|patricck: the transfer response means South is playing this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 H was transfer positive response|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that pull to 2@s never crossed my mind i must admit|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: could have been lucrative, but it went so quickly it seemed North wasn't even slightly interested in defending|pg||
nt|babs59: with the 2-2 hearts it is viable to ruff out the diamonds and find the magical club position for the endplay on West|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzjh: ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|patricck: @D and @C don't behave, but the magic @S position should be enough to see declarer home I think|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: after a long thought|pg||
nt|andyv:  first dbl is ok...2nd dbl puts too much pressure on partnership|pg||
nt|jcwla: W really tempting fate here.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  the best way - try to reach the table with @s|pg||
nt|sga1: seems like 4 losers 2@d, 1@h and 1@c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: about 20hcp each ...odd breaks vul opps only 7@s per say cant see a logic for the pull|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|peachy: Club lead, or club now, will give declarer plenty trouble making|pg||
nt|andyv:  on @c leads this hand is going down like a rock|pg||
nt|patricck: 3@D and 2 tricks in every other suit = 9. But declarer doesn't know he can get 2 spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: wrong guess|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now the roof falls in|pg||
nt|psridhar: plenty of tricks , can make for sure |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  got this experience few times (fortunately) commentator's job looks better :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|patricck: maybe he does now, or at least suspects it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he might make if he doesn't touch hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: of course Subhash could make but only if he flies the DK immediately|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: the black suits were lying quite well for declarer and he still wouldn't have been close to making 2@H|pg||
nt|nkgupt: and dont expect dummy to turn up w/ good @hs (afterall just 4/5 hcp there at most) do well placed 5@h's|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nkgupt: so well...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: on board  31 North's preference for @h was excellent|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes sorry my fault|pg||
nt|psridhar: np|pg||
nt|psridhar: tough job|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think 5@s quite wrong|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm sure Subhash would have expected a trump lead from Venky on the auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: cant be |pg||
nt|psridhar: @d king for @h pitch|pg||
nt|jcwla: W bid the same hand twice, that's the problem.  Had a perfect original X.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 off, 2@S was contract|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  in mp, you have to be...but in teams, best contract wins most of the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claim|pg||
nt|patricck: After the duck if Declarer had foolishly played a 2nd trump then a 3rd trump would have trapped him in dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: Sunit will also need to cash his @CA early enough |pg||
pc|cA|nt|babs59: if he has to lead clubs from his hand, West will be able to unblock on the @CA|pg||
nt|babs59: however, their trump spots are good enough|pg||
nt|andyv:  now hand has some play|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@D wasn't alerted, but if it is showing @D and @H then declarer has a good idea about the hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West will be endplayed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggi sees it ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: in a trance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  troubles are over now |pg||
nt|panja: @D9, what else now?|pg||
nt|patricck: must be red suits of course because East bid 2@H|pg||
pc|cT|nt|peachy: Kib says Raju not yet awake :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Raju =  E|pg||
nt|panja: and a Club after that...from W....|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ianmcc: will be -200 - could have done better|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is easy to be careless on such hands|pg||
nt|patricck: maybe they recently conceded -670 in another match, you would have thought at least it was worth considering the pass|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some play for what?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|babs59: would I fly the DK?  I doubt it - but I would wonder why they'd led dummy's suit (such a lead is usually a singleton)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claims 10|pg||
nt|babs59: it is possible he might try for a squeeze given the @DA lead, instead|pg||
mc|8|nt|peachy: South decided to try sqz|pg||
nt|ianmcc: if so you are dead anyway|pg||
nt|babs59: however, everyone at this table knows each other's game and style very well, so it might depend on that|pg||
nt|nkgupt: was a 99.99999% pass for me|pg||
nt|patricck: not sure of the exact percentage for me, but something close to that :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: should be an easy 3 NT due to favourable locations of @SJ and @CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Score is correct |pg||
nt|andyv:  probably|pg||
nt|babs59: @CAK could not have been left in dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: it was trick 6 for those who want to check - Subhash did not trump his partner's winner|pg||
nt|andyv:  N could have pitched 2@s but, as Jordon mentioned, E should work out the @c suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: trouble in open room I'd like to play 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: can NS find 3N here?|pg||
nt|peachy: The heart switch was not bad, E expects W to have something, due to N limited opening|pg||
nt|peachy: South is a She, sorry all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: np my fault of entering names :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: East should have bid 4@h fast|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: After round 15 the leaders are |pg||
nt|jcwla: Aggressive @S game does not come home on this layout.|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice deal:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|babs59: that was a bundle of IMPs for Raju and Ajay who are lying 3rd|pg||
nt|babs59: if Sunit had made 6@H it would have been very expensive for their 3rd position|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  tough call for S|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h could go for 800|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S seems too strong to preempt, even after passed partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: after this round will be the lunch break and next match will start at 1400 Hrs IST i.e about an hr from now|pg||
nt|babs59: Kiran and Satya play transfer responses to 1C, so this shows spades|pg||
nt|patricck: another board with not many imps at stake|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice little hand, majors for E/W, NT for South|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: this one interesting Little for anyone|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opponents are guessing and the 5-level too expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: but She has played for India in BB several times|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: in the open catagory |pg||
nt|peachy: Hearts play remarkably well|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: subhash writing explanation|pg||
nt|babs59: despite the big fit, there are lot of losers for NS.  EW can only make 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|babs59: I think we are heading to 4SX again?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: pls visit http://royale.hpage.com for running scores |pg||
nt|babs59: it might go 1H  1S  2D  P?|pg||
nt|babs59: or  1H  1S  2NT  |pg||
nt|babs59: if the latter, then 3NT will be reached|pg||
nt|psridhar: subh's decn now|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2@d will go all pass|pg||
nt|panja: this must be @H and @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Venky explaing to Sreedhar subhasgh 2S|pg||
nt|peachy: 4D could fit jump apparently, promising nice diamonds _ heart fit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: counting carefully I see 5@c should fail|pg||
nt|kemperg: NS a @C system I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: Kokish relay on 2@c going on here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@c was an underbid, lucky|pg||
nt|ianmcc: perhaps they will reach 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Jaggi  + Dalal|pg||
nt|patricck: will NS bid their game now they have been given a 2nd chance?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: it was not alerted on the table|pg||
pc|h3|nt|strike12: undo pls|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - he's more likely to downgrade than upgrade that hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  playing small @h E expectes exactly the @hK, Ace could have been better, as for me|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks to make|pg||
nt|patricck: or will they take a huge penalty from the balancing 1NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  hut off!|pg||
nt|andyv:  normal 4@h contract although 3N may play better because of the @h split|pg||
nt|ianmcc: double dummy maybe beatable|pg||
pc|hK|nt|babs59: and 2D could be on a 3532 hand shape too|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N played by Subhash may be in trouble on @s lead|pg||
nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.com/ website with info and results after Round 9|pg||
nt|babs59: that North hand is remarkably similar to Kiran's hand last board!|pg||
nt|patricck: this will be difficult to make on a @H lead|pg||
nt|babs59: with the @H position you can make 11 tricks EW in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: can they find the grand slam ?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ianmcc: certainly not 5@d|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner's strength is unknown and the decn to bid 5@s is making an unwarranted assumption tht they can make and we shd save|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@d better|pg||
nt|babs59: 2D by Subhash won't pose any difficulties tho|pg||
nt|panja: this will be difficult..|pg||
nt|patricck: @C offside and @S onside, with one pitch forom the diamonds there should be 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: North has a beautiful hand in this auction, the auction made it even beter than it initially is|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *hat|pg||
nt|panja: unless @D are brought in....it will not make...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Ashok thinking |pg||
nt|patricck: provided declarer guesses @H|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you prefer a low @C lead or @CJ lead here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 3 depending on agreement|pg||
nt|patricck: well, 2@D is "only" 500|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzjh: sorry i misclicked too many alerts |pg||
nt|animeshraj: well done by ajay.|pg||
nt|patricck: there we go|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzjh: yes was alerted from both sides |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: her regular partner has been the same as now |pg||
nt|babs59: except on a club lead|pg||
nt|babs59: even on a club lead!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: sry for misclick|pg||
nt|strike12: i like the bid from W, any comments?|pg||
nt|andyv:  N should dbl this|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd like to have at least the 8 (J 10 8 x x) to lead a @c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: Excellent record for her|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2 S Gupta Venky|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 VM Lal Bhiwandkar|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4 Raju Tolani Ajay Khare|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@d was multi|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Suhas thinking|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@s likes @h, pass or correct|pg||
nt|sga1: 2NT = 24-25 HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: 2 clubs 4 dimaonds, 4 spades and 1 hearts for a quick 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ianmcc: maybe only 100|pg||
nt|patricck: I have sympathy with Wests desire to balance, but it was dangerous with such soft queens and the unprotected K@H under the opener|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sga1: 3@c = Puppet Stayman, 3@D = one major|pg||
nt|sga1: 4@C now Natural slammish with 4@Hs|pg||
nt|babs59: on a club lead, you cash the @DA and then use 4 rounds of hearts to discard the 3rd club|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think after 1@s North is worth another move|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|peachy: Playing Precision, N might not be sure of South's diamond length though|pg||
nt|peachy: \|pg||
nt|peachy: Even then, might run short a trick|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  bloody rain|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panja: hi Pramod, all|pg||
nt|panja: 7@D better than 7Nt here..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Hi this is Makarand ;)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N could be hardly blamed for this opening lead|pg||
nt|sga1: Heading towards 6NT|pg||
nt|sga1: He will bid 5NT, choose lsam or can be 6NT|pg||
nt|ianmcc: far-sightedcover, means West will be endplayed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: on correct defense yes they can beat it by 1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: not enough entries |pg||
nt|sga1: slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: now seems to be doomed after H lead |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: or, rather, 7@S..|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will not be pretty|pg||
nt|sga1: 4@S cue, he has assumed @D as cue in support of @Cs|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Jeetu in a trance|pg||
nt|patricck: praying for a singleton Q@C, things wer ethat desperate|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nkgupt: n    |pg||
nt|panja: and the play will go...remove trumps, ruff a Club...cash last trump discarding Dummy @S, and then @HAK..black suit squeeze if @S don't break|pg||
nt|twcho: 7@d is probably the best contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  was it @sK indeed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can only imagine S's desperation|pg||
pc|d5|nt|patricck: were that|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|twcho: with squeeze possibility|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm not sure about Anil's double - where were his defensive tricks?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm still looking to understand why K might have worked/under what circumstances|pg||
nt|peachy: Good play, tring to make and if the 8 didnt work, didnt matter because it was going down anyway without it|pg||
nt|babs59: the club at trick 2 was a tidy play, despite the CA offside|pg||
nt|sga1: 1-4 key card assuming @C as suit|pg||
nt|nkgupt: odd hand ...ns hav cold 9 tricks in @s's|pg||
nt|nkgupt: for a good save DD|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sga1: Ashok finally makes the bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: suhas explaining the auction to Rajeev|pg||
nt|patricck: at least West didn't lead the K@C, that would have been 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: well done |pg||
pc|h4|nt|babs59: when I double there, even the @DA is over my king|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panja: of course @S are 32...so there are easy 13 tricks..|pg||
nt|panja: @HA...then @DA..and @DQ|pg||
nt|babs59: I guess he trusted Sunit's 4C bid rather than the opponents' bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  no play now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: google says Scott, but apol accepted|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzjh: claims 11|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|andyv:  still has to lose 1@c and 4@d|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|nkgupt: did not even try for @dkj stiff|pg||
nt|panja: now..this might go two down...@C ruff too early wasn't all that useful|pg||
nt|nkgupt: ?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psridhar: did he do that?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|nt|ianmcc: well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya concedes last |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2H was both majors |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: so the play more double dummy |pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: No entries to do it AND return to dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: marked most of the outside values with West...  but East's diamond return was kind|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: claims|pg||
pc|c2|nt|babs59: shuld be contract I believe Mackarand|pg||
nt|babs59: (sorry I keep mis-spelling between Makarand and Mackulky)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes corrected |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: both are ok Barbara :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: i realised the VU graph operator is much tougher than playing :)|pg||
nt|babs59: I've been told to call you Makya :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: also accepted|pg||
pc|h8|nt|peachy: Still prob will, though, N and S in no trouble following suit or discarding|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya claimiing|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H missed, E had no bid for a 2 suiter?|pg||
mc|11|nt|psridhar: ok he survives pitching a @S now|pg||
nt|psridhar: other tbl sniffed game thru the right route but chickened out at critical stage|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: the scoring is Total IMPS |pg||
nt|ianmcc: the perennial question to open or not 11 bal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: well played for -300. not a great result|pg||
nt|psridhar: win trump in dummy, @s ace and ruff, @h exit..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 20 minutes to the next round KNadar + B Satya Vs Anil Padhye + Sunit choksey|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: S and E in discussion about the last board|pg||
nt|peachy: Results after Round 9 (last round). Will be updated soon to include this round|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes |pg||
nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html  Results after Round 10.  Will be updated after this round 11 is finished|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: intermediate|pg||
nt|nkgupt: strong weak knowing his style :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: sorry the score for last board is -1|pg||
nt|andyv:  16 imps almost impossible to recover in a short match|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: two more boards for the match |pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam for N/S may be hard to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: next match is leaders Subhash Gupta and Venky Vs KIran and Satya |pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: Jaggy has finished his set and passing bye the home game ;)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: even after the first @h play this hand could still be made...@d to hand and a @s towards dummy and eventually endplay S with the 3rd trump...as per junaid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last two boards for the day . |pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure there is some discussion about whether South should have ducked the A@C :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Thank you all for being with us and we look forward to be with us tomorrow for the last six rounds|pg||
nt|jcwla: That was undoubtedly -2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes corrected sorry |pg||
nt|jcwla: And 3@D on that cheese got its just deserts.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: some will be in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: by|pg||
nt|patricck: bidding is slightly wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: sorry for last seven rounds |pg||
nt|andyv:  good catch|pg||
mb|1C|nt|strike12: yes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: North/south better silent here|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS dont have values for 3N|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think @d9 promotes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W probably about 95% responsible for that disaster|pg||
nt|sga1: As per latest running scores, Raju Tolani and Ajay Khare have overtaken Subhash - Venky|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, thats better, pass then 1C, 1s|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: to open S or not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html is the exact webpage for running scores |pg||
nt|ianmcc: slam for E/W but not in clubs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: X looks brave - will he pass 5@d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Satya in a trance|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: they just informed me they change the system with vulnerabiity and this is precision modified|pg||
nt|peachy: East hand is much too good for any sort of premptive action, 1S is normal|pg||
nt|ianmcc: where are the present pairs running?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: all scores may be seen at http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@d shows hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tomorrow the tourney starts at 9 AM IST |pg||
nt|ianmcc: another misfit|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ianmcc: Precision might help E/W keep low|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand for competition...NS make at most 8 tricks in any contract...but have 23 HCP...they will feel like trying for a game..let us see|pg||
nt|babs59: I have help :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks like best game|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: we will play 22 later as North Tabled 23 before |pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: Transfers in Intervention - a good tool|pg||
nt|sga1: Now slam chances with aggressive bidding by S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: too hard for the elderly|pg||
nt|babs59: pick a slam?|pg||
nt|babs59: you do a great job as VG op - I esp like it when you pass on the tension and the atmosphere|pg||
nt|babs59: wow - I never trust Subhash with the boards!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: reaching 4@s good work|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: EW play precision modified|pg||
nt|patricck: Hard to see that this set is working out very well for Jaggi and Dalal who are currently 2nd|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panja: is this Match Points or IMPS?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd suggest 2@s bid by W|pg||
nt|patricck: N/S can make 3 of a major amd EW can make 4 of a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I thank on behalf of the Sponsers and Organisers BBO and BFI for allowing this transmission|pg||
nt|ianmcc: every E/W contract terrible|pg||
nt|ianmcc: as we see|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: To all Kibs, since being a Pairs Tournament, there are no comparisions shown as results will be posted at finish of all tables. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: good decision|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats my formula for balancing when they havent found a fit = " dont"|pg||
nt|panja: good pass by Rajesh..|pg||
nt|panja: are they playing prec?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 3N is making double dummy|pg||
nt|panja: easier in Precision...|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C might be transfer, in competition|pg||
nt|peachy: transfer to 2D, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was alerted by Satya |pg||
nt|sga1: Now 5@c cue should take them to slam|pg||
nt|patricck: Sorry, table collapsed there for a moment.... presume players are just picking the cards up off the floor and reorganising :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|strike12: 4@c might be FIT showing with @d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@h close but diamonds nasty|pg||
nt|psridhar: are we going to witness a lightner X of 6@H here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Venky is fearless balancer otherwise|pg||
nt|peachy: Since they play transfer over 1C opening, I boldly assumed they also play transfer in compe tition, a method that is steadily gaining popularity|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board?  yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  low level bid and acceptable doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: one more after this |pg||
nt|babs59: now 6D by Satya, and 6H by Kiran|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks that gets more enjoyable watching on the net to get a feel of the table :)|pg||
nt|patricck: It isn't a disastrous set, but with NS bidding 3 games that some will miss they are sure to be losing ground|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: IMPS Total|pg||
nt|sga1: 1@H showing 4+ @s, 1NT - denies 3@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass by N my choice|pg||
mb|2N|nt|peachy: 6 boards per rd, Total IMPs scoring (Pairs)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D will go one down for sure...two likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: trying to correct the score of last deal|pg||
nt|panja: W is taking a huge gamble with that double, holding five of his HCP in @H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: opportunity lost|pg||
nt|sga1: you never know, S may carry on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very good sequence|pg||
nt|patricck: Any other vulnerability it would have been Ok to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|patricck: Thank you for operating the Vu Graph :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: The slam looks easy on any lead |pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H EW failed by 2 so 12 to B there.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just short of being doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3NT might have made here|pg||
nt|twcho: east will be thrown in in @s and give a @d to south at the end|pg||
nt|panja: of course..this is not a good contract..2@H is better...but most likely in @H they would have gone too far...|pg||
nt|panja: ah..the lead solves one big problem for the Declarer|pg||
nt|peachy: He is following the pronciple that the person short in their fit suit must be aggressive, but I'm sure he too wishes his 5HCP in hearts were in another suit :)|pg||
nt|peachy: *principle|pg||
nt|jcwla: The wonderful @S leads continue by Jaggy.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Ashok in deep thought|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well if the deep thought leads to 3NT-2 like it did last time at least it will be a gain for EW.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: South had a problem on lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: GIB might show this as one down...but will likely be -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  only  point of interest on this hand is if N can guess the @hs|pg||
nt|patricck: and now they have missed a thin game themselves|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: all bids were alerted |pg||
nt|psridhar: possibly without the lightner it is easier to beat slam|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that would help make it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S would have shown a small profit for NS -500 instead of -620|pg||
nt|patricck: North will eliminate the spades and diamonds and then run the J@C for an endplay, but as one of the club honours is onside the endplay will have been unnecessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: welcome :) and I thank you all commentetors for bearing with my errors and undos :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Presumably W would want another @C and/or more strength to raise the @C here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E opened 2@h in that room|pg||
nt|babs59: however this is an IMP Pairs tournament|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: The heat of the tournament can be felt in the air |pg||
nt|andyv:  I prefer 3@c to 2@s but final contract is fine|pg||
nt|babs59: each result is cross-IMPed with the other 13 tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Although the playing arena is Air conditioned|pg||
nt|babs59: I understand that a while ago, Subhash was sort of Sapan's mentor|pg||
nt|patricck: would have been tricky to make if the @H were 4-2 as lonfg as the trumps were still 3-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: and board 1 reflects that policy too|pg||
nt|patricck: ??|pg||
nt|patricck: not making 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: corrected :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: was 11|pg||
nt|patricck: ty|pg||
nt|ianmcc: return @h 8 trix|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: As we see the choice of opening bid in Satyas seat made the swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 1NT gets him into @h|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec and I don't like 1NT 5422|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont know anything about systems of both pairs.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psridhar: rt|pg||
nt|andyv:  W must like to live dangerously....leaving the dbl in is not to be recommended to the faint of heart|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA, @dA, @d ruff, @h finesse, @d ruff|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ianmcc: it will be North who carries on|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: quick work by Anand to claim after cross ruffing and finally playing a spade to K|pg||
nt|babs59: So that would add to the tension - Sapan wanting to prove something to Subhash |pg||
pc|s9|nt|panja: if East is smart enough to bring in Clubs to discard a loser...it will be -1...|pg||
nt|panja: but he does not know @C are 33...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but East has multiple problems|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psridhar: a@c lead shd do|pg||
nt|ianmcc: in reality I'd say hopeless|pg||
nt|babs59: I thought Anil might win the HK (H10 being 0/2 higher honours) to lead a club towards the CJ97xx|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: any other lead makes -at least dbl dummy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: testing lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: i mean any lead other than @c lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sga1: S after very aggressive bidding didn't cur his singleton @c the most imp information for N|pg||
nt|sga1: cue|pg||
nt|andyv:  very little to the play of the hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sga1: I wud say Lucky for Satya-Kiran|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Raju Ajay in discussion about the board how to get to 6 after 4H open|pg||
nt|peachy: He has club losers no matter what, might as well try it as he does|pg||
pc|dT|nt|strike12: this line of play wont work i think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ianmcc: low @c safe|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianmcc: looks like 130, not great|pg||
nt|andyv:  only a question of N getting squeezed and/or endplayed in the black suits|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ianmcc: recipe for minus|pg||
nt|patricck: Well there is a similarity to board 14 where North bid an agressive game because of holding only Aces and Kings. Jaggi might well have gone 4@S here on the same reasons, but it is ...|pg||
nt|patricck: a close decision|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: Declarer has no trouble taking ten tricks when club ace is sitting in front of the K and there is no guess involved, |pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: in practise the @d lead shook up declarer ok u win Arun|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: N asking the range of NT overcall|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  and hand is over|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: Anil cannot make it if that lead was stiff, so could have tried finessing may be|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they can cross-trump now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: All considerations would have pointed to bringing the @C's in - inc shorter @H in N|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c7|nt|andyv:  the counting begins for the location of the Q@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: now in a trance|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably should have led the A@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, Q@d|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last board for the set . next round after 15 will the last for the tournament . Thanks all |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|strike12: h sry i wrote wont, was typing would|pg||
nt|ianmcc: at last|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  and the gamble paid off|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Who are you going to believe, honey, me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|sga1: -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|sga1: that is the score entered in Bridgemate|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: i am trying to correct it |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: have difficulties in correctng|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's OK I think we can handle that.  Last board of the round, thanks Makarand and all kibs.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psridhar: both E and W here are fans of Anil -used to seeing him make an OT all the time ( Raju even calls it the " usual anil OT" ) |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzjh: claimed -1|pg||
nt|babs59: hi PS|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last deal|pg||
nt|babs59: no overtricks this hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: they need to be in diff frame of mind defending Vs him|pg||
nt|babs59: he's happy with his haul of 7 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kemperg: but good decision of N, will make this easy|pg||
mc|10|nt|nkgupt: -1 :)|pg||

nt|ianmcc: big one for N/S|pg||
nt|babs59: Subhash and Venky were leading last I saw - so that'll help their cause|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: before this round they had slipped to third|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last board for the set |pg||
nt|nkgupt: surely S sud compete 3@h after X|pg||

nt|babs59: and this hand looks extremely flat|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes :) and now he comments actually i can make more :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: In India Anil as declarer means an OT usually :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last deal of the round |pg||
nt|babs59: he and Subhash together would have been overtrick masters?|pg||
nt|psridhar: absolutely ! u r right|pg||

nt|vugraphzjh: I on behalf of The organisers , Sponsers thank all spectators , Commentetors , the BBO and thw BFI for all their cooperation|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  normal 3N hand for EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  over 2@c, S may bid 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: This round shiuld help Subhash and Venky to improve their score|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would you, Andy?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s may be hard if you play restricted choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: tx Mak|pg||
nt|panja: NS with only 16 HCP are close to10 @S ticks..|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: board 34 was 4@H -2|pg||

nt|nkgupt: fnj|pg||
nt|andyv:  at this vul, yes|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT better|pg||
nt|kemperg: No Brasilian commentators in both rooms?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ianmcc: Most would open at West. 3@s for E/W|pg||
nt|peachy: 1H = limites to about 15. Mod Precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last deal of the set |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 1NT - kind of 1-round-forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand of this round is up. Results after Round 11 here http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html, update will show shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: positions before this round|pg||
nt|sga1: must be trf to @ds|pg||
nt|sga1: 2NT here is @cs|pg||
nt|patricck: EW realistically make 5@D although 6@D can make double dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: and no reaction by kibs:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: the lead will decide the result of 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: North gets to be declarer in club contract, |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Daxin in trance |pg||
nt|peachy: http://royale.hpage.co.in/overall_42590645.html - running scores after round 10, updates will be posted there shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: will be S Gupta Venky Vs Sreedharan Daxindas|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 15 more minutes last board of the set|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 75 hcp pack :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Exclusion RKCB in @ds|pg||
nt|jcwla: If nothing else can always run to one of E's majors :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjh: sandeep in a trance|pg||
nt|babs59: Venky has a great hand opposite Majors|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is Drury...@H fit...|pg||
nt|panja: gives a chance to North to have some say|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes min 4card as announced|pg||
nt|twcho: north could double|pg||
nt|ianmcc: some X|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: pity the splinters are the same suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sunit has gr8 support for @d too -but 500 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: so Rajesh after exlaation took his bid back |pg||
nt|twcho: yes, he doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the leaders before this round are |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should N bid better minor this time? I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: S Gupta Venky are current leaders|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should S introduce 6th- heart or 3-cards @s support - a problem indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: Aah, we get to watch the leaders next round|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|panja: NS can make 12 tricks here...with @S 32..and @C finesse in|pg||
nt|sga1: Satya showing one @s honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Jaggy Dalal 1313|pg||
nt|sga1: 6@c - Zero|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: again explanations been written down|pg||
nt|patricck: a moderate slam which can make with the @CQx onside|pg||
nt|patricck: one of  Bob Hamman's Bols Tips was always concentrate extra hanrd on the first board of a set and the last board|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panja: it is not a good slam to bid...with @D values, most of them, wasted|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: sorry for the scoring error on board 34 I am not able to correct it .Kindly bear|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: an easy looking game, but with both red suits breaking badly it isn't so easy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ianmcc: too many|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the results have been posted on the Results link on webpage http://royale.hpage.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: at the bottom of the page there is a hyperlink to results |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing ordinary 1NTF, North's rebid is 2C|pg||
nt|ianmcc: XX?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 8 card fit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzjh: inquiry from declerer about the lead |pg||
nt|strike12: 10 tricks now |pg||
nt|peachy: Playing support doubles, the decision is pretty easy = Dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  N good enough to bid 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2Raju Tolani Ajay Khare 1186|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 Subhash Gupta Venky 1036|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was a chance|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c lead now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Ajay thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the rare exception when it could only be 2-card suit, normally longer minor or 2C with 3-3 minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a bid by S!|pg||
nt|peachy: South's bid is much too frisky, given their methods, but he is probably attempting to get something back from the unfortunate -930.  I dont like that strategy though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder what was the reason|pg||
nt|peachy: But that is an "if" because I dont know if they have Support Dbl on card|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and with @c shortness the choice could be dbl|pg||
nt|panja: similarly, @H values in N hand are wasted...|pg||
nt|patricck: Partner didn't double 6@C so South shouldn't be tempted to lay down the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: crowd gathering around the table|pg||
nt|nkgupt: MrSG must be baffled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he is sitting with crossed hands deep in thought|pg||
nt|nkgupt: i suppose a save in 6@h coming:)|pg||
nt|patricck: 8@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: the usual Jackson relay many play in INdia|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very good decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: also on the other table|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nkgupt: dont think 4@s can be beaten|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and to win it - an easy deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tx all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: transfer?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: he shrugs and passes |pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think that's high standard|pg||
pc|c9|nt|babs59: thanks Makulky - seems the top 3 just keep shifting around :)|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@H  sorry typo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, this is a lesson hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Vinay thinking on lead|pg||
nt|patricck: should lose just 2 trumps and the K@D tho|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzjh: yes :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3 level toxic|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4 VM lal Bhiwandkar 980|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: last deal of the match |pg||
nt|patricck: mind you declarer can go wrong in trumps, small to the K@C works when the @CAx on side and also @CAxx, bit not against @CAQx so finessing against the queen is better by a few ...|pg||
nt|patricck: percent|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: nothing much exciting in the set :(|pg||
nt|babs59: Precision auction here - EW play Precision (4c M) when NV, Standard when vul|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: North over the top|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 1 Subhash Gupta + Venky |pg||
nt|nkgupt: fit jump/nfj/or trf to 3@d but surely a ilmsv bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: @DQ coming back?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @h suit splitting, W has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ianmcc: but not impossible - well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 2 Ashok Goel Sudhir Aggrawal Suhas Vaidya|pg||
nt|babs59: the 4S/5H hand went badly for Raju and Ajay (currently 2nd place) at the other table|pg||
nt|ianmcc: when is restart? I need dinner|pg||
nt|babs59: they over-reached to 5S, -1|pg||
nt|ianmcc: on  15|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 5 Ashok Goel  Suhas Vaidya Siudhir Aggarwal 681|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: Note that E in OR rebid 3NT, which is fine.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT also is fine, typical of E here, but the idea is you can't have both super conservative invitations and a super conservative accepting style.|pg||
nt|jcwla: You have to either invite conservatively and accept liberally OR invite liberally and accept conservatively.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I don't play Drury can't see need - bid what's in front of you|pg||
nt|ianmcc: and don't indicate the lead|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @h lead well read as top of nothing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzjh: director called |pg||
nt|psridhar: NS will win a couple of IMPs in the wash here|pg||
nt|panja: S knows North's shape now...but he does not know where the honours are..|pg||
nt|patricck: Last board of this set, but more excitement to come shortly|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzjh: so this match shud pull them back up |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: see u after 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: I regret the errors in broadcasting |pg||
nt|patricck: but any more than 10 tricks declarer will need to drop the K@D without any clues|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|strike12: but N might get fished by the lead and try something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 3 R Venkatesh A Srinivasan|pg||
nt|peachy: At least whenever I tried that , I just get more minus.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 round of @h let declarer with no chance|pg||
nt|nkgupt: to much values to miss the slam!!:)|pg||
nt|peachy: South has good controls everywhere so he is going for it|pg||
nt|panja: N could have @CK instead of @HQJ..and the bidding would have been the same|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Director hurrying up |pg||
nt|patricck: A very poor slam, would need 3-2 spades and the A@S onside and the K@D onside, so makes only about 17% of the time|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ianmcc: this needs care|pg||
nt|twcho: how about trump lead and @d shift?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzjh: about the explanation of the meaning of 2S now all ok|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 'slam' effect from last deal perhaps|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good auction for partnership|pg||
nt|peachy: This would have been a working sacrifice, had either N or S been void in clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzjh: claims 12|pg||
nt|patricck: true, a fairly quiet affair, there were a lot of good ones in the previosu set though, and they are probably saving the best ones for the last set :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: we shall be back after 15 :)|pg||
nt|patricck: OK, see you soon|pg||
nt|andyv:  good shift|pg||
nt|jcwla: Of those 2, the better is the former: invite conservatively and accept liberally.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: This set has been bad for Jaggy and Rajesh and may cost them the second position|pg||
nt|patricck: If hearts are 3-3 you don't need the @D finesse. That improves it slightly, but still in the low 20's|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: 4 Jaggy Rajesh |pg||
nt|peachy: Surely was not bid to make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh!|pg||
nt|peachy: This is not a great slam, however|pg||
nt|panja: A guessed slam.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: Sreedhar making inquiries|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Mak and Sveta|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty specs for joining us|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: tx all for joining in and look forward to see u after 45 minutes .Tx Andy and TX Sveta |pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: quick claim made|pg||
nt|patricck: running the 9@C and then the 8@C plays clubs for one loser, but I don't think declarer will seriously consider it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all see u in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|babs59: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: bye for now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: tricky now needs trumps 2-2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzjh: Subhsh in deep thought|pg||
nt|panja: N could also play on @H finessed...then ruff two Hearts....that will work too|pg||
nt|nkgupt: a priori about 42/45/5 i wud say|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 42/45%|pg||
nt|peachy: There is also the spade loser to worry about, he does not know QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|nkgupt: in fact less|pg||
nt|panja: 41 @S break would be too difficult to handle...so I guess he will work on the assumption of 32 @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: bye all |pg||
nt|jcwla: This way you avoid the death contracts (2NT, 3M etc) as much as possible and are safe on the rare occasions you do play them.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A game invitation should be accepted -- ESPECIALLY given E's super solid style - on anything other than a dead minimum.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Playing with this partner I would consider 3NT automatic and expect to make in comfort most of the time.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|strike12: doesnt matter now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: incautious duck|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all we shall be back after lunch after 45 minutes |pg||
nt|jcwla: The W hand is a VERY nice hand, this hand proves both partners cannot be super conservative, it doesn't work, you lose 7 or 10 at a time.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: look forward to see u after 45 minutes for the closing stages of the tournament .|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks again all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: we have four more rounds to go|pg||
nt|patricck: My apologies for not providing the commentary. This session started an hour earlier than the two previous days and I didn't check :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: no problems Patrick please we need u for the last set to start in 15 minutes .Expected many swings in the positions |pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar: assuming Padhey will guess @c|pg||
nt|nkgupt: duck and set up @d for @c discard ...2@c entries there fr the purpose|pg||
nt|nkgupt: these leeds r to well known to SG i suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: thanks all and see u soon in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|patricck: that was probably a fairly flat board across the field|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: not as i heard as some did not get to 3nt|pg||
nt|patricck: Thz for doing some commentary Makarand|pg||
