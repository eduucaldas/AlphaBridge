nt|athene: south certainly can't avoid getting endplayed in the red suits|pg||
nt|psyck: dec will not touch @d on this bidding & S can be endplayed in @h|pg||

nt|athene: i can't believe she is thinking this long? - cash heart must be right, declarer can't have four hearts for the 1nt bid|pg||
nt|athene: cash heart, cash @DK if you want to see for sure, then just exit club, wait for @DKJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: i suppose you might consider 3@D as you are in the pre-balancing seat, but you think partner has four spades, so maybe there is not so much reason|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Auken did not play the king unless the queen was played from dummy|pg||

pc|hT|nt|psyck: only reason for it one can think of anyway|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

nt|eleni: another swing|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west should have doubled 4@C in the other room but it's not really obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: for a start it's not obvious exactly what it means :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|granguru:  well if you were short of opps suit the first time it is hard to have lenght the next round of the same hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: east balances this with a gentle 2@H, and now Sabine can double for takeout, maybe|pg||
nt|eleni: we have all met Spyros Maglaras, our usual operator:) well time to see him in bridge action too:)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: i wouldn't want to pass 2@H with the south hand - it's just too likely it gets passed out, which will almost always be bad|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, Martens is right there|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: there is a danger east might get endplayed in hearts/clubs|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: one of those situations that a new partnership are going to have trouble with|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW are near 6@H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: yes, balancing 2@H is just such a good idea at MP that even when you have a misunderstanding it's not so bad|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni didn't cash his @DA because he wanted west to win a diamond and play a heart|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru:  now W will be endplayed |pg||
pc|d2|pc|c3|nt|granguru:  so any number of down cant be so bad|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|boyklas: @h twra|pg||
nt|boyklas: ston J|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru:  started with the most critical suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: as well as "double is always takeout" it's good to play "2nt is never natural" :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: it wasn't strictly necessary as the cards lie - east could, for example, give a ruff-and-discard when in with the @SK, and it wouldn't cost - but this is sensible defence anyway|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|boyklas: ouch ;/|pg||
pc|h2|nt|granguru:  best is to let @CK alone|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|granguru:  great mistake by Delle cave now|pg||
nt|granguru:  he should have thought this situation long before|pg||
nt|blewah: test|pg||

nt|blewah: hi John, Eleni|pg||
nt|granguru:  hand is made  ow|pg||

nt|kerasidis: claim time|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|granguru:  I said almost 6...only 5 because N overuffs the @S |pg||
pc|c6|nt|eleni: the moment of truth :)|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might run this, in which case east gets the ruff too|pg||
nt|warrens:  west could never fool declarer.  if he never pitches a spade, declarer cashes out.  if he does pitch one, he gets endplayed or the club drops|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|eleni: good decision by Nick|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: looking at it from EW's point of view, this is why you simply can't let people get away with non-vul sacrifices undoubled|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: if you can make anything, you never get enough in 50s|pg||

pc|h2|nt|athene: interesting - many would not use a support double there, as 1@S promises five|pg||
nt|granguru:  use them as lebensohl or mouse or rubensohl or some adjunct or whatever...|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe NS play it doesn't, or maybe they think it's still useful to differentiate between 3- and 4-card support |pg||
nt|psyck: some play 1@s as 4+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 1@S only shows 4+ for that pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We don't know their agreement|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: wrong couple sat on the table so the board will be canceled?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: let's start and see|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|granguru:  pity for declarer that @S8 is not in his hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  another @S will establish the @SJ if taken, but also potencially promoting a @s for the defense |pg||
nt|granguru:  up to now we can count 2@c 2@S 2@d 2@h|pg||
nt|blewah: hmm made now after that @s?|pg||
nt|loe48: can make if do wrong|pg||
nt|blewah: small @c back is not easy to find|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|boyklas: +4 afu ta spathia k ta @d einai 3-3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|granguru:  ducking imporuves a little declarer position as the suit became freezed now |pg||
nt|mathat: now x@h to K and x @H|pg||
nt|athene: declarer lacks the entries to bring in spades, but he doesn't know whether they are 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: that is one advantage for the defence of ducking the second spade|pg||
nt|athene: if they won the ace and shifted, declarer could keep the spades in reserve|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer knows @s position perfectly well|pg||
nt|athene: but now, if he wants to take advantage of a 3-3 break he has to risk setting up another trick for the defence|pg||
nt|granguru:  because W threw @S7 instead of the @S6|pg||
nt|granguru:  fantoni couldnt know W @s cards when he started playing 9 and 10|pg||
nt|mathat: ansd cave 2@s first|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's true|pg||
nt|granguru:  fantoni plays usually SLAVINSKY leads and udca in middle game|pg||
nt|athene: @S7 was a better card then|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: sorry @S6 was better|pg||
nt|athene: because fantoni would be able to drop the big ones if he had the 7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru:  anyhow these are honest players..so the very long thought on taking or not with the @SA gives declarer a picture of what is happening|pg||
nt|athene: east can't afford a red card, but declarer is short of entries to use a long club of course|pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru:  Fulvio is having trouble keeping stoppers in 3 suits|pg||
nt|blewah: there goes 1 @s winner|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|mathat: hi andy|pg||
nt|athene: let's say east exits a club|pg||
nt|athene: and west does NOT unblock|pg||
nt|granguru:  @c looks best because you see stiff @CA|pg||
nt|granguru:  but is it really?|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can cash @HAK and throw west in with a spade|pg||
nt|granguru:  a complex position|pg||
nt|athene: west cashes @SA, @Ck but then must lead into the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: now|pg||
nt|granguru:  as you see Fulvio is taking his time|pg||
nt|athene: if west DOES unblock the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: instead declarer can throw east in with the club!|pg||

nt|andyv:  nice play by W|pg||

nt|athene: IF you read the cards|pg||
nt|athene: sorry @HK first|pg||
nt|andyv:  easy for us to see here...much tougher at table|pg||
nt|granguru:  a good play ..W doesnt want to be triple squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: well, declarer knows the black suit layout doesn't he|pg||
nt|granguru:  he transfered the @c responsability to his partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok, as specs are pointing out, east can't lead a diamond of course either|pg||
nt|athene: so you don't need to cash the @DAK to strip his cards there|pg||

nt|psyck: low to T is % in @d|pg||
nt|athene: finesse the @D10 is best for 5 tricks and best for max expectation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The world is divided. Does 2@S show extra values or not|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: 42% according to suitplay.exe|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|psyck: entries to be considered though|pg||
nt|athene: you don't know spades are 3-3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c3|nt|athene: (or @S10 coming down) so must be better to play diamonds from the top|pg||

nt|mathat: in other room|pg||
nt|granguru:  need some guesses..mainly in trump suit|pg||

nt|athene: so unless it's hugely the best odds play, no finesse!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blewah: Fantoni could have doubled 3@h. This 4@h has some stretch inside I think|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
