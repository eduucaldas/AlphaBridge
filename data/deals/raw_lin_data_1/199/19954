nt|peachy: Lively looking hand to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hi Gary & Aria.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: are not NS the 2/1 pair|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, no shrinking violets here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so NS play multi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  A fourtunate game here with East having two heart discard and the Q@S dropping|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwibridge: Hi Shirley nice to see you, welcome all|pg||
nt|panosk: hi shirley|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and Panos|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx :) |pg||
nt|panosk: hi Gary|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: This must be a very light 3rd seat 1@D by S?|pg||
nt|jcwla: If this auction is to make any sense?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or do we just have it all wrong?|pg||
nt|rv: South will double this, could be phantom save though|pg||
nt|andyv:  do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@Sis a two-suiter, known as Muiderberg in the Netherlands|pg||

nt|panosk: double is support i guess meaning 3hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with all bidding, a good stop, looks like just a make|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4333 in E not very appealing |pg||
nt|panosk: redouble probably honor in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes bet so panos|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi kibitzers and operator :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although a heart lead would have beaten it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi Raija welcome|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Gary|pg||
nt|rv: Muiderberg: 5M+4+m less than opening hand|pg||
nt|zhoufly: ·¨¹ú¶ÔÕóºÉÀ¼|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this should make|pg||
nt|psyck:  This is generally played as invitational' sequence|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will not accept any invitation|pg||
nt|athene: playing a strong club you don't need the 2NT rebid to show strong balanced|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as the cards r 6@d on after isolating @c's a sq of @s and @c|pg||
nt|athene: so, many pairs use it for a 3@D jump rebid with three-card spade support|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N not quite as good as the excellent 6@D|pg||
mb|4N|nt|panosk: yes gd stop indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both pairs play 5-card majors, 2/1 responses are not GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  generally as 5+ card @s any inv hand, some also play it as 4+card @s inv hand|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: yes Tom|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: There are no words for my view on this 1@D opening.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Andy, no sleep:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: but 1 off|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Germ...how was breakfast?|pg||
nt|kemperg: fine ty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|psyck:  If W had a hand to accept inv, I assume E's plan was to say correct 3N to 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck:  Spec an listen to the voice commentary if using the browser version|pg||
nt|psyck:  *specs can...|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this event is an 8 teams comptition after round 1 France with 25 vp is leading Sweden23 end netherlands 22  then come the 2 chinese teams england usa and canada|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think you can make 6@D on ace and a heart lead? aren't you short of an entry to ruff two clubs?|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|nt|rv: not me with especially with @SQJX|pg||
nt|twcho: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|psridhar: the idea behind opening thaat E hand was the shape, but Larsson chickened out |pg||
mb|p|nt|ssbux: it is also common in this part of the world, but usually 55|pg||
nt|jcwla: Something about rather trying to take 3 tricks than 11.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or even 4.|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes too much defensive value|pg||
nt|rv: I will take my medicine (even if fixed) and choose to quietly defend 4@s|pg||
nt|chnjcc:  åä½å¥½|pg||
nt|jcwla: This opening is so cheesy, really deserved a worse fate but the pressure bid pays off this time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: re hi, slight connection error apparently|pg||
nt|rv: North might struggle to make even 9 tricks in @s strain|pg||
nt|chnjcc:  æ¬¢è¿åä½è§çåè¿æ¯å½éå¥³å­ç²¾è±èµ|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have a convention card for EW in my collection of Venice Cup 2011 cards but i assume they play precision, as that seems to be standard in China|pg||
nt|nkgupt: then a positional double sq with well placed @s lenth i think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: nice convention this 2 Nt  rebid   does any one knows the name of this convention ?|pg||
nt|cmule: +1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: So joanna neve sit south and Danielle gaviard North|pg||
nt|peachy: heart lead is by NO MEANS obvious or even necessarily a good choice|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Fiona needs to drive out the A@C and get to dummy with a heart and lead up to the J@D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|twcho: After 1st round, France is the leading team with 25 VP|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: yes|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: standings can  be reached on bbo  programm of vu graph|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nkgupt: the @h4 wud be trick 12:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N a passed hand so likely a pass by S and it is.|pg||

nt|athene: i don't think the 2NT bid has a name|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panosk: 2 Aces missing so 5 is enough|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even that is not necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kathrine is married to Swedish star Peter Bertheau|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "2NT is never to play" could be a good name for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder why she pulled 6 @D?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: OTOH, west reasonably was trying to avoid a ruff in a side suit, but the exact @H split prevents that . . . |pg||

mb|2D|nt|peachy: Welcome back everybody. Here is the link to the tournament website with list of teams, running score/results and other info|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||
nt|sybarra: chinese commentary in closed room  english here|pg||
nt|psridhar: in general +180 on 20-20 deal should not be bad...|pg||
nt|othered1: west probably thought south had both the extra @S and the @HA for her 4@S bash.|pg||
nt|cmule: ¿ªÊÒ·ÀÊØ7NTÊ×¹¦D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: We have different definitions of "just barely there."|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even on a heart lead South has to win the first club and play another one|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi kezhang|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  2+|pg||
nt|athene: NS play what is pretty much "expert standard" these days:- strong notrump, 5-card majors, short club|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  E may just bid game here|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D seem plausible here|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: shaky hand   South have the points  East the distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and S will have hard time ignoring the 6 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h or 4@s will make|pg||
nt|twcho: I believe EW is playing 5 card M with 1C including all bal hand outside NT range|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Henry, alway happy to have you join us|pg||
nt|peachy: Even if W had much less than she does, it is valuable interference after they open 1D, to overcall 2C.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it would be the Swedish equivalent to Gazzilli, named Häxan (the witch)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in 4@h, you don't have to worry as much about the Q@s.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=VeniceCup&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards%2F2011Veldhoven   for ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: convention cards|pg||
nt|rv: West will drive to game here, first bid 2@c as good raise in @h and then maybe bid and rebid @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/Netherlands/dekkers-michielson.pdf|pg||
nt|peachy: Many pairs, even experienced or experts, have trouble in the auction after that start|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although some may have doubled i prefer 2@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have bid 3@d as W, or started with double|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming 3@d means "bid 3N with a stopper, otherwise do something intelligent"|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a nice spot for EW.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: they played 4 @H's making in closed room |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H= spade rasie |pg||
nt|sybarra: also takes 2 @H bid away from W |pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
nt|jcwla: This pace is glacial.|pg||
nt|andyv:  watch out Jordan...they're moving faster and faster|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, but then come the undos -- no new bids, just an alert.|pg||
nt|rv: important system aspect for partnerships to discuss? 3@c could potentially show both majors with longer OM (@s here)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E trying to slow the train down|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think EW in CR are going to have a chat about this auction.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has a 3 loser hand...they should reach game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should 2@S not be forcing on the auction in the closed room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it is not, you have to bid 4@H over 1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Only on this planet, Roland, not on several others.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 2@C followed by something|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kemperg: wise to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...500-800 certainly possible in 5@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was -3 in the CR so still gains 3 imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd have a hard time bidding with the E hand on that aucition in the CR...only 100% force to cue bid and then bid @s|pg||
nt|athene: you can use redouble to show a strong hand but after 1@C it's practically impossible to get the opponents for a worthwhile penalty, as they have the whole of the 1-level to choose ...|pg||
nt|athene: from|pg||
nt|othered1: but does allow the double, which some partnerships make into a meaningful  action|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kerasidis: hi all!|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi pano!|pg||
nt|loe48: Hi Dennis welcome :)|pg||
nt|panosk: even 7 @D is makeable as card lie but i doubt they will get there|pg||
nt|psridhar: N was close to a take out X in terms of shape but light on values and RED|pg||
nt|jcwla: And opp a passed pd - nothing to protect.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||
nt|andyv:  E here decides to show the @c stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W decides to dive off the deep end|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the best spot  is reached by West|pg||
nt|psyck:  With a hand unable to show @d's later, I'd prefer to open 1@d & rebid @c|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if Dekkers had to bid in front of partner with semibal hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: last set was 44-39 heaps of imps traded|pg||
nt|jcwla: To quote "Miracle Mile," What's the hurry, Harry?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will make with no problem losing 4 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be a little difficult to handle the spade break |pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs will be difficult to handle also |pg||
nt|sybarra: lot to do in the hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bep Vriend did not make the 6 nt in the CR|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: K&R has that last S hand at a generous 8.6: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ83+Q2+873+Q973 |pg||
nt|panosk: now secured , the friendly lie that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is the difference between 6@H now and 6@H over1?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: will likely duck on sp  |pg||
nt|sybarra: *duck one |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: she wanted to show a weak opening|pg||
nt|rv: after Marion's redouble|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: I am not surprosed, it looked like a 7 count at first glance|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT seems like the field resting spot here.|pg||
nt|peachy: *surprised|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi aria|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she might as well have bid 6@H directly|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps less likely to make now?|pg||
nt|ssbux: why 3C, either 2c or 4c will be better and not misleading as notrump probe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can play her cards at random here and emerge with ten tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  this looks more scientific, Roland...esp. when her partner showed her useful values in the @c suit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: but I agree that it is usually unbalanced|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer to play 1@s by Dekkers to show more distribution like say 5@c+4@s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|athene: the only chance for 11 is to lead a small heart from hand (you are almost certain the ace is wrong) and hope west ducks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: hello patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Jean-Paul and Tommy|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a decent save non-vul here as 4@H easy|pg||
nt|athene: sorry you are almost certain the KING is wrong|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcwla: I am guessing that W took 3NT to show the high end of a 1@H-response in values.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panosk: redouble showing 1st round control in @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: operator are rooms connecting |pg||
nt|twcho: hi Shirley and Raija|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: at these colours asking for too much. pass the right decision.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice auction|pg||
nt|kerasidis: very usufull....|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately game not reached CR|pg||
nt|panosk: gd lead to try to defeat, spade is no use since auction revealed singleton opposite A|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: South might still have considered balancing 1@H -pd may bid some NT and wont be disappointed with the dummy-but when a fit exists.....|pg||
nt|othered1: there are 9 top tricks and plays for a 10th in @C or a @D ruff, if you can get that before EW find 4 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panosk: even possible void (3@S)|pg||
nt|ssbux: Hi Patrick, will be seeing you playing next week|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: oh  yes, in a similar event with Men's teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Tommy welcome |pg||

pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  nothing left but the @h gess and N may even lead that|pg||
nt|andyv:  guess|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: i don't trust anyone that much, NV vs V with a passed partner|pg||
nt|athene: there are only 13 hcp missing but 10-hcp doubles are not unheard-of|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome John |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|panosk: E showed 3 spades i think with mud|pg||
nt|blewah: S treats his hand minimum|pg||
nt|blewah: so 15-17NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi aria|pg||
nt|blewah: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: elimination play needed, which would be good play to avoid @S guess.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and rashed:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Andy.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ian and I are here also Andy, quite a party|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: impossible to play a low @h  and be down with 5 @d and K of @h  in East|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, John|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi all|pg||

nt|sybarra: you may want to ask operator in chinese,  if rooms are connected |pg||

mb|1H|nt|panosk: N doubled 5@H so defence was easy in 6@S in closed room|pg||

nt|twcho: This tournament is the one that offers the highest prize money for Women bridge players ever|pg||
nt|psridhar: as cards are however, NS havent lost anything |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A nice third-seat weak 2 if available.|pg||

nt|sybarra: Star-studded international field. Click on  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  trick is for NS to stay low |pg||
nt|rv: red blooded pre-empt by Marion Michielsen|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: board one was plyed in1 NT doubled and made in CR|pg||
nt|gracelin: The 8 teams will share a pool of US$150,000 in the teams.  Another US$50,000 for the pairs.|pg||
nt|twcho: the prize money is enviable for men. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: The total prize money is US$200,000|pg||
nt|sybarra: teams from all over the world|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why not 1NT by West before you may wonder. Because they play a 14-16 NT, a popular range in Sweden|pg||
nt|cmule: ÊÖÉÏAÌ«¶à£¬±¬ÁÑ½ÐÒ²ÊÇ°×±¬ÁÑ|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcwla: On the cards and S's opening, 6@H is not an outre spot on 2, but the best-bid hand award awaits further nominations.|pg||
nt|rv: what is 4@d here by Smith, some play it as good raise in @Cs, a few others play it as both majors|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer to play 4@d as both majors 5-5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, E has a solid road here, showing @S and forcing now, can show the @H later.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: if S bids his hearts.....|pg||
nt|rv: can E-W push N-S to 3 level?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and like the typical Neth.  fearlss overcalls|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: 1@S denies a 4-card major|pg||
nt|athene: west can do something over 1@S now - 1nt, double, 2@H, 2@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: partial for N/S but they could get higher|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c bergen I think|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: par contract in 5 in a minor for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, they have very generous sponsors in this Hua Yuen Women Elite Cup|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would much rather have four counts all day than these 10- and 11-counts where you start to get your engine revved up and then shut it down.|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing Trf responses to 1@C opening that 1@s shows @d|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 3@d is touch and go|pg||
nt|granguru:  in total you may find 10.000 I am told but used are around 2000|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D coming up|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jcwla: 1@D misguided in third seat.  It's their hand - put some pressure on.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now, let's talk about this double -- or the lack of a double by the N hand in similar situations.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats what i call trump support |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and does, finally a 10 point opener gets a good result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beegen raise I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bergen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and shows diamonds. 3@H a splinter|pg||
nt|psridhar: and 3@H =self splinter |pg||
nt|athene: i certainly would not want to pass, with a near-opener and 5-4 in the unbid suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: and S decided he likes his hand a lot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C was bergen as I look at it and S upgraded his hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need this trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D Ace and @H back:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT is probably a sort of Lebensold to start a weak bid.|pg||
nt|twcho: with the winner taking 30,000|pg||
nt|twcho: and the last team will still have 12,000|pg||
nt|paulhac:  There are three events closely following each other this one, Beijing and Tianjin the later two being open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Over a more natural 1@C-1@D-1NT auction, E also could bid 3@H to pinpoint the concern.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: west did|pg||
mb|6H|nt|jcwla: Anybody have a problem with 3@D?|pg||
nt|rv: this slam is worse than 1 of 2 finesses, if @h finesse is off chances are not very bright|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally a splinter bid supports partner -a form of raise; but a self splinter suggests a good long suit that doesnt need much support + stiff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West promised a balanced hand, so East knows there's a fit and can splinter for diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the 4 matches going on in round  4 at: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=4&tourid=1174|pg||
nt|psridhar: borderline but we can see 3N is right here- West's 3@s will steer them away i expect|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, those intermediate @H spots come into play and though 3@S is thoughtful, it may give E no choice.|pg||
nt|psridhar: E may even think slam now|pg||
nt|psridhar: useful black cards |pg||
nt|jcwla: E would probably want a second @S honor to bid 4@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is Q986 enough to go for 3NT? Borderline|pg||
nt|psridhar: how would W bid @S AQXX,@H JXXX, @D QX, @C AXX ?|pg||
nt|athene: i want to get both suits into it but also showing the fifth heart might be nice|pg||
nt|rv: I like double with Wu's hand on 1@s with 5-4 in reds having passed earlier|pg||
nt|athene: it's just a matter of WHAT you bid over 1@S, not whether you bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ssbux: are they playing Lebansohl after a reversed|pg||
nt|psridhar: In my experience bidding 3N with a stopper of sorts AND length = u wont go wrong often|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the defense should be pretty easy as long as W doesn't get overly anxious and cashes out early|pg||
nt|ssbux: another unlucky slam for EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's all coming up orange so far.|pg||
nt|rv: still very decent slam just on @h finesse|pg||
nt|ssbux: yes very decent, but unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: looks like -1 again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep   could be -2 if they can get second ruff |pg||
nt|panosk: @D2 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd ruff = the same 2 trump tricks he started with?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 Nt is aking to go back to 3 @c in first stage|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and  last !!!|pg||
nt|rv: my preference is 1n from Wu's hand is scrambling even from unpassed hand to show other 2 suits (prefer it to 5-5 though)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcwla: You and your favorite partner need to have agreement on what it means: does it ask for a @D lead (so that if you don't double you are suggesting a different lead) or does it say "I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: have a 2@D rebid that they stole"?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Plenty of room for both major K's to be in N, let alone just the @HK.|pg||
nt|twcho: is this common method played in France?|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd in the end the swedes !|pg||
nt|sybarra: Star-studded international field. Click on  http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourTeamListFlag.aspx?tourid=1174  to see.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: if @h finesse is off, you need @s finesse on and black suit squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk2: perhaps 3NT should show stiff J or 10|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gracelin: north, with a little extra, may consider to take action other than 3C, but she has a boarderline hand. |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rv: atleast 55% or so |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes   perhaps  South was not  very optimistec   it  not such a bad slam!!|pg||
nt|paulhac:  All are 8 team tournaments|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|nkgupt: prefer X to be take out of opened suit (@c)|pg||
nt|rv: sry 1n sandwich nt and not scrambling |pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: I prefer the latter meaning and trust that pd will lead my suit in the absence of a clearly better alternative; however, I do have some pds who require the double if I want the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: lead of that suit.|pg||
nt|peachy: Again, remembering Precision context|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 1nt for 5/5 reds w/ lesser def|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panosk: bad break in trumps 4@H had no chance gd game though|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@D isnt simple support in @D must be 2way checkback with game forc hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  at 50 a pop, down 1 or 2 shouldn't make much difference as it's almost impossible to stop in 2@s or 2@h with the NS hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes and got many comments on the matter that  is the reason I gave a public answer...they continue...|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can wander around site and find results as well as standings|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: probably another push |pg||
nt|ssbux: ten of D, signal for S?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes  from a passed hand    it is  Take out double|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
mc|12|nt|panosk: for more info check this link http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TwoWayCheckback.html|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @d would be easier|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a hand of various judgments where each bid sort of means what its bidder wanted to mean at the time.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Exactly, Roland.|pg||

nt|panosk: there was a minor squeeze to N but thats double dummy|pg||
nt|jcwla: The upshot is to post a score that starts with a 6, and they did.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A pedestrian auction in the other room. 12-14 1NT - 3NT|pg||

nt|andyv:  this should die at 2@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: Exactly|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Exactly, Jordan|pg||
nt|psridhar: that auction is highly desirable often Roland -but this deal i admire the auction by the Swedes|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: red I doubt it|pg||
nt|athene: it is quite likely to help the opponents|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panosk: this is the best way if you play it  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C must be conventional for majors?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nicola Smith and Sally Brock are very experienced, so they will get on with life and not let these results affect them|pg||

nt|paulhac:  The first part score battle|pg||

mb|2S|nt|andyv:  EW don't have enough to compete at the 3 level|pg||

nt|rv: North's 1n shows 18-19 here|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally 9 tricks are available for N-S with lucky lie of red suits|pg||
nt|twcho: depends on the overall opening bid structure|pg||
nt|granguru:  North made an agressiv bid. |pg||
nt|othered1: Looks good enough for a vulnerable game and it's the red intermediates that make it even that good|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: The bridge Championship is being played at Shenzen, a beautiful city adjacent to Hongkong. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: catching up the scores now|pg||
nt|panosk: yes that was the threat but how can he know club honors not divided|pg||
nt|kerasidis: as it could be with weaker habnds|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hands|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 3@c maybe|pg||
nt|kemperg: did not know that, but @H had no use|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||

nt|kerasidis: there are partners with great aggrements with such hands...2@c or 3@c|pg||

nt|ssbux: as I said previously, it is unusally to start with same boards when directed by Anthony|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If I was green I might be tempted|pg||

nt|jcwla: Anyone for 2@H opening in fourth chair?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: n/S being talked out of good spot in @S's|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: confirmed by a spec, thx|pg||
nt|peachy: I really do not have any first hand knowledge, but looks like Precision|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C shows more high cards indeed so in case EW go to 5 level N doent have a clue about pards hand|pg||
nt|loe48: many use 2nt as good raise in this pos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Carl|pg||
nt|loe48: invite + in spade|pg||
nt|panosk: with the 4@S bid that is, agree with Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes many alternative bids...depends on partners aggrements|pg||
nt|kemperg: to much in @C nothing in red suits, 4@S good for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All very sensible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't this the hand for it?|pg||
nt|granguru:  Probably could not double because of conventional meaning |pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: N was a bit conservative for me shud have tried 2 spades|pg||
nt|rv: anyone open 2n (20-21) with North hand, what does K-R say?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Michielsen showing 18-19 balanced with her 1NT|pg||
nt|twcho: south is conservative not to overcall|pg||
nt|gracelin: the winner of the 8-team competiton will take home US$30,000 and the  8 also has US$12,000.  At moment, France is leading after one match and the Dutch is lying 3rd.|pg||
nt|twcho: probably deterred by the spot cards she held|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D GF checkback; i don't know what range of shapes they allow for the 1nt rebid|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@d is a FG  check back|pg||
nt|granguru:  some pairs play 1m X 1@S X as @S  to avoid psyquics|pg||
nt|othered1: The long and the short of it is don't lose more than 2 red tricks.|pg||
nt|granguru:  having all the intermediates in @D is a nice thing|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are bringing up 2 more tables shortly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: @d most likely, will cost a trick|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Ns   remained silence with 25  hpc |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 12-15 with 6 or some such|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: I suspect K-R will show more than 19 hcp for North hand, possibly not enough for 2n opening|pg||
nt|granguru:  alternative use is a responsive double the traditional way i.e. other 2 suits|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  A@h and @h|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes shape and values suit 2@H opening -but some authorites feel the hand should not have > 4 controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards not lying well for Heather Dhondy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well that @C9 ain't bad.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must still lose 2 hearts, 1 diamond and 1 club|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S should show a fairly poor hand i think; 4 of anything else must be a cue for spades|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: 20.45 per KR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And can easily go 2 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: John and Ed,,   you will be on your own for a bit  while I set those up |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: This event does not have website or any other information online|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S made on 3 so an early 12 imps to HuaChu|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@s probably denies M|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ssbux: with a passed partner, no convenient bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW need to dodge the @s @d squeeze|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: oh oh  hope we are not losing it again  |pg||
nt|paulhac:  Yes Shirley|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can build a heart trick here without too much problem i think|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|twcho: Paul, do you know about EW bidding system?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: however can't beat 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: one of those hands that cries out for a trump lead|pg||
nt|loe48: but..as crazy cards can be..opponents may have contract too..so 4s is also blocking alot same it can make|pg||
nt|twcho: and the double indicates @s suit|pg||
nt|peachy: The auction, to me, sounds like N did not believe South knew it was spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S= 1n?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I suppose Susan was afraid that if she bid 3@C she might push them into a makeable game|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl by S clearly penalty|pg||
nt|psridhar: but can be beaten yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  there is a good decision to play the hand by N if S has @SAxx|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ssbux: dangerous with 1NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: I agree with south's pass over 1C, but may overcall 1H with the N hand.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: south is bit weak   to vercall 1 Nt and has 2 cards in @h not enogh to double she estimated|pg||
nt|gracelin: not for lead directing, of course, but allows partner to join the party with suitable hands.|pg||
nt|twcho: if the @c7 is replaced by @c10, I guess many will overcall 1NT then|pg||
nt|granguru:  in order to protect the @SQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: declarer herself may seek an entry in @d queen|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|panosk: no |pg||
nt|panosk: with @D 2-2 and J10 @C dropping they can even make 3@C :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: the uppercut works !|pg||
nt|sybarra: miight get a trump now |pg||
nt|rv: will anyone in panel open 2n?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: I think 3@C is better as N will know S also have defensive values. I wud bid 4@S without @CKJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes indeed, Tommy.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on board 3 NL pir reached 3Nt which should nod be a success|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kerasidis: in one of them doubled could gain some imps|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: paying on @h after cashing the trump insutre 10 tricks  11 here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If Norths X showed spades I wonder why she did not then bid 2@H if she was prepared to stand the X|pg||

nt|andyv:  I would only because I hate the rebids|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|twcho: some imps back to France then|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe it's good for NS to defend 2S rather than bidding their 25 points game which wouldn't make.|pg||
nt|peachy: Exactly|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h7|nt|panosk: my only concern is that if opps bid 5@C pass by N isnt forcing after 4@S|pg||

mb|d|nt|peachy: NT range possibly 14-16, but we have no evidence other than bidding and the fat they play Precision :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's fine otherwise. I have a @D suit that is well worth mentioning (playing in, leading) and I don't expect the counterpart to bid 2NT, so I would open 1@D.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but most like a push board even after opening 2NT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2@s  two suiter|pg||
nt|gracelin: West cannot afford to see which minor partner has.|pg||
nt|psyck:  5@s, 4+minor, 8-10hcp usually|pg||

nt|andyv:  2@d here...pick your major|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: at last a swing on 3 NS pushed to 5 level by W's 5@D bid then X'd|pg||

nt|sharkey: 2@D forcing Stayman?|pg||
nt|sharkey: gf|pg||
nt|kerasidis: can anyone inform us pls|pg||
nt|kerasidis: from the kibbs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bertheau may just leap to game in spades now|pg||
nt|psridhar: this shd be a flat 4@s making 11 tricks i expect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would|pg||
nt|jcwla: Dhondy might have trotted out 2@D over the X.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Scientific bidding, splinter for spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: bit of daisy picking -slam chances are remote|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But are you slam-going opposite a passed hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and you are too strong to invite, so just bid 4@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Agreed.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is just helping opps.|pg||
nt|psridhar: may be KQXXX,XX,XXX,QXX and opener gets to ruff 2 diamonds..|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry even one ruff wd do there|pg||

nt|rv: 2@d shows equal length (2-2 or 3-3) in majors usually|pg||
nt|psridhar: THIS hand -if W is allowed 2 ruffs...slam|pg||
nt|granguru:  6@C 6@d 6!NT are there...7 with a good guess|pg||

pc|h7|nt|peachy: I was kind enough not to say anything about hte 1NT last hand, but the words are just bubbling on my tongue|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is just cruising for a bruising here.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H=4 card support good hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  no battle at all as S decided to open a light NT|pg||
nt|loe48: true|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume 1 NT =13-15 or 12-14|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is a nice advantage of a system that leaves that step in between.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is exactly why you need 2@C for the majors, and not 2@D or 2@H as in Capp and DONT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: standard lead onthis bidding should be trump with strong opposition in minors|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: now he has to make 6 |pg||
nt|ianmcc: could be up for another -100|pg||
nt|loe48: 13-15|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner must be able to ask for the longer with 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when she has equal length|pg||
nt|athene: north didn't want to wade in over the strong club with a mediocre 5-4; it's sad being at adverse vulnerability :(|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it os hard for N to lead @H|pg||
nt|othered1: but with @S lead is 100 percent on @C safety play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcwla: Has anyone heard from Basia lately?  We need her.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Germ|pg||

pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: I was sent a story yestaerday on Barry cranes rules for finding the missing Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: with nothing to go on |pg||
nt|sharkey: West made slam try in @D but E turned it down.|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt here is 17-19 probably, assuming they play 14-16 NT opener|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: do tell Gary |pg||
nt|rv: low @h best now|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@D not unreasonable with decent trump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see declarer coming to 8 tricks with proper defense.  With club forcing fummy to ruff, defense will be ahead.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: sure Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: either club or trump return will be fine.|pg||
nt|twcho: and good shift to @d by north|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, thougful defense before declarer's diamond losers pitched on the good H.|pg||
nt|gracelin: thoughtful|pg||
nt|psridhar: @d lead and contn =slam rt?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulhac:  Looks a fairly dull hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: but she is getting a @h|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kemperg: same in CR|pg||
nt|granguru:  usually the lead against 6NT is the one who does not give anything|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: 2@s, 2@h and 1 trick in each minor for defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: daisy-picking was a term used by Hugh Kelsey in one of his books. Don't mess around when you know what the contract should be is what he meant|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: You expect to be getting a @H lead and you have a very unappetizing holding.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: in a Major it is always over the Jack he claimed|pg||
nt|sybarra: its something about if they dont cover they dont have it?|pg||

nt|andyv:  this could easly go down 800|pg||
nt|ianmcc: It isn't obvious but that suit not good enough|pg||
nt|panosk: why S passed ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: plenty of work to do Larsson, take your time ! :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=VeniceCup&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards%2F2011Veldhoven  for ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: convention cards|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kemperg: suppose so|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no, operator will fix|pg||
nt|rv: max of 6 tricks for E-W if they cash out|pg||
nt|twcho: difficult to find the 2N bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  As Garozzo says; if you have a singleton lead it |pg||
nt|granguru:  N is considering |pg||
nt|granguru:  S might have @DQ4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Statistician - real mathematicians can't count, I am told :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: with the Major suits lying as they are this contract needs some double dummy play |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: both hands NS match very well with a double fit  very difficult to reach 4 @s|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kerasidis: no will he try to secrifise or can see defensive vallues ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: expected to beat 4@S I assume|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: ok but 4@C doesnt preclude 4@S :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree.  though they might also make 3H with D 3-3.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes because the second @s stop is almost invisible|pg||
nt|twcho: NS have won the battle with the master suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Precious practice for all the top teams ahead of the Venice Cup next month in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|granguru:  in which case returning a @D might be wrong|pg||
nt|penseur9: as you can see, only 4 VPs seperate the first and 3rd position teams...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nkgupt: only possible way....3@d(fit ) from S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rv: this deal would be more interesting in MPs or BAM than at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: this one may not be a success |pg||
nt|granguru:  but defense needs 5 tricks to beat|pg||
nt|granguru:  N does not cash the @SA in order to reenter|pg||
nt|granguru:  @C3 shows @C interest|pg||
nt|granguru:  now N has the dilema if declarer has only 1 @C|pg||
nt|othered1: I wondered about the significance of @C3 in their methods -- does that suggest that another @D not be played?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: they almost avoided the failing game|pg||
nt|twcho: there is a promotion chance with 4th @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 4th round D may put declarer into guessing the trump position to make 2S.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: I was surprised he passed 4@S...|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D made in closed|pg||
nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
nt|panosk: yes took some effort to make |pg||
nt|loe48: 2 inputs|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like this off 2 so shud be a good score for NS|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any to bid one @H after pard have paased at opening hand?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lebridgeur: I am not sure she has enough points   @d  shape etc..|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|nt|rodal f: New @H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: should be 4 * (13 choose 3) * (13 choose 3) * (13 choose 3) * (13 choose 4) divided by (52 choose 13)|pg||
nt|granguru:  Means @C strenght..if declarer has stiif @C then the correct defense would be @C to @CA then @SA and just now another @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Now you know!|pg||
nt|gracelin: West is thinking whether she should return a H after the first D, if declarer has a singleton HK.|pg||
nt|granguru:  S shows @CA also because t might be that N is singleton in the suit|pg||
nt|cmule: Î÷¼ÒÔÚ1NTºó2C±íÊ¾Ë«¸ß»¨£¬¶«¼Ò6ÕÅCpassÁË|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ianmcc: defence's start promising|pg||
nt|twcho: not easy for west to find the @d continuation|pg||
nt|granguru:  a nice uppercut|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N achieved the desired result with that x. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W is flat and minumum so should decline the invite|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gracelin: in that case she needs to take their HA before the 4th D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, Tommy, unless East has a way to deny the holding of HA in her discard.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be west shoul have switched to @h at trick 2  keeping options|pg||
nt|twcho: unless east find the K discard|pg||
nt|twcho: @hK|pg||
nt|gracelin: East should know west has two Hearts by passing 2H, so maybe he could pitch HK to deny HA.  If West has it, West will cash it anyway.|pg||
nt|twcho: then it will be a masterpiece|pg||
nt|ssbux: difficult to discard HK, what if declarer hold AQ in heart and Ax in C|pg||
nt|twcho: and one of the best defended hand then|pg||
nt|gracelin: SS, then partner won't pass 2H with a singleton.|pg||
nt|athene: quite tricky for south there without discussion, to show a good or mixed raise|pg||
nt|othered1: doesn't the 3@C bid mean *anything*?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcwla: And even then I wouldn't jump out of bed at night to write home about it.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: because she doesn't have a cue-bid available|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lebridgeur: very   bright!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2NT is a raise|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ianmcc: they need @h ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  they'll get one simply by the fact they will run out of cashers|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West might|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: low@d now?|pg||
nt|psridhar: @c ace pitching @d, @c ruff, @d to king, @c ruff, cash 2 @d pitching @H from dummy and hope for an endplay in trumps on N was a possibility |pg||
pc|c7|nt|kemperg: but I prefer 4@C cue and max.|pg||
nt|rv: good switch|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|nt|panosk: will try for K@D doubleton?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why bridge is so interesting - S never supports @C and N bids 5@C all by himself on the 5 card suit....|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: 5 was not flat as PS predicted. West underbid with 2@S over partner's double|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - 6 card suit|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|rv: not rewarded enough at IMPs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psridhar: essentially she had to hope to limit her losses to 2@H and one trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and it went all pass|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pusillanimous.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

nt|kemperg: NS did their best i|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree, slam should have been bid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd4,  3 @S went -2 |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes they got too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @s was not such a bad spot |pg||
nt|andyv:  EWW can only hope that NS have a game that's bid and made in OR|pg||
nt|kerasidis: now they discuss if WE has 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: then I understand...|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: a chance for brilliancy missed|pg||
nt|athene: i guess any jump should be a spade fit, though|pg||
nt|athene: given she didn't overcall|pg||
nt|granguru:  if they play udca not|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kemperg: E had a good rebid on 1major|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panosk: they might even have 5@S|pg||
nt|granguru:  it is a crucial moment in the defense...you must make the most significant signal possible|pg||
nt|cmule: Öé½­¶ÓÆ¾½è2¸±Âú¹áÓ®µÃ24µã£¬Õâ¸±ÓÖÊÇ6H|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  4@h vs 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: many would open that south hand 2@S|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on board 4 Arnolds suprinsingly went down in 4@s   cold despite the @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: ok, east just noticed she has some hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Yes, far more worthy of a bid than the 1@D S egested on 1.|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl could be showing majors, a common def to strong C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same story can be repeated in CR:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect the CR auction to be widely duplicated.|pg||
nt|sybarra: little imps may count  but you probably dont worry about them this early |pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16 again|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmmm|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 7 imps quite a cruel penalty really|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2@c bid was reasonable on previous board|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer had a trickier job in the other room after @CQ lead and north ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: but she played against the odds|pg||
nt|athene: trying to ruff down the @HQ rather than just taking the ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|athene: much more likely once clubs are 5-0|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: north is entiled to bid on !|pg||
nt|athene: inverted doubles would help NS here|pg||
nt|athene: so if south passes over 4@H that asks partner to double|pg||
nt|athene: now bidding 4@S shows a better hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I would bid 4@s  after  North double    not directly  solid @s in enough for  slam!|pg||
nt|athene: this is not at all clear, i don't think, for north|pg||
nt|athene: south might have a better hand than she has?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even a LOT better|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: should have|pg||
nt|athene: just give south seven solid spades and out for example|pg||
nt|athene: i would open that 4@S but everyone seems to open them 1@S these days|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 @s you mean ?|pg||
nt|athene: probably is a good idea to play forcing pass and inverted doubles after a 2-over-1|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 2@c being a gf(i supose) think they play pass and pull better so dekker is obliged to bid now imo|pg||
nt|athene: that might help a bit with sorting out situations like this one|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that is what i mean - IF they know pass is forcing, then the direct 4@S is not such a great hand|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "of course pass is forcing, it's obvious it should be" but nothing is ever that obvious, you have to discuss it|pg||
nt|nkgupt: it is for N to figure pd did not want to create a pass -pull|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: note that   the 5 level is still safe|pg||
nt|granguru:  a good philosophy|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: I thought it should be only -1|pg||
nt|blewah: i think that's the most likely scenario, Rashed|pg||
nt|rv: I like to play 2@c (fourth suit) as Inv+ and not unconditional GF here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 1NT best now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing is ideal|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasting into 3 nt  most likely |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: DF makes 7@D on this hand :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 2@c as Inv+ with opener to show 2 ranges (11-bad 14) and good 14-17|pg||
nt|gracelin: bue even West did find the 4th round D play, declarer may still guess it right since SA is sure with East after west has shown an AKQxx suit in D.  also a likely honor in H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some don't like to multi with a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have no strong feelings|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but a bit lucky; cld easily be a club ruff or something|pg||
nt|nkgupt: as the cards r...but maynot be on a diff layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Not the most beautiful hand to lead from.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D can only be hearts if weak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H was forcing|pg||
nt|athene: or just @SA10xx with west|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like a club system in action |pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe over 2NT an accepting 3@H and then back to 3NT.|pg||
nt|athene: north might be considering passing this!?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @c   0 or 1 KC ??|pg||
nt|athene: why else would she be thinking?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 KC  !!!!|pg||
nt|athene: NS play 1430|pg||
nt|athene: so 4@C known to be one key|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: does not seem obvious to North|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: Surely N is minimum for the original X?  Oh well, S would have done anyway and maybe should have to begin with.|pg||
nt|sybarra: on this bd|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11+11 = game vul I think|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 1-2 down|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer just needs to guess whether East start with AJ of trumps or AJ10|pg||
nt|granguru:  so if I play UDCA and partner plays @C3 at the first opportunity (when I have @C2) s/he is showing @CA or similar|pg||
nt|granguru:  now a difficult contract to fulfill|pg||
nt|granguru:  but also not easy to defeat|pg||
nt|granguru:  you make your choice: what would you like to be declarer or defender?|pg||
nt|cmule: ±±¼ÒÔÚ1SºóÊ×Ñ¡ÊÇ½Ð1NT£¬Æä´ÎÊÇ2c£¬ÏÖÔÚ´ÓxÆð²½£¬ÔÚÌØ±ð2hºóÃ»ÓÐºÏÊÊµÄ±Æ½Ð½ÐÆ·ÁË|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: looks like Prec|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't understand these methods :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so bidding never got to the 4 level|pg||
nt|panosk: but +300 is much beter than -100|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/senior-dhondy.pdf|pg||
pc|d8|nt|granguru:  defender wins|pg||
nt|granguru:  lets see what happens|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit sad at EW now. Do W have a opening hand?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@D x was -3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A nice way to resolve the angst about the imperfect 1NT rebid.|pg||
nt|othered1: are you talking single or double-dummy?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kerasidis: would you open W hand?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think I wud|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The favourable heart lie can produce 9 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer can make a backward finesse in @Dto win|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panosk: depends on my mood, if serious no :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: makes even on the improbable @d lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see N leading a @D nor doest it really mater |pg||
nt|nkgupt: good @h10 else @sA underlead @h and @s ruff:)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: she just had a doubt on the trump suit to choose|pg||
nt|athene: east wondering whether to continue hearts?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|twcho: without any significant spot cards, west wisely chose 4@s to be the final contract|pg||
nt|nkgupt: meanwhile  6 china did get to 4@s|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: best contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we warn them about 6 @D|pg||
nt|panosk: 6nt looks gd as cards lie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 12 in NT again a friendly K@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D I'm told is GF stayman, why he'd do it with only one major I don't know|pg||
nt|athene: no rush to try partner for the @DA, is there?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT in W or 2@D?|pg||
nt|blewah: NS would go for more if they know they also have fit in @c |pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: @CQ likely here to try to create an entry.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: quanti raise |pg||
nt|panosk: the friendliest kind |pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 5  6 @H a push |pg||
nt|henryb:  6N would look good wherever the @hK was: 2@s, 1@h, 5@c and 4@d tricks unless the clubs do not behave|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Henry :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  gm Shirley @h|pg||
nt|panosk: hi henry|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 0745 for us here, hence the gm |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or the @D do not behave H|pg||
nt|henryb:  you have 4@d tricks on any break: look at the spots|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm watching live cricket from England I bet Roalnd is too|pg||
nt|panosk: the real question here is shud he accept?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland it probably at the match  |pg||
nt|henryb:  England - India?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, and England again amassing a huge 1st innings score|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we in deep thought? or losing conex?|pg||
nt|panosk: i think thought |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D for me, welcome Rashed :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Playing 2/1, I think 2D is automatic|pg||
nt|rv: best lead, now if North can win and switch to @h, I suspect Smith will cash 3@hs and switch to @s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|peachy: We dont have access to the player's system details|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E must have a plan as he continues to force|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|blewah: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome also aria|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Gary and Raija.|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Gary|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nice play by N.|pg||
nt|rv: good play and defense|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they'll live to regret the result anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: I am happy that we now have more commentators, I was hoping to leave soon. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the more the merrier it is for me, one is quite lonely|pg||
nt|andyv:  since EW can make game, was E's 3@h bid conservative?|pg||
nt|kemperg: doubt, but we would end in 2|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wouldt either|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: 4@H makes whereas @S does not.|pg||
nt|sybarra: scary shift for declarer maybe|pg||
nt|psridhar: one adv of Multi is the strong hand becomes declarer -if u bid game|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ooer|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is the word oof|pg||
nt|panosk: that was a danger after 3@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N should possibly be converting|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see he should but at the table not sure you know to do that |pg||
nt|jcwla: I would expect some to end in 2@H after an original P by S and an NT opening by N.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panosk: bad lead for decl cant see bare K@H |pg||
nt|peachy: I think four is the perfect number, three is great too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|blewah: W bids reds and NT, E blacks only|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely end up playing 6NT or @D, as per their system.|pg||
nt|blewah: sure they are on the same wave |pg||
nt|ssbux: famous dish in Beijing, the Peking duck|pg||
nt|rodal f: PASS and use ure pard for a ree opening.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rv: high quality bridge as mentioned by Roland right at the start of this broadcast|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rnmalik: The least expected.:)|pg||
nt|blewah: i was wrong, ok.|pg||
nt|peachy: G'night all, enjoy the match!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesn't look like it thought E was heading for 6@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Bye Raija, nice sleep.|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW plays 2/1 I think - East showed limit raise with 3 trumps so they stopped in 3@S|pg||
nt|loe48: its not an opener 1,2 seat imo|pg||
nt|kerasidis: aceless with no alternative bid|pg||
nt|loe48: 3rd seat 1s okay|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: can he do 6 @d only loding 1 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be able to make it as E also has 4@C|pg||
nt|twcho: though even 3NT is cold with even break in minors|pg||
nt|twcho: but 4@s rates to be a superior contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer wisely won the first club trick, or a D shift might be damaging.|pg||
nt|gracelin: though with HA in south and, even an opening D lead will not hurt the contract.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ok 10 easy tricks  |pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks to the H10.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Some player play a response of 3@D to show 4-4-1-4 or 4-3-1-5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kemperg: N has enough to try make life diff. for strong @C|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes agree|pg||
nt|rv: now another @c, if finessed by Smith, North can win and back a @h, still declarer can get home for 9 tricks with @s breaking|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to say I prefer even the @C5 to the 7 for the opening salvo.|pg||
nt|rv: yes I like second best leads from poor suit, many experts even prefer attitude leads against nt|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here you can put on your best air of faux innocence but it's kind of a readout.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panosk: its not i agree , but im not always rational on table :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: dag i have seen you open weaker hands in 3 seat :)|pg||
nt|loe48: 7 hps :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think most players wud open - but Pass will get many votes too|pg||
nt|panosk: 3rd seat is quite different|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S 2@C gf or inv+ with 3@Ss, 2@D, less then 16 pts, 2@S inv with 3crd. end|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kemperg: no option for N i think|pg||

nt|kemperg: 6@S in CR on board 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: did I hear a sigh of relief?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Shenzen is a beautiful city adjacent to Hongkong. Was there in 1986.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no worries CR in 3N by E|pg||
nt|blewah: i@dKxx is big for E|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@C was a winner bid in board 6 in other room|pg||
nt|rv: finally making slam for E-W|pg||
nt|peachy: Running scores in all matches |pg||
nt|jcwla: E had done so well to avoid the initial @D lead but couldn't find it to return a @S even putting four in pd's hand.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: on board 6    Chinese ladies duly bid up to 4 @s|pg||
nt|athene: south was very pushy on that hand|pg||
nt|athene: basically raised a 2@S balancing overcall to four|pg||
nt|nkgupt: thought there was reason to w/ 4!'s and FV|pg||

mb|1D|nt|kiwibridge: 2@D multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one can make 6 but hard to get to|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT a much better contract than 4@S here|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 2@s has to be the min of the range for raises|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: I think they've found one they can't miss.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W hand not big enough for 4@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 6, 2@C x in CR.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: doing well for 450 odd|pg||
nt|blewah: as you predicted|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ianmcc: I still think it's a bad 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should get them to 6|pg||
nt|blewah: another example that a singleton meets xxx can be very valuable here|pg||
nt|athene: all west's 1nt bids have been a bit bent so far :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  and tried to establish her suit |pg||
nt|rodal f: On we are.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi=weak on one major|pg||
nt|ianmcc: who wants to be in 6?|pg||
nt|ssbux: Patrick, will you open W hand with precision 1NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not to stay out of slam |pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: like a wk 2 bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree, no harm to pass 1@H and wait for P's response who is not a passed hand.|pg||
nt|athene: on 4 she rebid 1nt with 2524|pg||
nt|athene: on 5 she rebid 1nt with 1444|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  still, need to guess @s Q and need K@d on side...so not a great slam|pg||
nt|rv: 2n seems to be jacoby showing 4+@s, 12+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: no no cant be S bidding 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: undo operator |pg||
nt|athene: good for her :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: 4@S is off from the top if they find the heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even now it has problems|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W is gonna leap to game on that hand then it is better to go via 1N on tht E hand even|pg||
nt|jcwla: EW eschewing any revealing bidding on a couple such auctions here, in both cases with the strong hand having a side 4-card @H suit that (besides 3NT) might also have been a ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: preferable alternative on other hands.|pg||
nt|granguru:  the lead of the @H3 ensured her max of 3 tricks in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: E in good position to check on keycards |pg||
nt|rv: seems to be conventional (possibly home-grown) treatment subsequently|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern style|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: we didn't play Board 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: after 8, we will play 6|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed, 3NT .|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's 2N guarantees 4@s...many play garbage stayman and would have to bid 2@s with S hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|panosk: E doesnt know which major but he correctly thinks its spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are various methods, my multi 2@D = weak 2 either major OR 20-22 with a 5 card suit OR and 8+ playing tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a lot of folks include a strong bid in multi  |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not as a rule with most pard's I play with on bbo |pg||
nt|andyv:  but momentum may put them there|pg||
nt|granguru:  @H means 4 +@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: or 2 strong as in NZ version|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may try 5@d now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 @h should  show 5 5    usually|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: without fit with partner, east stayed low by bidding 2N instead of 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|twcho: and with much better than minimum hand, west happily accepts the invitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2 finesses.|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  W must have realized the 4@c bid was already an overbid and did well to stop in 4|pg||
nt|blewah: agree, 4@c was an upgrade|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: I see 11 tricks, 12 made in CR|pg||
nt|penseur9: sorry to be a little quiet... like you I came here to watch the final round of this women elite tournament...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: funny USA, trying to protect the innocent, actually it's easy enough to defend|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: with  9 minors cards known in West hand , East judged that she does not care to propose her second major suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: next week in Tienjin China will see another Men's Elite team invitational with high cash prize.  USA, Italy/England, Netherland, Sweden, Norway , 2 teams from China and the Asia ...|pg||
nt|gracelin: Stars will compete in this event.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: we need help from operator or spectators to decipher subsequent auction post 2n|pg||
nt|twcho: a very sensible auction|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: that was fairly fearless|pg||
nt|penseur9: it's actually 2:15am here and my brain is a little asleep...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  right...if they had garbage hand...but since 2N over 2@h would deny a 4 card major, they would have to bid 2@s with the invite hand and 4 spades.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart pitch now will allow it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that did not happen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzmc: 2NT show 4 support|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Gary,  and many have heard me say I played in Neth.  and evey jr, youth and granny had a defense to multi|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On the bidding CR had better chance of playing 6@D.|pg||
nt|rv: conventional (read traditional) response to jacoby 2n is 3 level bids show stiff, 3M denies stiff with extra length, 3n shows extras hcp possibly 15-17 (maybe 5422), 4 level bids ...|pg||
nt|rv: shows second 5 card suit, 4M shows sub-min/min opening with no redeeming feature|pg||
nt|jcwla: I have to beg off here, thanks all, enjoy the rest.|pg||
nt|rv: there are plenty of variations to traditional jacoby and conventional jacoby is hardly played by most of the experts nowadays|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb:  Not true, Shirley. Multi can be used in any team game of 6+ boards where the players are "Flight A"|pg||
nt|panosk: yes if you dont know what to bid wait till they say their suit and then take action like double |pg||
nt|granguru:  the idea is to try to make always overcaller the initial leader|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: now she needs the spade finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: our Juniors love to play and defend it|pg||
nt|athene: can't use the @HK for a pitch in time|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry she is one down anyway|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Relaxing to know off a keycard, don't have to think.  Can't complain about this pace - halfway through in 40 mins.|pg||
nt|twcho: what is the prize size? it is comparable to this tournament?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good defence by Heather Dhondy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: but it is limited Henry |pg||
nt|rv: seems to be a very complex jacoby variation by experienced British ladies here:)|pg||

pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: and now a heart|pg||
nt|psridhar: now N needs to play that @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: to prevent dummy entry for decl|pg||
pc|h2|nt|granguru:  so 2@S just show a simple support to a 11S response|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h7|nt|jcwla: On 6, where E here jumped to 4@S after 1@S-2@S, E in the CR passed! S came in with a reopening X and NS went for 500 in 3@CX.  12 to England!|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: here's another possible slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 this time|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now here we do have a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now this is a slam and probably a flat board too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS should have no trouble getting to 6...question is if they have the tools to get to 7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: too many tricks.|pg||
nt|rv: well bid nonetheless|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: ok|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the 8, why not the 9?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C opener for NS can be weak with diamonds|pg||
nt|granguru:  and, most probably, 1@S means no major 6-9|pg||
nt|penseur9: These are: Beijing Hua Huan: 119... Sweden: 116 and France: 115 at present|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panosk: the one i like and its completely banned is 2@H weak in unknown major|pg||
nt|gracelin: But every match has a match prize.  Winner take US$1,500 and loser $500.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  That should bring England back into the match|pg||
nt|athene: east will have a shrewd suspicion that this is the weak variety, not a game-force|pg||
nt|granguru:  another easy 4@H EW|pg||
nt|penseur9: It seems probable that one of those 3 will win the tournament... although still much bridge yet to come...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: thats really dangerous|pg||
nt|rv: last part of last auction can be explained 4NT = RKCB 5@D = 1 key cd 5@H = asking 2nd rd control 6@C = yes + 3rd rd control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D = 1 major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Multi defence to 1NT|pg||
nt|rv: sry 5@h is @sQ ask, 6@c shows @SQ and @CK|pg||
nt|twcho: I suspect that it is because of the strength of Chinese Women Team.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: these are 16 boards per match  a full round robin of 8 teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: N might have perfernced @d? |pg||
nt|peachy: Closed room is either very slow, or else, tables not connected|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yuck.|pg||
nt|psridhar: may be Dhondy could have made it easier for her pd by ducking that @h 10 |pg||
nt|athene: so, the defence will start with three rounds of diamonds against 4@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rv: back to this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: nice pANOS|pg||
nt|sharkey: You open N hand 1@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brock must be happy to learn that partner has a major|pg||
nt|ssbux: The Asia Stars shall comprise of the veteran pairs Lasut and Manoppo from Indonsia, Patrick Huang and his partner from Chinese Taipei and Samuel Wan and Dereck Zen from Hong Kong|pg||
nt|athene: not much point actually - it kills a pitch on the third diamond but declarer can't need that really|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Nl regained 9 imp  when China let them play   4@h down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: No income at W so 4 is on.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwibridge: Panos sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a dangerous 5@D bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @C holding in N hand and @h holding in S hand will be hard to describe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least her majors are equally good|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kemperg: nice bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H now competitive or inviting?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Precision 2@C here, 6+ in the absence of a major, now 7+  NS will shortly be in game.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S is good raise of @D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since about 60% of our tables are now in team events, either 2-day KOs or Swiss, its not true that it is even close to barred|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: thats tempting :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i would|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or is it bad|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I don't like vul 2 level O/C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you take the money as South or just bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|rv: sitting here I will surely take money|pg||
nt|rv: at the table, I will contemplate a bit more and still take the money|pg||
nt|rv: on accurate defense it could go for 800?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price right for a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all Thx Roland|pg||
nt|rv: Hi P.Sridhar, gm|pg||
nt|ssbux: welcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  gm P Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am in full agreement with RV there- odds do not favour that 2@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: GM Andy/RV :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: high level competitors have tools these days to reach their contracts even after 2@d/2@s, so some usefulness of intervention is already lost|pg||
nt|psridhar: and the risk of going for 500/800 exixts still|pg||
nt|psridhar: exists|pg||
nt|rv: 800 is not possible for N-S, on perfect defense declarer could still get out for -500, not very costly|pg||
nt|ssbux: Sorry, I mean veteran pair|pg||
nt|sybarra: could be either |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nevena Senior has been passing all set and lost patience. She loves to bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kemperg: dbl should be inviting for me|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry 3@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Too good for 2@H?|pg||
nt|loe48: to strong for 2h non vul|pg||
nt|twcho: who will be your partner, Patrick?|pg||
nt|athene: better not pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Logically, it should be that for others, too|pg||
nt|loe48: if vul 2h okay|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, weak 2 is 4-8 with green against red|pg||
nt|rv: Brock must have heaved sigh of relief|pg||
nt|psridhar: meanwhile appreciate how much better the E hand is if one of those minor honors she has -is in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least this can't be misinterpreted as a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: pref both:)|pg||
nt|rv: yes I would O/C with KQJ9XX, AX, XXX, XX even at these colors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Marion may think that this is a slam invite since Dekkers did not bid 4@H the round before|pg||
nt|psridhar: and that hand also is 10 HCP :)|pg||
nt|rv: and still may not with just J or Q in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand her way of thinking|pg||
nt|rv: 5 level is safe, no harm even if Marion bids 4@s|pg||
nt|ssbux: Herstein?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|panosk: weak 2 is out of the question in any vul for me|pg||
nt|loe48: vul vs non vul i open 2h|pg||
nt|athene: west might be worried this is based on a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: but in my experience people cater for that far too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: just a max in other circumstances for me|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers will sign-off in 5@h quickly|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brock's pass of X must show @d , 2@d X is possibly a good spot for EW ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not bid 4@H before? Double + 4@H slam invitational she must be thinking?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: Herstein Liu, used to be my teammate but in this tournament I will partner with him.|pg||
nt|twcho: good luck Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: tks, ust try not to disgrace ourself.  |pg||
nt|jcwla: K&R 9.75 here, I tell you having all these 10's and 11's really can get to you.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Much easier to have 4 and 5's.|pg||
nt|psridhar: TWO aces the only feature of opener's hand |pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fairness, the 1NT rebid shows (11)12-14 according to their CC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 11 is legitimate|pg||
nt|athene: usually these things are just strong balanced and you should go to your long major|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: made |pg||
nt|nkgupt: this looks ;ile a big loss for EW|pg||
nt|nkgupt: not now :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kemperg: agree with you on the last hand, 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  W better lead a trump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can borrow one from E.:)|pg||
nt|panosk: if you need to open 1 is much beter |pg||
nt|gracelin: It's nice to see a natural 2D over the 1NT rebid.  Many play this as a GF check-back.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  anyone like N's 4@s bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still time for brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps S should keycard and then sign off in 5@h|pg||
nt|psridhar: Roland's point is very valid -but before that we should know whats X of 2@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding 5@h directly might give N some encouragement to bid on|pg||
nt|rv: Marion Michielsen has an excellent hand opposite unilateral jump to 4@h, a) no wastage in @h, b)4 trumps and c) all those controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double of 2@D would usually be "I want to double at least one major"|pg||
nt|psridhar: if it was a value showing X , N is justified in slam try; if it was a take out X, i think she has less cause|pg||
nt|psridhar: oh penalty X ?|pg||
nt|rv: I would treat North's hand as super-max for the auction so far|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kemperg: N agrees|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would not be my choice with 4-card @H's but they're obv on the same wavelength.|pg||
nt|peachy: North is delighted to go, five good trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the match is very tight   now 2 imps difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even @DA and a low heart through will not be enough|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and what % are Flight A ?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he can't have liked his 2@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 2 aces S must bid 5NT. GS.|pg||
nt|gracelin: then they also use 2C to force a 2D rebid to stop in 2D.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when spades arefavourable|pg||
nt|psridhar: some times defense has to be content with declarer making the contract :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: What will come back a @H or a @C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't take bets :)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk2: I suspect that not many in North America and Europe have heard about the city Shenzhen in the Guangdong province, the venue for this tournament. Shenzhen has more than 10 million ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: inhabitants!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: French pair Ns  uses only 2 @c as a check back stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @C lead would be interesting.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if K@c is lead, E needs to rise with A and return @d|pg||
nt|psridhar: N has a difficult task -if she is required to guess that her partner made a "penalty oreineted X" and changed her mind later|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  now, no worries for 5@d:)|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure if N-S playing any last train cue bids, if they play Dekkers could have bid 5@d with any sort of interest and her 5@h would state I have no interest|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h = long @H, with that suit, she couldnt possibly have expected to defend 2@H X|pg||
nt|psridhar: good, thoughtful lead -will set 5N here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like your question, Jordan|pg||
nt|psridhar: @d back is another format for submitting your resignation|pg||
nt|athene: well, sometimes a club lead would have worked better|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one probably won't make the textbooks|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what a horror double|pg||
nt|blewah: E "knew" S has his own suit|pg||
nt|twcho: a very comfortable contract for NS|pg||
nt|athene: either a club or diamond lead is asking for quite a lot from partner|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: why x in S where opps are being vul are in a losing contract.|pg||
nt|twcho: CR NS bid to 3NT and make it|pg||

pc|h7|nt|sybarra: I am told the E player is young Aussie player,   Her mother Janet Brown is a well known player from the eastern coast of NSW (she plays in a seaside town called Ballina).|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True she nows lives in harrogate England and is the partner of the Irish international Hugh McGann|pg||

pc|c2|nt|ssbux: ok, which room, Open?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West suprisingly did not continue @h losing a trick|pg||
nt|twcho: Even 4@h is not without chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe she feared partner would be ruffing with Qxx or A10x for a natural trump trick.|pg||
nt|athene: north shld duck this playing her pd for @SK and two diamonds?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|rv: North should duck this to restrict damage|pg||

nt|sharkey: NS likely to get to 3 NT here|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 10 with W having all the rest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  2+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades|pg||

mb|1S|nt|panosk: 10 actually and yes why didnt he tried at least ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 10, with all suits behaving nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: right 10 |pg||
nt|psridhar: yes-so slam on with less one card less|pg||
nt|rv: even if South had one of the minor honor cards missing in PS's example hand, LS would be cold|pg||
nt|gracelin: Now a not so routine 3NT for NS.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|twcho: and 4@h will go down if defense find the @d switch in time|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 2 @h by North|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: showing good @d   and propose for NT contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: more Precise here|pg||
nt|athene: not a very enjoyable hand to play on a spade lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: or EW may be in trouble...|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess it's a fit showing jump showing invitation strength.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  3 spades|pg||
nt|athene: you want to go for hearts but that means finding the jack right away|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck:  usually done with 5 card @c though|pg||
nt|paulhac:  So with board 3 to score England take the lead for the first time|pg||
nt|psridhar: the @C suit is fast becoming a mere stepping sttone in all auctions|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panosk: its not just the actual pts count he also had gd spots|pg||
nt|henryb:  Slam on a hook that loses|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@H down on the losing finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: What's good for the goose is good for the gander here with the ace underleads to NT dummy.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: S doesnt know N has values - unless he x|pg||
nt|panosk: he will soon :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  but this hand seems to be a good time to uise it with 4 esp woth those @d's|pg||
nt|twcho: with all those spot cards, 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3@c  shows @d and @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: even those who bid it naturally do it on 2 cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: is 1@c forcing Roland? i thk not -Bd 1 we saw 1@c all pass by W|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do not understand eigher the !@S or the 3@S. W are the badest here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 6@C was -3 to make the carnage worth 15|pg||
nt|blewah: did it really make?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: strange and defence to other contracts after preempt by P.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure Jean-Paul is right.  3C showed a 3NT invitational hand with D fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer might return a H after winning HK.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer will play on @c  for sure butwill she guess ?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kiwibridge: W keeps them out by bidding probably|pg||
nt|psridhar: but NS need to sort out if Dekkers wd bid that way holding such pattrens|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S is normally a weak NT, but the question is if you should still invite with 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: only point for consideration, would South have bid 5@d as last train cue bid with such hands?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kerasidis: weird in my opinion....N doesnt know south's 18 points hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Score another one for weak NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: to make sure she establish a 2nd H trick.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: no  3@c   shows limit fit in @d  with @c suit usually 5 4 the other way|pg||
nt|twcho: so another sensible auction leading to a cold contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: OK, Jeam-Paul must be right about the French girls bidding :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, 1@C is NF|pg||
nt|athene: well, if she chooses ace and a club, probably she should guess it right, on restricted choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: south shall x again|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats a shrewd 2@c escape attempt|pg||
nt|vugraphzmc: Bertheau played 1C on board 2|pg||
mb|5N|nt|ianmcc: could be 300|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 was not that difficult to bid on last hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats another crucial point rv|pg||
nt|peachy: Board 3 is already included in the 21 England has, it was a 1IMP for making 7, French pair made 6 |pg||
nt|sybarra: did E have a better play,  like J of hts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does she get the @D switch?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  benedct Cronier passed the hand Fiona Brown opened 1@H|pg||
nt|peachy: or is it?.  The website running score shows 16-20|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does she need the @D ruff?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: i'm a huge meckwell proponent as far as slam bidding is concerned need more than 50% chance to bid it |pg||

nt|loe48: if north bid 2h then bid 2s|pg||
nt|panosk: he wudnt run W|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: thanks Patrick :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Heart return is a sure play while to establish a club trick is not.|pg||
nt|athene: (KJ more likely than J10, after the fall of the jack)|pg||
nt|athene: also that way you get 3 clubs if the jack was singleton|pg||
nt|athene: i still don't think it's so clear to play clubs though instead of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What would you do now, double or 2NT?|pg||

nt|psridhar: can she escape for d1?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: nice defense|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he could claim only if he knew that there was an auto black squeeze on S @SK @CJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble for the Swedes is that 3NT might make|pg||
nt|psridhar: losing just 2 trumps, 2 aces and 2 @s ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and this will likely only go 1 down|pg||
nt|jcwla: They were about to play 1NT, wtp|pg||
nt|psridhar: the @h 10 is coming down, so they better set up and cash their @s in time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like this auction by Dhondy?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I know, and perhaps it was with the odds|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru:  I am guessing their overcall system but if they play as I explained normally 1NT would show 10+ FG. then 2C is Gazzilli to explain min-max hand and distribution also|pg||

nt|blewah: so he was sure @sK would be left bare by S?|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@h probably asked for 3rd round control |pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: and 5@S showed yes.|pg||
nt|blewah: they must have played together before|pg||

nt|gracelin: The 2 Chinese ladies team met in the 1st match and saw a low scoring 16:14 VP split.  All other 3 matches were one-sided.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: an  easy 4 @s|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rnmalik: you are right 2 cards of @H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: But there S did bid 3NT over 2@H.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ending trick 11 W @SAX @CJ and E last trump and @SQx so south 100% squeezed|pg||
nt|granguru:  after 2@c Gazzilli responders says 2@D 13+ any other is 10-12 nat mainly|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: to me this is the worst auction so far|pg||

nt|peachy: At first glance, I thought S had about 8 points, but it is 12...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can be 5 cards|pg||
nt|athene: now we see an old familiar bidding problem:- you double an artificial bid just to show "cards" and then you are faced with the real problem of the hand; i.e. what to do when opps ...|pg||
nt|athene: bid their actual suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@d, one or both majors?|pg||

nt|rv: in my view, I will pass 2@s with West hand, will panel O/C 3@D, I presume not many will consider 2n|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Apologies for mentioning Germany before. They are not taking part, Canada is|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  I'd bid it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had a leap to 2 nt over a minor,  never sure waht it means |pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think 6@h is too hard|pg||
nt|athene: well they obviously know what they are doing|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: I abhor that fatuous 2NT resposne to the nebulous 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: i "hate" is what is should say |pg||
nt|panosk: more or less same as what 1nt does :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: abhor = fancy word for hate :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: true but should not be bid.|pg||
nt|blewah: Precision EW|pg||
nt|rv: Nicola Smith has taken Sally Brock's 2n very seriously|pg||
nt|nkgupt: the long pause does not say that:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  both round K finesses to win|pg||
nt|othered1: These things happen when you have several chances but can't get your best suit into the auction, not that I can see an easy way to accomplish that in a standard framework|pg||
nt|othered1: Really, the aggressive 4@H bid stopped north's hand description|pg||
nt|granguru:  there will be voice from next session on|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: there was no clue for her to not take it seriously :)|pg||
nt|rv: yes:)|pg||

nt|psridhar: can EW make 4@H? |pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: has 3 losers but 4@S had 4 tough hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S by Senior a two-way shut. Either it makes, or if it doesn't, maybe the opponents can make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *shot|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  5@h asks for quality of @h suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kerasidis: about the previous....does north know that his partner has 18 points?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: with no wrk I would bid 3 @s for same result|pg||
nt|nkgupt: if it were a well discussed situation dont asume a 30 sec pause before the so called trf|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ianmcc: North has to lead Black?|pg||
nt|blewah: can make with the trump lay out|pg||
nt|andyv:  are there enough tricks on @h lead?|pg||
nt|blewah: needs to run @h from dummy twice|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may have draw too many trumps and doesn't have enough entry fr both setting up club and lead toward dummy's HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but south helped her for the H issue.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: but south hs done part of the job|pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer is home|pg||
nt|ssbux: sorry, have to go,emergency call from boss. bye|pg||
nt|gracelin: bye SS|pg||
nt|othered1: of course, if the @C hook loses, you go for an extra, -300 instead of -100|pg||
pc|sK|nt|blewah: need to ruf 1 @d only i think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to play.|pg||
nt|andyv:  harder than it looks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W tries to pitch on K@c, the contract should fail|pg||
nt|granguru:  This tournament is held in Beijing, China|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  nice play by N|pg||
nt|gracelin: south is trying to reach north for a club ruff, but that will be only defender's 3rd trick, andlast.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: Rubensohl/Rumpelsohl transfers to opps suit are generally done with Stayman w/o stopper type of hands.|pg||

nt|jcwla: E needed to take out the scissors.|pg||
nt|andyv:  very true|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to see the danger but probably a no cost play to lead a @s on trick 2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Play a @S right back before the @D ruffing pos'n established - |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the multi in CR bought 2NT which was -3|pg||
nt|blewah: ruff @d now and play another @h|pg||
nt|kerasidis: and if he does why not bidding 2 nt over 2spades?|pg||
nt|loe48: no|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rv: no entry to dummy, otherwise double finesse in @hs and hoping for 3-2 break was best chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shut was better than the word I wrote first |pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: I managed to edit, fortunately|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: justice here|pg||
nt|panosk: yes that was a lucky break|pg||
nt|andyv:  a @s lead would have tested W as both of his entries to dummy can be knocked out quickly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is very inconsiderate to have  u  and  i   next to each other on keyboards|pg||
nt|athene: could try a heart finesse earlier|pg||

mb|p|nt|loe48: thats why i mean he need to x again, to show big opener|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: sry, private|pg||

nt|kemperg: dbl and then??|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 9, 5@D x -1 in CR.|pg||
nt|andyv:  best for N to pass|pg||
nt|panosk: i quite like 1nt here|pg||

nt|loe48: 13-15. and x on same values..|pg||
nt|kerasidis: so would you stay in nt doubled with 6 points?|pg||
nt|loe48: so 15+|pg||
nt|panosk: for sure|pg||
nt|athene: can run all the minors throwing two spades from hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  8 teams participating...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panosk: more informative than mere 2@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: splinter raise perfect for N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Gary and everyone.|pg||
nt|panosk: we have the lead too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be N shud bid 2 NT over 2@s?|pg||
nt|loe48: i sit on nt x with 6 100 of 100 times|pg||
nt|gracelin: and not as much :(|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other room the opening was 1C, E was rendered mute|pg||
nt|sybarra: that made a difference maybe|pg||
nt|athene: then play a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: he knows the Shenzen tong|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not totally without risk?  Or did the XX promise a 3-bagger?|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever it shows, E can't sit for it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the typo, should have been  ½   about mid way through the sentence|pg||
nt|peachy: Nice pull, as it turns out|pg||
nt|kemperg: N will, but E|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes you get to play it here |pg||
nt|gracelin: the bottom team will only get US$2,000 instead of US$12,000 here.|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, thanks Patrick, voice commentators were discussing it & i was replying to to them based on what you said|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if artificial maybe you should come in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @C was probably "could be 2"|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: cant be all bad|pg||
nt|rv: East's hand just about minimum for t/o with this shape (4333) or would panel require a bit more?|pg||
nt|gracelin: not sure what the double means exactly.  Maybe just sort of bid something double.|pg||
nt|sybarra: instead of better minor |pg||
nt|psridhar: Bd 10 3nt came home so another gain for Eng|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wow, 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@h is truly a dreamer's bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Rashed good to have your company @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: u said she likes to bid -that @C suit is provoking alright|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like 2@S showed a major, so north bid 2@S to play if south's suit is @S or to get to the 3-level in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  you dream that S will have the right dummy for you|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could have perhaps balanced with 3c at the end |pg||
nt|peachy: The bidding diagram shows no alert, that does not mean a whole lot, unless they play 5542|pg||
nt|twcho: I will overcall 2@c and never consider 3|pg||
nt|othered1: rather 2@D showed a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: and if pard stronger i dont mind playing higher than 1|pg||
nt|blewah: and he proved he was right by misguessing the Q trump :)|pg||
nt|rv: no @c wastage and approx 14 hcp is my requirement with 4M333 shape for t/o double of minor opening|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you tommy |pg||
nt|sybarra: but maybe 2 @C meant something different |pg||
nt|sybarra: like michaels|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would probably balance|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are white!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C is fine by me, little danger of missing game opposite passed hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: I'm not privvy to their agreements nor that steady on Precision, what might 4NT mean I wonder|pg||
nt|sybarra: that puts it to declarer |pg||
nt|panosk: yes shud be torchoured a bit for his bid :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: how ever you spell tortured,  that is being done|pg||
nt|panosk: i meant tortured of course|pg||
nt|panosk: E carefully took with A@H so no clues|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N of course should pull to 2@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think with so many english words it is difficult for europeans |pg||

nt|granguru:  Bejing united, China, USA, Netherlands France Sweden England  and Canada|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have words that sound the same and spelled differently |pg||
nt|gracelin: East was hoping West can bid NT with Kx of spade, but she dorgot partner doesn't has any H stopper to bid NT.|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm i wonder if there was a subtle misunderstanding here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psridhar: factor the passed hand pd in rv :)|pg||
nt|rv: 2@D is GF checkback, 2@s showed 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: Dekkers can play this deal easily, she knows location of all honor cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer needs to play @s twice and @h once - 3 entries to dummy needs and she has 3 alright|pg||
nt|rv: she is thinking of catering to 4-1 @s break with @SAQ8X with East|pg||
nt|athene: west might have thought that 3@S promised a maximum|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kemperg: E did not go for the possible penalty pass in W, |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not a peep from EW to worry them either|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c forced 2@d I think|pg||
nt|blewah: XYZ convention or some sort|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree with 2nd double from South then N shud act|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud have ducked @D lead|pg||
nt|loe48: i mean, how much do they need to sit on it..not much hps left out now besides what he had|pg||
nt|gracelin: so eventually she bid NT herself and was raised to game.|pg||
nt|psyck:  should W have tried 3@s on 1@s then?|pg||
nt|psyck:  E|pg||
nt|twcho: with most favorable lie of @d, 3NT will roll in|pg||
nt|athene: if 2nt didn't promise four spades then maybe it should, because otherwise they might have to go to 3nt|pg||
nt|cmule: ÄÏ¼Ò¶ÄDÌ×ÓÐÓÃ£¬6µãÖ±ÆË3NT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|nkgupt: but a lucky makeable game all the same|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  this should go down 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  float the 10|pg||
nt|athene: if 2NT did promise four spades then 3@S should just say "i prefer to play spades, but i can't bid four"|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this ambitious contract  makes so  this is a good contract    - Roland says|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any open wake 2 @S?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: No opening in W so perhaps good decision|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot of bidding being done |pg||
nt|andyv:  looking at all 4 hands, EW are hard pressed to bid and make anything|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Have to go thanks all Patrick Tommy Krishna and specs|pg||
nt|twcho: bye Jean-Paul|pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks Jean-Paul, you are most helpfl|pg||
nt|psyck:  thx Jean-Paul|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Martin  another good reason|pg||
nt|psridhar: can beat with trump switch,  perhaps Decl can find the @s end play|pg||
nt|athene: we saw earlier that EW use 1nt - 2nt to show clubs, so they definitely don't have that as a natural bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  16 boards matches|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: now EW make 2NT on defence|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rv: only 10 tricks because of @c blockage?|pg||
nt|rv: East win second @s and play back second @d|pg||
nt|psridhar: rt|pg||
nt|psridhar: East shd hv won the first @s itself|pg||
nt|psridhar: but 4@S will make always|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  no useful pitch coming on J@c|pg||
nt|athene: but they might have some other way to show an invitational raise without 4 in either major|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 2@S as a range ask|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kerasidis: opps play weak nt so double can be weaker...that was my point|pg||
nt|loe48: 15+|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  somewhere the wheels came off or maybe W just decided to chance it|pg||
nt|athene: some play 1nt - 2@C; 2@H - 2@S to say "i have four spades" but others use it to show five|pg||
nt|athene: obviously EW in the latter camp|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Cannot blame E for this one I wouldn't think.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: almost|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 5@C for EW has good play in this badly distributed hand.|pg||
nt|sybarra: junky @D suit to introduce|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was a question....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2s is so automatic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact i would hope to be studying dummy about now|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you consider a dble of 2 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what that would mean|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes with north hand to confirm real suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: and hope pard doesnt leap off the deep end in @D's|pg||
nt|peachy: Playing "could be 2" club, it could even mean "got them".  Other meanings also possible, like extra values or hearts and extra values|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is brown in browning motion|pg||
nt|peachy: we've had technical difficulties, lets hope this is not prelude to a crash|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen this slow bidding before here|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@c probably promise 3+ as noted with previous board|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe lots of questions and writing?|pg||
nt|peachy: N opened 1C with AKx diam and xx clubs earlier|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont care if 1c promises 0, 2c is by default a cue bid|pg||
nt|twcho: she opened 1@d with that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C has to be a spade raise |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think |pg||
nt|twcho: only the CR North opened 1@c|pg||
nt|psridhar: 14 Roland... Sweden will approve that 1N :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: The case of the missing initial pass.|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad, 1@h by S would have been more fun|pg||
nt|andyv:  awkward dbl by W unless it shows a Major and Minor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that one will be hard to reach|pg||
nt|cnszsun: ×¯¼ÒÌ¯ÅÆÁË£¿»¹ÊÇ×ª²¥µÄÅÆÓÐÎó£¿|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S should be happy to sit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: me too Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: dangerous for us to play maybe Gary?|pg||
nt|twcho: what is 3@c?|pg||
nt|twcho: seems 3@d a better description for her hand|pg||
nt|psyck:  looking for a @c stop from pd for 3n i guess intending to go to 5@d else|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  ah, it is just that|pg||
nt|kemperg: good in honneurs, but shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  no a matter of overtricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kerasidis: the critical point was W not to get trick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: 5@SX was 500 a 5 imps to jiegao|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree but timid pass by E of NT.:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed it was|pg||
nt|blewah: i don't see very often now, with 12 count|pg||
nt|rv: this shows 11-14, it could even go upto 15 hcp in some partnerships because of 1@s is inconvinient |pg||
nt|psyck:  5@d best here with 4@s in trouble|pg||
nt|twcho: and 3N hopeless|pg||
nt|gracelin: and 3NT in deeper trouble.|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@d should be a much better bid than 3@c imo|pg||
nt|psyck:  E intends this seq to show dobts about 3N|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, I agree with Tommy, East has better bid 3D instead of 3C last round.|pg||
nt|psyck:  i do agree that 3@d would have been preferable to 3@c|pg||
nt|twcho: with east overcalling, EW bid to the unbeatable 4@s contract|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@S strongly invitational..but not FG|pg||
nt|granguru:  W has minimum values|pg||
nt|granguru:  favorable lead |pg||
nt|penseur9: 3NT should be a walk in the park |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh dear me |pg||
nt|panosk: wud have like 4 small spades vul |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H not best |pg||
nt|ssbux: can they stop in 3H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W does like her hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT will also be opened in the other room, but that will be 12-14 for EW there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and then West will not bid game|pg||
nt|nkgupt: tough cash out?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: tuff|pg||
nt|cmule: ÄÏ¼ÒÓÐ¾Ö·½Õù½Ð2D£¬ÎÒÒªÄÃ±±¼ÒµÄÅÆ¿Ï¶¨½Ð5DÁË|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: one day hopefully, we will put that to the test|pg||
nt|gracelin: Dekkers gets the message about doubt of 3NT.|pg||
nt|psyck:  W takes out 3N with no @c stop|pg||
nt|twcho: although 5@d needs careful handling to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Much depends on NT range|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and it is 14-16 for the Swedes|pg||
nt|psridhar: where is the making game ? 3N will go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did I say it will make?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: I only bid..look at the distribution....let pard know I have 3 @S  |pg||
nt|panosk: W cant acrually go higher, E might have KQ in @S|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@h is a fair game-unlucky @c break beats it|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this is a situation where you should lead aggressively|pg||
nt|granguru:  permits to lose 1@S 1@H 1@d 1@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  but many @d losers |pg||
nt|granguru:  best would have been to duck|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Thereis no point in playing negative doubles if East passes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if EW forgot what they were playing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|kemperg: no system against 1NT:(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@C by E and 2@D by W. |pg||
nt|andyv:  with 8 tricks off the top, this should be a nice pick up for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  W dbl, unless conventional, was ill advised.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a big Pass from East|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could be expensive since EW don't have a game|pg||
nt|panosk: *actually|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have other forcing bids,  dbls etc |pg||
nt|twcho: ok, delayed @d|pg||
nt|athene: too much danger the opponents have clubs and diamonds to run|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|gracelin: yes, need almost double dummy to make.  Instead of ruffing 3rd round H, declarer need to ruff out SQ before playing K, and Q of trumps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: But as other room was -2 at 3NT, EW will not lose the board here, whatever the game they choose.|pg||
nt|twcho: but at least this line isn't impossible|pg||
nt|twcho: probably one round of trump first|pg||
nt|granguru:  excelent move|pg||
nt|granguru:  in fact the winning one|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E was too strong for 1NT anyway|pg||
nt|panosk: which wud be a waste|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s is doomed|pg||
nt|nkgupt: for me outstanding lead @h|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess south felt that west was likely to have a major, for the 2@D enquiry|pg||
mc|11|nt|gracelin: you are risking Spade 5-1 to protect H 7-1.  No declarer will find that double dummy play.|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer has a dilemma without solution|pg||
nt|rodal f: A better spot then at tke last board.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: S didn't open on 11 eventually gained 2 imps for his side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: USA has two teams|pg||
nt|psridhar: nice try by Smith -played for J10X in @h with N|pg||
nt|twcho: they has scored the game bonus despite in an inferior contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They made 3NT and 4@H respectively|pg||
nt|athene: so you can get one spade away and then concede heart and ruff TWO hearts|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  results and standings for all teams at: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=6&tourid=1174|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcwla: Well it is not like there are not potential losses from failing to identify a 5-bagger major.|pg||
nt|andyv:  HongMian on roll having scored the last 24 imps|pg||
nt|athene: when you ruff a suit good you almost always want to get it going ASAP |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: routine 3NT|pg||
nt|babs59: board 11 had a weird sort of symmetry Roland...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  there must by some system glich for W not to be able to show a weak hand with the majors|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: you need the trumps for entries so drawing trumps first is a no-no|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H or 4@S by EW here should make|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  S will run to 3@c...then the fun should begin|pg||
nt|jcwla: And end - with 3@D|pg||
nt|granguru:  Vriend and Arnolds went passively over 5@S and lost 11 imps on b11|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: doesnt N have a michaels bid or something?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E better that a 2@S raise 3 for me|pg||
nt|babs59: Open Room NS bid 2S 4S,  Closed Room EW bid 2H 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Go on|pg||
nt|babs59: so the Swedes never took a bid in either room|pg||
nt|penseur9: some suggest a 5@D save here... seams resonable to me|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT force|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  nope, both of us are wrong|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, my prediction was conditional upon yours.|pg||
nt|gracelin: will West choose to play the 5-3 or 6-2 major suit game after East showed her 5-6 distribution ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Swedes are very modest|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwibridge: EW only reached 3@S so just 1 imp|pg||
nt|blewah: NS play prec|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know because I am ½ Swedish|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 4@h seems safer which can stand the punching game by defenders|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm recalling North's (Rimstedt) 1NT opening on board 1 :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  ok, so the run was to 4@c...I was just premature|pg||
nt|kemperg: no transfers on weak 1NT and no Stayman relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play constructive raises  but also some form of bergen |pg||
nt|panosk: N has a 2@H bid i think|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd prefer a 1@d opg 3rd seat here|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like a Gazzilli action.  2C either natural or 17+, 2D showed 8+ and GF Vs the strong hand.|pg||
nt|psyck:  E chooses not to show the @s's|pg||
nt|twcho: another handsome pickup by England|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Systemic|pg||
nt|babs59: true - but hardly appealing even if 9-11|pg||
nt|psridhar: After this lead the @c suit is frozen for defense ( cant play it again profitably)|pg||
nt|cnszsun: ÄÏ²»Õù½Ð1h£¬µ«ÊÇ±±Õù½Ð2d|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: bidding weak suits in weak hands -3rd seat - not a gr8 idea|pg||
nt|rv: in context of lead direction is more important than longer suit opp passed partner?|pg||
nt|othered1: I hate fast arrival auctions when partner has a very strong or almost unlimited hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  some problems with the trump suit here|pg||
nt|granguru:  but @c finesse is ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: why not 2 @S? |pg||
nt|blewah: OK, as a spec's information, they play weak NT and 4+@d, so N decided to pass in the previous board|pg||
nt|blewah: 13-15NT to be precised|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S would pull to 4@C or 3NT to play?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: favourable lead and all over.|pg||
nt|psridhar: weak hand = they are likely to win declaration probably|pg||
nt|athene: well, leading from three small diamonds works a bit better this time :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  the lead helps declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: michaels |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we call ours Truscott in Acol 1@S-3@S = good raise to 2|pg||
nt|panosk: i like hearts :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but as passed hand,  you need a tool with that hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like that bid Gary |pg||
nt|psridhar: 50% of the time pd will be on lead|pg||
nt|athene: this is a situation where you often see UI in the tempo in defence at club level|pg||
nt|nkgupt: infact if dummy had @c8 ruffs even b4 first trump (if @d happen to be 4/2) and @c9 falls single|pg||
nt|athene: in other words north cashes the ace|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: possible to give less space to opps|pg||
nt|psridhar: here smith has no problems however|pg||
nt|ssbux: 3S can be defect on trump lead|pg||
nt|rv: @s lead was best, this should sell contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: and south thinks a while then plays the 5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: on 13|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: now north knows the lead was 109x(x) not 10x :)|pg||
nt|athene: and doesn't try for the ruff|pg||
nt|athene: (UI = unauthorized information; generally from partner pausing)|pg||
nt|athene: still, north can return a diamond without too much worry here? even if east was void, and got two pitches, she can't really have doubleton club as well as doubleton diamond, so the ...|pg||
nt|athene: @CA would still make?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|penseur9: this could make but unlickly |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|blewah: not easy to find low @s from W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no small @S and would make.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes,  difficult.|pg||
nt|blewah: but what options does he have?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aspredicted, England did not bid 3NT on 13|pg||
nt|athene: that might cost if 1nt was 5-4-2-2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  interesting contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am somehow not a fan of opening NT with 5 major. 3NT makes 9 tricks but 4@H a superior contract.|pg||
nt|ssbux: too late now|pg||
nt|psridhar: more imps for them |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT (12-14)  2NT = diamonds, 3@D  all pass|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm hoping to spend Christmas with Fiona Brown in England - so I have NO bias :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: thanks, it works very well, of course as we play 4 card majors it guaranteed 4 card support|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not very likely|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: 2@S worked very well for EW here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|blewah: likely 8 trick already available for cdecl|pg||
pc|s3|nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gracelin: A,K of trump then misguess the spade may see this go down.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: wow.|pg||
nt|psridhar: i need to leave now -thx all |pg||

nt|gracelin: the SJ play on first trick helped declarer to locate where the SQ is.|pg||
nt|psyck:  was not in trouble after @s lead|pg||

nt|Walddk2: as East will show 15-17 with her rebid|pg||

nt|rnmalik: np:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: sry:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: it's the first time i do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: except when pard misreads it|pg||
nt|sybarra: that maybe is result of X |pg||
nt|sybarra: W had best find 4 @S (imo)|pg||
nt|panosk: what do you think about double as t/o from E straight after 3@C?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS almost make 3N on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I prefer 3 @S,  not resulting,  but I do not have 4 @H's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ideal Panos, says I have @H + @D + tolerance for @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pause - North "knows" where @SJ is...?|pg||
nt|loe48: well it was a marked stop as i dont like to see..but poor connection? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: May have been better take 1st @S trick here as @S blocked|pg||
nt|loe48: yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  should be -1 |pg||
pc|d4|nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|loe48: but pretty much be the same as have entress anyways|pg||
nt|kerasidis: could even give the impression that he has Ajx in spdes :)'|pg||
nt|athene: or fifth heart if not the queen|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they played ELC, then N was on track to do just that (show the 2 suits)|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are doiing fine:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed to make the contract but timing of suit play  has to be good.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E only has 6 pts |pg||
nt|twcho: east secure her contract by establishing her @d|pg||
nt|nkgupt: it sure sud be as there is no half slam bonus fr getting to 5 and making it:)|pg||
nt|cmule: HÉÏÇÅ·ÉS|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kemperg: duck and it goes of it own>)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that the X doesnt promise a bit more |pg||
nt|sybarra: from E |pg||
nt|granguru:  a good defense it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: east will try to strip the red suits then get out in @C and hope something good happens|pg||
nt|othered1: but that would be only a misdefense, I think|pg||
nt|granguru:  @H being 2-2 NS should lose 1@S @h @D and a @D ruff|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcwla: N's @S holding means S is not going to convert a X - and N not going to sit for @C's - so what is the point of X rather than a 2-suited bid that would surely slow S down?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: another big swing for Dutch here|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: dealing with todays preempts means you sometimes have to lower the point requirements|pg||
nt|blewah: and they are minotities in this world of modern bidding|pg||
nt|athene: fortunately for EW, the minor-suit aces are THIS way round :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru:  but anyhow it is a good insurance green vs red|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|blewah: minorities|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|panosk: tough call i have no positive answer either|pg||
nt|sybarra: from my point of view,  the X would include k of @H's for example|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont think its enough for a X |pg||
nt|sybarra: now, if playing neg frees,  perhaps he bids 3 @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe with spade tolerance he can bid 3 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but that cuts the possible @H fit|pg||
nt|rv: inspite of unlucky slam deal for English ladies, Dutch women have definitely played more consistent bridge and deserve this victory|pg||
nt|twcho: so some more imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|nkgupt: and the error i supose fro getting to 5@h is in 4@c imo|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Something like what happened seems relatively foreseeable.|pg||
nt|andyv:  was S hand worth a 3@c bid with this vul?|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems bad but no problems now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even now makes.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: @D switch.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  with everyon play 2way new minor and xyz and pdq, etc....2@c has almost become non existent as a spot to play|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will have to be careful here not to lose 3@c tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: depends on  meaning of the dbl|pg||
nt|jcwla: We know from 14 that the double promises short @C's|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks everybody, g'night :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  gn Raija|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kemperg: bye Raija|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit early to go to sleep at half past 8 in the morning:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: In this case yes - other times may make a difference tempo wise|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's always hard and the 3@C was vul|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h7|nt|andyv:  S read the situation |pg||
nt|kemperg: easyer, no choices to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board of this set|pg||
pc|s9|nt|granguru:  specially considering the state of the match|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcwla: Nobody has weirder sleep times than Andy.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Jordan, I'm a greek living in los angeles...my hours are supposed to be messed up|pg||
nt|jcwla: On the 1@H overcall here that played opposite a stiff - in the CR NS played 4@S-1 and gained 7.|pg||
nt|andyv:  it could have been worse|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sputtering to a slowwwwwww close here.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match coming up shortly|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: relaxed play to J@C.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Li (our excellent operator), PS, Barbara and Jordan|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|sharkey: claim -2|pg||
nt|granguru:  @CAK @CAQ or @CKQ or @CA would have permitted to win|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: why?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|granguru:  here S must play hi|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: except for over-reaching to 5n, Marion and Dekkers have played near flawless bridge here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|twcho: establishing a @h|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||

nt|penseur9: for final results (commeing soon from all tables: results and standing for all 8 teams at: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f9...|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: yes:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S by N would lead them to 6@H.|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure when we are back,    Tommy do you know?|pg||
nt|twcho: tks all. The next round will start in about 2 hours time|pg||
nt|othered1: NOrth's action helps EW here, I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: And to our VG operator and all kibs also.|pg||
nt|kemperg: just in time, my turn to cook breakfast my wife says|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant miss now|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: net wrong of closed room|pg||
nt|loe48: 4h is down|pg||
nt|babs59: Roland's not going - so the rain will stay away|pg||
nt|psridhar: Rain helped the brits out of jail last time Roland ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We just pray for rain when we're in trouble|pg||
nt|granguru:  looks like ew PLAY nfb |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and smooth operator indeed we thank you|pg||
nt|panosk: and 4@S |pg||
nt|othered1: Like it or not, I'd bid 2@S even if not playing negative free bids.|pg||
nt|granguru:  but W needs not much in front to play 3NT|pg||
nt|granguru:  and takes position right away|pg||
nt|othered1: You can't do well letting good long suits unbid, and 1-suited negative doubles are long-term losers, some spectacularly so.|pg||
nt|granguru:  a good guess in @d is practically all what she needs|pg||
nt|granguru:  here all 5+ suits were bid in  faxt|pg||
nt|granguru:  only poor S didnt have any|pg||
nt|penseur9: .results and standing for all 8 teams at: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=3b8e110d-f0e9-4f96-8c33-789427274966&round=7&tourid=1174|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  only thing going for S on 1@s overcall is the price of the bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match, enjoyed. Thanks all.|pg||
nt|twcho: tks Krishna for his valuable input and spectators for helps|pg||
nt|granguru:  N considered that S has no entry. therefore she will try base on her own resources only|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ty specs, Roland, Jordan and Germ|pg||
nt|panosk: great to be with you shirley and Gary|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may have to lead the J@s first and hope to get someone to take the Q|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not a good contract can be held out of dummy|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes |pg||
nt|rv: words of appreciation to my fellow commentators SS Bux,P.Sridhar, Roland Wald and others who chipped in|pg||
nt|twcho: round 3 will start in Beijing time 9:30 am tomorrow|pg||
nt|psyck:  Thanks Tommy, operator, & specs|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok 2 hours from now is middle of night for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: you are on your own Tommy |pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks everybody, especially the kibitzers|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kemperg: tks all see you again|pg||
nt|rnmalik: undo and np:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a precision auction here |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 25 imps in 15 boards is rare these days indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow where did 5@D come from :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland could be awake by then....I am sure you will have plenty of compamy |pg||
nt|psridhar: this is an interesting sequence that partnerships will do well to discusss thoroughly - 1@H-1N-2@s- now how doesn responder proceed?|pg||
nt|babs59: I'd happily be rebidding 3NT on South if 2S is natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that hand worth 2@S is the question|pg||
nt|psridhar: one popular method is responder starts with 2N on weak hands, direct bids at 3 level are nat and forward going|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: she who must be obeyed|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 13,  stop in 4 @H was rewarded|pg||
nt|granguru:  based*|pg||
nt|granguru:  W should have taken the trick|pg||
nt|granguru:  just because a @s now complicates the play a little|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it is hard for N to return a @S|pg||
nt|granguru:  specially with her holding|pg||
nt|granguru:  @c9 is a denial card|pg||
nt|granguru:  any way W plays the @D will function|pg||
nt|granguru:  finesse or from top|pg||
nt|granguru:  If West would have taken session would have been finished|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prefer 2@H over 1@C = 4-7 6 card suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2 top honours the way I play it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not play precision,  so no clue what is best |pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@S a safety play would work.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Ian, Rashed, Aria and all the specs for joining us|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a pleasure. Off to dinner|pg||
nt|blewah: thx everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  first break for N|pg||
nt|ianmcc: don't like @d 9|pg||
nt|twcho: a healthy win by the Netherlands|pg||
nt|psridhar: evidently NS play differently( or N plays it diff from S ? )|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@c 4@D 2@S and at least 11H|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|panosk: ne neither but 3nt looks like the gd spot to be|pg||
nt|panosk: regardless of result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mm 4 top losers and bad @C break|pg||
nt|panosk: double was inspired|pg||
nt|rv: last but not the least, our gratitude to many specs who patiently listened to all of us with their insightful comments|pg||
nt|sybarra: *company |pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: I have been informed that winners of each match get bonus points and in case of a tie both get 1/2 point. Poor losers :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will have written as well as voice commentary in round 2. Remember to use the Web client for voice commentary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is making in comfort, so an opportunity for the Swedes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: 2@S was S + minor. 3@S showed max with @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Gary and all kibs.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely we may have a new leader by the end of this board:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: confirming next round in 1 hour 41 mins and last round 2.5 hours after that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that missed game cost 10 only 2 in it now|pg||
nt|loe48: yes i like double|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Round 2 in about 35 minutes|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|twcho: EW missed the 5@c ontract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S is fine|pg||
nt|granguru:  North made the best return|pg||

nt|andyv:  seens to have little value in playin 9@d in this situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems|pg||
nt|loe48: u cant sac alone|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcwla: This is where new players start by taking one hook, then go for the drop on round two - have to stick to your guns and repeat it.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play to this. Thanks all CU.|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK thans Rashed, Andy, specs and operator.|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye everyone|pg||
nt|granguru:  Now declarer can recover her @S trick playing @HQ from hand (after extracting @DA and running @D)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: actual lead helps declarer I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no it doesn't|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcwla: Absent other considerations or information.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ah did not hear Andy and price to pay. J@S duck to W and then K@S by Ace in S and home.|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s is OK but will go down as the card lies|pg||
nt|twcho: of course, it will be difficult to find the @c fit after the preemption by NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a ps thank you to Paul Hackett who had been with us earlier en route to china |pg||
pc|s3|nt|panosk: thx Carl, Dag and Denni|pg||
nt|panosk: thx all for watching|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sK|nt|panosk: 10@s dropping helps also|pg||
nt|rnmalik: CR playing 1S x.|pg||
nt|granguru:  she played for all figures in N hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  and down she is |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
mc|9|nt|kiwibridge: which way :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: x gains 100 if down 1 - loses 170 if makes - not sure that's good business...|pg||
nt|sharkey: bye |pg||
nt|loe48: thanks Panos,Carl, and Dennis..im off too here|pg||
nt|panosk: i;m with you Carl 100% plus reveals points and high cards lie|pg||
