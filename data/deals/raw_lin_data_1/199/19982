mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: not hardly :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for NS  all opening  1-suit = forcing [usually 14+ hcp]  2-suit=10-13 HCP, 5+ suit, unbal|pg||

nt|psyck: good start for dec, he now has 6 tricks as cards are & opps likely to give 7th|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: will likely end with 3@s, 3@c, 1@d|pg||
nt|athene: south certainly can't avoid getting endplayed in the red suits|pg||
nt|psyck: dec will not touch @d on this bidding & S can be endplayed in @h|pg||
nt|athene: zia just has to play hearts early enough to take out north's entry before he has black-suit winners set up|pg||

nt|psyck: not Sabine can play 3rd @h & no more endplay|pg||
nt|psyck: *now|pg||
nt|athene: i can't believe she is thinking this long? - cash heart must be right, declarer can't have four hearts for the 1nt bid|pg||
nt|athene: cash heart, cash @DK if you want to see for sure, then just exit club, wait for @DKJ|pg||
nt|psyck: if dec has 3@d & 4@c, cashing @hq will still work|pg||

nt|twcho: by south?|pg||
nt|twcho: not easy to reach 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep -- only a very inebriated East would consider 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A @D hook and..|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: "but i had 2 spades"|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 10-13 HCP, 5+@S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 2N Relay    3@D i think = short @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm really only confident of opening bid and response|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, that's what being stated in their CC. :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rodal f: That might killed NS.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: What do 3@H mean now?|pg||
nt|athene: obviously south intends it as a strong spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you pass lots and then bid opps' suit it is natural, but not usually in a major, that promised five cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u|pg||
nt|athene: might have been easier if north had bid 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that wasn't natural for them|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S over 1@S was natural then the delayed 2@S is weaker i suppose in which case he has a super-max hand and must surely bid game now|pg||
nt|athene: probably he should bid game anyway :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: When I was younger than now I loved to follow NS as players, They are god vine.|pg||
nt|twcho: so 3@h is probably another relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fantoni will just keep asking for more information artificially|pg||
nt|twcho: thus unbal promised shortness somewhere?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it could also be 6(322)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: and will NOT have 4+ other major|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: north trying to cater for everything|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: on the right track|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: just in case 3@H is saying "i have hearts stopped, do you have diamonds stopped?"|pg||
nt|twcho: to the cold slam|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: or maybe he knows exactly what 3@H means and he thinks 3nt might be best spot|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|twcho: do they play turbo?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they do -- but i'm never sure when it applies|pg||
nt|twcho: I think it will apply here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the newcomers    NS  2 bids all show  10-13 HCP, 5+ suit, unbal    1 bids all forcing 1 round, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: the system is known as Fantunes|pg||
nt|twcho: some spectators asks: what is turbo?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|twcho: Turbo is a form of showing keycards rather than asking|pg||
pc|hA|pc|dJ|nt|twcho: when either side bid 4NT in a slam exploring auction, it shows even no. of keys|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: while bypassing means the other|pg||
pc|d3|nt|twcho: Here north, with 3 keys, bid 5@c bypassing 4N|pg||

nt|granguru:  use them as lebensohl or mouse or rubensohl or some adjunct or whatever...|pg||

mb|p|nt|boyklas: +4 afu ta spathia k ta @d einai 3-3|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|granguru:  ducking imporuves a little declarer position as the suit became freezed now |pg||
nt|mathat: now x@h to K and x @H|pg||
nt|athene: declarer lacks the entries to bring in spades, but he doesn't know whether they are 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: that is one advantage for the defence of ducking the second spade|pg||
nt|athene: if they won the ace and shifted, declarer could keep the spades in reserve|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer knows @s position perfectly well|pg||
nt|athene: but now, if he wants to take advantage of a 3-3 break he has to risk setting up another trick for the defence|pg||
nt|granguru:  because W threw @S7 instead of the @S6|pg||
nt|granguru:  fantoni couldnt know W @s cards when he started playing 9 and 10|pg||
nt|mathat: ansd cave 2@s first|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's true|pg||
nt|granguru:  fantoni plays usually SLAVINSKY leads and udca in middle game|pg||
nt|athene: @S7 was a better card then|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: sorry @S6 was better|pg||
nt|athene: because fantoni would be able to drop the big ones if he had the 7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru:  anyhow these are honest players..so the very long thought on taking or not with the @SA gives declarer a picture of what is happening|pg||
nt|athene: east can't afford a red card, but declarer is short of entries to use a long club of course|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru:  Fulvio is having trouble keeping stoppers in 3 suits|pg||

nt|athene: now declarer can cash @HAK and throw west in with a spade|pg||
nt|granguru:  a complex position|pg||

nt|athene: now|pg||

nt|granguru:  a good play ..W doesnt want to be triple squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: well, declarer knows the black suit layout doesn't he|pg||
nt|granguru:  he transfered the @c responsability to his partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok, as specs are pointing out, east can't lead a diamond of course either|pg||

nt|ahollan1: lead @C then look at your hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  losers in the minors are very hard to envision being taken care of by a 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|twcho: so Fantoni really doesn't know what is the @c holding with his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure any top pairs still play  Aces before Kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either 1st/2nd round  OR  denial cues  [don't ask]|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: D we go for a -1?|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: drop the @HK there for entry to finesse trumps then run hearts, but of course, he doesn't want to alert them to the club weakness (he thinks)|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: It would not be unreasonable for West to bid 3NT over 2@S and it would have worked well here if North leads a spade. Not so well if a heart is led because you can't take your nine ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In theory you have 9 tops, but you can't cash them all|pg||
nt|granguru:  Bridge Encyclopedia (p448) AKQxx vs xx 52% from top AKQ10 xxx also 2% better from top than a third round finess. if you have the nine it increases to 54%|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: we had only two boards in this round because of the mistake in the change of the couples|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt would be a bit of a gamble - not sure AK109xx counts as a solid suit|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course AKQ10x / xx you play from the top, but that is because Jx dropping is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't MP a gamble for a start?|pg||
nt|athene: but AKxxx / Q10 is not at all the same thing|pg||
nt|athene: because if you play from the top you have to crush your own ten|pg||
nt|athene: so Jx dropping does not help you|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think a D after 3@S is ok from w|pg||
nt|granguru:  the 9 makes a difference right|pg||
nt|athene: well dummy did have the 8 on the last trick|pg||
nt|athene: on the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but not sure that changes things enough|pg||
nt|athene: my book only had AKxxx / Q10  or  AK9xx / Q10, didn't mention the 8|pg||
nt|granguru:  a little because of J9 fallling is a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 5 minutes to the next round|pg||
nt|athene: that south hand would be too weak for 2@S for many pairs; depends on methods of course|pg||
nt|psyck: it is the same w/o the 8 Bill|pg||
nt|psyck: 8 does not change the line of the %|pg||
nt|psyck: *or the|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As for AKQ10xx   xxx, a priori, a 4-2 break is more common than 3-3 (48-35%), but odds change when the jack does not fall whan you cash A and K. Then you can eliminate the 4-2 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: breaks with Jx in either hand, and a play for the drop on the thrird round is slightly better than a finesse of the 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: AKQ10x     xx        I mean|pg||
nt|granguru:  Y Roland but they are right in the sense that being the 10 in the short hand it help less to run the suit without loss|pg||
nt|chrisky: how can you finesse on the third round?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: AKJxx     xxxx        go for the drop or finesse?  3-1 break more likely than 2-2 (50-40). Still, odds change when the queen does not drop when you cash one top honour|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|granguru:  fantoni-nunes system doesnt promess absolutely 5 cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|granguru:  get as much IMPS early in the match so you can rely on them and play easily the rest of the hands :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  Martens had a better @C than @s but gave preference to the major suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  was the price for bidding 3@s too steep for W?|pg||
nt|athene: i think most would bid 3@S over 3@C here with west yes|pg||
nt|granguru:  the loss was shared by both pairs |pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul seems pretty automatic|pg||
nt|athene: west is only worth 2@S if south had passed but you should usually be prepared to go up a level in competition to show a fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  the main loss was for staying in 2NT instead of 3@D in the other table|pg||
nt|athene: interesting here|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: declarer may refuse the club finesse on the grounds of trying to avoid a heart ruff|pg||

nt|granguru:  specially when at the other side they play the simple finesse...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|granguru:  Fantoni maximized his chances atttacking with the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: no point covering unless you can promote something for your side|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|athene: duck the @HQ was a possible play|pg||
nt|psyck: more risk of throwing @c tricks than @s tricks if pd has nothing in the suit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: north might then do something friendly|pg||
nt|athene: how many clubs does east think his partner has? @C10xx?|pg||
nt|andyv:  seeing Q in dummy, there really can be no reason to cover J unless E thinks N overcalled on Jxxxx of @cs and play pd fof 10x|pg||
nt|granguru:  @c2 would not have been covered for sure.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|athene: well, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: in my experience people always pause there with three small|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of 3@s bid by W may have led Fantoni astray in the @c suit|pg||

nt|mcphee: a bit heavy but why not|pg||
nt|andyv:  I pause because I always wonder what card will I play that partner will read much more into it than is intended|pg||

pc|s2|nt|andyv:  everything sits well for declarer except the @c suit|pg||
nt|athene: Q9xx in a minor isn't really very appealing against 3nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. when NT bidder has denied a major|pg||
nt|granguru:  interesting that Fulvio selected @h instead of @s|pg||

nt|twcho: 20|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there actually was a system in 1980s?? based on opening 1N=10-18   acbl eventually outlawed that big of a range|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it might have been 10-15, but that doesn't fit well with Tommy's typo|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru:  Again NS might get a @S ruff here.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|granguru:  but it is very much harder|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hard for EW to know which way round to play this|pg||
nt|granguru:  and declarer could still win  the hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: if east has the @HQ you want south on lead|pg||
nt|athene: if east has J10x, then Ax has to play it|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h seems like huge overbid|pg||
nt|haldun_p: good stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  almost no chance|pg||
nt|athene: @HJ10 doubleton for a start|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how W's hand improved during the auction|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is a bit odd i have to say|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after the double of 3@H that is - so you know south hasn't got @HKQ|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|granguru:  take notice of the @C8|pg||

nt|granguru:  with a @D finesse obtaining 2 discards for dummy's @Cs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chrisky: over ruf in @H|pg||

nt|mcphee: now that he split @D yes|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can hook the @D6 now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|athene: no way declarer was taking that deep finesse|pg||
nt|granguru:  @HQ or @s?|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade now declarer has to finesse trumps right away|pg||
nt|granguru:  @HQ seems better|pg||
nt|chrisky: no @S kills the entry|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: maybe martens intended @D8 as suit-pref for spades|pg||
nt|granguru:  if dummy ruffs hi N throws a @C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i bet Nunes would accept claim of -1|pg||

nt|twcho: there are six losers|pg||
nt|andyv:  the hand is too sterile to produce any chance for making 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but endplayed 4 times when defending 4-level contract isn't so bad|pg||

nt|psyck: good try, unfortunately will cost a trick|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|athene: here martens knows that if west has a "normal" 3@S raise, his partner is guaranteed to be short in spades with some useful cards, so double is a lot easier|pg||

pc|d4|pc|c7|nt|granguru:  Fantoni Nunes open all two with 9/10-13 points and a 5+ card suit, so opponents cant deduct "it is all right to enter"|pg||

nt|mcphee: 3N is going down|pg||
nt|granguru:  by Law limit I try to say that in competitive auctions with 8 cards you should compete up to 8 tricks(2-level) with 9 cards uptothe 3-level, etc.  |pg||
nt|granguru:  a mini moysean fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: only 8 tricks on @h lead with opps having 6 before you can enjoy them|pg||
nt|athene: the problem here is the lack of aces on the side|pg||
nt|granguru:  if you open with 5 cards probabilities are that you find 2.66 suport cards in dummy |pg||
nt|athene: when you are in 3nt based on a long suit, you really want "hard" side tricks|pg||
nt|athene: one ace is more use than KQJ10|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have their suit all dressed up and ready to go|pg||
nt|mcphee: the good thing about aces, is they prevent the opps from having a quick entry to the suit the establish|pg||
nt|athene: well the good thing is they are a trick which you don't need to lose the lead to establish|pg||
