nt|twcho: 5422 is not unbal?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not hardly :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: for NS  all opening  1-suit = forcing [usually 14+ hcp]  2-suit=10-13 HCP, 5+ suit, unbal|pg||
nt|twcho: Let's see how Deep Fantoni play this not so easy contract|pg||

nt|twcho: by south?|pg||
nt|twcho: not easy to reach 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep -- only a very inebriated East would consider 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A @D hook and..|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: "but i had 2 spades"|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 10-13 HCP, 5+@S|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N Relay    3@D i think = short @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm really only confident of opening bid and response|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, that's what being stated in their CC. :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: That might killed NS.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: What do 3@H mean now?|pg||
nt|athene: obviously south intends it as a strong spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you pass lots and then bid opps' suit it is natural, but not usually in a major, that promised five cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u|pg||
nt|athene: might have been easier if north had bid 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that wasn't natural for them|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S over 1@S was natural then the delayed 2@S is weaker i suppose in which case he has a super-max hand and must surely bid game now|pg||
nt|athene: probably he should bid game anyway :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: When I was younger than now I loved to follow NS as players, They are god vine.|pg||
nt|twcho: so 3@h is probably another relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fantoni will just keep asking for more information artificially|pg||
nt|twcho: thus unbal promised shortness somewhere?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it could also be 6(322)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: and will NOT have 4+ other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north trying to cater for everything|pg||
mb|4D|nt|twcho: on the right track|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: just in case 3@H is saying "i have hearts stopped, do you have diamonds stopped?"|pg||
nt|twcho: to the cold slam|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: or maybe he knows exactly what 3@H means and he thinks 3nt might be best spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|twcho: do they play turbo?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they do -- but i'm never sure when it applies|pg||
nt|twcho: I think it will apply here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the newcomers    NS  2 bids all show  10-13 HCP, 5+ suit, unbal    1 bids all forcing 1 round, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: the system is known as Fantunes|pg||
nt|twcho: some spectators asks: what is turbo?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|twcho: Turbo is a form of showing keycards rather than asking|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|twcho: when either side bid 4NT in a slam exploring auction, it shows even no. of keys|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: while bypassing means the other|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: Here north, with 3 keys, bid 5@c bypassing 4N|pg||
