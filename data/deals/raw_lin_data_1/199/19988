nt|ahollan1: at other tables  East will open 1@H  warning South of the dangers|pg||

nt|ahollan1: he is one of the very first to play Precision Club  and  helped CC Wei with some of the system formulation|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 5N = pick a slam|pg||
mb|6C|nt|rodal f: What do 3@H mean now?|pg||
nt|athene: obviously south intends it as a strong spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you pass lots and then bid opps' suit it is natural, but not usually in a major, that promised five cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u|pg||
nt|athene: might have been easier if north had bid 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that wasn't natural for them|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S over 1@S was natural then the delayed 2@S is weaker i suppose in which case he has a super-max hand and must surely bid game now|pg||
nt|athene: probably he should bid game anyway :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: When I was younger than now I loved to follow NS as players, They are god vine.|pg||
nt|twcho: so 3@h is probably another relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fantoni will just keep asking for more information artificially|pg||
nt|twcho: thus unbal promised shortness somewhere?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it could also be 6(322)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BBO only shows 1 of the 4 matches each round|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do W have press here? Agree u at the 3@HX as end.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can Huang sit??|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: and will NOT have 4+ other major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is a Chinese site that sometimes shows a different match, but not right now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: killer double|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: just in case 3@H is saying "i have hearts stopped, do you have diamonds stopped?"|pg||
nt|twcho: to the cold slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this won't make either   but it is a great contract single-dummy  [looking just at EW hands]|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: or maybe he knows exactly what 3@H means and he thinks 3nt might be best spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW  upside down count & attitude   odd/even 1st discard|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: do they play turbo?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they do -- but i'm never sure when it applies|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: A gamble from W?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H   1@H=weak NT, 2/3@H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or Nystrom -- whoever finds out @SK is missing|pg||
nt|twcho: but still he may go down in 7|pg||
nt|kareno: Makes with spades or diamonds 3-3 and some squeeze possibilities too.|pg||
