nt|mcphee: not sure what 3@C means|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c must be some sort of super accept to @h|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mcphee: big for @H I suspect|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@d is usually retransfer|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcphee: not sure I would be so anxious for a @D lead, when in fact this might place me on lead:)|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems more likely to lead @S left to his own devices|pg||
nt|blewah: yes with @c finesse|pg||
mc|11|nt|mcphee: so a possible massive beginning, a 1 imp (maybe) pickup:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: sorry, only 11 any day|pg||
nt|blewah: no even with @c J finesse only 11 ericks|pg||

nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: easy 4@H to start with |pg||
nt|othered1: A routine strong NT auction, perhaps, but today 4th seat 1N openers are relatively rare,  as someone finds a reason to open in front of them|pg||
nt|bobholl: p p p  1nt  p 2@D superaccept 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|bobholl: good ed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: And south gets a psychic 1@D in.  Wonder if they play Precision style, where a 3rd seat 1@D psyche is almost free|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|othered1: 2@S looks to be showing a @D fit as well as @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: wonder what 2N was for them|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently a raise of some kind looking at the 4@s rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Can west be t hinking?  Partner was a passed hand|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: this will be a very routine 5.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|psyck: going for some xruff maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: that may not work well if he loses 2@s, 1@h, 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, his best chance would be to get @d fin right|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|danilo1: 8 topp tricks ... but guess any lead by West will find ninth one (difficult to immagine @C lead)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d5|pc|h6|nt|skjaeran:  Still onluy 8 tricks.|pg||

pc|h3|nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not made (yet)|pg||
nt|psyck: not a great game with only 1 entry to dummy & not enough tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@H now is best|pg||
nt|psyck: would often go down even with @h fin on, & no chance here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hQ|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen really hit the best lead.|pg||
nt|psyck:  6 feet 9 inches|pg||
nt|psyck:  9.5|pg||
nt|granguru:  skov6.791338|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. since North shown 4-card @H ... not easy lead|pg||

nt|skjaeran:  Yes, he's a BIG guy.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|danilo1: starting with @C is strange play .. if 3-3, no need to hurry|pg||
nt|psyck: if it not a bad game either, with several chances|pg||

nt|mcphee: not exactly pleasing to S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: wow that is placing faith in partners @D|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be the only table that plays 2@D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcphee: especially as S:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a bigger field might be only table that plays 2D from the void side|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mcphee: and S will be thinking the @S suit is over him|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|blewah: must be systemic to obey the transfer unless u have strong hand|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|blewah: but how strong can u be in an overcall?|pg||
nt|mcphee: the great thing is the enemy have so many trumps no one can dble:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: partner who transfers very often continues by showing doubleton in overcaller's suit. very likely S was counting on/hoping for that|pg||

nt|Vugraphzcn: double was negative|pg||
nt|mcphee: accepting xfer with void is not in my vocabulary|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and feared that if he jumped that gun he wouldnt be able to stay at 2H. only guessing here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcn: he explained now|pg||
nt|blewah: as a spec pointed out, double maybe showing minors|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d8|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|blewah: but why not 1nt?|pg||
nt|mcphee: why not pass?|pg||

nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently he did try the x ruff & went down as suspected|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on 6@H good save|pg||
nt|bobholl: and a likely push|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of room for differing actions on this  hand, beginning with east's possible opening bid|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-14|mb|2C|nt|zebutin: mighty try even 7@D|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone know their 1N range?|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: the correct side will start bidding @d soon :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like their  headed to a @S fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
mb|d|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: lead was easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: NV, may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow not best defence|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dJ|nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||
nt|othered1: best defense likely would have started by south leading the long suit |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|granguru:  claim time already|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|psyck: Even with @d fin, @s will never produce trick, so may as ewll have discarded @d on @sA|pg||

mb|1S!|an|8+ 4!s|mb|p|nt|mcphee: they sure have a huge fit,,,,,,,,,everywhere!|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|marlowepi: easier if S opens, but of course few would that despite having appropriate Losing Trick Count, both majors, and vul in  our favor|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: 2@h must be the strong one|pg||
nt|mcphee: a tad weak, Magnus might:)|pg||
mb|4H|an|minimal hand|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: was 4H somehow conventional?|pg||
mb|4N|an| |mb|p|nt|mcphee: well I hate jumping to games like this |pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|nt|mathat: the kye card is Q @s|pg||
nt|mcphee: if 2@H is yet unlimited you ron yourself of bidding room|pg||
nt|mcphee: rob|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bids like 4H should be picture bids -- either showing or denying specific hand-types or holdings|pg||
nt|mcphee: to me 4@H would show no cards in the minors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: relevant features are quality of trump support and/or support, number of controls, etc.|pg||
nt|blewah: should be dead minimum adn bal with @h support|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: there is the point Aria, as responder you do not know what is a minimum|pg||
nt|mcphee: because this hand is not minimum really|pg||
nt|mathat: after the 5 @h N noose the k @h and the A @c|pg||
nt|blewah: to rob that musch space 8-9 bal point i'd suggest|pg||
nt|blewah: *much|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcphee: i am told the other table has reached 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as you say, S does not know enough about the N hand to know what his hand is worth. if N has stiuff spade, for example, slam could be laydown  even facing a HCP minimum, and N ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: might not have a clear continuation over 4H so slam could be missed|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: lets go back to what the 2@H bid indicates|pg||

nt|psyck: Hi Sunil|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi CK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in San Marino, one of the smallest countries in the world|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Ed, Bob|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a  hand that big @C systems handle quite well.|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good 7@H and biddable if S can show his singleton @C|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Henry!|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  a small @c first improuves a little defense options|pg||
nt|Walddk2: San Marino is a state situated on the Italian peninsula on the eastern side of the Apennine Mountains. It is an enclave surrounded by Italy. Its size is just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with an estimated population of over 30,000. Its capital is the City of San Marino. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe|pg||
nt|aramesh: arranging commentators for european small federation games vugraph|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: raptor would be pretty to have in W |pg||
nt|bobholl: hi henry :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry N :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|othered1: Not quite a 2@C bid, because  you run out of rebids pretty quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: BRAVE 1 NT BY e|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sunsamvar: P cud be yarborough|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some like sandwich NT (for other suits) & some like nat NT (since opps often open & respond light & steal you blind)...|pg||
nt|othered1: 7 is an excellent spot and may be biddable.  |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland has the 'R' convention closely trailing the F & G conventions in the list of avoidable ones|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: @S guess solved now so will make|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sunsamvar: 2@S transfer and 2nt acceptance|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: true CK but still a brave bid at unfav vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: playing NT as nat in that position, I would also bid 1NT|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: on their way to 7 i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|psyck:  I play 1@s by E as 4+ cards & x with less|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now making as crucial entry got|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
nt|othered1: This would be a v ery easy Blue Team Club auction, where south would show an ace and a king on his first response, then @H fit, then cue-bidding should focus on t he value of the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @SQ|pg||
mb|5H|nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 5@S-7@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller would reach this surely with their tarzan precision|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
mb|7H|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if s still interested N has an easy 7 @H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: well done..|pg||
nt|henryb:  Whatever the bids meant, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while,  Bye for now.|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and play will present no problem with @S 32|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @H 31 is enough already|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or more to the point, @h 3-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|bobholl: even with @H 40 there are enough chances|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

nt|danilo1: did it really happen?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphznq: on TGRs behalf I'd like to thank... ROLAND (for being helpful and supporting)@H@H@H... ALL COMMENTATORS (for making this event more interesting)@H@H@H Thank you all for your time ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: anyone for 2@C NV vs. voul |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 in hand is the threat but in that case Nwould have played @SK to kill the squeeze|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not me|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: now double in N ?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bobholl: and s 3@S now ?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bobholl: bid your best minor i will support you then |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  2N, in my world, says two places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: may be i direct 4/5 @D would agree @S :(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blewah: yes, that would be the intention too|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|blewah: W just wanted to knoe keycards in @s excluding in @d|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|blewah: *know|pg||
nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer should lead the @hJ next|pg||

nt|marlowepi: NS save is cheap even against the game|pg||
nt|mcphee: S building up the courage to bid 5@D here?|pg||
nt|blewah: have to do it now|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mcphee: 3@D does not do the job I am afraid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as long as the description of 1D given to the Operator was accurate, I would think 5D would be routine|pg||
nt|blewah: i use rule of 10: take a deep breath count to 10 and raise preemptively|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p!|nt|mcphee: I would not bid again as N|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H!|nt|mcphee: after 3@D I am done|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: forsing pass |pg||
nt|mcphee: well well now W came alive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if there were a chance LHO might bid 4N then i think 5D by N is fine, but you have no reason to think that will happen over 4S|pg||
nt|mathat: only 1 looses in @d|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: almost managed to push them to 6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|mcphee: which they may well beat!!!|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mathat: 5 @h askin with good @c go 6|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes Marshall|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, 4@d would do a better job|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2N as a cue bid |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: not a good stop if you make 6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mcphee: ccan, so has to bid 4@D I guess|pg||
nt|mathat: 1/2% beter the A|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|blewah: we see the @sK so it is a good stop :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|mcphee: so going back to board  7, the S player indeed opened 1@S and played the failing 4@S game|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3NT should be your favorite contract at imps|pg||
pg||

nt|zebutin: would be sad to bid 6@H after 4/5@D and see partner change it to 6@S...|pg||
nt|blewah: ow, that would be sad|pg||
nt|psyck: he should have set suit with 3@h on 2@d as suggested, then had enough options|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|bobholl: 6@S 7@D ??|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|bobholl: bit strong for a NV 2@H isn't it ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how do you guess the singleton @D as east ??|pg||
nt|bobholl: he just tries to get the contract cheap :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  @s is a strange (to my eyes) choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|blewah: setting up @h suit and assume captaincy with a void is usually tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3@S a good tactical choice |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 7@D goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  especially since it does not clue partner in at all|pg||
mb|5D|nt|psyck:  3N could be in trouble with the @c break|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: which is why i suggested that W should give up chances of grand & settle for the practical way to reach 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: east afraid of his weak @S i guess|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|henryb:  If you were going to bid 4@s, why not bid 4@c on the way?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Harald Skjæran and Danilo Stojanovic|pg||
nt|bobholl: so far for good tactics :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: very good @D Q keeps communication and not a ruff yet :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and to CK|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck:  e.g. a @s lead duck all around would probably beat 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: it worked in the end :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|blewah: yes, practical bid is a good one if you haven't discussed science with p|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: after 2@d-3@h-3@s cue- he still has option of exclusion key card ask of 5@d|pg||

nt|zebutin: or might try something that needs 14 cards on one opponent to work|pg||

nt|bobholl: seeing 52 cards is always easier :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: poor n has to find a bid |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 nt would be my choice|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N perhaps?|pg||
nt|bobholl: same choice |pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s possible but unattractive on that suit|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|danilo1: excellent by N ... he knew by the lead declarer max single @S ... to note - @SK would lead to 3NT made ... since than time for declarer to establish 3 @H tricks |pg||

nt|blewah: 2@c now|pg||
nt|zebutin: East did the disciplined thing by passing twice...i might have been tempted to bid 2@S at some point...sad to admit... :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass?????????|pg||
nt|bobholl: is that a suit ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mathat: 3 nt and 5 1c only|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobholl: strange lead if P couldn't bid 1 @S |pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|henryb:  great commenters think alike|pg||

nt|skjaeran:  Not the worst of slams, but should stop below the 6-level.|pg||

nt|danilo1: thk on 5@D ... Sould shoud bid slam (or 5@S) ... already shown no slam interest before|pg||
nt|psyck: @h drop, @d fin, squeeze, all in vain|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d8|pg||

pc|cT|nt|psyck:  with @hq & @cK known to be missing, N did not fancy the slam|pg||
