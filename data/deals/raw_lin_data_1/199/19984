nt|twcho: by south?|pg||
nt|twcho: not easy to reach 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep -- only a very inebriated East would consider 2@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: A @D hook and..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@S  a second suit is ALWAYS longer|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=@H & @D   this is a version of Ghestem|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: "but i had 2 spades"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL just shows values|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 10-13 HCP, 5+@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: the canape opening looks like big winner here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N Relay    3@D i think = short @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm really only confident of opening bid and response|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, that's what being stated in their CC. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at other tables  East will open 1@H  warning South of the dangers|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: That might killed NS.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if vP's DBL absolutely confirms a canape   4@S 5+@H   and that must be why Verhees thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: What do 3@H mean now?|pg||
nt|athene: obviously south intends it as a strong spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you pass lots and then bid opps' suit it is natural, but not usually in a major, that promised five cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u|pg||
nt|athene: might have been easier if north had bid 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that wasn't natural for them|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S over 1@S was natural then the delayed 2@S is weaker i suppose in which case he has a super-max hand and must surely bid game now|pg||
nt|athene: probably he should bid game anyway :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: When I was younger than now I loved to follow NS as players, They are god vine.|pg||
nt|twcho: so 3@h is probably another relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fantoni will just keep asking for more information artificially|pg||
nt|twcho: thus unbal promised shortness somewhere?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it could also be 6(322)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BBO only shows 1 of the 4 matches each round|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do W have press here? Agree u at the 3@HX as end.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and will NOT have 4+ other major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is a Chinese site that sometimes shows a different match, but not right now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: north trying to cater for everything|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room Brink 2@DX South|pg||
pc|c3|nt|twcho: on the right track|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i spy on the other table without login using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that also allows listening to Voice Commentary|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: just in case 3@H is saying "i have hearts stopped, do you have diamonds stopped?"|pg||
nt|twcho: to the cold slam|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe he knows exactly what 3@H means and he thinks 3nt might be best spot|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: EW  upside down count & attitude   odd/even 1st discard|pg||
pc|c4|nt|twcho: do they play turbo?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they do -- but i'm never sure when it applies|pg||
nt|twcho: I think it will apply here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the newcomers    NS  2 bids all show  10-13 HCP, 5+ suit, unbal    1 bids all forcing 1 round, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the system is known as Fantunes|pg||
nt|twcho: some spectators asks: what is turbo?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East seems to have a lot of winning choices here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|twcho: Turbo is a form of showing keycards rather than asking|pg||

pc|d3|nt|twcho: when either side bid 4NT in a slam exploring auction, it shows even no. of keys|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|d5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: defense on a very good track for down 3|pg||

nt|andyv:  losers in the minors are very hard to envision being taken care of by a 12-14 NT|pg||
