nt|djneill:  so a possibility of 3NT making there on the first brd, on weak defense|pg||
mb|3N|nt|djneill:  e.g. 2NT-3NT is a possible start|pg||

nt|djneill:  a very light 1NT opening, this is aggressive 8-11 range it seems|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|panja: 5@C better than 4@S here...on B4...it seems....4@S will go down on @C ruffs..|pg||

nt|panja: after the dbl, South is now worried about 4@S...does N have 5 or 6 Spades for his bid?|pg||

pc|h5|nt|panja: don't forget N is bidding in the light of S' double...|pg||
nt|nsriram: still why would he jump 3@S with 5 spades|pg||
nt|panja: so is likely to believe there is a @S fit if he sees 5 Spades|pg||
nt|nsriram: double jump I mean|pg||
pc|h7|nt|panja: people often jump to even 4 level...but usually that is an autocratic sign off...3@S was clearly part of a dialogue..so had to 'show' something....length as you said|pg||
