mb|2N|nt|kemperg: Hi svata Jacec and kibs|pg||
nt|kjadams: these are the two leading teams after two rounds.   de Botton has 34 VP, to Estertons 33|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello Germ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good warm up after dinner - normal contract, obvious lead, average result expected |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphznr: yes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: claim before playing 1st trick :-)|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's special teams event, details to be found here http://www.tgrsbridge.com/ |pg||

nt|vugraphznr: today we have 5 rounds (matches)|pg||
nt|bg:  S cashes 5 dia club ace and endplays W|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  RR in groups?|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  NS completed a team with decent Polish pair Gawrys-Kalita rapidly moving to the top of Polish bridge during last 2 seasons|pg||
nt|kjadams: a helpful lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the final of 1st TGR Auction teams|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@d gf stayman |pg||
nt|kemperg: Nice, transfer after 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are right Joao|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: a bit cloudy in London today |pg||
nt|jfaria:  could well be a transfer, just guessing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  with 4 loosers hard to guess a happy ending|pg||
nt|jfaria:  same result both rooms i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  even with a helpful lead, this is not an easy hand to play (or to make)|pg||
nt|baldjean: this 3nt will get into trouble. but it was logical to reach it|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: may we still have the  "Skov - Rassmusen" as tone of tha pairs from norway? Sems as as some are better to know the people.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bg: good spot for first board s/b 110|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  and margin is 13 VP till 2nd placed team|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the T can be costy...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I would play 2@c to show A@d rather than 10@c because of danger of discarding @d's|pg||
nt|jfaria:  must play a @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but they might have diffrent signals|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: or @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  the problem with playing high clubs from S is what to pitch from the dummy|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  plain board for a start|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
nt|warrens:  he could pitch a @S and a @H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bg: good contract the old moysian fit:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  elimination play now|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, without N's bid, EW may well land into 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  comfortable standing|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bg: I guess systemically that N could not bid 3 spades over 3 hearts|pg||
nt|kjadams: Perfect fit here. |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s and @h|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bg: S playing for  a club honor onside this isnt going to work|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this start, S can rely on double finess in @c, but it doesn't work, unfortunately|pg||
nt|bg: W worried about possible but improbable 5 card trump stack may now switch to dia and let them ruff|pg||
nt|warrens:  now it should be clear for W to play a @S|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|vugraphznr: not sure what Artu's plan is now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like Greek gift|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Artur's|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but that' not the end|pg||

nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: easy 4@H to start with |pg||
nt|othered1: A routine strong NT auction, perhaps, but today 4th seat 1N openers are relatively rare,  as someone finds a reason to open in front of them|pg||
nt|bobholl: p p p  1nt  p 2@D superaccept 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|bobholl: good ed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: And south gets a psychic 1@D in.  Wonder if they play Precision style, where a 3rd seat 1@D psyche is almost free|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||
mb|d|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|othered1: 2@S looks to be showing a @D fit as well as @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psyck: wonder what 2N was for them|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently a raise of some kind looking at the 4@s rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Can west be t hinking?  Partner was a passed hand|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: this will be a very routine 5.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|psyck: going for some xruff maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: that may not work well if he loses 2@s, 1@h, 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, his best chance would be to get @d fin right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks to be a dull 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: simple 3 nt with 9 (or 10) tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|danilo1: 8 topp tricks ... but guess any lead by West will find ninth one (difficult to immagine @C lead)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|skjaeran:  Still onluy 8 tricks.|pg||

nt|psyck:  2 9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not made (yet)|pg||
nt|psyck: not a great game with only 1 entry to dummy & not enough tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@H now is best|pg||
nt|psyck: would often go down even with @h fin on, & no chance here|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen really hit the best lead.|pg||
nt|psyck:  6 feet 9 inches|pg||
nt|psyck:  9.5|pg||
nt|granguru:  skov6.791338|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. since North shown 4-card @H ... not easy lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|skjaeran:  Going down now.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck:  That was Skov's height, 6' 9,5"...|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Yes, he's a BIG guy.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|danilo1: starting with @C is strange play .. if 3-3, no need to hurry|pg||
nt|psyck: if it not a bad game either, with several chances|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to  Seppo|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|granguru:  6f 9.48i|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h5|nt|skjaeran:  He could have made it by playing @DA @D after two clubs.|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad prediction 11 tricks |pg||

pg||

nt|sfoxa:  took time for count 10, i suppose :) |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  present for a start for Wigoder |pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I'm impressed of Bulgarian play yesterday, they play edexcellent bridge|pg||
nt|warrens:  very strong result for N/S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: Or areplaying board 39 and 40|pg||
nt|granguru:  if E had @cK10xx then he might have been in a problem|pg||
nt|granguru:  1@C precision, which is standard in Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: it is some modified Precision more similar to Polish Club  here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kemperg: no comparison now|pg||
nt|bg: 2nd hand should also be +110:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  they started from 39, indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  looks like partscore battle, especially after W's bid|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sfoxa:  @s game for NS, no more|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3@h would be too much at this vulnerabilty situation|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: only 2@h overcall gave NS some more space|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: we playing 31 to 40 in this round|pg||
nt|granguru:  ok |pg||
mb|4D|nt|sfoxa:  nice bid opposite passed partner - NS are out of bidding|pg||
nt|bg: this should make lose 3 hearts dia and a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  supposingly, 1@h bid was for spades|pg||
nt|kjadams: really aggressive 3N.   This is not going to do well.|pg||
nt|bg: NS destined to fail no matter where they end up|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@C is supposely Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: y|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, but I would rather not overcall 3@h with W hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sfoxa:  20 to 20 points - Roland's favourite hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but now Janet may have trouble with bidding her hand, i suppose|pg||
nt|jfaria:  micro st by E|pg||
nt|jfaria:  stolling many @c contract to NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bg: oops a little GGRESSIVE|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm. not impossible|pg||
nt|bg: aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H is competitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  I'd like to know the reason not to bid @s with W hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes, it was transfer|pg||
nt|jfaria:  or even a @h game|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: current standings in final: 1. Esterson 74VP, 2. De Botton 58, 3. Naqvi 55 and 4. Widoger 53 VPs|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  ok, landed safely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S woke up in time :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I wonder, which card E chooses for return |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  oh, I anticipated @c|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  yes, defenders have no chance to @c trick |pg||
pc|s6|nt|kemperg: @C start needed|pg||
nt|kjadams: seems that with misfit, going low can win, and 2H likely to make.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bg: I agree 2 H by N enough if South has a bigger Michaels then he will bid again|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kjadams: Good partner returning my suit!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bg: E doesnt know that N has only one spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but @s switch seems to be safe|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after @s discard from dummy|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bg: good switch now we will see if EW on same wavelenght as to count|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  admit, this time the lay of the cards isn't pretty good for EW, but playing 2@s seems good|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bg: W duck one dia continue club Q no play|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: in other systems W could do 2 @S, 4-8, 6crd|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|kemperg: 3@C must have been gameforcing|pg||
nt|kjadams: now the hard part.  playing partner for club Q not so easy.   maybe since partner did not pitch one?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E has to find return now|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bg: wrong play now 2 clubs makes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bg: had to kill dummy|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, spade return could have been better|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now will play for dropping 10@c I think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  good play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now @h ruff and @c ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: would you have bid 3@H? not me|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bg: I agree with you Sveta I do not understand why many players will bid 1nt after 1 heart instead of 1 spade|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with 4-3-3-3 split - quite OK, but this time...|pg||
nt|bg: just lead club to J and lead dia J|pg||
nt|kemperg: would have been interesting here:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may overruf, but has to play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jfaria:  very brave i guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: not me|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kemperg: no defense any more|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:  I should consider this approach - positive bid having an ace in hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bg: silly defense|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4-2 fit ugly but at 50 a trick, no serious damage.|pg||
nt|warrens:  S should know that North is trump tight.  but here it doesn't matter what he plays.  150 for N/S|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|kemperg: just collect AK of @H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but effective|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|s9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphznr: sry|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hQ|mc|10|nt|kjadams: settles for the sure set.  seems reasonable.|pg||

nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently he did try the x ruff & went down as suspected|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on 6@H good save|pg||
nt|bobholl: and a likely push|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of room for differing actions on this  hand, beginning with east's possible opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of options for the auction here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|zebutin: mighty try even 7@D|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone know their 1N range?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: the correct side will start bidding @d soon :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like their  headed to a @S fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
mb|3S|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: lead was easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: NV, may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow not best defence|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||
nt|othered1: best defense likely would have started by south leading the long suit |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h6|pc|s8|nt|granguru:  claim time already|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about this line, as opposed to setting up a diamond, but with right view in hearts D wont be needed|pg||
nt|bobholl: n can't guess the 4@H in e :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|psyck: Even with @d fin, @s will never produce trick, so may as ewll have discarded @d on @sA|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  W should find reasons to continue the bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: how do you find @SK is missing?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  no way - it seems|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kjadams: Open room North bid 3S directly on bd 21|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|kemperg: N on the brink of an invite|pg||
nt|kemperg: I couldn't|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - grand relied of a finess of trump K - isn't the good one|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl lokking for a better suit then @H?|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@d inv minors|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  or the team match pressure worked? it seems so|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @S finesse now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after this lead he will play spades from top|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and after this start, @sK is going to take the trick - declarer may be afraid of @d ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  2NT sotppers in @H and @s|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: hello|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bg: then S misplayed only made 5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bg: good decision by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hot start|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H competitive, dbl = invite|pg||
nt|barbyh: solid contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bg: aggressive E might have been better off trying 2 dia instead of 2 hearts showing 10 points or so sure spade support is weak but the alternative of 2 Hearts led them too high|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, even 2 tricks in @s for NS become problematic|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  agree - distribution encourages|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N just does not believe...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d6|nt|sfoxa:  yes, W could be hardly blamed for his 3@h bid - E may well have an ace more|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  EW have easy 3NT, but this juicy defence brings more |pg||
nt|baldjean: if N does not continue Q@h it will be 12 tricks even|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bg: E should balance I think usually bad result to let opps play 1h-2h|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|vugraphznr: what would be 3@d instead of 3@h ? isnt like better /weak support with heart fit ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this agreement suits well to the situation|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and a lot of pairs playing opps suit as maximum (passed or bid) hand with fit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bg: good thought but depends on partnership understanding Engine and caboose have to be on same track|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, this time 7 tricks are in view - not bad|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jfaria:  2@h must be @h and... with 11 cards and @h fit W decided to take a chance|pg||
nt|jfaria:  this may proove expensive|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a swing as expected on B 1|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|jfaria:  but B2 may even scores|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|othered1: North has a  hand that big @C systems handle quite well.|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good 7@H and biddable if S can show his singleton @C|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Henry!|pg||
nt|bobholl: think any reasanoble line will let 4@S make|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  a small @c first improuves a little defense options|pg||
nt|Walddk2: San Marino is a state situated on the Italian peninsula on the eastern side of the Apennine Mountains. It is an enclave surrounded by Italy. Its size is just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with an estimated population of over 30,000. Its capital is the City of San Marino. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe|pg||

mb|d|nt|othered1: Not quite a 2@C bid, because  you run out of rebids pretty quickly|pg||
nt|phil: yes, declarer gets a good count on the hand when the 3rd diamond is played. I do think its stronger for North to duck that heart though, don;t you think? |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: BRAVE 1 NT BY e|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but it will make nevertheless|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sunsamvar: P cud be yarborough|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some like sandwich NT (for other suits) & some like nat NT (since opps often open & respond light & steal you blind)...|pg||
nt|othered1: 7 is an excellent spot and may be biddable.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland has the 'R' convention closely trailing the F & G conventions in the list of avoidable ones|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt x on a @S  lead :) wouldn't have found that :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: @S guess solved now so will make|pg||
nt|phil: me neither :)|pg||
nt|phil: but even on a heart, there arent a lot of tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sunsamvar: 2@S transfer and 2nt acceptance|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true CK but still a brave bid at unfav vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: playing NT as nat in that position, I would also bid 1NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: on their way to 7 i guess|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|psyck:  I play 1@s by E as 4+ cards & x with less|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now making as crucial entry got|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
nt|othered1: This would be a v ery easy Blue Team Club auction, where south would show an ace and a king on his first response, then @H fit, then cue-bidding should focus on t he value of the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @SQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: 5@S-7@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller would reach this surely with their tarzan precision|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if s still interested N has an easy 7 @H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: well done..|pg||
nt|henryb:  Whatever the bids meant, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while,  Bye for now.|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and play will present no problem with @S 32|pg||

nt|danilo1: did it really happen?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  opne room started with  9 - so we have first comparison|pg||

mb|4S|nt|sfoxa:  oh - no need even|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: do you agree with S pass after 2@s?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  probably thet are playing variable nt or a strong believe not to open 1nt with 5 c M|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5 imps for defending in both rooms.|pg||
nt|granguru:  e shows cards not  penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: correct|pg||
nt|baldjean: this can make 6@h|pg||
nt|baldjean: but will they get there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hard to say|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS may win 6@c on @s guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5@c seems safe|pg||
nt|bg: have to be careful in heart slam a finesse would be fatal|pg||
nt|granguru:  Now sputh must think W has no 4@H, 5+@c some @s for the pass.--most problabe hand after this lead is 3-3-1-6|pg||
nt|granguru:  without @HAK|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  with N as declarer, contract is safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  same for 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baldjean: not easy to make though|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: this sequence shows medium slamish interest I guess|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, and W is probably worried about the @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: not sure about their agreement but 2nt should show some !@d values - he could have bid 2@s as 4th suit, W has nice hand to make one more step in may opinion|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, I agree. I would take that additional step too|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 2@d as 4th suit|pg||
nt|barbyh: does he know partner has a stiff club?|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I doubt|pg||
nt|barbyh: then that may be of concern|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  what would you lead with W hand after such an auction?|pg||
nt|kemperg: W almost endplayed now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kemperg: @C for me|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @s for me - both of no use this time|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d looks as the same pain|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4 diamonds, 4 hearts, 1 club 1 spade..  Needs two club ruffs, but the overruff is a problem.|pg||
nt|baldjean: probably not, but that's what an additional bid can find out. 4@s to show short @s|pg||
nt|barbyh: would be much easier to bid knowing that|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kjadams: Interesting rules question.   we all could see that 1S was down only 3 on previous board, but in Bridge, the Kibitzers can't tell the players, so if the players score it as down 4, ...|pg||
nt|kjadams: so be it.|pg||
nt|kjadams: they have to catch it themselves..|pg||
nt|rodal f: ate to see some who might well will play some good bridge for England.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: no, dnl for me|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: btw 2@s was a good decision, may would bid simply 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: many*|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  @s game looks not worse, actually|pg||
nt|kemperg: same start in OR, but S rebid 2 @S , @D was not mentioned|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: here 2@s would be 6+@s, thats what N explained|pg||
nt|granguru:  so most probable @SKxx @Ha(Q)x @Dx @cA(q)xxxx|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kjadams: we can see that Rabbi's rule works (when the stiff king offside, Drop it), but at the table, I'd probably go down.|pg||
nt|warrens:  what was the purpose of 2@D?|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Hate to see|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jfaria:  12 imps gain on B2, again as expected|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, i see, checkback for @H's|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kjadams: Let's say he starts with ace and a club...  after the over ruff, still has to guess hearts.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  and this line may well reduce declarer's tricks with 9 only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may clear @d now|pg||
nt|bg: this line guards against a heart switch but turns out ok since W has club ace|pg||
nt|bg: right if he drops king then slam makes|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks very straightforward|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|sT|nt|sfoxa:  another way possible - now W waits with @d and @cQ|pg||

nt|kemperg: @SJ and W is in trouble|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: y|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, the score is for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: nice play|pg||
nt|kjadams: The play seems very fast, and they are still playing well despite the speed.|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now they entering all previous scores to Bridgemate, so 1 minute break :)|pg||
mb|1D!|an|nat or bal 15-17|nt|bg: W threw a club after dummy threw one also|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: yes, p has no opening|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one wouldn't be boring|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, @h vs. @s|pg||
nt|jfaria:  or@d..|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: i'm guessing hearts wins at this vurn|pg||
nt|jfaria:  vuln game vs sacrifice..|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kemperg: still a mchance to miss game|pg||
nt|granguru:  a strong 2 weak|pg||
nt|baldjean: this should reach 3nt and make|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bg: EW need a systemic bid here like 2 clubs for majors|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sfoxa:  or so. NS may well get defensive in 4@s - appearing to be good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  W's hand asks for bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  very tiny multi, should admit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  and S with the same weapon|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: agree|pg||
nt|jfaria:  im afraid @h wiil not apear|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but worked well|pg||
nt|kemperg: green against red|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  then, @d comes in play|pg||
nt|bg: EW have good save in 5 hearts but will not find it unlessW bids|pg||
nt|kjadams: I am reminded that these are mostly rubber bridge players, and time is money!|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@c fortunatelly is one down|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  I wonder, if N's 2nt bid will promis minors in this situation|pg||
nt|bg: ok I understand the players can toss cards for the last few tricks faster than any operator can key them in|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru:  but 4@H isnt!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kjadams: Though bridge is a game of skill, Slam luck can turn a match, and the de Botton team was most unfortunate to lose on that board.   If slam makes, its win 11 instead of lose 11.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  nevertheless - 8 easy tricks for NS|pg||
nt|bg: 120 or 130 S passes gets the 120|pg||
nt|jfaria:  so a "minor" sacrifice...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: good point|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bg: good S should respect N decision not to accept any higher aspirations|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
nt|barbyh: however theyre off 5 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  even 5@d is far from plain play, if any|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I'm afraid Pepsi wont like last 14 imps swing...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  he smiles in face of any result )))|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S 10 ditribution or @H signal?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to bid with W hand - suit is very weak|pg||
nt|warrens:  S needs to lead a @D and not a @C here|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh yes,sorry. miscalculated|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jfaria:  N usually plays the TENS in p lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: it's not straightforward play even after @h lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C 10 was no succes:(|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hard job for E|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C and @H, but then N has to play trump|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kjadams: good lead|pg||
nt|kjadams: now needs shift|pg||
nt|warrens:  if N shifts, it's all over|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|warrens:  E really wishes he had 2 entries to his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after @h lead N knew E has at least 4 hearts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bg: can get sluff ruff if N concedes two spade tricks after cashing AK hearts and ruffing out last club|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bg: this game wrong sided  NS will pick up 2 imps if they cash out clubs|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR caught up with us|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  there are not a lot of loseres in view - but not a bunch of tricks, too|pg||
nt|jfaria:  well, those 10 from B4 unexpected to me...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barbyh: why would he hope with the diamond ace?|pg||
nt|barbyh: hop|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  this time no game for EW, but next one may be. and I don't know, if W can afford to double|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots of trump tricks were possible|pg||
nt|jfaria:  $ boards 4 majors swings, nice to watch :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: given alot of dollars:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  4 boards - 4 two-digit swing, yes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kjadams: 6 tricks in,  can try for 2 clubs and a diamond, or try to set up heart.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  and this one may appear not a push, too|pg||
nt|kjadams: the club lead broke up the diamond entry position as well.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but the matter of course may well be repeated next door|pg||
nt|warrens:  seems natural to play @C's and hope the defense gets it wrong or the @C's come home|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kemperg: only 1 down|pg||
nt|jfaria:  E hopes vanishing now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  he did his best|pg||
nt|jfaria:  sure|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S should ruff now|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but all =|pg||
nt|baldjean: well, now it does make|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kjadams: that will work!|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bg: on this vul a 2 H overcall is not that bad|pg||
nt|barbyh: nope|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jfaria:  good result foe EW|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bg: down wrong guess|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||

nt|bobholl: but in 4@S your akq of @H aren't of so much use as they were in 3NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: 3@c 1st seat vul got what it deserved|pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@H again for EW seems like normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: 4 @h same before|pg||
nt|zebutin: open something from south?|pg||
nt|bobholl: same bidding perhaps (1@H 2NT 4@H)|pg||
nt|psyck: sure|pg||
nt|blewah: 3rd seat anything goes?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Getting to 5@c is a good showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  A @c LEAD WINS THE RACE|pg||
nt|psyck:  On non trump lead, slam would have been on no worse thasn on a finesse|pg||
nt|danilo1: need to find @C lead - tempo|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|bobholl: worth 2@D (after pass i think so)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|blewah: drury i guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  south at the other table had a chance to sell to 2@d!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT migth score better but won't be bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  At this table the risk is probably getting too high after this start|pg||
nt|bobholl: west can't guess the akqj of @H :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 1@S or 2@S CK ?|pg||
nt|zebutin: 2@C ? transfer to @D?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|danilo1: but not really easy to lead @C on this bidding |pg||
pc|c4|nt|zebutin: or might be drury sure...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psyck: not sure Sunil|pg||
nt|bobholl: what did  say ?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|blewah: not very often but yes, some pairs use drury even after pard's overcall|pg||
nt|psyck: they would have used drury last hand if they played it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W better off if he withholds club jack|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|skjaeran:  Skov will accept this|pg||
nt|psyck:  my mom would lead 4th best|pg||
nt|granguru:  my granma also|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 I suppose|pg||
nt|henryb:  Boy would this go down a lot if @c were 3-0|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: or even pass|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|granguru:  but we usual mortals must suffer the defeat|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bobholl: he hasn't got his 10'th trick but @C A well positioned|pg||
nt|phil: yes, unlikely partner is underleading AKxx on this auction|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck:  Ideal deal to defend for those who forget the bidding once it is over|pg||
nt|psyck:  or those who pick the card nearest to thump to lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards it's so easy : 2@D and a @S :)|pg||
nt|phil: now East is in grave danger of getting endplayed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|blewah: right Khrisna, interesting isn't it?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sunsamvar: nice start by declaer|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  actually, nothing special - hard to imagine big score for EW in this board|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I meant  35|pg||
nt|kjadams: 3 trick swing on the lead from S vs lead from N|pg||
nt|barbyh: srry|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  just hoping for statistics|pg||
nt|kemperg: both majors?|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: y|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting variation|pg||
nt|kemperg: also a strong in it , good|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  unlucky (but seemingly obvious) game in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I think  the best line was to endplay W, playing AK @h and K@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, and one more point - one should know, how the partner reacts on such things|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphznr: in previous|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Really playing variable Nt (EW)|pg||
nt|bg: another tough distribution hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|vugraphznr: oh, you written that :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|sfoxa:  even bad trump break doesn't prevent EW from 8 tricks |pg||
nt|kjadams: 4S likely contract will go down on bad splits.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bg: N unhappy right now  smiles will come in a few minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and in this board, S is a wizzard. all 3 key cards (@dA, @hK and @sQ) are wrong placed|pg||
nt|warrens:  anyone else for 1NT?  I bid 2@H  with that hand.  seems much more suit oriented|pg||
mb|d|nt|baldjean: 4@h can be made here because 10@h drops on second @h trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  supposing, E doesn't start with trumps|pg||
nt|bg: I guess the S stands for Sylvia:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  )))|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  carefull defence is necessary to beat it|pg||
nt|jfaria:  x from E fit showing?|pg||
nt|kjadams: I like 2H.|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 2@h  for me|pg||
nt|barbyh: well how does he know the king isnt dropping on the second trick?|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3nt makes too though|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: provided E gets dia right|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, not a @h lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: friendly lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  7 tricks from top|pg||
nt|granguru:  needing to promote 2 more|pg||
nt|granguru:  chances: @H finesse and @H 3-3 |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  main point - to believe in it|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kemperg: is it a 55 at least? I dont understand the 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: it was explained as 55 but if 54 then 5@s and 4@h|pg||
nt|bg: dia king now should ask for heart qwitch|pg||
nt|bg: switch|pg||
nt|kjadams: DQ would.  Some play King just shows Q.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kemperg: to late now|pg||
nt|barbyh: fine lead for defense|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  yes, one more challenge for E|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but 55 in principle|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK ty now itys clearto me|pg||
nt|kemperg: typing almost as bad as my chipps at golf to day:(|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C start was needed|pg||
nt|bg: good partnership understanding here most pairs would not have 3 clubs in their system to show the S hand|pg||
nt|bg: good point|pg||
nt|granguru:  @H finesse and @D |pg||
nt|granguru:  @d 3-3|pg||
nt|granguru:  d@D 4-2 with Hx falling|pg||
nt|granguru:  @d QJ onside|pg||
nt|granguru:  @S QJ alone|pg||
nt|granguru:  and a red trick|pg||
nt|granguru:  so best is to attack @D|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now if E ducks W has no easy exit|pg||
nt|granguru:  E must overtake and repeat|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|kemperg: wont have E in|pg||
nt|granguru:  asked@S with @C9|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: he should play 6@c as neutral card|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I guess|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: x was explained as extras, probably @s support|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznr: now Nick knows N has A@d and K@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: S would continue spades otherwise|pg||
nt|rodal f: Must admit that I was wrong. By bridge we alway shall lowe eack other and acsept as all. Sorrt. I failed a lot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphznr: but spade switch is still dangerous for declarer|pg||
nt|granguru:  e asked @s not to promote @s trcks but to cut communications to dummmy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jfaria:  thx Jacek|pg||
nt|kjadams: tough hand|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like reasonable save. may be a push, all in all?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|kemperg: try @S , 9 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru:  trying to protect his @H tricks|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|bg: any line now leads to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jfaria:  the point for nonexperts: after a nt opening, a transfer from p , x cant be punishing :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: It's been 25 yearts since I have played 4 card majors, but we would bid our lowest 4 card suit.  Interesting the major despite 4 diamonds.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|bobholl: who should open ? west for the lead ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: make your choice 1 2 3 4 @H or 1@S :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: this is cheaper :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: yes, 1@h double a good idea at the vul & with passed hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|zebutin: yes...i must admit i couldn't have passed with Wests hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 5@H is cheap |pg||
nt|marlowepi: not ao cheap if opps bid 6D|pg||
nt|phil: 1 looks sort of obvious to me even if you play wide ranging preempts|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H goes for 800 so better pass :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that D by N. maybe 4H is better, planning to correct spades to NT for minors|pg||
nt|phil: with a void heart, its unlikely the w/r opponents are bidding 4@h, so maybe the mild overbid of 4N is best? |pg||
nt|phil: *likely|pg||
nt|phil: I think East will get away with 5@h here if he bids it|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  4@h looks like a better contract than 3NT.|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry even 6@H goes for only 500 :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck:  4@h could make even if you get trumps wrong|pg||
nt|bobholl: only objection against double is only 3 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like any plan that strongly emphasizes the minors, as pd is likely to have a fit. i think the double was based on the fear that S had 18 balanced and that 3N was the only game. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: narrow target to try to hit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|skjaeran:  Can discard a spade on clubs.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 3@D would be forcing, ! would choose 3@D rather than jump to 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
mc|12|nt|psyck: 2@h must have shown an intermediate hand with 5@h & W was not interested in game opp less than strong @c opening values|pg||
nt|zebutin: and some might even bid with Easts hand something like balancing 1nt|pg||
pg||

nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||

nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
nt|danilo1: East hand on limit to make slam try in @C ... and West's one on limit to accept it ... together - slam danger |pg||
nt|granguru:  3@D is a slam invitation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has a whopper of a 1N bid. 2C worth considering as alternative|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has a nasty guess between the majors but he gambled rigth|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: if 3@D is transfer  worth 4@H ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N with good @h support and no @c stopper|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  4@s is a sensible contract, just needing the @hA onside. It isn't.|pg||
nt|bobholl: both bidding strange but 3nt is only makeable game bridge is a funny game :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks, Krishna|pg||
pc|c3|nt|granguru:  thats why W is considering ..|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H positive response|pg||
nt|granguru:  probably in 1 minor|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  EW is not a regular partnership. Hope they know what they're doing now.|pg||
nt|granguru:  not known|pg||
nt|psyck:  Other room E knew pd had 4 carder @h with likely some wastage, after kickback revealed an ace missing, maybe should stop in game with min hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: 3@d may have just been a 2nd relay, G|pg||
pc|cK|nt|blewah: i think just relay|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|mathat: after A @s play @h and finesse @c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru:  4@c looks agrees trump|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s7|nt|henryb:  This should be 12 imps to Luxenbourg, which will essentially tie the match|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has to lead a @C in time but i guess he will |pg||
nt|henryb:  BTW, is there a website for standings?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  4@H no @d control|pg||
nt|granguru:  only a @d lead permits to win|pg||
nt|psyck:  i've no idea what the bids mean here, but looks like they knew what they meant to do|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: all event details can be found here: www.tgrsbridge.com|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bobholl: there is i guess but don't know whre|pg||
pc|sT|nt|zebutin: now little easier, but if they drive @S A down, you must feel little uneasy that @C finese isn't actually working|pg||
nt|zebutin: even if it works for the 1st time you take it that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: where|pg||
pc|s9|nt|granguru:  made!|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure if they had this option (lot of partnerships use it) - but if possible, better would be to transfer in @C and show slam try with @H single/void ... West would than ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: probably not accept|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|granguru:  no still another loser|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: some discussion at the table about  prev board but dont know Bulgarian :/|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  still no push :) what a final match!|pg||
nt|jfaria:  to loose just 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: well done at both tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  they are fast - 7 boards in half-an-hour and little bit more|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-14|nt|granguru:  7@d anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: very fast|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  special challenge for the operator :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I've done more challenging ones :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: another 8 suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  a good 3nt here, but have to get there first.|pg||
nt|granguru:  bad response |pg||
nt|granguru:  momentaneously|pg||
mb|2C|nt|warrens:  maybe 2@D now, followed by 3@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kjadams: Many pairs play transfer advances of partners major after a negative double.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: where transfer to opps suit = limit raise|pg||
nt|warrens:  or even followed by 2N here|pg||
nt|warrens:  i admit, i didn't expect 2@S|pg||
nt|granguru:  a tough response now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bg: here is a great slam make 7 double dummy|pg||
nt|barbyh: lost the sp suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  @h fit is discovered, but right contract is NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  fine boards for the last match, when swings are necessary )))|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: other table 4hxx ... in prev , now playing|pg||
nt|bg: 2 D should be about a 10 point raise N should bid 2 spades and thats it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: do the Romanians have Bulgarian?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS are from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeh, but their opps not|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: if -1 no bid deal :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: hmmm|pg||
nt|granguru:  2NT conventional|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  from one hand, 5@d is a good save, from another - you may well force your opps to go higher|pg||
nt|kjadams: transfer to our suit = constructive raise, and bidding our suit is garbage.|pg||
nt|bg: not sure what 2 H meant|pg||
nt|kjadams: let's hope they do not both try double moysian spade fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now they are on their way|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kemperg: 1 down at least|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  Herman team got hard stroke in  1, when EW next door bid and went down in 3NT, but now, imp by imp, they gain the lead|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2H should be a last train type of game try in case 2D stronger than limit.|pg||
nt|granguru:  E didnt transfered with such a strong hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  after @dQ falls, only @h finess is necessary|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  obvious 3NT, but after informative bidding|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kjadams: this does not look to be  a pretty contract.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jfaria:  same ten tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru:  now things became better|pg||
nt|granguru:  WE HAVE A FIT|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa:  normal line of play in @h brings 9th trick|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|nt|kjadams: Seems to me that east was worth a direct 2S Q|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: well done!|pg||
nt|granguru:  5NT 2KC + useful void|pg||
nt|granguru:  loks like -1|pg||
nt|granguru:  results of the tourney are on SWAN|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: oh, down one , bad @h break|pg||
nt|granguru:   http://www.tgrsbridge.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but I like bidding anyway|pg||
nt|granguru:  N can be squeezed in @S and @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes but what is the most percentage line of play|pg||
nt|granguru:  I must congratulate the audience|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are we to see a nive spot home? 2-2 @S out are a spot in at NS.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, this has to be doomed.  seems like an easy hand to defend.|pg||
nt|granguru:  9 proposed the @H@S squeeze|pg||
nt|granguru:  included Fragos007 of course|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hJ|nt|jfaria:  a no swing board? :)|pg||
nt|bg: all lines of play work here but declarer not sure of any of them|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's true|pg||
nt|rodal f: But seemed wrong by them|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kjadams: From South's perspective, North was 4-4 in majors.   Maybe next time bid 5 card suit in response to Q bid.|pg||

mb|d|nt|marlowepi: 1H ? why not X ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: 4@H no aces and the optimum contract in the best hand :)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: me and my partner would have done not that good on this one 1nt 2@C and than 4@H :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||

pc|d7|pg||

nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||

nt|zebutin: would be sad to bid 6@H after 4/5@D and see partner change it to 6@S...|pg||
nt|blewah: ow, that would be sad|pg||
nt|psyck: he should have set suit with 3@h on 2@d as suggested, then had enough options|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|bobholl: 6@S 7@D ??|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bobholl: bit strong for a NV 2@H isn't it ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how do you guess the singleton @D as east ??|pg||
nt|bobholl: he just tries to get the contract cheap :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  @s is a strange (to my eyes) choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: tempting to pass with those club tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt looks sound enough but on a @S lead not that good :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: setting up @h suit and assume captaincy with a void is usually tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: on any lead but small @D at least 1 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to go wrong here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: 3@S a good tactical choice |pg||
nt|phil: yep|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: 7@D goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  especially since it does not clue partner in at all|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck:  3N could be in trouble with the @c break|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: which is why i suggested that W should give up chances of grand & settle for the practical way to reach 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: east afraid of his weak @S i guess|pg||

pc|s7|pg||

nt|skjaeran:  Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck:  e.g. a @s lead duck all around would probably beat 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 100 better than -180 but 140 is better|pg||

pc|sT|nt|blewah: yes, practical bid is a good one if you haven't discussed science with p|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|zebutin: yes i think on previous deal you easily can find 7 if you have that in cards, if you start with 3@H|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|psyck: Not sure what the redouble shows for them here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: system with 2@D as multi or MF could reach 6@H in east |pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  overall results (by groups) are to be found here http://www.tgrsbridge.com/|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in OR, E opened his hand and went down 2 in 2 @s, here E was more carefully|pg||
nt|kemperg: so far so good|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|bg: N could use 3 spades as minor suit interest but this pair may not have that in their system South would accept such a bid since a majority of his points are in the minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  particulary for this hand - very useful agreement|pg||
nt|bg: W needs a heart shift after two spades ducked|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|zebutin: or might try something that needs 14 cards on one opponent to work|pg||
nt|psyck: My counting is often limited to 1, 2, 3, many.|pg||
nt|bobholl: seeing 52 cards is always easier :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N SHOULD BE EASY|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|bobholl: poor n has to find a bid |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 nt would be my choice|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N perhaps?|pg||
nt|bobholl: same choice |pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s possible but unattractive on that suit|pg||
nt|phil: nice fit here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|danilo1: excellent by N ... he knew by the lead declarer max single @S ... to note - @SK would lead to 3NT made ... since than time for declarer to establish 3 @H tricks |pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C suffers from bad finesses|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c now|pg||
nt|zebutin: East did the disciplined thing by passing twice...i might have been tempted to bid 2@S at some point...sad to admit... :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass?????????|pg||
nt|bobholl: is that a suit ?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mathat: 3 nt and 5 1c only|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if you pass the S  hand which is defendable|pg||
nt|phil: wouldnt occur to me to open that South trash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt occur to me to pass at these colors:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would open but with an 11-13 NT :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bobholl: strange lead if P couldn't bid 1 @S |pg||
nt|henryb:  a strange lead given that partner could not make a negative double |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|henryb:  great commenters think alike|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Not the worst of slams, but should stop below the 6-level.|pg||
nt|mathat: 4 @c mb|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3C was forcing|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|blewah: i would have entered in the 2nd chance too, Seppo|pg||
nt|psyck: it is a good slam, should be bid both rooms|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N dicing with death|pg||
nt|bobholl: in @C only 4 :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 2 entries to the @D now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is betting as though his majors were  xx    Axxx|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|psyck:  good slam in fact, need little more than one of the fin working |pg||
nt|bobholl: should yes but will ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: again N refuses to bid 3N|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mathat: to pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: I thought South was endplayed into it|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  I'm told 2NT asked for aces.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: 3nt is so often superior to 5 of a minor and not only in pairs :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: @S lead and 1 down :(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: yes, several chances, none of which work here|pg||
nt|psyck: except @d lead :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E had no real reason to double 3S, which only gives more options to NS. on this auction W was already going to  lead a spade eevn with a void|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  By a reliable source|pg||
nt|granguru:  so 2@c must be a relay according @h|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|skjaeran:  3NT asked for cuebids|pg||
nt|bobholl: will try to ruff out @H Q and than @D finesse :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|granguru:  i would guess 2@d is a bal hand|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  3H=2 without Q|pg||
nt|granguru:  3n IS A NEW ASKING|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk on 5@D ... Sould shoud bid slam (or 5@S) ... already shown no slam interest before|pg||
nt|psyck: @h drop, @d fin, squeeze, all in vain|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pc|cA|nt|bobholl: guess this is a 70% slam or so|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|psyck:  with @hq & @cK known to be missing, N did not fancy the slam|pg||
pc|c3|nt|zebutin: if declarer would see all cards, might just try running the @D J|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|zebutin: would opponent really cover from Q9xx?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|zebutin: but ofc that is impossible line in real life, giving 0% chance instead of some good real chances|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry somewhat less |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
