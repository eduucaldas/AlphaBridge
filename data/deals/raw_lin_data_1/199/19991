nt|granguru:  plus only a @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: Hi svata Jacec and kibs|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: yes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: claim before playing 1st trick :-)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bg: rain here enjoy:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's special teams event, details to be found here http://www.tgrsbridge.com/ |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as far as I know, 3 group with 6 teams each are on their way|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: today we have 5 rounds (matches)|pg||
nt|bg:  S cashes 5 dia club ace and endplays W|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  RR in groups?|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  NS completed a team with decent Polish pair Gawrys-Kalita rapidly moving to the top of Polish bridge during last 2 seasons|pg||
nt|kjadams: a helpful lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the final of 1st TGR Auction teams|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@d gf stayman |pg||
nt|kemperg: Nice, transfer after 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are right Joao|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: a bit cloudy in London today |pg||
nt|jfaria:  could well be a transfer, just guessing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  with 4 loosers hard to guess a happy ending|pg||
nt|jfaria:  same result both rooms i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  even with a helpful lead, this is not an easy hand to play (or to make)|pg||
nt|baldjean: this 3nt will get into trouble. but it was logical to reach it|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodal f: may we still have the  "Skov - Rassmusen" as tone of tha pairs from norway? Sems as as some are better to know the people.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bg: good spot for first board s/b 110|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  and margin is 13 VP till 2nd placed team|pg||
nt|jfaria:  the T can be costy...|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I would play 2@c to show A@d rather than 10@c because of danger of discarding @d's|pg||
nt|jfaria:  must play a @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but they might have diffrent signals|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @S|pg||
nt|warrens:  the problem with playing high clubs from S is what to pitch from the dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  plain board for a start|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
nt|warrens:  he could pitch a @S and a @H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bg: good contract the old moysian fit:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  elimination play now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  though, without N's bid, EW may well land into 3NT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  comfortable standing|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bg: I guess systemically that N could not bid 3 spades over 3 hearts|pg||
nt|kjadams: Perfect fit here. |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s and @h|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bg: S playing for  a club honor onside this isnt going to work|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this start, S can rely on double finess in @c, but it doesn't work, unfortunately|pg||
nt|bg: W worried about possible but improbable 5 card trump stack may now switch to dia and let them ruff|pg||
nt|warrens:  now it should be clear for W to play a @S|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|vugraphznr: not sure what Artu's plan is now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like Greek gift|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Artur's|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but that' not the end|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|granguru:  not needed in fact|pg||
nt|granguru:  claim time|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|baldjean: @h continuation by E would have been better at trick 2|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  discarding 2 @d now is easy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bg: the spade 9 would control a heart return|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 rounds of @d could have following by 2 rounds of @c - just to become sure neither defernder has 5 spades|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all, bid and made - that matters|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  luckily. @s J is second|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  otherwise, finess is necessary now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: and @s was thrown away by N|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  and 4 more tricks for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Janet played 2-5-6 hearts showing no @d values but it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bg: but bidding 3 spades to me is better than a pass even if it showed 4 spades|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|nt|kjadams: tough guess here.  if D king off, then spade through would block the diamonds.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  the line of play looks reasonable|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kjadams: though this line essentially played for king in same hand.|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|psyck: wonder what 2N was for them|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently a raise of some kind looking at the 4@s rebid|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|psyck: going for some xruff maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: that may not work well if he loses 2@s, 1@h, 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, his best chance would be to get @d fin right|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|danilo1: 8 topp tricks ... but guess any lead by West will find ninth one (difficult to immagine @C lead)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hT|nt|skjaeran:  Still onluy 8 tricks.|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|psyck: hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not made (yet)|pg||
nt|psyck: not a great game with only 1 entry to dummy & not enough tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@H now is best|pg||
nt|psyck: would often go down even with @h fin on, & no chance here|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen really hit the best lead.|pg||
nt|psyck:  6 feet 9 inches|pg||
nt|psyck:  9.5|pg||
nt|granguru:  skov6.791338|pg||
nt|danilo1: y .. since North shown 4-card @H ... not easy lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|skjaeran:  Going down now.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|psyck:  That was Skov's height, 6' 9,5"...|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Yes, he's a BIG guy.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|danilo1: starting with @C is strange play .. if 3-3, no need to hurry|pg||
nt|psyck: if it not a bad game either, with several chances|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to  Seppo|pg||
pc|dK|nt|granguru:  6f 9.48i|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|skjaeran:  He could have made it by playing @DA @D after two clubs.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  took time for count 10, i suppose :) |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  present for a start for Wigoder |pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I'm impressed of Bulgarian play yesterday, they play edexcellent bridge|pg||
nt|warrens:  very strong result for N/S.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kemperg: Or areplaying board 39 and 40|pg||
nt|granguru:  if E had @cK10xx then he might have been in a problem|pg||
nt|granguru:  1@C precision, which is standard in Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: it is some modified Precision more similar to Polish Club  here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: no comparison now|pg||
nt|bg: 2nd hand should also be +110:)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|sfoxa:  they started from 39, indeed|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  looks like partscore battle, especially after W's bid|pg||
mb|r|nt|sfoxa:  @s game for NS, no more|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3@h would be too much at this vulnerabilty situation|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: only 2@h overcall gave NS some more space|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphznr: we playing 31 to 40 in this round|pg||
nt|granguru:  ok |pg||
mb|4D|nt|sfoxa:  nice bid opposite passed partner - NS are out of bidding|pg||
nt|bg: this should make lose 3 hearts dia and a spade|pg||
mb|6D|nt|sfoxa:  supposingly, 1@h bid was for spades|pg||
nt|kjadams: really aggressive 3N.   This is not going to do well.|pg||
nt|bg: NS destined to fail no matter where they end up|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@C is supposely Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: y|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, but I would rather not overcall 3@h with W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  20 to 20 points - Roland's favourite hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but now Janet may have trouble with bidding her hand, i suppose|pg||
nt|jfaria:  micro st by E|pg||
nt|jfaria:  stolling many @c contract to NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bg: oops a little GGRESSIVE|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm. not impossible|pg||
nt|bg: aggressive|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H is competitive|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  I'd like to know the reason not to bid @s with W hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: yes, it was transfer|pg||
nt|jfaria:  or even a @h game|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: current standings in final: 1. Esterson 74VP, 2. De Botton 58, 3. Naqvi 55 and 4. Widoger 53 VPs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, landed safely|pg||
nt|jfaria:  S woke up in time :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  I wonder, which card E chooses for return |pg||
pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  oh, I anticipated @c|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  yes, defenders have no chance to @c trick |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C start needed|pg||
nt|kjadams: seems that with misfit, going low can win, and 2H likely to make.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|nt|bg: I agree 2 H by N enough if South has a bigger Michaels then he will bid again|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kjadams: Good partner returning my suit!|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bg: E doesnt know that N has only one spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but @s switch seems to be safe|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after @s discard from dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bg: good switch now we will see if EW on same wavelenght as to count|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  admit, this time the lay of the cards isn't pretty good for EW, but playing 2@s seems good|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bg: W duck one dia continue club Q no play|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
mc|13|pg||
qx|c14|st||md|4ST83H65DK9832CQ53,SQJ542HQ9873DJ6C8,SAK9HDAQT74CAKJ74,S76HAKJT42D5CT962|sv|o|nt|granguru:  here we see a typical hand where 3 hands are distributional and the 4th doest know about it|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently he did try the x ruff & went down as suspected|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on 6@H good save|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|zebutin: mighty try even 7@D|pg||
mb|4D|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: the correct side will start bidding @d soon :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|5H|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
mb|6D|mb|6H|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
mb|7D|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
mb|7H|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|c3|nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: lead was easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: NV, may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|hJ|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|d7|pg||
nt|granguru:  claim time already|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|psyck: Even with @d fin, @s will never produce trick, so may as ewll have discarded @d on @sA|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  to concede 1 club at the end|pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start seemed clear|pg||
nt|bg: well played down one good result  other than stopping in 2 hearts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  not obvious line at the table|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|kemperg: any grand is on for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  huge hand for EW|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S's tiny opening allows EW staying low, I hope|pg||
nt|kemperg: but 6 is normal bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but they have to discover their might|pg||
nt|kemperg: Very distracting to hear Roland talking:):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: this looks like a normal 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: modern bidding by EW, 2@D as switch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now 4@s bid looks like obligatory|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S had been @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W should find reasons to continue the bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: how do you find @SK is missing?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  no way - it seems|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kjadams: Open room North bid 3S directly on bd 21|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|kemperg: N on the brink of an invite|pg||
nt|kemperg: I couldn't|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - grand relied of a finess of trump K - isn't the good one|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl lokking for a better suit then @H?|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@d inv minors|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  or the team match pressure worked? it seems so|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @S finesse now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after this lead he will play spades from top|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and after this start, @sK is going to take the trick - declarer may be afraid of @d ruff|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  2NT sotppers in @H and @s|pg||
nt|barbyh: hello Barbara from Las Vegas|pg||
nt|baldjean: hi Barbara|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: hello|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bg: then S misplayed only made 5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bg: good decision by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hot start|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H competitive, dbl = invite|pg||
nt|barbyh: solid contract|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bg: aggressive E might have been better off trying 2 dia instead of 2 hearts showing 10 points or so sure spade support is weak but the alternative of 2 Hearts led them too high|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  with this lead, even 2 tricks in @s for NS become problematic|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree - distribution encourages|pg||
nt|jfaria:  N just does not believe...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  yes, W could be hardly blamed for his 3@h bid - E may well have an ace more|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  EW have easy 3NT, but this juicy defence brings more |pg||
nt|baldjean: if N does not continue Q@h it will be 12 tricks even|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|bg: E should balance I think usually bad result to let opps play 1h-2h|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphznr: what would be 3@d instead of 3@h ? isnt like better /weak support with heart fit ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this agreement suits well to the situation|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and a lot of pairs playing opps suit as maximum (passed or bid) hand with fit|pg||

mb|1S|nt|granguru:  a small @c first improuves a little defense options|pg||
nt|Walddk2: San Marino is a state situated on the Italian peninsula on the eastern side of the Apennine Mountains. It is an enclave surrounded by Italy. Its size is just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with an estimated population of over 30,000. Its capital is the City of San Marino. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: raptor would be pretty to have in W |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: BRAVE 1 NT BY e|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: P cud be yarborough|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: some like sandwich NT (for other suits) & some like nat NT (since opps often open & respond light & steal you blind)...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland has the 'R' convention closely trailing the F & G conventions in the list of avoidable ones|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: @S guess solved now so will make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: 2@S transfer and 2nt acceptance|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sunsamvar: true CK but still a brave bid at unfav vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: playing NT as nat in that position, I would also bid 1NT|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|psyck:  I play 1@s by E as 4+ cards & x with less|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now making as crucial entry got|pg||
pc|s5|nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: now Bogdan Marina is missing :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: he'll be back shortly|pg||
nt|kemperg: on 33 mor problems for EW.|pg||
nt|kemperg: W bid 2 @D ( no switch an after 4 @C 4 @S end|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: back|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  end is good - everything's good|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  opne room started with  9 - so we have first comparison|pg||
nt|jfaria:  I think W forgot about colours...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bg: Board one S had easy 3 nt with spade lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|granguru:  2@s weak 3@c competittive, NF, no 4@H probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  4@s seems to be good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  oh - no need even|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: do you agree with S pass after 2@s?|pg||
nt|jfaria:  probably thet are playing variable nt or a strong believe not to open 1nt with 5 c M|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5 imps for defending in both rooms.|pg||
nt|granguru:  e shows cards not  penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: correct|pg||
nt|baldjean: this can make 6@h|pg||
nt|baldjean: but will they get there?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  hard to say|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS may win 6@c on @s guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5@c seems safe|pg||
nt|bg: have to be careful in heart slam a finesse would be fatal|pg||
nt|granguru:  Now sputh must think W has no 4@H, 5+@c some @s for the pass.--most problabe hand after this lead is 3-3-1-6|pg||
nt|granguru:  without @HAK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sfoxa:  with N as declarer, contract is safe|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  same for 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|baldjean: not easy to make though|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: this sequence shows medium slamish interest I guess|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, and W is probably worried about the @d now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: not sure about their agreement but 2nt should show some !@d values - he could have bid 2@s as 4th suit, W has nice hand to make one more step in may opinion|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, I agree. I would take that additional step too|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 2@d as 4th suit|pg||
nt|barbyh: does he know partner has a stiff club?|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I doubt|pg||
nt|barbyh: then that may be of concern|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sfoxa:  what would you lead with W hand after such an auction?|pg||
nt|kemperg: W almost endplayed now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kemperg: @C for me|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @s for me - both of no use this time|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d looks as the same pain|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4 diamonds, 4 hearts, 1 club 1 spade..  Needs two club ruffs, but the overruff is a problem.|pg||
nt|baldjean: probably not, but that's what an additional bid can find out. 4@s to show short @s|pg||
nt|barbyh: would be much easier to bid knowing that|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kjadams: Interesting rules question.   we all could see that 1S was down only 3 on previous board, but in Bridge, the Kibitzers can't tell the players, so if the players score it as down 4, ...|pg||
nt|kjadams: so be it.|pg||
nt|kjadams: they have to catch it themselves..|pg||
nt|rodal f: ate to see some who might well will play some good bridge for England.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kemperg: no, dnl for me|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: btw 2@s was a good decision, may would bid simply 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: many*|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sfoxa:  @s game looks not worse, actually|pg||
nt|kemperg: same start in OR, but S rebid 2 @S , @D was not mentioned|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: here 2@s would be 6+@s, thats what N explained|pg||
nt|granguru:  so most probable @SKxx @Ha(Q)x @Dx @cA(q)xxxx|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kjadams: we can see that Rabbi's rule works (when the stiff king offside, Drop it), but at the table, I'd probably go down.|pg||
nt|warrens:  what was the purpose of 2@D?|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Hate to see|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jfaria:  12 imps gain on B2, again as expected|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, i see, checkback for @H's|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kjadams: Let's say he starts with ace and a club...  after the over ruff, still has to guess hearts.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  and this line may well reduce declarer's tricks with 9 only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E may clear @d now|pg||
nt|bg: this line guards against a heart switch but turns out ok since W has club ace|pg||
nt|bg: right if he drops king then slam makes|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks very straightforward|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's good bid opposite passed partner - when no game is in view|pg||
nt|granguru:  defese tires to reduce @C ruffs power by leading  trum now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bg: N should bid 4 clubs show that he has a few clubs he has already shown three hearts anywat they stopped in right spot|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this game seems better than 4@h |pg||
nt|kjadams: Momentary nervousnous about missing slam with turn to rejoice when he sees splits.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|granguru:  tries|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2@s I mean|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  communication problems are closer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  I'll never know, why one is sure about @cA in this postion|pg||
nt|kemperg: are they playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to guess @c now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  cunningly done|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: no defense left|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|jfaria:  lots of tricks now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first lead was good, but this spade continuation - just splendid|pg||
nt|warrens:  making at least 5, possibly 6 on a @C @D squeeze|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  another way possible - now W waits with @d and @cQ|pg||
mc|11|nt|bg: yes 4 hearts depends on club guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: more simply establish a @s|pg||
nt|kemperg: @SJ and W is in trouble|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now he can throw @d and next?|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H finesse is needed any how, do that now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @h is communication line, should be kept|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but battle till the end|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  maybe, something happens|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|psyck:  need more than that|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I may have preferred some number of @c instead of the negative 1@d on the Strong @c opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck:  you have 3 @c's in hand to take care of|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Ruff two of them. You need @Ds to behave too.|pg||

nt|danilo1: logical decision by East ... @S shorthness is not encouraging|pg||

nt|bobholl: not a convincing bidding but it works :)|pg||

pc|h4|pg||

nt|granguru:  5@c fortunatelly is one down|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sfoxa:  I wonder, if N's 2nt bid will promis minors in this situation|pg||
nt|bg: ok I understand the players can toss cards for the last few tricks faster than any operator can key them in|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  but 4@H isnt!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kjadams: Though bridge is a game of skill, Slam luck can turn a match, and the de Botton team was most unfortunate to lose on that board.   If slam makes, its win 11 instead of lose 11.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  nevertheless - 8 easy tricks for NS|pg||
nt|bg: 120 or 130 S passes gets the 120|pg||

mb|p|nt|bg: good S should respect N decision not to accept any higher aspirations|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  he smiles in face of any result )))|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S 10 ditribution or @H signal?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to bid with W hand - suit is very weak|pg||

nt|baldjean: oh yes,sorry. miscalculated|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jfaria:  N usually plays the TENS in p lead :)|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  4 boards - 4 two-digit swing, yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kjadams: 6 tricks in,  can try for 2 clubs and a diamond, or try to set up heart.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  and this one may appear not a push, too|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  but the matter of course may well be repeated next door|pg||

nt|barbyh: srry|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  just hoping for statistics|pg||
nt|kemperg: both majors?|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: y|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting variation|pg||
nt|kemperg: also a strong in it , good|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|sfoxa:  unlucky (but seemingly obvious) game in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I think  the best line was to endplay W, playing AK @h and K@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, and one more point - one should know, how the partner reacts on such things|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: in previous|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Really playing variable Nt (EW)|pg||
nt|bg: another tough distribution hand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|nt|vugraphznr: oh, you written that :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  even bad trump break doesn't prevent EW from 8 tricks |pg||
nt|kjadams: 4S likely contract will go down on bad splits.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: N unhappy right now  smiles will come in a few minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and in this board, S is a wizzard. all 3 key cards (@dA, @hK and @sQ) are wrong placed|pg||
nt|warrens:  anyone else for 1NT?  I bid 2@H  with that hand.  seems much more suit oriented|pg||
pc|sA|nt|baldjean: 4@h can be made here because 10@h drops on second @h trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  supposing, E doesn't start with trumps|pg||
nt|bg: I guess the S stands for Sylvia:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  )))|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  carefull defence is necessary to beat it|pg||
nt|jfaria:  x from E fit showing?|pg||
nt|kjadams: I like 2H.|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 2@h  for me|pg||
nt|barbyh: well how does he know the king isnt dropping on the second trick?|pg||
nt|baldjean: 3nt makes too though|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bg: provided E gets dia right|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, not a @h lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: friendly lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  7 tricks from top|pg||
nt|granguru:  needing to promote 2 more|pg||
nt|granguru:  chances: @H finesse and @H 3-3 |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  main point - to believe in it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: is it a 55 at least? I dont understand the 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: it was explained as 55 but if 54 then 5@s and 4@h|pg||
nt|bg: dia king now should ask for heart qwitch|pg||
nt|bg: switch|pg||
nt|kjadams: DQ would.  Some play King just shows Q.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kemperg: to late now|pg||
nt|barbyh: fine lead for defense|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  yes, one more challenge for E|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but 55 in principle|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK ty now itys clearto me|pg||
nt|kemperg: typing almost as bad as my chipps at golf to day:(|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C start was needed|pg||
nt|bg: good partnership understanding here most pairs would not have 3 clubs in their system to show the S hand|pg||
nt|bg: good point|pg||
nt|granguru:  @H finesse and @D |pg||
nt|granguru:  @d 3-3|pg||
nt|granguru:  d@D 4-2 with Hx falling|pg||
nt|granguru:  @d QJ onside|pg||
nt|granguru:  @S QJ alone|pg||
nt|granguru:  and a red trick|pg||
nt|granguru:  so best is to attack @D|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now if E ducks W has no easy exit|pg||
nt|granguru:  E must overtake and repeat|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|kemperg: wont have E in|pg||
nt|granguru:  asked@S with @C9|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: he should play 6@c as neutral card|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: I guess|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: x was explained as extras, probably @s support|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphznr: now Nick knows N has A@d and K@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: S would continue spades otherwise|pg||
nt|rodal f: Must admit that I was wrong. By bridge we alway shall lowe eack other and acsept as all. Sorrt. I failed a lot|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphznr: but spade switch is still dangerous for declarer|pg||
nt|granguru:  e asked @s not to promote @s trcks but to cut communications to dummmy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jfaria:  thx Jacek|pg||
nt|kjadams: tough hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like reasonable save. may be a push, all in all?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|kemperg: try @S , 9 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru:  trying to protect his @H tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barbyh: well he played for it what else can be done|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h9|nt|bg: any line now leads to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jfaria:  the point for nonexperts: after a nt opening, a transfer from p , x cant be punishing :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: It's been 25 yearts since I have played 4 card majors, but we would bid our lowest 4 card suit.  Interesting the major despite 4 diamonds.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer considered the @D splitting a real card|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  N's remaining trumps are too small, yes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|granguru:  but played a losing safety play now|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: there was interesting situation: N played form hand instead from dummy and E covered so play continued|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  finess and pray|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: well played|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, mixed raises become popular|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphznr: sry, they p;layed so fats that have to claim now:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphznr: fast|pg||
nt|granguru:  @H finesse by force|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|granguru:  but it add up to 8 ..|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|kjadams: ruffing clubs will score low trumps and allow a trump Coup position|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bg: N may finesse spade now has 9 tricks and why would W take so long to throw a spade|pg||
nt|granguru:  6 ...7 |pg||

nt|zebutin: 4@S for NS, and save in minor for EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: this is cheaper :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, 1@h double a good idea at the vul & with passed hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|zebutin: yes...i must admit i couldn't have passed with Wests hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  4@h looks like a better contract than 3NT.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck:  4@h could make even if you get trumps wrong|pg||
nt|bobholl: only objection against double is only 3 @S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|skjaeran:  Can discard a spade on clubs.|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 3@D would be forcing, ! would choose 3@D rather than jump to 3NT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: 2@h must have shown an intermediate hand with 5@h & W was not interested in game opp less than strong @c opening values|pg||
nt|zebutin: and some might even bid with Easts hand something like balancing 1nt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: I can understand E not bidding as he expects vul opps to be in a misfit as pd did not x 1@h|pg||

nt|kemperg: good save, but OR in 2@S|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but they have 4 more boards|pg||
nt|kjadams: must have unblocked clubs earlier then.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|warrens:  wasn't it down 1? 2 @S's, 2@D and 2@H's?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  kind of weird hand. let's see how they cope with it|pg||
nt|kjadams: Rather unusual to have something interesting on every board.  Exciting match.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kemperg: all pass|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D again?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  if S dares|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: he've just had a pass in his hand but put it back :-)|pg||
nt|kemperg: IN  OR 1@C and also @H start:(|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: other table Pepsi won 3nt in previous|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  @h start seems reasonable,  but makes declarer's life easier|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Jacek Pszczola I mean :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: easy one down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bg: S may not be able to find 9 th trick but then opps can get tangled up:)|pg||

pc|h8|nt|sfoxa:  as for me, I'm afraid of pre-empring with side suit AK|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  any green beginner will catch the trick|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: but one down :/|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  but only @s lead works|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think that with V nt 1@c couls show @d, explaining N initial pass, but just guessing|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S needed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quit a hard 6@C|pg||
nt|barbyh: very|pg||

nt|danilo1: East hand on limit to make slam try in @C ... and West's one on limit to accept it ... together - slam danger |pg||
nt|granguru:  3@D is a slam invitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: if 3@D is transfer  worth 4@H ?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|blewah: thanks, Krishna|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  thats why W is considering ..|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@H positive response|pg||
nt|granguru:  probably in 1 minor|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  EW is not a regular partnership. Hope they know what they're doing now.|pg||
nt|granguru:  not known|pg||
nt|psyck:  Other room E knew pd had 4 carder @h with likely some wastage, after kickback revealed an ace missing, maybe should stop in game with min hand|pg||

pc|c3|nt|granguru:  4@H no @d control|pg||
nt|granguru:  only a @d lead permits to win|pg||

nt|zebutin: now little easier, but if they drive @S A down, you must feel little uneasy that @C finese isn't actually working|pg||
nt|zebutin: even if it works for the 1st time you take it that is|pg||
pc|h7|nt|granguru:  made!|pg||
nt|danilo1: not sure if they had this option (lot of partnerships use it) - but if possible, better would be to transfer in @C and show slam try with @H single/void ... West would than ...|pg||

mb|3D!|an|weak 4!d|nt|warrens:  maybe 2@D now, followed by 3@H?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kjadams: Many pairs play transfer advances of partners major after a negative double.  |pg||
mb|4H|nt|kjadams: where transfer to opps suit = limit raise|pg||
nt|warrens:  or even followed by 2N here|pg||
nt|warrens:  i admit, i didn't expect 2@S|pg||
nt|granguru:  a tough response now|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: other table 4hxx ... in prev , now playing|pg||

mb|5D|nt|kemperg: do the Romanians have Bulgarian?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS are from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeh, but their opps not|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: hmmm|pg||
nt|granguru:  2NT conventional|pg||
mb|p!|an|1 or 4 aces|nt|sfoxa:  from one hand, 5@d is a good save, from another - you may well force your opps to go higher|pg||
nt|kjadams: transfer to our suit = constructive raise, and bidding our suit is garbage.|pg||
nt|bg: not sure what 2 H meant|pg||
nt|kjadams: let's hope they do not both try double moysian spade fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: now they are on their way|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 1 down at least|pg||
mb|6H|nt|sfoxa:  Herman team got hard stroke in  1, when EW next door bid and went down in 3NT, but now, imp by imp, they gain the lead|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2H should be a last train type of game try in case 2D stronger than limit.|pg||
nt|granguru:  E didnt transfered with such a strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  after @dQ falls, only @h finess is necessary|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  obvious 3NT, but after informative bidding|pg||

nt|blewah: slam time|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psyck: NS will go down in some contract here i suppose|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobholl: 6@H in east is the optimum contract :)|pg||
nt|blewah: both pairs play big club|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psyck: luckily not possible to misguess @s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chrisky: 6NT also....|pg||
nt|blewah: exclusion rkcb now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@D voidwood would be pretty now |pg||
nt|blewah: 5@d|pg||
nt|blewah: or yes 4@d, depending on their agreement|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 4@H no aces and the optimum contract in the best hand :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|blewah: 2@h is normal, slower road|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|vugraphznq: on TGRs behalf I'd like to thank... ROLAND (for being helpful and supporting)@H@H@H... ALL COMMENTATORS (for making this event more interesting)@H@H@H Thank you all for your time ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: anyone for 2@C NV vs. voul |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 in hand is the threat but in that case Nwould have played @SK to kill the squeeze|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not me|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: may be i direct 4/5 @D would agree @S :(|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|blewah: yes, that would be the intention too|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|blewah: W just wanted to knoe keycards in @s excluding in @d|pg||
mc|12|nt|blewah: *know|pg||
nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||

nt|vugraphznr: Bessis team was sold on auction for 3800 GBP|pg||
nt|kjadams: a chance to tighten the match there.|pg||
nt|warrens:  whoops, 7@H's?!|pg||
nt|warrens:  may only lose 3 to 6@H's -1 at this table|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  good fits - no game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jfaria:  now @h vs @s duel 4 sure|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bg: another not unreasonable slam that will fail on distribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  when everything fails the cieling goes down on you|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sfoxa:  is it the top amount?|pg||
nt|bg: I can imagine  spade break un lucky but no need to cash spade king|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: and this was the top amount|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and how does the standing look like, actually?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, EW prevented opps from @h game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tiny, but game|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kemperg: lead of @C 9 what was the system on that?|pg||
nt|kemperg: all pass|pg||
nt|warrens:  though finding out you're off an ace and the Q of trumps should keep them out of  6|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: agressive 1nt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznr: 2@c Precision style|pg||
nt|kjadams: There is an advanced convention that helps avoid grand slams off a cashing Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  EW next door manage to bid this slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what about this pair?|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont see the 1 up|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ok @S at W but goog enough?|pg||
nt|baldjean: no game in sight for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  and vul. sacrifice that works |pg||

nt|warrens:  omg|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kemperg: vuln. save:)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  but this time he guessed ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: good board for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d start is necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: after @s lead 5@h should make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting choice|pg||
nt|rodal f: *good|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  with the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: Gustawsson was sold for 500|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but impossible|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bg: do not like 2nt rebid 2 dia reverse then raise hearts better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  only when defence goes asleep|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 2@s was corrected to 3|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: so should jump a@s|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: overall pool money are 22.500 gbp|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  kind of gadget could be usefull for EW, showing 6 cards suit and not minimum hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: lost of comment by specs, nice:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots:(|pg||
nt|kemperg: S had a pass on 2 @D so N knows they are high enough|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kjadams: oh my|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: very lucky slam at other table|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  and cash @d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I meant 3NT by S - rather demonstrating @s stopper|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Skov is a lovly lad by 203 and got his nick name "Superbaby" by his nice behaviour.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S of W said if you have @H then bid else pass|pg||
pc|cK|nt|granguru:  2@d was Multi|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  looks like NS are on their way to @c  slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  grand???|pg||
nt|bg: now they cannot know about club queen they may bid 7 and get lucky|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky indeed - no possibility to get wrong|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphznr: 1. Gustawsson - 3800, 2. Ventin - 3500 3. Herman - 2400 |pg||
nt|vugraphznr: 4. Widoger - 2100, 5. De Botton - 1600, 6. Garvey - 1400|pg||
nt|kjadams: should lose 1S 1D.  next.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: there are many imps in this round in both ways|pg||
nt|kemperg: @SK now?|pg||
nt|kemperg: entrys are a big problem here|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont see more then 8 tricks max.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  each line of play choosen by declarer, leads to one down, unfortunately |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if defence makes no mistake|pg||
nt|bg: this will tighten up the match|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit sad to see the bid.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|granguru:  2@S was longer @S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphznr: sry first one was Bessis of course :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznr: for 3800|pg||
nt|warrens:  missed a great slam, but not making|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|zebutin: would be sad to bid 6@H after 4/5@D and see partner change it to 6@S...|pg||
nt|blewah: ow, that would be sad|pg||
nt|psyck: he should have set suit with 3@h on 2@d as suggested, then had enough options|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: bit strong for a NV 2@H isn't it ?|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|blewah: setting up @h suit and assume captaincy with a void is usually tricky|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|blewah: yes, practical bid is a good one if you haven't discussed science with p|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|psyck: after 2@d-3@h-3@s cue- he still has option of exclusion key card ask of 5@d|pg||

pc|d3|pc|s2|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||

pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes i think on previous deal you easily can find 7 if you have that in cards, if you start with 3@H|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|c3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||

nt|blewah: 2@h here is pretty normal, i think but i don't know about W's pass|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psyck: Not sure what the redouble shows for them here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: system with 2@D as multi or MF could reach 6@H in east |pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|blewah: i usually play wide range of overcall|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|hT|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|kemperg: so far so good|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|bg: N could use 3 spades as minor suit interest but this pair may not have that in their system South would accept such a bid since a majority of his points are in the minors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  particulary for this hand - very useful agreement|pg||
nt|bg: W needs a heart shift after two spades ducked|pg||
