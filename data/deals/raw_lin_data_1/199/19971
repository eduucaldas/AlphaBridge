nt|psyck: good start for dec, he now has 6 tricks as cards are & opps likely to give 7th|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: will likely end with 3@s, 3@c, 1@d|pg||
nt|athene: south certainly can't avoid getting endplayed in the red suits|pg||
nt|psyck: dec will not touch @d on this bidding & S can be endplayed in @h|pg||

nt|psyck: *now|pg||
nt|athene: i can't believe she is thinking this long? - cash heart must be right, declarer can't have four hearts for the 1nt bid|pg||
nt|athene: cash heart, cash @DK if you want to see for sure, then just exit club, wait for @DKJ|pg||
nt|psyck: if dec has 3@d & 4@c, cashing @hq will still work|pg||

pc|c4|pg||

nt|kerasidis: 6 top tricks|pg||
nt|kerasidis: lets see where he can find 2 more|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|athene: declarer wants time to get trumps drawn so she can run the spades and throw three clubs from dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||

nt|kerasidis: first swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: marsonis likes his hand with 10 and 2 aces|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: will Sabine balance 2@S? she can't really; west still unlimited|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: i suppose you might consider 3@D as you are in the pre-balancing seat, but you think partner has four spades, so maybe there is not so much reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: oh hmmm ok i was assuming it would go 1@S 2@S there|pg||

nt|psyck: however they land right |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: Sabine really played the king?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Auken did not play the king unless the queen was played from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if that is because she thought declarer would definitely rise queen with Ax in her hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kerasidis: i dont see why but....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Bridge is too difficult for me if I am to assume that partner has underled an ace|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@hwelcome Roland|pg||
nt|athene: so she thought ok, declarer has the jack and partner underled the ace|pg||
nt|chrisky: hi Roland|pg||
nt|athene: in which case, she will be sadder and wiser now |pg||
nt|bmkl: trying the cross ruff way |pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: only reason for it one can think of anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer needs to ruff all @H to make the contract|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: so if they play against someone very inexperienced, they can look a bit silly on occasion|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: awkward for EW to get their hands on 4@C in the other room|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: west could have balanced with 1@S or 1NT - if she doubles, she has to bid 1NT over 1@H, i think|pg||

nt|granguru:  any distribution|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|granguru:  N has to swallow a pretty strong hand|pg||

pc|sA|nt|athene: and since no-one plays penalty doubles any more.... :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: north should be doubling clubs for takeout|pg||

pc|s2|nt|psyck: 1N would have been my choice assuming 11-15|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||

nt|eleni: another swing|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west should have doubled 4@C in the other room but it's not really obvious|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: for a start it's not obvious exactly what it means :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  well if you were short of opps suit the first time it is hard to have lenght the next round of the same hand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: east balances this with a gentle 2@H, and now Sabine can double for takeout, maybe|pg||
nt|eleni: we have all met Spyros Maglaras, our usual operator:) well time to see him in bridge action too:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: i wouldn't want to pass 2@H with the south hand - it's just too likely it gets passed out, which will almost always be bad|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6N|nt|athene: ok, Martens is right there|pg||
nt|granguru:  well if he does here as well as an operator he should win easily|pg||
nt|athene: obviously a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: martens said sorry after the lead|pg||
nt|eleni: -3 will be a good score for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  1@s was 11+ 5+ @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  unlimited strenght|pg||
nt|granguru:  N will probably go down here|pg||
nt|granguru:  looks that if he founds the @dq can squeeze W|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: there is a danger east might get endplayed in hearts/clubs|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i cant understand this auction|pg||
pc|d4|nt|granguru:  but if he fails he will be -2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|psyck: he will not be sorry once he sees thy score only -150 instead of a lot more they lose in @h contract|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: one of those situations that a new partnership are going to have trouble with|pg||
nt|granguru:  EW are near 6@H|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: yes, balancing 2@H is just such a good idea at MP that even when you have a misunderstanding it's not so bad|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: fantoni didn't cash his @DA because he wanted west to win a diamond and play a heart|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru:  now W will be endplayed |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|granguru:  so any number of down cant be so bad|pg||
nt|granguru:  has only 3 discards|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h8|nt|granguru:  started with the most critical suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: as well as "double is always takeout" it's good to play "2nt is never natural" :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: it wasn't strictly necessary as the cards lie - east could, for example, give a ruff-and-discard when in with the @SK, and it wouldn't cost - but this is sensible defence anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h3|nt|granguru:  best is to let @CK alone|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|granguru:  great mistake by Delle cave now|pg||
nt|granguru:  he should have thought this situation long before|pg||
nt|blewah: test|pg||
nt|granguru:  gave away everything|pg||
nt|blewah: hi John, Eleni|pg||
nt|granguru:  hand is made  ow|pg||
nt|granguru:  now|pg||
nt|kerasidis: claim time|pg||
pc|s9|nt|granguru:  I said almost 6...only 5 because N overuffs the @S |pg||
pc|d3|nt|eleni: the moment of truth :)|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might run this, in which case east gets the ruff too|pg||
nt|warrens:  west could never fool declarer.  if he never pitches a spade, declarer cashes out.  if he does pitch one, he gets endplayed or the club drops|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|eleni: good decision by Nick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: looking at it from EW's point of view, this is why you simply can't let people get away with non-vul sacrifices undoubled|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if you can make anything, you never get enough in 50s|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
mc|12|nt|kerasidis: a more expirienced pair would find 7 @s|pg||

nt|athene: it's so rare that 2nt will be your best spot|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kerasidis: interesting board|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|kerasidis: can be very bloody|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting - many would not use a support double there, as 1@S promises five|pg||
nt|granguru:  use them as lebensohl or mouse or rubensohl or some adjunct or whatever...|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe NS play it doesn't, or maybe they think it's still useful to differentiate between 3- and 4-card support |pg||
nt|psyck: some play 1@s as 4+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 1@S only shows 4+ for that pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We don't know their agreement|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: wrong couple sat on the table so the board will be canceled?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: let's start and see|pg||
nt|athene: they shouldn't be sitting on the table at all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sitting on the table is really not nice no matter what|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: yes 60/60 |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|granguru:  pity for declarer that @S8 is not in his hand|pg||
nt|granguru:  another @S will establish the @SJ if taken, but also potencially promoting a @s for the defense |pg||
nt|granguru:  up to now we can count 2@c 2@S 2@d 2@h|pg||
nt|blewah: hmm made now after that @s?|pg||
nt|loe48: can make if do wrong|pg||
nt|blewah: small @c back is not easy to find|pg||
nt|blewah: Spec suggests @s2 was suit preference for @c|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|granguru:  ducking imporuves a little declarer position as the suit became freezed now |pg||
nt|mathat: now x@h to K and x @H|pg||
nt|athene: declarer lacks the entries to bring in spades, but he doesn't know whether they are 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: that is one advantage for the defence of ducking the second spade|pg||
nt|athene: if they won the ace and shifted, declarer could keep the spades in reserve|pg||
nt|granguru:  declarer knows @s position perfectly well|pg||
nt|athene: but now, if he wants to take advantage of a 3-3 break he has to risk setting up another trick for the defence|pg||
nt|granguru:  because W threw @S7 instead of the @S6|pg||
nt|granguru:  fantoni couldnt know W @s cards when he started playing 9 and 10|pg||
nt|mathat: ansd cave 2@s first|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's true|pg||
nt|granguru:  fantoni plays usually SLAVINSKY leads and udca in middle game|pg||
nt|athene: @S7 was a better card then|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|dT|nt|athene: sorry @S6 was better|pg||
nt|athene: because fantoni would be able to drop the big ones if he had the 7|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|granguru:  anyhow these are honest players..so the very long thought on taking or not with the @SA gives declarer a picture of what is happening|pg||
nt|athene: east can't afford a red card, but declarer is short of entries to use a long club of course|pg||
pc|c4|nt|granguru:  Fulvio is having trouble keeping stoppers in 3 suits|pg||
nt|blewah: there goes 1 @s winner|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mathat: now -1|pg||
nt|mathat: @c|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Manos and everyone|pg||
nt|athene: can still make|pg||
nt|athene: it's really a cute position though i think|pg||
nt|mathat: hi andy|pg||
nt|athene: let's say east exits a club|pg||
nt|athene: and west does NOT unblock|pg||
nt|granguru:  @c looks best because you see stiff @CA|pg||
nt|granguru:  but is it really?|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can cash @HAK and throw west in with a spade|pg||
nt|granguru:  a complex position|pg||
nt|athene: west cashes @SA, @Ck but then must lead into the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: now|pg||
nt|granguru:  as you see Fulvio is taking his time|pg||
nt|athene: if west DOES unblock the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: instead declarer can throw east in with the club!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: and make him lead into the hearts|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eleni: @hwelcome Andy|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Eleni@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice play by W|pg||
nt|athene: right now @DAK, small heart and duck when east splits|pg||
nt|athene: IF you read the cards|pg||
nt|athene: sorry @HK first|pg||
nt|andyv:  easy for us to see here...much tougher at table|pg||
nt|granguru:  a good play ..W doesnt want to be triple squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: well, declarer knows the black suit layout doesn't he|pg||
nt|granguru:  he transfered the @c responsability to his partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok, as specs are pointing out, east can't lead a diamond of course either|pg||
nt|athene: so you don't need to cash the @DAK to strip his cards there|pg||
nt|granguru:  to keep @s and @d|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: he was down the way the play was given|pg||
mb|1N|nt|granguru:  2@D regular transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3N in practice|pg||
nt|granguru:  3NT seems to be the prefered one|pg||
nt|chrisky: no 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt on a heart lead - what's the best play in diamonds?|pg||
nt|granguru:  e should bid NT now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even when playing 2/1 you need an agreement as to whether you can reverse with a minimum|pg||
nt|chrisky: and 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: did he get it right?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|granguru:  3@H asks stopper 3@s none|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: Last board of this segment. 2 more to follow today and tomorrow broadcast starts 2 hours earlier:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|granguru:  @DAKQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  a little better than finessing|pg||
nt|psyck: low to T is % in @d|pg||
nt|athene: finesse the @D10 is best for 5 tricks and best for max expectation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The world is divided. Does 2@S show extra values or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 42% according to suitplay.exe|pg||
nt|athene: according to my big, boring, dusty tome of suit combinations|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Apparently not for EW here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|psyck: for 5 tricks, & 93% for 4|pg||
nt|granguru:  here W opened a 1NT with 54 in the minors|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@s must have be sound in NS system, looking at that 3@h by N|pg||
nt|granguru:  NS had 3@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  N probably tried to avoid Fantoni from retransfering|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i would bid again after 2@h|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|granguru:  North was asking if 2@s was a good hand or not I am told|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: but here of course there is the little matter of getting to dummy enough times|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: entries to be considered though|pg||
nt|athene: you don't know spades are 3-3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: (or @S10 coming down) so must be better to play diamonds from the top|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|mathat: sam e lead|pg||
nt|mathat: in other room|pg||
nt|granguru:  need some guesses..mainly in trump suit|pg||
nt|athene: no-one likes to go down at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: so unless it's hugely the best odds play, no finesse!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|blewah: Fantoni could have doubled 3@h. This 4@h has some stretch inside I think|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|athene: you have to decide:- set up clubs, set up diamonds, or crossruff?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: yes, from top best with only 1 sure entry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: crossruff looks reasonable to me|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzjf: a really bad score for N-S|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s does not show extras as i play it, but there are different styles there|pg||
nt|athene: maybe South decided that her partner ought to rise with @CK to clear hearts|pg||

nt|granguru:  good lead by Dionysopoulos we must say|pg||
