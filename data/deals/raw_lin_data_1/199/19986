nt|ahollan1: i'm really only confident of opening bid and response|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, that's what being stated in their CC. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at other tables  East will open 1@H  warning South of the dangers|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if vP's DBL absolutely confirms a canape   4@S 5+@H   and that must be why Verhees thinking|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: What do 3@H mean now?|pg||
nt|athene: obviously south intends it as a strong spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you pass lots and then bid opps' suit it is natural, but not usually in a major, that promised five cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u|pg||
nt|athene: might have been easier if north had bid 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that wasn't natural for them|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S over 1@S was natural then the delayed 2@S is weaker i suppose in which case he has a super-max hand and must surely bid game now|pg||
nt|athene: probably he should bid game anyway :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: When I was younger than now I loved to follow NS as players, They are god vine.|pg||
nt|twcho: so 3@h is probably another relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fantoni will just keep asking for more information artificially|pg||
nt|twcho: thus unbal promised shortness somewhere?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it could also be 6(322)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BBO only shows 1 of the 4 matches each round|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do W have press here? Agree u at the 3@HX as end.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: and will NOT have 4+ other major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is a Chinese site that sometimes shows a different match, but not right now|pg||

nt|twcho: do they play turbo?|pg||
