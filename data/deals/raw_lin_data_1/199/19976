nt|athene: many specs are saying south should bid clubs second time rather than 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course, we can see it's better|pg||
nt|athene: but there are many hands north might have with, say, two hearts, where you score more in 4@H than 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: you can't bid 4@C to offer the choice because that isn't forcing|pg||
nt|athene: and you have way too much playing strength|pg||
nt|athene: even when partner has only one heart, 4@H will often be fine|pg||
nt|athene: it's just that it isn't here|pg||
nt|mathat: martens dbl promises 1005 other color|pg||
nt|athene: i am not saying 4@H was clearly right|pg||
