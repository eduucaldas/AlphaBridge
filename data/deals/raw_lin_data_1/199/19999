nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: easy 4@H to start with |pg||
nt|othered1: A routine strong NT auction, perhaps, but today 4th seat 1N openers are relatively rare,  as someone finds a reason to open in front of them|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck: going for some xruff maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: that may not work well if he loses 2@s, 1@h, 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, his best chance would be to get @d fin right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks to be a dull 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: simple 3 nt with 9 (or 10) tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|danilo1: 8 topp tricks ... but guess any lead by West will find ninth one (difficult to immagine @C lead)|pg||

nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently he did try the x ruff & went down as suspected|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on 6@H good save|pg||
nt|bobholl: and a likely push|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of room for differing actions on this  hand, beginning with east's possible opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of options for the auction here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|zebutin: mighty try even 7@D|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone know their 1N range?|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: the correct side will start bidding @d soon :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like their  headed to a @S fit|pg||
mb|4D|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
mb|d|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|d6|nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: lead was easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: NV, may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow not best defence|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|pc|c3|nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||

nt|Vugraphzcn: here is the composition of the teams http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/teams.htm|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  But not immediately obvious how all the information needed will be communicated in the auction|pg||
nt|ugis: 6H now is probably the best bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: E concerned about the @H|pg||
mb|7S|nt|ugis: W with all those H bids 7|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: even though E is not sure he has 13 tricks 7 is a resonable shot|pg||
nt|ugis: well, even though it makes, it was gambling by E|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|mcphee: I suppose it is easy enough for W to hold just Axx @H|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, the only bad shape for W is 5-4 in the majors. If he is 5-3, the @cK provides a pitch for the third heart|pg||

nt|psyck: Hi Sunil|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi CK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in San Marino, one of the smallest countries in the world|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Ed, Bob|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a  hand that big @C systems handle quite well.|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good 7@H and biddable if S can show his singleton @C|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Henry!|pg||
nt|bobholl: think any reasanoble line will let 4@S make|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  a small @c first improuves a little defense options|pg||
nt|Walddk2: San Marino is a state situated on the Italian peninsula on the eastern side of the Apennine Mountains. It is an enclave surrounded by Italy. Its size is just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with an estimated population of over 30,000. Its capital is the City of San Marino. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe|pg||
nt|aramesh: arranging commentators for european small federation games vugraph|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bobholl: raptor would be pretty to have in W |pg||
nt|bobholl: hi henry :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry N :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: Not quite a 2@C bid, because  you run out of rebids pretty quickly|pg||
nt|phil: yes, declarer gets a good count on the hand when the 3rd diamond is played. I do think its stronger for North to duck that heart though, don;t you think? |pg||
mb|d|nt|sunsamvar: BRAVE 1 NT BY e|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but it will make nevertheless|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: P cud be yarborough|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: some like sandwich NT (for other suits) & some like nat NT (since opps often open & respond light & steal you blind)...|pg||
nt|othered1: 7 is an excellent spot and may be biddable.  |pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland has the 'R' convention closely trailing the F & G conventions in the list of avoidable ones|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt x on a @S  lead :) wouldn't have found that :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bobholl: @S guess solved now so will make|pg||
nt|phil: me neither :)|pg||
nt|phil: but even on a heart, there arent a lot of tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 2@S transfer and 2nt acceptance|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sunsamvar: true CK but still a brave bid at unfav vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: playing NT as nat in that position, I would also bid 1NT|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: on their way to 7 i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck:  I play 1@s by E as 4+ cards & x with less|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now making as crucial entry got|pg||
mb|6C|nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
nt|othered1: This would be a v ery easy Blue Team Club auction, where south would show an ace and a king on his first response, then @H fit, then cue-bidding should focus on t he value of the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
mb|6S|nt|othered1: 5@S-7@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller would reach this surely with their tarzan precision|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|7S|nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
mc|13|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if s still interested N has an easy 7 @H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: well done..|pg||
nt|henryb:  Whatever the bids meant, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while,  Bye for now.|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and play will present no problem with @S 32|pg||

nt|bobholl: 6@H goes for 800 so better pass :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that D by N. maybe 4H is better, planning to correct spades to NT for minors|pg||
nt|phil: with a void heart, its unlikely the w/r opponents are bidding 4@h, so maybe the mild overbid of 4N is best? |pg||

mb|4H|nt|psyck:  4@h could make even if you get trumps wrong|pg||
nt|bobholl: only objection against double is only 3 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like any plan that strongly emphasizes the minors, as pd is likely to have a fit. i think the double was based on the fear that S had 18 balanced and that 3N was the only game. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: narrow target to try to hit|pg||

nt|danilo1: if 3@D would be forcing, ! would choose 3@D rather than jump to 3NT|pg||

nt|danilo1: anyone for 2@C NV vs. voul |pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 in hand is the threat but in that case Nwould have played @SK to kill the squeeze|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not me|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: and dedication@H@H@H And, of course, thanks a lot for all KIBITZERS for watching this event! @H@H@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: now double in N ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't understand either|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|bobholl: and s 3@S now ?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: bid your best minor i will support you then |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  2N, in my world, says two places to play|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: me and my partner would have done not that good on this one 1nt 2@C and than 4@H :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: may be i direct 4/5 @D would agree @S :(|pg||
pc|sK|nt|blewah: yes, that would be the intention too|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|blewah: W just wanted to knoe keycards in @s excluding in @d|pg||
pc|s9|nt|blewah: *know|pg||
nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer should lead the @hJ next|pg||

nt|zebutin: would be sad to bid 6@H after 4/5@D and see partner change it to 6@S...|pg||
nt|blewah: ow, that would be sad|pg||
nt|psyck: he should have set suit with 3@h on 2@d as suggested, then had enough options|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 6@S 7@D ??|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bobholl: bit strong for a NV 2@H isn't it ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how do you guess the singleton @D as east ??|pg||
nt|bobholl: he just tries to get the contract cheap :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  @s is a strange (to my eyes) choice|pg||
mb|4S|nt|phil: tempting to pass with those club tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt looks sound enough but on a @S lead not that good :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: setting up @h suit and assume captaincy with a void is usually tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: on any lead but small @D at least 1 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to go wrong here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3@S a good tactical choice |pg||
nt|phil: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 7@D goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  especially since it does not clue partner in at all|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck:  3N could be in trouble with the @c break|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: which is why i suggested that W should give up chances of grand & settle for the practical way to reach 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: east afraid of his weak @S i guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|phil: still OK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  If you were going to bid 4@s, why not bid 4@c on the way?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Harald Skjæran and Danilo Stojanovic|pg||
nt|bobholl: so far for good tactics :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: very good @D Q keeps communication and not a ruff yet :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: and to CK|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck:  e.g. a @s lead duck all around would probably beat 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 100 better than -180 but 140 is better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: it worked in the end :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, practical bid is a good one if you haven't discussed science with p|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: after 2@d-3@h-3@s cue- he still has option of exclusion key card ask of 5@d|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|skjaeran:  Nice defence by north|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|skjaeran:  Established communications to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: even if S did not want to bid 2@h on 1@h other table (in case it showed better hand?) he should have bid it on 1@S|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|zebutin: yes i think on previous deal you easily can find 7 if you have that in cards, if you start with 3@H|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck:  Declarer just hoping for @s44 or some such fav lie of cards|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@h here is pretty normal, i think but i don't know about W's pass|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: Not sure what the redouble shows for them here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: system with 2@D as multi or MF could reach 6@H in east |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|blewah: i usually play wide range of overcall|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobholl: why not J@H ?|pg||

nt|zebutin: or might try something that needs 14 cards on one opponent to work|pg||
nt|psyck: My counting is often limited to 1, 2, 3, many.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 3N SHOULD BE EASY|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|bobholl: poor n has to find a bid |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 nt would be my choice|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N perhaps?|pg||
nt|bobholl: same choice |pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s possible but unattractive on that suit|pg||
nt|phil: nice fit here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|danilo1: excellent by N ... he knew by the lead declarer max single @S ... to note - @SK would lead to 3NT made ... since than time for declarer to establish 3 @H tricks |pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C suffers from bad finesses|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c now|pg||
nt|zebutin: East did the disciplined thing by passing twice...i might have been tempted to bid 2@S at some point...sad to admit... :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass?????????|pg||
nt|bobholl: is that a suit ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mathat: 3 nt and 5 1c only|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if you pass the S  hand which is defendable|pg||
nt|phil: wouldnt occur to me to open that South trash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt occur to me to pass at these colors:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would open but with an 11-13 NT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strange lead if P couldn't bid 1 @S |pg||
nt|henryb:  a strange lead given that partner could not make a negative double |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  great commenters think alike|pg||
pc|hK|nt|skjaeran:  Not the worst of slams, but should stop below the 6-level.|pg||
nt|mathat: 4 @c mb|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3C was forcing|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|blewah: i would have entered in the 2nd chance too, Seppo|pg||

nt|marlowepi: N dicing with death|pg||
nt|bobholl: in @C only 4 :(|pg||

nt|mathat: to pass|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|phil: I thought South was endplayed into it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|skjaeran:  I'm told 2NT asked for aces.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt is so often superior to 5 of a minor and not only in pairs :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: @S lead and 1 down :(|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: yes, several chances, none of which work here|pg||
nt|psyck: except @d lead :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E had no real reason to double 3S, which only gives more options to NS. on this auction W was already going to  lead a spade eevn with a void|pg||
pc|h3|nt|skjaeran:  By a reliable source|pg||
nt|granguru:  so 2@c must be a relay according @h|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|skjaeran:  3NT asked for cuebids|pg||
nt|bobholl: will try to ruff out @H Q and than @D finesse :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h6|nt|granguru:  i would guess 2@d is a bal hand|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  3H=2 without Q|pg||
nt|granguru:  3n IS A NEW ASKING|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk on 5@D ... Sould shoud bid slam (or 5@S) ... already shown no slam interest before|pg||
nt|psyck: @h drop, @d fin, squeeze, all in vain|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|bobholl: guess this is a 70% slam or so|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck:  with @hq & @cK known to be missing, N did not fancy the slam|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|s5|nt|zebutin: would opponent really cover from Q9xx?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: bye Shirley:)|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: this hand has an awful lot of bits and pieces in the majors, and too much overall defense, to be ideal for the 2N opening|pg||
nt|mcphee: agree|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mcphee: we use Ripstra over this minor bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just begging them to bid a game they wont beat, and which wouldnt have been bid otherwise|pg||
nt|mcphee: so a bid of a minor = better minor for major suit t/o|pg||
nt|mcphee: once you know your partner holds both majors reaching game is not so far fetchced|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is something that inveterate pre-emptors often fail to be honest with themselves about when assessing the effectiveness of their tactics. preemots are good, but selective ones ...|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: despite the gentle critique of the S opening, it is the imprudent N call that sealed the NS fate. N has some defense, true, but ALL his stuff is in his partners suits. his goal ...|pg||
