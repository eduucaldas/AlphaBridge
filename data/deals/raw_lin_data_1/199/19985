mb|2S|nt|rodal f: A @D hook and..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@S  a second suit is ALWAYS longer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=@H & @D   this is a version of Ghestem|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: "but i had 2 spades"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL just shows values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 10-13 HCP, 5+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the canape opening looks like big winner here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: 2N Relay    3@D i think = short @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm really only confident of opening bid and response|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, that's what being stated in their CC. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at other tables  East will open 1@H  warning South of the dangers|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: That might killed NS.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if vP's DBL absolutely confirms a canape   4@S 5+@H   and that must be why Verhees thinking|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: What do 3@H mean now?|pg||
nt|athene: obviously south intends it as a strong spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you pass lots and then bid opps' suit it is natural, but not usually in a major, that promised five cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u|pg||
nt|athene: might have been easier if north had bid 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that wasn't natural for them|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@S over 1@S was natural then the delayed 2@S is weaker i suppose in which case he has a super-max hand and must surely bid game now|pg||
nt|athene: probably he should bid game anyway :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: When I was younger than now I loved to follow NS as players, They are god vine.|pg||
nt|twcho: so 3@h is probably another relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fantoni will just keep asking for more information artificially|pg||
nt|twcho: thus unbal promised shortness somewhere?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it could also be 6(322)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BBO only shows 1 of the 4 matches each round|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do W have press here? Agree u at the 3@HX as end.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: and will NOT have 4+ other major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is a Chinese site that sometimes shows a different match, but not right now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: north trying to cater for everything|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room Brink 2@DX South|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|twcho: on the right track|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i spy on the other table without login using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that also allows listening to Voice Commentary|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: just in case 3@H is saying "i have hearts stopped, do you have diamonds stopped?"|pg||
nt|twcho: to the cold slam|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: or maybe he knows exactly what 3@H means and he thinks 3nt might be best spot|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: EW  upside down count & attitude   odd/even 1st discard|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|twcho: do they play turbo?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they do -- but i'm never sure when it applies|pg||
nt|twcho: I think it will apply here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the newcomers    NS  2 bids all show  10-13 HCP, 5+ suit, unbal    1 bids all forcing 1 round, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: the system is known as Fantunes|pg||

nt|xenya: takes a @H ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|bobholl: wouldn't t have been clearer ?|pg||
nt|kamras: wasn't exactly a high one in context|pg||
nt|kamras: In closed Upmark played the King|pg||
nt|kamras: well - if the 8 was the right card West would've played a long time ago :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 = I'm not sure|pg||
nt|kemperg: but what chances are there with @D H10 ?|pg||
nt|kamras: Since East doesn't know West has all remaining @Cs, how should one signal hear? From East's perspective a continuation might be best on some layouts|pg||
nt|xenya: the question is can @HA be wrong on any layout?|pg||

pc|h7|nt|twcho: 0 or 3 keys|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it raises interesting talking point -- should there ever be Barometer scoring in this type of event?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so -- Upmark would know to risk 7@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Nystrom -- whoever finds out @SK is missing|pg||
nt|twcho: but still he may go down in 7|pg||
