nt|vugraphzmu: y|pg||
nt|nsriram: Rajesh must have thought 4@C was cue for @D|pg||
nt|nsriram: but Anil thought all natural|pg||
nt|figo:  ambitious and dangerous |pg||
nt|figo:  potential confusion , when S was ur own first bid suit |pg||
nt|nsriram: I am sure both will have convincing arguments to prove their point of view is correct :)|pg||
nt|nsriram: Personally I am on Anil's side. What would Rajesh do with 6-6 in blacks say?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmu: rajesh bid 4@C as cue for @D|pg||
nt|figo:  another point is N wont be strong hand , he didnt make a jump shift on 1S , if they play it that way ( playing Precision )|pg||
nt|nsriram: especially if 3@C was fourth suit|pg||
nt|figo:  and many players open Majot first though minor is 6 cards |pg||
nt|nsriram: depends on how you play it. Some play jump shift shows concentrated values rather than any maximum|pg||
