nt|fluffy: long as I know|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: I think East opened a multi 2@d showing a weak in a major hand or 22-23 balanced|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|fluffy: some might be surprised by the decision of Norberto to show a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: it is a very common "lie" to show a balanced hand with 4441 and 5431 with a stiff King or Ace|pg||
nt|fluffy: the reason is that showing your shape, specially 4441 across as well as strenght is very complicated, takes 3 rounds of bidding, and in the end partner is unsure if you have 18 or ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: 23|pg||

pc|c3|nt|bigtrain: looks like declarer will lose the race to 7 here|pg||
nt|fluffy: graupera makes an agressive switch now, clubs would be great if partner had @cA or @cJ, but sadly he has neither this time|pg||

nt|fluffy: oh well didn't expect a 1NT overcall with @sKx|pg||
mb|d|nt|fluffy: that is something I would never do, I don't like playing NT when I win first trick but the opponents have 4-5 tricks ready for the next time they get in|pg||
nt|pelu: most players would X in East 3 "suirs" to play - and 4 card @h|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|fluffy: doubling instead with good support for all the other suits is IMO superior, but obviously Norberto is better than me, so who knows|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2NT by W = both minors????|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: becasue it would be one level higher probably|pg||
mb|3D!|an|cuebid|mb|p|nt|fluffy: I don't really understand what Graupera is up to|pg||

nt|pelu: on way to 4@S (making)|pg||
nt|fluffy: its up to partnership agreements, but if yo have a shapelly hand that wants to invite to 4@s over 1NT the proper bid is 2NT|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|fluffy: when opponents open or overcall a strong NT, you can use the 2NT bid as a cuebid when partner shows a suit|pg||
nt|pelu: depend on system agreements - many would X first|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: yes, but it doesn't take much imagination to construct a hand where 1NT X makes and so does 4@s|pg||
