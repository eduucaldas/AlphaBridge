mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: you might get away with 3nt if south plays it|pg||
nt|athene: if east just shows both majors|pg||
nt|roghog: or even 5@c by S|pg||
nt|athene: but south won't be rushing to declare the notrumps after east showed majors haha|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: usually these hands play better with the overcaller on lead - but not here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5C by South looks quite good on a non-heart lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: some would bid 3@s showing a singleton (on the way to 3 NT or 5 minor)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@h for e-w here - interesting that NS are the ones who have to sac, despite having 24 hcp between them|pg||
nt|casenjo:  well, now how does e-w find the heart fit?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|athene: south can transfer to clubs - but what is his follow-up? 4@D splinter goes past 3nt|pg||

pc|h8|nt|jbgood: but as many have pointed out, no good idea to make N declarer on this one|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even reasonable to expect partner to read it as such without agreement, after east showed majors|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: but you might equally well think it shows a stop in spades and concern about hearts|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: if north had the ace she was surely going to play it|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|d4|nt|athene: and dummy has no entry so there is no chance of getting the club loser away|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d5|nt|athene: and it just meant declarer lost a tempo and also lost the chance to lead a spade from dummy |pg||

mb|p|nt|casenjo:  with 21 HCP and partner opening, there should be some fireworks|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: hard to see any way you could miss 4@H, assuming a modicum of sanity|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes 5nt grand slam force gets bid somewhere along the line|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  another reason to show extra long spades|pg||
nt|casenjo:  looking at the AK, you don't need too many honors|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  6 spades was bid and made at the other table, so this will be a nice pick up for either side|pg||
nt|athene: if there is the slightest question-mark over trump solidity, a singleton trump won't be a good lead|pg||
nt|casenjo:  North is forced in one line of play, being short on dummy entries and should makethis|pg||
nt|athene: "always lead a trump against a grand slam" is one of the sillier mottos anyway, i think|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: he can claim 11 now|pg||

nt|athene: this is the sort of hand that can take an age to think about|pg||
nt|athene: because you are just trying to maximise your %|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Years ago Alan Truscott put in a hand I defended, where  i did NOT over-ruff the dummy and it was the only way to beat the contract (I was stubborn since it was my male partner at that time that had said "women liketo ruff" :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|athene: EW have lots of hcp between them but how good is 3nt going to be on the heart lead?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: this is a situation where, as east, you really want just a slightly better spot card in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: may need some undo-ing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bidding does not look right - South's 2@D is a Multi where hearts is the long suit if the hand is weak|pg||
nt|athene: ok, are we assuming this was a multi auction? 2@D from west, 2@H from east, 3nt from west? seems a bit ugly|pg||
nt|jbgood: operator, perhaps you could just score the board and go on with the next one?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: even something like A9xx or A8xx can turn into a double stop if partner has a bit to offer|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|baldjean: but a bit too weak  for my sromach|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|baldjean: I play a variation of step responses with my partner, and 2nt would indeed show 10 points|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: not sure there is much point doubling 3@D - on these puppet auctions, south never gets to play it|pg||
nt|athene: it just helps north with the play|pg||
nt|baldjean: the variation is that if opener is intnere4sted in sklam now she can ask for aces and kings with a waiting bid|pg||
nt|casenjo:  a diamond ruff in dummy makes 10|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|athene: but maybe East has decided that she is going to lead a diamond against 3n anyway and that will tell declarer what she has in the suit|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: not completely safe as south could have a very strong hand but still a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps a case for the spade jack?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the jack is possible as it will clear up the suit for west|pg||

pc|hK|nt|athene: she doesn't want to use up the @SA for the small extra chances given by leading a club from hand|pg||

pc|h7|nt|jbgood: doesnt matter now, but if S had some other spade holding|pg||
